The objective of this study was to determine the distribution of Blastocystis genetic subtypes in different animal species in United Arab Emirates. A total of 114 stool samples were tested using PCR of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene and sequence analysis. Twenty-three Blastocystis-positive samples were identified. The following detection rates were observed: cattle, 22.7%; sheep, 63.6%; rabbits, 33.3%; rodents, 37.%; reptiles, 21.2%. Four subtypes were identified in this study; ST4, ST10, ST14, and ST17; ST10 was isolated from sheep and cattle, corroborating previous data indicating that these are natural hosts for this subtype. Cases of mixed subtype  were also detected. Conspicuously, we found ST14 in rabbits. The discovery of ST17 in a squirrel indicates a novel host for this subtype. Furthermore, the discovery of ST4 in rodents suggests that these may serve as reservoir for human Blastocystis ST4 . Six tortoises and one iguana were positive for Blastocystis. In conclusion, this is the first report of Blastocystis infection in various animals in the UAE. Apart from ST4, no potentially zoonotic subtypes were detected.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

This prospective observational study investigated bacterial airway , and whether its detection and quantification in the endotracheal aspirate (ETA) is useful for identifying mechanically ventilated ICU patients who are at risk of developing VAP.240 patients admitted to 3 ICUs at the Lahey Hospital and Medical Center (Burlington, MA) between June 2014 and June 2015 and mechanically ventilated for > 2 days were included. ETA samples and clinical data were collected. Airway  was assessed, and subsequently categorized into "heavy" and "light" by semi-quantitative microbiological analysis of ETAs. VAP was diagnosed retrospectively by the study sponsor according to a pre-specified pneumonia definition.Pathogenic bacteria were isolated from ETAs of 125 patients. The most common species isolated was S. aureus (56.8%), followed by K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli (35.2% combined). VAP was diagnosed in 85 patients, 44 (51.7%) with no bacterial pathogen, 18 associated with S. aureus and 18 Gram-negative-only cases, and  associated with other Gram-positive or mixed species. A higher proportion of patients who were heavily colonized with S. aureus developed VAP (32.4%) associated with S. aureus compared to those lightly colonized (17.6%). The same tendency was seen for patients heavily and lightly colonized with Gram-negative pathogens (30.0 and 0.0%, respectively). Detection of S. aureus in the ETA preceded S. aureus VAP by approximately 4 days, while Gram-negative organisms were first detected 2. days prior to Gram-negative VAP. VAP was associated with significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation and hospitalization regardless of microbiologic cause when compared to patients who did not develop VAP.The overall VAP rate was 35%. Heavy tracheal  supported identification of patients at higher risk of developing a corresponding S. aureus or Gram-negative VAP. Detection of bacterial ETA-positivity tended to precede VAP.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555982>ECM-Mimetic Multiresponsive Nanobullets Targeted Against Metastasizing Circulating Tumor Clusters in Breast Cancer.</a></h1><p>Targeting smaller populations of circulating tumor clusters (CTC) with tumor-initiating and  potentials at distant sites in circulation remains a challenge as clusters possess both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics. Bullet shaped ellipsoidal nanostructures of size 600 ± 11.3 nm (major axis) and 281.9 ± .3 nm (minor axis) with 2.2 aspect ratio were self-assembled using inorganic and organic GRAS biomaterials to preferentially target tumor-causing CTCs. Negatively-charged chondroitin sulfate in presence of gelatin guides unidirectional growth of calcium carbonate mesocrystals to form nanobullets, mediates CD44 targeting of CTCs. Switchable multi-responsive drug release profiles (temperature and pH) were recorded for nanobullets promoting spontaneous and efficient cell-killing. CD44 and E-cadherin overexpressing 'seeding' cell clusters of 170 ± 22 µm were developed as in vitro CTC model. pH responsive release of Dox into lysosome stimulates calcium influx resulting in cell death. CD44-blocked CTCs showed significantly reduced internalization when compared to CD44-expressing CTCs thereby confirming CD44 specific internalization of nanobullets. Significantly retarded expansion of clusters when shifted to cell adhesive surfaces depicts the potential of nanobullets against  of CTCs. Hence, newer insights on developed anisotropic ECM-mimetic nanohybrids would enhance targeted capture of tumor-initiating clusters in systemic circulation that would potentially reduce the progression of tumor in breast cancer patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613012>Understanding interaction effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in rice under elevated carbon dioxide conditions.</a></h1><p>Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), particularly the Glomerales group, play a paramount role in plant nutrient uptake, and abiotic and biotic stress management in rice, but recent evidence revealed that elevated CO concentration considerably reduces the Glomerales group in soil. In view of this, the present study was initiated to understand the interaction effect of native Glomerales species application in rice plants (cv. Naveen) under elevated CO concentrations (400 ± 10, 550 ± 20, and 700 ± 20 ppm) in open-top chambers. Three different modes of application of the AMF inoculum were evaluated, of which, combined application of AMF at the seedling production and transplanting stages showed increased AMF , which significantly improved grain yield by 25.08% and also increased uptake of phosphorus by 18.2% and nitrogen by 49.%, as observed at 700-ppm CO concentration. Organic acids secretion in rice root increased in AMF-inoculated plants exposed to 700-ppm CO concentration. To understand the overall effect of CO elevation on AMF interaction with the rice plant, principal component and partial least square regression analysis were performed, which found both positive and negative responses under elevated CO concentration.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Multiple mutations were observed in three genes. Mutated genes included , , and , which are known to be associated with adaptation to murine. Other mutations were involved with chemoreceptor, pH regulator, and outer membrane proteins, which also have potential to influence on the adaptation to the new host.We confirmed mutations in genes previously reported to be associated with adaptation to Mongolian gerbils.

Flagella are considered a primary virulence factor in  as these organelles are required for pathogenicity-related phenotypes including motility, biofilm formation, host cell interactions, and host . The post-transcriptional regulator CsrA regulates the expression of the major flagellin FlaA by binding to  mRNA and repressing its translation. Additionally, CsrA has previously been shown to regulate 120-150 proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. The amino acid sequence of  CsrA is significantly different from that of  CsrA, and no previous research has defined the amino acids of  CsrA that are critical for RNA binding. In this study, we used  SELEX to identify the consensus RNA sequence mAwGGAs to which  CsrA binds with high affinity. We performed saturating site-directed mutagenesis on  CsrA and assessed the regulatory activity of these mutant proteins, using a reporter system encoding the ' untranslated region (' UTR) upstream of  linked translationally to the  gene. These assays allowed us to identify 19 amino acids that were involved in RNA binding by CsrA, with many but not all of these amino acids clustered in predicted beta strands that are involved in RNA binding by  CsrA. Decreased  mRNA binding by mutant CsrA proteins L2A and A36V was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The majority of the amino acids implicated in RNA binding were conserved among diverse  species.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630386>Concealed Penis after Circumcision: Is It Beneficial in Lowering Uropathogenic  in Penile Skin and Preventing Recurrence of Febrile Urinary Tract Infections?</a></h1><p>  To  discuss  whether  concealed  penis  after  circumcision  lowers  perimeatal  urethral  and  glanular  sulcus  uropathogenic  bacterial    in  healthy  boys  with  no  urinary  tract  problems  and  prevents  attacks  of  febrile  urinary  tract  infections  in  non-healthy  boys  with  defined  urinary  tract  abnormalities. Materials and Methods:  This  case-control  study  was  conducted  in  Ibn-i  Sina  Hospital  and  retrospectively  collected  data  of   471 boys  were  analyzed.  All  patients  were  scanned  for  any  urinary  tract  abnormality  and  those  with  any  defined  abnormalities  were  classified  as  non-healthy  group.

We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of oral vancomycin for the prevention of health care facility-onset CDI (HCFO-CDI) in targeted patients.We conducted a randomized, prospective, open-label study at Novant Health Forsyth Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina between October 2018 and April 2019. Included patients were randomized 1:1 to either oral vancomycin (dosed at 125 mg once daily while receiving systemic antibiotics and continued for  days post completion of systemic antibiotics [OVP]), or no prophylaxis. The primary endpoint was incidence of HCFO-CDI. Secondary endpoints included incidence of community-onset healthcare facility-associated CDI (CO-HCFA-CDI), incidence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE)  after receiving OVP, adverse effects and cost of OVP.A total of 100 patients were evaluated, 50 patients in each arm. Baseline and hospitalization characteristics were similar, except antibiotic exposure. No events of HCFO-CDI were noted in the OVP group compared to 6 (12%) in the no prophylaxis group (p = 0.03). CO-HCFA-CDI was identified in 2 patients who were previously diagnosed with HCFO-CDI. No patients developed new VRE  with only 1 patient reporting mild gastrointestinal side effects to OVP. A total of 600 doses of OVP were given during the study, with each patient receiving an average of 12 doses. Total acquisition cost of OVP was $1302, $26.04 per patient.OVP appears to protect against HCFO-CDI during in-patient stay in targeted patients during systemic antibiotic exposure.

Ascochitine was mainly produced from mature hyphae at the site of pycnidial formation, suggesting a possible protective role of the compound against other microbial competitors in nature. This report highlights the evolution of gene clusters harnessing the structural diversity of polyketides and a mechanism with the potential to alter secondary metabolite profiles via single nucleotide polymorphisms in closely related fungal species. Fungi produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites, many of which are of pharmacological importance whereas many others are noted for mycotoxins, such as aflatoxin and citrinin, that can threaten human and animal health. The polyketide-derived compound ascochitine, which is structurally similar to citrinin mycotoxin, has been considered to be important for pathogenicity of legume-associated  species. Here, we identified the ascochitine polyketide synthase (PKS) gene in  and its neighboring genes that may be involved in ascochitine biosynthesis. Interestingly, the ascochitine PKS genes in other legume-associated  species have been mutated, encoding truncated PKSs. This indicated that point mutations may have contributed to genetic diversity for secondary metabolite production in these fungi. We also demonstrated that ascochitine is not a pathogenicity factor in  The antifungal activities and production of ascochitine during sporulation suggested that it may play a role in competition with other saprobic fungi in nature.Copyright © 2019 Kim et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669781>Scophthalmus maximus interleukin-1β limits Edwardsiella piscicida  in vivo.</a></h1><p>Interleukine-1β (IL-1β) is the first identified pro-inflammatory cytokine, which is cleaved by caspase-1 following the inflammasomes activation, playing critical roles in innate immunity. However, few studies have been performed to characterize the IL-1β in lower vertebrates. Herein, we distinguished the Scophthalmus maximus IL-1β (SmIL-1β) from three IL-1β like sequences and found that SmIL-1β was cleaved by S. maximus caspase at a non-conserved Asp, then targeted to the plasma membrane.

Recent evidence indicates that biofilm-dispersed bacteria have transcriptional features different from those of both biofilm and planktonic bacteria. In this study, the in vitro and in vivo phenotypic properties of  cells spontaneously dispersed from biofilm were compared with those of planktonic and sessile cells. Biofilm-dispersed cells, whose growth rate was the same as that of exponential planktonic bacteria but significantly higher than those of sessile and stationary planktonic forms, colonized both abiotic and biotic surfaces more efficiently than their planktonic counterparts regardless of their initial adhesion capabilities. Microscopy studies suggested that dispersed bacteria initiate formation of microcolonies more rapidly than planktonic bacteria. In addition, dispersed cells have both a higher engulfment rate and better survival/multiplication inside macrophages than planktonic cells and sessile cells. In an in vivo murine pneumonia model, the bacterial load in mice lungs infected with biofilm-dispersed bacteria was similar at 6, 24 and 48 h after infection to that of mice lungs infected with planktonic or sessile bacteria. However, biofilm-dispersed and sessile bacteria trend to elicit innate immune response in lungs to a lesser extent than planktonic bacteria. Collectively, the findings from this study suggest that the greater ability of  biofilm-dispersed cells to efficiently achieve surface  and to subvert the host immune response confers them substantial advantages in the first steps of the infection process over planktonic bacteria.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31530671>Lrg1 Regulates β (1,3)-Glucan Masking in Candida albicans through the Cek1 MAP Kinase Pathway.</a></h1><p> is among the most prevalent opportunistic human fungal pathogens.

The ability to mask the immunogenic cell wall polymer β (1,3)-glucan from host immune surveillance contributes to fungal virulence. We previously reported that the hyperactivation of the Cek1 MAP kinase cascade promotes cell wall unmasking, thus increasing strain immunogenicity. In this study, we identified a novel regulator of the Cek1 pathway called Lrg1. Lrg1 is a predicted GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that represses Cek1 activity by downregulating the GTPase Cdc42 and its downstream MAPKKK, Ste11. Upregulation of Cek1 activity diminished fungal virulence in the mouse model of infection, and this correlates with increased cytokine responses from macrophages. We also analyzed the transcriptional profile determined during β (1,3)-glucan exposure driven by Cek1 hyperactivation. Our report provides a model where Cek1 hyperactivation causes β (1,3)-glucan exposure by upregulation of cell wall proteins and leads to more robust immune detection , promoting more effective clearance.Copyright © 2019 Chen et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31440584>Stem cells, immortality, and the evolution of metastatic properties in breast cancer: telomere maintenance mechanisms and metastatic evolution.</a></h1><p>Breast cancer is the most significant cause of cancer-related death in women around the world. The vast majority of breast cancer-associated mortality stems from metastasis, which remains an incurable disease state. Metastasis results from evolution of clones that possess the insidious properties required for dissemination and  of distant organs. These clonal populations are descended from breast cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are also responsible for their prolonged maintenance and continued evolution. Telomeres impose a lifespan on cells that can be extended when they are actively elongated, as occurs in CSCs. Thus, changes in telomere structure serve to promote the survival of CSCs and subsequent metastatic evolution. The selection of telomere maintenance mechanism (TMM) has important consequences not only for CSC survival and evolution, but also for their coordination of various signaling pathways that choreograph the metastatic cascade. Targeting the telomere maintenance machinery may therefore provide a boon to the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Here we review the two major TMMs and the roles they play in the development of stem and metastatic breast cancer cells. We also highlight current and future approaches to targeting these mechanisms in clinical settings to alleviate metastatic breast cancers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31509184>Impact of Laboratory Methods,  Density and Age on Detection of Streptococcus Pneumoniae in the Nasopharynx.</a></h1><p>Culture-based methods for detecting Streptococcus pneumoniae in the nasopharynx lack sensitivity. This study aimed to compare the performance of culture and molecular methods in detecting pneumococcus in the nasopharynx of healthy individuals and to evaluate the effects of age and  density on detection. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from healthy individuals from 2010-2012 on the Navajo Nation and White Mountain Apache Tribal lands in the United States. Pneumococci were detected by broth-enrichment culture and quantitative lytA polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Among 982 individuals (median age: 18.7 years; male: 47%) evaluated, 3 % were culture positive and an additional 27% were qPCR positive. Agreement between culture and qPCR was 70.9%, but higher among children <18 (75.9%-84.4%) than adults ≥18 years of age (61.0%-74.6%). The mean density of  was lower for culture negative than positive samples (.02 vs. 3.14 log10 copies/milliliter) overall, and for all age groups. The percent culture positive increased with increasing density, exceeding 80% above 10,000 copies/milliliter. Mean  density decreased with age. Use of qPCR improved detection of pneumococcus in the nasopharynx of healthy individuals.

However, China's largest continental group of islands, the Zhoushan Archipelago, was neglected by most studies focusing on biodiversity hotspots. Here we investigated the phylogeographic patterns and the historical demography of two sympatric hemipteran insects (Geisha distinctissima and Megacopta cribraria), which shared historical factors in the Zhoushan Archipelago. The results based on mtDNA (COX1, COX2-COX3, and CYTB) and nDNA (28S and ITS2) showed that G. distinctissima diverged into three genetic lineages (L1-L3) ~8.9-13.7 thousand years ago (kya), which coincided with the period of island isolation. However, the three lineages exhibit no clear phylogeographic patterns for frequent asymmetrical gene flow (starting around  kya) from the mainland and adjacent islands to other distant islands due to subsequent human activities. In contrast, only one genetic lineage exists for M. cribraria, without any phylogeographic structures. The ancestral range in the mainland as well as in neighboring islands, together with the frequent asymmetrical gene flow of M. cribraria (from the mainland and neighboring islands to more distant islands) within the last 5000 years suggests that human activities may have lead to the  of this species in the Zhoushan Archipelago. The contrasting genetic structures indicate shared historical factors but independent evolutionary histories for the two sympatric species in the Zhoushan Archipelago. Our demographic analysis clearly showed that both species underwent population expansion before  kya during the post-LGM (Last Glacial Maximum), which indicates that the two species shared concordant historical demographies. This result suggests that the population size of the two species was affected similarly by the climatic oscillations of post-LGM in Eastern China. Together, our findings reveal that the two insect species in the Zhoushan Archipelago exhibit contrasting genetic structures despite concordant historical demographies, which provides an important framework for the exploration of the evolution patterns of sympatric species in the continental island.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31477894>Intestinal serotonin and fluoxetine exposure modulate bacterial  in the gut.</a></h1><p>The gut microbiota regulates levels of serotonin (-hydroxytryptamine (-HT)) in the intestinal epithelium and lumen. However, whether -HT plays a functional role in bacteria from the gut microbiota remains unknown. We demonstrate that elevating levels of intestinal lumenal -HT by oral supplementation or genetic deficiency in the host -HT transporter (SERT) increases the relative abundance of spore-forming members of the gut microbiota, which were previously reported to promote host -HT biosynthesis. Within this microbial community, we identify Turicibacter sanguinis as a gut bacterium that expresses a neurotransmitter sodium symporter-related protein with sequence and structural homology to mammalian SERT. T. sanguinis imports -HT through a mechanism that is inhibited by the selective -HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. -HT reduces the expression of sporulation factors and membrane transporters in T. sanguinis, which is reversed by fluoxetine exposure. Treating T. sanguinis with -HT or fluoxetine modulates its competitive  in the gastrointestinal tract of antibiotic-treated mice. In addition, fluoxetine reduces the membership of T. sanguinis in the gut microbiota of conventionally colonized mice. Host association with T. sanguinis alters intestinal expression of multiple gene pathways, including those important for lipid and steroid metabolism, with corresponding reductions in host systemic triglyceride levels and inguinal adipocyte size. Together, these findings support the notion that select bacteria indigenous to the gut microbiota signal bidirectionally with the host serotonergic system to promote their fitness in the intestine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31442185>Do Gutter Guards Affect Mosquito Production in Roof Gutter Habitats?</a></h1><p>Roof gutters on houses that have become inundated with leaf litter and cannot drain properly are an often-overlooked man-made container habitat that is suitable for mosquito larval development. In order to reduce the amount of leaf litter debris in gutters, many homeowners install debris screens, commonly referred to as "gutter guards," on their roof gutters, but no study has examined the effect of gutter guards on mosquito production. The objective of this research was to determine the extent to which different types of gutter guards affect mosquito  and abundance of juvenile mosquitoes in gutter habitats. Three experimental gutters, each with 1 of 3 treatments (control with no gutter guard, a metal lock-in mesh screen gutter guard, or a foam filter gutter insert), were placed at  field locations to monitor mosquito  and production over 8 wk. Pupae were collected daily, and eclosed adults were identified to species. Mosquitoes colonized and larvae developed in all gutters regardless of the presence of a guard, although those with the foam filter guards were least likely to be colonized ( < 0.001). Once colonized, the control gutters without a gutter guard had the lowest mosquito abundance ( < 0.001), and the metal lock-in gutters had the highest abundance ( < 0.001). The results suggest that if standing water exists in a gutter, gutter guards are not an effective tool for mosquito control.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666702>Immunity to commensal papillomaviruses protects against skin cancer.</a></h1><p>Immunosuppression increases the risk of cancers that are associated with viral infection. In particular, the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin-which has been associated with beta human papillomavirus (β-HPV) infection-is increased by more than 100-fold in immunosuppressed patients. Previous studies have not established a causative role for HPVs in driving the development of skin cancer. Here we show that T cell immunity against commensal papillomaviruses suppresses skin cancer in immunocompetent hosts, and the loss of this immunity-rather than the oncogenic effect of HPVs-causes the markedly increased risk of skin cancer in immunosuppressed patients. To investigate the effects of papillomavirus on carcinogen-driven skin cancer, we colonized several strains of immunocompetent mice with mouse papillomavirus type 1 (MmuPV1). Mice with natural immunity against MmuPV1 after  and acquired immunity through the transfer of T cells from immune mice or by MmuPV1 vaccination were protected against skin carcinogenesis induced by chemicals or by ultraviolet radiation in a manner dependent on CD8 T cells. RNA and DNA in situ hybridization probes for 25 commensal β-HPVs revealed a significant reduction in viral activity and load in human skin cancer compared with the adjacent healthy skin, suggesting a strong immune selection against virus-positive malignant cells. Consistently, E7 peptides from β-HPVs activated CD8 T cells from unaffected human skin. Our findings reveal a beneficial role for commensal viruses and establish a foundation for immune-based approaches that could block the development of skin cancer by boosting immunity against the commensal HPVs present in all of our skin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560491>Risk factors associated with pulmonary exacerbations in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis.</a></h1><p>Cystic fibrosis patients develop pulmonary exacerbations (PEs) that require intravenous treatment. The objective of this study was to determine the risk factors associated with PEs and establish the percentage of patients who failed to recover their lung function.Observational, retrospective, cohort study. The medical records of cystic fibrosis patients seen at Hospital de Niños Ricardo Gutiérrez in 2013 were reviewed. Patients were divided into group 1, with PE (Fuchs criteria), and group 2, without PE.

However, the rate at which shrubs can colonize previously glaciated terrain in a warming world is largely unknown. Reconstructions of past vegetation dynamics in conjunction with climate records can provide critical insights into shrubification rates and controls on plant migration, but paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on pollen may be biased by the influx of exotic pollen to tundra settings. Here, we reconstruct past plant communities using sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA), which has a more local source area than pollen. We additionally reconstruct past temperature variability using bacterial cell membrane lipids (branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers) and an aquatic productivity indicator (biogenic silica) to evaluate the relative timing of postglacial ecological and climate changes at a lake on southern Baffin Island, Arctic Canada. The sedaDNA record tightly constrains the  of dwarf birch (Betula, a thermophilous shrub) to .9 ± 0.1 ka, ~3 ka after local deglaciation as determined by cosmogenic  Be moraine dating and >2 ka later than Betula pollen is recorded in nearby lake sediment. We then assess the paleovegetation history within the context of summer temperature and find that paleotemperatures were highest prior to 6.3 ka, followed by cooling in the centuries preceding Betula establishment. Together, these molecular proxies reveal that Betula  lagged peak summer temperatures, suggesting that inefficient dispersal, rather than climate, may have limited Arctic shrub migration in this region. In addition, these data suggest that pollen-based climate reconstructions from high latitudes, which rely heavily on the presence and abundance of pollen from thermophilous taxa like Betula, can be compromised by both exotic pollen fluxes and vegetation migration lags.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447204>The relation between positive screening results and MRSA infections in burn patients.</a></h1><p>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a key pathogen in burn patients. Several factors put them at increased risk of MRSA infection: partial loss of the skin barrier, the immune-compromising effects of burns, prolonged hospital stays, and invasive procedures. This study aims to find the relation between MRSA screening swab cultures taken within 48 h of admission, weekly surveillance cultures, and MRSA infection secondary to .The data of all burns patients admitted to the referral centre for burns from 2012 to 2016 were reviewed. MRSA cultures taken at admission and on weekly surveillance screening, including nasal, perianal, and wound swabs, were reviewed. To determine associations between MRSA  and infection rates, both MRSA-positive and MRSA-negative swab cultures were included in the analysis. Several risk factors were considered: age, gender, ethnicity, %TBSA, BAUX index, inhalational injury, ICU admission and days, need for ventilator support and days, length of stay (LOS) in hospital, and complications. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to predict correlations between positive swab cultures and risk factors.Data from 396 patients were reviewed. The median age at admission for the burn patients was 46 (IQR: 31-59) years. On admission, 2.% of patients were MRSA positive, whereas 17.9% were found to be MRSA positive on weekly surveillance screening. At surveillance, 60.6% developed an infection secondary to MRSA . An MRSA infection was not identified for any patient who did not have at least one positive admission or surveillance swab. A statistically significant association was found between any positive swab and MRSA infection (P < 0.001). The median number of complications reported in the MRSA-positive group was 2 (IQR: 1-3) versus 0 (IQR: 0-1) in the MRSA-negative group and the median length of hospital stay in the MRSA-positive group was 34. (IQR: 20.25-56.25) days versus 7 (IQR: 3-16) days in the MRSA-negative group (P < 0.001).Nosocomial MRSA  rates are high, and patients incurring infections experience a greater than average LOS in hospital and complications. Over 60% of patients who had a positive swab culture at surveillance developed an infection, whereas, no patient with a negative MRSA swab status developed an infection. Hence, pragmatic prevention strategies have to be implemented.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

The role of food processing conditions such as cleaning and disinfection procedures on antimicrobial resistance emergence should especially be investigated. In this work, the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella and the microbial ecology of associated surfaces communities were investigated in a pig slaughterhouse before and after cleaning and disinfection procedures. Salmonella were detected in 67% of samples and isolates characterization revealed the presence of 15 PFGE-patterns belonging to five serotypes: S.4,,12:i:-, Rissen, Typhimurium, Infantis and Derby. Resistance to ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and/or chloramphenicol was detected depending on serotypes. 16S rRNA-based bacterial diversity analyses showed that Salmonella surface associated communities were highly dominated by the Moraxellaceae family with a clear site-specific composition suggesting a persistent  of the pig slaughterhouse. Cleaning and disinfection procedures did not lead to a modification of Salmonella susceptibility to antimicrobials in this short-term study but they tended to significantly reduce bacterial diversity and favored some genera such as Rothia and Psychrobacter.

The serotonergic system has been heavily implicated in microbiota-gut-brain axis signaling, particularly in proof-of-principle studies in germ-free (GF) animals. One aspect of the serotonergic system that has been left unexplored in relation to the microbiota is the unique ability of the serotonin receptor 2C (-HT) to undergo post-transcriptional editing, which has been implicated in decreased receptor functionality. We investigated whether GF mice, with absent microbiota from birth, have altered -HT receptor expression and editing in the brain, and if  of the microbiota is able to restore editing patterns. Next, we investigated whether microbiota depletion later in life using a chronic antibiotic treatment could affect -HT receptor editing patterns in rats. We found that GF mice have an increased prevalence of the edited -HT receptor isoforms in the amygdala, hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, and striatum, which was partially normalized upon  post-weaning. However, no alterations were observed in the hypothalamus after microbiota depletion using an antibiotic treatment in adult rats. This suggests that alterations in the microbiome during development, but not later in life, could influence -HT receptor editing patterns. Overall, these results demonstrate that the microbiota affects -HT receptor editing in the brain and may inform novel therapeutic strategies in conditions in which -HT receptor editing is altered, such as depression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511334>Dual Reporting of Clostridioides difficile PCR and Predicted Toxin Result Based on PCR Cycle Threshold Reduces Treatment of Toxin-Negative Patients without Increases in Adverse Outcomes.</a></h1><p>Nucleic acid amplification tests are commonly used to diagnose  infection (CDI).

Recent studies indicate that lipid transfer from plants is essential for AM fungal ; however, the role of lipid transfer in arbuscule formation and the dynamics of lipid accumulation in arbuscules under low pH stress are far from well understood. In the symbiosis of tomato and Rhizophagus intraradices under contrasting pH conditions (pH 4. vs. pH 6.), we investigated arbuscule formation, nutrient uptake, alkaline phosphatase activity and lipid accumulation; examined the gene expression involved in phosphate transport, lipid biosynthesis and transfer and sugar metabolism; and visualized the lipid dynamics in arbuscules. Low pH greatly inhibited arbuscule formation, in parallel with reduced phospholipid fatty acids accumulation in AM fungus and decreased P uptake. This reduction was supported by the decreased expression of plant genes encoding lipid biosynthesis and transfer. More degenerating arbuscules were observed under low pH conditions, and neutral lipid fatty acids accumulated only in degenerating arbuscules. These data reveal that, under low pH stress, reduced lipid transfer from hosts to AM fungi is responsible for the inhibited arbuscule formation.© 2019 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31442141> and Maintenance of  and  From the Republic Of Korea.</a></h1><p>The  Hyrcanus Group in the Republic of Korea (ROK) consists of  morphologically indistinct species that can only be identified with certainty by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

We aimed to determine factors associated with hand hygiene adherence in NFs and to assess rates of ARO acquisition among healthcare personnel (HCP).HCP were observed during routine care at 6 NFs. We recorded hand hygiene adherence, glove use, activities, and time in room. HCP hands were cultured before and after patient care; patients and high-touch surfaces were cultured. HCP activities were categorized as high-versus low-risk for self-contamination. Multivariable regression was performed to identify predictors of hand hygiene adherence.We recorded 385 HCP observations and paired them with cultures performed before and after patient care. Hand hygiene adherence occurred in 96 of 352 observations (27.3%) before patient care and 165 of 358 observations (46.1%) after patient care. Gloves were worn in 169 of 376 observations (44.9%). Higher adherence was associated with glove use before patient care (odds ratio [OR], 2.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44-4.54) and after patient care (OR, 3.11; 95% CI, 1.77-.48).

The purpose of this study was firstly to determine the prevalence of pneumococcus carriage in a population of febrile infants in Marrakesh and secondly, to investigate the risk factors for carriage and the distribution of circulating serotypes.This prospective study was conducted from February to June 2017, in the pediatric emergency department of the Mother and Child Hospital of Mohammed VI University Hospital Centre (UHC) in Marrakesh. At total of 183febrile infants, aged 2-18months, were enrolled in this study and were swabbed for nasopharyngeal carriage. Pneumococci were cultured, identified, serotyped, and tested for penicillin susceptibility. Demographic data and risk factors for carriage were collected. The statistical analyses performed were the following: the analysis of the risk factors using logistic regression, the estimation of serotype diversity with the Simpson index, and the Chi test to compare serotype distribution in the prevaccination (a cohort of 660 healthy children, less than 2years old, in the Marrakesh region, in 2008-2009) and postvaccination periods.The prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage was 68.3%.

In total, vaccine serotypes accounted for 6.4% (n=8): 19F (n=2), 1 (n=2) and one strain for each of the following serotypes: 14, 23F, 6B, and 9V. Non-vaccine and nontypeable strains presented 63.2% and 23.2%, respectively, with dominance of serotypes 6A (6.4%), 15A/15F (.6%), 20, 22F/22A, 23B, and 11A/11D with a prevalence of 3.2%. The rate of pneumococcus strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin was 33.6%, of which 90.2% were non-vaccine serotypes and nontypeable strains. Serotype diversity increased in the postvaccination period and the effectiveness of PCV-10 against vaccine serotypes was estimated at 89.6%.An important change in the distribution of vaccine and non-vaccine serotypes was observed after the introduction of the PCVs. In fact, the prevalence of vaccine serotypes decreased significantly while non-vaccine serotypes emerged. These results underscore the importance of maintaining close and prolonged surveillance of serotype distribution to monitor the dynamics of nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage.Copyright © 2019 French Society of Pediatrics.

The pore structure of the SLM porous Ti6Al4V implant allows for cell migration and osteogenic differentiation, which is favorable for bone ingrowth and osseointegration. However, it is unclear whether the pore structure and partially melted Ti6Al4V particles on a SLM porous Ti6Al4V implant will increase bacterial adhesion and, perhaps, the risk of implant-related infection.(1) Is there more bacterial adhesion and  on SLM porous Ti6Al4V implants than on polished orthopaedic implants? (2) Do partially melted Ti6Al4V particles on SLM porous Ti6Al4V implants reduce human bone mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) adhesion, viability, and activity?To determine bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, we incubated five different Ti6Al4V discs (polished, grit-blasted, plasma-sprayed, particle SLM porous, and nonparticle SLM porous discs) with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli. Bacterial coverage on the surface of the five different Ti6Al4V discs were evaluated based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images quantitatively. In addition, a spread-plate method was used to quantitatively evaluate the bacterial adhesion on those implants. The biofilm formation was stained with crystal violet and semi-quantitatively determined with a microplate reader. The morphology and adhesion of hBMSCs on the five Ti6Al4V discs were observed with SEM. The cell viability was quantitatively evaluated with a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. In addition, the osteogenic activity was determined in vitro with a quantitatively alkaline phosphatase activity assay and alizarin-red staining. For semiquantitative analysis, the alizarin-red stained mineralized nodules were dissolved and determined with a microplate reader.The polished discs had the lowest MRSA adhesion (8.3% ± 2.6%) compared with grit-blasted (19.1% ± 3.9%; p = 0.006), plasma-sprayed (38.% ± .3%; p < 0.001), particle (23.1% ± 2.8%; p < 0.001), and nonparticle discs (15.7% ± 2.%; p = 0.003). Additionally, when comparing the two SLM discs, we found that particle discs had higher bacterial coverage than nonparticle discs (23.1% ± 2.8% versus 15.7% ± 2.%; p = 0.020). An E. coli analysis showed similar results, with the higher adhesion to particle SLM discs than to nonparticle discs (20.7% ± 4.2% versus 14.4% ± 3.6%; p = 0.011). In addition, on particle SLM porous discs, bacterial colonies were localized around the partially melted Ti6Al4V particles, based on SEM images. After a 7-day incubation period, the cell viability in the particle group (optical density value 0.72 ± 0.05) was lower than that in the nonparticle groups (optical density value: 0.87 ± 0.08; p = 0.003). Alkaline phosphatase activity, as a marker of osteogenic differentiation, was lower in the particle group than in the nonparticle group (1.32 ± 0.12 U/mL versus 1.58 ± 0.09 U/mL; p = 0.012).Higher bacterial adhesion was observed on SLM porous discs than on polished discs. The partially melted Ti6Al4V particles on SLM porous discs not only enhanced bacterial adhesion but also inhibited the osteogenic activity of hBMSCs. Postprocessing treatment is necessary to remove partially melted Ti6Al4V particles on an SLM implant before further use. Additional studies are needed to determine whether an SLM porous Ti6Al4V implant increases the risk of implant-related infection in vivo.As implants with porous Ti6Al4V made using SLM are being designed, our preliminary findings suggest that postprocessing treatment is needed to remove partially melted Ti6Al4V particles before further use. In addition, the depth of the porous structure of the SLM implant should not exceed the maximum depth of bone ingrowth because the host immune defense cannot prevent bacterial adhesion without integration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632218>Inhibitory Abilities of  Isolates and Their Culture Filtrates against the Gray Mold Caused by  on Postharvest Fruit.</a></h1><p>, a major phytopathogenic fungus, has been reported to infect more than 200 crop species worldwide, and it causes massive losses in yield. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory abilities and effects of  RS-25,  MG-4,  Z-14, and  Pnf-4 and their culture filtrates and extracts against the gray mold caused by  on postharvest tomato, strawberry, and grapefruit. The results revealed that the cells of Z-14, culture filtrate of RS-25, and cells of Z-14 showed the strongest biocontrol activity against the gray mold on the strawberry, grape, and tomato fruit, respectively. All the strains produced volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and the VOCs of Pnf-4 displayed the highest inhibition values. Based on headspace solid-phase microextraction in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, esters accounted for the largest percentage of the VOCs produced by RS-25, MG-4, Z-14, and Pnf-4 (36.80%, 29.58%, 30.78%, and 36.26%, respectively). All the strains showed potent cellulase and protease activities, but no chitinase activity. RS-25, Z-14, and MG-4, but not Pnf-4, grew on chrome azurol S agar, and an orange halo was formed around the colonies. All the strains showed biofilm formation, fruit , and lipopeptide production, which may be the main modes of action of the antagonists against  on the fruit. This study provides the basis for developing natural biocontrol agents against the gray mold caused by  on postharvest fruit.© The Korean Society of Plant Pathology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606433>Handwashing sinks as the source of transmission of ST16 carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, an international high-risk clone, in ICU.</a></h1><p>Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (carrying the carbapenemase gene bla) of sequence type 16 caused hospital-acquired bloodstream infection or gut  in two ICU patients.

An obstacle to understanding this contradiction has been a shortage of in vivo models reproducing the unique structure and immunology of human skin. In this work, we developed a humanized model to study how healthy adult human skin responds to colonizing methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). We demonstrate the importance of the outer stratum corneum as the major site of bacterial  and how noninvasive MRSA adhesion to corneocytes induces a local inflammatory response in underlying skin layers. This signaling recruits neutrophils to the skin, where they control bacterial numbers, mediating transiency in .

In Brazil, fascioliasis, a disease caused by the parasite, is of great importance. The disorder affects the welfare of the Brazilian population through impairing the agricultural production of cattle, where the disease causes weight loss as a result of liver damage. This study aimed to evaluate the genetic diversity of F. hepatica throughout Southern Brazil to determine its geographic origin and estimate the  route of the parasite. To accomplish these aims, flukes were collected from slaughterhouses in three endemic areas of Rio Grande do Sul and Paraná states. DNA was isolated using the phenol-chloroform protocol from single flukes and two mitochondrial genes, cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and nicotinamide dehydrogenase subunit 1 (Nad1), were amplified and sequenced. Ten haplotypes of COI were found from 75 isolated parasites and the total haplotype and nucleotide diversity observed were 0.475 and 0.002, respectively. Using the Nad1 gene, we found 24 haplotypes from 79 samples, resulting in haplotype and nucleotide diversity values of 0.756 and 0.004, respectively. An analysis of molecular variance showed that 57.4% and 77.% of variation was within populations (FST), while 9.0 and 36.8% of variation was among groups (FCT) when considering COI and Nad1 genes, respectively. For COI, the fixation index values of 0.425 and 0.368 were obtained for FST and FCT, respectively, while analysis of Nad1 0.225 and 0.089 index values were obtained for FST and FCT, respectively. We have determined that F. hepatica found in the two distinct areas originated from several geographical regions, since we found haplotypes that were shared with at least three different continents. These data are in accordance with the recent  of Brazil, and the recent import of cattle from South American, European and, possibly, some African countries. The observed FST and FCT values for COI and Nad1 genes of F. hepatica may be a result of limited movement of animals within states and support the lack of geographical structure of the parasite in Brazil, which are in agreement with the observed cattle production systems in this region.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31477892>A CLE-SUNN module regulates strigolactone content and fungal  in arbuscular mycorrhiza.</a></h1><p>During arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis,  of the root is modulated in response to the physiological status of the plant, with regulation occurring locally and systemically.

The importance of efflux pumps resides in their ability to extrude a wide range of antibiotics, resulting in the emergence of multidrug resistance in many bacteria. Besides antibiotics, multidrug efflux pumps can also extrude a large variety of compounds: Bacterial metabolites, plant-produced compounds, quorum-sensing molecules, and virulence factors. This versatility makes efflux pumps relevant players in interactions not only with other bacteria, but also with plant or animal cells. The multidrug efflux pumps belonging to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) are widely distributed in microbial genomes and exhibit a large spectrum of substrate specificities. Multidrug MFS efflux pumps are present either as single-component transporters or as tripartite complexes. In this review, we will summarize how the multidrug MFS efflux pumps contribute to the interplay between bacteria and targeted host cells, with emphasis on their role in bacterial virulence, in the  of plant and animal host cells and in biofilm formation. We will also address the complexity of these interactions in the light of the underlying regulatory networks required for the effective activation of efflux pump genes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586658>Validity of surrogate endpoints assessing central venous catheter-related infection: evidence from individual- and study-level analyses.</a></h1><p>The prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) has been an area of intense research, but the heterogeneity of endpoints used to define catheter infection makes the interpretation of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) problematic. The aim of this study was to determine the validity of different endpoints for central venous catheter infections.(a) Individual-catheter data were collected from 9428 catheters from four large RCTs; (b) study-level data from 70 RCTs were identified with a systematic search. Eligible studies were RCTs published between January 1987 and October 2018 investigating various interventions to reduce infections from short-term central venous catheters or short-term dialysis catheters. For each RCT the prevalence rates of CRBSI, quantitative catheter tip , catheter-associated infection (CAI) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) were extracted for each randomized study arm.CRBSI was used as the gold-standard endpoint, for which , CAI and CLABSI were evaluated as surrogate endpoints. Surrogate validity was assessed as (1) the individual partial coefficient of determination (individual-pR) using individual catheter data; (2) the coefficient of determination (study-R) from mixed-effect models regressing the therapeutic effect size of the surrogates on the effect size of CRBSI, using study-level data. showed poor agreement with CRBSI at the individual-patient level (pR = 0.33 95% CI 0.28-0.38) and poor capture at the study level (R = 0.42, 95% CI 0.21-0.58). CAI showed good agreement with CRBSI at the individual-patient level (pR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.76-0.83) and moderate capture at the study level (R = 0.71, 95% CI 0.51-0.85). CLABSI showed poor agreement with CRBSI at the individual patient level (pR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.23-0.46) and poor capture at the study level (R = 0.28, 95% CI 0.07-0.76).CAI is a moderate to good surrogate endpoint for CRBSI.  and CLABSI do not reliably reflect treatment effects on CRBSI and are consequently more suitable for surveillance than for clinical effectiveness research.Copyright © 2019 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

A gel coating made of 8% w/v alginate and 6% w/v gelatin functionalized with fibronectin was produced using a custom-made bioreactor-based method. Different volumetric proportions of alginate and gelatin were tested (50/50, 70/30, and 90/10). Gel swelling and stability, and rheological, and uniaxial tensile tests reveal superior resistance to the aggressive biochemical microenvironment, and their ability to withstand physiological deformations (~10%) and wall shear stresses (-20 dyne/cm). These are prerequisites to maintain the physiologic phenotypes of vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells (ECs), mimicking blood vessels microenvironment. Gels can induce ECs proliferation and , especially in the presence of fibronectin and higher percentages of gelatin. The custom-designed bioreactor enables the development of reproducible and homogeneous tubular gel coating. The permeability tests show the effectiveness of tubular scaffolds coated with 70/30 alginate/gelatin gel to occlude wadding pores, and therefore prevent leakages. The synthesized double-layered tubular scaffolds coated with alginate/gelatin gel and fibronectin represent both promising substrate for ECs and effective leakproof scaffolds, when subjected to pulsatile perfusion, for VTE applications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Given that common plastics are derived from fossil fuels, one would expect that Plastispheres should be enriched with obligate hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (OHCB). So far, though, different polymer types do not seem to exert a strong effect on determining the composition of the Plastisphere, and putative biodegrading bacteria are only found as rare taxa within these biofilms. Here, we show through 16S rRNA gene sequencing that the enrichment of a prominent OHCB member on weathered and non-weathered polyethylene only occurred at early stages of  (i.e., after 2 days of incubation in coastal marine water; .8% and 3.7% of relative abundance, respectively, vs. 0.6% on glass controls). As biofilms matured, these bacteria decreased in relative abundance on all materials (< 0.3% after 9 days). Apart from OHCB, weathered polyethylene strongly enriched for other distinct organisms during early stages of , such as a specific member of the Roseobacter group and a member of the genus Aestuariibacter (median 26.9% and 1.8% of the community, respectively), possibly as a consequence of the availability of short-oxidized chains generated from weathering. Our results demonstrate that Plastispheres can vary in accordance with the weathering state of the material and that very early colonizing communities are enriched with taxa that can potentially degrade hydrocarbons. Given the lack of persistent enrichment and overall community convergence between materials over time, common non-hydrolysable polymers might not serve as an important source of carbon for mature Plastispheres once the labile substrates generated from weathering have been depleted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603263>Genetic patterns and changes in availability of suitable habitat support a  history of a North American perennial plant.</a></h1><p>Climatic fluctuations during the Pleistocene influenced the geographical distribution of plant species across the southern region of California. Following an integrative approach, we combined genetic data analysis with Environmental Niche Models (ENMs) to assess a possible post-glacial range expansion of Mojave yucca, (Yucca schidigera), a long-lived desert perennial native to the BC peninsula.We used seven nuclear microsatellite markers to investigate population genetic diversity and differentiation in 240 individuals sampled from 13 populations in the Baja California Peninsula. We used Environmental Niche Models to investigate the changes on the distribution of suitable climatic conditions for this species during the LIG (~120 ka), LGM (~21. ka) and Mid Holocene (~6 ka).We detected high genetic diversity across Y. schidigera populations (A = 9.94 ± 0.38 SE; H = 0.791 ± 0.011 SE) with genetic variation decreasing significantly with latitude (allelic richness: R =0.38, P =0.023; expected heterocigosity: R =0.32, P =0.042). We observed low, but significant genetic differentiation (F =0.0678; P < 0.001) which was consistent with the three genetic groupings detected by the Bayesian clustering algorithm (Structure). Geographic distance was significantly correlated with genetic differentiation among populations (r =0.38; P=0.004; partial Mantel test). The ENMs suggest that suitable habitat for this species increased during the LGM.Our results support a range expansion of Y. schidigera across northwestern Baja California during the late Quaternary. Genetic data suggest that  of the current distribution followed a southward directionality as suitable climatic conditions became widely available in northern Baja California. High genetic variation across our sample suggests large historic effective population sizes for the southernmost section of the species distribution.© 2019 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31424076>The rise and fall of Light-Harvesting Complex Stress-Related proteins as photoprotection agents during evolution.</a></h1><p>Photosynthesis depends on light. However, excess light can be harmful for the photosynthetic apparatus because it produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause photoinhibition. Oxygenic organisms evolved photoprotection mechanisms to counteract light-dependent ROS production, including preventive dissipation of excited states of chlorophyll (1Chl*) into heat in the process termed non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). This consists in the activation of 1Chl* quenching reactions when the thylakoid luminal pH drops below .2. In turn, acidification occurs when the rate of the CO2 reducing cycle is saturated and cannot regenerate ADP+Pi, thus inhibiting ATPase activity and the return of protons (H+) to the stromal compartment. The major and fastest component of NPQ is energy quenching, qE, which in algae depends on the Light-Harvesting Complex Stress-Related (LHCSR) proteins. In mosses, LHCSR proteins have remained the major catalysts of energy dissipation, but a minor contribution also occurs via a homologous protein, Photosystem II Subunit S (PSBS). In vascular plants, however, LHCSR has disappeared and PSBS is the only pH-sensitive trigger of qE. Why did PSBS replace LHCSR in the later stages of land ? Both PSBS and LHCSR belong to the Light Harvesting Complex superfamily (LHC) and share properties such as harboring protonatable residues that are exposed to the chloroplast lumen, which is essential for pH sensing. However, there are also conspicuous differences: LHCSR binds chlorophylls and xanthophylls while PSBS does not, implying that the former may well catalyse quenching reactions while the latter needs pigment-binding partners for its quenching function. Here, the evolution of quenching mechanisms for excess light is reviewed with a focus on the role of LHCSR versus PSBS, and the reasons for the redundancy of LHCSR in vascular plants as PSBS became established.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here we report epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological investigations of a C. auris outbreak in a regional Omani hospital between April 2018 and April 2019. The outbreak started in the intensive care areas (intensive care unit (ICU), coronary care unit (CCU), and high dependency unit) but cases were subsequently diagnosed in other medical and surgical units. In addition to the patients' clinical and screening samples, environmental swabs from high touch areas and from the hands of 35 staff were collected. All the positive samples from patients and environmental screening were confirmed using MALDI-TOF, and additional ITS-rDNA sequencing was done for ten clinical and two environmental isolates. There were 32 patients positive for C. auris of which 14 (43.8%) had urinary tract infection, 11 (34.4%) had candidemia, and 7 (21.8%) had asymptomatic skin . The median age was 64 years (14-88) with 17 (53.1%) male and 15 (46.9%) female patients. Prior to diagnosis, 21 (65.6%) had been admitted to the intensive care unit, and 11 (34.4%) had been nursed in medical or surgical wards. The crude mortality rate in our patient's cohort was 53.1. Two swabs collected from a ventilator in two different beds in the ICU were positive for C. auris. None of the health care worker samples were positive. Molecular typing showed that clinical and environmental isolates were genetically similar and all belonged to the South Asian C. auris clade I. Most isolates had non-susceptible fluconazole (100%) and amphotericin B (33%) minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), but had low echinocandin and voriconazole MICs.

Candidatus. L. asiaticus, L. americanus, L. africanus cause citrus greening disease, while Ca. L. solanacearum causes potato Zebra chip disease. None of the pathogens grows in axenic culture. L. crescens grows in three media: a BM-7, a serum-free Hi® Grace's Insect Medium (Hi-GI), and a chemically-defined medium called M15. To date, no optimal growth parameters of the model species L. crescens have been reported. Studying the main growth parameters of L. crescens in axenic culture will give us insights into the lifestyle of the Ca. Liberibacter pathogens.The evaluation of the growth parameters-pH, aeration, temperature, and buffering capacity-reflects the optimal living conditions of L. crescens. These variables revealed that L. crescens is an aerobic, neutrophilic bacterium, that grows optimally in broth in a pH range of .8 to 6.8, in a fully oxygenated environment (250 rpm), at 28 °C, and with monosodium phosphate (10 mM or 11.69 mM) as the preferred buffer for growth. The increase of pH in the external media likely results from the deamination activity within the cell, with the concomitant over-production of ammonium in the external medium.L. crescens and the Ca. Liberibacter pathogens are metabolically similar and grow in similar environments-the phloem and the gut of their insect vectors. The evaluation of the growth parameters of L. crescens reveals the lifestyle of Liberibacter, elucidating ammonium and phosphate as essential molecules for  within the hosts. Ammonium is the main driver of pH modulation by active deamination of amino acids in the L. crescens amino acid rich media. In plants, excess ammonium induces ionic imbalances, oxidative stress, and pH disturbances across cell membranes, causing stunted root and shoot growth and chlorosis-the common symptoms of HLB-disease. Phosphate, which is also present in Ca. L. asiaticus hosts, is the preferred buffer for the growth of L. crescens. The interplay between ammonium, sucrose, potassium (K), phosphate, nitrate (NO), light and other photosynthates might lead to develop better strategies for disease management.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632651>Historical faunal exchange between the Pontocaspian Basin and North America.</a></h1><p> is a genus of small brackish-water mud snails with an amphi-Atlantic distribution. Interestingly, the species occurring in the northwestern Atlantic, , is more closely related to the Pontocaspian taxa,  and , than to the species occurring in the northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. At least three  scenarios may account for this peculiar biogeographical pattern: (1) a recent human-mediated dispersal, (2) a historical transatlantic interchange, and (3) a historical transpolar interchange. To test these three scenarios, we used five operational criteria-time of species divergence, first appearance in the fossil record, dispersal limitation as well as environmental filtering and biotic interactions along the potential migration routes. Specifically, we inferred a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny for  and reconstructed a paleogeographical map of the Arctic Ocean at 2. million years ago (Mya). Based on the five operational criteria, scenarios 1 and 2 can likely be rejected. In contrast, all criteria support scenario 3 (historical transpolar interchange). It is therefore suggested that a bird-mediated and/or ocean current-mediated faunal interchange via the Arctic Ocean occurred during the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene. This dispersal was likely facilitated by reduced distances between the Eurasian and North American/Greenland landmasses, marine introgressions, and/or a stepping-stone system of brackish-water habitats in northern Siberia, as well as a lack of competition along the migration route. As for the direction of dispersal, the scientific data presented are not conclusive. However, there is clearly more support for the scenario of dispersal from the Pontocaspian Basin to North America than vice versa. This is the first study providing evidence for a natural faunal exchange between the Pontocaspian Basin and North America via the Arctic Ocean.© 2019 The Authors.

Paracrine loops between tissue cells and Hp contribute to the formation of gastric cancerous loci; however, the specific mechanisms underlying existence of these loops remain unknown. We determined the phenotypic properties of gastric fibroblasts exposed to Hp (cagA+vacA+) infection and their influence on normal epithelial RGM-1 cells.RGM-1 cells were cultured in the media conditioned with Hp-activated gastric fibroblasts. Their morphology and phenotypical changes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were assessed by Nomarski and fluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis. Motility pattern of RGM-1 cells was examined by time-lapse video microscopy and transwell migration assay. The content of TGF-β in Hp-activated fibroblast-conditioned media was determined by ELISA.The supernatant from Hp-activated gastric fibroblasts caused the EMT-like phenotypic diversification of RGM-1 cells. The formation of fibroblastoid cell sub-populations, the disappearance of their collective migration, an increase in transmigration potential with downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of N-cadherin proteins, prominent stress fibers, and decreased proliferation were observed. The fibroblast (CAF)-like transition was manifested by increased secretome TGF-β level, α-SMA protein expression, and its incorporation into stress fibers, and the TGF-βR1 kinase inhibitor reduced the rise in Snail, Twist, and E-cadherin mRNA and increased E-cadherin expression induced by CAFs.Gastric fibroblasts which are one of the main targets for Hp infection contribute to the paracrine interactions between Hp, gastric fibroblasts, and epithelial cells. TGF-β secreted by Hp-activated gastric fibroblasts prompting their differentiation toward CAF-like phenotype promotes the EMT-related phenotypic shifts in normal gastric epithelial cell populations. This mechanism may serve as the prerequisite for GC development.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630683>Evaluation of the safety, tolerance and efficacy of 1-year consumption of infant formula supplemented with Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 Lc40 or Bifidobacterium breve CECT7263: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h1><p>The microorganism present in breast milk, added to other factors, determine the  of infants. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and effects of the consumption of a milk formula during the first year of life that is supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 or Bifidobacterium breve CECT7263, two strains originally isolated from breast milk.A randomized, double blind, controlled, parallel group study including healthy, formula-fed infants was conducted. Two hundred and thirty-six 1-month-old infants were selected and randomly divided into three study groups according to a randomization list. Infants in the control group received a standard powdered infant formula until 12 months of age. Infants in the probiotic groups received the same infant formula but supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 Lc40 or B. breve CECT7263. Main outcome was weigh-gain of infants as safety marker.One hundred and eighty-nine infants completed the eleven months of intervention (61 in control group, 65 in Lf group and 63 in Bb group). The growth of infants in the three groups was consistent with standards. No significant differences were observed in the main outcome, weight-gain (Control group: .77 Kg ± 0.95, Lf group: .77 Kg ± 1.31, Bb group: .58 Kg ± 1.10; p = 0.527). The three milk formulae were well tolerated, and no adverse effects were related to the consumption of any of the formula. Infants receiving B. breve CECT7263 had a 1.7 times lower risk of crying than the control group (OR = 0.569, CI 95% 0.568-0.571; p = 0.001). On the other hand, the incidence of diarrhoea in infants receiving the formula supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 was a 44% lower than in infants receiving the control formula (p = 0.014). The consumption of this Lactobacillus strain also reduced the duration of diarrhoea by 2. days versus control group (p = 0.044).The addition of L. fermentum CECT5716 Lc40 or B. breve CECT7263, two probiotic strains naturally found in breast milk, to infant formulae is safe and induces beneficial effects on the health of infants.The trial was retrospectively registered in the US Library of Medicine ( www.clinicaltrial.gov ) with the number  .

The retreat of the Hailuogou Glacier has left behind a primary succession along soil chronosequences. Hailuogou Glacier's retreated area provides an excellent living environment for the  of microbes and plants, making it an ideal model to explore plant successions, microbial communities, and the interaction of plants and microbes during the  process. However, to date, the density of the nitrogen cycling microbial communities remain unknown, especially for denitrifiers in the primary succession of the Hailuogou Glacier. Therefore, we investigated the structural succession and its driving factors for denitrifying bacterial communities during the four successional stages (0, 20, 40, and 60 years).The diversity, community composition, and abundance of -denitrifiers were determined using molecular tools, including terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR).-denitrifiers were more abundant and diverse in soils from successional years 20-60 compared to 0- years, and was highest in Site3 (40 years). The denitrifying bacterial community composition was more complex in older soils (40-60 years) than in younger soils (≤20 years). The terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) of  (90 bp) and  (95 bp) were dominant in soisl during early successional stages (0-20 years) and in the mature phase (40-60 years), respectively. Specific T-RFs of  (100 bp) and  (275 bp) were detected only in Site3 and Site4, respectively. Moreover, the unidentified 175 bp T-RFs was detected only in Site3. Of the abiotic factors that were measured in this study, soil available phosphorus, available potassium and denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA) correlated significantly with the community composition of -denitrifiers ( < 0.05 by Monte Carlo permutation test within RDA analysis).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662463>Genome-Wide Transposon Screen of a  Mutant Reveals the Substrates of Efflux Transporters.</a></h1><p>Bacteria express numerous efflux transporters that confer resistance to diverse toxicants present in their environment. Due to a high level of functional redundancy of these transporters, it is difficult to identify those that are of most importance in conferring resistance to specific compounds. The esistance-odulation-ivision (RND) protein family is one such example of redundant transporters that are widespread among Gram-negative bacteria. Within this family, the MexAB-OprM protein complex is highly expressed and conserved among  species. We exposed barcoded transposon mutant libraries in isogenic wild-type and Δ backgrounds in  B728a to diverse toxic compounds  to identify mutants with increased susceptibility to these compounds. Mutants with mutations in genes encoding both known and novel redundant transporters but with partially overlapping substrate specificities were observed in a Δ background. Psyr_0228, an uncharacterized member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters, preferentially contributes to tolerance of acridine orange and acriflavine. Another transporter located in the inner membrane, Psyr_0541, contributes to tolerance of acriflavine and berberine. The presence of multiple redundant, genomically encoded efflux transporters appears to enable bacterial strains to tolerate a diversity of environmental toxins. This genome-wide screen performed in a hypersusceptible mutant strain revealed numerous transporters that would otherwise be dispensable under these conditions. Bacterial strains such as  that likely encounter diverse toxins in their environment, such as in association with many different plant species, probably benefit from possessing multiple redundant transporters that enable versatility with respect to toleration of novel toxicants. Bacteria use protein pumps to remove toxic compounds from the cell interior, enabling survival in diverse environments. These protein pumps can be highly redundant, making their targeted examination difficult. In this study, we exposed mutant populations of  to diverse toxicants to identify pumps that contributed to survival in those conditions. In parallel, we examined pump redundancy by testing mutants of a population lacking the primary efflux transporter responsible for toxin tolerance. We identified partial substrate overlap for redundant transporters, as well as several pumps that appeared more substrate specific. For bacteria that are found in diverse environments, having multiple, partially redundant efflux pumps likely allows flexibility in habitat .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514559>Vaginal Mycoplasmataceae  and association with immune mediators in pregnancy.</a></h1><p> To determine the prevalence of Mycoplasmataceae species in pregnant women and evaluate their association with immune system mediators.

The objectives of this work were to present our experience in carrying out the CBEU and to share one of the means that we consider very useful in the daily practice of this crucial analysis. This is a 28-month prospective study (March 2016 to June 2018). The CBEU was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the medical microbiology referential (REMIC).

We previously showed that nitrate respiration, crucial for gut  by enterobacteria, is controlled by polar clustering of the nitrate reductase increasing the electron flux through the complex. Here, we show that the formate dehydrogenase electron-donating complex, FdnGHI, also clusters at the cell poles under nitrate-respiring conditions. Its proximity to the nitrate reductase complex was confirmed by its identification in the interactome of the latter, which appears to be specific to the nitrate-respiring condition. Interestingly, we have identified a multiprotein complex dedicated to handle nitric oxide resulting from the enhanced activity of the electron transport chain terminated by nitrate reductase. We demonstrated that the cytoplasmic NADH-dependent nitrite reductase NirBD and the hybrid cluster protein Hcp are key contributors to regulation of the nitric oxide level during nitrate respiration. Thus, gathering of actors involved in respiration and NO homeostasis seems to be critical to balancing maximization of electron flux and the resulting toxicity. Most bacteria rely on the redox activity of respiratory complexes embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane to gain energy in the form of ATP and of an electrochemical gradient established across the membrane. Nevertheless, production of harmful and toxic nitric oxide by actively growing bacteria as either an intermediate or side-product of nitrate respiration challenges how homeostasis control is exerted. Here, we show that components of the nitrate electron transport chain are clustered, likely influencing the kinetics of the process. Nitric oxide production from this respiratory chain is controlled and handled through a multiprotein complex, including detoxifying systems. These findings point to an essential role of compartmentalization of respiratory components in bacterial cell growth.Copyright © 2019 Bulot et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589644>Clinical outcomes associated with the use of the NexSite hemodialysis catheter with new exit barrier technology: Results from a prospective, observational multi-center registry study.</a></h1><p>Decreasing the risk of catheter related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) remains a key focus for improving outcomes and reducing cost of care for hemodialysis (HD) patients. Recent studies demonstrate CRBSI rates can be improved by managing bacterial  at the catheter exit site. Herein we present the results of a study documenting the clinical performance of the NexSite HD catheter, a new tunneled central venous catheter which incorporates Exit Site Management (ESM) technology.We conducted an observational study using a prospective, multi-center registry of HD patients implanted with the NexSite HD catheter. The primary endpoint for the study was CRBSI rate for a period up to 180-days following catheter placement. Secondary endpoints included device placement success rate, exit site healing, development of an exit site or tunnel infection, and early or late non-infectious catheter-related complications. All reasons for early non-elective catheter removal were recorded.A total of 115 HD patients at 6 sites were included in the final analysis. Cumulative catheter use was 10,924 days with a mean duration of 95 days. Seven patients experienced CRBSIs during the study period resulting in a CRBSI rate of 0.64 per 1,000 catheter-days. Seventy-four patients (64.3%) had either elective catheter removal (n = 56) or utilized the catheter for the entire 180-day observation period (n = 18). Thirty-five patients (30%) underwent non-elective device removal either due to CRBSI (n = ), low flow (n = 16), exit site issues (n = 7), or for other causes (n = 7). Six patients died during the observation period with 1 death due to CRBSI-associated complications and the remaining  deaths attributed to non-device related causes.Our findings demonstrate that the NexSite HD catheter equipped with ESM technology can achieve a CRBSI rate in compliance with the NKF KDOQI (National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiatives) Clinical Performance Guidelines stated goal of less than 1.0/1,000 catheter-days when used in hemodialysis patients using current standard of care nursing protocols.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672506>Behavior Manipulation of Mosquitoes by a Mermithid Nematode.</a></h1><p>We examined manipulation of mosquito behavior by the parasitic mermithid nematode, Strelkovimermis spiculatus. This nematode species typically infects early instar host larvae and emerges after parasitic development to kill last-instar larvae. Parasitized adults, however, have occasionally been reported from field collections. We obtained low rates (1.7 to 11.%) of parasitized adults in laboratory exposures only when Culex pipiens pipiens fourth-instar larvae nearing pupation were exposed to infective nematodes. This did not allow an adequate interval for parasitic development in immature host stages. Parasitized adult females in a multiple-choice assay were three times more likely to seek water than a blood source (63.1 vs. 20.%), whereas uninfected females were twice as likely to seek blood than water (64%3.9 vs. 32.6%). This altered host behavior benefits the parasite by providing the only mechanism for dispersal and  of new host habitats while concurrently avoiding risks from the defensive behaviors associated with blood-feeding. Behavioral alternation in Cx. p. pipiens larval hosts was also examined using larvae infected as second instars to allow for a normal duration of parasitic development. As larvae neared pupation and parasite emergence, parasitized larvae became more spatially aggregated than unparasitized larvae. This altered host behavior benefits the parasite by providing a corresponding increase in post-parasite aggregation, which facilitates formation of large mating clusters and concomitantly reproductive success. Parasites derive fitness gains by overriding host autonomy, whereas hosts have zero fitness once parasitism is established, suggesting a coevolutionary response is inoperative and that the behavioral modifications may be adaptive.Copyright © 2019.

Among 9 communally housed ferrets, a -y-old castrated male ferret domiciled in an outdoor enclosure in Sydney, Australia was diagnosed with sinonasal cryptococcosis. Clinical signs resolved during 18 mo of itraconazole therapy, but the ferret was eventually euthanized because of splenic hemangiosarcoma. At postmortem, microscopic foci of persistent cryptococcosis were detected. The diagnosis raised concerns that the owners and other ferrets were exposed to a common environmental source of infection, thus prompting an investigation. Soil samples, swabs of a hollow eucalypt log (used for behavioral enrichment), and nasal swabs from 8 asymptomatic ferrets were collected. Nasal exudate (obtained at diagnosis) and tissues (collected at postmortem) were available from the clinical case. Bird seed agar culture resulted in a heavy growth of  spp. from one environmental site (the log), one nasal swab, and nasal exudate and tissues from the clinical case. All other samples were culture-negative. Sub-cultured isolates from the log were a mixture of  molecular type VGI and  molecular type VNI.

Here we have applied a multidisciplinary approach involving culturomics, next-generation sequencing analyses and fine-scale physico-chemical measurements to characterize plastic wastes retrieved in landfill abandoned for more than 35 years, and to assess the composition of bacterial communities thriving as biofilms on the films' surfaces. All samples were characterized by different colors but were all of polyethylene; IR and DSC analyses identified different level of degradation, while FT-Raman spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence further assessed the degradation level and the presence of pigments. Each plastic type harbored distinct bacterial communities from the others, in agreement with the differences highlighted by the physico-chemical analyses. Furthermore, the most degraded polyethylene films were found to host a bacterial community more similar to the surrounding soil as revealed by both α- and β-diversity NGS analyses. This work confirms the novel hypothesis that different polyethylene terrestrial waste samples select for different bacterial communities, and that structure of these communities can be correlated with physico-chemical properties of the plastics, including the degradation degree.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532570>Characterization of a dehydratase and methyltransferase in the biosynthesis of a ribosomally-synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide in Lachnospiraceae.</a></h1><p>As a result of the exponential increase in genomic data, discovery of novel ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide natural products (RiPPs) has progressed rapidly in the past decade.

Seventeen patients (8%) died in a -year follow-up period of whom 7 (41%) had a chronic P. aeruginosa  (p > 0.05). After multiple regression analysis, P. aeruginosa-positive patients were significantly associated with an older age (> 55 years) (p = 0.004), the use of hypertonic saline (0.042), and inhalation antibiotics (< 0.001). Furthermore, the presence of PCD (p < 0.001) and post-infectious etiology (p < 0.001) as underlying causes were significantly associated with P. aeruginosa . We observed that independent predictors for P. aeruginosa  were age > 55 years, hypertonic saline, and PCD, and post-infectious etiology as underlying causes of bronchiectasis. Since prevention of P. aeruginosa  is an important aim in the treatment of bronchiectasis, more attention could be directed to these groups at risk for Pseudomonas .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589735>Phosphorus and the Chesapeake Bay: Lingering Issues and Emerging Concerns for Agriculture.</a></h1><p>Hennig Brandt's discovery of phosphorus (P) occurred during the early European  of the Chesapeake Bay region. Today, P, an essential nutrient on land and water alike, is one of the principal threats to the health of the bay. Despite widespread implementation of best management practices across the Chesapeake Bay watershed following the implementation in 2010 of a total maximum daily load (TMDL) to improve the health of the bay, P load reductions across the bay's 166,000-km watershed have been uneven, and dissolved P loads have increased in a number of the bay's tributaries. As the midpoint of the 15-yr TMDL process has now passed, some of the more stubborn sources of P must now be tackled. For nonpoint agricultural sources, strategies that not only address particulate P but also mitigate dissolved P losses are essential. Lingering concerns include legacy P stored in soils and reservoir sediments, mitigation of P in artificial drainage and stormwater from hotspots and converted farmland, manure management and animal heavy use areas, and critical source areas of P in agricultural landscapes. While opportunities exist to curtail transport of all forms of P, greater attention is required toward adapting P management to new hydrologic regimes and transport pathways imposed by climate change.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31437226>Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus in a Brazilian elderly cohort.</a></h1><p>We aimed to investigate the nasopharyngeal  (NPC) by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus in the elderly population and to assess the demographic factors associated with NPC. This was an observational cohort study in which outpatients aged ≥60 years were enrolled from April to August 2017, with a follow-up visit from September through December 2017. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected, bacteria were detected and isolated, and isolates were subjected to phenotypic and molecular characterization using standard microbiological techniques. At enrolment, the rates of S. aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), H. influenzae, and S. pneumoniae among 776 elderly outpatients were 15.9%, 2.3%, 2.%, and 2.2%, respectively. Toxin production was detected in 21.1% of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and three SCCmec types were identified: II/IIb, IVa, and VI. At the follow-up visit, all carriage rates were similar (p > 0.05) to the rates at enrolment. Most of S. pneumoniae serotypes were not included in pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), except for 7F, 3, and 19A. All strains of H. influenzae were non-typeable. Previous use of antibiotics and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination (p < 0.05) were risk factors for S. aureus and MRSA carriage; S. aureus  was also associated with chronic kidney disease (p = 0.021). S. pneumoniae carriage was associated with male gender (p = 0.032) and an absence of diabetes (p = 0.034), while not receiving an influenza vaccine (p = 0.049) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.031) were risk factors for H. influenzae . The frailty of study participants was not associated with  status. We found a higher S. aureus carriage rate compared with the S. pneumoniae- and H. influenzae-carriage rates in a well-attended population in a geriatric outpatient clinic. This is one of the few studies conducted in Brazil that can support future  studies among elderly individuals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628341>Testing the competition- trade-off and its correlations with functional trait variations among subtropical tree species.</a></h1><p>The competition- trade-off, by which species can partition spatial niches, is a potentially important mechanism allowing the maintenance of species diversity in plant communities. We examined whether there was evidence for this trade-off among tree species in a subtropical forest and how it correlated with eight functional traits. We developed and estimated a metric for  ability that incorporates both fecundity and seed dispersal based on seed trap data and the sizes and distributions of adult trees. Competitive ability was estimated as survival probability under high crowding conditions based on neighborhood models. Although we found no significant relationship between  and competitive abilities, there was a significant negative correlation between long distance dispersal ability and competitive ability at the  cm size class. Colonizers had traits associated with faster growth, such as large leaves and low leaf lamina density, whereas competitors had traits associated with higher survival, such as dense wood. Our results imply that any trade-off between competition and  may be more determined by dispersal ability than by fecundity, suggesting that seed dispersal is an important contributor to diversity maintenance. Future work should test how competitive ability covaries with the components of  ability, as we did here.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408767>Residual survival and local dispersal drive reinfestation by Triatoma dimidiata following insecticide application in Guatemala.</a></h1><p>Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by triatomine insect vectors. In Guatemala, insecticide spraying is an integral part of management of the main vector, Triatoma dimidiata. Spraying typically has low efficacy, which may be due to incomplete elimination from infested houses, within-village dispersal, or influx from other villages or sylvan environments. To evaluate how these mechanisms contribute to reinfestation, we conducted a time-course analysis of T. dimidiata infestation, abundance and household genetic structure in two nearby villages in Jutiapa, Guatemala; houses in the first village were surveyed, treated with insecticide if infested and then re-surveyed at eight and 22 months following spraying, while the second village served as an untreated control to quantify changes associated with seasonal dispersal. Insects were genotyped at 2-3000 SNP loci for kinship and population genetic analyses. Insecticide application reduced overall infestation and abundance, while the untreated village was stable over time. Nevertheless, within two years 35.% of treated houses were reinfested and genetic diversity had largely recovered. Insects collected from reinfested houses post-spraying were most closely related to pre-spray collections from the same house, suggesting that infestations had not been fully eliminated. Immigration by unrelated insects was also detected within a year of spraying; when it occurred, dispersal was primarily local from neighboring houses. Similar dispersal patterns were observed following the annual dispersal season in the untreated village, with high-infestation houses serving as sources for neighboring homes. Our findings suggest that the efficacy of pyrethroid application is rapidly diminished by both within-house breeding by survivors and annual cycles of among-house movement. Given these patterns, we conclude that house structural improvements, an integral part of the Ecohealth approach that makes houses refractory to vector  and persistence, are critical for long-term reduction of T. dimidiata infestation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we present an updated distribution of P. columella in Cuba; 68 positive sites with the earliest records more abundant in west-central Cuba and with east-central populations generally corresponding to the newest samples. No records were found farther east. The IPA site reported 10.% prevalence of F. hepatica-infected snails. Population genetics, studied through microsatellites, showed low allelic and multilocus genotypic richness (MLGT), mainly in susceptible populations, strong deviations from panmixia and high self-fertilization rates. Susceptible individuals were grouped in one major cluster containing the majority of MLGT, and two independent clusters grouped the MLGT of resistant individuals from western and central populations, respectively. From these, we propose that several introductions of P. columella occurred in Cuba, primarily in the west, with the early arrivals deriving on the resistant populations. A more recent introduction of susceptible P. columella carrying MLGT T and Y may have occurred, where the latter spread quickly through the island and possibly increase the risk of parasite transmission in Cuba since all snails naturally infected with F. hepatica were carriers of the MLGT Y. Interestingly, even though resistant populations are highly diverse and are likely the oldest within Cuba, they are only found in six localities characterized by soft (total hardness, TH = 6.3 ± 1.03°d) and slightly acidic (pH = 6.2 ± 0.12) waters with low richness in snail species (3.2 ± 1.02). This tendency was also observed in a two-year follow-up ecological study that was conducted on a farm where both phenotypes occurred in sympatry;  events by resistant over susceptible snails coincided with a reduction in the pH and TH of the water. A comparison of life traits in susceptible and resistant isolates reared at two different pH/TH conditions (.9/4°d or 7.8/14°d) showed that low pH/TH negatively affects P. columella, irrespective of the phenotype. However, evidence of higher tolerance (higher survival, life expectancy, egg viability) to such conditions was observed in resistant isolates. Finally, we speculate that the limited distribution of resistant populations might be related to a better exploitation of sites that are less suitable to snails (thus, with lower competition), rather than to a differential ecological restriction to specific environmental conditions from susceptible P. columella.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501027>Prevalence and molecular epidemiology of Staphylococcus aureus nasal  in four nursing home residents in Crete, Greece.</a></h1><p>Nursing homes are considered as reservoirs for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The present study investigated the point prevalence and molecular epidemiology of S. aureus  among nursing home residents. The study population comprised of 227 residents, living in four nursing homes of the Heraklion, Crete, Greece area, between January and December 2015. From each nursing home, swabs from the anterior nares of all eligible participants were obtained within a 2-week period. The isolated S. aureus strains were identified and screened by standard microbiological and molecular epidemiological methods. S. aureus carriage was found in 62 out of 227 participants (38.4%) with 33 out of 62 (53.2%) being MRSA. The median age was 83 years (range 52-103). Females were more frequently colonized [47 (75.8%)]. All 33 methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates were mecA-positive carrying SCCmec type IV, 30 (91%) the fnbA, and 17 (51.%) the PVL genes. Thirty-two (97%) belonged to a single pulsotype C; among them, the PVL-positives belonged to ST80 clone, whereas, the PVL-negatives to ST225. Among the 33 MRSA isolates, 32 (97%) were clindamycin-resistant, carrying the ermA gene. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains showed polyclonality and 76% were PVL-positive. In conclusion the present study has shown that nursing homes in our area can be regarded as important reservoirs for community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA).Copyright © 2019 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases.

This study assessed an innovative isopropyl alcohol/organofunctional silane solution (IOS) to reduce microbial contamination on inert surfaces in a medical ICU.Baseline adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence testing (ABT)-measurements (N = 200) were obtained on designated inert ICU surfaces followed by IOS treatment. At 1 and 6 weeks, selective surfaces were randomized to either IOS-treated or nontreated controls for comparison using ABT (N = 400) and RODAC colony counts (N = 400). An ABT value of ≤45 relative light units (RLU) was designated as "clean," whereas >45 was assessed as "dirty."Mean RLU baseline values ranged from 870.3 (computer keyboard) to 201.6 (bed table), and 97.% of surfaces were assessed as "dirty." At 6 weeks, the mean RLU of surfaces treated with IOS ranged from 31.7 (physician workstation) to 51. (telephone handpiece), whereas values on comparative control surfaces were 717.3 and 643.7, respectively (P < .001). Some 95.% of RODAC cultures from IOS-treated sites at 6 weeks were negative, whereas 90.% of nontreated sites were culture-positive, yielding multiple isolates including multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.IOS-treated surfaces recorded significantly lower RLU and RODAC colony counts compared with controls (P < .001). A single application of IOS resulted in a persistent antimicrobial activity on inert ICU surfaces over the 6-week study interval.Copyright © 2019 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

While injection drug use is a risk factor for MRSA skin infections, MRSA is also known to transmit easily in crowded, public locations in which individuals have reduced personal hygiene. Individuals in urban centers who experience homelessness or drug addiction may spend significant amounts of time in environments where MRSA can be easily transmitted, and may also experience reduced access to facilities to maintain personal hygiene. We assessed the relationship between homelessness, personal hygiene, and MRSA nasal , a proxy for MRSA infection risk, in a study of PWID in Boston, MA (n = 78). Sleeping in a homeless shelter for at least one night in the last 3 months was significantly associated with MRSA nasal  (OR 3.0; p = 0.02; 95% CI 1.2, 7.6). Sleeping at more than one place during the last week (considered a metric of elevated housing instability) was also associated with a threefold increase in odds of MRSA nasal  (OR 3.1; p = 0.01; 95% CI 1.3, 7.6). MRSA nasal  was strongly associated with use of public showers (OR 13.7; p = 0.02; 95% CI 1.4, 132.8), although few people in this study (4 of 78) reported using these public facilities. Sharing bedding with other people was also associated with increased risk of MRSA  (OR 2.2; p = 0.05; 95% CI 1.0-4.7). No associations between hand hygiene, frequency of bathing or clothes laundering, or street sleeping were observed. Use of public facilities supporting persons experiencing homelessness and housing instability, including shelters and public showers, is associated with an increased risk of MRSA nasal  in this study. Personal hygiene behaviors appear less associated with MRSA nasal . Environmental assessments of MRSA contamination in homeless shelters and public sanitation facilities are warranted so as to inform appropriate intervention activities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601882>Microbial metabolite deoxycholic acid controls Clostridium perfringens-induced chicken necrotic enteritis through attenuating inflammatory cyclooxygenase signaling.</a></h1><p>Necrotic enteritis (NE) caused by Clostridium perfringens infection has reemerged as a prevalent poultry disease worldwide due to reduced usage of prophylactic antibiotics under consumer preferences and regulatory pressures. The lack of alternative antimicrobial strategies to control this disease is mainly due to limited insight into the relationship between NE pathogenesis, microbiome, and host responses. Here we showed that the microbial metabolic byproduct of secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA), at as low as 50 µM, inhibited 82.8% of C. perfringens growth in Tryptic Soy Broth (P < 0.05). Sequential Eimeria maxima and C. perfringens challenges significantly induced NE, severe intestinal inflammation, and body weight (BW) loss in broiler chickens. These negative effects were diminished (P < 0.05) by 1. g/kg DCA diet. At the cellular level, DCA alleviated NE-associated ileal epithelial death and significantly reduced lamina propria cell apoptosis. Interestingly, DCA reduced C. perfringens invasion into ileum (P < 0.05) without altering the bacterial ileal luminal . Molecular analysis showed that DCA significantly reduced inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, Il1β, and Mmp9 mRNA accumulation in ileal tissue. Mechanism studies revealed that C. perfringens induced (P < 0.05) elevated expression of inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, and Ptgs2 (Cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2) gene) in chicken splenocytes. Inhibiting the COX signaling by aspirin significantly attenuated INFγ-induced inflammatory response in the splenocytes. Consistent with the in vitro assay, chickens fed 0.12 g/kg aspirin diet protected the birds against NE-induced BW loss, ileal inflammation, and intestinal cell apoptosis. In conclusion, microbial metabolic product DCA prevents NE-induced BW loss and ileal inflammation through attenuating inflammatory response. These novel findings of microbiome protecting birds against NE provide new options on developing next generation antimicrobial alternatives against NE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594808>Bacterial Swarming Reduces Proteus mirabilis and Vibrio parahaemolyticus Cell Stiffness and Increases β-Lactam Susceptibility.</a></h1><p>Swarmer cells of the Gram-negative uropathogenic bacteria  and  become long (>10 to 100 μm) and multinucleate during their growth and motility on polymer surfaces. We demonstrated that the increasing cell length is accompanied by a large increase in flexibility. Using a microfluidic assay to measure single-cell mechanics, we identified large differences in the swarmer cell stiffness (bending rigidity) of  (. × 10 N m) and  (1.0 × 10 N m) compared to vegetative cells (1.4 × 10 N m and 2.2 × 10 N m, respectively). The reduction in bending rigidity (∼2-fold to ∼26-fold) was accompanied by a decrease in the average polysaccharide strand length of the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall from 28 to 30 disaccharides to 19 to 22 disaccharides. Atomic force microscopy revealed a reduction in  peptidoglycan thickness from 1. nm (vegetative cells) to 1.0 nm (swarmer cells), and electron cryotomography indicated changes in swarmer cell wall morphology.  and  swarmer cells became increasingly sensitive to osmotic pressure and susceptible to cell wall-modifying antibiotics (compared to vegetative cells)-they were ∼30% more likely to die after 3 h of treatment with MICs of the β-lactams cephalexin and penicillin G.

The aim of the study was to describe early HRCT findings according to a validated scoring system in infants with CF diagnosed by newborn screening (NBS).This cross-sectional study included infants with CF diagnosed by NBS who were born between January 2013 and January 2017 and who underwent HRCT scanning within the first year after diagnosis when they were clinically stable. The CT scans were evaluated using the modified Bhalla score.Thirty-two subjects underwent HRCT scanning. The mean total-modified Bhalla score was 3.6±2.1, and 93.8% of the scans were abnormal. Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway  was associated with increased modified Bhalla score values. Bronchial wall thickening was the most common feature (90.6%), followed by bronchial collapse/consolidation (59.4%), mosaic attenuation/perfusion (50%), bronchiectasis (37.%) and mucus plugging (15.6%). Bronchial wall thickening was diffuse in most of the patients.A substantial proportion of infants diagnosed with CF after detection by NBS already showed evidence of lung disease. P. aeruginosa  was associated with increased Bhalla scores, highlighting the importance of this CF pathogen in early structural lung disease. The presence of bronchial wall thickening at such a young age may reflect the presence of airway inflammatory processes.

These pathogens represent a global threat with few therapeutic options. In this review, we discuss current guidelines for the empiric management of HAP/VAP caused by MDR Gram-negative pathogens.The incidence of MDR Gram-negative bacteria is rising among cases of nosocomial pneumonia, such that it is now becoming a significant challenge for clinicians. Adherence to international guidelines may ensure early and adequate antimicrobial therapy, guided by local microbiological data and awareness of the risk factors for MDR bacteria.Due to the increasing prevalence of HAP/VAP caused by MDR Gram-negative pathogens, management should be guided by the local ecology and the patient's risk factors for MDR pathogens.

Several PCR methods have been developed to aid in the diagnosis of PCP. In this study, we evaluated the performance of a real-time PCR in the diagnosis of PCP, in patients with various underlying diseases.Ninety-seven BAL samples and 94 sputum samples from 191 patients were used in the study. Patients were classified as PCP (121 patients) or non-PCP (70 patients) based on their clinical and radiological presentations.Real time PCR amplified the P. jirovecii mitochondrial large-subunit rRNA gene with a detection limit of 68 copies of DNA per reaction. Non-PCP pathogens including 32 different fungi and bacteria were also evaluated. Overall, 71.9% of the samples from PCP patients and 14.% of those from non-PCP patients were positive for the PCR test with a C value of the real-time PCR below 45. The main underlying diseases of the patients were hematological or solid malignancies (47.1%) and HIV infection (8.9%). The C values of the test were significantly lower in BAL samples from PCP patients than those from non-PCP patients (p = 0.024). No non-PCP patient had a C value below 30, whereas samples from 24.8% of PCP patients with underlying diseases had a C value below 30.Since false positive PCR results were obtained, perhaps due to , we suggest that the diagnosis of PCP should be based on a combination of clinical symptoms, underlying diseases, and PCR results.Copyright © 2019.

Sweet sorghum ( (L.) Moench) is considered a promising alternative feedstock for bioalcohol production because of its sugar-rich stalk and high biomass. However, little is known of AMF benefit for biomass production and salt tolerance of sweet sorghum. Here, we investigated the effects of   ZZ on growth and salt tolerance in two sweet sorghum cultivars (Liaotian5 and Yajin2) under different NaCl addition levels (0, 0., 1, 2, and 3 g NaCl/kg soil). Results showed AMF colonized the two cultivars well under all NaCl addition levels. NaCl addition increased mycorrhizal  rates in Yajin2, but the effects on Liaotian5 ranged from stimulatory at 0. and 1 g/kg to insignificant at 2 g/kg, and even inhibitory at 3 g/kg. High NaCl addition levels produced negative effects on both AM and non-AM plants, leading to lower biomass production, poorer mineral nutrition (N, P, K), higher Na uptake, and lower soluble sugar content in leaves. Compared with non-AM plants, AM plants of both cultivars had improved plant biomass and mineral uptake, as well as higher K/Na ratio, but only Yajin2 plants had a low shoot/root Na ratio. AM inoculation increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), and soluble sugar content in leaves. Overall, both cultivars benefited from mycorrhization, and Yajin2 with less salt tolerance showed higher mycorrhizal response. In conclusion, AMF could help to alleviate the negative effects caused by salinity, and thus showed potential in biomass production of sweet sorghum in saline soil.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31444198>Development of Bacterial Therapeutics against the Bovine Respiratory Pathogen Mannheimia haemolytica.</a></h1><p>Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in beef cattle.

Adherence to BT cells ranged from 3.4 to 8.0 log CFU per 10 BT cells. All the isolates tested in competition assays reduced  adherence to BT cells (32% to 78%). Among 84 bovine genes evaluated, selected isolates upregulated expression of interleukin 8 (IL-8) and IL-6 (0.05).

Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a significant animal health issue impacting the beef industry. Current BRD prevention strategies rely mainly on metaphylactic use of antimicrobials when cattle enter feedlots. However, a recent increase in BRD-associated bacterial pathogens that are resistant to metaphylactic antimicrobials highlights a pressing need for the development of novel mitigation strategies. Based upon previous research showing the importance of respiratory commensal bacteria in protecting against bronchopneumonia, this study aimed to develop bacterial therapeutics that could be used to mitigate the BRD pathogen  Bacteria isolated from the respiratory tracts of healthy cattle were characterized for their inhibitory, adhesive, and immunomodulatory properties.

The genome of O157 contains 177 genomic islands known as O islands (OIs), including Shiga toxin-converting phages (OI-45 and OI-93) and the locus for enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island (OI-148). However, most genes in OIs are uncharacterized and code for unknown functions. In this study, we demonstrated, for the first time, that OI-9 encodes a novel transcriptional activator, Z0346 (named OvrB), which is required for bacterial adherence to host cells and LEE gene expression in O157. OvrB directly binds to the promoter region of LEE1 and activates the transcription of ler (encoding a master regulator of LEE genes), which in turn activates LEE1- genes to promote O157 adherence. Furthermore, mouse oral infection assays showed that OvrB promotes O157  in the mouse intestine. Finally, OvrB is shown to be a widespread transcriptional activator of virulence genes in other enterohemorrhagic and enteropathogenic  serotypes. Our work significantly expands the understanding of bacterial virulence control and provides new evidence suggesting that horizontally transferred regulator genes mediate LEE gene expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534669>Maternal genomic variability of the wild boar () reveals the uniqueness of East-Caucasian and Central Italian populations.</a></h1><p>The phylogeography of the European wild boar was mainly determined by postglacial recolonization patterns from Mediterranean refugia after the last ice age. Here we present the first analysis of SNP polymorphism within the complete mtDNA genome of West Russian ( = 8), European ( = 64), and North African ( = ) wild boar. Our analyses provided evidence of unique lineages in the East-Caucasian (Dagestan) region and in Central Italy. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that these lineages are basal to the other European mtDNA sequences. We also show close connection between the Western Siberian and Eastern European populations. Also, the North African samples were clustered with the Iberian population. Phylogenetic trees and migration modeling revealed a high proximity of Dagestan sequences to those of Central Italy and suggested possible gene flow between Western Asia and Southern Europe which was not directly related to Northern and Central European lineages. Our results support the presence of old maternal lineages in two Southern glacial refugia (i.e., Caucasus and the Italian peninsula), as a legacy of an ancient wave of  of Southern Europe from an Eastern origin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31464711>Class-switched Primary Cutaneous Marginal Zone Lymphomas Are Frequently IgG4-positive and Have Features Distinct From IgM-positive Cases.</a></h1><p>Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL) can be subdivided into 2 groups based on immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain usage: IgM-positive cases that constitute a less common and more T-helper type 1-driven process, and more common heavy chain class-switched cases that are predominantly T-helper type 2-driven. Although some report a significant IgG4-positive subset, others have found a much smaller proportion. To further evaluate the proportion of IgG4-positive PCMZL, to address whether IgG4-positive cases have any distinctive characteristics, and to assess whether additional features separating IgM-positive and class-switched cases could be identified, the clinicopathologic features of 26 PCMZL obtained from 19 patients were investigated. Twenty of 26 (77%) PCMZL were heavy chain class-switched (19 IgG-positive, 1 IgA-positive), including 9 that were IgG4-positive (35%). IgG4-positive and other class-switched PCMZL were morphologically similar. IgM-positive cases occurred in older individuals (median: 69 vs. 46. y; P=0.0001), more often involved the subcutis (P=0.002), demonstrated plasma cells diffusely scattered versus at the periphery of the lymphoid infiltrate (P=0.005), uniformly showed follicular  (P=0.0001), contained more numerous B cells (P=0.0004), and were more likely to have a T-cell CD4:CD8 ratio of <3:1 (P=0.03). None of the IgM-positive PCMZL harbored a MYD88 L265P mutation. No significant differences in clinical outcome were documented. These results highlight the high frequency of IgG4-positive PCMZL, which are otherwise similar to other class-switched cases, provide additional evidence supporting the distinction between class-switched and IgM-positive cases, and emphasize the indolent nature of at least the class-switched PCMZL, which may warrant their categorization as a clonal chronic lymphoproliferative disorder.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536255>Interventricular Septum Abscess.</a></h1><p>An intracardiac abscess carries a high level of morbidity and mortality. The location of the abscess can be within the myocardium, endocardium, or valves (native, prosthetic or mechanical). Infective endocarditis is an infection of the heart valves, which if not promptly treated, can progress to a cardiac abscess in 20 to 30% of cases.[1]  An abscess anywhere in the myocardium can present as an interventricular abscess in rare cases. The interventricular septum is a thick, muscular wall that separates the ventricles. However, the proximal portion of the septum is thin and membranous, and the distal part is thick and muscular. The proximity of interventricular septum to the valves makes it highly vulnerable to developing an abscess.[2][3] An interventricular abscess usually occurs as an extension of infective endocarditis from cardiac valves, most commonly aortic valve endocarditis. [4] Due to the progression of endocarditis into a paravalvular abscess, it can present as conduction blocks, and/or congestive heart failure. Even with optimal treatment, the inpatient mortality of aortic valve endocarditis has been reported as high as 40% to 79%, depending on patient age, comorbidity, and the type of organism.[]  There are several risk factors for developing infective endocarditis. These include rheumatic, congenital, and degenerative valve lesions, intracardiac prosthetic devices, intravenous drug use, and use of access devices (e.g., indwelling catheters, hemodialysis, pacemakers, etc.).[6] Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of infective endocarditis. Data from greater than 70 million hospitalizations in the United States from 1999 to 2008 suggest an increase in the incidence of Staphylococcus aureus rate of infection relative to other microorganisms. Staphylococci were implicated in 57.% of all cases, followed by streptococci and enterococci at 33.3%.[7] Bacterial presence leads to  and systemic infection as a consequence of intravascular catheters, surgical wounds, prosthetic devices, hemodialysis, etc.[8][9]Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31508436>Evaluation of the Antimicrobial and Anti-inflammatory Properties of -DFM (Norum™) in Broiler Chickens Infected With  Enteritidis.</a></h1><p>Restrictions of in-feed antibiotics use in poultry has pushed research toward finding appropriate alternatives such as Direct-Fed Microbials (DFM). In this study, previously tested  isolates (.  and . ) were used to evaluate their therapeutic and prophylactic effects against  serovar Enteritidis (. Enteritidis) in broiler chickens. For this purpose, initial antibacterial activity of -DFM (10 spores/g or 10 spores/g) against . Enteritidis  in crop, proventriculus and intestine was investigated using an  digestive model. Furthermore, to evaluate therapeutic and prophylactic effects of -DFM (10 spores/g) against . Enteritidis , altogether 60 ( = 30/group) and 30 ( = 15/group) 1-day-old broiler chickens were randomly allocated to either DFM or control group (without -DFM), respectively. Chickens were orally gavaged with 10 cfu of . Enteritidis per chicken at 1-day old, and cecal tonsils (CT) and crop were collected 3 and 10 days later during the therapeutic study, whereas they were orally gavaged with 10 cfu of . Enteritidis per chicken at 6-day-old, and CT and crop were collected 24 h later from two independent trials during the prophylactic study. Serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), FITC-d and intestinal IgA levels were reported for both chicken studies, in addition cecal microbiota analysis was performed during the therapeutic study. DFM significantly reduced . Enteritidis concentration in the intestine compartment, and in both proventriculus and intestine compartments as compared to the control when used at 10 spores/g and 10 spores/g, respectively ( < 0.05). DFM significantly reduced FITC-d and IgA as well as SOD and IgA levels ( < 0.05) compared to the control in therapeutic and prophylactic studies, respectively. Interestingly, in the therapeutic study, there were significant differences in bacterial community structure and predicted metabolic pathways between DFM and control. Likewise, phylum  and the genera , and cc_115 were decreased, while the genus  was enriched significantly in the DFM group as compared to the control (MetagenomeSeq,  < 0.05). Thus, the overall results suggest that the -DFM can reduce .

Yet, the O fugacity at the sediment-water interface (SWI) for the earliest animal proliferation is poorly defined. The preferential  of seafloor as a first step in animal evolution is also unusual. In order to understand the environmental background, we employed a new proxy, carbonate associated ferrous iron (Fe), to quantify the seafloor oxygenation. Fe of the latest Ediacaran Shibantan limestone in South China, which yields abundant animal traces, ranges from 2.27 to 85.43 ppm, corresponding to the seafloor O fugacity of 162 μmol/L to 297 μmol/L. These values are significantly higher than the oxygen saturation in seawater at the contemporary atmospheric pO levels. The highly oxygenated seafloor might be attributed to O production of the microbial mats. Despite the moderate atmospheric pO level, microbial mats possibly provided highly oxygenated niches for the evolution of benthic metazoans. Our model suggests that the O barrier could be locally overcome in the mat ground, questioning the long-held belief that atmospheric oxygenation was the key control of animal evolution.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31508783>Surveillance of multidrug-resistant bacteria in pediatric and neonatal intensive care units in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil.</a></h1><p>Multi-drug-resistant bacteria surveillance (MDR) systems are used to identify the epidemiology of MDR bacteria in neonates and children. This study aimed to describe the patterns by which MDR bacteria colonize and infect neonatal (NICU) and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients in the state of Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil.A cross-sectional survey was performed using electronic data on NICU and PICU patients reported to the Rio de Janeiro State MDR bacteria surveillance system. All healthcare institutions that reported at least one case during the study period were included.Between 2014 and 2017, 10,210 MDR bacteria cases, including 9261 colonizations and 949 infections, were reported. Among the colonizations, 5379 occurred in NICUs and 3882 in PICUs, while 405 infections occurred in NICUs and 544 in PICUs.

This work presents a scientific solution to overcome this problem by immobilizing RuBisCO into a microfluidic reactor, which demonstrates a continuous production of glucose precursor at 13.8 μmol g RuBisCO min from CO and ribulose-1,-bisphosphate. Experiments show that the RuBisCO immobilization significantly enhances enzyme stabilities (7.2 folds in storage stability, 6.7 folds in thermal stability), and also improves the reusability (90.4% activity retained after  cycles of reuse and 78.% after 10 cycles). This work mimics the NPS pathway with scalable microreactors for continuous synthesis of glucose precursor using very small amount of RuBisCO. Although still far from industrial production, this work demonstrates artificial synthesis of basic food materials by replicating the light-independent reactions of NPS, which may hold the key to food crisis relief and future space .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31502737>Gastrointestinal pathogen  and the microbiome in asymptomatic kidney transplant recipients.</a></h1><p>In kidney transplant recipients, gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens in feces are only evaluated during diarrheal episodes. Little is known about the prevalence of GI pathogens in asymptomatic individuals in this population.We recruited 142 kidney transplant recipients who provided a non-diarrheal fecal sample within the first 10 days after transplantation. The specimens were evaluated for GI pathogens using the BioFire FilmArray GI Panel (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC), which tests for 22 pathogens. The fecal microbiome was also characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the V4-V5 hypervariable region. We evaluated whether detection of Clostridioides difficile and other GI pathogens was associated with post-transplant diarrhea within the first 3 months after transplantation.Among the 142 subjects, a potential pathogen was detected in 43 (30%) using the GI Panel. The most common organisms detected were C difficile (n = 24, 17%), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (n = 8, 6%), and norovirus (n = , 4%). Detection of a pathogen on the GI panel or detection of C difficile alone was not associated with future post-transplant diarrhea (P > .05).

The overall MRSA carrier rate was 3.4% (6/175). When separated by group, the acute orthopaedic trauma cohort had an MRSA carrier rate of 1.4% (2/143), and neither MRSA-positive patient developed a surgical site infection (SSI). Only one MRSA infection occurred in the acute orthopaedic trauma cohort. The non-acute group had a significantly higher MRSA carrier rate of 12.% (4/32, p=0.01), and the elective group had the highest MRSA carrier rate of 15.4% (4/26, p<0.01). The odds ratio of MRSA  was 10.1 in the non-acute group (95% CI 1.87, 75.2) and 12.8 for true elective group (95% CI 2.36, 96.) when compared to the acute orthopaedic trauma cohort.There was a low MRSA  rate (1.4%) among patients presenting to our institution for acute fracture care. Patients undergoing elective surgery for fracture-related conditions such as nonunion, malunion, revision surgery, or implant removal have a significantly higher MRSA carrier rate (15.4%) and therefore may benefit from MRSA screening. Our results do not support routine vancomycin administration for orthopaedic trauma patients whose MRSA status is not known at the time of surgery.Prognostic Level I.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428733>Cost-effectiveness of Preoperative  Screening and Decolonization in Cochlear Implantation.</a></h1><p>Infection following cochlear implantation is medically and economically devastating. The cost-effectiveness (CE) of  screening and decolonization for infection prophylaxis in cochlear implantation has not been examined.An analytic observational study of data collected from purchasing records and the literature.Costs of   screening and decolonization were acquired from purchasing records and the literature. Infection rates after cochlear implantation and average total costs for evaluation and treatment were obtained from a review of the literature. A break-even analysis was performed to determine the required absolute risk reduction (ARR) in infection rate to make  screening or decolonization CE.Nasal screening ($144.07) is CE if the initial infection rate (1.7%) had an ARR of 0.60%. Decolonization with 2% intranasal mupirocin ointment ($.09) was CE (ARR, 0.02%). A combined decolonization technique (2% intranasal mupirocin ointment, chlorhexidine wipes, chlorhexidine shower, and prophylactic vancomycin: $37.57) was CE (ARR, 0.16%). Varying infection rate as high as 15% demonstrated that CE did not change by maintaining an ARR of 0.16%. CE of the most expensive decolonization protocol was enhanced as the cost of infection treatment increased, with an ARR of 0.03% at $125,000.Prophylactic  decolonization techniques can be CE for preventing infection following cochlear implantation. Decolonization with mupirocin is economically justified if it prevents at least 1 infection out of 5000 implants.   screening needed high reductions in infection rate to be CE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31516805>Prevalence and characteristics of methicillin-resistant   among healthcare professionals in a university hospital in Japan.</a></h1><p>Asymptomatic carriers of methicillin-resistant  (MRSA) are important sources of nosocomial transmission. MRSA may be transmitted from hospitalized patients to healthcare professionals and vice versa.The prevalence of MRSA  among forty-five healthcare professionals in a Japanese hospital was determined by performing surveillance cultures to identify unrecognized carriers of MRSA.

Currently, burn wounds are assessed for infection via examining the clinical signs and symptoms of infection, which can be confirmed by swab culture analysis. While the former approach is subjective and experience-dependant, the latter technique is susceptible to missing subsurface, biofilm-associated  and any peripheral bacterial burden, and also delays confirmation by up to  days. The MolecuLight i:X is a handheld, non-contact fluorescence imaging device, which can reveal real-time information about clinically-significant levels of bacteria and their biodistribution in surface and subsurface burn wound tissues. We conducted a single-centre observational study to assess the device efficacy in identifying critical bacterial levels in paediatric burn wounds and to test the children's compliance and the overall feasibility of the device integration into the current diagnostic practice. Ten patients with sixteen wounds were recruited and assessed for the presence or absence of clinical signs and symptoms of infection and the presence or absence of bacterial fluorescence on images, with swabs taken to confirm findings. Results demonstrate the device's ability to visualize clinically-significant bacterial burden and to localize distribution of pathogens. All clinicians agreed on the high compliance with the device and high feasibility of incorporating the device into routine wound assessments. The results of this study may pave the way towards including bacterial fluorescence imaging into the standard diagnostic algorithm for paediatric burn population.© American Burn Association 2019.

Within this dynamic landscape, pathogens that excel at invading recently colonized host populations are not necessarily those that perform best in host populations at or near their carrying capacity, potentially giving rise to divergent selection for pathogen traits that mediate the invasion process. Rarely, however, has this contention been empirically tested. Using , we explored how differences in the  history of a host population influence the invasion success of different genotypes of the pathogen . By partitioning the pathogen invasion process into a series of individual steps, we show that each pathogen optimizes invasion differently when encountering host populations that vary in their time since . All pathogen genotypes were more likely to establish successfully in recently colonized host populations, but the production of transmission spores was typically maximized in either the subsequent growth or stationary phase of host . Integrating across the first three pathogen invasion steps (initial establishment, proliferation, and secondary infection) revealed that overall pathogen invasion success (and its variance) was, nonetheless, highest in recently colonized host populations. However, only pathogens that were slow to kill their host were able to maximize host-facilitated dispersal. This suggests that only a subset of pathogen genotypes-the less virulent and more dispersive-are more likely to encounter newly colonized host populations at the front of a range expansion or in metapopulations with high extinction rates. Our results suggest a fundamental trade-off for a pathogen between dispersal and virulence, and evidence for higher invasion success in younger host populations, a finding with clear implications for pathogen evolution in spatiotemporally dynamic settings.© 2019 The Author(s).

During the research program, a total of ,001 clinical  isolates were screened for any carbapenem non-susceptibility by the disk diffusion method, Vitek 2 or Phoenix system following the EUCAST guideline on detection of resistance mechanisms, version 1.0. Strains isolated from outpatients and hospitalized patients from April 2015 to June 2015 were included. All types of samples (blood, pus, urine, etc.) excluding fecal screening or fecal  samples have been represented. In total, 171 carbapenemase screening-positive  isolates (3.42%) were found and characterized. Several methods were used for detection of carbapenemases production, including Luminex assay (PCR and hybridization), whole genome sequencing, MALDI-TOF based Imipenem degradation assay, and immunochromatography testing. Minimal inhibitory concentration determination for Meropenem by agar-based gradient method was also used. Finally, 83  strains were carbapenemase negative by all confirmation methods (49.4% of all screening-positive ones), 74 - positive by three methods (44.0%), 8 - positive by two methods (4.8%) and 3 - positive by only one method (1.8%). The sensitivity of the tests was 96.3% for Whole genome sequencing and MALDI-TOF assay (both three undetected cases), and 95.1% for Luminex-Carba (4 undetected cases). The most commonly detected carbapenemases were NDM ( = 54) and OXA-48 ( = 26), followed by KPC-2, VIM-, and OXA-72 (one case of each). Our results showed that different types of carbapenemases can be detected in the countries involved in the project. The sensitivity of our methods for carbapenemase detection (including screening as a first step and further confirmation tests) was >95%, but we would recommend using different methods to increase the sensitivity of detection and make it more precise.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666368>Genotypic characterization of LA-MRSA CC398 in pigsty visitors - Transient carriage or persistence?</a></h1><p>Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant  (LA-MRSA) of clonal complex (CC) 398 has become a rising issue for public health. While it is known that > 80% of pig farmers are colonized with LA-MRSA, only few studies assessed the situation for humans with occasional livestock contact. Recently it was shown that over 75% of scientific field workers visiting pigsties were temporarily carrying LA-MRSA.To find out whether they were transiently or permanently colonized, we used whole genome sequencing (WGS) data to analyze the relatedness of isolates from these recurrently LA-MRSA-positive field workers and from corresponding pigsties. Sequences were analyzed using  typing (, cgMLST) and the BEAST software package was used to examine phylogeny.In total, 81 samples from three field workers on eight different pigsties over a period of 2. years were sequenced. All isolates belonged to  types t011, t034 or t2011 with different types found in the same field worker at different time points. Analysis of cgMLST revealed nine genotypic clusters, mostly correlating with the pigsty on which they were sampled. Field worker isolates clustered with the samples from farms that were visited on the same day. BEAST analysis corroborated the cgMLST-based clustering and suggests an origin of the lineage about 22 years ago.We conclude that nasal LA-MRSA  among humans with occasional livestock contact is common but most likely only temporary. Furthermore, we showed that the Western German LA-MRSA CC398 originated in the late 1990s and diversified into farm-specific genotypes, which stay relatively consistent over time.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662046>. in Loggerhead Sea Turtles (): From  to Infection.</a></h1><p>With the aim of evaluating the presence of . in sea turtles with and without lesions and assessing the risk factors favoring  and/or infection, 74 loggerhead sea turtles () admitted to rescue and rehabilitation clinics in Italy were analyzed.

Among the important phenotypic modifications is the variation of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure at level of the O-antigen (OAg) presence, influencing adherence,  and the ability to evade the host defense mechanisms. The present study was performed to understand whether the loss of OAg expression during CF infection can be considered a general phenomenon in different Bcc species favoring its chronicity. In fact, it is still not clear why different Bcc species/strains differ in their ability to persist in the CF lung and pathogenic potential. The systematic two-decade-retrospective-longitudinal-screening conducted covered 357 isolates retrieved from 19 chronically infected patients receiving care at a central hospital in Lisbon. The study involved 21 Bcc strains of six/seven Bcc species/lineages, frequently or rarely isolated from CF patients worldwide. Different strains/clonal variants obtained during infection gave rise to characteristic OAg-banding patterns. The two most prevalent and feared species,  and , showed a tendency to lose the OAg along chronic infection. .  lineage IIIA strains known to lead to particularly destructive infections exhibit the most frequent OAg loss, compared with lineage IIIB. The switch frequency increased with the duration of infection and the level of lung function deterioration. For the first time, it is shown that the rarely found  and , whose representation in the cohort of patients examined is abnormally high, keep the OAg even during 10- or 15-year infections. Data from co-infections with different Bcc species reinforced these conclusions. Concerning the two other rarely found species examined, .  exhibited a stable OAg expression phenotype over the infection period while for the single clone of the more distantly related .  species, the OAg-chain was absent from the beginning of the .-year infection until the patient dead.

In contrast to other nosocomial infections, most risk factors for CR-BSI are linked to the device and can be prevented efficiently. Rates of CR-BSI higher than 1 per 1,000 catheter days are no longer acceptable. A continuous quality improvement program is effective to reduce them. Key elements of prevention of CR-BSI are hand hygiene, avoidance of insertion of unnecessary catheters, full sterile barrier precautions at insertion, preferential use of subclavian venous insertion site, cutaneous antisepsis with 2% chlorhexidine alcoholic preparation, use of chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings, immediate replacement of moistened or detached catheter dressings, and removal of catheters as soon as possible. Audit and feedback of the process of care, infection rates, and periodic re-education of health care providers are other instrumental tools in the prevention of CR-BSI. Catheter removal is the main therapeutic intervention, especially recommended in the case of sepsis or shock. While awaiting culture results, an empiric antimicrobial treatment of CR-BSI should target gram-positive microorganism (, ) and gram-negative coverage should be based on clinical variables, patients' risk factors, and previous  status. While a short course of antimicrobials (7 days) is sufficient for noncomplicated CR-BSI, a longer course of 14 days should be preferred for uncomplicated  and  CR-BSI. In case of persisting fever or positive blood culture after 3 days despite adequate antimicrobial therapy and catheter removal, catheter-related complications (e.g., endocarditis, thrombophlebitis, septic metastasis) should be ruled out.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559252>Seborrheic Dermatitis: Three Novel Trichoscopic Signs and Its Correlation to  sp. .</a></h1><p>Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic recurrent erythemato-squamous condition that affects seborrheic areas causing flaking, erythema, and pruritus.

OM subtypes in which the tympanic membrane is intact (acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion) are presumed to result from pathogen translocation through the eustachian tube. Recent molecular-based studies have suggested that a diverse middle ear microbiome exists in the absence of disease. These have been largely unsupported by culture and feature species that commonly contaminate low-biomass sequencing data. Combining culture-based and molecular techniques, we undertook a detailed investigation of the evidence for bacterial  of the healthy middle ear. Middle ear (ME), nasopharynx (NP), and external ear canal (EC) swabs were collected from a total of 25 adult patients undergoing cochlear implant, stapedotomy, or translabyrinthine vestibular schwannoma resection. Diagnostic culture, microscopy, quantitative PCR, and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing were used to assess sample bacterial content. EC and NP microbiota were consistent with previous reports. In contrast, bacterial levels in ME samples were not significantly above those in unused control swabs. Commonly detected taxa were among recognized sequencing contaminants (, , and ). Linear regression of dominant ME taxa confirmed a negative relationship between relative abundance and bacterial load, consistent with contamination. No bacteria were detected by microscopy or diagnostic culture in any middle ear sample. Our findings cast substantial doubt on previous reports identifying a healthy middle ear microbiome using 16S amplicon sequencing. Recent molecular-based studies have suggested that a diverse middle ear microbiome in adults and children can exist in the absence of disease. These studies have been largely unsupported by culture and feature species that commonly contaminate low-biomass sequencing data. While 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing has proven to be a highly informative technique in many clinical contexts, it is susceptible to spurious signal arising from sequencing reagent contaminants where sample biomass is low. Combining culture-based and molecular techniques, we undertook a detailed investigation of the evidence for bacterial  of the healthy middle ear. In finding no evidence of viable bacterial cells in middle ear samples, our study further underlines the importance of careful consideration of amplicon sequence data derived from very-low-biomass contexts and the value of analytical approaches that combine culture and molecular techniques.Copyright © 2019 Jervis-Bardy et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640585>Molecular characterization of Blastocystis subtypes in HIV-positive patients and evaluation of risk factors for .</a></h1><p>Blastocystis is one of the most common intestinal protozoa in human faecal samples with uncertain impact on public health. Studies on the prevalence of Blastocystis in HIV-positive patients are limited and dated.A cross-sectional study was carried out involving 156 HIV-positive patients to evaluate the prevalence of Blastocystis-subtypes by molecular amplification and sequencing the small subunit rRNA gene (SSU rDNA), to identify the risk factors for its transmission, to examine the relationship between the presence of the protist and gastrointestinal disorders. Furthermore, the evaluation of the faecal calprotectin by immunoassay from a sample of subjects was performed to evaluate the gut inflammation in Blastocystis-carriers.Blastocystis-subtypes ST1, ST2, ST3, ST4 were identified in 39 HIV-positive patients (25%). No correlation was found between the presence of the protist and virological or epidemiological risk factors. Blastocystis was more frequently detected in homosexual subjects (p = 0.037) infected by other enteric protozoa (p = 0.0001) and with flatulence (p = 0.024). No significant differences in calprotectin level was found between Blastocystis-carriers and free ones.Blastocystis is quite common in HIV-positive patients on ART showing in examined patients 25% prevalence. Homosexual behaviour may represent a risk factor for its transmission, while CD4 count and viremia didn't correlate with the presence of the protist. The pathogenetic role of Blastocystis remains unclear and no gut inflammation status was detected in Blastocystis-carriers. The only symptom associated with Blastocystis was the flatulence, evidencing a link between the presence of the protist and the composition and stability of gut microbiota.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637902>Influenza a virus and  coinfection potentially promotes bacterial  and enhances B lymphocyte depression and reduction.</a></h1><p>Influenza has frequently been epidemic in recent years. However, the mechanisms of severe pneumonia with postinfluenza Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) secondary infection have not been fully understood. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of pneumonia in postinfluenza A virus (IAV) infection via a mouse model. Mice were intranasally inoculated with SP three days after IAV inoculation. We then collected samples at three time points to dynamically observe the pathological progression. In IAV infection alone, lymphocyte infiltration and widened alveolar intervals were observed. In the blood, levels of the CD19+, CD19+CD21+ and CD19+CD79β+B lymphocyte subpopulations were reduced, and IFN-γ and IL-10 were elevated. Slight atrophy was seen in the spleen, which was due to splenic B lymphocyteinitiated apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. When SP infection occurred after IAV infection, the pulmonary inflammation was significantly aggravated; a fair number of lymphocytes and neutrophils infiltrated simultaneously with exfoliated bronchial epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, widened alveolar septum and hemorrhaging. Increasing edema fluid and bacteria accumulated in the alveolar cavity. Decreased CD19+, CD19+CD21+ and CD19+CD79β+B lymphocyte subpopulations and increased interferon gamma (IFN-γ) or interleukin 10 (IL-10) were more prominent compared to those with viral infection alone. Spleen atrophy resulting from coinfection was more obvious because of massive splenic B lymphocyte apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway compared to viral infection alone. This study shows that although inflammation caused by SP infection alone was temporary, preceding IAV infection provided favorable conditions for SP  and multiplication by destroying lung structure and suppressing humoral immunity. Synergistic IAV-SP coinfection is likely to facilitate more SP  and promote B lymphocyte-suppression and reduction. Eventually, the pneumonia worsened.Copyright 2019 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618711>Enhanced dissolution of silver nanoparticles in a physical mixture with platinum nanoparticles based on the sacrificial anode effect.</a></h1><p>A strategy to reduce implant-related infections is the inhibition of the initial bacterial implant  by biomaterials containing silver (Ag). The antimicrobial efficacy of such biomaterials can be increased by surface enhancement (nanosilver) or by creating a sacrificial anode system for Ag. Such a system will lead to an electrochemically driven enhanced Ag ion release due to the presence of a more noble metal. Here we combined the enlarged surface of nanoparticles (NP) with a possible sacrificial anode effect for Ag induced by the presence of the electrochemically more noble platinum (Pt) in physical mixtures of Ag NP and Pt NP dispersions. These Ag NP/Pt NP mixtures were compared to the same amounts of pure Ag NP in terms of cell biological responses, i.e. the antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli as well as the viability of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). In addition, Ag NP was analyzed by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. It was found that the dissolution rate of Ag NP was enhanced in the presence of Pt NP within the physical mixture compared to a dispersion of pure Ag NP. Dissolution experiments revealed a fourfold increased Ag ion release from physical mixtures due to enhanced electrochemical activity, which resulted in a significantly increased toxicity towards both bacteria and hMSC. Thus, our results provide evidence for an underlying sacrificial anode mechanism induced by the presence of Pt NP within physical mixtures with Ag NP. Such physical mixtures have a high potential for various applications, for example as antimicrobial implant coatings in the biomedicine or as bactericidal systems for water and surface purification in the technical area.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651305>Comparing methods to estimate incremental inpatient costs and length of stay due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Alberta, Canada.</a></h1><p>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an opportunistic bacterial organism resistant to first line antibiotics. Acquisition of MRSA is often classified as either healthcare-associated or community-acquired. It has been shown that both healthcare-associated and community-acquired infections contribute to the spread of MRSA within healthcare facilities. The objective of this study was to estimate the incremental inpatient cost and length of stay for individuals colonized or infected with MRSA. Common analytical methods were compared to ensure the quality of the estimate generated. This study was performed at Alberta Ministry of Health (Edmonton, Alberta), with access to clinical MRSA data collected at two Edmonton hospitals, and ministerial administrative data holdings.A retrospective cohort study of patients with MRSA was identified using a provincial infection prevention and control database. A coarsened exact matching algorithm, and two regression models (semilogarithmic ordinary least squares model and log linked generalized linear model) were evaluated. A MRSA-free cohort from the same facilities and care units was identified for the matched method; all records were used for the regression models. Records span from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2015, for individuals 18 or older at discharge.Of the models evaluated, the generalized linear model was found to perform the best. Based on this model, the incremental inpatient costs associated with hospital-acquired cases were the most costly at $31,686 (14,169 - 60,158) and $47,016 (23,125 - 86,332) for  and infection, respectively. Community-acquired MRSA cases also represent a significant burden, with incremental inpatient costs of $7397 (2924 - 13,180) and $14,847 (8445 - 23,207) for  and infection, respectively. All costs are adjusted to 2016 Canadian dollars. Incremental length of stay followed a similar pattern, where hospital-acquired infections had the longest incremental stays of 35.2 (16.3-69.) days and community-acquired  had the shortest incremental stays of 3.0 (0.6-6.3) days.MRSA, and in particular, hospital-acquired MRSA, places a significant but preventable cost burden on the Alberta healthcare system. Estimates of cost and length of stay varied by the method of analysis and source of infection, highlighting the importance of selecting the most appropriate method.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31417511>- and Methyl Jasmonate-Induced Resistance to  Through Enhanced Phenylpropanoid Activities in Bread Wheat ( L.).</a></h1><p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of  UBSTH-501- and methyl jasmonate-induced systemic resistance and their integration on the spot blotch pathogen,  through enhanced phenylpropanoid activities in bread wheat ( L.). It was found that the application of MeJA (>100 mg L) inhibits the germination of  spores under controlled laboratory conditions. To assess the effect of MeJA (150 mg L) in combination with the biocontrol agent  UBSTH-501 , a green house experiment was conducted. For this, biocontrol agent  UBSTH-501 was applied as seed treatment, whereas MeJA (150 mg L) was applied  days prior to pathogen inoculation. Results indicated that application of MeJA (150 mg L) did not affect the root  of wheat by  UBSTH-501 in the rhizosphere. The combined application of  UBSTH-501 and MeJA also enhanced indole acetic acid production in the rhizosphere (4.92 μg g of soil) which in turn helps in plant growth and development. Further, the combined application found to enhance the activities of defense related enzymes  catalase (.92 EU min g fresh wt.), ascorbate peroxidase [μmol ascorbate oxidized (mg prot) min], phenylalanine ammonia lyase (102.25 μmol cinnamic acid h mg fresh wt.) and peroxidase (6.95 Unit mg min fresh wt.) significantly in the plants under treatment which was further confirmed by assessing the transcript level of  and  genes using semi-quantitative PCR approach. The results showed manifold increase in salicylic acid (SA) along with enhanced accumulation of total free phenolics, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, coumaric acid, and chlorogenic acid in the leaves of the plants treated with the biocontrol agent alone or in combination with MeJA. A significant decrease in the disease severity (17.46%) and area under disease progress curve (630.32) were also observed in the treatments with biocontrol agent and MeJA in combination as compared to  alone treated plant (56.95% and 945.50, respectively). Up-regulation of phenylpropanoid cascades in response to exogenous application of MeJA and the biocontrol agent was observed. It was depicted from the results that PAL is the primary route for lignin production in wheat which reduces cell wall disruption and tissue disintegration and increases suberization and lignification of the plant cell as seen by Scanning Electron microphotographs. These results clearly indicated that exogenous application of MeJA with  inducing JA- and/or SA-dependent defense signaling after pathogen challenge may increase the resistance to spot blotch by stimulating enzymatic activities and the accumulation of phenolic compounds in a cooperative manner. This study apparently provides the evidence of biochemical cross-talk and physiological responses in wheat following MeJA and biocontrol agent treatment during the bio-trophic infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31486234>Review: Pathogenesis of Helicobacter pylori infection.</a></h1><p>In this review, we shall focus on the last year progression understanding the pathogenesis of Helicobacter pylori infection in the light of recent data related to adaptation of H pylori to the harsh acidic environment in the stomach,  of gastric mucosa via interaction with mucin  (MUC5AC) and other host cell receptors, the ability to form biofilm, interference with the host metabolic pathways, and induction of neuroimmune cross-talk as well as downregulation of gastric barrier homeostasis and its consequences for the disease development. The role of the membrane vesicles of these bacteria has been emphasized as an important source of virulence factors. Furthermore, we shall describe molecular and functional studies on new aspects of VacA and CagA virulence, including the role of urease in the upregulation of VacA toxicity, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition mediated by CagA, and the role of interaction of HopQ adhesin with carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) in CagA translocation into the host cells by the type IV secretion system (T4SS). The role of molecular mimicry between a common sequence (ATVLA) of H pylori heat shock protein (Hsp) B and human Hsp60 in the induction of potentially autoreactive antibodies is discussed.

The boring ctenostome  is unique and inhabits parchment-like polychaete tubes. Morphological studies date back to the nineteenth century, but distinct adaptations to this specific habitat have not been properly analysed, which prompted us to reexamine the morphology of this recently encountered species. The colony of  is composed of elongated stolonal kenozooids with a distal capsule-like expansion. A median transversal muscle is present in the latter, and one autozooid is laterally attached to the capsule. Unique stolonal wrinkles are embedded in the thin parts of the stolons. Single autozooids are attached in an alternating right-left succession on subsequent stolons. Polypide morphology including digestive tract, muscular system and most parts of the nervous system are similar to other ctenostomes. The most obvious apomorphic features of  are space balloons and the gnawing apparatus. The former are two fronto-lateral spherical structures on autozooids, which provide space inside the tube. The latter perforates layers of the polychaete tube wall and consists of two rows of cuticular teeth that, together with the entire vestibular wall, are introvertable during the protrusion-retraction process. The apertural muscles are in association with this gnawing apparatus heavily modified and show bilateral symmetry. Adaptations to the unique lifestyle of this species are thus evident in stolonal wrinkles, autozooidal space balloons and the gnawing apparatus. The growth pattern of the colony of  may aid in rapid  of the polychaete tube layers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654686>Spray-drying of inhalable, multifunctional formulations for the treatment of biofilms formed in cystic fibrosis.</a></h1><p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a serious lung disease, commonly susceptible to Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The dense mucus together with biofilm formation limit drug permeability and prevent the drug from reaching the site of action, causing treatment failure of the bacterial infection. Besides the use of antibiotics, the mucolytic agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is recommended to be co-administered in the treatment of CF. Although several formulations have been developed for inhalation therapy to improve the pulmonary condition in CF patients, there is still no comprehensive study on a combined multifunctional dry powder formulation of antibiotics with NAC. In this work, we developed an innovative multifunctional dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulation based on salt formation between NAC and antibiotics and characterized their solid state properties and physical stability. NAC could be spray dried together with three different antibiotics, azithromycin (Azi), tobramycin (Tobra) and ciprofloxacin (Cipro), without the use of organic solvents to form Azi/NAC, Tobra/NAC and Cipro/NAC DPI formulations. Solid-state characterization of these DPI formulations showed that they were amorphous after spray drying. Azi/NAC and Tobra/NAC form co-amorphous salt systems that were physically stable under storage at stress conditions. For particle characterization, the obtained mass median aerodynamic diameters were in a suitable range for inhalation (< .0μm). The multifunctional antibiotic/NAC formulations conserved or improved the antibiotic susceptibility and showed promising results regarding the inhibition of P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilm formation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The 261 participants completed a questionnaire on demographics, intensity of occupational swine livestock contact and glove use during handling animals and their secretions. Participants' blood samples were tested for HEV, Leptospira and A. suum seropositivity and nasal swabs cultured for MRSA. We compared swine veterinarians (defined as >3 swine livestock visits/week) to non-swine veterinarians (≤3 swine livestock visits/week) with regard to the outcomes through calculating prevalence ratio (PR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Furthermore, the relationship between occupational swine livestock contact and the study outcomes was examined by age (</≥55 years) and glove usage. The prevalence of nasal MRSA  was 13.4% (95% CI: 9.3-17.6), of HEV seropositivity 20.8% (95% CI: 15.8-25.7) and A. suum seropositivity 44% (95% CI: 37.7-50.2). The highest anti-leptospiral antibodies titres were 1:200 (L. hebdomadis) and 1:100 (L. autumnalis, L. caicola) found in three non-swine veterinarians.

Among glove-using veterinarians, occupational swine contact was no longer a determinant for HEV seropositivity (PR 1.6; 95% CI: 0.8-2.9). Similar was found for A. suum seropositivity, which was no longer associated with occupational swine livestock contact in the subgroup of glove using, ≥55-year-old veterinarians (PR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.4-3.3). Our findings indicate that >3 occupational swine livestock visits per week is associated with HEV and A. suum seropositivity and nasal MRSA  and that glove use may play a putative preventive role in acquiring HEV and A. suum.

Most members of the root microbiome possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host immunity and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root microbiota, including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root microbiome. In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic acid and its derivative 2-keto gluconic acid. Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic acids and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic acid-mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root immunity. Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root microbiome, as it facilitates  by beneficial root microbiota.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A single center retrospective case control study of UTI due to CA-ESBL-producing  during a -year period (2012-2016). Control cases with non-ESBL-producing  urinary tract infection were matched by age, gender and year of infection.  A total of 111 patients with ESBL-producing  urinary tract infection and 103 controls were included. The proportion of ESBL-producing  urinary tract infection ranged from 7% to 15% of all UTI cases. The distribution of ESBL cases per year: 27 in 2012; 18 in 2013; 22 in 2014; 15 in 2015 and 29 in 2016. Median age was 4 years with female predominance (84%). The ESBL group was predominantly African American (32%) followed by individuals of Middle Eastern ethnic background (31%). Risk factors by univariate analysis were vesicoureteral reflux: (20.9 ESBL group vs 6% controls;  = .002), prior antibiotic usage in the last 3 months (including β-lactams), prior UTI (last 3 months), recent hospitalization (last 3 months) and Middle Eastern ethnic background. However, multivariate analysis showed that only prior antibiotic usage ( = .001) and Middle Eastern ethnic background ( < .001) were independent risk factors. ESBL-producing strains were more frequently resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (72% vs 25%) and ciprofloxacin (73% vs %) than strains not producing ESBL.  Risk factors for community-acquired ESBL-producing  urinary tract in our pediatric patient population were antibiotic usage within the previous 3 months and Middle Eastern ethnic background.

This process can promote the evolution of self-fertilization, but implicating historical processes as drivers of trait evolution is often difficult and requires an explicit model of biogeographic history. In plants, contemporary limits to outcrossing are often invoked as evolutionary drivers of self-fertilization, but historical expansions may shape mating system diversity, with leading-edge populations evolving elevated selfing ability. In a widespread plant, , we identified a glacial refugium in the southern Appalachian Mountains from spatial patterns of genetic drift among 24 populations. Populations farther from this refugium have smaller effective sizes and fewer rare alleles. They also displayed elevated heterosis in among-population crosses, reflecting the accumulation of deleterious mutations during range expansion. Although populations with elevated heterosis had reduced segregating mutation load, the magnitude of inbreeding depression lacked geographic pattern. The ability to self-fertilize was strongly positively correlated with the distance from the refugium and mutation accumulation-a pattern that contrasts sharply with contemporary mate and pollinator limitation. In this and other species, diversity in sexual systems may reflect the legacy of evolution in small, colonizing populations, with little or no relation to the ecology of modern populations.© 2019 The Author(s).

In Part 2, 52 healthy persistent SA carriers were randomized to 4 groups of 13 subjects in each arm and were treated with three different concentrations of XF-73 (0. mg/g 2% gel, 2 mg/g 2% gel and 0. mg/g 4% gel) or a 4% viscosified placebo gel, respectively. Plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) studies were performed. Anti-staphylococcal activity was assessed as the presence or absence of SA and by quantification of the level of  using a semi-quantitative scale (SA score).56 subjects (8/8 from Part 1 and 48/52 from Part 2) completed the study, with 47/60 comprising the PK population and 48/60 the PD population. There was no measurable systemic absorption of XF-73 from nasal application. Treatment with XF-73 was associated with a rapid diminution in the SA scores in all subjects. The most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) reported were rhinorrhea and nasal dryness (15.% each in Part 1 and Part 2). TEAEs were mostly mild and resolved spontaneously.XF-73 was found to be safe and was tolerated with minimal side effects at doses of 0. mg/g 2% gel and 2 mg/g 2% gel in healthy volunteers. These findings support moving on to Phase 2 trials to further evaluate the efficacy of XF-73.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, life-threatening infections (eg, necrotizing pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis, and osteomyelitis) caused by PVL-SA have also been reported.We assessed the clinical phenotype, frequency, clinical implications (surgery, length of treatment in hospitals/intensive care units, and antibiotic treatments), and potential preventability of severe PVL-SA infections in children.Total, 75 children treated for PVL-SA infections in our in- and outpatient units from 2012 to 2017 were included in this retrospective study.Ten out of 75 children contracted severe infections (PVL-methicillin resistant S aureus n = 4) including necrotizing pneumonia (n = 4), necrotizing fasciitis (n = 2), pyomyositis (n = 2; including 1 patient who also had pneumonia), mastoiditis with cerebellitis (n = 1), preorbital cellulitis (n = 1), and recurrent deep furunculosis in an immunosuppressed patient (n = 1). Specific complications of PVL-SA infections were venous thrombosis (n = 2), sepsis (n = ), respiratory failure (n = ), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 3). The median duration of hospital stay was 14 days (range -52 days). In 6 out of 10 patients a history suggestive for PVL-SA  in the patient or close family members before hospital admission was identified.PVL-SA causes severe to life-threatening infections requiring lengthy treatments in hospital in a substantial percentage of symptomatic PVL-SA colonized children. More than 50% of severe infections might be prevented by prompt testing for PVL-SA in individuals with a history of abscesses or furunculosis, followed by decolonization measures.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31423064>Methicillin-Resistant  Carriage in Hemodialysis Vicinity: Prevalence and Decolonization Approach.</a></h1><p>Hemodialysis (HD) patients are at risk for developing serious infections. Methicillin- resistant  (MRSA) is one of the most prevalent pathogens in healthcare facilities with a major threat to the medical community. We aimed to determine the prevalence of MRSA  among patients and medical staff members in a HD Unit and determine efficacy of mupirocin as a decolonizing agent. This cross-sectional study enrolled 250 patients and 35 health care providers of a HD unit. Nasal and hand swabs were collected to assess the prevalence of MRSA carriage. Those exhibiting MRSA phenotype were subjected to conventional Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for detection of  gene. Colonized patients and medical personnel with MRSA were prescribed mupirocin ointment (2%) for decolonization. The screening approach identified 54/285 (18.9%) nasal MRSA carriers (41/250 of HD patients and 13/35 of the medical staff members). Concomitant extranasal MRSA  of the hands was observed in 10 (18.%) of these 54 MRSA carriers. In relation to PCR results the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of cefoxitin disk test were 98.2%, 75%, and 93.9% respectively and for MRSA Select II agar screening method, the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were 92.6%, 66.7%, and 87.9% respectively. Decolonization approach using mupirocin ointment revealed an overall success rate up to 77.8% (42/54) and failure rate of 16.7% (9/54), while .6% (3/54) of decolonized carriers showed recolonization. There is still high prevalence of MRSA  in HD vicinity. Implementation of strict infection control measures is essential in dialysis units to avoid MRSA cross-transmission and invasive infections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504356>The quagga mussel genome and the evolution of freshwater tolerance.</a></h1><p>Freshwater dreissenid mussels evolved from marine ancestors during the Miocene ∼30 million years ago and today include some of the most successful and destructive invasive species of freshwater environments. Here, we sequenced the genome of the quagga mussel Dreissena rostriformis to identify adaptations involved in embryonic osmoregulation. We provide evidence that a lophotrochozoan-specific aquaporin water channel, a vacuolar ATPase subunit and a sodium/hydrogen exchanger are involved in osmoregulation throughout early cleavage, during which time large intercellular fluid-filled 'cleavage cavities' repeatedly form, coalesce and collapse, expelling excess water to the exterior. Independent expansions of aquaporins coinciding with at least five freshwater  events confirm their role in freshwater adaptation. Repeated aquaporin expansions and the evolution of membrane-bound fluid-filled osmoregulatory structures in diverse freshwater taxa point to a fundamental principle guiding the evolution of freshwater tolerance and provide a framework for future species control efforts.© The Author(s) 2019.

Staphylococcus epidermidis is also prevalent within the sinonasal microbiota and may inhibit S. aureus . We investigated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer pairs for measuring absolute abundances of S. aureus and S. epidermidis, then compared bacterial community composition and absolute abundances of these species between CRS patients and controls.Six candidate Staphylococcus species-specific primer pairs were tested in silico and in vitro against pure bacterial isolates. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) for absolute quantification of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and overall bacterial load were assessed in 40 CRS (CRS without nasal polyposis [CRSsNP] = 22, CRS with nasal polyposis [CRSwNP] = 18) patients and 14 controls. Amplicon sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) bacterial gene were conducted to investigate community composition.Primer pairs targeting the gmk gene of S. aureus and nrd gene from S. epidermidis were the most specific and sensitive primers. S. aureus (CRSsNP = 81.8% occurrence, CRSwNP = 83%, control = 92.9%) and S. epidermidis (CRSsNP = 95.%, CRSwNP = 100%, control = 92.9%) were very prevalent, as indicated by qPCR results. Both CRSsNP and CRSwNP had significantly (p < 0.05) higher bacterial load when compared with controls (p < 0.05 for both). No significant correlation was observed between S. aureus and S. epidermidis abundances (p > 0.05).Bacterial community sequencing detected Staphylococcus-assigned sequences in nearly all patients; however, it could not differentiate between S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Here, we present primer pairs that can distinguish between these species.

This study, therefore, aimed to assess the nasal and hand carriage of Staphylococcus aureus among food handlers in Jimma Town.A community based cross sectional study was conducted from February to May 2017. Swab specimens from nasopharyngeal and hands of food handlers working in food establishments were collected for isolation and identification of S. aureus using standard bacteriological methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was done using disc diffusion method. Associations of selected variables for S. aureus  were determined using SPSS version 20 with p ≤ 0.05 taken as statistically significant.Among the 300 food handlers working in hotels and restaurants in Jimma Town, 86(28.7%) were colonized by S. aureus. The frequency of isolation of S. aureus from nose, hand and both parts (nose and hand) were 27(9%), 34(11.3%) and 25(8.3%), respectively. There was strong association (P=0.00336) between carriage rate of S. aureus and food handlers' job category. The majority (90.7%) of the isolates were resistant to Penicillin and Ampicillin. Increased levels of sensitivity were observed against Ciprofloxacin (96.%), Cefoxitin (95.3%) and Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid (94.2%).This study revealed a high prevalence of S. aureus carriers among food handlers and high antibacterial resistance towards commonly prescribed drugs, justifying the screening of food handlers to detect and treat carriers and protect restaurant customers from staphylococcal food poisoning.© 2019 Getenet Beyene, et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31503161>Antibiotic Use Without Indication During Delivery Hospitalizations in the United States.</a></h1><p>To analyze trends in unindicated antibiotic use during vaginal delivery hospitalization.This study used an administrative database to analyze antibiotic use during delivery hospitalizations from January 2006 to March 2015.

On day , RV SA11 was intragastrically delivered to induce infection and diarrhea assessment, microbiota composition, and gene expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the small intestine were studied. All dietary interventions showed reduction in clinical variables of RV-induced diarrhea. RV infection increased TLR2 expression, whereas 2'-FL boosted TLR5 and TLR7 expressions and scGOS/lcFOS increased that of TLR9. RV-infected rats displayed an intestinal dysbiosis that was effectively prevented by the dietary interventions, and consequently, their microbiota was more similar to microbiota of the noninfected groups.

One way in which  achieves this duality is through concealing or exposing cell wall pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in response to host-derived environment cues (pH, hypoxia, and lactate). This cell wall remodeling allows  to evade or hyperactivate the host's innate immune responses, leading to disease. Previously, we showed that adaptation of  to acidic environments, conditions encountered during  of the female reproductive tract, induces significant cell wall remodeling resulting in the exposure of two key fungal PAMPs (β-glucan and chitin). Here, we report that this pH-dependent cell wall remodeling is time dependent, with the initial change in pH driving cell wall unmasking, which is then remasked at later time points. Remasking of β-glucan was mediated via the cell density-dependent fungal quorum sensing molecule farnesol, while chitin remasking was mediated via a small, heat-stable, nonproteinaceous secreted molecule(s).

The  cell adhesion protein Als1p is a highly expressed member of a large family of paralogous adhesins. Als1p can mediate binding to epithelial and endothelial cells, is upregulated in infections, and is important for biofilm formation. Als1p includes an amyloid-forming sequence at amino acids 325 to 331, identical to the sequence in the paralogs Als5p and Als3p. Therefore, we mutated Val326 to test whether this sequence is important for activity. Wild-type Als1p (Als1p) and Als1p with the V326N mutation (Als1p) were expressed at similar levels in a  surface display model. Als1p cells adhered to bovine serum albumin (BSA)-coated beads similarly to Als1p cells. However, cells displaying Als1p showed visibly smaller aggregates and did not fluoresce in the presence of the amyloid-binding dye Thioflavin-T. A new analysis tool for single-molecule force spectroscopy-derived surface mapping showed that statistically significant force-dependent Als1p clustering occurred in Als1p cells but was absent in Als1p cells. In single-cell force spectroscopy experiments, strong cell-cell adhesion was dependent on an intact amyloid core sequence on both interacting cells. Thus, the major adhesin Als1p interacts through amyloid-like β-aggregation to cluster adhesin molecules in  on the cell surface as well as in  to form cell-cell bonds. Microbial cell surface adhesins control essential processes such as adhesion, , and biofilm formation. In the opportunistic fungal pathogen , the gglutinin-ike equence () gene family encodes eight cell surface glycoproteins that mediate adherence to biotic and abiotic surfaces and cell-cell aggregation. Als proteins are critical for commensalism and virulence. Their activities include attachment and invasion of endothelial and epithelial cells, morphogenesis, and formation of biofilms on host tissue and indwelling medical catheters. At the molecular level, Als5p-mediated cell-cell aggregation is dependent on the formation of amyloid-like nanodomains between Als5p-expressing cells. A single-site mutation to valine 326 abolishes cellular aggregation and amyloid formation. Our results show that the binding characteristics of Als1p follow a mechanistic model similar to Als5p, despite its differential expression and biological roles.Copyright © 2019 Ho et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620110>The Responses of Germ-Free Zebrafish () to Varying Bacterial Concentrations,  Time Points, and Exposure Duration.</a></h1><p>Colonizing germ-free (GF) zebrafish with specific bacterial species provides the possibility of understanding the influence on host biological processes including gene expression, development, immunity, and behavioral responses. It also enlightens our understanding on the host-microbe interactions within the physiological context of a living host. However, the responses of GF zebrafish to various  conditions such as bacterial concentrations,  time points, and exposure duration remain unclear. To address this issue, we explored the responses of GF zebrafish by using two bacterial species at varying concentrations,  time points and exposure duration. Therefore, we mono-associated GF zebrafish with  DH5α or  WB800N at concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml either at 3 day post fertilization (dpf) or  dpf for 24 or 48 h. We evaluated the responses of GF zebrafish by analyzing the survival rate,  efficiency, nutrients metabolism, intestinal cell proliferation, innate immunity, stress, and behavior responses by comparing it to conventionally raised zebrafish (CONR) and GF zebrafish. The results indicated that the final bacteria concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml did not cause any mortality when GF mono-associated larvae were exposed to either  DH5α or  WB800N at 3 or  dpf, while concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml increased the mortality, particularly for  dpf owing to the decrease in dissolved oxygen level. The  DH5α mainly induced the expression of genes related to nutrients metabolism, cell proliferation and immunity, while  WB800N mainly upregulated the expression of genes related to immunity and stress responses. Moreover, our data revealed that GF zebrafish showed higher levels of physical activity than CONR and the microbial  reduced the hyperactivity of GF zebrafish, suggesting  of bacteria affected behavior characteristics.

Both have been associated with delayed growth in children and are the main causative agents of traveler's diarrhea. The pathogenesis of both bacteria starts by adhering to the intestinal epithelium by means of fimbriae, called  factors in human ETEC isolates and aggregative adherence fimbriae in EAEC isolates. Once ETEC adheres to the enterocyte, it produces one or both of its toxins and induces the secretion of chloride and sodium ions and water into the intestinal lumen, producing its characteristic watery diarrhea. EAEC binds to the intestinal epithelium forming a biofilm, induces the production of mucus, releases its toxins and promotes inflammation. EAEC and ETEC infection models with wild-type C57BL/6 and CD40 ligand-deficient mice (with intact microbiota), respectively, revealed that undernutrition and low-zinc diet increases EAEC infection, causing growth retardation, and that ETEC colonizes, persists and induces local and systemic humoral immune response.Copyright: © 2019 Permanyer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606698>Nanoparticles at biointerfaces: Antibacterial activity and nanotoxicology.</a></h1><p>Development of a biomaterial that is resistant to the adhesion and consequential proliferation of bacteria, represents a significant challenge in terms of application of such materials in various aspects of health care.

We determined nasal carriage of S. aureus in patients undergoing MHS by comparing the yield of a conventional culture with that of a rapid molecular test (Xpert® SA Nasal Complete, Cepheid).From July 2015 to April 2017, all patients who were to undergo MHS were invited to participate in the study. We obtained two nasal cultures from each patient just before entering the operating room, independently of a previous test for the determination of nasal  by this microorganism performed before surgery. One swab was used for conventional culture in the microbiology laboratory, and the other was used for the rapid molecular test. We defined nasal  as the presence of a positive culture for S. aureus using either of the two techniques. All patients were followed up until hospital discharge or death.Overall, 57 out of 200 patients (28.%) were colonized by S. aureus at the time of surgery. Thirty-three patients had both conventional culture- and PCR-positive results. Twenty-four patients had a negative culture and a positive PCR test. Only twenty-one percent (12/57) of colonized patients had undergone an attempt to decolonise before the surgical intervention.A significant proportion of patients undergoing MHS are colonized by S. aureus in the nostrils on entering the operating room. New strategies to prevent SSI by this microorganism are needed. Rapid molecular tests immediately before MHS, followed by immediate decolonisation, must be evaluated.

Using plants grown in natural soil and community profiling of bacterial 16S rRNA genes and fungal internal transcribed spacers (ITSs), we examined the role of the  symbiosis genes , , , and  in structuring bacterial and fungal root-associated communities. We found host genotype-dependent community shifts in the root and rhizosphere compartments that were mainly confined to bacteria in  or fungi in  mutants, while  and  plants displayed major changes across both microbial kingdoms. We observed in all AM mutant roots an almost complete depletion of a large number of Glomeromycota taxa that was accompanied by a concomitant enrichment of Helotiales and Nectriaceae fungi, suggesting compensatory niche replacement within the fungal community. A subset of Glomeromycota whose  is strictly dependent on the common symbiosis pathway was retained in  mutants, indicating that  is dispensable for intraradical  by some Glomeromycota fungi. However, intraradical  by bacteria belonging to the  and  is dependent on AM root infection, revealing a microbial interkingdom interaction. Despite the overall robustness of the bacterial root microbiota against major changes in the composition of root-associated fungal assemblages, bacterial and fungal cooccurrence network analysis demonstrates that simultaneous disruption of AM and rhizobium symbiosis increases the connectivity among taxa of the bacterial root microbiota. Our findings imply a broad role for  symbiosis genes in structuring the root microbiota and identify unexpected microbial interkingdom interactions between root symbionts and commensal communities. Studies on symbiosis genes in plants typically focus on binary interactions between roots and soilborne nitrogen-fixing rhizobia or mycorrhizal fungi in laboratory environments. We utilized wild type and symbiosis mutants of a model legume, grown in natural soil, in which bacterial, fungal, or both symbioses are impaired to examine potential interactions between the symbionts and commensal microorganisms of the root microbiota when grown in natural soil. This revealed microbial interkingdom interactions between the root symbionts and fungal as well as bacterial commensal communities. Nevertheless, the bacterial root microbiota remains largely robust when fungal symbiosis is impaired. Our work implies a broad role for host symbiosis genes in structuring the root microbiota of legumes.Copyright © 2019 Thiergart et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622538>Fecal microbiota transplantation results in bacterial strain displacement in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</a></h1><p>Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which is thought to have the potential to correct dysbiosis of gut microbiota, has been used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) for almost a decade. Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying microbiota engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and (2) patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from  individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in microbiota induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial  was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

Antibiotic resistant infections disproportionately affect those with immunocompromising conditions, chronic , and frequent antibiotic use such as transplant patients or those with cystic fibrosis. However, clinicians lack the diagnostic tools to confidently diagnose and treat infections, leading to widespread use of empiric broad spectrum antimicrobials, often for prolonged duration.A 22 year-old Caucasian female with cystic fibrosis received a bilateral orthotopic lung transplantation  months prior to the index hospitalization. She underwent routine surveillance bronchoscopy and was admitted for post-procedure fever. A clear cause of infection was not identified by routine methods. Imaging and bronchoscopic lung biopsy did not identify an infectious agent or rejection. She was treated with a prolonged course of antimicrobials targeting known colonizing organisms from prior bronchoalveolar lavage cultures (Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aureus, and Aspergillus). However, we identified Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in two independent whole blood samples using direct-pathogen sequencing, which was not identified by other methods.This case represents a common clinical conundrum: identification of infection in a high-risk, complex patient. Here, direct-pathogen sequencing identified a pathogen that would not otherwise have been identified by common techniques. Had results been clinically available, treatment could have been customized, avoiding a prolonged course of broad spectrum antimicrobials that would only exacerbate resistance. Direct-pathogen sequencing is poised to fill a diagnostic gap for pathogen identification, allowing early identification and customization of treatment in a culture-independent, pathogen-agnostic manner.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447522>The Prevalence and Risk Factors Associated with Nasal Methicillin-Resistant   among Children in a Tertiary Hospital in Nigeria.</a></h1><p>Nasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)  is of public health concern due to increased risk of developing invasive infections and the therapeutic challenges. This concern is more among the vulnerable group. We determined the prevalence and associated risk factors of MRSA nasal carriage among children in a tertiary hospital in Nigeria.We conducted a hospital-based, cross-sectional study among 300 children attending the outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital recruited through systematic sampling technique. An interviewer-administered, structured questionnaire was used to obtain sociodemographic characteristics and exposure factors. Nasal swabs samples were collected and inoculated on mannitol salt agar and subcultured on nutrient agar to isolate Staphylococcus aureus. We used the conventional Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique to detect the presence of mecA gene for MRSA. We calculated the prevalence, prevalence odds ratio to determine risk factors for MRSA acquisition at % level of significance.The median age was 1.7 years (6 months-16 years). Males accounted for 60.7%, and 75% of the participants were under  years. Staphylococcus aureus  was found in 36.3% of the participants while .3% of the participants had MRSA identified by detecting the mecA gene. History of recent surgery in the last six months was the only independent predictor of nasal MRSA  among the participants (aOR=12.; 95%CI: 2.7-50.0.).The high prevalence of MRSA  observed among the children in this study suggests the need to consider screening children with history of previous surgery as infection control and prevention intervention for MRSA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600410>Soil strength influences wheat root interactions with soil macropores.</a></h1><p>Deep rooting is critical for access to water and nutrients found in subsoil. However, damage to soil structure and the natural increase in soil strength with depth, often impedes root penetration. Evidence suggests that roots use macropores (soil cavities greater than 75 μm) to bypass strong soil layers. If roots have to exploit structures, a key trait conferring deep rooting will be the ability to locate existing pore networks; a trait called trematotropism. In this study, artificial macropores were created in repacked soil columns at bulk densities of 1.6 g cm and 1.2 g cm , representing compact and loose soil. Near isogenic lines of wheat, Rht-B1a and Rht-B1c, were planted and root-macropore interactions were visualized and quantified using X-ray computed tomography. In compact soil, 68.8% of root-macropore interactions resulted in pore , compared with 12.% in loose soil. Changes in root growth trajectory following pore interaction were also quantified, with 21.0% of roots changing direction (±3°) in loose soil compared with 76.0% in compact soil. These results indicate that  of macropores is an important strategy of wheat roots in compacted subsoil. Management practices to reduce subsoil compaction and encourage macropore formation could offer significant advantage in helping wheat roots penetrate deeper into subsoil.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615960>Probiotic Yeasts Inhibit Virulence of Non Species.</a></h1><p>Systemic infections of  species pose a significant threat to public health.

Being a primary cause of persistent human infections, biofilm forming ability of S. aureus plays a pivotal role in the development of antibiotic resistance. Hence, targeting biofilm is an alternative strategy to fight bacterial infections. The present study for the first time demonstrates the non-antibacterial biofilm inhibitory efficacy of -Dodecanolide (DD) against ATCC strain and clinical isolates of S. aureus. In addition, DD is able to inhibit adherence of MRSA on human plasma coated Titanium surface. Further, treatment with DD significantly reduced the eDNA synthesis, autoaggregation, staphyloxanthin biosynthesis and ring biofilm formation. Reduction in staphyloxanthin in turn increased the susceptibility of MRSA to healthy human blood and HO exposure. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed the induced expression of agrA and agrC upon DD treatment. This resulted down regulation of genes involved in biofilm formation such as fnbA and fnbB and up regulation of RNAIII, hld, psmα and genes involved in biofilm matrix degradation such as aur and nuc. Inefficacy of DD on the biofilm formation of agr mutant further validated the agr mediated antibiofilm potential of DD. Notably, DD was efficient in reducing the in vivo  of MRSA in Caenorhabditis elegans.

Neurotransplantation therapy could become a hopeful method, but there are still many limitations and unknown aspects. Studies in a variety of cerebellar mutant mice reflecting heterogeneity of human cerebellar degenerations show promising results as well as new problems and questions to be answered. The aim of this work was to compare the development of embryonic cerebellar grafts in adult B6CBA Lurcher and B6.BR pcd mutant mice and strain-matched healthy wild type mice. Performance in the rotarod test, graft survival, structure, and volume was examined 2 months after the transplantation or sham-operation. The grafts survived in most of the mice of all types. In both B6CBA and B6.BR wild type mice and in pcd mice,  of the host's cerebellum was a common finding, while in Lurcher mice, the grafts showed a low tendency to infiltrate the host's cerebellar tissue. There were no significant differences in graft volume between mutant and wild type mice. Nevertheless, B6CBA mice had smaller grafts than their B6.BR counterparts. The transplantation did not improve the performance in the rotarod test.

After removal, each AI-EVD was cultured and assessed for antimicrobial activity on both internal and external sides of AI-EVDs. Catheters were each challenged with a single Staphylococcus strain [MSSA, MRSA or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE)]. MS was used to measure residual concentrations of rifampicin and clindamycin.Sixty-five AI-EVDs were included (56 patients). Among these, 21 were challenged with MSSA, 23 with MRSA and 21 with MRSE.

We characterised the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing K. pneumoniae (ESBLp KPN) population in our hospital using mini-MLST. Then we used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to compare selected isolates belonging to the most prevalent melting types (MelTs) and the /infection pair isolates collected from one patient to study the ESBLp KPN population's genetic diversity. A total of 922 ESBLp KPN isolates collected between 7/2016 and /2018 were divided into 38 MelTs using mini-MLST with only 6 MelTs forming 82.8% of all isolates. For WGS, 14 isolates from the most prominent MelTs collected in the monitored period and 10 isolates belonging to the same MelTs collected in our hospital in 2014 were randomly selected. Resistome, virulome and ST were MelT specific and stable over time. A maximum of 23 SNV per core genome and 58 SNV per core and accessory genome were found. To determine the SNV relatedness cut-off values, 22 isolates representing /infection pair samples obtained from 11 different patients were analysed by WGS with a maximum of 22 SNV in the core genome and 40 SNV in the core and accessory genome within pairs. The mini-MLST showed its potential for real-time epidemiology in clinical practice. However, for outbreak evaluation in a low diversity bacterial population, mini-MLST should be combined with more sensitive methods like WGS. Our findings showed there were only minimal differences within the core and accessory genome in the low diversity hospital population and gene based SNV analysis does not have enough discriminatory power to differentiate isolate relatedness.

In this systematic literature review, we obtained published data regarding the maternal GBS  rate, incidence of invasive GBS disease in infants, clinical screening, and the associated GBS typing and clinical outcomes in China. The maternal GBS  rate in mainland China ranged from 3.7 to 14.52%, and the incidence of invasive GBS disease in infants was 0.55-1.79 per 1000 live births, with a case fatality risk ranging from 6.45 to 7.1%. Serotype III was the dominant serotype that was observed in GBS isolates. GBS detection and identification has become more commonplace, due to the availability of polymerase chain reaction and DNA microarray technologies. Immunizing pregnant women against GBS is an emerging approach through which newborns are protected from GBS. The available data suggest that five GBS serotypes (Ia, Ib, II, III, and V) account for the majority of the cases of GBS disease in mainland China.

As such, development of a vaccine would be advantageous for public health. One strategy is to use subunits of  factors combined with antigen/adjuvant toxoids as an ETEC vaccine. Here, we investigated the intradermal (i.d.) or sublingual (s.l.) delivery of CFA/I fimbrial antigens, including CfaEB and a CfaE-heat-labile toxin B subunit (LTB) chimera admixed with double mutant heat-labile toxin (LT) LT-R192G/L211A (dmLT). In addition, we compared dmLT with other LT proteins to better understand the generation of adjuvanted fimbrial and toxoid immunity as well as the influence on any local skin reactogenicity. We demonstrate that immunization with dmLT admixed with CfaEB induces robust serum and fecal antibody responses to CFA/I fimbriae and LT but that i.d. formulations are not optimal for s.l. delivery. Improved s.l. vaccination outcomes were observed when higher doses of dmLT (1 to  μg) were admixed with CfaEB or, even better, when a CfaE-LTB chimera antigen was used instead. Serum anti-CFA/I total antibodies, detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were the best predictor of functional antibodies, based on the inhibition of red blood cell agglutination by ETEC. Immunization with other LT proteins or formulations with altered B-subunit binding during i.d. immunization (e.g., by addition of % lactose, LTA1, or LT-G33D) minimally altered the development of antibody responses and cytokine recall responses but reduced skin reactogenicity at the injection site.

At 20 days after inoculation, we evaluated soluble metabolites of each genotype and treatment measured by GC-MS. In this analysis, when comparing non-AM roots between genotypes, I-1 had a lower amount of 31 and higher amount of only 4 metabolites than the UI-4 genotype. When comparing AM roots, I-1 had a lower amount of 36 and higher amount of 4 metabolites than UI-4 (different to those found altered in non-AM treated plants). Lastly, comparing the AM vs non-AM treatments, I-1 had increased levels of three and reduced levels of 24 metabolites, while UI-4 only had levels of 12 metabolites reduced by the effect of mycorrhizas. We found the major changes in sugars, polyols, amino acids, and carboxylic acids. In a targeted analysis, we found lower levels of isoflavonoids and alpha-tocopherol and higher levels of malondialdehyde in the I-1 genotype that can affect soybean-AM symbiosis. Our studies have the potential to support improving soybean with a greater capacity to be colonized and responsive to AM interaction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447791>Spatial Environmental Heterogeneity Determines Young Biofilm Assemblages on Microplastics in Baltic Sea Mesocosms.</a></h1><p>Microplastics in aquatic environments provide novel habitats for surface-colonizing microorganisms. Given the continuing debate on whether substrate-specific properties or environmental factors prevail in shaping biofilm assemblages on microplastics, we examined the influence of substrate vs. spatial factors in the development of bacterial assemblages on polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), wood, and seston and in the free-living fraction. Further, the selective  of microplastics by potential pathogens was investigated because among the bacterial species found in microplastic-associated biofilms are potentially pathogenic  spp. Due to their persistence and great dispersal potential, microplastics could act as vectors for these potential pathogens and for biofilm assemblages in general. Incubation experiments with these substrates were conducted for 7 days during a summer cruise along the eastern Baltic Sea coastline in waters covering a salinity gradient of 4.-9 PSU. Bacterial assemblages were analyzed using 16S rRNA-gene amplicon sequencing, distance-based redundancy analyses, and the linear discriminant analysis effect size method to identify taxa that were significantly more abundant on the plastics. The results showed that the sample type was the most important factor structuring bacterial assemblages overall. Surface properties were less significant in differentiating attached biofilms on PE, PS, and wood; instead, environmental factors, mainly salinity, prevailed. A potential role for inorganic-nutrient limitations in surface-specific attachment was identified as well.  (, , and ) and  ( and ) were distinctive for the PE- and PS-associated biofilms.  was more abundant on the PE and PS biofilms than on seston, but its abundances were highest on wood and positively correlated with salinity. These results corroborate earlier findings that microplastics constitute a habitat for biofilm-forming microorganisms distinct from seston, but less from wood. In contrast to earlier reports of low  numbers on microplastics, these results also suggest that vibrios are early colonizers of surfaces in general. Spatial as well as temporal dynamics should therefore be considered when assessing the potential of microplastics to serve as vectors for bacterial assemblages and putative pathogens, as these parameters are major drivers of biofilm diversity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645841>Implications of the presence of yeasts in tracheobronchial secretions of critically ill intubated patients.</a></h1><p>The presence of some microorganisms in the respiratory tract is a known risk factor for the infection of air passages; however, it is not clear whether this holds true for  spp. Thus, our objective was to determine the frequency of yeast  in the tracheobronchial secretions of critically ill intubated patients and to assess the presence of these yeasts in the infra-cuff region of the endotracheal tube (ET). Patients aged 18 years or older who had been using an endotracheal tube for 48 hours were recruited. Tracheal secretions were collected; after extubation, the ETs were cut into two fragments in the infra-cuff region. One of these fragments was placed in a solution containing antibiotics and sent to the lab for culture and identification of yeasts. The remaining fragment was fixed and subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In total, 20 patients with an average age of 73.3 years (± 13.1) participated in this study. These patients remained under endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation for an average of 6.4 (± 1.8) and 13. days (± 15), respectively. Of these patients, 45 % showed respiratory tract  by yeasts of the  genus, with  being the most frequently isolated species (66.7 %). Moreover, in almost 90 % of these patients, blastoconidia of the same yeast were found in the infra-cuff portion of the ET, as evidenced by SEM, strongly fixed on the ET surface. Yeasts isolated from both the infra-cuff region and the tracheobronchial secretions were susceptible to amphotericin B and fluconazole. In conclusion, our results show that the frequency of  by yeasts of the  genus in the tracheobronchial secretions of intubated patients within 48 hours is high, and that these species can also be found as a biofilm on the ET surface.Copyright © 2019 Ferreira et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31404682>Ribotype variability of Clostridioides difficile strains in patients with hospital-acquired C. difficile infections, community-acquired C. difficile infections, and  with toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains of C. difficile.</a></h1><p>There have been few available data that presented a direct comparison between polymerase chain reaction ribotype (RT) distribution of Clostridioides difficile strains from C. difficile infection (CDI) and . To understand the epidemiology of CDI in a hospital setting, we compared RTs of C. difficile strains from hospital-acquired CDI (HA-CDI) and toxigenic  and from community-acquired CDI (CA-CDI) and non-toxigenic  using the stool samples submitted for C. difficile cultures at an institution during 2009, 2012, and 2014. Overall, 721 C. difficile strains were identified from 607 patients. Among them, 450 (62.4%) were HA-CDI, 20 (2.8%) were CA-CDI, 126 (17.%) were toxigenic , and 125 (17.3%) were non-toxigenic . RT018, RT017, RT002, RT015, and RT001 isolates were the most prevalent RTs in HA-CDI, and they comprised 74.9% of the total HA-CDI isolates but accounted for 60.4% of isolates from toxigenic . In total, 32 strain compromising 18 RTs from HA-CDI (7.1%) were not seen among the toxigenic  group, and 3 RTs with  strains from toxigenic  were not seen among the HA-CDI group. The distribution of RTs was the most diverse in CA-CDI and the least diverse in HA-CDI. Although  RT strains, which were prevalent in HA-CDI, comprised 40% of CA-CDI,  isolates (25%) revealed unknown RTs, which were uncommon in HA-CDI or toxigenic . In 12 patients with both episodes of CDI and toxigenic , 8 had 2 isolates with different RTs and 4 had isolates with identical RTs. In conclusion, although RT017 and RT018 were the most common in HA-CDI and toxigenic , C. difficile strains from toxigenic  were more diverse than those from HA-CDI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To better understand how the unique immunological milieu of pregnancy increases susceptibility to infection, we study listeriosis in cynomolgus macaques, a non-human primate that closely resembles humans in placentation and in the physiology, and immunology of pregnancy. Non-human primates are naturally susceptible to Lm infection, and spontaneous abortions due to listeriosis are known to occur in outdoor macaque colonies, making them ideal models to understand the disease pathogenesis and host-pathogen relationship of listeriosis. We have previously shown that Lm infection in the first trimester has a high rate of miscarriage. This study expands on our previous findings by assessing how the quantity of Lm as well as stage of pregnancy at the time of exposure may influence disease susceptibility. In the current study we inoculated a cohort of macaques with a lower dose of Lm than our previous study and although this did not result in fetal demise, there was evidence of  inflammation and fetal distress. Animals that were reinfected with an equivalent or higher dose of the same strain of Lm resulted in approximately half of cases continuing to term and half ending in fetal demise. These cases had inconsistent bacterial  of the fetal compartment, suggesting that Lm does not need to directly infect the placenta to cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. Timed surgical collection of tissues following inoculation demonstrated that transmission from mother to fetus can occur as soon as  days post-inoculation. Lastly, third trimester inoculation resulted in pregnancy loss in 3 out of 4 macaques, accompanied by characteristic pathology and Lm . Collectively, our studies demonstrate that common laboratory culture tests may not always recover Lm despite known maternal ingestion. Notably, we also find it is possible for maternal infection to resolve in some cases with no discernible adverse outcome; however, such cases had evidence of a sterile intrauterine inflammatory response, with unknown consequences for fetal development.Copyright © 2019 Wolfe, Kerr, Mejia, Simmons, Czuprynski and Golos.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573026>Determining the utility of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus nares screening in antimicrobial stewardship.</a></h1><p>Treatment of suspected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a cornerstone of many antibiotic regimens; however, antibiotics are associated with toxicity. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals screen each patient on admission and transfer for MRSA nares . The objective of this study was to determine the negative predictive value (NPV) of MRSA screening in the determinization of subsequent positive clinical culture for MRSA. High NPVs with MRSA nares screening maybe used as a stewardship tool for de-escalation as well as avoidance of anti-MRSA therapy.This was a retrospective cohort study across VA medical centers nationwide from January 1, 2007 to January 1, 2018. Data from patients with MRSA nares screening upon admission or transfer were obtained from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. Subsequent clinical cultures within 7 days of the nares swab were evaluated for presence of MRSA. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPVs), and NPVs were calculated for the entire cohort, as well as subgroups for specific culture sites.This cohort yielded 561,325 clinical cultures from a variety of anatomical sites. The sensitivity and specificity for positive MRSA clinical culture were 67.4% and 81.2%, respectively. The NPV of MRSA nares screening for ruling out MRSA infection was 96.%. The NPV for bloodstream infections was 96.%, for intra-abdominal cultures was 98.6%, for respiratory cultures was 96.1%, for wound cultures was 93.1%, and for cultures from the urinary system was 99.2%.Given the high NPVs, MRSA nares screening may be a powerful stewardship tool for de-escalation and avoidance of empirical anti-MRSA therapy.© The Author(s) 2019.

In each experiment, sixty-one day-of-hatch female turkey poults were obtained from a local hatchery. In both experiments, poults were challenged via oral gavage with 10 cfu/poult of SE and randomly allocated to one of two groups ( = 30 poults): (1) the positive control group and (2) the probiotic treated group. Heated brooder batteries were used for housing each group separately and poults were allowed ad libitum access to water and unmedicated turkey starter feed. 1 h following the SE challenge, poults were treated with 10 cfu/poult of probiotic culture via oral gavage or phosphate-buffered saline （PBS）to control groups. A total of 24 h post-treatment, poults were euthanized and the ceca and cecal tonsils from twenty poults were collected aseptically for SE recovery. In both trials, a significant reduction in the incidence and log cfu/g of SE were observed in poults treated with the probiotic when compared with control poults ( ≤ 0.05). The results of the present study suggest that the administration of this lactic acid-producing bacteria (LAB)-based probiotic 1 h after an SE challenge can be useful in reducing the cecal  of this pathogen in neonatal poults.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592031>Extracellular vesicles in host-pathogen interactions and immune regulation - exosomes as emerging actors in the immunological theater of pregnancy.</a></h1><p>This review correlates and summarizes the role of the maternal-fetal interface in the immune tolerance of the fetus and the processes that lead to infection avoidance, emphasizing the participation of exosomes and other extracellular vesicles in both situations. Exosomes are released into the extracellular medium by several cell types and are excellent carriers of biomolecules. Host-derived exosomes and the transport of pathogen-derived molecules by exosomes impact infections in different ways. The interactions of exosomes with the maternal immune system are pivotal to a favorable gestational outcome. In this review, we highlight the potential role of exosomes in the establishment of an adequate milieu that enables embryo implantation and discuss the participation of exosomes released at the maternal-fetal interface during the establishment of an immune-privileged compartment for fetal development. The placenta is a component where important strategies are used to minimize the risk of infection. To present a contrast, we also discuss possible mechanisms used by pathogens to cross the maternal-fetal interface. We review the processes, mechanisms, and potential consequences of dysregulation in all of the abovementioned phenomena. Basic information about exosomes and their roles in viral immune evasion is also presented. The interactions between extracellular vesicles and bacteria, fungi, parasites and proteinaceous infectious agents are addressed. The discovery of the placental microbiota and the implications of this new microbiota are also discussed, and current proposals that explain fetal/placental  by both pathogenic and commensal microbes are addressed. The comprehension of such interactions will help us to understand the immune dynamics of human pregnancy and the mechanisms of immune evasion used by different pathogens.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600299>Synbiotic supplementation to decrease Salmonella  in the intestine and carcass contamination in broiler birds.</a></h1><p>In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to study the effects of synbiotic supplementation on Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis (SE) proliferation, cecal content load, and broiler carcass contamination. Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus faecium, Bifidobacterium animalis, and Pediococcus acidilactici culture supernatants decreased (P < 0.05) the in vitro proliferation of SE at 1:1 supernatant: pathogen dilution. A total of 240 Cobb-500 broiler chicks were randomly allotted to three treatment groups (8 replicates/group with 10 birds/replicate): control (basal diet), antibiotic (Virginiamycin at 20 mg/kg feed), synbiotic (PoultryStar® ME at 0. g/kg feed containing L. reuteri, E. faecium, B. animalis, P. acidilactici and a Fructooligosaccharide) from day of hatch. At 21 d of age, all birds in experimental groups were orally inoculated with 250 μl of 1 X 109 CFU SE. Antibiotic supplementation increased (P < 0.05) body weight and feed consumption, compared to the control group. Birds in the synbiotic supplementation had intermediate body weight and feed consumption that were not significantly different from both the control and antibiotic group at 42 d of age in SE infected birds. No significant effects were observed in feed efficiency at 42 d of age among the groups. Antibiotic and synbiotic supplementation decreased (P < 0.05) SE load in cecal contents by 0.90 and 0.85 log units/ g and carcass SE load by 1.4 and 1. log units/mL of rinsate compared to the control group at 42 d of age (21 dpi). The relative abundance of IL-10, IL-1, TLR-4, and IFNγ mRNA was decreased (P < 0.05) in the antibiotic and synbiotic supplementation groups compared to the control birds at 42 d of age (21 dpi).

However, limited  rates have been reported in many clinical trials. The aim of this pilot clinical study was to evaluate the  efficiency of Streptococcus dentisani under different dosing schedules and pre-treatment conditions. Eleven adult volunteers enrolled in the study. A professional ultrasound cleaning was performed in quadrants 1 and 4. The probiotic was applied in all four quadrants at a total dose of 10 CFUs, administered in a buccoadhesive gel for  min, either in a single dose (n = ) or daily for a week (n = 6). Dental plaque and saliva samples were collected at baseline and after 14 and 28 days of first application. Amounts of S. dentisani and the cariogenic organism Streptococcus mutans were measured by qPCR and salivary pH was measured by reflectometry. There was a significant increase in S. dentisani cells at day 14 but not at day 28 under both dosing schedules. A non-significant higher  was found in the half-mouth with previous professional cleaning as compared to the intact half. There was a significant increase in salivary pH at day 14 (p = 0.024) and day 28 (p = 0.014), which was stronger in multi-dose patients, and a significant decrease in S. mutans at day 28 (p < 0.01). The results indicate that S. dentisani is transiently able to colonize the oral cavity and that it buffers oral pH, especially after multiple dosing.

However, whether there is a synergistic effect between AMF and PSA in promoting plant growth and controlling disease is worth exploring. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of AMF and PSA on growth-promotion and controlling disease on Solanaceae vegetables and to obtain effective AMF+PSA combinations. Under greenhouse pot conditions, chili (Capsicum annu-um, cultivar: Yangjiaojiao) and eggplant (Solanum melongena, cultivar: Heiguanchangqie) were inoculated with or without AMF Funneliformis mosseae (Fm), Glomus versiforme (Gv), PSA Streptomyces globosus H6-1, Streptomyces rochei S2-2, Streptomyces coralus D11-4 or/and pathogenic fungi Botrytis cinerea. There were a total of 48 treatments. The growth, disease and root symbiont development of plants were determined. The results showed that Fm and PSA could promote each other's , while Gv and PSA inhibited each other. Compared with the control, AMF, PSA and AMF+PSA improved the photosynthetic performance, root activity, and growth of chili and eggplant. Under the condition of inoculation with pathogenic fungi, AMF and/or PSA treatment significantly increased growth and reduced the disease index of plants, with the effects of PSA being greater than that of AMF. Fm+H6-1 combination had the best effect on the growth-promotion and controlling disease of chili plants, with the controlling effect on gray mold reaching 69.1%. Fm+ D11-4 had the best effect on the growth promotion and controlling disease of eggplant, the controlling effect of which on gray mold reached 75.%. Fm+H6-1 andFm+D11-4 were efficient combinations of chili and eggplant for promoting growth and controlling disease under the conditions of this experiment.

Upon attachment to host cells, enteropathogenic  (EPEC) employs a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject into the host cells ∼20 effector proteins, including Tir. CesT, which is encoded from the same operon downstream of , is a Tir-bound chaperone that facilitates Tir translocation. Upon Tir translocation, the liberated CesT remains in the bacterial cytoplasm and antagonizes the posttranscriptional regulator CsrA, thus eliciting global regulation in the infecting pathogen. Importantly, tight control of the Tir/CesT ratio is vital, since an uncontrolled surge in free CesT levels may repress CsrA in an untimely manner, thus abrogating . We investigated how fluctuations in Tir translation affect the regulation of this ratio. By creating mutations that cause the premature termination of Tir translation, we revealed that the untranslated  mRNA becomes highly unstable, resulting in a rapid drop in  mRNA levels and, thus, CesT levels. This mechanism couples Tir and CesT levels to ensure a stable Tir/CesT ratio. Our results expose an additional level of regulation that enhances the efficacy of the initial interaction of EPEC with the host cell, providing a better understanding of the bacterial switch from the planktonic to the cell-adherent lifestyle. Host  by extracellular pathogens often entails the transition from a planktonic lifestyle to a host-attached state. Enteropathogenic  (EPEC), a Gram-negative pathogen, attaches to the intestinal epithelium of the host and employs a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the cytoplasm of infected cells. The most abundant effector protein injected is Tir, whose translocation is dependent on the Tir-bound chaperon CesT. Upon Tir injection, the liberated CesT binds to and inhibits the posttranscriptional regulator CsrA, resulting in reprogramming of gene expression in the host-attached bacteria. Thus, adaptation to the host-attached state involves dynamic remodeling of EPEC gene expression, which is mediated by the relative levels of Tir and CesT. Fluctuating from the optimal Tir/CesT ratio results in a decrease in EPEC virulence. Here we elucidate a posttranscriptional circuit that prevents sharp variations from this ratio, thus improving host .Copyright © 2019 Elbaz et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31524619>Enhanced biomass production and nutrient removal capacity of duckweed via two-step cultivation process with a plant growth-promoting bacterium, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus P23.</a></h1><p>Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) are considered a promising tool to improve biomass production and water remediation by the aquatic plant, duckweed; however, no effective methodology is available to utilize PGPB in large hydroponic systems. In this study, we proposed a two-step cultivation process, which comprised of a " step" and a "mass cultivation step," and examined its efficacy in both bucket-scale and flask-scale cultivation experiments. We showed that in the outdoor bucket-scale experiments using three kinds of environmental water, plants cultured through the two-step cultivation method with the PGPB strain, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus P23, yielded 1.9 to 2.3 times more biomass than the control (without PGPB inoculation). The greater nitrogen and phosphorus removals compared to control were also attained, indicating that this strategy is useful for accelerating nutrient removal by duckweed. Flask-scale experiments using non-sterile pond water revealed that inoculation of strain P23 altered duckweed surface microbial community structures, and the beneficial effects of the inoculated strain P23 could last for -10 d. The loss of the duckweed growth-promoting effect was noticeable when the  of strain P23 decreased in the plant. These observations suggest that the stable  of the plant with PGPB is the key for maintaining the accelerated duckweed growth and nutrient removal in this cultivation method. Overall, our results suggest the possibility of an improved duckweed production using a two-step cultivation process with PGPB.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this investigation was to promote the drought tolerant abilities in pigmented rice cv. 'Hom Nil' at booting stage using arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)-inoculation, mixed spores of ,  and  in the soil before rice seedling transplantation. At booting stage, the AMF-inoculated (+AMF) and AMF-uninoculated plants (-AMF) were subjected to control (well-watering; 46.6% SWC) and water deficit condition (14 days water withholding; 13.8% SWC).  percentage in the AMF-inoculated root tissues were evidently proved in both with and without water deficit conditions, leading to elevate total phosphorus in root and leaf tissues. Interestingly, sucrose and total soluble sugar concentration in the flag leaf were increased by .0 folds and 1. folds, respectively in the plants under water deficit (WD). Free proline was accumulated in flag leaf when exposure to water deficit, subsequently regulated by AMF-inoculation. Total soluble sugar and free proline enrichment in 'Hom Nil' was a major mode of osmotic adjustment to control osmotic potential in the cellular level when exposed to water deficit, leading to maintained photosynthetic abilities and growth performances. Concentration of chlorophyll b in AMF-inoculated plants under water deficit stress was retained, causing to improve chlorophyll fluorescence and net photosynthetic rate. Shoot height and number of tillers were significantly declined by 12.% and 11.6%, respectively, when subjected to WD. At the harvest, grain yield, panicle dry weight and fertility percentage of AMF-inoculated rice from WD were greater than those without AMF by 1., 3.9 and 2.4 folds, respectively. Cyanidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-glucoside concentrations in pericarp were enriched in the grain derived from AMF-inoculation with water deficit stress.

Here, we explored whether zeolite addition to soil and indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can reduce cadmium (Cd) uptake from soil by bread wheat. We conducted a pot experiment, in which the effects of indigenous soil AMF, zeolite addition, and Cd spiking to soil [0, , 10, and 15 mg (kg soil)] were tested. Zeolite addition to soil spiked with 15 mg Cd kg decreased the Cd uptake to grains from 11.8 to 8.3 mg kg and 8.9 to 3.3 mg kg in the absence and presence of indigenous AMF, respectively. Positive growth, nitrogen (N), and phosphorous (P) uptake responses to mycorrhization in Cd-spiked soils were consistently magnified by zeolite addition. Zeolite addition to soil stimulated AMF root . The abundance of AMF taxa changed in response to zeolite addition to soil and soil Cd spiking as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. With increasing Cd spiking, the abundance of Funneliformis increased. However, when less Cd was spiked to soil and/or when zeolite was added, the abundance of Claroideoglomus and Rhizophagus increased. This study showed that soil-indigenous AMF and addition of zeolite to soil can lower Cd uptake to the grains of bread wheat and thereby reduce Cd contamination of the globally most important staple food.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650915>Mesenchymal stem cells have significant anti-infective effect on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis vascular graft infections.</a></h1><p>This study aims to evaluate the effects of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) implantation on vascular graft infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) and compare with antibiotic treatment.Healthy adult 56 Wistar rats (age, over  months; weighing, 300-350 g) were divided into eight groups.

Groups 3 and 4 were defined as Dacron grafted and MRSE infected groups, treated with tigecycline and MSCs, respectively. Groups  and 6 were performed polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft and infected with MRSE. These groups were also administered tigecycline and MSC treatment, respectively. Groups 7 and 8 were infected with MRSE without graft administration and were also performed tigecycline and MSC treatment, respectively. Grafts and soft tissue specimens were collected at 13 days postoperatively. Colony counts of peri-graft tissue were performed. All samples were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the markers that determine stem cell activity.The overall success of the treatments was assessed by the number of rats with MRSE recurrence, regardless of graft used. The difference between the untreated group 2, tigecycline groups (3,  and 7) and MSCs groups (4, 6 and 8) were statistically significant. Success of MSC and tigecycline treatments was similar in Dacron, PTFE, and non-grafted groups. There was a resistance of MRSE infection in Dacron groups to MSC and tigecycline treatments. This was considered to be indicative of the susceptibility of the Dacron grafts to infection. However, there was no significant difference between group 2 and Dacron groups in terms of bacterial .

Further, fruit waxing is a common practice in wholesale cucumber to preserve the water content of fruit and prolong shelf-life, but its impact on epiphytic microbiota is not well studied. This study investigated the survival of Salmonella Newport and S. Javiana on the surface of six cucumber cultivars of varying surface morphology and the effect of fruit waxing on the persistence of S. Newport. S. Newport and S. Javiana were spot inoculated onto fruit of cultivars 'Marketmore 97', 'Patio Snacker' and 'Corinto' (varieties with trichomes or spines), and 'Bella', 'Pepinex' and 'Summer Dance' (glabrous or smooth varieties). Cucumbers were held at room temperature for 24 h before inoculated sections of exocarp were excised for enteropathogen enumeration. S. Javiana persisted at higher populations than S. Newport (1.0 and 1. log CFU g exocarp decline, respectively) after 24 h (P < 0.05). Fruit waxing lessened S. Newport population decline after 24 h on all cultivars tested (P < 0.01). While there was a ~2 log CFU g exocarp decline in populations on unwaxed cucumbers, the reduction on waxed cucumbers was ~1 log CFU g exocarp. A cultivar effect was also observed; 'Summer Dance' supported consistently higher and 'Corinto' and 'Marketmore 97' (though for S. Javiana only) consistently lower Salmonella levels. Cultivars with trichomes were associated with lower populations than glabrous cultivars (P < 0.05). Our data showed that Salmonella persistence on fruit differed for the two serotypes tested and that cultivar differences play a role in determining cucumber surface favourability for pathogen . Additionally, fruit waxing may elevate the risk of Salmonella persistence on cucumber.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To attach to intestinal cells ETEC express  factors, among them CFA/I, which are the most prevalent factors and are the archetypical representative of class  pili. The helical quaternary structure of CFA/I can be unwound under tensile force and it has been shown that this mechanical property helps bacteria to withstand shear forces from fluid motion. We report in this work the CFA/I pilus structure at 4.3 Å resolution from electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) data, and report details of the donor strand complementation. The CfaB pilins modeled into the cryo-EM map allow us to identify the buried surface area between subunits, and these regions are correlated to quaternary structural stability in class  and chaperone-usher pili. In addition, from the model built using the EM structure we also predicted that residue 13 (proline) of the N-terminal β-strand could have a major impact on the filament's structural stability. Therefore, we used optical tweezers to measure and compare the stability of the quaternary structure of wild type CFA/I and a point-mutated CFA/I with a propensity for unwinding. We found that pili with this mutated CFA/I require a lower force to unwind, supporting our hypothesis that Pro13 is important for structural stability. The high-resolution CFA/I pilus structure presented in this work and the analysis of structural stability will be useful for the development of novel antimicrobial drugs that target adhesion pili needed for initial attachment and sustained adhesion of ETEC.© Weili Zheng et al. 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670814>Longitudinal  With Streptococcus pneumoniae During the First Year of Life in a Healthy Newborn Cohort.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to characterize longitudinal  with Streptococcus pneumoniae during the first year of life within a community newborn infant cohort, and assess the relationship between antibiotic exposure and  with antibiotic-resistant organisms.During April 2013-February 2014, 326 infants were enrolled from an urban academic hospital well-baby nursery. At ages 4, 8, and 12 months, we collected antibiotic data, other exposure data, and nasopharyngeal cultures for pneumococcal isolation.Follow-up visits were completed for 211, 158, and 144 infants at ages 4, 8, and 12 months, respectively. By 12 months, 33% of infants attending the visits had ever been exposed to antibiotics, 67% if exposures to maternal antibiotics at birth are included. Pneumococci were isolated at 38/839 (4.%) visits from 38 infants, including one 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13) serotype (6A). There were 1 (0.3%), 15 (7%), 7 (4%), and 15 (10%) infants who were colonized at 0-, 4-, 8-, and 12-month visits, respectively. By age 12 months, at least 35 (11%) infants had ever been colonized. Sixteen isolates (42%) exhibited nonsusceptibility to at least 1 antibiotic. Infants with recent antibiotic exposure were not more likely to be colonized or to harbor nonsusceptible organisms.Within a hospital birth cohort followed in the community, pneumococcal  and related antibiotic resistance were lower than previously reported, likely associated with PCV13 use. Antibiotic exposure was not associated with subsequent  with resistant isolates. The influence of other environmental factors needs further study.© The Author(s) 2019.

In this way, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are known to have a strong antimicrobial activity, even at low concentrations, due to their ability to selectively destroy cellular membranes. In particular, in the field of dental medicine, the use of AgNPs in different kinds of dental prosthesis matrixes could be a fundamental tool in immunodepressed patients that suffer of different oral infections.

Eggs collected from field-collected gravid females were placed on 0.25% agar slants and given a diet of 1) nematodes (Panagrellus redivivus Linnaeus), 2) nematodes + lactalbumin and yeast (LY), 3) microbes from nematode medium, and 4) tap water (autoclaved). Complete larval development to adult stage occurred only in two treatments: 1) nematodes and 2) nematodes + LY. Culicoides stellifer larvae could not survive beyond 1 wk on a diet of microbes alone or in the sterile water treatment. Larval survival rates were high using nematode diet (79.2 ± 11.3% [mean ± SE]) but were slightly lower in the nematode + LY group (66. ± 19.6%). Larval stage lasted ~21 d in both treatments. Sex ratio of F1 adults was ~1:1 (M:F) using nematode diet but was male biased (~2:1) with nematode + LY diet. These findings collectively suggest that a microbial community is required for midge larvae, either to support invertebrate prey base or as a potential food source. But in the present study, the supplied microbes alone were not sufficient to support midge survival/development. It appears that other nutritional components may also be essential to support the larval survival/development of C. stellifer. Overall, a simple diet of bacterial feeding nematodes and their associated microorganisms can be used to rear C. stellifer larvae under laboratory conditions. However, captive mating in F1 adults poses a major obstacle for successful  of this species currently.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here we assess long-term hydrological partitioning and stream water chemistry over a 30-year period in a rural mixed land use catchment in northern Germany undergoing riparian wetlands and widespread re- by beavers (Castor fiber) along the river network. We used long-term spatially distributed stream discharge, groundwater levels and surface water quality data with a simple monthly water balance model, changes in the variability in discharge measurements, and statistical analysis of spatio-temporal changes in stream water quality to assess long-term changes. Water balance estimates indicated high proportions of evapotranspiration loss (~90% of total precipitation) and relatively low groundwater recharge (<% of total precipitation) prior to riparian rehabilitation in 2000. Increasing groundwater levels from 2000 to 2017 and the relatively linear nature of the catchment storage - discharge relationship, indicate a gradual increase in groundwater recharge (buts still <10% of total precipitation). Wetland rehabilitation, greatly enhanced by increasing beaver populations, resulted in longer water transit times in the stream network, less linear storage-discharge relationship and a loss of daily stream variability, increased DOC concentrations, isotopic evaporative enrichment downstream, and moderated stream temperatures. There was limited long-term water quality improvements from wetland rehabilitation on either nitrate or total phosphorus concentrations, with unchanged seasonal summer and winter peak concentrations for phosphorus and nitrate, respectively. This likely reflects the long-term legacy of fertilizer use on nutrient reservoirs in the catchment's soils, aquifers, and stream network. These long-term changes in hydrology and stream chemistry resulting from riparian rehabilitation and changes in agricultural management practices provide invaluable insights into catchment functioning and an evidence base for future planning in relation to long-term climatic changes.Copyright © 2019.

To mitigate these effects, pumas from Texas were introduced into South Florida to augment genetic variation in Florida panthers. In this study, we report a  puma genome assembly and annotation after resequencing 10 individual genomes from partial Florida-Texas-F trios. The final genome assembly consisted of ∼2.6 Gb and 20,561 functionally annotated protein-coding genes. Foremost, expanded gene families were associated with neuronal and embryological development, whereas contracted gene families were associated with olfactory receptors. Despite the latter, we characterized 17 positively selected genes related to the refinement of multiple sensory perceptions, most notably to visual capabilities. Furthermore, genes under positive selection were enriched for the targeting of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, degradation of mRNAs, and transcription of viral genomes. Nearly half (48.%) of ∼6.2 million SNPs analyzed in the total sample set contained putative unique Texas alleles. Most of these alleles were likely inherited to subsequent F Florida panthers, as these individuals manifested a threefold increase in observed heterozygosity with respect to their immediate, canonical Florida panther predecessors. Demographic simulations were consistent with a recent  event in North America by a small number of founders from South America during the last glacial period. In conclusion, we provide an extensive set of genomic resources for pumas and elucidate the genomic effects of genetic rescue on this iconic conservation success story.Copyright © 2019, G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647840>Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation and expression of GFP in Ascochyta lentis to characterize ascochyta blight disease progression in lentil.</a></h1><p>The plant immune system is made up of a complex response network that involves several lines of defense to fight invading pathogens. Fungal plant pathogens on the other hand, have evolved a range of ways to infect their host. The interaction between Ascochyta lentis and two lentil genotypes was explored to investigate the progression of ascochyta blight (AB) in lentils. In this study, we developed an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation system for A. lentis by constructing a new binary vector, pATMT-GpdGFP, for the constitutive expression of green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Green fluorescence was used as a highly efficient vital marker to study the developmental changes in A. lentis during AB disease progression on the susceptible and resistant lentil accessions, ILL6002 and ILL7537, respectively. The initial infection stages were similar in both the resistant and susceptible accessions where A. lentis uses infection structures such as germ tubes and appressoria to gain entry into the host while the host uses defense mechanisms to prevent pathogen entry. Penetration was observed at the junctions between neighbouring epidermal cells and occasionally, through the stomata. The pathogen attempted to penetrate and colonize ILL7537, but further fungal advancement appeared to be halted, and A. lentis did not enter the mesophyll. Successful entry and  of ILL6002 coincided with structural changes in A. lentis and the onset of necrotic lesions -7 days post inoculation. Once inside the leaf, A. lentis continued to grow, colonizing all parts of the leaf followed by plant cell collapse. Pycnidia-bearing spores appeared 14 days post inoculation, which marks the completion of the infection cycle. The use of fluorescent proteins in plant pathogenic fungi together with confocal laser scanning microscopy, provide a valuable tool to study the intracellular dynamics,  strategy and infection mechanisms during plant-pathogen interaction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551334>Porphyromonas gingivalis Tyrosine Phosphatase Php1 Promotes Community Development and Pathogenicity.</a></h1><p>Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in bacteria plays a significant role in multiple cellular functions, including those related to community development and virulence. Metal-dependent protein tyrosine phosphatases that belong to the polymerase and histindinol phosphatase (PHP) family are widespread in Gram-positive bacteria. Here, we show that , a Gram-negative periodontal pathogen, expresses a PHP protein, Php1, with divalent metal ion-dependent tyrosine phosphatase activity. Php1 tyrosine phosphatase activity was attenuated by mutation of conserved histidine residues that are important for the coordination of metal ions and by mutation of a conserved arginine residue, a key residue for catalysis in other bacterial PHPs. The  gene is located immediately downstream of the gene encoding the bacterial tyrosine (BY) kinase Ptk1, which was a substrate for Php1  Php1 rapidly caused the conversion of Ptk1 to a state of low tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of discernible intermediate phosphoforms. Active Php1 was required for  exopolysaccharide production and for community development with the antecedent oral biofilm constituent  under nutrient-depleted conditions. In contrast, the absence of Php1 had no effect on the ability of  to form monospecies biofilms. , Php1 enzymatic activity was resistant to the effects of the streptococcal secreted metabolites pABA and HO, which inhibited Ltp1, an enzyme in the low-molecular-weight (LMW) phosphotyrosine phosphatase family. Ptk1 reciprocally phosphorylated Php1 on tyrosine residues 159 and 161, which independently impacted phosphatase activity. Loss of Php1 rendered  nonvirulent in an animal model of periodontal disease. Collectively, these results demonstrate that  possesses active PHP and LMW tyrosine phosphatases, a unique configuration in Gram-negatives which may allow  to maintain phosphorylation/dephosphorylation homeostasis in multispecies communities. Moreover, Php1 contributes to the pathogenic potential of the organism. Periodontal diseases are among the most common infections of humans and are also associated with systemic inflammatory conditions.  and pathogenicity of  are regulated by signal transduction pathways based on protein tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.

Each patient in the probiotic arm was administered 2 sachets (9.0 × 10 live bacteria) twice daily for 2 months. The primary outcome was intestinal EPE eradication at the end of the 1-year follow-up, as shown by 3 consecutive negative EPE rectal swabs during the follow-up year. The per protocol follow-up for all patients was 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the initiation of the intervention. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: .In total, the target size of 80 patients were included.

Here we propose a model approach to evaluate environmental conditions and species features to predict niche changes in non-equilibrium contexts. It incorporates potentially range-limiting processes (fundamental niche), hence allowing for better predictions of range shifts, differentiation of analog and non-analog conditions between the native and non-native (invaded) ranges, and identification of environmental conditions not currently available but likely in the future. We apply our approach with the worldwide invasive slider-turtle .We estimated the native and non-native realized niches of  and built its fundamental niche based on key features of the turtle's temperature physiological tolerance limits and survival-associated factors. We next estimated response functions adjusted to the physiological predictor variables and estimated habitat suitability values, followed by a comprehensive set of analyses and simulations to compare the environmental conditions occupied by  (at its native and non-native ranges).Climatic space analysis showed that the 's non-native realized niche is 28.6% greater than the native one. Response curves showed that it does not use its entire range of temperature tolerances (density curves for native: .3-23.7 °C and non-native: 1.7-28.4 °C ranges). Whether considering the mean temperature of the warmest or the coldest quarter, it occupies a wider range of temperatures along its non-native distribution. Results of the response curves for worldwide (global) and across Mexico (regional) comparisons showed it occupies analog and non-analog conditions between its native and invaded ranges, exhibiting also unoccupied suitable climatic conditions.We demonstrate that  occupies a wider subset of its fundamental niche along its non-native range (within its physiological tolerances), revealing that the species observed niche shift corresponds to a different subset of its fundamental niche (niche unfilling). We also identified suitable environmental conditions, globally and regionally, where the slider turtle could potentially invade. Our approach allows to accurately predict niche changes in novel or non-equilibrium contexts, which can improve our understanding about ecological aspects and geographic range boundaries in current and potential invasions.©2019 Espindola et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600710>Mycorrhizal symbiosis down-regulates or does not change root aquaporin expression in trifoliate orange under drought stress.</a></h1><p>Arbuscular mycorrhizas absorb water from soil to host plants, while the relationship between mycorrhizas and aquaporins (AQPs, membrane water channel proteins, which function in water transport) in mycorrhizal plants is unclear. In this study, Funneliformis mosseae-colonized trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata) seedlings were grown in pots fitted with 37-μm nylon meshes at the bottom of each pot to allow mycorrhizal hyphae absorb water from an outer beaker. The expression of seven plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs) genes, six tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs) genes, and four nodulin-26 like intrinsic proteins (NIPs) genes were analyzed in roots of both well-watered (WW) and drought stressed (DS) plants. The six-week DS plants dramatically increased hyphal water absorption rate by 1.4 times, as compared with WW plants. Mycorrhizal plants exhibited greater plant growth performance, leaf water status (water potential and relative water content), and gas exchange under both WW and DS conditions. Mycorrhizal inoculation induced diverse expression patterns in these AQPs under WW: up-regulation of PtNIP1;1, PtPIP2;1, and PtPIP2;, down-regulation of PtNIP1;2, PtNIP6;1, PtPIP1;2, PtPIP1;, PtPIP2;8, PtTIP1;1, PtTIP1;2, PtTIP1;3, and PtTIP5;1, and no changes in other AQPs. However, the expression of PtPIPs and PtNIPs was down-regulated by mycorrhizal inoculation under DS, and PtTIPs was not induced by mycorrhizal  under DS.

The ability of these fungi to infect insects as well as colonize plant roots is coupled in that EIPF can translocate insect-derived nitrogen from infected insect cadavers in the soil to the host plant in exchange for plant photosynthate. This symbiotic interaction offers other benefits to the plant; EIPF can improve plant growth, they are antagonistic to plant pathogens and herbivores and can enhance plant tolerance to abiotic stresses. The mechanisms and underlying biochemical and genetic features of insect pathogenesis are generally well established. However, there is a paucity of information regarding the underlying mechanisms in this plant symbiotic association.

In this study, we screened for MSSA and AMRB, especially for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) as well as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli. Potential risk factors for  with AMRB/MSSA and the potential effects of  with these on the obstetric population were investigated.From October 2013 until December 2015 pregnant women were screened before birth for  with AMRB/MSSA from the mammillae, nose, perianal and vaginal area. Before birth, the expectant mother was administered a standardized interview questionnaire by a trained interviewer. Data from the hospital admission records were also included.Samples from 651 pregnant women were analyzed.  with MSSA was detected in 14.3% (n = 93), AMRB in 3.% [(n = 23); MRSA: n = 3/ESBL: n = 20]. Significantly more  of AMRB/MSSA could be detected in women who had previously given birth compared to women who were nulliparous (p < 0.05). MSSA  was significantly associated with self-reported respiratory diseases during pregnancy (p < 0.05), but AMRB/MSSA  was not statistically associated with other types of infection.Our results demonstrate a low overall rate of  with AMRB/MSSA, as well as a low percentage of colonized pregnant women who developed infections. Multiparous women are at higher risk for  with MSSA/MRSA or ESBL. Because the prevalence of AMRB/MSSA is low, this study suggests that general screening of pregnant women without risk factors is not recommended.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31456074>Regulation of the leaf proteome by inoculation of Populus × canescens with two Paxillus involutus isolates differing in root  rates.</a></h1><p>During ectomycorrhizal symbioses, up to 30% of the carbon produced in leaves may be translocated to the fungal partner. Given that the leaf response to root  is largely unknown, we performed a leaf proteome analysis of Populus × canescens inoculated in vitro with two isolates of Paxillus involutus significantly differing in root  rates (65 ± 7% vs 14 ± 7%), together with plant growth and leaf biochemistry analyses to determine the response of plant leaves to ectomycorrhizal root . The isolate that more efficiently colonized roots (isolate H) affected 9.1% of the leaf proteome compared with control plants. Simultaneously, ectomycorrhiza in isolate H-inoculated plants led to improved plant growth and an increased abundance of leaf proteins involved in protein turnover, stress response, carbohydrate metabolism, and photosynthesis. The protein increment was also correlated with increases in chlorophyll, foliar carbon, and carbohydrate contents. Although inoculation of P. × canescens roots with the other P. involutus isolate (isolate L, characterized by a low root  ratio) affected 6.8% of the leaf proteome compared with control plants, most proteins were downregulated. The proteomic signals of increased carbohydrate biosynthesis were not detected, and carbohydrate, carbon, and leaf pigment levels and plant biomass did not differ from the noninoculated plants. Our results revealed that the upregulation of the photosynthetic protein abundance and levels of leaf carbohydrate are positively related to rates of root . Upregulation of photosynthetic proteins, chlorophyll, and leaf carbohydrate levels in ectomycorrhizal plants was positively related to root  rates and resulted in increased carbon translocation and sequestration underground.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552560>Off-host survival of Eriophyoidea and remarks on their dispersal modes.</a></h1><p>Dispersal of eriophyoid mites is crucial for the successful  of new plants. Literature suggests that their long-distance dispersal is through aerial transfer. During dispersal, eriophyoids might be captured in vapor or fine drops of water (perhaps most likely in clouds) where they might be protected against water loss and desiccation, but where they would have no food and be exposed to low temperatures and oxygen concentrations. Considerable resistance of these mites to these stressful environmental conditions is expected and has only partly been confirmed experimentally. The aim of the bioassays conducted here was to assess the survival of five eriophyoid species off their host plants, with poor oxygen availability under two temperature regimes. The bioassays were carried out on live mites dipped into two media used as microenvironments: (1) vaseline oil (used also as control treatment), and (2) water solution of Tween 80 (0.2%) and cycloheximide (50 mg/l). The bioassays were performed at  ± 1 and 25 ± 1 °C. The survival of mites was assessed weekly ( °C) or daily (25 °C) by counting live and active specimens. The following species were subjected to the bioassays: Aceria caulobia (a stem gall mite), Aceria ficus (a vagrant mite), Cecidophyopsis hendersoni (a vagrant mite), Colomerus vitis (protogyne/male population and deutogyne morphs; a leaf gall mite) and Phytoptus avellanae (a bud gall mite). The survival rate of the mites was higher at  °C than at 25 °C under both experimental conditions. At  °C, the survival of almost all species was higher in the water solution (up to 6-7 weeks) than in vaseline oil (3- weeks). Longer survival was found for A. caulobia and P. avellanae (gall-making species) than for C. hendersoni and A. ficus (vagrant species). As expected, the deutogynes of C. vitis survived longer than its protogynes. The current results suggest that individuals of some of the tested species are well suited for withstanding cold, starvation and low oxygen rates, which could be found at higher atmospheric layers, within the clouds, allowing them an effective long-distance dispersal.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609709>Use of impregnated catheters to decrease  rates in neonates - a randomized controlled pilot trial.</a></h1><p>Nosocomial infections increase mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. Central venous line  is a major risk factor for the development of such infections. In adults and children, antibiotic and antimycotic impregnated catheters have been demonstrated to reduce . However, recently published data showed no significant difference in bloodstream infection in neonates when an impregnated catheter was used. We investigated the effect of impregnation of percutaneously inserted micro-catheters (PICC) on  in preterm and sick term infants in our unit.Neonates were randomly assigned to receive either a standard (S-PICC; n = 34) or antibiotic and antimycotic impregnated (IP-PICC; n = 37) PICC. Catheters were placed and removed according to a standard procedure and subsequently examined by roll-out culture. The primary outcome was the rate of  defined as >15 colony-forming-units/ml. Additional outcomes were catheter associated or systemic infections.The rate of  was lower in neonates who received an IP-PICC as compared to S-PICC (.6% vs. 12.1% respectively; p = 0.42). However, the difference was not significant. In IP-PICC vs S-PICC, catheter related local infection (CRI) although lower was not statistically significant (2.9% vs. 6.1%; p = 0.60). We observed no difference in catheter related systemic infection (CR-SI) (0% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.48). The neonates whose catheters were colonized were predominantly of a lower gestational age (median 254/7, p = 0.05) and males (100%, p = 0.01). In addition, the median colony count in the colonized IP-PICC catheters was lower as compared to S- PICC group (53 vs 250, p = 0.06).The use of antibiotic and antimycotic impregnated PICC-lines in neonates tended to decrease  rates in neonates in our centers but this difference was not significant. Lower gestational age and male sex are risk factors for catheter .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496126>Longitudinal development of the gut microbiota in healthy and diarrheic piglets induced by age-related dietary changes.</a></h1><p>Diarrhea is one of the most common enteric diseases in young piglets. Diverse factors such as an unstable gut microenvironment, immature intestinal immune system, early supplementary feeding, and weaning often induce dysfunction of gut microbiota, thus leading to a continuing high incidence of diarrhea in piglets. However, few studies have characterized the gut microbiota of diarrheic piglets following changes in diet and during the development of intestinal physiology. In this study, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyze the dynamic establishment of fecal microbiota in six healthy piglets in response to age-related changes in the diet: sow-reared, early supplementary creep-feeding (sow-reared + starter diet), and weaning (solid nursery diet). We compared the gut microbiota of these six healthy piglets with those of diarrheic piglets during each of the three dietary stages (n = 10 sow-reared, n = 10 early supplementary creep-feeding, and n =  weaning). We found that weaning (solid nursery feeding) was the primary factor leading to dynamic  by microbiota in healthy piglets, and diarrhea primarily affected the microbial communities of piglets before weaning. Healthy piglets showed a continuous decrease in Lactobacillus and Escherichia, as well as a gradual increase in Prevotella with the transition to solid food. An altered relationship between Prevotella and Escherichia may be the main cause of diarrhea in preweaned piglets, whereas reduced numbers of Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Bulleidia, and Treponema that are responsible for the digestion and utilization of solid feeds may be related to the onset of postweaning piglet diarrhea. The Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) functional analysis indicated that a reduction in genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism induced by intestinal dysbacteriosis in diarrheic piglets was one of the major causes of diarrhea at the three dietary stages. These findings provide insights into developing an intervention strategy for better management of diarrhea in piglets.© 2019 The Authors.

SR piglets remained with the sows 24 h/d. FF and FP were fed formula or formula with galactooligosaccharide and inulin (4 g/L in a 4:1 ratio). CF and CP were sow-reared for  d and then rotated between the sow and formula-feeding every 12 h. Ascending colon contents were collected at day 21. The microbiota was analyzed by pyrosequencing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). VFAs were determined by gas chromatography.Distance-based redundancy analysis of DGGE and pyrosequencing data separated microbiota of FF from CF and SR. CF differed from SR by DGGE, but only a trend (P = 0.09) by pyrosequencing. Bacterial composition of CF was more similar to SR than FF. No bacterial genera in CF significantly differed from SR; however, 9 genera differed between CF and FF, including Lactobacillus, Clostridium XIVa, and Fusobacterium. VFA concentrations were similar between CF and SR, while isovalerate and isobutyrate were 2-fold greater (P  < 0.05) in CF than FF. Neither microbiota nor VFA profile was affected by prebiotic supplementation.Microbial  patterns and VFA profiles of CF piglets were more similar to SR piglets than FF piglets. Prebiotics did not affect piglet bacterial composition and/or VFA concentrations relative to the main feeding modes (FF and CF). Thus, partial exposure to breast milk can be beneficial for microbiota development of FF neonates.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636880>Retrospective Analysis of Microbial  Patterns in Central Venous Catheters, 2013-2017.</a></h1><p>This study was performed to provide epidemiological information on microbial  in central venous catheters (CVCs).CVCs submitted to Medical Microbiology Laboratory from January 1, 2013, through October 1, 2017, which met our criteria would be included for analysis. Quantitative culture was used for CVCs. The results of culture and related information on CVCs were collected and recorded in detail. The prevalence was calculated, and related factors were analyzed statistically.A total of 2020 CVCs were submitted for culture and eligible for analysis. Positive microbial culture occurred in 379 catheters with 18.7% (379 of 2020) prevalence of . There were 23 microbial genera and 45 organisms detected. Among the isolated organisms, there were 39 kinds of isolated bacteria and 6 kinds of isolated fungi.  (19.8%) predominated in total isolated microorganisms, followed by  (11.3%) and  (10.3%). There were no significant differences in isolated organisms and fungal species between different sexes (  = 2.365,  = 0.50). Conversely, there were significant differences in isolated bacterial and fungal species between different wards and years (  = 124.046,  = 0.000;   = 77.064,  = 0.000). A total of 107 (.3%, 107/2020) CVCs were associated with a diagnosis of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). The most common organisms in causing CLABSI were  (23.4%),  (13.1%), and  (12.1%).The prevalence of microbial  in CVCs is still significant and even has gradually changed over time. The study provides a new view of microbial  pattern in CVCs and a prevalence of CLABSI, which will facilitate catheter-related infection prevention and control in clinic.Copyright © 2019 Yu He et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31405202> (Orchidaceae) Seed Coat Restricts the Invasion of Fungal Hyphae at the Initial Stage of Fungal .</a></h1><p>Orchids produce minute seeds that contain limited or no endosperm, and they must form an association with symbiotic fungi to obtain nutrients during germination and subsequent seedling growth under natural conditions. Orchids need to select an appropriate fungus among diverse soil fungi at the germination stage. However, there is limited understanding of the process by which orchids recruit fungal associates and initiate the symbiotic interaction. This study aimed to better understand this process by focusing on the seed coat, the first point of fungal attachment.  seeds, some with the seed coat removed, were prepared and sown with symbiotic fungi or with pathogenic fungi. The seed coat-stripped seeds inoculated with the symbiotic fungi showed a lower germination rate than the intact seeds, and proliferated fungal hyphae were observed inside and around the stripped seeds. Inoculation with the pathogenic fungi increased the infection rate in the seed coat-stripped seeds. The pathogenic fungal hyphae were arrested at the suspensor side of the intact seeds, whereas the seed coat-stripped seeds were subjected to severe infestation. These results suggest that the seed coat restricts the invasion of fungal hyphae and protects the embryo against the attack of non-symbiotic fungi.</p></html>
