Its inhibitors may be applied to efficiently treat hyperpigmentation and are widely used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products, food supplements and insecticides. Previous studies have shown that heterocyclic compounds with an amino group can inhibit tyrosinase activity. The present study aims to evaluate the inhibitory effect of some novel 2,6-diamino-4-chloropyrimidine derivatives (1a-e) and 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine (2a-e) including bioactive aniline moiety on the activity of the mushroom tyrosinase.In practice, the azo salt was initially synthesized from aniline derivatives and combined subsequently with the 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine and 2,6-diamino-4 chloropyrimidine followed by crystallization. The structures of resulting compounds were confirmed by FT-IR, C NMR, and H NMR. The derivatives (0-100 µM) were evaluated for their inhibitory effect on tyrosinase activity using l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) as substrate.All compounds showed inhibitory effects against the activity of the enzyme. About 23.72-55.08% inhibition was observed in the presence of 30 µM of each compound. The IC values of the synthesized compounds were measured, and their inhibition properties were also visualized by zymography. Based on the results, the compounds 1a-e and 2a-e showed moderate inhibitory activities. Notably, pyrimidine derivatives 1a (IC=24.68) and 1d (IC=24.45) also exhibited similar inhibitory activities when compared with the positive control, kojic acid (IC=25.24 µM). Kinetic studies indicated that the type of inhibition was noncompetitive.All results suggest that pyrimidine derivatives, especially 1d and 1a, can be considered as safe and efficient tyrosinase inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652476>More Than Fever - Novel Concepts in the Regulation of Body Temperature by Thyroid Hormones.</a></h2><p>Thyroid hormone is well known for its profound effects on body temperature.

Despite the multiple roles of adipose tissue in maintaining systemic metabolic homeostasis, adipocytes are thought to be largely homogenous with only 2 major subtypes recognized in humans so far. Here we report the existence and characteristics of 4 distinct human adipocyte subtypes, and of their respective mesenchymal progenitors. The phenotypes of these distinct adipocyte subtypes are differentially associated with key adipose tissue functions, including thermogenesis, lipid storage, and adipokine secretion. The transcriptomic signature of "brite/beige" thermogenic adipocytes reveals mechanisms for iron accumulation and protection from oxidative stress, necessary for mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration upon activation. Importantly, this signature is enriched in human supraclavicular adipose tissue, confirming that these cells comprise thermogenic depots in vivo, and explain previous findings of a rate-limiting role of iron in adipose tissue . The mesenchymal progenitors that give rise to beige/brite adipocytes express a unique set of cytokines and transcriptional regulators involved in immune cell modulation of adipose tissue . Unexpectedly, we also find adipocyte subtypes specialized for high-level expression of the adipokines adiponectin or leptin, associated with distinct transcription factors previously implicated in adipocyte differentiation. The finding of a broad adipocyte repertoire derived from a distinct set of mesenchymal progenitors, and of the transcriptional regulators that can control their development, provides a framework for understanding human adipose tissue function and role in metabolic disease.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

As of October 22, 2019, 49 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and the U.S. Virgin Islands have reported 1,604 cases of EVALI to CDC, including 34 (2.1%) EVALI-associated deaths in 24 states. Based on data collected as of October 15, 2019, this report updates data on patient characteristics and substances used in e-cigarette, or vaping, products (2) and describes characteristics of EVALI-associated deaths. The median age of EVALI patients who survived was 23 years, and the median age of EVALI patients who died was 45 years. Among 867 (54%) EVALI patients with available data on use of specific e-cigarette, or vaping, products in the 3 months preceding symptom onset, 86% reported any use of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products, 64% reported any use of nicotine-containing products, and 52% reported use of both. Exclusive use of THC-containing products was reported by 34% of patients and exclusive use of nicotine-containing products by 11%, and for 2% of patients, no use of either THC- or nicotine-containing products was reported. Among 19 EVALI patients who died and for whom substance use data were available, 84% reported any use of THC-containing products, including 63% who reported exclusive use of THC-containing products; 37% reported any use of nicotine-containing products, including 16% who reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products. To date, no single compound or ingredient used in e-cigarette, or vaping, products has emerged as the cause of EVALI, and there might be more than one cause. Because most patients reported using THC-containing products before symptom onset, CDC recommends that persons should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC. In addition, because the specific compound or ingredient causing lung injury is not yet known, and while the investigation continues, persons should consider refraining from the use of all e-cigarette, or vaping, products.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31344430>Physiological concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate do not promote adipocyte .</a></h2><p>Previous work has demonstrated that ketogenic diets promote white fat ; however, the exact mechanisms underlying this phenomenom have yet to be elucidated. Recently, an in vitro study showed that supraphysiological concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) had a strong influence on the induction of adipocyte . On the other hand, concentrations in the physiological range, achieved through ketogenic diets and prolonged fasting produce values of 1-3 mM and 4-7 mM, respectively. Herein, we investigated the impact of physiological concentrations of βHB on metabolism, and the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and other  markers in adipose tissues.The effects of βHB on adipocyte  were investigated in vitro, using primary cultures of isolated visceral and subcutaneous fat cells and cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and in vivo.It was determined that βHB failed to induce changes in the oxidative capacity, citrate synthase activity or  gene expression patterns in isolated adipocytes, and did not exert a permissive effect on β-adrenergic agonist-induced . In addition, 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated following βHB treatment exhibited downregulated Ucp1 expression levels, a result that was recapitulated in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of Wistar rats after βHB salt treatment. Rats administered βHB salts also presented reduced brown adipose tissue UCP1 protein expression.The mechanisms underlying ketogenic diet-induced  of adipocytes are not known. The results from the present study indicate that physiological concentrations of βHB are not responsible for this phenomenon, despite the observed βHB-mediated downregulation of UCP1 expression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A tyrosinase inhibitor was purified from Camellia pollen using high-speed countercurrent chromatography and preparative HPLC and was identiﬁed as caffeine by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. It showed strong mushroom tyrosinase inhibitory activity with an IC of 18.5 ± 2.31μg/mL in a noncompetitive model. The caffeine did not interact with copper ions in the active center of the enzyme but could quench ﬂuorescence intensity and change the secondary conformation of this tyrosinase. A molecular dynamics simulation showed that caffeine bound this tyrosinase via Lys379, Lys 376, Asp357, Glu356, Thr308, Gln307, Asp312 and Trp358, thus changing the binding sites of L-tyrosine and the loop conformation adjacent to the active center. In vitro cell model analysis revealed that caffeine exhibited significant inhibitory effects on both intracellular tyrosinase activity and melanin production of B16-F10 melanoma cells in a concentration-dependent manner. These comprehensive results suggest that caffeine is a strong tyrosinase inhibitor that has the potentials to be developed as skin-whitening agents in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries or as anti- agents in food industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362192>Occurrence of acrylamide and other heat-induced compounds in panela: Relationship with physicochemical and antioxidant parameters.</a></h2><p>Panela is a natural, unrefined non-centrifugal sugar obtained by intense dehydration of sugarcane juice. Acrylamide, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and furfural were determined in 40 panela samples distributed as granulated and block according to the technological process. Colour, , moisture, water activity, pH and antioxidant capacity were also evaluated. Acrylamide ranged between 60 and 3058 µg/kg; granulated panela reporting the highest concentration (812 µg/kg) compared with block panela (540 µg/kg). The lower content in HMF and furfural, the intense dehydration, and the extensive darkening of granulated panela suggested the  reactions were boosted due to the application of more severe thermal treatments. Principal component analysis showed a significant relationship between the panela presentation and the concentration of the analysed compounds. Benchmark values considering both types of processes would help to establish mitigation initiatives in panela products. The chromatic parameter a* could be used as an indirect index of the acrylamide content in panela.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Impairment in the  process of subcutaneous tissues proposed to contribute to obesity pathogenesis. In the current study, we aimed to assess whether the expression of brown fat genes in subcutaneous tissues in obese patients is altered as compared to non-obese patients.Participants were recruited from patients undergoing general surgeries. At the same site of surgery, biopsies were taken from the abdominal subcutaneous tissues from each participant, along with a venous blood sample. The expression of BAT genes was measured using a real-time PCR method. Serum FGF21 was measured using an ELISA kit, and the serum blood lipid profile was measured using the Dimension VistaTM 1500 System.A total of 58 surgical patients was involved. A low expression of BAT genes was observed in the groups with higher body mass index (BMI) (< 30 kg/m) as compared to the groups with lower BMI (> 30 kg/m). The expression of CIDEA and CITED1 was significantly higher in the patients with normal weight as compared to obese ( = 0.01 and  = 0.02, respectively). A significant negative correlation was found between the expression of BAT genes and BMI in patients with BMI < 35 kg/m. However, the strongest negative correlation was observed in the expression of CIDEA ( = -0.5,  = 0.004), followed by TBX1 ( = -0.4,  = 0.01), CITED1, and ZIC1 ( = -0.4,  = 0.03). Whereas the correlation of UCP1 with BMI remained insignificant ( = -0.29,  = 0.08). When including patients with BMI > 35 kg/m, the correlation decreased and became insignificant ( = 0.08). No significant correlation was found between the expression of BAT genes and blood lipid profiles ( > 0.05). Serum FGF21 was positively and significantly correlated to the expression of UCP1 ( = 0.56,  = 0.02) and TBX1 ( = 0.62,  = 0.01), however, this correlation was missing in patients with severe obesity.Our data suggested that brown and beige genes expression in abdominal subcutaneous tissues is dysregulated in patients with obesity.

In this study, we used a DH line for QTL analyses, for the first time in a fruit tree, expecting it to simplify the analysis of the inheritance of quantitative traits and thus to enhance QTL detection power. Using an F population from 'Prima' × 'Apple Chukanbohon 95P6' (DH), we constructed a genetic map of 'Prima', and identified 19 QTLs for 13 traits. These QTLs had comparatively high LOD scores and explained a large part of the variation of the phenotypes. In particular, acidity, juice , and skin splitting clearly segregated at a 1:1 ratio, consistent with the segregation of the alleles at the detected QTLs in linkage group 16; these traits appeared to be regulated by single genes, despite general consideration that they are quantitative traits. Using this simple genetic composition of the F population, we concluded that the skin splitting of apple fruit has recessive inheritance, and that the allele for splitting is tightly linked with those for high acidity and low juice  in 'Prima'.Copyright © 2019 by JAPANESE SOCIETY OF BREEDING.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663251>Microbiome-immune-metabolic axis in the epidemic of childhood obesity: Evidence and opportunities.</a></h2><p>Obesity epidemic responsible for increase in diabetes, heart diseases, infections and cancer shows no signs of abating. Obesity in children is also on rise, indicating the urgent need of strategies for prevention and intervention that must begin in early life. While originally posited that obesity results from the simple concept of consuming more calories, or genetics, emerging research suggests that the bacteria living in our gut (gut microbiome) and its interactions with immune cells and metabolic organs including adipose tissues (microbiome-immune-metabolic axis) play significant role in obesity development in childhood. Specifically, abnormal changes (dysbiosis) in the gut microbiome, stimulation of inflammatory cytokines, and shifts in the metabolic functions of brown adipose tissue and the  of white adipose tissue are associated with increased obesity. Many factors from as early as gestation appear to contribute in obesity, such as maternal health, diet, antibiotic use by mother and/or child, and birth and feeding methods. Herein, using evidence from animal and human studies, we discuss how these factors impact microbiome-immune-metabolic axis and cause obesity epidemic in children, and describe the gaps in knowledge that are warranted for future research.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640715>Upregulation of FNDC5 gene expression in C2C12 cells after single and combined treatments of resveratrol and ATRA.</a></h2><p>Irisin is a newly discovered myokine that secreted from skeletal muscle cells. Several studies showed that irisin involves in thermogenesis and increases the expression of  markers such as uncoupling protein-1 that in turns induces the conversion of white adipose tissue to brown fat. Resveratrol (Res) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) can also upregulate the expression of thermogenesis genes. In the present study, the effects of single and combined treatments of Res and ATRA on fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5) gene expression was explored.The mouse myoblasts, C2C12 cells, were seeded in 6-well plastic plates and cultured in DMEM media. After differentiation, in a pilot study, C2C12 myotubes were treated with different concentrations of Res and ATRA for 12 h. The best result was obtained by treatment of 1and 25 μM of Res and 1 μM of ATRA. Then the main study was continued by single and combined treatment of these compounds at chosen concentration. After treatments, total RNA was extracted from C2C12 cells. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated by the cDNA synthesis kit and FNDC5 mRNA expression was evaluated by the real-time PCR method.The FNDC5 gene expression in C2C12 myotubes of alone-treated with 1 μM, 25 μM Res and 10 μM ATRA did not change compared to vehicle group. However, in combination-treated the expression of FNDC5 gene was significantly increased compared to vehicle group.This is the first evidence that Res and ATRA can regulate FNDC5 gene expression in C2C12 myotubes. More investigations are necessary to explore the therapeutic effects of these nutrients in obesity, diabetes, cardiac and neurovascular disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31530289>Cold-induced lipid dynamics and transcriptional programs in white adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>In mammals, cold exposure induces  of white adipose tissue (WAT) and alters WAT gene expression and lipid metabolism to boost adaptive thermogenesis and maintain body temperature. Understanding the lipidomic and transcriptomic profiles of WAT upon cold exposure provides insights into the adaptive changes associated with this process.Here, we applied mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to provide a comprehensive resource for describing the lipidomic or transcriptome profiles in cold-induced inguinal WAT (iWAT). We showed that short-term (3-day) cold exposure induces  of iWAT, increases energy expenditure, and results in loss of body weight and fat mass. Lipidomic analysis shows that short-term cold exposure leads to dramatic changes of the overall composition of lipid classes WAT. Notably, cold exposure induces significant changes in the acyl-chain composition of triacylglycerols (TAGs), as well as the levels of glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids in iWAT. RNA-seq and qPCR analysis suggests that short-term cold exposure alters the expression of genes and pathways involved in fatty acid elongation, and the synthesis of TAGs, sphingolipids, and glycerophospholipids. Furthermore, the cold-induced lipid dynamics and gene expression pathways in iWAT are contrary to those previously observed in metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative disorders, and aging, suggesting beneficial effects of cold-induced WAT  on health and lifespan.We described the significant alterations in the composition of glyphospholipids, glycerolipids, and sphingolipids and expression of genes involved in thermogenesis, fatty acid elongation, and fatty acid metabolism during the response of iWAT to short-term cold exposure. We also found that some changes in the levels of specific lipid species happening after cold treatment of iWAT are negatively correlated to metabolic diseases, including obesity and T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31429928>Escherichia coli "TatExpress" strains export several g/L human growth hormone to the periplasm by the Tat pathway.</a></h2><p>Escherichia coli is a heavily used platform for the production of biotherapeutic and other high-value proteins, and a favored strategy is to export the protein of interest to the periplasm to simplify downstream processing and facilitate disulfide bond formation. The Sec pathway is the standard means of transporting the target protein but it is unable to transport complex or rapidly folding proteins because the Sec system can only transport proteins in an unfolded state. The Tat system also operates to transport proteins to the periplasm, and it has significant potential as an alternative means of recombinant protein production because it transports fully folded proteins. Here, we have tested the Tat system's full potential for the production of biotherapeutics for the first time using fed-batch fermentation. We expressed human growth hormone (hGH) with a Tat signal peptide in E. coli W3110 "TatExpress" strains that contain elevated levels of the Tat apparatus. This construct contained four amino acids from TorA at the hGH N-terminus as well as the initiation methionine from hGH, which is removed in vivo. We show that the protein is efficiently exported to the periplasm during extended fed-batch fermentation, to the extent that it is by far the most abundant protein in the periplasm. The protein was shown to be homogeneous, disulfide bonded, and active. The bioassay showed that the yields of purified periplasmic hGH are 5.4 g/L culture whereas an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay gave a figure of 2.39 g/L. Separate analysis of a TorA signal peptide linked to hGH construct lacking any additional amino acids likewise showed efficient export to the periplasm, although yields were approximately two-fold lower.© 2019 The Authors.

"Sawi" fruit during cold storage.</a></h2><p>The pineapples were dipped in salicylic acid (SA) (2.5 or 5.0 mM) or methyl jasmonate (MeJA) (0.01 or 0.1 mM) for 1, 2, or 3 hr and then held at 13 ± 1°C for 10 days. The parameters were determined after left the fruits at 25°C for 2 days. It was found that, in the tissue adjacent to the core, 5.0 mM SA for 2 hr and 0.01 mM MeJA for 3 hr alleviated chilling injury (CI) and maintained color than other treatments. The MeJA immersions lowered CI score, electrolyte leakage, and malondialdehyde content greater than other treatments. SA and MeJA immersions retarded polyphenol oxidase activity, total phenols, and induced antioxidant activity during storage. In the pulp tissue, SA treatment increased ascorbic acid and total sugar contents, and MeJA immersions enhanced bioactive compound and antioxidant enzyme activities than SA immersion. Therefore, MeJA immersions could alleviate CI and enhance antioxidant better than other treatments of pineapples during cold storage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Postharvest immersion at the optimum concentration of SA or MeJA can be applied for commercial scale in order to alleviate chilling of "Sawi" pineapple fruit during storage. MeJA treatment enhances antioxidant activity and reduces internal  better than SA treatment in pineapple.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387040>Changes in activity, structure and morphology of horseradish peroxidase induced by cold plasma.</a></h2><p>Cold plasma is an emerging technology increasingly applied in the agri-food industry. For fruit and vegetables, enzymatic  is a common phenomenon, causing quality deterioration. The objective of this study was to illustrate the effect of microscale atmospheric-pressure plasma jet (µAPPJ) plasma on the horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Results showed that after plasma treatment for 10 min, the residual activity of HRP was decreased to around 17%, and modification of secondary and tertiary structures were confirmed. The atomic force microscope (AFM) analysis revealed that the aggregation of enzyme protein was enhanced with prolonging treatment time. It was concluded that the activity of HRP could be reduced with destruction of structures and deformation of microstructure induced by µAPPJ plasma. The current study attempted to provide new idea for inhibiting  enzymes of fruit and vegetables with plasma technology through deeper understanding of the interaction mechanism of plasma active species with enzymes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this perspective has been challenged by the observation that CH has diverse biological functions in animals, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptosis. Meanwhile, it has now been identified as a possible candidate of gaseous signaling molecule in plants, although its biosynthetic and metabolic pathways as well as the mechanism(s) of CH signaling have not fully understood yet. This paper aims to review the available evidence for the biological roles of CH in regulating plant physiology. Although currently available reports do not fully support the notion of CH as a gasotransmitter, they do show that CH might be produced by an aerobic, non-microbial pathway from plants, and plays important roles in enhancing plant tolerance against abiotic stresses, such as salinity, drought, heavy metal exposure, and promoting root development, as well as delaying senescence and . Further results showed that CH could interact with reactive oxygen species (ROS), other gaseous signaling molecules [e.g., nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen sulfide (HS)], and glutathione (GSH). These reports thus support the idea that plant-produced CH might be a component of a survival strategy of plants. Finally, the possibility of CH application in agriculture is preliminarily discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671737> Effects of a Chronic Pterostilbene Supplementation in Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet.</a></h2><p>Obesity and related comorbidities are a major health concern. The drugs used to treat these conditions are largely inadequate or dangerous, and a well-researched approach based on nutraceuticals would be highly useful. Pterostilbene (Pt), i.e., 3,5-dimethylresveratrol, has been reported to be effective in animal models of obesity, acting on different metabolic pathways. We investigate here its ability to induce  of white adipose tissue. Pt (5 µM) was first tested on 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes, and then it was administered (352 µmol/kg/day) to mice fed an obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) for 30 weeks, starting at weaning. In the cultured adipocytes, the treatment elicited a significant increase of the levels of Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1) protein-a key component of thermogenic, energy-dissipating beige/brown adipocytes. In vivo administration antagonized weight increase, more so in males than in females. Analysis of inguinal White Adipose Tissue (WAT) revealed a trend towards , with significantly increased transcription of several marker genes (, , , , , and ) and an increase in UCP1 protein levels, which, however, did not achieve significance.

Sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and gum Arabic (GA) or sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) powders were mixed at 1:1, spray-dried, and incubated at 60 °C and 76% of relative humidity from 0 to 72 hr. Sample infrared spectra were collected, and  degree, conjugation efficiency, and stabilization properties of the conjugates were analyzed by spectrophotometry, fluorescence spectroscopy, turbidity, and zeta potential measurements. Pairwise soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) models showed significant chemical differences among NaCAS-GA mixtures incubated for 0 (Control) and 16 hr, attributed to functional groups linked to different Maillard reaction products such as Schiff's base and pyridine compounds. Infrared spectroscopy combined with SIMCA is a powerful tool to monitor the formation of protein-polysaccharide conjugates by Maillard reaction. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Protein-polysaccharide conjugates obtained by Maillard reaction are currently used as novel food emulsifiers. However, conventional methods to study this chemical reaction are time consuming or involve the use of toxic and harmful reactants.

To the contrary, deficiency of an anti-oxidizing enzyme, glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-1, was reported to enhance insulin signaling, suggesting that oxidative stress may inhibit the development of type 2 diabetes. However, the beneficial effects of the absence of GPx-1 in metabolic homeostasis, including body weight control, have not yet been clearly manifested. To clarify the relationship between oxidative stress and obesity-related metabolic disorders, we investigated another mouse deficient with both GPx-1 and catalase (Cat).C57BL/6J wild-type and GPx-1 × Cat mice were fed with a high-fat diet (60% fat) or a normal chow diet for 16 weeks and were investigated for metabolic and histological studies.Body weight gain was significantly reduced, and glucose metabolism as well as hepatic steatosis was obviously improved in the GPx-1 × Cat mice.

The pathway generated 518.15 wRVUs, translating to $37,522. Procedures contributed the most revenue (342.27 wRVUs, $18,042), followed by E&M (124.23 wRVUs, $8,881), and diagnostic imaging (51.65 wRVUs, $10,599). Intervention patients accounted for 86.7% of wRVUs (449.48) and 80.0% of the revenue ($30,010). An average of 33 minutes (38.3 hours total) and 2.06 hours (36.8 hours total) were spent on E&M visits and procedures, respectively.In this collaboration between the wound center and IR undertaken to treat VLU, IR and E&M visits generated revenue and enabled procedural and downstream imaging revenue.Copyright © 2019 SIR.

Brown adipose tissue (AT) regulates energy expenditure through the activity of the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). White AT  is the process by which some adipocytes within AT depots acquire properties of brown adipocytes ("brite" adipocytes) and it correlates with metabolic improvement. We analyzed determinants of REE in patients with obesity and assessed  expression as a "brite" marker in abdominal subcutaneous AT (SAT) and visceral omental AT (VAT). Clinical data, REE, free fat mass (FFM), and fat mass (FM) were determined in 209 patients with obesity. , PPARG coactivator 1 alpha (), transcription factor A, mitochondrial (), T-box transcription factor 1 (), and solute carrier family 27 member 1 () expression was assayed in SAT and VAT samples, obtained during sleeve gastrectomy from 62 patients with obesity. REE and body composition data were also available for a subgroup of 35 of whom. In 209 patients with obesity a multiple regression model was computed with REE as the dependent variable and sex, waist, FFM, FM, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA), interleukin-6 and High Density Lipoprotein-cholesterol as the independent variables. Only FFM, FM and HOMA were independently correlated with REE ( = 0.787, AdjRsqr = 0.602). In each patient VAT displayed a higher , and  expression than SAT and  expression in VAT (-VAT) correlated with Body Mass Index (BMI) ( = 0.287,  < 0.05). Introducing -VAT in the multivariate model, we showed that FFM, HOMA, interleukin-6, High Density Lipoprotein-cholesterol, and -VAT were independent factors correlated with REE ( = 0.736, AdjRsqr = 0.612). We confirmed that REE correlates with FFM, FM and HOMA in a large cohort of patients. Our results clearly showed that -VAT expression was significantly increased in severe human obesity (BMI > 50 kg/m) and that it behaved as an independent predictor of REE. Lastly, we suggest that an increased REE and  in metabolically complicated severe obesity could represent an effort to counteract further weight gain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31355852>Elucidating the Regulatory Role of Melatonin in Brown, White, and Beige Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>The high prevalence of obesity and its associated metabolic diseases has heightened the importance of understanding control of adipose tissue development and energy metabolism. In mammals, 3 types of adipocytes with different characteristics and origins have been identified: white, brown, and beige. Beige and brown adipocytes contain numerous mitochondria and have the capability to burn energy and counteract obesity, while white adipocytes store energy and are closely associated with metabolic disorders and obesity. Thus, regulation of the development and function of different adipocytes is important for controlling energy balance and combating obesity and related metabolic disorders. Melatonin is a neurohormone, which plays multiple roles in regulating inflammation, blood pressure, insulin actions, and energy metabolism. This article summarizes and discusses the role of melatonin in white, beige, and brown adipocytes, especially in affecting adipogenesis, inducing beige formation or white adipose tissue , enhancing brown adipose tissue mass and activities, improving anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects, regulating adipokine secretion, and preventing body weight gain. Based on the current findings, melatonin is a potential therapeutic agent to control energy metabolism, adipogenesis, fat deposition, adiposity, and related metabolic diseases.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554095>A multivariate approach to evaluating the chemical and sensorial evolution of South African Sauvignon Blanc and Chenin Blanc wines under different bottle storage conditions.</a></h2><p>Volatile compound composition contributes to the aroma profile of wine and is susceptible to change due to oxidation which may occur during storage and transportation, especially at high temperatures. Changes in sensory attributes may also occur, altering the sensory profile of wine. Classical univariate analysis only looks at the deviations for one factor at a time and may overlook the overall effect of treatments. In this study, changes in South African Sauvignon Blanc and Chenin Blanc wine sensory profile, volatile and antioxidant-related parameters resulting from storage under different temperatures (room temperature, 15 °C and 25 °C) and durations (0, 3 and 9 months) were investigated using a multivariate approach. Bottled, unwooded wines of both cultivars from six wineries were used. As expected, the chemical evolution of the wines was characterised by increases in absorbance at 420 nm (), colour density and hue with prolonged storage at high temperatures. To be able to compare the evolution of the sample sets regardless of the initial (T0/control) wine profile and composition, multivariate regression analysis in the form of regression vector (RV) coefficients were used to assess the correlations in the sensory and chemical changes relative to the control in each set. Using Pivot©Profile for the first time in this type of stability assessment and applying a new algorithm for data handling in addition to the classical one, this study showed that prolonged exposure to higher temperatures resulted in the change from fruity to toasted aroma attributes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

SQA at 2.5 - 10 µM induced the differentiation of white adipocytes to beige adipocytes partially by increasing the mitochondrial density and the expression of beige/brown adipocyte markers. In addition, SQA activated lipid catabolic pathways, evidenced by the increased expression levels of perilipin, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1.

Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are the cornerstone in the management of schizophrenia. However, despite their efficacy in counteracting both positive and negative symptomatology of schizophrenia, recent clinical observations have described an increase in the prevalence of metabolic disturbances in patients treated with SGAs, including abnormal weight gain, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. While the molecular mechanisms responsible for these side-effects remain poorly understood, increasing evidence points to a link between SGAs and adipose tissue depots of white, brown and beige adipocytes. In this review, we survey the present knowledge in this area, with a particular focus on the molecular aspects of adipocyte biology including differentiation, lipid metabolism, thermogenic function and the /beiging process.Copyright © 2019.

The tyrosine phosphatases protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) attenuate leptin and insulin signaling and are elevated in the hypothalami of obese mice. We report that elevated PTP1B and TCPTP antagonize hypothalamic leptin and insulin signaling and contribute to the maintenance of obesity. Deletion of PTP1B and TCPTP in the hypothalami of obese mice enhances CNS leptin and insulin sensitivity, represses feeding, and increases , to decrease adiposity and improve glucose metabolism. The daily intranasal administration of a PTP1B inhibitor, plus the glucocorticoid antagonist RU486 that decreases TCPTP expression, represses feeding, increases , promotes weight loss, and improves glucose metabolism in obese mice. Our findings causally link heightened hypothalamic PTP1B and TCPTP with leptin and insulin resistance and the maintenance of obesity and define a viable pharmacological approach by which to promote weight loss in obesity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Age, race, household income, familiarity with smartphones, and self-control were associated with missing global positioning systems (GPS) coverage, whereas school day was associated with discordance between percent of time at home based on GPS-only versus recall-aided space-time budget data. Fatigue from protocol compliance increases missing GPS across the week, which results in more discordance. Although some systematic differences were observed, these findings offer evidence that smartphone-based GEMA is a viable method for the collection of activity space data on urban youth.© 2018 Society for Research on Adolescence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31405194>Effects of Moderate Chronic Food Restriction on the Development of Postprandial Dyslipidemia with Ageing.</a></h2><p>Ageing is a major risk factor for the development of metabolic disorders linked to dyslipidemia, usually accompanied by increased adiposity. The goal of this work was to investigate whether avoiding an excessive increase in adiposity with ageing, via moderate chronic food restriction (FR), ameliorates postprandial dyslipidemia in a rat model of metabolic syndrome associated with ageing. Accordingly, we performed an oral lipid loading test (OLLT) in mature middle-aged (7 months) and middle-old-aged (24 months) Wistar rats fed ad libitum (AL) or under moderate FR for 3 months. Briefly, overnight fasted rats were orally administered a bolus of extra-virgin olive oil (1 mL/Kg of body weight) and blood samples were taken from the tail vein before fat load (t = 0) and 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min after fat administration. Changes in serum lipids, glucose, insulin, and glucagon levels were measured at different time-points. Expression of liver and adipose tissue metabolic genes were also determined before (t = 0) and after the fat load (t = 240 min). Postprandial dyslipidemia progressively increased with ageing and this could be associated with hepatic ChREBP activity. Interestingly, moderate chronic FR reduced adiposity and avoided excessive postprandial hypertriglyceridemia in 7- and 24-month-old Wistar rats, strengthening the association between postprandial triglyceride levels and adiposity. The 24-month-old rats needed more insulin to maintain postprandial normoglycemia; nevertheless, hyperglycemia occurred at 240 min after fat administration. FR did not alter the fasted serum glucose levels but it markedly decreased glucagon excursion during the OLLT and the postprandial rise of glycemia in the 24-month-old rats, and FGF21 in the 7-month-old Wistar rats. Hence, our results pointed to an important role of FR in postprandial energy metabolism and insulin resistance in ageing. Lastly, our data support the idea that the vWAT might function as an ectopic site for fat deposition in 7-month-old and in 24-month-old Wistar rats that could increase their  capacity in response to an acute fat load.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31346792>Effect of natural antioxidants on lipid oxidation in mayonnaise compared with BHA, the industry standard.</a></h2><p>Mayonnaise is an oil in water emulsion (O/W) consisting 70-80% oil. Lipid oxidation is a major cause of quality deterioration in mayonnaise. The effectiveness of antioxidants in a hetrophasic systems is highly dependent on their polarity and partitioning properties.The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of a hydrophilic [green tea extract (GTE)] and a lipophilic [tocopherol mixture (TOC)] and BHA on lipid oxidation in mayonnaise during 60 days of storage at 38 °C and to examine the interactions between GTE and TOC, to determine possible synergistic or antagonistic effects in antioxidant activity.The oxidative stability was studied by measuring hydroperoxides, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and colour of mayonnaise during storage. Comprehensive analysis of VOCs was done by static headspace extraction and separation by two-dimensional gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry. Sensory analysis was also carried out to study the effect of storage time and antioxidant type on sensory properties of mayonnaise and to investigate the predictive ability of volatile compounds for sensory terms.Addition of GTE (500 ppm) and TOC (500 ppm) increased the formation of hydroperoxides and certain VOCs. The combination of GTE with TOC improved the antioxidant efficacy compared to the individual extracts. However, sensory evaluation demonstrated that GTE promoted the development of unpleasant fishy and rancid aroma. The volatile compound methional, was significantly and positively correlated with fishy and rancid flavour. Regarding colour analysis, GTE showed the highest increase in darkening and  during storage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550180>Stimulation of histamine H4 receptor participates in cold-induced  of subcutaneous white adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Although many studies have shown that histamine and its signaling regulate energy homeostasis through the CNS (central nervous system), its role in adipose tissues remains poorly understood. Here, we identified the HrH4 (histamine H4 receptor) was highly expressed in adipocytes, at a level higher than that of the other three receptors (i.e., HrH1, HrH2, and HrH3). The HrH4 expression in adipocytes responded to cold through thermogenesis and lipolysis, supported by results from both mouse and cell models. When HrH4 expression was knocked down in the scWAT (subcutaneous white adipose tissue),  and lipolysis effects triggered by cold were ablated, and the oxygen consumption was also lowered both at the normal and cold conditions. Moreover, mice exhibited browned scWAT, accelerated metabolic rates, and tolerance to hypothermia when 4MH (4-methylhistamine), a selective HrH4 agonist, was adjacently injected to the scWAT. Consistent with these findings, 4MH also triggered the  and lipolytic effects in cultured C3H10T1/2 adipocytes. Mechanically, we demonstrated that p38/MAPK and ERK/MAPK pathways were involved in these processes. In conclusion, our findings have uncovered an effective role of HrH4 in adipose tissue .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425292>Changes in Utilization of Bariatric Surgery in the United States From 1993 to 2016.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to obtain estimates of changes in perioperative outcomes and utilization of bariatric surgery in the United States from 1993 to 2016.Bariatric surgery has evolved over the past 2 decades. Nationally representative information on changes of perioperative outcomes and utilization of surgery in the growing eligible population (class III obesity or class II obesity with comorbidities) is lacking.Adults with obesity diagnosis who underwent primary bariatric surgery in the United States from 1993 to 2016 were identified in the National Inpatient Sample database. Estimates of the yearly number, types and cost of surgeries, patients' and hospital characteristics, complications and mortality rates were obtained. Prevalence of obesity and comorbidities were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and changes in utilization of surgery were estimated.An estimated 1,903,273 patients underwent bariatric surgery in the United States between 1993 and 2016. Mean age was 43.9 years (79.9% women, 70.9% white race, 70.7% commercial insurance); these and other characteristics changed over time. Surgeries were exclusively open operations in 1993 (n = 8,631; gastric bypass and vertical banded gastroplasty, 49% each) and 98% laparoscopic (n = 162,969; 69.8% sleeve gastrectomy and 27.8% gastric bypass) in 2016. Complication and mortality rates peaked in 1998 (11.7% and 1%) and progressively decreased to 1.4% and 0.04% in 2016. Utilization increased from 0.07% in 1993 to 0.62% in 2004 and remained low at 0.5% in 2016.Perioperative safety of bariatric surgery improved over the last quarter-century. Despite growth in number of surgeries, utilization has only marginally increased.

Recently, a new type of adipocyte beige cells, involved in so-called white adipocyte tissue (WAT) , has received much attention as a target for adaptive thermogenesis. To clarify the relationship between adipocyte hypertrophy suppression and beige cells involved in thermogenesis, we examined the effect of trehalose on the changes in beige adipocytes in mice under normal dietary conditions.Mice fed a normal diet were administered water containing 0.3% (W/V) trehalose for 16 weeks, 0.3% (W/V) maltose, or water without saccharide (controls). Body temperature and non-fasting blood glucose levels were measured every 3 weeks. After 16 weeks of these treatments, mesenteric and inguinal adipose tissues were collected for measuring adipocyte size, counting the number of UCP1 positive cells by image analysis, and preparing mRNA to analyze beige adipocyte-related gene expression.Mice administered a continuous intake of trehalose exhibited a thermogenic ability as represented by an increase in rectal temperature, which was maintained at a relatively high level from 3 to 9 weeks and was significantly higher at 15 weeks in comparison with that of the maltose group. In addition to the reduced hypertrophy of mesenteric and inguinal adipose tissues, the trehalose group showed a significant increase in the rates of beige adipocytes in each WAT in comparison with those of the maltose and the water groups. Interestingly, a negative correlation was found between the mean cell sizes of adipocytes and the rates of beige adipocytes in the WAT. Furthermore, real-time PCR showed that the expression of  and  mRNAs, which are markers for beige adipocytes in the inguinal adipose tissue, increased in the trehalose group.Continuous administration of trehalose to mice fed a normal diet induced WAT  accompanied by suppression of white adipocyte hypertrophy, elevated body temperature and decreased blood glucose levels, which resulted in enhancement of energy metabolism. Therefore, we propose trehalose as a new type of thermogenic dietary component to prevent obesity by promoting WAT .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31382316>Professor Hal Kendig's Legacy: A fierce advocate for the rights and contributions of older people.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31429090>MicroRNA528, a hub regulator modulating ROS homeostasis via targeting of a diverse set of genes encoding copper-containing proteins in monocots.</a></h2><p>Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate vital cellular processes, including responses to extreme temperatures with which reactive oxygen species (ROS) are often closely associated. In the present study, it was found that aberrant temperatures caused extensive changes in abundance to numerous miRNAs in banana fruit, especially the copper (Cu)-associated miRNAs. Among them, miR528 was significantly downregulated under cold stress and it was found to target genes encoding polyphenol oxidase (PPO), different from those identified in rice and maize. Expression of PPO genes was upregulated by > 100-fold in cold conditions, leading to ROS surge and subsequent peel  of banana fruit. Extensive comparative genomic analyses revealed that the monocot-specific miR528 can potentially target a large collection of genes encoding Cu-containing proteins. Most of them are actively involved in cellular ROS metabolism, including not only ROS generating oxidases, but also ROS scavenging enzymes. It also was demonstrated that miR528 has evolved a distinct preference of target genes in different monocots, with its target site varying in position among/within gene families, implying a highly dynamic process of target gene diversification. Its broad capacity to target genes encoding Cu-containing protein implicates miR528 as a key regulator for modulating the cellular ROS homeostasis in monocots.© 2019 The Authors.

Hair cortisol may be a useful biomarker as it is a retrospective and longer-term measure of the mean cortisol level. However, studies have yet to examine the relationships between hair cortisol and depressive symptoms in samples of youth, and findings with adult samples are mixed. This study examined hair cortisol as a predictor of depressive symptoms, including the potential for nonlinear relationships.A representative community sample of 432 adolescents aged 11 to 17 years was examined. Depressive symptoms were measured using a 9-item short-form of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale. Hair was cut from the posterior vertex region of the scalp using thinning shears. Hair was washed, minced, ground and assayed with Salimetrics® Cortisol Enzyme Immunoassay Kit. Hair cortisol levels were logged for statistical analysis.In multivariable regression analysis, no significant linear relationship was found in model 1 between hair cortisol and depressive symptoms (b= -0.036, se = 0.02, p = 0.13). In model 2, a marginally significant linear association (b= -0.044, se = 0.02, p-value = 0.06) and a significant curvilinear relationship (b = 0.039, se = 0.01, p-value = 0.005) were found between hair cortisol and depressive symptoms. The results were graphed depicting a u-shaped curve such that hair cortisol levels on the lower and higher end of the distribution predicted depressive symptoms.The findings highlight the need to consider investigation of nonlinear associations between cortisol and depressive symptoms. Longitudinal mechanistic research is needed to elucidate the causal relationships between hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation and depressive symptoms as well as a better understanding of the biological mechanisms through which cortisol may contribute to depressive symptoms and psychopathology.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In some fruit, such as tomato, higher anthocyanin concentrations enhance storage and shelf life. In contrast, highly anthocyanic red-fleshed apples ( x ) have an increased incidence of internal browning flesh disorder (IBFD). To determine the mechanisms underlying this, 'Royal Gala' cultivar apples over-expressing the anthocyanin-related transcription factor (TF) MYB10 (35S:MYB10), which produces fruit with highly pigmented flesh, were compared with standard 'Royal Gala' Wild Type (WT) grown under the same conditions. We saw no incidence of IBFD in WT 'Royal Gala' but the over-expression of MYB10 in the same genetic background resulted in a high rate of IBDF. We assessed concentrations of potential substrates for IBDF and a comparison of metabolites in these apples showed that anthocyanins, chlorogenic acid, pro-cyanidins, flavon-3-ols, and quercetin were all higher in the MYB10 lines. For the flavol-3-ols sub-group, epicatechin rather than catechin was elevated in MYB10 lines compared with the control fruit. Internal ethylene concentrations were measured throughout fruit development and were significantly higher in 35S:MYB10 lines, and ethylene was detected at an earlier developmental stage pre-harvest. Expression analysis of key genes associated with ethylene biosynthesis (aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase and oxidase;  and ) and polyphenol oxidase () showed the potential for increased ethylene production and the mechanism for enhanced PPO-mediated browning. The expression of a transcription factor of the ethylene response factor (ERF) class, , was elevated in red flesh. Analysis of transcriptional activation by MYB10 showed that this transcription factor could activate the expression of apple , , and  genes. Our data show a link between the elevation of anthocyanin-related transcription factors and an undesirable fruit disorder. The accelerated advancement of maturity  premature ethylene induction has implications for the breeding and storage of these more highly pigmented plant products.Copyright © 2019 Espley, Leif, Plunkett, McGhie, Henry-Kirk, Hall, Johnston, Punter, Boldingh, Nardozza, Volz, O’Donnell and Allan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31361266>CE: Original Research: The Clinical Research Nurse: Exploring Self-Perceptions About the Value of the Role.</a></h2><p>: Background: Clinical research nursing is an emerging specialty practice.

An interview guide consisting of eight open-ended items was used. Data analysis used critical elements from Krueger's systematic steps for analyzing focus group data.Five major themes emerged from 168 coded statements contained within the focus group transcripts: comprehensive nursing care of research subjects, training and education of research subjects and staff, contributions to clinical science, unique combination of clinical and critical thinking skills, and CRN practice attributes. Subcategories were also identified. In general, participants felt strongly about the value they added.Clinical research nursing requires the use of a variety of abilities and skills, including critical thinking and problem solving, as well as clinical and research knowledge. The CRNs in this study described incorporating these and other elements into their practice, which they associated with their specialized role. The five themes that emerged help elucidate the importance and utility of including CRNs on research teams.The unique combination of applied research knowledge and expert clinical skills sets the specialty of clinical research nursing apart.

The influence of oxidation and reduction on juglone was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), as well as spectrophotometric based methods. The role of juglone in oxidation processes, as either an antioxidant in  reactions, was examined. These processes are characterized by a high chemical reactivity in redox. Juglone is irreversibly oxidized in at least one electrode step and reduced quasi-reversibly in at least three electrode steps. These results demonstrate that walnut genotypes have different radical scavenging powers.

Digital images were collected with video laryngoscopy before and after doxapram administration. Maximal inspiratory normalized glottal gap (GGA ) and laryngeal motion were compared between and within protocols before and after doxapram by using a difference of least squares mean.Normal laryngeal function was confirmed in all dogs with all protocols except propofol, which resulted in two false positive results. No difference between protocols was detected for predoxapram GGA . Postdoxapram GGA was greater than predoxapram GGA for all four sedation protocols (P ≤ .0030). Compared with propofol, postdoxapram GGA was greater for all three dexmedetomidine protocols (P ≤ .0420).Dexmedetomidine alone or in combination with opioids was an effective sedation protocol for laryngeal examination, producing sufficient immobilization to prevent jaw motion and without affecting arytenoid abduction.Dexmedetomidine sedation does not inhibit normal laryngeal motion.

These adipocytes express high levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and energy expended by generating heat. Thus, these are a potential target for the prevention or treatment of obesity. The present study involved a comprehensive analysis of the adipose tissue to understand the relationship between long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) 2310069B03Rik and UCP1. Cold exposure increased both  and  expression in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT). However, overexpression of lncRNA 2310069B03Rik suppressed the  mRNA expression and the promoter activity of UCP1 in the iWAT primary adipocytes. In addition, compared to the early induction of  expression by cold stimulation, the induction of lncRNA 2310069B03Rik expression was later.

In late August, CDC released recommendations for health care providers regarding e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI) based on limited data from the first reported cases (1,2). This report summarizes national surveillance data describing clinical features of more recently reported cases and interim recommendations based on these data for U.S. health care providers caring for patients with suspected or known EVALI. It provides interim guidance for 1) initial clinical evaluation; 2) suggested criteria for hospital admission and treatment; 3) patient follow-up; 4) special considerations for groups at high risk; and 5) clinical and public health recommendations. Health care providers evaluating patients suspected to have EVALI should ask about the use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products in a nonjudgmental and thorough manner. Patients suspected to have EVALI should have a chest radiograph (CXR), and hospital admission is recommended for patients who have decreased blood oxygen (O) saturation (<95%) on room air or who are in respiratory distress. Health care providers should consider empiric use of a combination of antibiotics, antivirals, or steroids based upon clinical context. Evidence-based tobacco product cessation strategies, including behavioral counseling, are recommended to help patients discontinue use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products. To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients who have been treated for EVALI should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products. CDC recommends that persons should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). At present, CDC recommends persons consider refraining from using e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain nicotine. Irrespective of the ongoing investigation, e-cigarette, or vaping, products should never be used by youths, young adults, or women who are pregnant. Persons who do not currently use tobacco products should not start using e-cigarette, or vaping, products.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427531>Site-specific impairment of perivascular adipose tissue on advanced atherosclerotic plaques using multimodal nonlinear optical imaging.</a></h2><p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), as a mechanical support, has been reported to systemically regulate vascular physiology by secreting adipokines and cytokines. How PVAT spatially and locally changes as atherosclerosis progresses is not known, however. We aimed to reveal the molecular changes in PVAT in advanced atherosclerosis based on multimodal nonlinear optical (MNLO) imaging. First, using an atherogenic apolipoprotein E knockout mouse model, we precisely assessed the  level of thoracic PVAT via a correlative analysis between the size and number of lipid droplets (LDs) of label-free MNLO images. We also biochemically demonstrated the increased level of brown fat markers in the PVAT of atherosclerosis. In the initial stage of atherosclerosis, the PVAT showed a highly activated brown fat feature due to the increased energy expenditure; however, in the advanced stage, only the PVAT in the regions of the atherosclerotic plaques, not that in the nonplaque regions, showed site-specific changes. We found that p-smad2/3 and TGF-β signaling enhanced the increase in collagen to penetrate the PVAT and the agglomeration of LDs only at the sites of atherosclerotic plaques. Moreover, atherosclerotic thoracic PVAT (tPVAT) was an increased inflammatory response. Taken together, our findings show that PVAT changes differentially from the initial stages to advanced stages of atherosclerosis and undergoes spatial impairment focused on atherosclerotic plaques. Our study may provide insight into the local control of PVAT as a therapeutic target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606590>Association between buprenorphine/naloxone and high-dose opioid analgesic prescribing in Kentucky, 2012-2017.</a></h2><p>Buprenorphine/naloxone treatment is a highly effective treatment for opioid use disorder decreasing illicit opioid use and both all-cause and opioid-involved overdose mortality. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between buprenorphine/naloxone prescribing and high-dose opioid analgesic prescribing (HDOAP) over time.This longitudinal study used 2012-2017 Kentucky All Schedule Prescription Electronic Reporting data and cross-lagged structural equation analysis. For each quarter-county observation, HDOAP rate (per 1,000 residents with opioid analgesic prescriptions) was used to predict buprenorphine/naloxone prescribing rate at the next quarter, and simultaneously buprenorphine/naloxone prescribing rate was used to predict HDOAP at the next quarter, accounting for baseline socioeconomic status, medical needs for opioid analgesics, and heroin availability.On average, HDOAP rates in Kentucky decreased by more than 10% (p < .0001) and buprenorphine/naloxone prescribing rates increased by more than 5% (p < .0001) per quarter over the study period. Every one-per-thousand higher HDOAP rate in an earlier quarter was associated with a 0.01/1,000 increase in the buprenorphine/naloxone prescribing rate in a later quarter (p = .009). Conversely, a one-unit higher buprenorphine/naloxone prescribing rate in an earlier quarter was associated with a 0.01/1,000 reduction in the HDOAP rate in a subsequent quarter (p = .017).Our results indicate a significant reciprocal relationship between HDOAP and buprenorphine/naloxone prescribing and a clinically meaningful effect of buprenorphine/naloxone prescribing on reducing HDOAP. Future studies on buprenorphine/naloxone treatment expansion should take into account this bi-directional association in the context of longitudinal data and evaluate for public health benefits beyond the reduction of HDOAP.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In that sense, the effects of a UV-C treatment (3 kJ m), compared with non-exposed beans (CTRL), were studied on the sensory and microbial quality, and bioactive and anti-nutritional content of fresh-cut faba beans (cv. ) during storage at 5 ℃. The effect of a domestic microwaving (3 min, 900 W) on bioactive and anti-nutritional compounds of fresh seeds prior to consumption at each sampling time was also studied. UV-C treatment extended the fresh-cut faba bean shelf life from 7 to 10 days with  score (the main sensory parameter adversely affected) of 8 and 1 log unit lower than CTRL at day 10. UV-C did not negatively affect the total antioxidant capacity of samples during storage. The phytic acid and raffinose contents decreased by 30/40%, respectively, after 10 days, without influence of the UV-C treatment. Microwaving reduced the phytic acid and condensed tannins contents by 30% in those samples stored for up to six days, with low microwaving effect in the last storage days.

Crystalline M1 phase of Mo-V mixed metal oxide is an excellent catalyst for this reaction. Here we show a hydrothermal synthesis method that generates M1 phases with high surface areas starting from poorly soluble metal oxides. Use of organic additives allows control of the concentration of metals in aqueous suspension. Reactions leading to crystalline M1 take place at 190 °C, i.e., approximately 400 °C lower than under current synthesis conditions. The evolution of solvated polyoxometalate ions and crystalline phases in the solid is monitored by spectroscopies. Catalysts prepared by this route show higher ODH activity compared to conventionally prepared catalysts. The higher activity is due not only to the high specific surface area but also to the corrugated lateral termination of the M1 crystals, as seen by atomic resolution electron microscopy, exposing a high concentration of catalytically active sites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31423095>Reversible signal transmission in an active mechanical metamaterial.</a></h2><p>Mechanical metamaterials are designed to enable unique functionalities, but are typically limited by an initial energy state and require an independent energy input to function repeatedly. Our study introduces a theoretical active mechanical metamaterial that incorporates a biological reaction mechanism to overcome this key limitation of passive metamaterials. Our material allows for reversible mechanical signal transmission, where energy is reintroduced by the biologically motivated reaction mechanism. By analysing a coarse-grained continuous analogue of the discrete model, we find that signals can be propagated through the material by a travelling wave. Analysis of the continuum model provides the region of the parameter space that allows signal transmission, and reveals similarities with the well-known FitzHugh-Nagumo system. We also find explicit formulae that approximate the effect of the time scale of the reaction mechanism on the signal transmission speed, which is essential for controlling the material.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408402>Fusarium Crown Rot Whitehead Symptom as Influenced by Wheat Crop Management and Sampling Date.</a></h2><p>Symptoms of Fusarium crown rot of wheat include premature death of inflorescens (whiteheads), lesions on subcrown internodes, and rotting of crown tissue and lower stem internodes. Each symptom type is influenced by a different set of environmental conditions. Whiteheads are the easiest symptom to quantify and are frequently reported in the Pacific Northwest U.S.A. The objective of this research was to examine factors associated with whitehead expression and relationships with wheat yield and test weight. Incidence of whiteheads differed for inoculations with different isolates of  and , and over years due to weather factors. Whiteheads became less as planting dates for winter wheat were delayed until after September, and incidence was increased with increasing nitrogen application rate. Dates of initial and greatest expression of whiteheads differed among cultivars, which was associated in part with the cultivar heading date. Whiteheads were not correlated with subcrown internode lesions or  of crown tissue. Whiteheads were also not correlated with grain test weight. Whiteheads were sometimes negatively associated with grain yield, but that relationship was variable and could not be considered a reliable, recurrent, or accurate measure of crown rot severity. These results indicate the need for caution in reporting whiteheads as a sole indicator of cultivar susceptibility to Fusarium crown rot.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427436>Taurine-mediated  of white adipose tissue is involved in its anti-obesity effect in mice.</a></h2><p>Taurine, a nonprotein amino acid, is widely distributed in almost all animal tissues. Ingestion of taurine helps to improve obesity and its related metabolic disorders. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the protective role of taurine against obesity is not completely understood. In this study, it was found that intraperitoneal treatment of mice with taurine alleviated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, improved insulin sensitivity, and increased energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis of the mice. Meanwhile, administration of the mice with taurine markedly induced the  of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) with significantly elevated expression of PGC1α, UCP1, and other thermogenic genes in iWAT.  studies indicated that taurine also induced the development of brown-like adipocytes in C3H10T1/2 white adipocytes. Knockdown of PGC1α blunted the role of taurine in promoting the brown-like adipocyte phenotypes in C3H10T1/2 cells. Moreover, taurine treatment enhanced AMPK phosphorylation  and , and knockdown of AMPKα1 prevented taurine-mediated induction of PGC1α in C3H10T1/2 cells. Consistently, specific knockdown of PGC1α in iWAT of the HFD-fed mice inhibited taurine-induced  of iWAT, with the role of taurine in the enhancement of adaptive thermogenesis, the prevention of obesity, and the improvement of insulin sensitivity being partially impaired. These results reveal a functional role of taurine in facilitating the  of white adipose tissue, which depends on the induction of PGC1α. Our studies also suggest a potential mechanism for the protective role of taurine against obesity, which involves taurine-mediated  of white adipose tissue.© 2019 Guo et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31507080>Signal regulatory protein alpha initiates cachexia through muscle to adipose tissue crosstalk.</a></h2><p>Muscle wasting from chronic kidney disease (CKD) or from defective insulin signalling results in morbidity and, ultimately, mortality. We have identified an endogenous mediator of insulin resistance, signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα), which leads to cachexia in mice and is associated with cachexia in patients with CKD.We assessed insulin signalling and mechanisms causing muscle atrophy plus white adipose tissue (WAT) metabolism in mouse models of CKD or acute diabetes (streptozotocin treatment). We then examined these factors in mice with global knockout (KO) of SIRPα and sought mediators of metabolic responses in muscle and adipose tissues of mice with either muscle-specific or adipose tissue-specific KO of SIRPα. Metabolic responses were confirmed in primary cultures of adipose cells.In mice with CKD, SIRPα expression was increased in WAT (three-fold, P < 0.05), and this was associated with precursors of cachexia: 'pathologic ', thermogenesis, and a two-fold activation of protein kinase A (P < 0.05 vs. control mice) plus loss of adipose tissue mass. In contrast, mice with SIRPα global KO and CKD or acute diabetes experienced improved insulin signalling and activation of pAkt plus 'physiologic ' of WAT. These mice avoided losses of muscle and adipose tissues and experienced a 31% improvement in survival (P < 0.05) than did wild-type mice with CKD. In muscle-specific SIRPα KO mice with CKD, we uncovered that serum SIRPα levels (P < 0.05) were suppressed and were associated with improved insulin signalling both in skeletal muscles and in WAT. These changes were accompanied by physiologic WAT . However, in adipose-specific SIRPα KO mice with CKD, levels of serum SIRPα were increased over two-fold (P < 0.05), while muscle losses were minimally inhibited. Clinical implications of SIRPα signalling are suggested by our findings that include increased SIRPα expression in muscle and adipose tissues (P < 0.05 vs. healthy controls) plus higher SIRPα levels in the serum of patients with CKD (2.4-fold, P=0.000017 vs. healthy controls).Our results show that SIRPα plays an important role as an anti-insulin mediator regulating pathways to cachexia. In muscle-specific SIRPα KO, changes in SIRPα serum levels seem to improve insulin signalling in muscle and WAT, suggesting crosstalk between muscle and adipose tissue. Therefore, targeting SIRPα may prevent cachexia in patients with CKD or acute diabetes.© 2019 The Authors.

Adipocyte-specific genes were observed using western blot, qPCR analysis and immunocytochemistry.Cardamonin treatment inhibited lipid droplet accumulation and reduced the expression of the adipogenic proteins C/EBPα and FABP4, and the lipogenic proteins LPAATθ, lipin 1, DGAT1, SREBP1, and FAS. Cardamonin also induced the expression of the  marker genes PRDM16, PGC1α, and UCP1 at the mRNA and protein levels, and induced mRNA expression of CD137, a key marker of beige adipocytes. It also increased the expression of the β-oxidation genes CPT1 and PPARα at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, cardamonin increased PKA phosphorylation and the mRNA and protein expression of the downstream lipolytic enzymes adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).Our findings demonstrate novel effects of cardamonin to stimulate adipocyte , suppress lipogenesis, and promote lipolysis, implying it may have potential as an anti-obesity agent.Copyright © 2019.

Based on the recent finding that casein kinase-2 (CK2) acts as a negative regulator of , new CK2 inhibitors were investigated as potential  agents. This led to the identification of clomiphene as a candidate. Clomiphene was found to inhibit CK2 activity with an IC of 2.39 μM. Accordingly, clomiphene increased mRNA and protein expression of  markers, including uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes and in murine primary adipocytes. In agreement with the increased expression of  markers, reduced lipid droplets, increased oxygen consumption rates, and mitochondrial biogenesis were detected after clomiphene treatment. Furthermore, phosphorylation of histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and 2, downstream mediators of CK2 actions, was decreased by clomiphene. On the other hand, CK2 overexpression diminished clomiphene-induced mitochondrial biogenesis as well as expression of  markers, suggesting that clomiphene-induced  is related to its inhibition of CK2. In vivo administration of clomiphene increased the mRNA expression of  markers in various adipose tissues, accompanied by reduced fat weights and body weights in mice. In summary, these data suggested that clomiphene induced the  of white adipocytes via CK2 inhibition, which may implicate it as a new anti-obesity drug.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, we characterized the metabolic phenotype of knockout (ko) and adipose tissue-specific (ako) -ko mice as well as NAA-supplemented mice on various diets. We identified an important role of NAA availability in the brain during adolescence, as 75% of -ko mice died on fat-free diet (FFD) after weaning but could be rescued by NAA supplementation. In adult life, NAA deficiency promotes a beneficial metabolic phenotype, as -ko and -ako mice showed reduced body weight, increased energy expenditure, and improved glucose tolerance on chow, high-fat, and FFDs.

Recent studies have shown that induction of brown-like adipocytes, also referred to as beige or brite cells, in white adipose tissue (WAT) results in the release of excess energy through mitochondrial heat production via uncoupling protein 1. This has potential a therapeutic strategy for obesity and related diseases as well as classical brown adipocytes. In our previous studies, we found that artepillin C (ArtC, 10 mg/kg body weight), a characteristic constituent of Brazilian propolis, significantly induced the development of brown-like adipocytes in inguinal WAT (iWAT) of mice. Furthermore, we recently demonstrated that curcumin (Cur, 4.5 mg/kg) also significantly induced the development of brown-like adipocytes in mice. The combined administration of several food-derived factors can enhance their bioactivity and reduce their required functional doses. In this study, we showed that co-administration of Cur and ArtC at lower doses (Cur, 1.5 mg/kg; ArtC, 5 mg/kg) additively induce brown-like adipocyte development in mouse iWAT. Moreover, this induction is associated with the localized production of norepinephrine following accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages in iWAT.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Younger harvested cassava roots, harvested at 300 days, are more tolerant to enzymatic . This appears to be in part due to enzymatic activity modulation of the SOD, CAT, and POD enzymes.

In this study, we investigated whether mitochondrial and cytosolic antioxidant-upregulated mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) delivery reduces oxidative stress and subsequently improves glucose tolerance, reduce systemic inflammation, and improves fatty liver disease in diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse models.Antioxidant genes Sod2 (mitochondrial) and catalase (cytosolic) or null (control) were upregulated in human adipose tissue-derived MSCs using adenoviral constructs. Modified MSCs were then delivered intraperitoneally into mice that were fed a 45% or 60% high-fat diet (HFD), and animals were followed for 4 weeks.Over 4 weeks, body weight remained stable; however, we noted a significant reduction in liver fat content by histological analysis and liver triglyceride assay. Triglyceride assay (p < 0.01) confirmed reduced liver fat accumulation in animals that received either Sod2- or Cat-MSCs. There was a lower plasma level of inflammatory marker TNFα, measured in mice that were fed either 45% or 60% HFD and received Sod2- or Cat-MSCs, indicating reduced systemic inflammation. Ucp1 mRNA was upregulated approximately 100-1000-fold for omental fat and 10-100-fold for pericardial fat compared to the Null-MSC-receiving group. Pcgc1a and Prdm16 mRNA upregulation was also noted particularly for pericardial fat. Glucose tolerance showed a positive improvement trend with a lower area under the curve (AUC) values for both Sod2- and Cat-MSCs groups in comparison to control. For mice fed with 60% HFD and that received Sod2-MSCs, glucose levels were significantly lower than control (*p < 0.05) at a time point of 60 min in the glycemic curve during glucose tolerance test.Reduction of oxidative stress post-antioxidant-upregulated MSC delivery, intraperitoneally, reduces systemic inflammation and fat accumulation in the liver. There is evidence of an increase in  of white adipose tissue depots with concomitant improvement of glucose tolerance in a weight-independent fashion. Antioxidant-upregulated MSC delivery may be a safe yet effective therapy for obesity and prediabetes and improves related complication such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401419>Effect of microwave blanching on antioxidant activity, phenolic compounds and  behaviour of some fruit peelings.</a></h2><p>Fruit peelings are increasingly being used as ingredients for the formulation of functional foods. In this study, the antioxidant activity and  behaviour of free and bound phenolic fractions of mango, apple, orange and banana peelings microwave-blanched at 720 W for 1, 3 and 5 min were determined. The fractions were equally analyzed for their phenolic content and composition. Generally, increased microwave blanching was accompanied by a significant increase of total phenolics content in free and bound fractions. Increased antioxidant activities at 3 and 5 min of blanching varied with the type of fruit peelings.  rates decreased with microwave blanching time except in the case of apple peelings. Epicatechin, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, p-coumaric acid and gallic acid were identified in fruit peelings. Generally, microwave blanching for 3 or 5 min was found to preserve antioxidant activities and reduce the  rate.Copyright © 2019.

Bacteria encode hundreds of transcription factors forming the base-level control of gene regulation. Moreover, highly homologous regulators are assumed to control conserved genes between members within a species that harbor the same genetic targets. We have explored this concept in 2  pathotypes that employ distinct virulence mechanisms that facilitate specification of a different niche within the host. Strikingly, we found that the transcription factor YhaJ actively regulated unique gene sets between intestinal enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC) and extraintestinal uropathogenic  (UPEC), despite being very highly conserved. In EHEC, YhaJ directly activates expression of type 3 secretion system components and effectors. Alternatively, YhaJ enhances UPEC virulence regulation by binding directly to the phase-variable type 1 fimbria promoter, driving its expression. Additionally, YhaJ was found to override the universal GAD acid tolerance system but exclusively in EHEC, thereby indirectly enhancing type 3 secretion pleiotropically. These results have revealed that within a species, conserved regulators are actively repurposed in a "personalized" manner to benefit particular lifestyles and drive virulence via multiple distinct mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

With parent-offspring trio analysis it is difficult to control for genotype error, and resolution is limited because each trio provides information from only two meioses. Inter-species comparison is difficult to calibrate due to uncertainty in the number of meioses separating species, and it can be biased by selection and by changing mutation rates over time. An alternative class of approaches for estimating mutation rates that avoids these limitations is based on identity by descent (IBD) segments that arise from common ancestry within the past few thousand years. Existing IBD-based methods are limited to highly inbred samples, or lack robustness to genotype error and error in the estimated demographic history. We present an IBD-based method that uses sharing of IBD segments among sets of three individuals to estimate the mutation rate. Our method is applicable to accurately phased genotype data, such as parent-offspring trio data phased using Mendelian rules of inheritance. Unlike standard parent-offspring analysis, our method utilizes distant relationships and is robust to genotype error. We apply our method to data from 1,307 European-ancestry individuals in the Framingham Heart Study sequenced by the NHLBI TOPMed project. We obtain an estimate of 1.29 × 10 mutations per base pair per meiosis with a 95% confidence interval of [1.02 × 10, 1.56 × 10].Copyright © 2019 American Society of Human Genetics.

This is still true, despite many authors having demonstrated that it is not a necessary component of welfare - some natural behaviors may decrease welfare, while some unnatural behaviors increase it. Here I analyze why this idea persists, and what effects it may have. I argue that the disagreement underlying this debate on natural behavior is not one about which conditions affect welfare, but a deeper conceptual disagreement about what the state of welfare actually consists of. Those advocating natural behavior typically take a "teleological" view of welfare, in which naturalness is fundamental to welfare, while opponents to the criterion usually take a "subjective" welfare concept, in which welfare consists of the subjective experience of life by the animal. I argue that as natural functioning is neither necessary nor sufficient for understanding welfare, we should move away from the natural behavior criterion to an alternative such as behavioral preferences or enjoyment. This will have effects in the way we understand and measure welfare, and particularly in how we provide for the welfare of animals in a captive setting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31490843>Increasing Access to Autism Spectrum Disorder Diagnostic Consultation in Rural and Underserved Communities: Streamlined Evaluation Within Primary Care.</a></h2><p>Preliminary feasibility and clinical utility research has demonstrated that implementation of a streamlined diagnostic model embedded within primary care (PC) clinics promotes early identification of young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Use of this model results in dramatically reduced waits for diagnostic consultation, high levels of family/provider satisfaction, and reductions in referrals to overtaxed tertiary diagnostic centers. The current study extends this work by providing data before/after implementation of a streamlined model across a diverse range of PC clinics that provide health care to rural and underserved communities.The streamlined assessment involved record/history review, diagnostic interview, standard rating scales, and an interactive screening tool. Eighty children between the ages of 19 and 47 months were seen across 5 different clinics. Data were collected through chart review.Implementation of streamlined model resulted in a significant decrease in latency to diagnostic conclusion from a mean of 144.7 to 49.9 days. Children were likely to experience a greater reduction in wait times if they were a PC patient versus a non-PC patient.Results show significant reduction in wait times for ASD diagnostic decisions across both PC and non-PC patients. By reducing waits and identifying concerns more efficiently, we may increase the ability of families to access early intervention and support services.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31477983>Effects of heat and shallot ( L.) supplementation on nutritional quality and enzymatic  of apple juice.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the effects of shallot ( L.) supplementation on improved nutritional quality and  index of apple juice, specifically by comparing between heated (96 °C, 30 min) and unheated apple juice. The results showed that total soluble solid, phenolic content, flavonoid content, as well as antioxidant activities of heated and unheated apple juice, significantly (< 0.05) increased with the increase in shallot supplementation (0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0%). The outcomes indicated that the nutritional parameters values for heated apple juice supplemented with shallot were greater than those of unheated apple juice.

However, the mechanisms of acute cold-stimulated beige formation still remain largely unknown. Here, transcriptional analysis of acute cold-stimulated (4 °C for 4 h) subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) was conducted to determine the molecular signatures that might be involved in beige formation. Histological analysis confirmed the appearance of beige adipocytes in acute cold-treated sWAT. The RNA-sequencing data revealed that 714 genes were differentially expressed (-value < 0.05 and fold change > 2), in which 221 genes were upregulated and 493 genes were downregulated. Gene Ontology (GO) analyses showed that the upregulated genes were enriched in the GO terms related to lipid metabolic process, fatty acid metabolic process, lipid oxidation, fatty acid oxidation, etc. In contrast, downregulated genes were assigned the GO terms of regulation of immune response, regulation of response to stimulus, defense response, etc. The expressions of some  candidate genes were validated in cold-treated sWAT and 3T3-L1 cell  differentiation. In summary, our results illustrated the transcriptional response of sWAT to acute cold exposure and identified the genes, including , , , and , involved in beige adipocyte formation in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31347616>Sourdough technology as a novel approach to overcome quality losses in sugar-reduced cakes.</a></h2><p>Sugar reduction in sweet baked goods is one of the most popular trends on the food market. However, reducing sugar without lowering the product quality with respect to sweetness, texture and microbial shelf life is challenging. Sugar alcohols are one group of sugar replacers which maintain the bulk and contribute to sweetness. Nevertheless, alternative approaches, particularly those that are seen as 'clean label', are highly demanded. Hence, the natural, in situ production of mannitol in a sourdough system was performed and its potential as a functional ingredient to improve the product quality of a sugar-reduced cake was investigated. A full sugar cake (C1), a 50% sugar-reduced cake with wheat starch (C2) or with commercially available mannitol (C3) were considered as controls. The substitution of sugar by wheat starch or mannitol caused lower specific volume (-15.5%; -10.7%), a harder crumb (+17.1 N; +4.4 N), less , a shorter microbial shelf life (-5.7 days; -4.3 days) and poorer sensory properties. The incorporation of sourdough in C2 improved the pasting properties by decreasing the peak viscosity. Moreover, it resulted in a similar specific volume to the full-sugar control, contributed to significantly softer crumb (-8.6 N) and increased  compared to C2. Sensory evaluation revealed an increased sweetness perception (+93%), aroma (+30%) and flavour (+25.5%) by the incorporation of sourdough. Although sourdough incorporation improved sugar-reduced cakes, the quality characteristics of the full-sugar control could not be achieved in this study. In conclusion, the addition of sourdough in amounts lower than 10% can be considered a useful tool to improve specific volume, crumb structure, colour, taste and flavour, as well as shelf life of sugar-reduced cakes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494615>The perioperative administration of dexamethasone and infection (PADDI) trial protocol: rationale and design of a pragmatic multicentre non-inferiority study.</a></h2><p>The intraoperative administration of dexamethasone for prophylaxis against postoperative nausea and vomiting is a common and recommended practice.

Adjusted odds ratios and analyses of covariance were used to examine associations between these factors at baseline.Health indicators in the cohort were comparable or better than in the U.S. and lifetime stress exposure was lower than among students from other majors. Exposure to more lifetime stressors was associated with greater risk for various health conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, and depression. Conversely, better social, environmental, behavioral, and personal profiles were associated with protective effects for the same health conditions.These data comprehensively summarize the lives of predominately Hispanic nursing students and highlight risk and resilience factors associated with their health and wellbeing. The findings are timely, as the nursing field diversifies in preparation to care for a diverse and aging population.

The dosage of PPL, the initial concentration of PAT, reaction temperature and time were investigated by batch experiments to study the optimal degradation condition. The concentration of PAT in pear juice was determined by high performance liquid chromatography with an ultraviolet detector (HPLC-UV). The results showed that the optimal condition was 0.02 g PPL/mL pear juice at 40 °C for 24 h. The content of organic acids, volatile flavor components, polyphenols, ascorbic acid and the degree of  reaction in pear juice, relating to the quality of juice, changed insignificantly. Although the initial PAT concentration was very high, the degradation product was confirmed nontoxic by cytotoxicity test of Caco-2 cells.

Nutritional interventions starting in the postweaning period may impact later life WAT health and function. We therefore assessed changes in mitochondrial density and function markers in WAT depots of young mice. Inguinal (ING), epididymal (EPI) and retroperitoneal (RP) WAT of 21, 42 and 98 days old C57BL/6j mice was collected. Mitochondrial density [citrate synthase (CS), mtDNA] and function [subunits of oxidative phosphorylation complexes (OXPHOS)] markers were analyzed, together with gene expression of  markers (). mRNA of ING WAT of 21 and 98 old mice was sequenced to further investigate functional changes of the mitochondria and alterations in cell populations. CS levels decreased significantly over time in all depots. ING showed most pronounced changes, including significantly decreased levels of OXPHOS complex I, II, and III subunits and gene expression of  (PN21-42 and PN42-98) and  (PN42-98). White adipocyte markers were higher at PN98 in ING WAT. Analyses of RNA sequence data showed that the mitochondrial functional profile changed over time from "growth-supporting" mitochondria focused on ATP production (and dissipation), to more steady-state mitochondria with more diverse functions and higher biosynthesis. Mitochondrial density and energy metabolism markers declined in all three depots over time after weaning. This was most pronounced in ING WAT and associated with reduced  markers, increased whitening and an altered metabolism. In particular the PN21-42 period may provide a time window to study mitochondrial adaptation and effects of nutritional exposures relevant for later life metabolic health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31361945>A Tyrosinase Inhibitor from a Nitrogen-Enriched Chemically Engineered Extract.</a></h2><p>The enzyme tyrosinase is involved in the biosynthesis of melanin and the enzymatic  of fruits and vegetables, and therefore, its inhibitors have potential to treat hyperpigmentary disorders or to function as food antibrowning agents.

The  factors that improve glucose uptake beyond normal levels are still unknown but glucose uptake is not affected in UCP1 knockout mice. Here, we demonstrate in human white adipocytes that basal/resting glucose uptake is improved by solely elevating UCP1 protein levels. Generating human white Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes with a stable knockout and overexpression of UCP1, we discovered that UCP1 overexpressing adipocytes significantly improve glucose uptake by 40%. Mechanistically, this is caused by higher glycolytic flux, seen as increased oxygen consumption, extracellular acidification and lactate secretion rates. The improvements in glucose handling are comparable to white-to-brown transitions, as judged by, for the first time, directly comparing in vitro differentiated mouse brown vs white adipocytes. Although no adipogenic, metabolic and mitochondrial gene expressions were significantly altered in SGBS cells, pharmacological inhibition of GLUT1 completely abrogated differences between UCP1+ and control cells, thereby uncovering GLUT1-mediated uptake as permissive gatekeeper. Collectively, our data demonstrate that elevating UCP1 levels is sufficient to improve human white adipocytes as a glucose sink without adverse cellular effects, thus not requiring the adrenergic controlled, complex network of  which usually hampers translational efforts.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Histopathology trainees as a group are likely to be at the forefront of this revolution, and have specific and as yet largely neglected training needs in this context. We designed an online survey for trainees within our region to capture their opinions and attitudes to digital pathology in the diagnostic setting, and to assess their perceived training needs. This survey indicates overall that these trainees have similar aspirations with regard to the predicted utility of digital pathology and the challenges faced as have been recognised among consultant histopathologists. While their training needs are also largely similar, there are specific additional considerations based around training in multiple centres with varying exposure to digital pathology.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

In contrast,  is one of the most strongly TZD-induced transcripts in human adipocytes, although not in cells from all individuals. Two putative PPARγ binding sites exist near the gene's transcription start site (TSS) in human but not mouse adipocytes. The -4 kb upstream site falls in a segmental duplication of a nearly identical intronic region +2.5 kb downstream of the TSS, and this duplication occurred in the primate lineage and not in other mammals, like mice. PPARγ binding and gene activation occur via this upstream duplicated site, thus explaining the species difference. Furthermore, this functional upstream PPARγ site exhibits genetic variation among people, with 1 SNP allele disrupting a PPAR response element and giving less activation by PPARγ and TZDs. In addition to this upstream variant that determines PPARγ regulation of  in adipocytes, distinct variants downstream of the TSS have strong effects on  expression in human fat as well as other tissues. A haplotype of 7 tightly linked downstream SNP alleles is associated with very low  expression and correspondingly high DNA methylation at the TSS.

Under-skin  symptoms develop after harvest upon the interaction of physical abrasion and physiological chilling stresses. Less understood preharvest and/or harvest factors may also influence fruit susceptibility to USB. In this study, we examined the impact of harvest time during the diurnal cycle and fruit sap components on USB development. Fruits were harvested at 4- to 6-h intervals, lightly abraded with sandpaper to simulate vibration damage during refrigerated road transport, held at 12 ± 1°C for 6 days, transported to the research facilities and ripened before USB assessment. Spurt and ooze sap from the fruit were collected at each harvest time. The samples were separated and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Fruit harvested at 10:00, 14:00 and 18:00 h had 3- to 5-fold higher incidence of USB than did those picked at 22:00, 2:00 and 6:00 h. Sap concentrations of the key aroma volatile compounds 2-carene, 3-carene, α-terpinene, -cymene, limonene and α-terpinolene were higher for fruit harvested at 14:00 h compared to those picked at other times. In the fruits harvested in the afternoon, abraded skin treated with spurt sap sampled at 14:00 h had 14.3- and 29.0-fold higher incidence and severity, respectively, of induced  than did those treated with sap collected at 6:00 h. The results showed that fruit harvested in the afternoon were more susceptible to USB than those picked at night or in early morning. The diurnal variation in fruit sensitivity was evidently associated with specific compositional differences in sap phytotoxicity. Topical application to the fruit skin of pure terpinolene and limonene resulted in induced USB damage, whereas pure carene and distilled water did not. Microscopy examination showed that while skin damage caused by pure terpinolene and limonene was not identical to USB per se, similarities suggested that sap components cause USB under inductive commercial conditions. Considered collectively, these findings suggest that night and early morning harvesting will reduce USB and thus improve the postharvest quality of Honey Gold mango fruit.Copyright © 2019 San, Hofman, Joyce, Macnish, Marques, Webb, Li and Smyth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605951>Liraglutide improves vascular dysfunction by regulating a cAMP-independent PKA-AMPK pathway in perivascular adipose tissue in obese mice.</a></h2><p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) attenuates its anti-contractile effect through an endothelial-dependent mechanism that aggravates endothelial dysfunction in obesity. The present study was conducted to explore whether liraglutide could improve vascular dysfunction, including the anti-contractile effect of PVAT and endothelial function, by modulating PVAT-related signaling pathways in obesity.C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal-chow diet or a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without liraglutide treatment. Vascular function of the thoracic aorta with or without PVAT were measured. Protein levels of components of the PKA-AMPK-PGC1α and antioxidant signaling pathway in PVAT were determined by western blotting. Brown adipose tissue-related gene in PVAT was measured by qRT-PCR.Metabolic profiles of HFD-fed mice were improved after treatment with liraglutide. Liraglutide improved PVAT-induced anti-contractile capability and PVAT-induced endothelial dysfunction in HFD-fed mice both in vivo and ex vivo. However, blocking PKA, or AMPK, but not cAMP, attenuated these beneficial effects of liraglutide. Treating HFD-fed mice with liraglutide activated the AMPK/eNOS pathway and induced -related gene expression. Moreover, liraglutide increased antioxidant capability. The protective effects were related to activation of a cAMP-independent PKA-AMPK pathway, as demonstrated by western blot and PCR.Liraglutide improved vascular dysfunction by modulating a cAMP-independent PKA-AMPK pathway in PVAT in HFD-induced obese mice. The findings provide a novel mechanism for the cardiovascular protection of liraglutide by modulating PVAT function in obesity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

Nutritious millet byproducts have a potential application in the development of functional cereal products, but require processing in order to improve their physical and nutritional quality. Therefore, we investigated high intensity ultrasound as a pretreatment to increase the amount of freely available bioactives from proso millet bran. We also analysed the effect of high intensity ultrasound on enzymatic , water retention and protein digestibility, which are crucial for the utilization in the bakery and pasta industry. A 15% millet bran suspension in water was treated with 400-W ultrasound probe for 5, 12.5 or 20 min, with the 60, 80 or 100% amplitude. High intensity ultrasound treatment with 80% amplitude for 12.5 min improved most significantly the nutritive value; the antioxidant activity measured by FRAP test increased by 15% (p<0.05), and total phenolic content by 16% (p<0.05). Still, the impact on the increase of water-soluble and ethanol-insoluble dietary fibre by 38% was evident after the treatment for 20 min at 100% amplitude. High intensity ultrasound treatment at 100% amplitude for 5 min caused the largest improvements in water retention and limited  of the sample. High intensity ultrasound treatment activated polyphenol oxidase, regardless of the applied heating of the sample. Due to its ambiguous impact on proso millet bran characteristics, the treatment required an optimization, which showed that the optimal pretreatment of a 15% millet bran suspension in water is at 100% amplitude for 9.3 min.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566484> Root Ethanol Extract Induces Lipid Excretion, Lipolysis, and Thermogenesis in Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>Adipocytes regulate lipid metabolism according to physiological energy requirements. A dysfunctional lipid metabolism can lead to obesity and its complications such as hepatic steatosis, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. In our study, the impact of  root ethanol extract (PGH) on lipid excretion and thermogenesis-related markers in diet-induced obesity mice was analyzed. Our data show that PGH elevated fatty acid uptake in epididymal adipose tissue by increasing  and  expression, which led to decreased blood free fatty acid concentrations. Moreover, PGH normalized body weight and fat mass in diet-induced obese mice by increasing lipolysis (, , and ) and fatty acid oxidation. Changes in the levels of -related genes, enzyme activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase, and the overall transcriptome (, , , , and ) led to promote brown adipose tissue-like features () in epididymal white adipose tissue and enhanced energy expenditure.

Patients gradually lose subcutaneous fat from the limbs, while they accumulate adipose tissue in the face and neck. Several studies have demonstrated that autophagy is involved in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and the maintenance of the balance between white and brown adipose tissue. We identified deregulation of autophagy in laminopathic preadipocytes before induction of differentiation. Moreover, in differentiating white adipocyte precursors, we observed impairment of large lipid droplet formation, altered regulation of adipose tissue genes, and expression of the brown adipose tissue marker UCP1. Conversely, in lipodystrophic brown adipocyte precursors induced to differentiate, we noticed activation of autophagy, formation of enlarged lipid droplets typical of white adipocytes, and dysregulation of brown adipose tissue genes. In agreement with these in vitro results indicating conversion of FPLD2 brown preadipocytes toward the white lineage, adipose tissue from FPLD2 patient neck, an area of brown adipogenesis, showed a white phenotype reminiscent of its brown origin. Moreover, in vivo morpho-functional evaluation of fat depots in the neck area of three FPLD2 patients by PET/CT analysis with cold stimulation showed the absence of brown adipose tissue activity. These findings highlight a new pathogenetic mechanism leading to improper fat distribution in lamin A-linked lipodystrophies and show that both impaired white adipocyte turnover and failure of adipose tissue  contribute to disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606690>Isolation of a tyrosinase inhibitor from unripe grapes juice: A spectrophotometric study.</a></h2><p>Grapes are known to contain high quantity of polyphenolic compounds, including caffeic, coumaric and ferulic acids esterified with tartaric acid, to yield caftaric, coutaric and fertaric acids, respectively. These acids are more abundant in unripe grapes, which can be processed into verjuice, a product that shows intrinsic resistance against microbial growth and significant antioxidant activity. In the present work, the isolation of hydroxycinnamoyl tartaric acids from unripe grape juice by chromatographic techniques was described. Moreover, the capability of caftaric acid to inhibit tyrosinase activity was evaluated by spectrophotometric assays. According to the kinetics parameters calculated, caftaric acid was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase, more potent than the related caffeic and chlorogenic acids, suggesting that it can be used in cosmetic and food industries for the development of natural skin whitening formulations and as an agent able to counteract the enzymatic  of food.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Remarkably, alpha-dicarbonyls and self-condensation products, fructosazine and deoxyfructosazine, were produced at this relatively low temperature. The presence of myoglobin shifted GlcN non-enzymatic  toward the formation of glucosone and fructosazine. When glucosone (250-2000 mg/L) was incubated with myoglobin it contributed to the formation of deoxymyoglobin, indicating its capacity to reduce metmyoglobin.

Nonetheless, the direct correlation between dietary AP and their effects in adipose tissues remained unclear. In this study, male C57BL/6 mice were fed with low-fat diet, HFD with or without 0.04% (w/w) AP for 12 weeks. Dietary AP ameliorated HFD induced body weight gain, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. Energy expenditure was increased with no influence on energy intake, which indicated us that AP prevented obesity by enhancing energy export. Interestingly, AP activated lipolysis (ATGL/FOXO1/SIRT1) without higher cycling free fatty acids (FFAs). FFAs were consumed by the upregulation of fatty acid oxidation (AMPK/ACC), thermogenesis, and  (UCP-1, PGC-1α). Additionally, adipose tissue metabolic inflammation (NF-кB, MAPK) was also reduced by AP. Our study proposed that dietary AP could be explored as a new dietary strategy to combat obesity and related insulin resistance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of wounding and subsequent application of a mild heat treatment were examined by monitoring the  potential (BP) and the activity of three -related enzymes (i.e., phenylalanine ammonia lyase [PAL], polyphenol oxidase [PPO], and peroxidase [POD]) during refrigerated storage up to 10 days. Efficient inhibition of  was achieved by treatment at 50°C for 60 s. The wound-induced increase of the BP and the activity of PAL and POD was effectively suppressed, maintaining their values at initial levels up to 7 days of storage. PPO activity, on the contrary, remained unchanged after wounding, whether or not followed by heat treatment. BP, PAL activity and POD were found to be strongly correlated, whereas meaningful associations for PPO with the other parameters could not be established. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In an attempt to answer to the growing demand in the fresh-cut produce industry to control , heat treatment was investigated as interesting alternative to chemical preservation methods. Efficient control of enzymatic  in fresh-cut Iceberg lettuce could be achieved by heat treatment at 50°C for 60 s. Experimental data are provided showing the effects of wounding and subsequent heat treatment on visual , the BP and the activity of PAL, PPO, and POD during refrigerated storage up to 10 days. Using this data, correlations were found for BP, PAL activity, and POD activity, but not for PPO. Although undesired side effects of heat treatment (e.g., tissue softening) cannot be excluded, the obtained information might be useful for further research, serving as a baseline for wound-induced effects on -related parameters in fresh-cut lettuce and possible mechanisms of action of inhibitory treatments.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31492869>Central nicotine induces  through hypothalamic κ opioid receptor.</a></h2><p>Increased body weight is a major factor that interferes with smoking cessation. Nicotine, the main bioactive compound in tobacco, has been demonstrated to have an impact on energy balance, since it affects both feeding and energy expenditure at the central level. Among the central actions of nicotine on body weight, much attention has been focused on its effect on brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis, though its effect on  of white adipose tissue (WAT) is unclear. Here, we show that nicotine induces the  of WAT through a central mechanism and that this effect is dependent on the κ opioid receptor (KOR), specifically in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). Consistent with these findings, smokers show higher levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression in WAT, which correlates with smoking status.

Understanding the neural basis of these effects may lead to greater precision for the development of future treatments. Task-related functional MRI (fMRI) after ABM training has not been investigated in depression so far. The main aim of this randomized controlled trial was to explore differences in brain activity after ABM training, in response to emotional stimuli.A total of 134 people with previous depression, who had been treated for depression and had various degrees of residual symptoms, were randomized to 14 days of active ABM or a closely matched placebo training, followed by an fMRI emotion regulation task. The training procedure was a classical dot–probe task with emotional face stimuli. In the active ABM condition, the probes replaced the more positively valenced face of a given pair. As participants implicitly learned to predict the probe location, this would be likely to induce a more positive attentional bias. The placebo condition was identical, except for the contingency of the probe, which appeared equally behind positive and negative stimuli. We compared depression symptoms and subjective ratings of perceived negativity during fMRI between the training groups. We explored brain activation in predefined regions of interest and across the whole brain. We explored activation in areas associated with changes in attentional bias
and degree of depression.Compared with the placebo group, the ABM group showed reduced activation in the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex when passively viewing negative images. We found no group differences in predefined regions of interest associated with emotion regulation strategies. Response in the temporal cortices was associated with the degree of change in attentional bias and the degree of depressive symptoms in ABM versus placebo.These findings should be replicated in other samples of patients with depression, and in studies using fMRI designs that allow analyses of within-group variability from baseline to follow-up.Attentional bias modification training has an effect on brain function in the circuitry associated with emotional appraisal and the generation of affective states.© 2019 Joule Inc. or its licensors</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581168>Characteristics of a Multistate Outbreak of Lung Injury Associated with E-cigarette Use, or Vaping - United States, 2019.</a></h2><p>Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), also called vapes, e-hookas, vape pens, tank systems, mods, and electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), are electronic devices that produce an aerosol by heating a liquid typically containing nicotine, flavorings, and other additives; users inhale this aerosol into their lungs (1). E-cigarettes also can be used to deliver tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive component of cannabis (1). Use of e-cigarettes is commonly called vaping. Lung injury associated with e-cigarette use, or vaping, has recently been reported in most states (2-4). CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), state and local health departments, and others are investigating this outbreak. This report provides data on patterns of the outbreak and characteristics of patients, including sex, age, and selected substances used in e-cigarette, or vaping, products reported to CDC as part of this ongoing multistate investigation. As of September 24, 2019, 46 state health departments and one territorial health department had reported 805 patients with cases of lung injury associated with use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products to CDC. Sixty-nine percent of patients were males, and the median age was 23 years (range = 13-72 years). To date, 12 deaths have been confirmed in 10 states. Among 514 patients with information on substances used in e-cigarettes, or vaping products, in the 30 days preceding symptom onset, 76.9% reported using THC-containing products, and 56.8% reported using nicotine-containing products; 36.0% reported exclusive use of THC-containing products, and 16.0% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products. The specific chemical exposure(s) causing the outbreak is currently unknown. While this investigation is ongoing, CDC recommends that persons consider refraining from using e-cigarette, or vaping, products, particularly those containing THC. CDC will continue to work in collaboration with FDA and state and local partners to investigate cases and advise and alert the public on the investigation as additional information becomes available.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627083>Exogenous glycine betaine treatment alleviates low temperature-induced pericarp  of 'Nanguo' pears by regulating antioxidant enzymes and proline metabolism.</a></h2><p>The effect of glycine betaine (GB) on chilling injury (CI)-induced pericarp  in 'Nanguo' pears was investigated during shelf life at 20 °C after storage at 0 °C for 120 d.

Upon initial contact with the electrolyte a Li rich, 41 Å thick, layer forms on the surface of the anode below the polymer layer. At 0.8 V (vs. Li/Li), a distinct SEI layer forms from the incorporation of electrolyte decomposition products in the reaction layer that is organic in nature. In addition, solvent uptake in the PEFM layer occurs resulting in the layer swelling to ∼200 Å. Upon further polarization to 0.4 and 0.15 V (vs. Li/Li) a thick layer (800 Å) on the surface of the Si is evident where a diffuse interface between the PEFM and SEI occurs resulting in a matrix between the two layers, as the binder has taken up a large amount of electrolyte. The two layers appear to be interchanging solvent molecules from the PEFM to the SEI to the Si surface preventing the lithiation of the a-Si. By 0.05 V (vs. Li/Li) a Li rich, 72 Å thick, SEI layer condenses on the surface of the anode, and a 121 Å intermixed layer on top of the SEI with LiF and Li-C-O species is present with the rest blended into the electrolyte.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31449443>Effects of injectable dexmedetomidine-ketamine-midazolam and isoflurane inhalation anesthetic protocols on ocular variables in captive black-tailed prairie dogs ().</a></h2><p>To evaluate the effects of injectable dexmedetomidine-ketamine-midazolam (DKM) and isoflurane inhalation (ISO) anesthetic protocols on selected ocular variables in captive black-tailed prairie dogs (; BTPDs).9 zoo-kept BTPDs.The BTPDs received dexmedetomidine hydrochloride (0.25 mg/kg, IM), ketamine hydrochloride (40 mg/kg, IM), and midazolam hydrochloride (1.5 mg/kg, IM) or inhalation of isoflurane and oxygen in a randomized complete crossover design (2-day interval between anesthetic episodes). Pupil size, globe position, tear production, and intraocular pressure measurements were recorded at 5, 30, and 45 minutes after induction of anesthesia. For each BTPD, a phenol red thread test was performed in one randomly selected eye and a modified Schirmer tear test I was performed in the other eye. Intraocular pressure was measured by rebound tonometry.Compared with findings for the DKM protocol, pupil size was smaller at all time points when the BTPDs underwent the ISO protocol. Globe position remained central during anesthesia with the DKM protocol, whereas it varied among central, ventromedial, and ventrolateral positions during anesthesia with the ISO protocol. Tear production and intraocular pressure decreased significantly over time when the BTPDs underwent either protocol.Results indicated that ophthalmic examination findings for anesthetized BTPDs can be influenced by the anesthetic protocol used. The DKM protocol may result in more consistent pupil size and globe position, compared with that achieved by use of the ISO protocol.

Storage at NFT significantly improved the storage quality of apricots by suppressing respiration rate, ethylene production, decay rate, internal  index, membrane permeability, and malondialdehyde content. Apricots stored at NFT maintained higher firmness, total soluble solids, titrable acid, total phenolics, total flavonoids, and ascorbic acid content than those stored at 0-1°C. Additionally, NFT storage enhanced the capacity of radical scavenging and metal chelating, antioxidant properties in apricots compared to those stored at 0-1°C. Hence, NFT storage proved to be an effective method to improve the quality and antioxidant attributes of apricots. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study explored the effect of storage at near freezing temperature (NFT) on the postharvest quality of two cultivars of apricot (var. "Xiaobai" and "Daliguang"). We found that storage for 70 days at NFT resulted in better edible quality compared to storage at 0-1°C and 4-6°C. Apricot quality was determined in terms of respiration rate, ethylene production, decay rate, internal  index, membrane permeability, malondialdehyde content, firmness, total soluble solids, titrable acid, total phenolics, total flavonoids, and ascorbic acid content. The antioxidant properties of the fruits were also retained during storage at NFT.

The device is based on the dry ion localization and locomotion (DRILL) mass spectrometry interface of Fedorov and co-workers. By adding electrospray emitters, heating the desolvation gas, and operating at high gas flow rates, it is possible to obtain stable ion currents up to -15 nA that are ideal for deposition. Coupled with ambient ion optics, this interface enables desolvated ions to be delivered to surfaces while excluding solvent and counterions. Electron microscopy of surfaces prepared using the device reveal discrete POM and no aggregation that degrades electrode performance. Characterization of POM-coated CNT electrodes in a supercapacitor showed an energy storage capacity similar to that achieved with SL in vacuum. For solutions that produce primarily a single ion by electrospray ionization, benchtop SL offers a simpler and less costly approach for surface modification with applications in catalysis, energy storage, and beyond.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31488234>Supplementation of Fermented Barley Extracts with Lactobacillus Plantarum dy-1 Inhibits Obesity via a UCP1-dependent Mechanism.</a></h2><p>We aimed to explore how fermented barley extracts with Lactobacillus plantarum dy-1 (LFBE) affected the  in adipocytes and obese rats.In vitro, 3T3-L1 cells were induced by LFBE, raw barley extraction (RBE) and polyphenol compounds (PC) from LFBE to evaluate the adipocyte differentiation.

And LFBE may potentiate process of the IBAT thermogenesis and epididymis adipose tissue (EAT)  via activating the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-dependent mechanism to suppress the obesity.These results demonstrated that LFBE decreased obesity partly by increasing the BAT mass and the energy expenditure by activating BAT thermogenesis and WAT  in a UCP1-dependent mechanism.Copyright © 2019 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.

This review examines the tissue distribution of the hcrt/orexin system and the variety of biological activities attributed to it. Factors that either stimulate or inhibit the expression of hcrt/orexin system were also addressed in addition to its link to obesity, and insulin and glucose . Hcrt/orexin ligands and receptors have been localized to different parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Hcrt/orexin, orexin 1 and orexin 2 receptors are also present in body fluids (cerebrospinal fluid, blood) and in the exocrine (pancreas, salivary, lacrimal) as well as endocrine (pancreatic islets, pituitary, adrenal) glands. Several factors including stress, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, glutamate, nicotine, glucose, hypoglycemia stimulate the expression of Hcrt/orexin system, but it is inhibited by ageing, bone morphogenetic protein, hypoxia/hypercapnia, melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2 and glucagon. Literature reports show that hcrt/orexin can significantly increase insulin secretion from normal and diabetic rat pancreata. Moreover, several studies reported that the tissue expression of glucose transporter type 4 is markedly higher after treatment with orexin. Hcrt/orexin also decreases blood glucose concentration and reduces insulin resistance. It reduces obesity by increasing browning of  cells and energy expenditure. Taken together, hcrt/orexin modulates obesity and the  of glucose and insulin. The Hcrt/orexin system may thus be a target in the development of new therapies for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.This article is protected by copyright.

Glutamic acid and arginine were higher in constituent amino acids. In the taste value, glutamic acid was highest in constituent and free amino acids. Total phenol contents were highest in 0 min and lowest in 3 min. Hundred twenty-six volatile compounds were detected by GC/MS during roasting. α-pinene, eudesmol, nonane, and limonene were detected as major volatile compounds. For antioxidant ability, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl did not change during roasting, and 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid showed the highest value in 3 min.  intensity showed a slight decrease over time. In Electronic nose, fragrance increased by roasting, and strength, NH , and H S decreased significantly. In Electronic tongue, sweetness, bitterness, and umami taste increased by roasting, and this was related to amino acid composition. The results provide basic data on the physicochemical and flavor characteristics of A. gigas Nakai according to the roasting process. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Angelica gigas Nakai has been known as a medicinal herb in Asian countries and usually consumed in powder, tea, and snacks. In order to produce the powder, tea, or snacks with A. gigas Nakai, thermal treatment is an essential and critical process. Despite that existing studies reported many physiological benefits and functional properties of A. gigas Nakai, studies have rarely discovered how the nutritional properties and volatile compounds of A. gigas Nakai alter when it undergoes thermal treatment. Therefore, this study will be utilized as basic data to optimize the thermal processing conditions (e.g., roasting time) for the production of food products with A. gigas Nakai such as tea and snacks. This study further provides objective chemical measures of sensory profiles of A. gigas Nakai using electronic tongue and electronic nose during the thermal processing.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374571>Persistent low body weight in humans is associated with higher mitochondrial activity in white adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Constitutional thinness (CT) is a state of low but stable body weight (BMI ≤18 kg/m2). CT subjects have normal-range hormonal profiles and food intake but exhibit resistance to weight gain despite living in the modern world's obesogenic environment.The goal of this study is to identify molecular mechanisms underlying this protective phenotype against weight gain.We conducted a clinical overfeeding study on 30 CT subjects and 30 controls (BMI 20-25 kg/m2) matched for age and sex. We performed clinical and integrative molecular and transcriptomic analyses on white adipose and muscle tissues.Our results demonstrate that adipocytes were markedly smaller in CT individuals (mean ± SEM: 2174 ± 142 μm 2) compared with controls (3586 ± 216 μm2) (P < 0.01). The mitochondrial respiratory capacity was higher in CT adipose tissue, particularly at the level of complex II of the electron transport chain (2.2-fold increase; P < 0.01). This higher activity was paralleled by an increase in mitochondrial number (CT compared with control: 784 ± 27 compared with 675 ± 30 mitochondrial DNA molecules per cell; P < 0.05). No evidence for uncoupled respiration or "" of the white adipose tissue was found. In accordance with the mitochondrial differences, CT subjects had a distinct adipose transcriptomic profile [62 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate of 0.1 and log fold change >0.75)], with many differentially expressed genes associating with positive metabolic outcomes. Pathway analyses revealed an increase in fatty acid oxidation ( P = 3 × 10-04) but also triglyceride biosynthesis (P = 3.6 × 10-04). No differential response to the overfeeding was observed in the 2 groups.The distinct molecular signature of the adipose tissue in CT individuals suggests the presence of augm ented futile lipid cycling, rather than mitochondrial uncoupling, as a way to increase energy expenditure in CT individuals. We propose that increased mitochondrial function in adipose tissue is an important mediator in sustaining the low body weight in CT individuals. This knowledge could ultimately allow more targeted approaches for weight management treatment strategies.

This risk is particularly high during ripening due to open-air exposure of the product. Currently, no kill step is applied after manufacture or post ripening to control food safety risks associated with Listeria monocytogenes contamination. Instead, cheesemakers must rely on sanitation and environmental monitoring to reduce this risk. High-pressure processing (HPP) is a nonthermal food-processing technology that can effectively reduce bacterial contaminants with minimal impact on the organoleptic properties of various foods. The objective of this study was to evaluate HPP as a potential intervention to maintain Camembert cheese quality and reduce risk associated with L. monocytogenes. Timing of HPP treatments (3, 11, and 45 d after manufacture) was based on the growth of L. monocytogenes during Camembert cheese ripening. High-pressure processing treatment of fully ripened cheeses (45 d) resulted in destruction of the surface mold, which caused  and yellowing of the cheese rind. Applying HPP treatment earlier in the ripening process (11 d) resulted in a similar degradation of cheese appearance, which did not improve with continued ripening. Applying HPP treatment shortly after production (3 d; before the surface flora developed) delayed the development of the cheese rind and the textural ripening of the cheese. This early treatment time also resulted in free whey being expelled from the cheese, creating a firmer body. Applying HPP 11 d after manufacture resulted in >5 log reduction of L. monocytogenes at 450 and 550 MPa with holding times of 10 min. Although HPP was effective at reducing L. monocytogenes associated with bloomy rind cheeses, the quality deterioration would be unacceptable to consumers. Cheesemakers must continue to emphasize sanitation and environmental monitoring to reduce the risk of L. monocytogenes in bloomy rind cheeses.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Although its expression is correlated with obesity, its precise biological role in adipose tissue is poorly understood in vivo. Here we investigated the function of Tbx15 in brown adipose thermogenesis and white adipose  in vivo.In the present study, we generated adipose-specific Tbx15 knockout (AKO) mice by crossing Tbx15 floxed mice with adiponectin-Cre mice to delineate Tbx15 function in adipose tissues. We systematically investigated the influence of Tbx15 on brown adipose thermogenesis and white adipose  in mice, as well as the possible underlying molecular mechanism.Upon cold exposure, adipocyte  in inguinal adipose tissue was significantly impaired in Tbx15 AKO mice. Furthermore, ablation of Tbx15 blocked adipocyte  induced by β3 adrenergic agonist CL 316243, which did not appear to alter the expression of Tbx15. Analysis of DNA binding sites using chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that TBX15 bound directly to a key region in the Prdm16 promoter, indicating it regulates transcription of Prdm16, the master gene for adipocyte thermogenesis and . Compared to control mice, Tbx15 AKO mice displayed increased body weight gain and decreased whole body energy expenditure in response to high fat diets.Taken together, these findings suggest that Tbx15 regulates adipocyte  and might be a potential target for the treatment of obesity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Experimental biomechanics data were collected during treadmill walking in 10 healthy-weight and 10 obese 8-12 year-olds. We used radiographic images to develop subject-specific musculoskeletal models, generated walking simulations from the experimental data, and predicted patellofemoral joint contact force using established techniques.We found that the obese children had 1.98 times greater absolute (p = 0.002) and 1.81 times greater patellar-area-normalized (p = 0.008) patellofemoral joint contact forces compared to the healthy-weight children. We observed a stronger relationship between absolute patellofemoral joint contact force and BMI (r=0.58) than between patellofemoral joint contact force and body fat percentage (r=0.38).Our results indicate that obese children walk with increased patellofemoral loads in absolute terms and also relative to the area of the articulating surfaces, which likely contributes to the increased risk of knee pain in this pediatric population. This information, which provides a baseline comparison for future longitudinal studies, also informs the type and frequency of physical activity prescription aimed at reducing the risk of knee injury and improving long-term outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Possible effects regulating adaptive thermogenesis and energy waste are poorly known. Therefore, we aimed to study how physiological supplementation with HEP is able to affect microbiota, energy metabolism and adaptive thermogenic capacity, and to contribute to the healthier phenotype promoted by HEP supplementation, as previously shown. We also attempted to decipher some of the mechanisms involved in the HEP effects, including in vitro experiments.We used a model of metabolic malprogramming consisting of the progeny of rats with mild calorie restriction during pregnancy, both under control diet and an obesogenic (high-sucrose) diet, supplemented with HEP, combined with in vitro experiments in primary cultured brown and white adipocytes treated with the postbiotic acetate.Our main findings suggest that chronic HEP supplementation induces markers of brown and white adipose tissue thermogenic capacity, accompanied by a decrease in energy efficiency, and prevention of weight gain under an obesogenic diet. We also show that HEP promotes an increase in beneficial bacteria in the gut and peripheral levels of acetate. Moreover, in vitro acetate can improve adipokine production, and increase thermogenic capacity and  in brown and white adipocytes, respectively, which could be part of the protection mechanism against excess weight gain observed in vivo.HEP and acetate stand out as prebiotic/postbiotic active compounds able to modulate both brown-adipocyte metabolism and  and protect against obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644283>Changes in the soluble and insoluble compounds of shelf-stable orange juice in relation to non-enzymatic  during storage.</a></h2><p>For the first time in literature, this study revealed the participation of polymeric components of orange juice cloud and pulp (such as proteins, arabinogalactan proteins, or protein-pectin complexes) during non-enzymatic . In a quest to better understand the non-enzymatic  of shelf-stable orange juice during storage, the juice was fractionated into different fractions depending on the solubility in water/ethanol and the obtained fractions were characterized. The results showed that brown compounds formed during storage of orange juice distributed over water insoluble (pulp), ethanol insoluble (cloud), and ethanol soluble (serum) fractions. In the ethanol insoluble fraction, the brown compounds are hypothesized to be associated to proteins, arabinogalactan proteins and/or protein-pectin complexes of this fraction without significantly changing their molecular weight distribution, monosaccharide composition, and protein content.

Irisin is released from myocytes during physical activity, and acts as a link between muscles and other tissues and organs. This myokine is produced as a result of proteolytic cleavage of FNDC5 protein present in the membrane of myocytes. Secretion of irisin is regulated by -linked oligosaccharides attached to the protein molecule. The two -glycan molecules, which constitute a significant part of the irisin glycoprotein, regulate the  of adipocytes, which is the most important function of irisin. A receptor specific for irisin has still not been discovered. In some tissues irisin probably acts via integrins, which are widely expressed transmembrane receptors. Many studies have confirmed the multifunctional role of irisin and the beneficial effects of this molecule on body homeostasis. Irisin reduces systemic inflammation, maintains the balance between resorption and bone formation, and modulates metabolic processes and the functioning of the nervous system. It suppresses the expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in obese individuals and attenuates inflammation in adipose tissue. The impact of irisin on cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion has also been demonstrated in numerous studies, which proves its role in carcinogenesis. Owing to these pleiotropic and beneficial properties, irisin may be a potential option to prevent and treat civilization-related diseases which are, nowadays, considered to be the major health problems in Western societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31507448>Irisin Exerts Inhibitory Effect on Adipogenesis Through Regulation of Wnt Signaling.</a></h2><p>Irisin is an exercise-induced myokine known to induce adipocyte  through induction of uncoupling protein 1. Recent studies have reported that irisin is also an adipokine. However, there is limiting evidence on the role of endogenous irisin from adipocytes. In this study we aim to elucidate the expression and secretion pattern of irisin during adipocyte differentiation and the role of endogenous and exogenous irisin on the adipogenic process. As such, recombinant irisin, plasmid expressing FNDC5 and small interfering RNA were utilized. Our results show that the gene expression of irisin precursor FNDC5 and irisin secretion increases at the early stage of adipogenesis. Both recombinant irisin treated cells and FNDC5-overexpressed cells resulted in inhibition of adipogenesis evidenced by downregulated C/EBPα, PPARγ, and FABP4 expression and reduced lipid accumulation. Further data showed that the inhibitory effect of irisin on adipogenesis is mediated though potentiation of Wnt expression, which is known to determine the fate of mesenchymal stem cells and regulate adipogenesis. Conversely, FNDC5 knockdown cells showed downregulated Wnt expression, but failed to further induce adipogenesis. This study suggests that both exogenous and endogenous irisin is able to inhibit adipogenesis and that activation of Wnt and subsequent repression of transcription factors is partly involved in this process. This provides a novel insight on the local effect of irisin on adipocytes and additional benefit to protect against obesity-related metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31476500>Slower vegetation greening faced faster social development on the landscape of the Belt and Road region.</a></h2><p>The thinking of landscape sustainability discussed the win-win goal of landscape management for both ecological conservation and social development. The China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative has a pathway of green development towards sustainability, which could be benefited from a corporation on transnational landscape management. Although previous remote sensing observations showed that the ecosystem improvement and social development can coexist in most of the Belt and Road region, whether the change tendencies can be sustained have been neglected. Based on the continuous vegetation index, nighttime light and landcover datasets between 1980s-2010s, a detailed observation of the landscape evolution was obtained in this study. Depending on the identifications of temporal breakpoints, the time series was separated to identify the former and latter tendencies, and the evolution score were evaluated. The results showed that the vegetation greening trend weakened in nearly half of the region, and the arid region mostly experienced vegetation  lately. The evolution patterns of ecological landscape and social landscape were coincided distributed in China and India, and in Southeast Asia was not scored high for both ecological conservation and social development.

This study analyzed the long-term outcomes of elbow release and tricepsplasty in a series of children with arthrogryposis at a tertiary institution.Medical records of patients with arthrogryposis who underwent elbow release and tricepsplasty from 1993 to 2015, with at least 2 years of follow-up, were reviewed. Collected measures included preoperative elbow passive range of motion (ROM), postoperative elbow passive and active ROM, shoulder passive and active ROM, and Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI) scores. Our analysis compared pre- and postoperative follow-up of elbow passive ROM and reviewed PODCI scores with age-adjusted normative values.Seventeen patients (4 female and 13 male) with 24 affected upper extremities (10 left elbow and 14 right elbow) were included in final analysis. Age at final follow-up averaged 11 years (range, 4-20 years), mean age at surgery was 2.7 years (range, 9.6 months-9.3 years) with mean follow-up by extremity at 8.3 years (range, 2-18 years). Differences in pre- and post-operative passive elbow ROM were significant for extension, flexion, and total arc of motion. Most parent and self-reported PODCI scores were less than the age-adjusted normal population, except in the domains of Comfort and Pain and Happiness.Long-term follow-up of elbow release and tricepsplasty in patients with arthrogryposis indicates both increased and sustained elbow flexion and arc of motion. Although PODCI scores were lower compared with the age-adjusted norm, pediatric patients with arthrogryposis were just as happy and had no more discomfort than their unaffected age-adjusted norms.Therapeutic IV.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Surgery of the Hand.

We investigated factors associated with T2D remission and relapse after RYGB.Retrospective review of consecutive patients with T2D who underwent RYGB between 1993 and 2017. T2D remission was defined as medications discontinuation and/or HbA1c<6.5%; relapse was defined as recurrent medication use and/or HbA1c≥6.5%. Independent correlates of T2D remission and relapse were identified using logistic regression.621 patients (aged 46.7±10.6 years; 30% on insulin; BMI 49.8±8.3 kg/m) had at least one-year follow-up. Median follow-up was 4.9 (range 1-23.6) years. Prevalence of T2D remission was 74% at one year, 73% from one to three years, 63% between 3 and 10 years, and 47% beyond 10 years. 93% of remissions occurred within 3 years of RYGB, 25% relapsed. The median (IQR) time to relapse was 5.3 (3-7.8) years after remission. Higher one-year percentage total body weight (%TBW) loss, lack of preoperative insulin use, and younger age at surgery were independently associated with T2D remission. Preoperative insulin use, lower %TBW loss at one year, and greater %TBW gain after one year were independently associated with T2D relapse.This longitudinal retrospective analysis shows that preoperative insulin use and age, one-year weight loss, and regain after that influence T2D remission and relapse following RYGB. Referring patients at a younger age, before insulin is needed, and optimizing both weight loss and weight maintenance after RYGB may improve the rates and durability of T2D remission.Copyright © 2019.

However, for hypermetabolic conditions stemming from burn trauma or cancer cachexia,  is thought to contribute to energy wasting and supraphysiological nutritional requirements. Metformin's impact on this phenomenon and underlying mechanisms have not been explored.We used both a murine burn model and human ex vivo adipose explants to assess metformin and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)'s effects on the development of subcutaneous beige adipose. Enzymes involved in fat homeostasis and , as well as mitochondrial dynamics, were assessed to determine metformin's effects.Treatment with the biguanide metformin lowers lipolysis in beige fat by inducing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) independently of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation. Increased PP2A activity catalyzes the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser 79) and hormone sensitive lipase (Ser 660), thus promoting fat storage and the "whitening" of otherwise lipolytic beige adipocytes. Moreover, co-incubation of metformin with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid countered the anti-lipolytic effects of this biguanide in human adipose. Additionally, we show that metformin does not activate this pathway in the WAT of control mice and that AICAR sustains the  of white adipose, offering further evidence that metformin acts independently of this cellular energy sensor.This work provides novel insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of metformin's therapeutic benefits and potential as an agent to reduce the lipotoxicity associated with hypermetabolism and adipose .Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we investigated the  effect of black raspberry ( Miquel) using in vitro and in vivo models. Black raspberry water extract (BRWE) treatment inhibited lipid accumulation in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and zebrafish. To evaluate the thermogenic activity, BRWE was orally administered for 2 weeks, and then, the mice were placed in a 4 °C environment. As a result, BRWE treatment increased rectal temperature and inguinal WAT (iWAT) thermogenesis by inducing the expression of beige fat specific markers such as PR domain zinc-finger protein 16 (PRDM16), uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α), and t-box protein 1 (TBX1) in cold-exposed mice. Furthermore, ellagic acid (EA), a constituent of BRWE, markedly promoted beige specific markers: UCP1, PGC1α, TBX1, and nuclear respiratory factor 1 in beige differentiation media (DM)-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our findings indicate that BRWE can promote beige differentiation/activation, and EA is the active compound responsible for such effect.

Heme  concentrations are low (<1 pmol L) in iron limited phytoplankton in cultures and in the field. Here, we determined heme  in marine particulate material (>0.7 μm) from the North Atlantic Ocean (GEOVIDE cruise - GEOTRACES section GA01), which spanned several biogeochemical regimes. We examined the relationship between heme  abundance and the microbial community composition, and its utility for mapping iron limited phytoplankton. Heme  concentrations ranged from 0.16 to 5.1 pmol L (median = 2.0 pmol L,  = 62) in the surface mixed layer (SML) along the cruise track, driven mainly by variability in biomass. However, in the Irminger Basin, the lowest heme  levels (SML: median = 0.53 pmol L,  = 12) were observed, whilst the biomass was highest (particulate organic carbon, median = 14.2 μmol L,  = 25; chlorophyll : median = 2.0 nmol L,  = 23) pointing to regulatory mechanisms of the heme  pool for growth conservation. Dissolved iron (DFe) was not depleted (SML: median = 0.38 nmol L,  = 11) in the Irminger Basin, but large diatoms ( sp.) dominated. Hence, heme  depletion and regulation is likely to occur during bloom progression when phytoplankton class-dependent absolute iron requirements exceed the available ambient concentration of DFe. Furthermore, high heme  concentrations found in the Iceland Basin and Labrador Sea (median = 3.4 pmol L,  = 20), despite having similar DFe concentrations to the Irminger Basin, were attributed to an earlier growth phase of the extant phytoplankton populations.

However, it is not a prescribing guideline detailing treatments for the commonly observed bacterial diseases in commercial poultry.An online survey was deployed to all registered veterinarians and members of the Australian Veterinary Poultry Association to identify prescribing behaviours for the most frequently observed bacterial diseases of poultry.A total of 39 survey responses were received. Most surveys were started but not completed; 13 (33%) were completed with 18 (46%) containing some information on prescribing. The most frequent treatment responses were for Escherichia coli in both layers and broilers, chronic respiratory disease (CRD), fowl cholera and spotty liver in layers and necrotic enteritis in broilers. Treatments described were for products registered for poultry use, within the recommended label dose and duration of treatment (Tables 1, 2). Unsurprisingly, tetracyclines and amoxycillin, followed by lincomycin and trimethoprim sulfonamide products were the most frequently reported treatment options. Inappropriate treatments were reported for salmonellosis and one veterinarian recommended the use of enrofloxacin for the treatment of fowl cholera.Information provided by respondents will enable the initial development of prescribing guidelines for both commercial and small poultry flocks. Importantly, it identified less than optimal prescribing behaviour for some diseases, a reliance on one class of antibiotic more than others and a failure to utilise all antimicrobial classes potentially available for treatment. Critically, the survey identified a lack of treatment options for bacterial disease in poultry. The most important bacterial diseases of poultry remain the same; effective alternatives for antibiotic treatment are required and old diseases, thought once gone, are reinventing themselves as problems for the future. Surveys of prescribing behaviours are essential for identifying diseases of high priority, changes in treatments and response to treatment and to identify areas for targeted antimicrobial stewardship, and research needs.© 2019 Australian Veterinary Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590292>The Role of Adipose Tissue Mitochondria: Regulation of Mitochondrial Function for the Treatment of Metabolic Diseases.</a></h2><p> Mitochondria play a key role in maintaining energy homeostasis in metabolic tissues, including adipose tissues. The two main types of adipose tissues are the white adipose tissue (WAT) and the brown adipose tissue (BAT). WAT primarily stores excess energy, whereas BAT is predominantly responsible for energy expenditure by non-shivering thermogenesis through the mitochondria. WAT in response to appropriate stimuli such as cold exposure and β-adrenergic agonist undergoes  wherein it acts as BAT, which is characterized by the presence of a higher number of mitochondria. Mitochondrial dysfunction in adipocytes has been reported to have strong correlation with metabolic diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. Dysfunction of mitochondria results in detrimental effects on adipocyte differentiation, lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, oxidative capacity, and thermogenesis, which consequently lead to metabolic diseases. Recent studies have shown that mitochondrial function can be improved by using thiazolidinedione, mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, and dietary natural compounds; by performing exercise; and by controlling caloric restriction, thereby maintaining the metabolic homeostasis by inducing adaptive thermogenesis of BAT and  of WAT. In this review, we focus on and summarize the molecular regulation involved in the improvement of mitochondrial function in adipose tissues so that strategies can be developed to treat metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615585>A role for 5-HT receptors in human learning and memory.</a></h2><p>5-HT4 receptor stimulation has pro-cognitive and antidepressant-like effects in animal experimental studies; however, this pharmacological approach has not yet been tested in humans. Here we used the 5-HT4 receptor partial agonist prucalopride to assess the translatability of these effects and characterise, for the first time, the consequences of 5-HT4 receptor activation on human cognition and emotion.Forty one healthy volunteers were randomised, double-blind, to a single dose of prucalopride (1 mg) or placebo in a parallel group design. They completed a battery of cognitive tests measuring learning and memory, emotional processing and reward sensitivity.Prucalopride increased recall of words in a verbal learning task, increased the accuracy of recall and recognition of words in an incidental emotional memory task and increased the probability of choosing a symbol associated with a high likelihood of reward or absence of loss in a probabilistic instrumental learning task. Thus acute prucalopride produced pro-cognitive effects in healthy volunteers across three separate tasks.These findings are a translation of the memory enhancing effects of 5-HT4 receptor agonism seen in animal studies, and lend weight to the idea that the 5-HT4 receptor could be an innovative target for the treatment of cognitive deficits associated with depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Contrary to the effects reported in animal models, prucalopride did not reveal an antidepressant profile in human measures of emotional processing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553232>GDF5 Promotes White Adipose Tissue Thermogenesis via p38 MAPK Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>Growth differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) was reported to regulate brown adipogenesis; however, its effects on insulin sensitivity, full metabolic syndrome spectrum, and the thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) have not been elucidated yet. We thus generated fatty acid-binding protein 4 (Fabp4)-GDF5 transgenic (TG) mice and showed that GDF5 TG mice developed a relative lean phenotype on a high-fat diet (HFD) and showed increased insulin sensitivity. Over expression of GDF5 in adipose tissues greatly promoted the thermogenic process in sWAT after cold or β3-agonist treatment. In TG mice, sWAT showed an important thermogenic effect as the thermogenic gene expression was markedly increased, which was consistent with the typical features of beige adipocytes. Moreover, knockdown of the protein GDF5 impaired  program in sWAT after thermogenic stimuli. Enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) signaling was also identified in sWAT of HFD-fed GDF5 mice, and thermogenesis in mature adipocytes induced by GDF5 protein could be partly blocked by a p38 MAPK inhibitor. Taken together, our data suggest that GDF5 could improve insulin sensitivity and prevent metabolic syndrome, the adaptive thermogenesis in sWAT could mediate the obesity resistance effects of GDF5 in mice and partially resulted in the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31438646>Superiority of the Non-Glycosylated Form Over the Glycosylated Form of Irisin in the Attenuation of Adipocytic Meta-Inflammation: A Potential Factor in the Fight Against Insulin Resistance.</a></h2><p>Irisin is an adipomyokine that promotes the  of white adipose tissue and exhibits protective potential against the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In our bodies, it occurs in its glycosylated form (G-IR): its activity is still poorly understood, because the majority of studies have used its non-glycosylated counterpart (nG-IR). Glycosylation can affect protein function: therefore, the present study attempted to compare the actions of both forms of irisin toward inflammatory activation of the main component of adipose tissue. The study was carried out in a coculture of 3T3 adipocytes and RAW 264.7 macrophages maintained in the presence of nG-IR or G-IR. The impact on vitality and the expression and release of key inflammatory mediators important for insulin resistance and diabetes development were assessed. The studies showed that both forms effectively inhibited the expression and release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, macrophage chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, high-mobility group box (HMGB1), leptin, and adiponectin. However, in the case of TNF-α, IL-1β, MCP-1, and HMGB1, the inhibition exerted by nG-IR was more prominent than that by G-IR. In addition, only nG-IR significantly inhibited macrophage migration. Here, nG-IR seemed to be the stronger inhibitor of the development of obesity-related inflammation; however, G-IR also had anti-inflammatory potential.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628360>Extensive vegetation  and drying in forests of India's Tiger Reserves.</a></h2><p>Forest conservation includes stemming deforestation as well as preserving its vegetation condition. Traditional Protected Area (PA) effectiveness evaluations have assessed changes in forest extent but have mostly ignored vegetation condition. Tiger Reserves (TRs) are India's PAs with highest protection and management resources. We used a before-after-control-impact-style design with long-term Landsat 5 TM data to evaluate the effects of protection elevation on vegetation condition (greenness and moisture) in 25 TRs. After declaration as TRs, vegetation condition in 13 TRs (52%) declined in more than 50% of their areas, with 12 TRs (48%) being overall better than their matched Wildlife Sanctuaries (WLSs; PAs with lower protection). In 8 of these TRs analysed for change from before to after declaration, vegetation condition in 5 TRs was harmed over more than 25% of their areas, with 3 TRs being overall better than their matched WLSs. Our results indicate extensive vegetation  and drying in about half of the study TRs, with these trends often being similar or worse than in matched WLSs. These results suggest that TRs' elevated protection alone may be insufficient to preserve vegetation condition and cast doubt on the effectiveness of protection elevation alone in safeguarding long-term viability of tiger habitats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31353525>Heat-induced tolerance to  of fresh-cut lily bulbs (Lilium lancifolium Thunb.) under cold storage.</a></h2><p>Fresh-cut lily bulbs were submerged in hot water at 50°C for 3 min as a condition of heat treatment (HT), and then stored at 4°C for 15 days to investigate the effects of HT on . Results showed that heat-treated samples exhibited lower  degree and had reduced cell death rate and cell membrane permeability when compared to control samples during storage. HT resulted in a significant inhibition in total phenol content and the activities of phenylalanine ammonialyase, polyphenol oxidase, and peroxidase. HT also stimulated the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, however, inhibited lipoxygenase activity and malondialdehyde accumulation. Correlation analysis showed that lipid peroxidation of cell membrane was significantly correlated with  of fresh-cut lily bulbs. The results indicated that HT could serve as an effective approach to retard  of fresh-cut lily bulbs. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The effect of heat treatment (HT) on fresh-cut lily bulbs by treating in hot water (50°C) for 3 min was investigated. It provided experimental basis for further studies of HT in extending the shelf life of fresh-cut lily bulbs. Furthermore, it is a foundation for the application of HT in the processing of fresh-cut lily bulbs.

The systemic increase of free fatty acids (FFA) due to burn-induced lipolysis and subsequent organ fatty infiltration may culminate in multiple organ dysfunction and ultimately, death. Thus, reducing WAT lipolysis to diminish the mobilization of FFAs may render an effective means to improve outcomes post-burn. Here, we investigated the metabolic effects of Acipimox, a clinically approved drug that suppresses lipolysis via inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Using a murine model of thermal injury, we show that specific inhibition of HSL with Acipimox effectively suppresses burn-induced lipolysis in the inguinal WAT leading to lower levels of circulating FFAs at 7 days post-burn (p < 0.05). The FFA substrate shortage indirectly repressed the thermogenic activation of adipose tissue following injury, reflected by the decrease in protein expression of key  markers, UCP-1 (p < 0.001) and PGC-1α (p < 0.01). Importantly, reduction of FFA mobilization by Acipimox significantly decreased liver weight and intracellular fat accumulation (p < 0.05), suggesting that it may also improve organ function post-burn.

Descriptive statistics and chi-square statistics were used to examine line item concordance, overall and by services groups (survivorship vs. other oncology service). Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to estimate the effects of service delivery group on the concordance.Institutional compliance with the ASCO template was very high; 76% of the 66 line items were present in at least 75% of the delivered TS/SCPs. There was a significantly higher rate of concordance for TS/SCPs provided by the survivorship service (83% vs. 66%, P = 0.006). TS/SCPs provided by the survivorship service were nearly twice as likely to be concordant with ASCO template (OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.77-2.00) compared to those by other service groups.Use of the electronic medical record to auto-populate information was instrumental in achieving a high rate of concordance.

Brown adipose tissue promotes energy expenditure by incorporating the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), also known as thermogenin, which decouples cellular respiration and heat production, in the mitochondrial membranes. Recent data suggest the presence of a thermogenic cell formation from white adipocytes (beige or brite cells) with a potential role in preventing obesity and metabolic syndrome. The formation of these cells is influenced by physical exertion that induces expression of PPARγ coactivator-1 (PGC1) and downstream membrane protein, fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) in skeletal muscle. Irisin, a thermogenic adipomyokine produced by FNDC5 cleavage is involved in the  of adipose tissue. While animal studies are congruent with regard to the relationship between physical exertion and irisin release, the results from human studies are less than clear. Therefore, this review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of muscle and adipose tissue thermogenesis. Further, it describes the molecular mechanisms by which irisin impacts exercise, glucose homeostasis and obesity. Finally, the review discusses current gaps and controversies related to irisin release, its mode of action and its future potential as a therapeutic tool in managing obesity and metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31489448>Incidental fetal imaging with CT: a pictorial essay.</a></h2><p>Although CT is not the first choice for abdominal imaging of pregnant patients, it can be indicated for pregnant patients with emergent life-threatening conditions.

Manganese acts as a relaxation time-shortening contrast agent for both T and T, and where standard chow is hydrated in the gastrointestinal tract, bright signals are produced when using T-weighted imaging (TWI). As a result of peristalsis, gastrointestinal hyperintensities result in temporally unstable signals, leading to image ghosting and decreased resolution from that prescribed. To avoid the problem, various methods of gastrointestinal tract modulation, including the use of intestinal cleansing with laxatives and dietary modulation, have been reported. Here, dietary modulation has been extended to the use of a biologically innocuous, long-term change of diet. In this study, we report on the use of a commercially available manganese-free chow to improve the image quality of the gastrointestinal tract. This manganese-free chow, apart from the omitted manganese which is available in tap water, is a complete diet and readily available. We investigated the time-dependent, diet-related gastrointestinal intensities on short-TR TWI magnetic resonance imaging; monitored body mass, food and water consumption and standard blood biochemistry analysis following diet change; and determined manganese concentration in blood plasma following a five-day change to manganese-free chow. We show that the manganese-free chow presents a refinement to other gastrointestinal tract modulation, as it avoids the need for invasive procedures for gut voiding and can be provided ad libitum so that animals can be maintained with no need for prescribed diet change before imaging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31353095>Editorial commentary: Scanning for threats and natural environments giving our reptilian brains a break.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401211>Phytochemicals as potential candidates to combat obesity via adipose non-shivering thermogenesis.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a chronic metabolic disease caused by a long-term imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. The discovery of three different shades of adipose tissues has implications in terms of understanding the pathogenesis and potential interventions for obesity and its related complications. Fat , as well as activation of brown adipocytes and new beige adipocytes differentiated from adipogenic progenitor cells, are emerging as interesting and promising methods to curb obesity because of their unique capacity to upregulate non-shivering thermogenesis. This capacity is due to catabolism of stored energy to generate heat through the best characterized thermogenic effector uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). A variety of phytochemicals have been shown in the literature to contribute to thermogenesis by acting as chemical uncouplers, UCP1 inducers or regulators of fat differentiation and . In this review, we summarize the mechanisms and strategies for targeting adipose-mediated thermogenesis and highlight the role of phytochemicals in targeting adipose thermogenesis to fight against obesity. We also discuss proposed targets for how these phytochemical molecules promote BAT activity, WAT  and beige cell development, thereby offering novel insights into interventional strategies of how phytochemicals may help prevent and manage obesity via adipose thermogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a metabolic disease defined histologically by lipid accumulation and lipid storage, which promote tumor cell survival; however, the significance of eliminating the lipid remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that melatonin activates transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1A (PGC1A) and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-dependent lipid autophagy and a lipid  program to elicit a catabolic state called "tumor slimming," thus suppressing tumor progression. Metabolic coregulator data analysis revealed that PGC1A expression was decreased in ccRCC tissues versus normal tissues, and poor patient outcome was associated with lower expression of PGC1A in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-KIRC). PGC1A was downregulated in ccRCC and associated with disease progression. Restoration of PGC1A expression by melatonin in ccRCC cells significantly repressed tumor progression and eliminated the abnormal lipid deposits. Furthermore, a phenomenon called "tumor slimming" was observed, in which tumor cell volume was reduced and lipid droplets transformed into tiny pieces. Additional studies indicated that melatonin promoted "tumor slimming" and suppressed ccRCC progression through PGC1A/UCP1-mediated autophagy and lipid . During this process, autophagy and lipid  eliminate lipid deposits without providing energy. These studies demonstrate that the novel "tumor slimming" pathway mediated by melatonin/PGC1A/UCP1 exhibits prognostic potential in ccRCC, thus revealing the significance of monitoring and manipulating this pathway for cancer therapy.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Currently, animal models that replicate clinical PTE (delayed spontaneous and recurrent seizures) are limited, which hinders pre-clinical research. In this study, we used two rat models of penetrating ballistic-like brain injury (PBBI) and closed-head injury (CHI) to induce spontaneous seizures and also measure changes in seizure susceptibility. In the PBBI model, two trajectories (frontal and lateral) and two injury severities for each trajectory, were evaluated. In the CHI model, a single projectile impact to the dorsal/lateral region of the head was tested. Continuous video-electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were collected for 10 days at 1 or 6 month(s) post-injury. After EEG recording, all rats were given a sub-convulsant dose of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) to challenge the seizure susceptibility. The video-EEG recording did not detect PTE following the PBBI. Only one CHI rat demonstrated persistent and recurrent non-convulsive seizures detected at 6 months post-injury. However, after PTZ challenge, 50-100% of the animals across different TBI groups experienced seizures. Seizure susceptibility increased over time from 1 to 6 months post-injury across the majority of TBI groups. Injury severity effects were not apparent within the PBBI model, but were evident between PBBI and CHI models. These results demonstrated the difficulties in detecting delayed spontaneous post-traumatic seizures even in a high-risk model of penetrating brain injury. The PTZ-induced increase in seizure susceptibility indicated the existence of vulnerable risk of epileptogenesis following TBI, which may be considered as an alternative research tool for pre-clinical studies of PTE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638856>ACE2 exerts anti-obesity effect via stimulating brown adipose tissue and induction of  in white adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin II (Ang II)/AngII type1 receptor (AT1R) axis is a key player in the pathophysiology of obesity. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) counteracts Ang II/AT1R axis via converting Ang II to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), which is known to have an anti-obesity effect. In this study, we hypothesized that ACE2 exerts a strong anti-obesity effect by increasing Ang1-7 levels. We injected intraperitoneally recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) (2.0mg/ kg/day) for 28 days to high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity mice. rhACE2 treatment decreased body weight and improved glucose metabolism. Furthermore, rhACE2 increased oxygen consumption and upregulated thermogenesis in HFD-fed mice. In the rhACE2 treatment group, BAT mass increased, accompanied with ameliorated insulin signaling and increased protein levels of UCP-1 and PRDM16. Importantly, subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) mass decreased, concomitant with , which was established by the increase of UCP-1 expression. The  is due to increased H3K27 acetylation via the downregulation of HDAC3 and increased H3K9 acetylation via upregulation of GCN5 and PCAF.

Moreover, residue generation by rice industries is another challenge. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of microwave irradiation during soaking and gelatinization stages of parboiling rice. Processing time, colorimetric profile, broken and nongelatinized grains, sucrose and glucose content, free 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural, and residual phosphorus were evaluated. As the soaking and gelatinization times during microwave treatments increased, the colorimetric parameters increased; however, the values were lower than those with the conventional process. Regardless of soaking time, a decrease in broken and nongelatinized grains was obtained by using the lowest steaming time (5 min). Additionally, lower residual phosphorus content was found in soaking water (10 and 20 min) when using microwave irradiation. Under favorable conditions, a reduction in the levels of broken and nongelatinized grains, residual phosphorus, and color changes was observed, indicating that microwave irradiation may be more beneficial than conventional parboiling. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Parboiling requires a high volume of water and soaking time, which leads to high costs, underutilization of infrastructures, and high residue in the water after processing. The rapid parboiling process involves the use of microwaves during the soaking and gelatinization stages. The main advantages of the microwave parboiling process include reduced processing time, ranging from 83% to 95%, higher gelatinization, greater yield, reduced darkening, and reduced residual phosphorus in the effluents by 60%.

However, delivery of medication in drinking water cannot be assumed to deliver an equal dose to all animals in a group. There is substantial between-animal variability in systemic exposure to an antimicrobial (i.e. the antimicrobial concentration in plasma), resulting in under-dosing or over-dosing of many pigs.

Additionally, the effect of combination treatment on juice quality was determined by measuring the changes in color, pH, non-enzymatic  index, and total phenolic content. A mixed cocktail of the three pathogens was inoculated into apple juice, followed by treatment with US (40 kHz) alone, FA (0.05, 0.1, and 0.15%) alone, and a combination of US and FA for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min. Combined US and 0.15% FA treatment for 5 min achieved 5.67, 6.35, and 3.47 log reductions in E. coli O157:H7, S.

To identify the mechanism of this synergistic bactericidal action, membrane integrity, malfunctions in the membrane efflux pump, and intracellular enzyme activity were measured. The analyses confirmed that damage to the cell envelope (membrane integrity and efflux pump) was strongly related to the synergistic microbial inactivation.

Mothers and infants were followed through week 48 after delivery. The primary outcome was a composite of treatment-related maternal adverse events of grade 3 or higher or permanent discontinuation of the trial regimen because of toxic effects. The noninferiority margin was an upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference in the rate of the primary outcome of less than 5 events per 100 person-years.A total of 956 women were enrolled. A primary outcome event occurred in 72 of 477 women (15.1%) in the immediate group and in 73 of 479 (15.2%) in the deferred group (incidence rate, 15.03 and 14.93 events per 100 person-years, respectively; rate difference, 0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.77 to 4.98, which met the criterion for noninferiority). Two women in the immediate group and 4 women in the deferred group died (incidence rate, 0.40 and 0.78 per 100 person-years, respectively; rate difference, -0.39; 95% CI, -1.33 to 0.56); all deaths occurred during the postpartum period, and 4 were from liver failure (2 of the women who died from liver failure had received isoniazid [1 in each group]). Tuberculosis developed in 6 women (3 in each group); the incidence rate was 0.60 per 100 person-years in the immediate group and 0.59 per 100 person-years in the deferred group (rate difference, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.94 to 0.96). There was a higher incidence in the immediate group than in the deferred group of an event included in the composite adverse pregnancy outcome (stillbirth or spontaneous abortion, low birth weight in an infant, preterm delivery, or congenital anomalies in an infant) (23.6% vs. 17.0%; difference, 6.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.8 to 11.9).The risks associated with initiation of isoniazid preventive therapy during pregnancy appeared to be greater than those associated with initiation of therapy during the postpartum period.

Thermodynamic parameters of enzymes, including the melting point (T ) and ∆G values, were obtained from thermal and chemical denaturation curves. Complexes I and II showed a competitive inhibitory effect on MT with K values of 0.45 and 0.29 mM, respectively. The T values were calculated as 328.6, 322.4, and 318 K and the ∆G values as 62.8, 52.9, and 47.1 KJ mol for the enzyme alone and its interaction with complexes I and II, respectively. Intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence techniques showed structural instability of the enzyme in concomitance with a decrease in the regular secondary structure acquired using CD spectrometry. This data clearly prove that the new derivatives show a stronger inhibitory effect than the separate compounds. Molecular docking analysis showed that the best possible interaction condition was achieved for chrysin with n-6. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: MT is a suitable model in medicine for the investigation of melanogenesis, skin disorders, and hyperpigmentation because of its accessibility and close structural similarity to mammalian tyrosinase. In recent years, the designing of tyrosinase inhibitors from natural substances for prevention of hyperpigmentation in medicine, skin cosmetics, and undesired  in agriculture and food industry has risen sharply. Many of the pharmaceutical products based on the use of flavonoids and poly unsaturated acids as natural compounds or on their semi-synthetic derivatives have been interested for investigations because of their usefulness in many pathological conditions such as inflammation, cancer, and skin disorders. The limitation of the flavonoids applications are low bioavailability, permeability, and solubility for the cells. In this study, conjugation of chrysin with n-3 and n-6 fatty acids resulted in a stronger inhibitors of MT with a synergic inhibitory effect on its activity.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31353556>Purification and biochemical characterization of polyphenol oxidase from soursop (Annona muricata L.) and its inactivation by microwave and ultrasound treatments.</a></h2><p>The soursop (Annona muricata L.) is a climacteric fruit that may undergo enzymatic  during ripening, mainly by the activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO). Soursop PPO was purified 160-fold by hydrophobic interaction and ion-exchange chromatography. The native structure has a molecular weight of 112 kDa corresponding to a dimeric structure.

While smoking rates are high in the region, unexplained variation remains, and community-engaged research approaches are warranted to identify contributing factors. The Mountain Air Project's community advisory board recommended that investigators invite youth to provide their perspectives on possible contributing factors to respiratory illness, and we undertook an exploratory study to determine the utility of photovoice to elicit such perspectives with this population. While photovoice has been employed for other youth-focused health studies in Appalachia, to our knowledge, this work represents the region's first environmental study using photovoice among youth. Over eight weeks, ten participants (age 12-18) represented their perspectives through photographs and accompanying narratives. A brief thematic content analysis of the youth narratives that accompanied the photos revealed three primary themes of environmental determinants of respiratory illness. These themes included compromises community members make regarding respiratory health in order to secure a livelihood; tension between cultural legacies and respiratory health; and consequences of geographic forces. This study demonstrates the value of incorporating youth perspectives in environmental health research, and that photovoice was a valuable approach to elicit such perspectives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379744>A Possible Mechanism: Genistein Improves Metabolism and Induces White Fat  Through Modulating Hypothalamic Expression of , and .</a></h2><p>Bioactive food components have gained growing attention in recent years. Multiple studies demonstrated that genistein had beneficial effects on metabolism. However, the exact mechanism by which genistein improves metabolism remains unclear, especially the central regulation. This study was designed to evaluate whether addition of genistein to the high-fat diet could counter metabolic disorders and whether these alterations were associated with gene expression in hypothalamus. C57BL/6 mice were fed either a high-fat diet (HF), high-fat diet with genistein (0.25 g/kg diet) (HFG) or a normal control diet (CON) for 8 weeks. Body weight was assessed during the study. After 8-week intervention, content of inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), perirenal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) were weighed. Glucose tolerance test, the serum levels of insulin and lipid were assessed. The mRNA of  marker was detected in the white fat. The hypothalamus was collected for whole transcriptome sequencing and reverse transcription quantitative PCR validation. The results demonstrated that mice fed HFG diet had lower body weight and SAT mass, decrease levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and free fatty acids, higher  marker of  and  in WAT and an improvement in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity compared with those in HF group. Transcriptome sequencing showed that there were three differentially expressed genes in hypothalamus among the three groups, including , and , which were significantly correlated with the  markers in WAT and insulin sensitivity. Thus, regulating gene expressions in hypothalamus is a potential mechanism for genistein improving metabolism and inducing WAT , which may provide a novel target for the precaution and treatment of T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603974>Cutaneous sarcoidosis presenting as a cutaneous horn.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604029>Intermittent restraint-induced sympathetic activation attenuates hepatic steatosis and inflammation in a high fat-diet fed-mouse model.</a></h2><p>NAFLD is very prevalent worldwide, and is associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Stress is physiological and biological response to maintain homeostasis of body against stressors while severe stress response is an important contributor to various illnesses including metabolic syndrome and brain disorders. We have evaluated the effects of intermittent restraint stress on NAFLD in a HFD-fed mouse model. C57/BL6 mice had free access to a 60% HFD for 8 weeks, with or without intermittent restraint stress (3 h) conducted 3 times a week. HFD administration increased fat accumulation in liver tissues. Unlike the stressed standard diet group, the levels of hepatic total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly ameliorated in the HFD with stress group compared to the HFD alone group. These beneficial results were in accordance with serum levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and hepatic levels of TNF-α and oxidative stress parameters (ROS, NO, and malondialdehyde). The intermittent restraint stress significantly attenuated the HFD-derived alterations in serum insulin levels, hepatic protein kinase B (AKT) activity and gene expression especially related to lipogenesis. This intermittent restraint stress also elevated the serum epinephrine concentration and activated the adrenergic receptor β2 or β 3 in livers or WAT. The activations of energy expenditure markers (UCP1, PGC1α) in brown adipose tissue and the  of WAT were also observed in the HFD with stress group. Taken together, our findings showed the beneficial effects of sympathetic activation by intermittent restraint stress on HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and partial inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611815>Acute Aerobic Exercise Leads to Increased Plasma Levels of R- and S-β-Aminoisobutyric Acid in Humans.</a></h2><p>Recently, it was suggested that β-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) is a myokine involved in  of fat. However, there is no evidence for an acute effect of exercise supporting this statement and the metabolic distinct enantiomers of BAIBA were not taken into account. Concerning these enantiomers, there is at this point no consensus about resting concentrations of plasma R- and S-BAIBA. Additionally, a polymorphism of the alanine - glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 (AGXT2) gene (rs37369) is known to have a high impact on baseline levels of total BAIBA, but the effect on the enantiomers is unknown. Fifteen healthy recreationally active subjects, with different genotypes of rs37369, participated in a randomized crossover trial where they exercised for 1 h at 40% of P or remained at rest. Plasma samples were analyzed for R- and S-BAIBA using dual column HPLC-fluorescence. The plasma concentration of baseline R-BAIBA was 67 times higher compared to S-BAIBA (1734 ± 821 vs. 29.3 ± 7.8 nM). Exercise induced a 13 and 20% increase in R-BAIBA and S-BAIBA, respectively. The AGXT2 rs37369 genotype strongly affected baseline levels of R-BAIBA, but did not have an impact on baseline S-BAIBA. We demonstrate that BAIBA should not be treated as one molecule, given (1) the markedly uneven distribution of its enantiomers in human plasma favoring R-BAIBA, and (2) their different metabolic source, as evidenced by the AGXT2 polymorphism only affecting R-BAIBA. The proposed function in organ cross talk is supported by the current data and may apply to both enantiomers, but the tissue of origin remains unclear.Copyright © 2019 Stautemas, Van Kuilenburg, Stroomer, Vaz, Blancquaert, Lefevere, Everaert and Derave.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571036>Perioperative outcomes and cost of robotic-assisted versus laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.</a></h2><p>Utilization of robotic-assisted inguinal hernia repair (IHR) has increased in recent years, but randomized or prospective studies comparing outcomes and cost of laparoscopic and Robotic-IHR are still lacking. With conflicting results from only five retrospective series available in the literature comparing the two approaches, the question remains whether current robotic technology provides any added benefits to treat inguinal hernias. We aimed to compare perioperative outcomes and costs of Robotic-IHR versus laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal IHR (Laparoscopic-IHR).Retrospective analysis of consecutive patients who underwent Robotic-IHR or Laparoscopic-IHR at a dedicated MIS unit in the USA from February 2015 to June 2017. Demographics, anthropometrics, the proportion of bilateral and recurrent hernias, operative details, cost, length of stay, 30-day readmissions and reoperations, and rates and severity of complications were compared.183 patients had surgery: 45 (24.6%) Robotic-IHR and 138 (75.4%) Laparoscopic-IHR. There were no differences between groups in age, gender, BMI, ASA class, the proportion of bilateral hernias and recurrent hernias, and length of stay. Operative time (Robotic-IHR: 116 ± 36 min, vs. Laparoscopic-IHR: 95±44 min, p < 0.01), reoperations (Robotic-IHR: 6.7%, vs. Laparoscopic-IHR: 0%, p = 0.01), and readmissions rates were greater for Robotic-IHR. While the overall perioperative complication rate was similar in between groups (Robotic-IHR: 28.9% vs. Laparoscopic-IHR: 18.1%, p = 0.14), Robotic-IHR was associated with a significantly greater proportion of grades III and IV complications (Robotic-IHR: 6.7% vs. Laparoscopic-IHR: 0%, p = 0.01). Total hospital cost was significantly higher for the Robotic-IHRs ($9993 vs. $5994, p < 0.01). The added cost associated with the robotic device itself was $3106 per case and the total cost of disposable supplies was comparable between the 2 groups.In the setting in which it was studied, the outcomes of Laparoscopic-IHR were significantly superior to the Robotic-IHR, at lower hospital costs.

Acquisition of brown-like features () in perivascular white adipose tissue (PVAT) may protect against obesity/cardiovascular disease. Most  studies are performed in rodents, but translation to humans would benefit from a closer animal model. Therefore, we studied the  response of ferret thoracic aortic PVAT (tPVAT) to cold. We performed global transcriptome analysis of tPVAT of 3-month-old ferrets acclimatized 1 week to 22 or 4°C, and compared the results with those of inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Immunohistochemistry was used to visualize . Transcriptome data revealed a stronger cold exposure response of tPVAT, including increased expression of key brown/brite markers, compared to subcutaneous fat. This translated into a clear white-to-brown remodeling of tPVAT, with the appearance of multilocular highly UCP1-stained adipocytes. The pathway most affected by cold exposure in tPVAT was immune response, characterized by down-regulation of immune-related genes, with cardio protective implications. On the other hand, subcutaneous fat responded to cold by increasing energy metabolism based on increased expression of fatty acid oxidation and tricarboxylic acid cycle genes, concordant with lower inguinal adipose tissue weight in cold-exposed animals. Thus, ferret tPVAT responds to cold acclimation with a strong induction of  and immunosuppression compared to subcutaneous fat. Our results present ferrets as an accessible translational animal model displaying functional responses relevant for obesity and cardiovascular disease prevention.Copyright © 2019 Reynés, van Schothorst, Keijer, Ceresi, Oliver and Palou.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387048>Effect of high oxygen pretreatment of whole tuber on anti- of fresh-cut potato slices during storage.</a></h2><p>The surface  usually occurs on fresh-cut potato during storage.

The TTCC included panel discussions, skills development sessions, case-based workshops, and a 4-station standardized patient simulation. The authors assessed the feasibility of designing and implementing the TTCC and students' reactions and clerkship performance.The total direct costs were $3,500. Students reacted favorably and reported improved comfort on entering clerkships. Summative performance evaluations across clerkships were higher for those students who received the TTCC with simulation compared to those students who received the standard clerkship orientation (P < .001 - .04, Cohen's d range = 0.23 - 0.62).

It was demonstrated that PL can modify the optical properties of gallic acid and cause reactions and degradation of gallic acid. However, application of PL did not significantly alter the overall quality of the model gallic acid solution at low fluence levels.

ZIP7 and ZIP13 are the closest among the conserved mammalian zinc transporters. However, whether their functions are complementary remains a controversial issue. In the present study, we found that the expression of ZIP13, but not ZIP7, is elevated by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) treatment, indicating that TGF-β-mediated ZIP13 amplification is crucial for collagen production during dermal development. Genome-wide gene expression analysis revealed that ~26% of genes are dependent on either ZIP7 or ZIP13, which is greater than the ~17% of genes dependent on both of them. ZIP7 depletion induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in mesenchymal stem cells, resulting in significant inhibition of fibrogenic differentiation. However, ZIP13 depletion does not induce ER stress. Though both ZIP7 and ZIP13 contain traditional ER signal peptides for their intracellular localization, their distributions are distinct. When ZIP7 and ZIP13 are coexpressed, their localizations are distinct; ZIP7 is located on the ER, but ZIP13 is located on both the ER and Golgi, indicating that only ZIP13 is a zinc gatekeeper on the Golgi.

We observed that tanycytes produce and secrete Fgf21 and are located close to Fgf21-sensitive neurons. Fasting, likely via the increase in circulating fatty acids, regulates this central Fgf21 production. Tanycytes store palmitate in lipid droplets and oxidize it, leading to the activation of a reactive oxygen species (ROS)/p38-MAPK signaling pathway, which is essential for tanycytic Fgf21 expression upon palmitate exposure. Tanycytic Fgf21 deletion triggers an increase in lipolysis, likely due to impaired inhibition of key neurons during fasting. Mice deleted for tanycytic Fgf21 exhibit increased energy expenditure and a reduction in fat mass gain, reminiscent of a  phenotype. Our results suggest that tanycytes sense free fatty acids to maintain body lipid homeostasis through Fgf21 signaling within the hypothalamus.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It was hypothesized that children with hearing loss experience a smaller target/masker sex mismatch benefit relative to children with normal hearing due to impairments in peripheral encoding, variable access to high-quality auditory input, or both.Eighteen school-age children with sensorineural hearing loss (7 to 15 years) and 18 age-matched children with normal hearing participated in this study. Children with hearing loss were bilateral hearing aid users. Severity of hearing loss ranged from mild to severe across participants, but most had mild to moderate hearing loss. Speech recognition thresholds for disyllabic words presented in a two-talker speech masker were estimated in the sound field using an adaptive, forced-choice procedure with a picture-pointing response. Participants were tested in each of four conditions: (1) male target speech/two-male-talker masker; (2) male target speech/two-female-talker masker; (3) female target speech/two-female-talker masker; and (4) female target speech/two-male-talker masker. Children with hearing loss were tested wearing their personal hearing aids at user settings.Both groups of children showed a sex-mismatch benefit, requiring a more advantageous signal to noise ratio when the target and masker were matched in sex than when they were mismatched. However, the magnitude of sex-mismatch benefit was significantly reduced for children with hearing loss relative to age-matched children with normal hearing. There was no effect of child age on the magnitude of sex-mismatch benefit. The sex-mismatch benefit was larger for male target speech than for female target speech. For children with hearing loss, the magnitude of sex-mismatch benefit was not associated with degree of hearing loss or aided audibility.The findings from the present study indicate that children with sensorineural hearing loss are able to capitalize on acoustic differences between speech produced by male and female talkers when asked to recognize target words in a competing speech masker. However, children with hearing loss experienced a smaller benefit relative to their peers with normal hearing. No association between the sex-mismatch benefit and measures of unaided thresholds or aided audibility were observed for children with hearing loss, suggesting that reduced peripheral encoding is not the only factor responsible for the smaller sex-mismatch benefit relative to children with normal hearing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480627>Lyophilized Maqui () Berry Induces  in the Subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue and Ameliorates the Insulin Resistance in High Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>Maqui () berry features a unique profile of anthocyanidins that includes high amounts of delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside-5-O-glucoside and delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside and has shown positive effects on fasting glucose and insulin levels in humans and murine models of type 2 diabetes and obesity. The molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of maqui on the onset and development of the obese phenotype and insulin resistance was investigated in high fat diet-induced obese mice supplemented with a lyophilized maqui berry. Maqui-dietary supplemented animals showed better insulin response and decreased weight gain but also a differential expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, multilocular lipid droplet formation and thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT). These changes correlated with an increased expression of the carbohydrate response element binding protein b (), the sterol regulatory binding protein 1c () and Cellular repressor of adenovirus early region 1A-stimulated genes 1 () and an improvement in the fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) signaling. Our evidence suggests that maqui dietary supplementation activates the induction of fuel storage and thermogenesis characteristic of a brown-like phenotype in scWAT and counteracts the unhealthy metabolic impact of an HFD. This induction constitutes a putative strategy to prevent/treat diet-induced obesity and its associated comorbidities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670550>Confirmatory factor analyses of the Baylor Revision of the Motivation to Read Survey (B-MRS) with middle school students.</a></h2><p>Reading depends on the integration of both cognitive and motivational factors, yet reading motivation has received little attention in the research literature.

A sensory study with consumers (n= 74) performed an intensity level evaluation test analyzing: color, hardness, adhesiveness, gumminess, sweet taste and honey taste. A penalty analysis indicated that HPGJ was too hard. However, in the global acceptance study more than 90% of consumers gave liking categories. Regarding the potential functional properties, the antioxidant capacity (AC) of HPGJ was 8.17 ± 0.55 mmol eqTrolox/kg, and up to 40% AC was retained after in vitro digestion. Additionally, AC of HPGJ was up to 10 times higher than that of similar commercial products. A storage study at 25°C showed that color and AC significantly increased along 90 days due to the development of Maillard reaction. Storage under darkness allowed keeping low values of global color change up to 45 days. Another positive facet was that the addition of propolis delayed the fungal growth during storage.An organoleptically palatable gummy jelly was obtained. Among the positive features, it showed higher AC than similar commercial candies. Additionally, HPGJ offered a high bioaccesible AC input detected upon in vitro digestion. Overall, HPGJ could be considered an interesting, appetizing and healthier alternative to regular gummy jellies available in the market. Adequate packaging should be considered in order to extend HPGJ shelf life, reducing  reactions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.This article is protected by copyright.

At high latitudes, increased ocean temperature is suggested to advance the spring phytoplankton bloom due to earlier stabilization of the water column. However, climate warming is also expected to cause  in lakes and rivers due to increases in terrestrial greening, ultimately reducing water clarity in coastal areas where freshwater drain. In shallow areas, decreased retention of sediments on the seabed will add to this effect. Both  and resuspension of sediments imply a reduction of the euphotic zone and Sverdrup's critical depth leading to a delay in the spring bloom, counteracting the effect of increasing temperature. Here, we provide evidence that such a transparency reduction has already taken place in both the deep and shallow areas of the North Sea during the 20th century. A sensitivity analysis using a water column model suggests that the reduced transparency might have caused up to 3 weeks delay in the spring bloom over the last century. This delay stands in contrast to the earlier bloom onset expected from global warming, thus highlighting the importance of including changing water transparency in analyses of phytoplankton phenology and primary production. This appears to be of particular relevance for coastal waters, where increased concentrations of absorbing and scattering substances (sediments, dissolved organic matter) have been suggested to lead to coastal darkening.© 2019 The Authors.

There are different types of body fats such as white adipose tissue (WAT), which stores surplus energy in the body, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) which utilize energy to produce heat during metabolism. BAT acts many beneficial functions in metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes and obesity. Recent studies have investigated methods for promoting the fat  process of WAT in obesity because of various reasons such as the improvement of insulin resistance, and weight loss. Among natural polyphenolic compounds, resveratrol has been highlighted due to its anti-oxidant and anti-obesity as well as anti-inflammation and anti-cancer properties. Recent studies have paid a lot of attention to that resveratrol may act as a fat  activator, involved in the secretion of many myokines and adipokines. Here, we reviewed the role of resveratrol in fat  and also the association between resveratrol and adipokines/myokines in the fat  process. Our review may provide novel insight into the role of resveratrol in fat , leading to the maintenance of a healthy weight against obesity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Recently, we and others found that  of white adipose tissue (WAT) is a critical component of this complex detrimental response. Although  and inflammation have been independently delineated to occur after injury, their interaction is currently not well defined. One of the master regulators of inflammation and adipose tissue remodeling after burns is nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. The aim of this this study was to determine whether NLRP3 modulates and activates WAT  after burn. To obtain molecular and mechanistic insights, we used an NLRP3 knockout (NLRP3) murine burn model. We demonstrated that genetic deletion of NLRP3 promoted persistent and augmented  in adipocytes, evidenced by increased gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and  at 3 days (5.74 vs. 0.29,  < 0.05; 26.0 vs. 0.71,  < 0.05) and uncoupling protein 1 () and  at 7 days (7,406 vs. 3,894,  < 0.05; 20.6 vs. 2.52,  < 0.01) and enhanced UCP1 staining and multilocularity. Additionally, the main regulator of postburn WAT , IL-6, was elevated in the plasma acutely after burn in NLRP3 compared with wild-type counterparts (478.9 vs. 67.1 pg/mL,  < 0.05 at 3 days). These results suggest that NLRP3 has antibrowning effects and that blocking NLRP3 increases thermogenesis and augments  via increased levels of IL-6. Our findings provide insights into targeting innate inflammatory systems for regulation of adaptive thermogenesis, a critical response after burns and other hypermetabolic conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31463804>Awareness of relative CT utilization among peers is not associated with changes in imaging requests among emergency department providers in a large county hospital.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this quality improvement initiative was to study the effect of providing scorecards to emergency department providers to assess its effect on changes in utilization.CT of the abdomen and pelvis, CT angiogram of the chest for pulmonary embolism, and CT of the head were targeted due to ordering variability, cost, and radiation exposure.

Shortage of manpower and increasing labor costs are the main incentives to mechanizing the harvesting of table olives. One of the major limiting factors in adopting mechanical harvest of table olives is the injury to fruit during mechanical harvest, which lowers the quality of the final product. In this study, we used the Israeli germplasm collection of olive cultivars at the Volcani Institute to screen the sensitivity of many olive cultivars to browning in response to injury. The browning process after induced mechanical injury was characterized in 106 olive cultivars. The proportional area of brown coloring after injury, compared to the total fruit surface area, ranged from 0 to 83.61%. Fourteen cultivars were found to be resistant to browning and did not show any brown spot 3 h after application of pressure. Among them, there are some cultivars that can serve as table olives. The different response to mechanical damage shown by the cultivars could be mainly due to genetic differences. Mesocarp cells in the fruits of the sensitive cultivars were damaged and missing the cell wall as a result of the applied pressure. The cuticles of resistant cultivars were thicker compared to those of susceptible cultivars. Finally, we showed that the browning process is enzymatic. We suggest cuticle thickness as an indicator of table olive cultivars suitable for mechanical harvest. A shift to browning-resistant cultivars in place of the popular cultivars currently in use will enable the mechanical harvest of table olive without affecting fruit quality.Copyright © 2019 Goldental-Cohen, Biton, Many, Ben-Sason, Zemach, Avidan and Ben-Ari.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655473>Analysis of factors related to  of Dangshan pear (Pyrus spp.) wine.</a></h2><p>The effects of different dissolved oxygen concentrations (DOC) on the  degree, amino acids, total phenols, reducing sugars, polyphenoloxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) of pear wine, and the relationship between various quality indicators and  degree were investigated.

Recent studies showed that Gui Zhi Tang has the effect of regulating the body temperature. In order to better exert the effect of heat production, and protect the vital organs of the body to avoid damage to the cold environment, Jiang Gui Fang (JG) was obtained from clinical utilization in the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine at General Hospital of Northern Theater Command for many years and has exhibited favorable efficacy. This formula was an empirical formula that was developed based on the research of Gui Zhi Tang, the principles of traditional Chinese medicine and survey a large number of literature. The basis for compatibility of JG was that we selected dried ginger, cassia twig, and licorice in Gui Zhi Tang, which play a major role in the treatment of exogenous cold, and combined with other Chinese medicines, such as pueraria, spatholobus, acanthopanacis cortex, euodiae fructus, codonopsis pilosula.To promote the increase of core temperature of the body and prevent invasion of the major organs from cold environment. We studied the effect of JG on the core body temperature of mice, then explored its regulation of interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) and epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and the possible mechanism. Finally, we determine phytochemical compositions of JG that play a role in heat production.For in vivo studies, we performed a 4-week treatment of JG in acute cold environment at -20 °C and chronic cold exposure at 4 °C. The core temperature, adipose tissue weight, serum parameters, and morphological observation of adipocytes, liver and kidney were measured. Then we investigated the expression levels of adipogenic factors, thermogenic factors and lipoprotein. In vitro, we determined the lipid droplet content, ATP content, and the maximum oxygen consumption of mitochondria.JG treatment promoted core temperature, inhibited eWAT weight, protected kidney, consumed glucose and lipids in Kunming (KM) mice. It also enhanced BAT-associated thermogenic factor uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and peroxisome proliferator-actived receptorγ coactivator-1α (PGC1α). The expressions of the lipogenic factor peroxisome proliferate-activator receptor gamma (PPARγ) and lipolytic protein hormone-sensitive triglyceride lipase (HSL) in eWAT were elevated. H&E and immunohistochemistry showed that JG significantly reduced the size of iBAT and eWAT, elevated UCP1 expression levels. In vitro, JG lowered the content of lipid droplets and ATP in brown fat cells. Maximum oxygen consumption capacity of mitochondria and the expression levels of UCP1, PGC1α and silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) were enhanced after JG treatment.In vivo and in vitro studies showed that JG obviously increased the core temperature of mice by activating iBAT and inducing eWAT . The mechanism depended on the PPARγ/SIRT1-PGC1α pathway. Our results will provide a reference for further study of iBAT activation and eWAT  to heat production.Copyright © 2019.

Tyrosine kinase substrate with four Src homology 3 domains (Tks4) is a scaffold protein that establishes a platform for signaling cascade molecules during podosome formation and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Several lines of evidence have also suggested that Tks4 has a role in adipocyte biology; however, its roles in the various types of adipocytes at the cellular level and in transcriptional regulation have not been studied. Therefore, we hypothesized that Tks4 functions as an organizing molecule in signaling networks that regulate adipocyte homeostasis. Our aims were to study the white and brown adipose depots of Tks4 knockout (KO) mice using immunohistology and western blotting and to analyze gene expression changes regulated by the white, brown, and beige adipocyte-related transcription factors via a PCR array. Based on morphological differences in the Tks4-KO adipocytes and increased uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of Tks4-KO mice, we concluded that the beigeing process was more robust in the WAT of Tks4-KO mice compared to the wild-type animals. Furthermore, in the Tks4-KO WAT, the expression profile of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)-regulated adipogenesis-related genes was shifted in favor of the appearance of beige-like cells. These results suggest that Tks4 and its downstream signaling partners are novel regulators of adipocyte functions and PPARγ-directed white to beige adipose tissue conversion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387271>Relationship of the Phytochemicals from Coffee and Cocoa By-Products with their Potential to Modulate Biomarkers of Metabolic Syndrome In Vitro.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to compare the phytochemicals from coffee and cocoa by-products and their relationship with the potential for reducing markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, adipogenesis, and insulin resistance in vitro. We characterized the phytochemical profile of extracts from coffee husk, coffee silverskin, and cocoa shell and evaluated their in vitro biological activity in RAW264.7 macrophages and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Pearson correlations and principal component regressions were performed to find the contribution of phytochemicals and underlying mechanisms of action. Coffee husk and silverskin extracts were mainly composed of caffeine and chlorogenic acid. Major components in cocoa shell included theobromine and protocatechuic acid. Both coffee and cocoa by-product extracts effectively reduced inflammatory markers in macrophages and adipocytes (NO, PGE, TNF-α, MCP-1, and IL-6) and the production of reactive oxygen species (21.5-66.4%). Protocatechuic and chlorogenic acids, together with caffeine, were suggested as main contributors against inflammation and oxidative stress. Furthermore, extracts reduced lipid accumulation (4.1-49.1%) in adipocytes by regulating lipolysis and inducing adipocyte . Gallic and chlorogenic acids were associated with reduced adipogenesis, and caffeine with adipocyte . Extracts from coffee and cocoa by-products also modulated the phosphorylation of insulin receptor signaling pathway and stimulated GLUT-4 translocation (52.4-72.9%), increasing glucose uptake. The insulin-sensitizing potential of the extracts was mainly associated with protocatechuic acid. For the first time, we identified the phytochemicals from coffee and cocoa by-products and offered new insights into their associations with biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, adipogenesis, and insulin resistance in vitro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555811>Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 interacts with PGC1α and modulates thermogenic fat activation.</a></h2><p>Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are enzymes that regulate the evolutionarily-conserved process of arginine methylation. It has been reported that PRMTs are involved in many metabolic regulatory pathways. However, until now, their roles in adipocyte function, especially  and thermogenesis, have not been evaluated. Even though Prmt1 adipocyte-specific deleted mice (Prmt1fl/flAQcre) appeared normal at basal level, following cold exposure or β-adrenergic stimulation, impaired induction of the thermogenic program was observed in both the interscapular brown adipose tissue and inguinal white adipose tissue of Prmt1fl/flAQcre mice compared to littermate controls. Different splicing variants of Prmt1 have been reported. Among them, PRMT1V1 and PRMT1V2 are well-conserved between humans and mice. Both variants contribute to the activation of thermogenic fat, with PRMT1V2 playing a more dominant role. Mechanistic studies using cultured murine and human adipocytes revealed that PRMT1V2 mediates thermogenic fat activation through PGC1α, a transcriptional coactivator that has been shown to play a key role in mitochondrial biogenesis. Our data are the first to demonstrate that PRMT1 plays a regulatory role in thermogenic fat function. These findings suggest that modulating PRMT1 activity may represent new avenues to regulate thermogenic fat and mediate energy homeostasis. This function is conserved in human primary adipocytes, suggesting that further investigation of this pathway may ultimately lead to therapeutic strategies against human obesity and associated metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608562>The Janus Face of Cereals: Wheat-Derived Prebiotics Counteract the Detrimental Effect of Gluten on Metabolic Homeostasis in Mice Fed a High Fat/High Sucrose Diet.</a></h2><p>Cereals are important sources of carbohydrates, but also contain nutrients that could impact adiposity. We analyzed the contribution of gluten on obesity and the effects of prebiotics -arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides (AXOS) and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS)- that can be extracted from gluten-containing cereals.Mice were fed a control diet, Western diet (WD, consisting of high fat/high sucrose), or WD with 5% gluten. Prebiotics were tested in the WD with gluten. Gluten did not increase body weight or intestinal permeability and had a minor effect on ileal inflammation. Gluten decreased the expression of  markers in the fat, and increased the triglycerides synthesis in the muscle. AXOS decreased body weight and adiposity in fat pads muscle and liver compared to the WD plus gluten. AXOS promoted gluten cleavage by the induction of prolyl endopeptidase that was translated into a reduction of gluten immunogenic peptides. Gluten had minor effects on cecal microbiota composition, whereas prebiotics increased Bifidobacterium, Butyricicoccus, Prevotella and Parasutterella, all negatively correlated to the cecal content of gluten peptides.While gluten may affect metabolic homeostasis, these effects are lessened when gluten is consumed along with cereal-derived fibers.

Alongside widespread neuronal pathology, both HD patients and the R6/2 mouse model of HD exhibit weight loss and increased energy expenditure, providing a rationale for targeting whole-body energy metabolism in HD. Leptin-deficient mice display low energy expenditure and increased body weight. We therefore hypothesized that normalizing energy metabolism in R6/2 mice, utilizing leptin- deficiency, would lead to a slower disease progression in the R6/2 mouse. In this study, we show that R6/2 mice on a leptin-deficient genetic background display increased body weight and increased fat mass compared to R6/2 mice, as well as wild type littermates. The increased body weight was accompanied by low energy expenditure, illustrated by a reduction in respiratory exchange rate. Leptin-deficient R6/2 mice had large white adipocytes with white adipocyte gene expression characteristics, in contrast to white adipose tissue in R6/2 mice, where white adipose tissue showed signs of . Leptin-deficient R6/2 mice did not exhibit improved neuropathological measures.

We recently reported a paradox, in which a conditional estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) mutant mouse shows a hyper-metabolic phenotype with enhanced brown/beige cell formation ("/beiging"). These observations led us to consider that although systemic deficiency of estrogen or ERα in mice results in obesity and glucose intolerance at room temperature, cold exposure might induce enhanced /beiging and improve glucose metabolism. Remarkably, studying cold-exposure in mouse models of inhibited estrogen signaling - ERαKO mice, ovariectomy, and treatment with the ERα antagonist Fulvestrant - supported this notion. ERα/estrogen-deficient mice demonstrated enhanced cold-induced beiging, reduced adiposity and improved glucose tolerance. Fulvestrant was also effective in diet-induced obesity settings. Mechanistically, ERα inhibition sensitized cell-autonomous beige cell differentiation and stimulation, including β3-adrenoreceptor-dependent adipocyte beiging. Taken together, our findings highlight a therapeutic potential for obese/diabetic postmenopausal patients; cold exposure is therefore predicted to metabolically benefit those patients.© 2019 Lapid et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31339170>Myricanol modulates skeletal muscle-adipose tissue crosstalk to alleviate high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Skeletal muscle is the predominant site for glucose disposal and fatty acid consumption. Emerging evidence indicates that the crosstalk between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle is critical in maintaining insulin sensitivity and lipid homeostasis. The current study was designed to investigate whether myricanol improves insulin sensitivity and alleviates adiposity through modulating skeletal muscle-adipose tissue crosstalk.The therapeutic effect of myricanol was evaluated on palmitic acid (PA)-treated C2C12 myotubes and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. The crosstalk between myotubes and adipocytes was evaluated using Transwell assay. The cellular lipid content was examined by Nile red staining. The mitochondrial content was assessed by MitoTracker Green staining and citrate synthase activity, and the mitochondrial function was examined by Seahorse assay. Expression of mitochondria-related and insulin signalling pathway proteins was analysed by Western blot, and the irisin level was determined by elisa kit.Myricanol increased mitochondrial quantity and function through activating AMP-activated protein kinase, resulting in reduced lipid accumulation and enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, in PA-treated C2C12 myotubes. Furthermore, myricanol stimulated irisin production and secretion from myotubes to reduce lipid content in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In HFD-fed mice, myricanol treatment alleviated adiposity and insulin resistance through enhancing lipid utilization and irisin production in skeletal muscle and inducing  of inguinal fat.Myricanol modulates skeletal muscle-adipose tissue crosstalk, to stimulate  of adipose tissue and improve insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. Myricanol might be a potential candidate for treating insulin resistance and obesity.© 2019 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511465>Influence of Protein Hydrolysis on the Freeze-thaw Stability of Emulsions Prepared with Soy Protein - Dextran Conjugates.</a></h2><p>Protein hydrolysis on the freeze-thaw stability of emulsions prepared with soy protein - dextran conjugates were investigated. Soy protein isolate-dextran (SPI-D) and soy protein hydrolysates-dextran (SPH-D) conjugates with different degree of hydrolysis (DH) were formed by Maillard reaction. The formation of protein-polysaccharide conjugates between SPI/SPH and dextran molecules was confirmed by SDS-PAGE; this finding was consistent with the degree of glycation and the  index. The freeze-thaw emulsion stability was investigated. The results confirmed that the SPH3-D (DH at 3%) emulsion with 3% DH of SPI exhibited the lowest creaming index after experiencing 1, 2, and 3 freeze-thaw cycles , with results of 7.69%, 20.74% and 31.30%, respectively. The SPH3-D emulsion had a significantly lower average particle size, which was reduced by 48.28% compared to the SPI-D emulsion. Meanwhile, the SPH3-D solution had low interfacial tension. The confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis indicated that the SPH3-D emulsions were strongly stable against the freeze-thaw treatment and could be used as effective emulsifiers in frozen foods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31476398>Synergistic effect of a novel chitosan/silica nanocomposites-based formulation against gray mold of table grapes and its possible mode of action.</a></h2><p>Ecofriendly nanostructured materials have been proposed as promising alternative control means to prevent plant diseases. Chitosan nanoparticles (CN), silica nanoparticles (SN) and chitosan-silica nanocomposites (CSN) were synthesized and their morphology and structure was characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared spectra (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy. Their antifungal efficiency against Botrytis cinerea, the causal fungus of gray mold disease of table grapes, was tested in vitro and in vivo (under artificial and natural infections). In vitro tests showed that CN, SN and CSN reduced fungal growth by 72, 76 and 100%, respectively at 1% as compared to control. Under natural infection, at the end of cold storage, CSN was the most effective treatment, and reduced the development of gray mold by 59 and 83%, for 'Italia' and 'Benitaka' grapes, respectively as compared to the water control. Results indicate that a synergistic effect of CSN against gray mold was observed. The impact of tested nanocomposites on soluble solids - TSS, titratable acidity - TA, TSS/TA, berry color, mass loss, stem  and shattered berries was investigated. No negative effect of tested nanomaterials in term of grape quality was observed. For 'Italia' table grape, CN and CSN can preserve bunches from mass loss as compared to control. Also, the effect of CSN on reactive species of oxygen (ROS), ATP content and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of B. cinerea spores was determined to verify its mode of action. The obtained results suggested CSN, as alternative control means, to reduce/substitute the use of fungicides to control gray mold of table grapes while maintaining grape quality.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In 4 patients (36%), daily dosing was 5 mg/kg or less based on real weight and 6.5 mg/kg or less based on ideal weight. In 3 patients (27%), daily dosing was 5 mg/kg or less based on real weight and more than 6.5 mg/kg based on ideal weight. No patient had daily dosing of more than 5 mg/kg based on real weight and 6.5 mg/kg or less based on ideal weight.Twenty-seven percent of cases of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy in obese women had ostensibly safe dosing based on 2016 AAO guidelines. Overdosing of obese women by 2016 AAO guidelines is not rare. Daily dosing based on the older 6.5-mg/kg ideal weight threshold is safer in women with a body mass index of 30 kg/m or more.Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

This phenomenon has implications to aquatic ecosystem function and biogeochemical carbon cycling. While recovery from acidification and changes in climate related variables, such as precipitation and length of growing season, are recognized as drivers behind , land-use change has received less attention. In this study we include all of the above factors and aim to discern their individual and combined contribution to water color variation in an unprecedentedly long (1940-2016) and highly resolved dataset (~20 times per month), from a river in southern Sweden. Water color showed high seasonal variability and a marked long term increase particularly in the latter half of the dataset (~1980). Short term and seasonal variation were best explained by precipitation, with temperature playing a secondary role. All explanatory variables (precipitation, temperature, S deposition and land-use change) contributed significantly and together predicted 75% of the long-term variation in the water color. Long term change was best explained by a pronounced increase in Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst) volume - a measure of land-use change and a proxy for build-up of organic soil layers - and by change in atmospheric S deposition. When modeling water color with a combination of explanatory variables, Norway spruce showed the highest contribution to explaining long term variability. This study highlights the importance of considering land-use change as a factor behind  and combining multiple factors when making predictions in water color and dissolved organic carbon.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655089>Preadipocyte factor 1 regulates adipose tissue browning via TNF-α-converting enzyme-mediated cleavage.</a></h2><p>Increasing adaptive thermogenesis in adipose tissue may be a potential therapeutic target for overcoming obesity and obesity-related disorders. Preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref-1), a preadipocyte secreted protein, plays an inhibitory role in adipogenic differentiation. However, the role of Pref-1 in adipose tissue browning remains unknown. We investigated whether Pref-1 regulates thermogenic program and beige  biogenesis.Pref-1 expression levels were examined in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes in thermogenic conditions induced by cold exposure or a beta-adrenergic stimulus (CL316,243). Overexpression and knockdown studies were performed both in vivo and in vitro to clarify the role of Pref-1 in iWAT browning.Cold exposure or CL316,243 induced a thermogenic program in adipose tissue of C57BL/6N mice and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Notably, Pref-1 levels were down-regulated in iWAT and adipocytes under these conditions. Overexpressing Pref-1 showed reduced thermogenic gene expressions in response to CL316,243 treatment, whereas depletion of Pref-1 augmented thermogenic program in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Correspondingly, treating C57BL/6N mice with Pref-1 resulted in reduced expression of thermogenic and beige  markers, a reduced rate of oxygen consumption, blunting of UCP1 expression and beige  formation in iWAT in response to cold exposure or CL316,243 injection compared to the untreated mice. The opposite phenotype was observed in mice with inducible -specific knock-out of Pref-1. Mechanistically, these effects were regulated by modulation of TNF-α-converting enzyme activity and Pref-1 cleavage.Our findings establish a novel role of Pref-1 that regulates adaptive thermogenesis. This offers a unique target for improving energy homeostasis and treating obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p></html>
