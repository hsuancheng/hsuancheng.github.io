In addition, co-morbidities such as gastro-intestinal problems have frequently been reported. Mutations and deletion of proteins of the SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains () gene-family were identified in patients with ASD, and  knock-out mouse models display autism-like phenotypes. SHANK3 proteins are not only expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we show expression in gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium and report a significantly different GI morphology in  knock-out (KO) mice. Further, we detected a significantly altered microbiota composition measured in feces of  KO mice that may contribute to inflammatory responses affecting brain development. In line with this, we found higher  lipopolysaccharide levels in liver samples of  KO mice, and detected an increase in Interleukin-6 and activated astrocytes in  KO mice. We conclude that apart from its well-known role in the CNS, SHANK3 plays a specific role in the GI tract that may contribute to the ASD phenotype by extracerebral mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30227645>⁻Liver Axis: How Do  Bacteria Influence the Liver?</a></h1><p>Chronic liver diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recently,  dysbiosis was identified as an important factor in the pathogenesis of liver diseases. The relationship between  microbiota and the liver is still not well understood; however, dysfunction of the  mucosal barrier (" ") and increased bacterial translocation into the liver via the ⁻liver axis probably play crucial roles in liver disease development and progression. The liver is an important immunological organ, and, after exposure to -derived bacteria via portal circulation, it responds with activation of the innate and adaptive immune system, leading to hepatic injury. A better understanding of the pathophysiological links among  dysbiosis, the integrity of the  barrier, and the hepatic immune response to -derived factors is essential for the development of new therapies to treat chronic liver diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28950280>Type 2 Diabetes and Bacteremia.</a></h1><p>A high proportion of type 2 diabetes cases are associated with host genetic and environmental factors. During the past decade, microorganisms that inhabit the  have emerged as contributors to the pathogenesis of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, manipulation of the human  microbiota will provide essential clues regarding new therapeutic targets for diabetes.Several studies have established the presence of  dysbiosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, even though there are some differences among the studies that could be explained by differences in ethnicity, diet, and methodology.  dysbiosis affects the quality and quantity of short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids that act as signaling molecules in energy, glucose, and lipid metabolism. In addition,  dysbiosis affect intestinal permeability. In particular, a high-fat diet can lead to changes in the  microbiota that strongly reduce intestinal permeability due to the malfunction of tight junction proteins, such as occludin and ZO-1 [<citeref rid="ref1">1</citeref>]. The formation of   results in increased plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide, which activate Toll-like receptor 4 and result in innate and adaptive immune responses [<citeref rid="ref2">2</citeref>].

Because of their low-fiber and high-fat and sugar composition, these foodstuffs could induce a negative impact on health. They are partially responsible for obesity and chronic non-transmissible diseases; additionally, they could impact in the prevalence of autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and celiac disease. The rationale is that the nutritional composition of ultra-processed foodstuffs can induce  dysbiosis, promoting a pro-inflammatory response and consequently, a " ". These factors have been associated with increased risk of autoimmunity in genetically predisposed children. In addition, food emulsifiers, commonly used in ultra-processed products could modify the  microbiota and intestinal permeability, which could increase the risk of autoimmunity. In contrast, unprocessed and minimally processed food-based diets have shown the capacity to promote  microbiota eubiosis, anti-inflammatory response, and epithelial integrity, through bacterial butyrate production. Thus, to decrease the susceptibility to autoimmunity, genetically predisposed children should avoid ultra-processed food products and encourage the consumption of fresh and minimally processed foods.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30930689>Immune Dysfunction and Albumin-Related Immunity in Liver Cirrhosis.</a></h1><p>Liver cirrhosis yearly causes 1.2 million deaths worldwide, ranking as the 10th leading cause of death in the most developed countries. High susceptibility to infections along with a significant risk for infection-related mortality justifies the description of liver cirrhosis as the world's most common immunodeficiency syndrome. Liver cirrhosis is an end-stage organic disease hallmarked by a multifaceted immune dysfunction due to deterioration of antimicrobial recognition and elimination mechanisms in macrophages along with an impaired antigen presentation ability in circulating monocytes. Bacterial translocation supports-and is supported by-uncontrolled activation of immune cell responses and/or loss of toll-like receptor (TLR) tolerance, which can turn exaggerated inflammatory responses to systemic inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or endotoxin boosts systemic inflammatory activity through activation of TLR-2- and TLR-4-dependent pathways and facilitate a massive production of cytokines. This, in turn, results into elevated secretion of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further enhances intestinal hyperpermeability and thus sustains a vicious circle of events widely known as " ." Albumin can be of particular benefit in cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and/or hepatorenal syndrome type of acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI) due to anti-inflammatory and antioxidative stress as well as volume-expanding properties and endothelial-stabilizing attributes. However, presence of autoantibodies against albumin in patients with liver cirrhosis has been described. Although previous research suggested that these antibodies should be regarded as naturally occurring antibodies (NOA), the origin of the antialbumin immune response is obscure. High occurrence of NAO/albumin complexes in patients with liver disease might reflect a limited clearance capacity due to bypassing portal circulation. Moreover, high burden of oxidized albumin is associated with less favorable outcome in patients with liver cirrhosis. To date, there is no data available as to whether oxidized forms of albumin result in neoepitopes recognized by the immune system. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to hypothesize that these alterations may have the potential to induce antialbumin immune responses and thus favor systemic inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30342142>Natural polysaccharides exhibit anti-tumor activity by targeting  microbiota.</a></h1><p>Natural polysaccharides, the abundant dietary components, show potent antitumor bioactivity in treatment and chemoprevention. Compared with traditional tumor therapy, natural polysaccharides are characterized by the low toxicity and immuno-regulation function. Recent researches have indicated that the anti-tumor of polysaccharides was partly attributable to modification in the composition of  microbiota when polysaccharides were digested. Indeed, microbial dysbiosis or alteration of certain bacterial species has been reported in tumorigenesis. Natural polysaccharides intake can reverse such changes by enriching health-promoting bacteria and metabolite the intestine. In this review, we first summarize current knowledge on the anti-tumor activity of polysaccharides, and demonstrate the relationship between bacteria and metabolite in the intestine tumorigenesis and microbial dysbiosis. Thereafter, and the "polysaccharides- microbiota" is put forward for polysaccharides to exhibit their antitumor activity, which may attribute to the improved  , avoided hypernutrition, and reinforced immune homeostasis, finally creating a systemic environment to lower the risks of tumor.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Psychological stress can activate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) with subsequent hypercortisolemia. It can also influence intestinal permeability and dynamics of IgG response. Major depression can by accompanied either by activation of inflammatory response or by immune suppression (e.g. decreased antibody production) where hypercortisolemia is a significant immune modulator. The aim of our study was to assess IgG immune response against 44 food products in depressed patients and controls along with markers of psychological stress, inflammation, psychometric and dietary parameters.Serum IgG concentrations against 44 food antigens, plasma cortisol, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1b concentrations were measured and psychometric parameters were evaluated using Hamilton Depression Rating (HAM-D 17), Perceived Stress (PSS-10), and Symptom Checklist (SCL-90) scales in 34 depressed patients and 29 controls. Dietary parameters such as frequency of exposure to food antigens, appetite and weight change were assessed.There was a significantly lower IgG concentration against dairy in depressed patients compared to controls (post hoc p < 0.05) when there was a high exposure (consumption) to dairy. Our research revealed a significant interaction of IgG concentration against dairy proteins and exposure to dairy between groups (F (2.63) = 3.92, p = 0.025, η = 0.12). There was no significant difference in mean IgG concentration against food antigens between patients and controls. We found increased concentration of cortisol in depressed patients (t (1.61) = 2.37, p = 0.02) compared to controls. Patients with melancholic depression had significantly higher (M   = 21.27) concentration of cortisol (U = 41, p = 0.006), when compared with the non-melancholic group of patients (M   = 12.16). Cortisol concentration significantly positively correlated with HAM-D 17 (r = 0.442, p = 0.009) and with phobias in SCL-90 scale in patients' group (r = 0.531, p = 0.001). There was decreased concentration of TNF-α (t = 4.256, p < 0.001) in depressed patients compared to controls. IgG concentration of 38.63% food products positively correlated with TNF-α concentration in depressed patients compared to 9.09% of those in healthy controls.We observed an immune suppression of IgG response to dairy proteins in depressed patients. Hypercortisolemia with involvement of decreased concentration of TNF-α might play a significant role in suppression of IgG response in depressed patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30213697>Food intolerance in patients with manifest autoimmunity. Observational study.</a></h1><p>In the professional medical and scientific world, there is not many interest in the correlation of food intolerance and autoimmune diseases. However there is a lot of evidence that e.g. gluten or gliadine can induce autoimmmune diseases: example the interest in coeliac disease and autoimmunity. There is however a lot of informationavailable about   and autoimmunity. We performed an observational study in our data base;, where we selected 100 patients with manifest autoimmune disease with clear symptoms and autoimmune antibodies in the form of positive anf more tehn 160 titer. These patients were compared with 25 control patients without any autoimmunity. We could clearly find a difference in food intolerance profiles when we compared AI patients with people without any AI. Overall there is a much greater reaction to several food epitopes, which can be observed on the level of specific antibodies tot he food epitopes. These igG levels for specific food antibodies are significantly higher in the patient group then in the control group. We can also see that some food epitopes provocate a very pronounced reaction, while other show no increased level of igG. Among the most reactive food epitopes are caseine, cow milk, wheat, gliadine, white of egg and rice. A variable reaction can bes een on nuts e.g.; walnuts and almonds. Almost no antibody reaction is noticed on vegetables, fish and meat products, who seem tob e immunologially very neutral. We conclude that food intolerance test is very important tool in patients with AI disease, and should be performed in each patient to tailor an individual diet program, which if properly followed, could relieve symptoms and probably stop or slow the the progression of the autoimmune disease. Also interesting for global research in AI disease is the fact that food is probably an important trigger for autoimmunity in vulnerable patients. More research on great scale and multicenter around this topic is mandatory and urgent.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

As there is limited literature on in vivo biomarkers to assess increased IP in chickens, the objective of this study was to identify a reliable biomarker of IP using DSS ingestion and fasting models. Male Ross chickens (n = 48) were reared until day 14 on the floor pen in an animal care facility, randomized into the following groups: control, DSS and fasting (each with n = 16), and then placed in metabolism cages. DSS was administered in drinking water at 0.75% from days 16 to 21, while controls and fasted groups received water. All birds had free access to feed and water except the birds in the fasting group that were denied feed for 19.5 h on day 20. On day 21, all chickens were given two separate oral gavages comprising fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d, 2.2 mg in 1 ml/bird) at time zero and lactulose, mannitol and rhamnose (LMR) sugars (0.25 g L, 0.05 g M and 0.05 g R in 2 ml/bird) at 60 min. Whole blood was collected from the brachial vein in a syringe 90 min post-LMR sugar gavage. Serum FITC-d and plasma LMR sugar concentrations were measured by spectrophotometry and high-performance ion chromatography respectively. Plasma concentrations of intestinal fatty acid binding protein, diamine oxidase, tight junction protein (TJP), d-lactate and faecal α-antitrypsin inhibitor concentration were also analysed by ELISA. FITC-d increased significantly (p < 0.05) after fasting compared with control. L/M and L/R ratios for fasting and L/M ratio for DSS increased compared with control chickens (p < 0.05). TJP in plasma was significantly increased due to fasting but not DSS treatment, compared with controls. Other tests did not indicate changes in IP (p > 0.05). We concluded that FITC-d and LMR sugar tests can be used in chickens to assess changes in IP.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31060311>Role of  Microbiota in Hepatocarcinogenesis.</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the leading causes of death worldwide, has a causal nexus with liver injury, inflammation, and regeneration that accumulates over decades. Observations from recent studies have accounted for the involvement of the -liver axis in the pathophysiological mechanism responsible for HCC. The human intestine nurtures a diversified colony of microorganisms residing in the host ecosystem. The intestinal barrier is critical for conserving the normal physiology of the  microbiome. Therefore, a rupture of this barrier or dysbiosis can cause the intestinal microbiome to serve as the main source of portal-vein endotoxins, such as lipopolysaccharide, in the progression of hepatic diseases. Indeed, increased bacterial translocation is a key sign of HCC. Considering the limited number of clinical studies on HCC with respect to the microbiome, we focus on clinical as well as animal studies involving the  microbiota, with the current understandings of the mechanism by which the intestinal dysbiosis promotes hepatocarcinogenesis. Future research might offer mechanistic insights into the specific phyla targeting the  , as well as microbial dysbiosis, and their metabolites, which represent key pathways that drive HCC-promoting microbiome-mediated liver inflammation and fibrosis, thereby restoring the  barrier function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30999787>Probing paracellular - transcellular tissue barrier permeability using a  mucosal explant culture system.</a></h1><p>Intestinal permeation enhancers (PEs), i.e. agents improving oral delivery of therapeutic drugs with poor bioavailability, may typically act by two principally different mechanisms: to increase either transcellular -or paracellular passage across the epithelium. With the aim to define these different modes of action in a small intestinal mucosal explant system, the transcellular-acting PE sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was compared to the paracellular-acting PE ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), using several fluorescent polar - and lipophilic probes. Here, SDS rendered the enterocyte cell membranes  for the relatively small polar tracers Lucifer yellow and a 3 kD Texas red-conjugated dextran, but most conspicuously SDS blocked constitutive endocytosis from the brush border. In contrast, the main action of EDTA was to increase paracellular passage across the epithelium of both polar probes, including 10 - and 70 kDa dextrans and lipophilic probes, visualized by distinct stripy lateral staining of enterocytes and/or accumulation in the lamina propria. In addition, EDTA caused a loss of epithelial cell polarity by opening tight junctions for diffusion of domain-specific basolateral/apical cell membrane protein markers into the opposite domains. By transmission electron microscopy, SDS caused the formation of vacuoles and vesicle-like structures at the lateral cell membranes. In contrast, EDTA led to a bulging of the whole enterocyte apex, resulting in a "cobblestone" appearance of the epithelium, probably caused by an extreme contraction of the perijunctional actomyosin ring. We conclude that the mucosal explant system is a convenient model for predicting transcellular/paracellular modes of action of novel prospective PEs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29094594>Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug-Induced   Modeled Using Polarized Monolayers of Primary Human Intestinal Epithelial Cells.</a></h1><p>The intestinal epithelium provides a critical barrier that separates the  microbiota from host tissues. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are efficacious analgesics and antipyretics and are among the most frequently used drugs worldwide. In addition to gastric damage, NSAIDs are toxic to the intestinal epithelium, causing erosions, perforations, and longitudinal ulcers in the . Here, we use a unique in vitro human primary small intestinal cell monolayer system to pinpoint the intestinal consequences of NSAID treatment. We found that physiologically relevant doses of the NSAID diclofenac (DCF) are cytotoxic because they uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and generate reactive oxygen species. We also find that DCF induces intestinal barrier permeability, facilitating the translocation of compounds from the luminal to the basolateral side of the intestinal epithelium. The results we outline here establish the utility of this novel platform, representative of the human small intestinal epithelium, to understand NSAID toxicity, which can be applied to study multiple aspects of  barrier function including defense against infectious pathogens and host-microbiota interactions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28208612>Enteric Pathogens and Their Toxin-Induced Disruption of the Intestinal Barrier through Alteration of Tight Junctions in Chickens.</a></h1><p>Maintaining a healthy  environment is a prerequisite for sustainable animal production. The  plays a key role in the digestion and absorption of nutrients and constitutes an initial organ exposed to external factors influencing bird's health. The intestinal epithelial barrier serves as the first line of defense between the host and the luminal environment. It consists of a continuous monolayer of intestinal epithelial cells connected by intercellular junctional complexes which shrink the space between adjacent cells. Consequently, free passing of solutes and water via the paracellular pathway is prevented. Tight junctions (TJs) are multi-protein complexes which are crucial for the integrity and function of the epithelial barrier as they not only link cells but also form channels allowing permeation between cells, resulting in epithelial surfaces of different tightness. Tight junction's molecular composition, ultrastructure, and function are regulated differently with regard to physiological and pathological stimuli. Both in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that reduced tight junction integrity greatly results in a condition commonly known as " ". A loss of barrier integrity allows the translocation of luminal antigens (microbes, toxins) via the mucosa to access the whole body which are normally excluded and subsequently destroys the  mucosal homeostasis, coinciding with an increased susceptibility to systemic infection, chronic inflammation and malabsorption. There is considerable evidence that the intestinal barrier dysfunction is an important factor contributing to the pathogenicity of some enteric bacteria. It has been shown that some enteric pathogens can induce permeability defects in  epithelia by altering tight junction proteins, mediated by their toxins. Resolving the strategies that microorganisms use to hijack the functions of tight junctions is important for our understanding of microbial pathogenesis, because some pathogens can utilize tight junction proteins as receptors for attachment and subsequent internalization, while others modify or destroy the tight junction proteins by different pathways and thereby provide a gateway to the underlying tissue. This review aims to deliver an overview of the tight junction structures and function, and its role in enteric bacterial pathogenesis with a special focus on chickens. A main conclusion will be that the molecular mechanisms used by enteric pathogens to disrupt epithelial barrier function in chickens needs a much better understanding, explicitly highlighted for  and . This is a requirement in order to assist in discovering new strategies to avoid damages of the intestinal barrier or to minimize consequences from infections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411319>TMA but not TMAO increases with age in rat plasma and affects smooth muscle cells viability.</a></h1><p>It has been suggested that trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), a liver oxygenation product of  bacteria-produced trimethylamine (TMA), is a marker of cardiovascular risk. However, mechanisms of the increase and biological effects of TMAO are obscure. Furthermore, the potential role of TMAO precursor, i.e. TMA has not been investigated. We evaluated the effect of age, a cardiovascular risk factor, on plasma levels of TMA and TMAO,  bacteria composition, -to-blood penetration of TMA, histological and hemodynamic parameters in 3-month-old and 18-month-old, male, Sprague-Dawley and Wistar-Kyoto rats. Cytotoxicity of TMA and TMAO was studied in human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMCs). Older rats showed significantly different  bacteria composition, a significantly higher guttoblood TMA penetration, and morphological and hemodynamic alterations in intestines. In vitro, TMA at concentration of 500 µmol/L (2-fold higher than in portal blood) decreased hVSMCs viability. In contrast, TMAO at 1000-fold higher concentration than physiological one, had no effect on hVSMCs viability. In conclusion, older rats show higher plasma level of TMA due to a " ". TMA but not TMAO affects hVSMCs viability. We propose that TMA but not TMAO may be a marker and mediator of cardiovascular risk.© The Author(s) 2019.

PTLDS represents a small subset of patients treated for an erythema migrans (EM) rash with persistent or recurrent symptoms and functional decline. The larger population with chronic Lyme disease is less understood and well defined. Multiple Systemic Infectious Disease Syndrome (MSIDS) is a multifactorial model for treating chronic disease(s), which identifies up to 16 overlapping sources of inflammation and their downstream effects.

Results indicate that dapsone combination therapy decreased the severity of eight major Lyme symptoms, and multiple sources of inflammation (other infections, immune dysfunction, autoimmunity, food allergies/sensitivities,  , mineral deficiencies, environmental toxins with detoxification problems, and sleep disorders) along with downstream effects of inflammation may all affect chronic symptomatology.

Women with RPL show higher prevalence of undiagnosed  disorders. Furthermore, in endometrial tissues of RPL women, higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and Nalp-3 inflammasome has been observed. Aim of this study was to investigate whether an abnormal  permeability might occur in RPL women and allow passage into systemic circulation of pro-inflammatory molecules able to induce endometrial inflammation.70 women with idiopathic RPL and 30 healthy women were recruited at the Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Outpatient Unit of the Gemelli Hospital of Rome from March 2013 to February 2017.

IgM responses to NO-albumin were significantly higher in BP1 and MDD than in BP2 patients. There were highly significant associations between the IgM responses to NO-adducts and IgG responses to ox-LDL and IgA/IgM responses to Gram-negative bacteria.BP1 and MDD are characterized by an upregulation of the nitrosylome (the proteome of nitrosylated proteins) and increased IgM responses to nitrosylated conjugates.

Collectively, these factors promote systemic inflammation and cardiovascular morbidity by mediating microbial dysbiosis, disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier, and translocation of endotoxin, bacterial fragments, and uremic toxins across the " " into the bloodstream. Strategies aimed at increasing dietary fiber and lowering urea burden may help to attenuate uremia-induced microbial dysbiosis and epithelial barrier breakdown, and thereby improve systemic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

However, due to its essential role in  homeostasis, therapeutic targeting of this pathway has proven challenging. Additionally, IL-6/Stat-3 signaling, activated by microbial translocation through the dysregulated mucosal barrier in colon adenomas, facilitates the adenoma to adenocarcinomas transition. However, inter-dependence between these signaling pathways and key mucosal barrier components in regulating colon tumorigenesis and cancer progression remains unclear. In current study, we have discovered, using a comprehensive investigative regimen, a novel and tissue-specific role of claudin-3, a tight junction integral protein, in inhibiting colon cancer progression by serving as the common rheostat of Stat-3 and Wnt-signaling activation. Loss of claudin-3 also predicted poor patient survival. These findings however contrasted an upregulated claudin-3 expression in other cancer types and implicated role of the epigenetic regulation. Claudin-3-/- mice revealed dedifferentiated and  colonic epithelium, and developed invasive adenocarcinoma when subjected to colon cancer. Wnt-signaling hyperactivation, albeit in GSK-3β independent manner, differentiated colon cancer in claudin-3-/- mice versus WT-mice. Claudin-3 loss also upregulated the gp130/IL6/Stat3 signaling in colonic epithelium potentially assisted by infiltrating immune components. Genetic and pharmacological studies confirmed that claudin-3 loss induces Wnt/β-catenin activation, which is further exacerbated by Stat-3-activation and help promote colon cancer. Overall, these novel findings identify claudin-3 as a therapeutic target for inhibiting overactivation of Wnt-signaling to prevent CRC malignancy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959577>Fructose Promotes  , Endotoxemia, and Liver Fibrosis Through Ethanol-Inducible Cytochrome P450-2E1-Mediated Oxidative and Nitrative Stress.</a></h1><p>Fructose intake is known to induce obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We aimed to evaluate the effects of fructose drinking on  leakiness, endotoxemia, and NAFLD and study the underlying mechanisms in rats, mice, and T84 colon cells. Levels of ileum junctional proteins, oxidative stress markers, and apoptosis-related proteins in rodents, T84 colonic cells, and human ileums were determined by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence analyses. Fructose drinking caused microbiome change,  , and hepatic inflammation/fibrosis with increased levels of nitroxidative stress marker proteins cytochrome P450-2E1 (CYP2E1), inducible nitric oxide synthase, and nitrated proteins in small intestine and liver of rodents. Fructose drinking significantly elevated plasma bacterial endotoxin levels, likely resulting from decreased levels of intestinal tight junction (TJ) proteins (zonula occludens 1, occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-4), adherent junction (AJ) proteins (β-catenin and E-cadherin), and desmosome plakoglobin, along with α-tubulin, in wild-type rodents, but not in fructose-exposed Cyp2e1-null mice. Consistently, decreased intestinal TJ/AJ proteins and increased hepatic inflammation with fibrosis were observed in autopsied obese people compared to lean individuals. Furthermore, histological and biochemical analyses showed markedly elevated hepatic fibrosis marker proteins in fructose-exposed rats compared to controls. Immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analyses revealed that intestinal TJ proteins were nitrated and ubiquitinated, leading to their decreased levels in fructose-exposed rats. Conclusion: These results showed that fructose intake causes protein nitration of intestinal TJ and AJ proteins, resulting in increased  leakiness, endotoxemia, and steatohepatitis with liver fibrosis, at least partly, through a CYP2E1-dependent manner.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29375937>Eukaryotes in the  microbiota in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.</a></h1><p>Patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) often suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms and many are diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

Exposure of macrophages to low doses of LPS causes hyporesponsiveness upon subsequent endotoxin challenge, a phenomenon termed endotoxin or LPS tolerance. In the present study, we aimed to examine whether LPS-induced lipid accumulation is affected by endotoxin tolerance. LPS pretreatment reduced the expression of proinflammatory mediators upon subsequent high-dose LPS treatment in murine livers. Total lipid and lipid class analysis indicated that LPS-induced lipid accumulation was not affected by endotoxin tolerance, although it was dependent on the presence of Kupffer cells. Analysis of the expression of lipogenic genes revealed that sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1) and its target ELOVL fatty acid elongase 6 (Elovl6) were upregulated upon LPS administration in livers from LPS-tolerant and non-tolerant mice, whereas the expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (Ppara), a key inducer of lipid degradation, was decreased. Neither Interleukin (IL)-6 expression nor the activation of its downstream effector signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 were suppressed in liver tissues of LPS-tolerized mice. In vitro experiments confirmed that recombinant or macrophage-derived IL-6 was a potent activator of the lipogenic factor STAT3 in hepatocytes. Accordingly, IL-6 treatment led to increased lipid levels in this cell type. In summary, our data show that endotoxin tolerance does not influence LPS-induced hepatic lipid accumulation and suggest that IL-6 drives hepatic lipid storage.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

The gastrointestinal tract is seldom discussed as an organ system of principal importance for metabolic diseases. The present overview connects various metabolic research lines into an integrative physiological context in which the gastrointestinal tract is included. Strong evidence for the involvement of the  in the metabolic syndrome derives from the powerful effects of weight-reducing (bariatric) gastrointestinal surgery. In fact, gastrointestinal surgery is now recommended as a standard treatment option for type 2 diabetes in obesity. Several -related mechanisms that potentially contribute to the metabolic syndrome will be presented. Obesity can be caused by hampered release of satiety-signalling  hormones, reduced meal-associated energy expenditure and microbiota-assisted harvest of energy from nondigestible food ingredients. Adiposity per se is a well-established risk factor for hyperglycaemia. In addition, a   mucosa can trigger systemic inflammation mediating peripheral insulin resistance that together with a blunted incretin response aggravates the hyperglycaemic state. The intestinal microbiota is strongly associated with obesity and the related metabolic disease states, although the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Enterorenal signalling has been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension and postprandial triglyceride-rich chylomicrons; in addition, intestinal cholesterol metabolism probably contributes to atherosclerosis. It is likely that in the future, the metabolic syndrome will be treated according to novel pharmacological principles interfering with gastrointestinal functionality.© 2016 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546668>TREM Receptors Connecting Bowel Inflammation to Neurodegenerative Disorders.</a></h1><p>Alterations in Triggering Receptors Expressed on Myeloid cells (TREM-1/2) are bound to a variety of infectious, sterile inflammatory, and degenerative conditions, ranging from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to neurodegenerative disorders. TREMs are emerging as key players in pivotal mechanisms often concurring in IBD and neurodegeneration, namely microbiota dysbiosis,  , and inflammation. In conditions of dysbiosis, compounds released by intestinal bacteria activate TREMs on macrophages, leading to an exuberant pro-inflammatory reaction up to damage in the  barrier. In turn, TREM-positive activated macrophages along with inflammatory mediators may reach the brain through the blood, glymphatic system, circumventricular organs, or the vagus nerve via the microbiota--brain axis. This leads to a systemic inflammatory response which, in turn, impairs the blood-brain barrier, while promoting further TREM-dependent neuroinflammation and, ultimately, neural injury. Nonetheless, controversial results still exist on the role of TREM-2 compared with TREM-1, depending on disease specificity, stage, and degree of inflammation. Therefore, the present review aimed to provide an update on the role of TREMs in the pathophysiology of IBD and neurodegeneration.

A healthy homeostatic intestinal barrier is pivotal for maintaining gastrointestinal health, which impacts the overall health as it safeguards the -blood axis and checks  microbes including potential pathogens from entering into the circulation.Under healthy milieus, the intestinal barrier is generally very dynamic and effective, with luminal side being heavily infested with a wide variety of  microbes while the basolateral side remains virtually sterile. However, certain conditions such as abnormal exposure to toxins, drugs, pathogens etc. or a state of hyper-inflammation due to disease conditions may weaken or destabilize the integrity of  epithelia. A perturbed  integrity and permeability (" ") may lead to microbial (bacterial) translocation, and the eventual leakage of bacteria or their metabolites into the circulation can make the host susceptible to various types of diseases via inducing chronic or acute inflammatory response. Key Message: Given a close association with  integrity, bacterial translocation and inflammatory responses have recently emerged as a clinically important research field and have unveiled novel aspects of  microbial ecology and various gastrointestinal, metabolic, and lifestyle diseases. This review aims to describe the significance of a healthy  barrier integrity and permeability, as well as the factors and consequences associated with a compromised  barrier, while discussing briefly the dietary approaches including probiotics and prebiotics that could ameliorate  health by restoring  environment and barrier integrity, thereby preventing bacterial translocation.© 2017 S.

Taking this into consideration, the aim of this contribution is to review the impact of HFD on microbiota profile and small intestinal physiology before and after the onset of obesity and its metabolic complications. Evidence from animal studies suggest that before the onset of obesity and its metabolic complications, HFD induces intestinal dysbiosis - encompassing changes in composition balance and massive redistribution with bacteria occupying intervillous spaces and crypts - associated with early physiopathological changes, predominantly in the ileum, such as low-grade inflammation, decreased antimicrobial peptides expression, impaired mucus production, secretion and layer's thickness, and decreased expression of tight junction proteins. With time, major inflammatory signals (e.g. toll-like receptor-4 dependent) become activated, thereby stimulating proinflammatory cytokines secretion in the small intestine. This inflammatory state might subsequently exacerbate disruption of the mucus layer barrier and increase epithelial permeability of the small intestine, thereby creating an environment that facilitates the passage of bacterial components (e.g. lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan and flagellin) and metabolites from the intestinal lumen (e.g. secondary bile acids) to the circulation and peripheral tissues (i.e.  ), eventually promoting the development of systemic inflammation, obesity, adiposity, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance preceding hyperglycemia. Although the mechanisms are still not completely understood, prebiotics, probiotics, polyphenols, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonists (such as rosiglitazone) and exercise have been shown to reverse HFD-induced intestinal phenotype and to attenuate the severity of obesity and its associated metabolic complications.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Lupus patients who experienced pregnancy usually had more severe disease flares post-delivery. However, the possible role of  microbiota in the link between pregnancy and exacerbation of lupus remains to be explored.In the classical lupus mouse model MRL/lpr, we compared the structures of  microbiota in pregnant and lactating individuals vs. age-matched naïve mice. Consistent with studies on non-lupus mice, both pregnancy and lactation significantly changed the composition and diversity of  microbiota. Strikingly, modulation of  microbiota using the same strategy resulted in different disease outcomes in postpartum (abbreviated as "PP," meaning that the mice had undergone pregnancy and lactation) vs. control (naïve; i.e., without pregnancy or lactation) MRL/lpr females; while vancomycin treatment attenuated lupus in naïve mice, it did not do so, or even exacerbated lupus, in PP mice. Lactobacillus animalis flourished in the  upon vancomycin treatment, and direct administration of L. animalis via oral gavage recapitulated the differential effects of vancomycin in PP vs. control mice. An enzyme called indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase was significantly inhibited by L. animalis; however, this inhibition was only apparent in PP mice, which explained, at least partially, the lack of beneficial response to vancomycin in these mice. The differential production of immunosuppressive IL-10 and proinflammatory IFNγ in PP vs. control mice further explained why the disease phenotypes varied between the two types of mice bearing the same  microbiota remodeling strategy.These results suggest that pregnancy and lactation interfere with the response of autoimmunity to modulation of  microbiota.

This role is mainly effected by the readily reversible nitrosylation of selective protein cysteine thiols. The reversibility and sophistication of this signaling system is enabled and regulated by a number of enzymes which form part of the thioredoxin, glutathione, and pyridoxine antioxidant systems. Increases in nitric oxide levels initially lead to a defensive increase in the number of nitrosylated proteins in an effort to preserve their function. However, in an environment of chronic oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS), nitrosylation of crucial cysteine groups within key enzymes of the thioredoxin, glutathione, and pyridoxine systems leads to their inactivation thereby disabling denitrosylation and transnitrosylation and subsequently a state described as "hypernitrosylation." This state leads to the development of pathology in multiple domains such as the inhibition of enzymes of the electron transport chain, decreased mitochondrial function, and altered conformation of proteins and amino acids leading to loss of immune tolerance and development of autoimmunity. Hypernitrosylation also leads to altered function or inactivation of proteins involved in the regulation of apoptosis, autophagy, proteomic degradation, transcription factor activity, immune-inflammatory pathways, energy production, and neural function and survival. Hypernitrosylation, as a consequence of chronically elevated O&NS and activated immune-inflammatory pathways, can explain many characteristic abnormalities observed in neuroprogressive disease including major depression and chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis. In those disorders, increased bacterial translocation may drive hypernitrosylation and autoimmune responses against nitrosylated proteins.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332013>Plant defenses interact with insect enteric bacteria by initiating a   syndrome.</a></h1><p>Plants produce suites of defenses that can collectively deter and reduce herbivory. Many defenses target the insect digestive system, with some altering the protective peritrophic matrix (PM) and causing increased permeability. The PM is responsible for multiple digestive functions, including reducing infections from potential pathogenic microbes. In our study, we developed axenic and gnotobiotic methods for fall armyworm () and tested how particular members present in the  community influence interactions with plant defenses that can alter PM permeability. We observed interactions between  bacteria with plant resistance. Axenic insects grew more but displayed lower immune-based responses compared with those possessing , , and  isolates from field-collected larvae. While  bacteria reduced performance of larvae fed on plants, none of the isolates produced mortality when injected directly into the hemocoel. Our results strongly suggest that plant physical and chemical defenses not only act directly upon the insect, but also have some interplay with the herbivore's microbiome. Combined direct and indirect, microbe-mediated assaults by maize defenses on the fall armyworm on the insect digestive and immune system reduced growth and elevated mortality in these insects. These results imply that plant-insect interactions should be considered in the context of potential mediation by the insect  microbiome.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Deficiencies in the barrier are associated with various gastrointestinal and extra digestive disorders. Areas covered: This review provides an overview of the relationship between increased intestinal permeability and disease, and considers the role of mucosal protectants (mucoprotectants) in restoring normal intestinal barrier function, with a particular focus on diarrheal disorders. Expert commentary: Impairment of the intestinal barrier characterizes a variety of diseases, and there is ongoing interest in the development of pharmacological approaches targeting the reduction of intestinal permeability. These include corticosteroids, aminosalicylates and anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which act by reducing inflammation; probiotics, which modulate the production of mucin and epithelial tight junction proteins; and mucoprotectants, which form a protective film over the epithelium. Recently, preclinical and clinical data highlight, the ability of new mucoprotectants, such as gelatin tannate and xyloglucan, to protect the intestinal mucosa and to exert anti-diarrheal effects.

Information on 'healthy' or ''  in the public domain requires confirmation before endorsing dietary exclusions, replacement with non-irritating foods (such as fermented foods) or use of supplements to repair the damage. The intestinal barrier includes surface mucus, epithelial layer and immune defences. Epithelial permeability results from increased paracellular transport, apoptosis or transcellular permeability. Barrier function can be tested in vivo using orally administered probe molecules or in vitro using mucosal biopsies from humans, exposing the colonic mucosa from rats or mice or cell layers to extracts of colonic mucosa or stool from human patients. Assessment of intestinal barrier requires measurements beyond the epithelial layer. 'Stress' disorders such as endurance exercise, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs administration, pregnancy and surfactants (such as bile acids and dietary factors such as emulsifiers) increase permeability. Dietary factors can reverse intestinal leakiness and mucosal damage in the 'stress' disorders. Whereas inflammatory or ulcerating intestinal diseases result in  , no such disease can be cured by simply normalising intestinal barrier function. It is still unproven that restoring barrier function can ameliorate clinical manifestations in GI or systemic diseases. Clinicians should be aware of the potential of barrier dysfunction in GI diseases and of the barrier as a target for future therapy.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

It is well known that  mycotoxins will lead a breakdown of the normally impeccable epithelial barrier, resulting in the development of a "" .

The goal of this study is to investigate the roles of lactulose (LAC) and hydrogen-rich water (HRW) in preventing intestinal dysfunction in piglets fed  mycotoxin-contaminated feed.A total of 24 female piglets were evenly assigned to 4 groups: negative control (NC) group, mycotoxin-contaminated (MC) feed group, MC feed with LAC treatment (MC + LAC), and MC feed with HRW treatment (MC + HRW), respectively. Piglets in the NC group were fed uncontaminated control diet, while remaining piglets were fed  mycotoxin-contaminated diet. For the NC and MC groups, 10 mL/kg body weight (BW) of hydrogen-free water (HFW) was orally administrated to piglets twice daily; while in the MC + LAC and MC + HRW groups, piglets were treated with the same dose of LAC solution (500 mg/kg BW) and HRW twice daily, respectively. On d 25, serum was collected and used for biochemical analysis. Intestinal tissues were sampled for morphological examination as well as relative genes and protein expression analysis.Our data showed that  mycotoxins induced higher serum diamine oxidase (DAO) activities ( 0.05), -lactic acid levels ( 0.01), and endotoxin status ( 0.01), lower villus height ( 0.01) and ratio of villus height to crypt depth ( 0.05) in small intestine, greater apoptosis index and higher mRNA expression related to tight junctions ( 0.05). In addition, the distribution and down-regulation of claudin-3 (CLDN3) protein in the small intestinal was also observed. As expected, oral administrations of HRW and LAC were found to remarkably provide beneficial effects against  mycotoxin-induced apoptosis and intestinal leaking. Moreover, either HRW or LAC treatments were also revealed to prevent abnormal intestinal morphological changes, disintegrate tight junctions, and restore the expression and distribution of CLDN3 protein in the small intestinal mucosal layer in female piglets that were fed  mycotoxins contaminated diet.Our data suggest that orally administrations of HRW and LAC result in less  mycotoxin-induced apoptosis and leak in the small intestine.

Villus height and crypt depth were increased (p < .05) only in the ileum after fasting for 4.5 and 9 hr compared with non-fasting group. mRNA expression of claudin-3 was significantly reduced in the ileum of birds fasted for 9 and 19.5 hr, suggesting a role in IP modulation. However, all other TJP genes examined were not statistically different from control. Nevertheless, ileal FABP-6 of all fasted groups was significantly reduced, which could possibly be due to reduced bile acid production during fasting.© 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31019367>Phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate-Induced Changes in Chicken Enterocytes.</a></h1><p>Increased intestinal epithelial permeability has been linked to many enteric diseases because it allows easy access of microbial pathogens and toxins into the system. In poultry production, the restrictions in the use of antibiotic growth promoters have increased the chances of birds being susceptible to different enteric diseases. Thus, understanding the mechanisms which compromise intestinal function is pertinent. Based on our previous observation which showed the primary chicken enterocytes in culture undergoing dystrophic changes on treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), we surmised that this model, which appeared to mimic increased intestinal permeability, may help to understand the mechanisms of this problem. As genomic and proteomic changes are associated with many physiological and pathological problems, we were interested to find whether certain proteomic changes underlie the morphological alterations in the enterocytes induced by PMA. We exposed primary enterocyte cultures to a sub-lethal concentration of PMA, extracted the proteins, and analyzed by mass spectrometry for differentially regulated proteins. Our results showed that PMA affected several biological processes which negatively affected their energy metabolism, nuclear activities, and differentially regulated the levels of several stress proteins, chaperon, cytoskeletal, and signal transduction proteins that appear to be relevant in the cause of enterocyte dystrophy. Phorbol myristate acetate-affected signal transduction activities also raise the possibilities of their increased susceptibility to pathogens.

Results • Psychological stress typically triggers a fight-or-flight response, prompting corticotropin-releasing hormone and catecholamine production in various parts of the body, which ultimately disturbs the microbiota. In the absence of stress, a healthy microbiota produces short-chain fatty acids that exert anti-inflammatory and antitumor effects. During stress, an altered  microbial population affects the regulation of neurotransmitters mediated by the microbiome and  barrier function. Meditation helps regulate the stress response, thereby suppressing chronic inflammation states and maintaining a healthy -barrier function. Conclusions • The current research team recommends the integration of meditation into conventional health care and wellness models. Concurrently, studies to explore the effects of meditation on human microbiota are warranted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31327219>Parkinson's Disease: The Emerging Role of  Dysbiosis, Antibiotics, Probiotics, and Fecal Microbiota Transplantation.</a></h1><p>The role of the microbiome in health and human disease has emerged at the forefront of medicine in the 21st century. Over the last 2 decades evidence has emerged to suggest that inflammation-derived oxidative damage and cytokine induced toxicity may play a significant role in the neuronal damage associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines and T cell infiltration has been observed in the brain parenchyma of patients with PD. Furthermore, evidence for inflammatory changes has been reported in the enteric nervous system, the vagus nerve branches and glial cells. The presence of α-synuclein deposits in the post-mortem brain biopsy in patients with PD has further substantiated the role of inflammation in PD. It has been suggested that the α-synuclein misfolding might begin in the  and spread "prion like" via the vagus nerve into lower brainstem and ultimately to the midbrain; this is known as the Braak hypothesis. It is noteworthy that the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms (constipation, dysphagia, and hypersalivation), altered  microbiota and   have been observed in PD patients several years prior to the clinical onset of the disease. These clinical observations have been supported by in vitro studies in mice as well, demonstrating the role of genetic (α-synuclein overexpression) and environmental ( dysbiosis) factors in the pathogenesis of PD. The restoration of the  microbiome in patients with PD may alter the clinical progression of PD and this alteration can be accomplished by carefully designed studies using customized probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29485654> : liver : brain axis: the microbial challenge in the hepatic encephalopathy.</a></h1><p>Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a debilitating neuropsychiatric condition often associated with acute liver failure or cirrhosis. Advanced liver diseases are characterized by a   and systemic inflammation. There is strong evidence that the pathogenesis of HE is linked to a dysbiotic  microbiota and to harmful microbial by-products, such as ammonia, indoles, oxindoles and endotoxins. Increased concentrations of these toxic metabolites together with the inability of the diseased liver to clear such products is thought to play an important patho-ethiological role. Current first line clinical treatments target microbiota dysbiosis by decreasing the counts of pathogenic bacteria, blood endotoxemia and ammonia levels. This review will focus on the role of the  microbiota and its metabolism in HE and advanced cirrhosis. It will critically assess data from different clinical trials measuring the efficacy of the prebiotic lactulose, the probiotic VSL#3 and the antibiotic rifaximin in treating HE and advanced cirrhosis, through  microbiota modulation. Additionally data from Randomised Controlled Trials using pre-, pro- and synbiotic will be also considered by reporting meta-analysis studies. The large amount of existing data showed that HE is a clear example of how an altered  microbiota homeostasis can influence and impact on physiological functions outside the intestine, with implication for host health at the systems level. Nevertheless, a strong effort should be made to increase the information on  microbiota ecology and its metabolic function in liver diseases and HE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28676707>The  microbiome and liver cancer: mechanisms and clinical translation.</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of worldwide cancer mortality. HCC almost exclusively develops in patients with chronic liver disease, driven by a vicious cycle of liver injury, inflammation and regeneration that typically spans decades. Increasing evidence points towards a key role of the bacterial microbiome in promoting the progression of liver disease and the development of HCC. Here, we will review mechanisms by which the  microbiota promotes hepatocarcinogenesis, focusing on the  , bacterial dysbiosis, microbe-associated molecular patterns and bacterial metabolites as key pathways that drive cancer-promoting liver inflammation, fibrosis and genotoxicity. On the basis of accumulating evidence from preclinical studies, we propose the intestinal-microbiota-liver axis as a promising target for the simultaneous prevention of chronic liver disease progression and HCC development in patients with advanced liver disease. We will review in detail therapeutic modalities and discuss clinical settings in which targeting the -microbiota-liver axis for the prevention of disease progression and HCC development seems promising.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28410406>Lubiprostone improves intestinal permeability in humans, a novel therapy for the  : A prospective randomized pilot study in healthy volunteers.</a></h1><p>The barrier function of the small intestinal mucosa prevents the introduction of undesired pathogens into the body. Breakdown of this barrier function increases intestinal permeability. This has been proposed to induce not only gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, but also various other diseases, including allergies, diabetes mellitus, liver diseases, and collagen diseases, which are associated with this so called "  syndrome." As such, a method to prevent   syndrome would have substantial clinical value. However, no drugs have been demonstrated to improve disturbed intestinal permeability in humans to date. Therefore, we investigated whether a drug used to treat chronic constipation, lubiprostone, was effective for this purpose.Healthy male volunteers were treated with lubiprostone (24 μg/day) for 28 days. Intestinal permeability was evaluated by measuring the lactulose-mannitol ratio (LMR) after administration of diclofenac and compared with an untreated group. The examination was conducted three times in total, i.e., at baseline before diclofenac administration and after 14 and 28 days of lubiprostone treatment. Blood endotoxin activity was also evaluated at the same time points.The final analysis was conducted on 28 subjects (14 in the lubiprostone group and 14 in the untreated group). The LMR after 28 days of treatment was significantly lower in the lubiprostone group than that in the untreated group (0.017 vs. 0.028, respectively; 95% confidence interval, -0.022--0.0001; p = 0.049). Blood endotoxin activity exhibited almost no change over time in the lubiprostone and untreated groups and displayed no significant differences at any time point of examination.This study is the first to report an improvement in   using an available drug in humans. The result suggests that lubiprostone may prevent and ameliorate "  syndrome". However, a pivotal trial is needed to confirm our finding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30655633>Multidisciplinary approach to prostatitis.</a></h1><p>The modern clinical research on prostatitis started with the work of Stamey and coworkers who developed the basic principles we are still using. They established the segmented culture technique for localizing the infections in the males to the urethra, the bladder, or the prostate and to differentiate the main categories of prostatitis. Such categories with slight modifications are still used according to the NIH classification: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) and asymptomatic prostatitis. Prostatic inflammation is considered an important factor in influencing both prostatic growth and progression of symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. Chronic inflammation/neuroinflammation is a result of a deregulated acute phase response of the innate immune system affecting surrounding neural tissue at molecular, structural and functional levels. Clinical observations suggest that chronic inflammation correlates with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and an history of clinical chronic prostatitis significantly increases the odds for prostate cancer. The NIHNIDDK classification based on the use of the microbiological 4- glasses localization test or simplified 2-glasses test, is currently accepted worldwide. The UPOINT system identifies groups of clinicians with homogeneous clinical presentation and is used to recognize phenotypes to be submitted to specific treatments. The UPOINTS algorithm implemented the original UPOINT adding to the urinary domains (U), psycho-social (P), organspecific (O), infection (I), neurological (N), muscle tension and tenderness (T) a further domain related to sexuality (S). In fact sexual dysfunction (erectile, ejaculatory, libido loss) has been described in 46-92% of cases with a high impact on the quality of life of patients with CP/CPPS. Prostatic ultrasound represents the most popular imaging test in the work-up of either acute and chronic prostatitis although no specific hypo-hyperechoic pattern has been clearly associated with chronic bacterial prostatitis and CPPS. Use of a digital-processing software to calculate the extension of prostatic calcification area at ultrasound demonstrated a higher percentage of prostatic calcification in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis. Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) is the current state-of-the art imaging modality in the assessment of patients with prostate cancer although a variety of benign conditions, including inflammation, may mimic prostate cancer and act as confounding factors in the discrimination between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. Bacteria can infect prostate gland by: ascending the urethra, reflux of urine into the prostatic ducts, direct inoculation of bacteria through inserted biopsy needles or hematogenous seeding. Enterobacteriaceae are the predominant pathogens in acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis, but an increasing role of Enterococci has been reported. Many strains of these uropathogens exhibit the ability to form biofilm and multidrug- resistance. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) agents, in particular Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium, have been also considered as causative pathogens of chronic bacterial prostatitis. On the contrary the effective role in genital diseases of other "genital mycoplasmas" is still a much debated issue. Sexually Transmitted Infections agents should be investigated by molecular methods in both patient and sexual partner. "Next generation" investigations, such as cytokine analysis, cytological typing of immune cells could help stratifying the immune response. Epigenetic dysregulation of inflammatory factors should be investigated according to systemic and compartment-specific signals. The search for biomarkers should also include evaluation of hormonal pathways, as measurement of estrogen levels in semen. Antimicrobials are the first line agents for the treatment of bacterial prostatitis. The success of antimicrobial treatment depends on the antibacterial activity and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug which must reach high concentrations in prostate secretion and prostate tissue. Acute bacterial prostatitis can be a serious infection with a potential risk for urosepsis For iInitial treatment of severely ill patients, intravenous administration of high doses of bactericidal antimicrobials, such as broad-spectrum penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, is recommended in combination with an aminoglycoside. Use of piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem is justified in presence of multiresistant gramnegative pathogens. The antibiotic treatment of chronic prostatitis is currently based on the use of fluoroquinolones that, given for 2 to 4 weeks, cured about 70% of men with chronic bacterial prostatitis. For the treatment of Chlamydial prostatitis macrolides were shown to be more effective than fluoroquinolones, whereas no differences were observed in microbiological and clinical efficacy between macrolides and tetracyclines for the treatment of infections caused by intracellular pathogens. Aminoglycosides and fosfomycin could be considered as a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of quinolone resistant prostatitis. Use of alpha-blockers in CP/CPPS patients with urinary symptoms and analgesics +/- non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), in presence of pain demonstrated a reduction of symptoms reduction and an improvement of quality of life, although long term use of NSAID is limited by side effect profile. However, the multimodal therapeutic regimen by contemporary use of alphablockers, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory showed a better control of prostatitis symptoms than single drug treatment. Novel therapeutic substances for the treatment of pain, such as the cannabinoid anandamide would be highly interesting to test. An alternative for the treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is phytotherapy, as primary therapy or in association with other drugs. Quercetin, pollen extract, extract of Serenoa repens and other mixtures of herbal extracts showed a positive effect on symptoms and quality of life without side effects. The association of CP/CPPS with alterations of intestinal function has been described. Diet has its effects on inflammation by regulation of the composition of intestinal flora and direct action on the intestinal cells (sterile inflammation). Intestinal bacteria (microbiota) interacts with food influencing the metabolic, immune and inflammatory response of the organism. The intestinal microbiota has protective function against pathogenic bacteria, metabolic function by synthesis of vitamins, decomposition of bile acids and production of trophic factors (butyrate), and modulation of the intestinal immune system. The alteration of the microbiota is called "dysbiosis" causing invasive intestinal diseases pathologies (  syndrome and food intolerances, irritable bowel syndrome or chronic inflammatory bowel diseases) and correlating with numerous systemic diseases including acute and chronic prostatitis. Administration of live probiotics bacteria can be used to regulate the balance if intestinal flora. Sessions of hydrocolontherapy can represent an integration to this therapeutic approach. Finally, microbiological examination of sexual partners can offer supplementary information for treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27349436>The Role of the Microbial Metabolites Including Tryptophan Catabolites and Short Chain Fatty Acids in the Pathophysiology of Immune-Inflammatory and Neuroimmune Disease.</a></h1><p>There is a growing awareness that  commensal metabolites play a major role in host physiology and indeed the pathophysiology of several illnesses. The composition of the microbiota largely determines the levels of tryptophan in the systemic circulation and hence, indirectly, the levels of serotonin in the brain. Some microbiota synthesize neurotransmitters directly, e.g., gamma-amino butyric acid, while modulating the synthesis of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). The composition of the microbiota determines the levels and nature of tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs) which in turn has profound effects on aryl hydrocarbon receptors, thereby influencing epithelial barrier integrity and the presence of an inflammatory or tolerogenic environment in the intestine and beyond. The composition of the microbiota also determines the levels and ratios of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate and propionate. Butyrate is a key energy source for colonocytes. Dysbiosis leading to reduced levels of SCFAs, notably butyrate, therefore may have adverse effects on epithelial barrier integrity, energy homeostasis, and the T helper 17/regulatory/T cell balance. Moreover, dysbiosis leading to reduced butyrate levels may increase bacterial translocation into the systemic circulation. As examples, we describe the role of microbial metabolites in the pathophysiology of diabetes type 2 and autism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31364524>The menstrual cycle may not be limited to the endometrium but also may impact  permeability.</a></h1><p>To examine associations between IgA responses to Gram-negative -commensal bacteria and peri-menstrual symptoms and sex hormone levels during the menstrual cycle in women with and without premenstrual symptoms.Forty women aged 18-45 years completed the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) during all 28 consecutive days of the menstrual cycle. We assayed, in plasma, IgA responses to 6 Gram-negative bacteria, i.e. Hafnei alvei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas putida and Citrobacter pylori, progesterone and oestradiol at days 7, 14, 21 and 28 of the menstrual cycle.Significant changes in Δ (actual minus one week earlier) IgA to LPS of the 6 Gram-negative bacteria during the menstrual cycle were observed with peak IgA levels at T4 (day 28) and lows at T1 or T2 (day 7 or 14). The Δ IgA changes in H. alvei, M. Morganii, P. putida during the menstrual cycle were significantly and positively associated with changes in the total DRSP score, and severity of physio-somatic, anxiety and breast-craving, but not depressive, symptoms. The changes in IgA responses to LPS were largely predicted by changes in progesterone and steady-state levels of progesterone averaged over the luteal phase.Menstrual cycle-associated changes in IgA directed against LPS and by inference bacterial translocation may be driven by effects of progesterone on transcellular, paracellular and vascular pathways ( ) thereby contributing to the severity of physio-somatic and anxiety symptoms as well as fatigue, breast swelling and food cravings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30205543>The -Brain Axis in Alzheimer's Disease and Omega-3. A Critical Overview of Clinical Trials.</a></h1><p>Despite intensive study, neurodegenerative diseases remain insufficiently understood, precluding rational design of therapeutic interventions that can reverse or even arrest the progressive loss of neurological function. In the last decade, several theories investigating the causes of neurodegenerative diseases have been formulated and a condition or risk factor that can contribute is described by the -brain axis hypothesis: stress, unbalanced diet, and drugs impact altering microbiota composition which contributes to dysbiosis. An altered  microbiota may lead to a dysbiotic condition and to a subsequent increase in intestinal permeability, causing the so-called - syndrome. Herein, in this review we report recent findings in clinical trials on the risk factor of the -brain axis in Alzheimer's disease and on the effect of omega-3 supplementation, in shifting  microbiota balance towards an eubiosis status. Despite this promising effect, evidences reported in selected randomized clinical trials on the effect of omega-3 fatty acid on cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease are few. Only Mild Cognitive Impairment, a prodromal state that could precede the progress to Alzheimer's disease could be affected by omega-3 FA supplementation. We report some of the critical issues which emerged from these studies.

Healthy  microbiota comprises differing ratios of microoganisms wholly contributing to metabolic and other molecular reactions in a healthy, functioning body. After the demonstration of the bidirectional interaction between the central nervous system and  microbiota through neuroendocrine, neuroimmune, and autonomic nervous mechanisms, investigations have been started on the microbiota--brain axis in psychiatric disorders. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is a neurodevelopmental disorder of early childhood, is one of these disorders. Most of such studies were cross-sectional and mainly investigated the bacterial species. Changes in  microbiota composition and the   syndrome are some of the hypotheses proposed to explain the core symptoms and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms of ASD. Probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, diet have been proposed as treatment options. However, the role of microbiota in diagnosis, followup, and treatment is not yet clear. The bidirectional interaction between central nervous system and intestinal microbiota makes it difficult to establish the cause-effect relationship. The current data on microbiota may be useful to plan patient-specific treatment in autistic children with GI symptoms.

GI leakage with ATB, DSS, and DSS plus ATB (DSS+ATB) was demonstrated by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran translocation to the circulation. The administration of pathogenic bacteria, either  or  serovar Typhimurium, enhanced translocation. Bacteremia was demonstrated within 24 h in 50 to 88% of mice with GI leakage plus the administration of pathogenic bacteria but not with GI leakage induction alone or bacterial gavage alone.  bacteremia was found in only 16 to 29% and 0% of mice with  and  administrations, respectively.  bacteremia was demonstrated in 25 to 33% and 10 to 16% of mice with  and  administrations, respectively.  L34 attenuated GI leakage in these models, as shown by the reductions of FITC-dextran  translocation, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, bacteremia, and sepsis mortality. The reduction in the amount of fecal  bacteria with  treatment was demonstrated. In addition, an anti-inflammatory effect of the conditioned medium from  L34 was also demonstrated by the attenuation of cytokine production in colonic epithelial cells  In conclusion,  L34 attenuated the severity of symptoms in a murine sepsis model induced by GI leakage and the administration of pathogenic bacteria.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27604604>The -Brain Axis, Including the Microbiome,   and Bacterial Translocation: Mechanisms and Pathophysiological Role in Alzheimer's Disease.</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a progressive disorder manifested by gradual memory loss and subsequent impairment in mental and behavioral functions. Though the primary risk factor for AD is advancing age, other factors such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, obesity, vascular factors and depression play a role in its pathogenesis. The human gastrointestinal tract has a diverse commensal microbial population, which has bidirectional interactions with the human host that are symbiotic in health, and in addition to nutrition, digestion, plays major roles in inflammation and immunity. The most prevalent hypothesis for AD is the amyloid hypothesis, which states that changes in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein leads to the accumulation of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide. Aβ then triggers an immune response that drives neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in AD. The specific role of  microbiota in modulating neuro-immune functions well beyond the gastrointestinal tract may constitute an important influence on the process of neurodegeneration. We first review the main mechanisms involved in AD physiopathology. Then, we review the alterations in  microbiota and -brain axis that might be relevant to mediate or otherwise affect AD pathogenesis, especially those associated with aging. We finally summarize possible mechanisms that could mediate the involvement of -brain axis in AD physiopathology, and propose an integrative model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30120495>[Intestinal cross-talk : The  as motor of multiple organ failure].</a></h1><p>The central role of the organ system "" for critically ill patients has not been acknowledged until the last decade.

It focuses on the bidirectional signaling between the microbiota and the brain, here defined as the microbiota--vagus-heart-brain (MGVHB) axis and its systemic disruption accompanying altered neurodevelopment. Data derived from clinical and animal studies document increased prevalence of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms in both premature and autistic children and suggest an incomplete maturation of the -blood barrier resulting in a " ," dysbiosis, abnormalities in vagal regulation of the heart, altered development of specific brain regions, and behavior. Furthermore, this review posits the hypothesis that common genetic variants link the abnormalities in the MGVHB axis in premature and autistic pathologies. This hypothesis is based on the recently identified common genetic variants: early B cell factor 1 (EBF1), selenocysteine tRNA-specific eukaryotic elongation factor (EEFSEC), and angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AGTR2), in the maternal and infant DNA samples, associated with risk of preterm birth and independently implicated in a risk of autism. We predict that the AGTR2 variants involved in the brain maturation and oxytocin-arginine-vasopressin (OXT-AVP) pathways, related to social behavior, will contribute to our understanding of the link between prematurity and autism paving a way to new therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29708627>Effect of humic acids on intestinal viscosity,   and ammonia excretion in a 24 hr feed restriction model to induce intestinal permeability in broiler chickens.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of humic acids (HA) on intestinal viscosity,   and ammonia excretion in a 24 hr feed restriction (FR) model to induce intestinal permeability in chickens.

Experiments were conducted in broiler chickens to evaluate supplementation of L-glutamine, glycine, and L-arginine in a reduced protein (RP) diet. Experiment 1 examined the growth performance of broilers fed 5 dietary treatments: 1) a standard diet; 2) an RP diet (193.9 g/kg CP in grower and 176.9 g/kg CP in finisher); 3) RP diet supplemented with 10 g/kg L-Gln; 4) RP diet supplemented with 10 g/kg Gly; 5) RP diet supplemented with 5 g/kg L-Arg. Each experimental diet was replicated 6 times with 10 birds per replicate. In a subset of 96 birds, experiment 2 tested the 4 RP diets with and without dexamethasone (DEX) to induce  . Each diet was replicated 24 times. Fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) was used to test intestinal permeability (IP). Gene expression of selected tight junction proteins in ileal and jejunal tissues was assayed by quantitative PCR. From day 7 to 35, the RP diet increased feed intake (FI) (P < 0.05) and body weight gain (BWG) compared with the standard diet while Gln reduced FI and BWG (P < 0.05) compared with RP. Gly had no effect on BWG or FCR. Supplementation of Arg improved FCR from day 21 to 35 and day 7 to 35. In experiment 2, Arg tended to lower FITC-d (P = 0.086). DEX increased passage of FITC-d into the serum (P < 0.001). The villi surface area was increased in birds fed higher Arg (P < 0.05). DEX and diet interacted (P < 0.01) for jejunal claudin-3 mRNA level where DEX upregulated claudin-3 for all diets except the Arg diet. In summary, with a moderate reduction of protein, satisfactory performance can be obtained. Although Gln and Gly had no demonstrable positive effect on IP and performance of broilers, increasing the dietary Arg by approximately 140% improved FCR and showed indications of improved intestinal barrier function of birds fed an RP diet under a stress model.© The Author(s) 2019.

In this study, we aimed to clarify the mechanism by which  microbiota and SCFAs can treat cerebral ischemic stroke in rat middle cerebral artery occlusion models and use the information to develop new therapies. Our results show that oral administration of non-absorbable antibiotics reduced neurological impairment and the cerebral infarct volume, relieved cerebral edemas, and decreased blood lipid levels by altering the  microbiota. We also found that ischemic stroke decreased intestinal levels of SCFAs. And that transplanting fecal microbiota rich in these metabolites was an effective means of treating the condition. Compared with other SCFAs, butyric acid showed the highest negative correlation with ischemic stroke. Supplementation with butyric acid treated models of ischemic stroke effectively by remodeling the  microbiota, enriching the beneficial Lactobacillus, and repairing the  . In conclusion, interfering with the  microbiota by transplanting fecal bacteria rich in SCFAs and supplementing with butyric acid were found to be effective treatments for cerebral ischemic stroke.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Their composition follows a natural annual rhythm, as apparent by hibernating animals and humans living close to nature. Life shaped by "western industrialization", including microbiome shocks such as antibiotics, low-fiber and low-bacteria diets combined with the consumption of industrialized food leads to the loss of bacterial species in the body. This induces deficiency symptoms, diseases and results in lower energy yields from food. It might also result in the loss of intestinal mucous and " ".

So far the traditionally prescribed prebiotics and probiotics do not show significant impact on amelioration of these diseases in general. Thus the development of next generation prebiotics and probiotics designed to target specific diseases is urgently needed. In this review, we first make a brief introduction on current understandings of normal  microbiota, microbiome, and their roles in homeostasis of mucosal immunity and  integrity. Then, under the situation of microbiota dysbiosis, development of chronic inflammations in the intestine occurs, leading to   situation and systematic chronic inflammation in the host. These subsequently resulted in development of many important diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, liver inflammations, and other diseases such as colorectal cancer (CRC), obesity-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD), the compromised lung immunity, and some on brain/neuro disorders. The strategy used to optimally implant the effective prebiotics, probiotics and the derived postbiotics for amelioration of the diseases is presented. While the effectiveness of these agents seems promising, additional studies are needed to establish recommendations for most clinical settings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28738753>Genetic predictors of celiac disease, lactose intolerance, and vitamin D function and presence of peptide morphins in urine of children with neurodevelopmental disorders.</a></h1><p>Gastrointestinal disturbances, nutritional deficiencies, and food intolerances are frequently observed in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). To reveal possible association of celiac disease risk variants (HLA-DQ), lactose intolerance associated variant (LCT-13910C>T) as well as variant associated with vitamin D function (VDR FokI) with NDD, polymerase chain reaction-based methodology was used. Additionally, intestinal peptide permeability was estimated in NDD patients and healthy children by measuring the level of peptides in urine using high-performance liquid chromatography. Levels of opioid peptides, casomorphin 8, and gluten exorphin C were significantly elevated in urine samples of NDD patients (P = 0.004 and P = 0.005, respectively), but no association of genetic risk variants for celiac disease and lactose intolerance with NDD was found. Our results indicate that increased intestinal peptide permeability observed in analyzed NDD patients is not associated with genetic predictors of celiac disease or lactose intolerance.

HE largely contributes to the morbidity of patients with liver disease, severely affecting the quality of life of both patients and their relatives and being associated with poor prognosis. Its presentation is largely variable, manifesting with a broad spectrum of cognitive abnormalities ranging from subtle cognitive impairment to coma. The pathogenesis of HE is complex and has historically been linked with hyperammonemia. However, in the last years, it has become evident that the interplay of multiple actors, such as intestinal dysbiosis,  hyperpermeability, and neuroinflammation, is of crucial importance in its genesis. Therefore, HE can be considered a result of a dysregulated -liver-brain axis function, where cognitive impairment can be reversed or prevented by the beneficial effects induced by "-centric" therapies, such as non-absorbable disaccharides, non-absorbable antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation. In this context dietary modifications, by modulating the intestinal milieu, can also provide significant benefit to cirrhotic patients with HE. This review will provide a comprehensive insight into the mechanisms responsible for -liver-brain axis dysregulation leading to HE in cirrhosis. Furthermore, it will explore the currently available therapies and the most promising future treatments for the management of patients with HE, with a special focus on the dietary approach.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27741171> Microbiota and the Liver: A Tale of 2 Cities: A Narrative View in 2 Acts.</a></h1><p>Microbes are mostly important for the digestion of food, the absorption of some micronutrients, and the production of vitamins. The microbiota stimulates lymphoid structures in the gastrointestinal mucosa and decrease pathogens by competing for nutrients and space. Bacterial translocation is defined as the escape of  bacteria and their products through the intestinal mucosa to the outside of the intestine as portovenous or systemic circulation. This is induced by a   barrier. There is evidence for a role of intestinal permeability in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In the liver, bacterial products can bind to their specific pathogen recognition receptors on parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells, producing an inflammatory response and enhancing disease progression. When binding, bacterial products bind to their receptors, initiating intracellular signalling and inducing an inflammatory cascade, thus accelerating liver cell damage and fibrosis. However, the liver can also increase  permeability, producing proinflammatory cytokines, and reversing them into the blood stream. Modification of the  microbiota could lead to benefit in patients with liver disease. Nonabsorbable antibiotics (rifaximin) prevent and relieve overt encephalopathy. Probiotics alone are not capable of turning back overt encephalopathy, but could prevent its development. There is some evidence that probiotics could relent the progression of nonalcoholic liver disease, and possibly reverse steatosis. Antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones, reduce the risk of development of the first episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and mortality in cirrhotic patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29097439>Mucosa-associated invariant T cells link intestinal immunity with antibacterial immune defects in alcoholic liver disease.</a></h1><p>Intestinal permeability with systemic distribution of bacterial products are central in the immunopathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD), yet links with intestinal immunity remain elusive. Mucosa-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) are found in liver, blood and intestinal mucosa and are a key component of antibacterial host defences. Their role in ALD is unknown.We analysed frequency, phenotype, transcriptional regulation and function of blood MAIT cells in severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH), alcohol-related cirrhosis (ARC) and healthy controls (HC). We also examined direct impact of ethanol, bacterial products from faecal extracts and antigenic hyperstimulation on MAIT cell functionality. Presence of MAIT cells in colon and liver was assessed by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry/gene expression respectively.In ARC and SAH, blood MAIT cells were dramatically depleted, hyperactivated and displayed defective antibacterial cytokine/cytotoxic responses. These correlated with suppression of lineage-specific transcription factors and hyperexpression of homing receptors in the liver with intrahepatic preservation of MAIT cells in ALD. These alterations were stronger in SAH, where surrogate markers of bacterial infection and microbial translocation were higher than ARC. Ethanol exposure in vitro, in vivo alcohol withdrawal and treatment with  had no effect on MAIT cell frequencies, whereas exposure to faecal bacteria/antigens induced functional impairments comparable with blood MAIT cells from ALD and significant MAIT cell depletion, which was not observed in other T cell compartments.In ALD, the antibacterial potency of MAIT cells is compromised as a consequence of contact with microbial products and microbiota, suggesting that the ''  observed in ALD drives MAIT cell dysfunction and susceptibility to infection in these patients.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

The precursor of Hp-2 is zonulin, a molecule that affects intercellular tight junction integrity. Recently, we reported increased plasma IgA/IgM responses to Gram-negative bacteria in deficit schizophrenia indicating   and  dysbiosis. The current study was performed to examine the integrity of the paracellular (tight and adherens junctions) and transcellular (cytoskeletal proteins) pathways in deficit versus non-deficit schizophrenia. We measured IgM responses to zonulin, occludin, E-cadherin, talin, actin, and vinculin in association with IgA responses to Gram-negative bacteria, CCL-11, IgA responses to tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), immune activation and IgM to malondialdehyde (MDA), and NO-cysteinyl in 78 schizophrenia patients and 40 controls. We found that the ratio of IgM to zonulin + occludin/talin + actin + viculin (PARA/TRANS) was significantly greater in deficit than those in non-deficit schizophrenia and higher in schizophrenia than those in controls and was significantly associated with increased IgA responses to Gram-negative bacteria. IgM responses to zonulin were positively associated with schizophrenia (versus controls), while IgM to occludin was significantly associated with deficit schizophrenia (versus non-deficit schizophrenia and controls). A large part of the variance (90.8%) in negative and PHEM (psychosis, hostility, excitation, and mannerism) symptoms was explained by PARA/TRANS ratio, IgA to Gram-negative bacteria, IgM to E-cadherin and MDA, and memory dysfunctions, while 53.3% of the variance in the latter was explained by PARA/TRANS ratio, IgA to Gram-negative bacteria, CCL-11, TRYCATs, and immune activation. The results show an upregulated paracellular pathway with breakdown of the tight and adherens junctions and increased bacterial translocation in deficit schizophrenia. These dysfunctions in the intestinal paracellular route together with lowered natural IgM, immune activation, and production of CCL-11 and TRYCATs contribute to the phenomenology of deficit schizophrenia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29705843>Neuroimmune Imbalances and Yin-Yang Dynamics in Stress, Anxiety, and Depression.</a></h1><p>Evidences from psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) and systems biology studies support a conceptual framework of "Yin-Yang dynamics" for understanding the "whole mind-body system." The Yin-Yang dynamical balances in the stress response networks may be critical for health and diseases, especially mental health and psychiatric disorders. Specifically, the neuroimmune imbalances have been found as the important features and potential biomarkers of stress, anxiety, depression, and systemic inflammation. At the system levels, factors such as psychosocial stress and obesity, especially a  , may result in the imbalance between regulatory and proinflammatory T cells. At the molecular and cellular levels, the imbalances in multiple networks including the cytokine and redox pathways, immune-kynurenine networks, HPA axis, and synaptic plasticity in the hypothalamus are the key factors in depression.

The mean Mini Mental State Examination score was 18.5 ± 7.7. Biomarkers of immune activation - serum neopterin and tryptophan breakdown - as well as  inflammation markers and microbiota composition in fecal specimens were analyzed in 18 patients before and after probiotic supplementation for 4 weeks.After treatment a decline of fecal zonulin concentrations and an increase in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii compared to baseline were observed. At the same time, serum kynurenine concentrations increased (p <0.05). Delta values (before - after) of neopterin and the kynurenine to tryptophan ratios (Kyn/Trp) correlated significantly (p <0.05).Results show that the supplementation of Alzheimer's disease patients with a multispecies probiotic influences  bacteria composition as well as tryptophan metabolism in serum. The correlation between Kyn/Trp and neopterin concentrations points to the activation of macrophages and/or dendritic cells.

IP has been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis and exacerbation of many chronic diseases. Many potential risk factors for IP are proposed in contemporary literature. The purpose of this review is to identify the most significant risk factors for IP.A systematic search of literature published up until September 2018 in the PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Scopus databases was conducted.A total of 47 articles met the inclusion criteria. Elevated levels of proinflammatory markers, dyslipidaemia, hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, anthropometric measurements resembling obesity, advanced disease severity, comorbidity and the consumption of a Western-style diet were identified as the strongest risk factors for altered intestinal integrity. The risk of IP increases when coupled with a multiple disease state or combined with other environmental risk factors. Furthermore, many of the identified risk factors such as anthropometric measurements and biomarkers were external from intestinal health and rather resembled a metabolic-like condition.This review identified a number of potential risk factors for IP, ranging from biomarkers to anthropometric measurements, demographics, dietary intake and chronic diseases. These risk factors warrant the attention of clinicians and other healthcare providers to aid the identification of potential patients at risk of altered IP. Further research needs to examine whether the identified risk factors are homogeneous with the diagnosis of IP or whether the disease state influences the association.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30925795>The Transformative Possibilities of the Microbiota and Mycobiota for Health, Disease, Aging, and Technological Innovation.</a></h1><p>The  microbiota is extremely important for the health of the host across its lifespan.Recent studies have elucidated connections between the  microbiota and neurological diseaseand disorders such as depression, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease (AD), autism, and a host of otherbrain illnesses.

Poorly bioavailable and only partially metabolizable dietary polyphenols, such as proanthocyanidins (PACs), may exert their beneficial effects on metabolic health by scavenging intestinal ROS. To test this hypothesis, we developed and validated a novel, noninvasive, in situ method for visualizing intestinal ROS using orally administered ROS-sensitive indocyanine green (ICG) dye. C57BL/6J mice fed HFD for 10 weeks accumulated high levels of intestinal ROS compared to mice fed low-fat diet (LFD). Oral administration of poorly bioavailable grape polyphenol extract (GPE) and β-carotene decreased HFD-induced ROS in the  to levels comparable to LFD-fed mice, while administration of more bioavailable dietary antioxidants (α-lipoic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E) did not. Forty percent of administered GPE antioxidant activity was measured in feces collected over 24 h, confirming poor bioavailability and persistence in the . The bloom of beneficial anaerobic  bacteria, such as Akkermansia muciniphila, associated with improved metabolic status in rodents and humans may be directly linked to protective antioxidant activity of some dietary components.

Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli are isolated most frequently from human stool samples, but severe infections by C. fetus (Cf), which can cause gastroenteritis, septicemia, and abortion, are also found. This study aims at the characterization of pathological changes in Cf infection using an intestinal epithelial cell model. The Cf-induced epithelial barrier defects appeared earlier than those of avian Campylobacter species like C. jejuni/C. coli. Two-path impedance spectroscopy (2PI) distinguished transcellular and paracellular resistance contributions to the overall epithelial barrier impairment. Both transcellular and paracellular resistance of Cf-infected HT-29/B6 monolayers were reduced. The latter was attributed to activation of active anion secretion. Western blot analysis showed no decrease in tight junction (TJ) protein expression (claudin-1, -2, -3, and -4) but showed redistribution of claudin-1 off the TJ domain. In addition, Cf induced epithelial cell death, cell detachment, and lesions (focal leaks), as the result of which macromolecule flux (10-kDa dextran) was increased in Cf-invaded cell monolayers. In conclusion, barrier dysfunction from Cf infection was due to TJ protein redistribution, cell death induction, and leak formation, resulting in bacterial translocation, ion leak flux, and antigen uptake ( ).© 2017 New York Academy of Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31490117>Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Systemic Hypertension:  Dysbiosis as the Mediator?</a></h1><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and systemic hypertension (SH) are common and interrelated diseases.

In ulcerative colitis, diarrhea and antigen entry into the mucosa occurs. Claudin-2 is upregulated but data on other claudins are still limited or vary (e.g., claudin-1 and -4). Apart from that, tight junction changes contribute to diarrhea via a leak flux mechanism, while protection against antigen entry disappears behind epithelial gross lesions (erosions) and apoptotic foci. Crohn's disease is additionally characterized by a claudin-5 and claudin-8 reduction which plays an active role in antigen uptake already before gross lesions appear. In microscopic colitis (MC), upregulation of claudin-2 expression is weak and a reduction in claudin-4 may be only passively involved, while sodium malabsorption represents the main diarrheal mechanism. However, claudin-5 is removed from MC tight junctions which may be an active trigger for inflammation through antigen uptake along the so-called   concept. In celiac disease, primary barrier defects are discussed in the context of candidate genes as PARD3 which regulate cell polarity and tight junctions. The loss of claudin-5 allows small antigens to invade, while the reductions in others like claudin-3 are rather passive events. Taken together, the specific role of single tight junction proteins for the onset and perpetuation of inflammation and the recovery from these diseases is far from being fully understood and is clearly dependent on the stage of the disease, the background of the other tight junction components, the transport activity of the mucosa, and the presence of other barrier features like gross lesions, an orchestral interplay which is discussed in this article.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30081517>Retinoic Acid,  , and Autoimmune Diseases.</a></h1><p>A   has been observed in a number of autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

However, a real relationship between these entities is unclear due to a lack of scientific validity. We conducted an extensive review of the literature using two different search strategies. A narrower strategy included 88 searches of various combinations of terms for each of the three conditions, yielding 19 unique papers. A broader search included 136 searches of various combinations of terms but included all forms of EDS and yielded 40 unique papers. Of these, only four and nine papers from the narrower and broader search strategies were original research articles. None of these papers resulted from a combination of the search terms for the three conditions. All three clinical entities are controversial in either existence or pathogenesis. MCAS is a poorly defined clinical entity, and many studies do not adhere to the proposed criteria when establishing the diagnosis. Patients previously diagnosed with EDS hypermobility type may not meet the new, stricter criteria for hEDS but may for a less severe hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD). The pathophysiology of POTS is still unclear. An evidence-based, common pathophysiologic mechanism between any of the two, much less all three conditions, has yet to be described. Our review of the literature shows that current evidence is lacking on the existence of MCAS or hEDS as separate or significant clinical entities. Studies proposing a relationship between the three clinical entities are either biased or based on outdated criteria. The reason behind the purported association of these entities stems from an overlapping pool of vague, subjective symptoms, which is inadequate evidence to conclude that any such relationship exists.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31289225>Autoimmune diabetes mellitus and the  .</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28400259>A role for the peripheral immune system in the development of alcohol use disorders?</a></h1><p>Preclinical studies have largely supported that alcohol-consumption induces the development of an important neuro-inflammation and this neuro-inflammation contributes to alcohol-drinking behaviors, notably through TLR4 and LPS related mechanisms.

The intestinal barrier is sensitive to HS and heat-induced hyperpermeability plays a key role in its pathophysiology. However, the biology of recovery following HS is less understood. Thus, study objectives were to determine the temporal pattern of metabolic, inflammatory, and intestinal histological parameters during HS recovery. Female pigs (n = 32; 19.5 ± 0.5 kg BW) were sacrificed following exposure to 1 of 4 environmental treatments: 1) constant thermoneutral (TN) conditions (TNC; 24.2 ± 0.5°C), 2) no TN recovery post HS (0D), 3) 3 d of TN recovery post HS (3D), and 4) 7 d of TN recovery post HS (7D). The HS protocol was cyclical (33.6 ± 1.8 to 37.4 ± 2.1°C) and lasted for 3 d for all HS treatments. During the 3 d of HS, rectal temperature, skin temperature, and respiration rates were increased (1.3°C, 4.8°C, and 77 breaths/min, respectively; P < 0.01) and ADFI was decreased (27%; P < 0.01) compared to TNC pigs. Skin temperature tended to be decreased 0.6°C in 3D pigs during days 1-3 of recovery (P = 0.06) and was decreased 1.6 and 0.7°C during days 1-3 and 4-7 of recovery, respectively, in 7D pigs (P ≤ 0.03) compared to TNC. Relative to TNC pigs, ADFI remained 14% decreased during days 1-3 of recovery in both 3D and 7D pigs, and 17% decreased during days 4-7 in 7D pigs (P ≤ 0.01). Plasma glucose was decreased (10%; P = 0.03) for 0D and 3D relative to TNC pigs. Circulating lipopolysaccharide-binding protein was increased in 3D and 7D vs. TNC pigs (110 and 147%, respectively; P = 0.01) and tended to increase linearly with increasing recovery time (P = 0.08). Circulating tumor necrosis factor alpha was decreased (15%) in 0D pigs and increased linearly with advancing recovery time (P < 0.01). Jejunum and ileum villus height were reduced 17 and 11% in 0D vs. TNC pigs and increased linearly with progressive recovery time (P < 0.01). Jejunum and ileum mucosal surface areas were reduced 17 and 9% in 0D pigs and remained decreased in the jejunum while the ileum recovered to TNC levels by day 3 of recovery. Relative to TNC pigs, goblet cell area was similar in jejunum and colon of 0D pigs but was reduced in the ileum of 0D pigs and in jejunum, ileum, and colon of 3D and 7D relative to TNC pigs (P < 0.01).

Cholangiocytes themselves activate innate immune responses against -derived microorganisms or bacterial products that reach the liver via enterohepatic circulation.  microbiota has been implicated in the development and progression of the two most common cholangiopathies, i.e., primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), which have distinctive microbiota composition compared to healthy individuals. The impairment of intestinal barrier functions or  dysbiosis expose cholangiocytes to an increasing amount of microorganisms and may exacerbate inflammatory responses thus leading to fibrotic remodeling of the organ. The present review focuses on the complex interactions between the activation of innate immune responses in reactive cholangiocytes, dysbiosis, and  permeability to bacterial products in the pathogenesis of PSC and PBC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28280004>Connexin-purinergic signaling in enteric glia mediates the prolonged effect of morphine on constipation.</a></h1><p>Morphine is one of the most widely used drugs for the treatment of pain. However, side effects, including persistent constipation and antinociceptive tolerance, limit its clinical efficacy. Prolonged morphine treatment results in a "" , predisposing to colonic inflammation that is facilitated by microbial dysbiosis and associated bacterial translocation. In this study, we examined the role of enteric glia in mediating this secondary inflammatory response to prolonged treatment with morphine. We found that purinergic P2X receptor activity was significantly enhanced in enteric glia that were isolated from mice with long-term morphine treatment () but not upon direct exposure of glia to morphine (). LPS, a major bacterial product, also increased ATP-induced currents, as well as expression of P2X4, P2X7, IL6, IL-1β mRNA in enteric glia. LPS increased connexin43 (Cx43) expression and enhanced ATP release from enteric glia cells. LPS-induced P2X currents and proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression were blocked by the Cx43 blockers Gap26 and carbenoxolone. Likewise, colonic inflammation related to prolonged exposure to morphine was significantly attenuated by carbenoxolone (25 mg/kg). Carbenoxolone also prevented  wall disruption and significantly reduced morphine-induced constipation. These findings imply that enteric glia activation is a significant modulator of morphine-related inflammation and constipation.-Bhave, S., Gade, A., Kang, M., Hauser, K. F., Dewey, W.

However, an understanding of the physiological mechanism of HS lactating dairy cows remains elusive. Here, a metabolomics study using LC-MS and (1)H NMR spectroscopy was performed to analyze the metabolomic differences in the milk between HS-free and HS dairy cows, and discover diagnostic biomarkers and changes in the metabolic pathway. A total of 53 discriminating metabolites were significantly up- or down-regulated in the HS group compared with the HS-free group (P < 0.05). These biomarkers were involved in pathways of carbohydrate, amino acid, lipid, and  microbiome-derived metabolism. Comparing these potential biomarkers with previously identified HS candidate biomarkers in plasma, significant correlations between the levels of lactate, pyruvate, creatine, acetone, β-hydroxybutyrate, trimethylamine, oleic acid, linoleic acid, lysophosphatidylcholine 16:0, and phosphatidylcholine 42:2 in milk and plasma were found, indicating that the blood-milk barrier became  and the levels of these 10 biomarkers in milk can reflect HS-induced metabolomic alterations in blood.

Deficit schizophrenia is characterized by an immune-inflammatory response combined with a deficit in natural IgM antibodies to oxidative-specific epitopes (OSEs), which are a first-line defense against bacterial infections. This study measured plasma IgA/IgM responses to 5 Gram-negative bacteria in association with IgM responses to malondialdehyde (MDA) and azelaic acid in 80 schizophrenia patients (40 with the deficit syndrome and 40 without) and in 38 healthy controls. Deficit schizophrenia was characterized by significantly increased IgA responses to Hafnei alvei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae as compared with non-deficit schizophrenia. The presence of deficit schizophrenia was highly predicted by increased IgA responses to Pseudomonas putida and IgM responses to all five Gram-negative bacteria and lowered natural IgM to MDA and azelaic acid with a bootstrap area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.960 (2000 random curves). A large proportion of the variance (41.5%) in the negative subscale score of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale was explained by the regression on IgA responses to K. pneumoniae and IgM responses to the five enterobacteria coupled with lowered IgM antibodies to azelaic acid. There were significant associations between IgA levels to Gram-negative bacteria and Mini-Mental State Examination, Boston naming test, Verbal Fluency, and Word List Memory test scores. These findings provide further evidence that deficit schizophrenia is a distinct phenotype of schizophrenia, which is characterized by an increased impact of Gram-negative commensal bacteria coupled with a deficit in natural IgM, pointing to aberrations in B1 cells. It is concluded that increased bacterial translocation and deficits in the compensatory immune-regulatory system (CIRS) may drive negative symptoms and neurocognitive impairments, which are hallmarks of deficit schizophrenia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29368445>Lactobacillus reuteri strains protect epithelial barrier integrity of IPEC-J2 monolayers from the detrimental effect of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.</a></h1><p>Lactobacillus reuteri is an inhabitant of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of mammals and birds and several strains of this species are known to be effective probiotics. The mechanisms by which L. reuteri confers its health-promoting effects are far from being fully understood, but protection of the mucosal barrier is thought to be important.   is a state of abnormal intestinal permeability with implications for the pathophysiology of various gastrointestinal disorders. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) can invade the intestinal mucosa and induce changes in barrier function by producing enterotoxin or by direct invasion of the intestinal epithelium. Our hypothesis was that L. reuteri can protect the mucosal barrier, and the goal of the study was to challenge this hypothesis by monitoring the protective effect of L. reuteri strains on epithelial dysfunction caused by ETEC. Using an infection model based on the porcine intestinal cell line IPEC-J2, it was demonstrated that pretreatment of the cells with human-derived L. reuteri strains (ATCC PTA 6475, DSM 17938 and 1563F) and a rat strain (R2LC) reduced the detrimental effect of ETEC in a dose-dependent manner, as monitored by permeability of FITC-dextran and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Moreover, the results revealed that ETEC upregulated proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα and decreased expression of the shorter isoform of ZO-1 (187 kDa) and E-cadherin. In contrast, pretreatment with L. reuteri DSM 17938 and 1563F downregulated expression of IL-6 and TNFα, and led to an increase in production of the longer isoform of ZO-1 (195 kDa) and maintained E-cadherin expression. Interestingly, expression of ZO-1 (187 kDa) was preserved only when the infected cells were pretreated with strain 1563F. These findings demonstrate that L. reuteri strains exert a protective effect against ETEC-induced mucosal integrity disruption.© 2018 The Authors.

Shared pathways in both MetS and mood disorders are low grade inflammation, including increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins, increased lipid peroxidation with formation of malondialdehyde and oxidized low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), hypernitrosylation, lowered levels of antioxidants, most importantly zinc and paraoxonase (PON1), increased bacterial translocation ( ), increased atherogenic index of plasma and Castelli risk indices; and reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL-c) cholesterol. Insulin resistance is probably not a major factor associated with mood disorders. Given the high levels of IO&NS and metabolic dysregulation in BD and MDD and the high comorbidity with the atherogenic components of the MetS, mood disorders should be viewed as systemic neuro-IO&NS-metabolic disorders. The IO&NS-metabolic biomarkers may have prognostic value and may contribute to the development of novel treatments targeting neuro-immune, neuro-oxidative and neuro-nitrosative pathways.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

End of term serum IgM responses to OSEs and NO-adducts were assayed in pregnant women with (n = 24) and without prenatal depression (n = 25) as well as in 24 non-pregnant women. Associations of IgM/IgA responses to Gram-negative  commensal bacteria (  index) and IgA/IgM responses to tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs) were analyzed. IgM responses to OSEs, but not NO-adducts, were significantly reduced at the end of term. There were no significant associations between IgM responses to OSEs and perinatal depression, whilst IgM responses to NO-adducts, especially NO-cysteinyl, were significantly associated with a lifetime major depression. IgM responses to OSEs and NO-cysteinyl were significantly associated with IgA/IgM responses to Gram-negative bacteria, especially Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter koseri. IgM responses to NO-adducts and OSEs, especially malondialdehyde and myristic acid, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were inversely associated with TRYCAT pathway activity, whilst a lifetime depression and Pseudomonas putida were positively associated. The attenuation of natural IgM-mediated responses to OSEs at the end of term may indicate lowered activity of this part of the compensatory (anti-)inflammatory reflex system and may be partly explained by lowered bacterial translocation. Increased IgM responses to NO-cysteinyl is a biomarker of lifetime depression and may be induced by bacterial translocation. Natural IgM-mediated autoimmune responses, increased nitrosylation and higher CRP levels may have negative regulatory effects on the TRYCAT pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30471416>Deciphering microbiome and neuroactive immune gene interactions in schizophrenia.</a></h1><p>The body's microbiome represents an actively regulated network of novel mechanisms that potentially underlie the etiology and pathophysiology of a wide range of diseases. For complex brain disorders such as schizophrenia, understanding the cellular and molecular pathways that intersect the bidirectional -brain axis is anticipated to lead to new methods of treatment. The means by which the microbiome might differ across neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders are not known. Brain disorders as diverse as schizophrenia, major depression, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis appear to share a common pathology of an imbalanced community of commensal microbiota, often measured in terms of a   phenotype accompanied by low level systemic inflammation. While environmental factors associated with these disease states might contribute to intestinal pathologies, products from a perturbed microbiome may also directly promote specific signs, symptoms and etiologies of individual disorders. We hypothesize that in schizophrenia, it is the putatively unique susceptibility related to genes that modulate the immune system and the -brain pleiotropy of these genes which leads to a particularly neuropathological response when challenged by a microbiome in dysbiosis. Consequences from exposure to this dysbiosis may occur during pre- or post-natal time periods and thus may interfere with normal neurodevelopment in those who are genetically predisposed. Here, we review the evidence from the literature which supports the idea that the intersection of the microbiome and immune gene susceptibility in schizophrenia is relevant etiologically and for disease progression. Figuring prominently at both ends of the -brain axis and at points in between are proteins encoded by genes found in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), including select MHC as well as non-MHC complement pathway genes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Emerging evidence suggests that modifying the composition of the  microbiota via probiotic supplementation may be a viable adjuvant treatment option for individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). Convergent evidence indicates that persistent low-grade inflammatory activation is associated with the diagnosis of MDD as well as the severity of depressive symptoms and probability of treatment response. The objectives of this review are to (1) evaluate the evidence supporting an anti-inflammatory effect of probiotics and (2) describe immune system modulation as a potential mechanism for the therapeutic effects of probiotics in populations with MDD. A narrative review of studies investigating the effects of probiotics on systemic inflammation was conducted. Studies were identified using PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov (from inception to November 2017) using the following search terms (and/or variants): probiotic, inflammation,  microbiota, and depression. The available evidence suggests that probiotics should be considered a promising adjuvant treatment to reduce the inflammatory activation commonly found in MDD. Several controversial points remain to be addressed including the role of  , the role of stress exposure, and the role of blood-brain-barrier permeability. Taken together, the results of this review suggest that probiotics may be a potentially beneficial, but insufficiently studied, antidepressant treatment intervention.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Crossbred gilts (n = 50; 50 ± 2 kg BW) were blocked by initial BW and randomly assigned to one of five treatments: 1) thermoneutral (TN) and ad libitum fed a control diet (TNCtl), 2) TN and pair-fed a control diet (PFCtl), 3) TN and pair-fed a Zn-supplemented diet (PFZn), 4) HS and ad libitum fed a control diet (HSCtl), and 5) HS and ad libitum fed a Zn-supplemented diet (HSZn). The study consisted of 3 experimental periods (P): during P1 (7 d), all pigs were fed their respective diets ad libitum and housed in TN conditions (20.84 ± 0.03 °C, 47.11 ± 0.42% relative humidity). During P2 (7 d), HSCtl and HSZn pigs were exposed to progressive cyclical HS conditions (27 to 30 °C, 41.9 ± 0.5% relative humidity), while TNCtl, PFCtl, and PFZn pigs remained in TN conditions and were fed ad libitum or pair-fed to their respective HSCtl and HSZn counterparts. During P3 (5 d; "recovery phase"), all pigs were housed in TN conditions and fed ad libitum. Pigs exposed to HS had overall increased rectal temperature, skin temperature, and respiration rate (0.33 °C, 3.76 °C, and 27 bpm, respectively; P < 0.01). Relative to TN controls, HS decreased ADFI and ADG (28 and 35%, respectively; P < 0.05), but these variables were unaffected by dietary treatment. Additionally, circulating insulin did not differ between HS and TN pigs (P = 0.41), but was decreased in PF relative to TN pigs (P < 0.01). During recovery, no differences were observed in rectal temperature or respiration rate across treatments, but HSZn pigs had decreased skin temperature relative to TN, PF, and HSCtl pigs (P < 0.01). During P3, no Zn effects were observed in production parameters; however, PF pigs had increased ADFI and ADG relative to TN and HS treatments (P < 0.01). During P3, circulating insulin was increased in pigs that were HS relative to TN and PF pigs (75%, P < 0.05). Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) levels were decreased during P3 (P = 0.04) in Zn relative to Ctl-fed pigs. Circulating lipopolysaccharide-binding protein was not different among periods (P > 0.10). In summary, Zn reduced TNFα (regardless of HS), and the stimulatory effect of HS on insulin secretion is amplified during HS recovery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27924137>Exercise-induced stress behavior, -microbiota-brain axis and diet: a systematic review for athletes.</a></h1><p>Fatigue, mood disturbances, under performance and gastrointestinal distress are common among athletes during training and competition. The psychosocial and physical demands during intense exercise can initiate a stress response activating the sympathetic-adrenomedullary and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axes, resulting in the release of stress and catabolic hormones, inflammatory cytokines and microbial molecules. The  is home to trillions of microorganisms that have fundamental roles in many aspects of human biology, including metabolism, endocrine, neuronal and immune function. The  microbiome and its influence on host behavior, intestinal barrier and immune function are believed to be a critical aspect of the brain- axis. Recent evidence in murine models shows that there is a high correlation between physical and emotional stress during exercise and changes in gastrointestinal microbiota composition. For instance, induced exercise-stress decreased cecal levels of  spp and increased  which have well defined roles in intestinal mucus degradation and immune function. Diet is known to dramatically modulate the composition of the  microbiota. Due to the considerable complexity of stress responses in elite athletes (from   to increased catabolism and depression), defining standard diet regimes is difficult. However, some preliminary experimental data obtained from studies using probiotics and prebiotics studies show some interesting results, indicating that the microbiota acts like an endocrine organ (e.g. secreting serotonin, dopamine or other neurotransmitters) and may control the HPA axis in athletes. What is troubling is that dietary recommendations for elite athletes are primarily based on a low consumption of plant polysaccharides, which is associated with reduced microbiota diversity and functionality (e.g. less synthesis of byproducts such as short chain fatty acids and neurotransmitters). As more elite athletes suffer from psychological and gastrointestinal conditions that can be linked to the , targeting the microbiota therapeutically may need to be incorporated in athletes' diets that take into consideration dietary fiber as well as microbial taxa not currently present in athlete's .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30054517>Greater Microbial Translocation and Vulnerability to Metabolic Disease in Healthy Aged Female Monkeys.</a></h1><p>Monkeys demonstrate gastrointestinal barrier dysfunction ( ) as evidenced by higher biomarkers of microbial translocation (MT) and inflammation with ageing despite equivalent health status, and lifelong diet and environmental conditions.

We additionally assessed serum bovine immunoglobulin therapy to lower MT burden. MT was increased in old monkeys despite comparable histological appearance of the ascending colon. Microbiome profiles from 16S sequencing did not show large differences by age grouping, but there was evidence for higher mucosal bacterial loads using qPCR. Innate immune responses were increased in old monkeys consistent with higher MT burdens. Western diet challenge led to elevations in glycemic and hepatic biochemistry values only in old monkeys, and immunoglobulin therapy was not effective in reducing MT markers or improving metabolic health.

ALD encompasses a broad spectrum of hepatic injuries including asymptomatic steatosis, alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The susceptibility of alcoholic patients to develop ALD is highly variable and its progression to more advanced stages is strongly influenced by several hits (i.e., amount and duration of alcohol abuse). Among them, the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites have been recently identified as paramount in ALD pathophysiology. Ethanol abuse triggers qualitative and quantitative modifications in intestinal flora taxonomic composition, mucosal inflammation, and intestinal barrier derangement. Intestinal hypermeability results in the translocation of viable pathogenic bacteria, Gram-negative microbial products, and pro-inflammatory luminal metabolites into the bloodstream, further corroborating the alcohol-induced liver damage. Thus, the premise of this review is to discuss the beneficial effect of  microbiota modulation as a novel therapeutic approach in ALD management.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27920543>Intestinal permeability in a patient with liver cirrhosis.</a></h1><p>Liver cirrhosis is a worldwide public health problem, and patients with this disease are at high risk of developing complications, bacterial translocation from the intestinal lumen to the mesenteric nodes, and systemic circulation, resulting in the development of severe complications related to high mortality rate. The intestinal barrier is a structure with a physical and biochemical activity to maintain balance between the external environment, including bacteria and their products, and the internal environment.

This study investigated whether bacterial translocation is associated with perinatal depression and anxiety scores and with prenatal physio-somatic symptoms and immune-inflammatory biomarkers, including the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway.Data were collected in pregnant women at the end of term (T1) and 4-6 weeks after delivery (T2) as well as in non-pregnant controls. We examined the associations between serum IgM/IgA responses to Gram-B at the end of term and depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale -EPDS) and anxiety (Spielberger's State Anxiety Inventory -STAI) symptoms.Levels of C-reactive protein, zinc, haptoglobin, hematocrit and IgA/IgM responses to 9 TRYCATs were also measured. No significant associations of the IgA/IgM responses to Gram-B with prenatal depression and anxiety were observed. Increased IgA/IgM responses to Gram-B predict higher levels of haptoglobin, hematocrit and TRYCATs, in particular quinolinic acid and the quinolinic acid / kynurenic acid ratio. IgA responses to Gram-B were significantly lowered in pregnant women compared to age-matched non-pregnant women, while IgM responses were significantly elevated in participants with alcohol consumption. Physio-somatic symptoms at the end of term were significantly associated with IgM responses to Klebsiella pneumonia. Postnatal anxiety was significantly predicted by IgA responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Our findings suggest that pregnancy may protect against bacterial translocation, while alcohol use may increase bacterial translocation.

Eighty four patients with schizophrenia and 40 healthy controls were assessed using the 12 item Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Rating scale (FF) and scales for negative and positive symptoms, depression and anxiety. Cognitive functioning was tested using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). Other assessments included: immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgM responses to tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), namely quinolinic (QA), 3-OH-kynurenine (3HK), picolinic (PA), xanthurenic (XA) and kynurenic acid (KA) and anthranilic acid (AA). More than 50% of the patients studied had elevated levels of physio-somatic (PS) symptoms, significantly co-occurring with depression and anxiety, but not with negative or positive symptoms. PS symptoms were significantly associated with IgA/IgM responses to TRYCATs, including increased IgA responses to 3 HK, PA and XA, and lowered IgA to QA and AA. Fatigue, muscle pain and tension, autonomic and cognitive symptoms and a flu-like malaise were strongly associated with cognitive impairments in spatial planning and working memory, paired associative learning, visual sustained attention and attention set shifting.

Subjects whose serum endotoxin concentration increased by at least 5-fold from pre-meal levels at 5-h post-prandial were considered "responders" and were randomized to receive either placebo (rice flour) or a commercial spore-based probiotic supplement [Bacillus indicus (HU36), Bacillus subtilis (HU58), Bacillus coagulans, and Bacillus licheniformis, and Bacillus clausii] for 30-d. The dietary endotoxemia test was repeated at the conclusion of the supplementation period. Dietary endotoxin (LAL) and triglycerides (enzymatic) were measured using an automated chemistry analyzer. Serum disease risk biomarkers were measured using bead-based multiplex assays (Luminex and Milliplex) as secondary, exploratory measures.Data were statistically analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and a  < 0.05.

Severe thermal injury triggers intestinal inflammation that contributes to intestinal epithelial hyperpermeability, which exacerbates systemic response leading to multiple organ failure and sepsis. In this study, we identified a significant function of a particular palmitoyl acyltransferase, zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein-21 (ZDHHC21), in mediating signaling events required for  hyperpermeability induced by inflammation. Using quantitative PCR, we show that ZDHHC21 mRNA production was enhanced twofold when intestinal epithelial cells were treated with TNF-α-IFN-γ in vitro. In addition, pharmacological targeting of palmitoyl acyltransferases with 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) showed significant improvement in TNF-α-IFN-γ-mediated epithelial barrier dysfunction by using electric cell-substrate impedance-sensing assays, as well as FITC-labeled dextran permeability assays. Using acyl-biotin exchange assay and click chemistry, we show that TNF-α-IFN-γ treatment of intestinal epithelial cells results in enhanced detection of total palmitoylated proteins and this response is inhibited by 2-BP. Using ZDHHC21-deficient mice or wild-type mice treated with 2-BP, we showed that mice with impaired ZDHHC21 expression or pharmacological inhibition resulted in attenuated intestinal barrier dysfunction caused by thermal injury. Moreover, hematoxylin and eosin staining of the small intestine, as well as transmission electron microscopy, showed that mice with genetic interruption of ZDHHC21 had attenuated villus structure disorganization associated with thermal injury-induced intestinal barrier damage. Taken together, these results suggest an important role of ZDHHC21 in mediating  hyperpermeability resulting from thermal injury. Increased mucosal permeability in the  is one of the major complications following severe burn. Here we report the novel finding that zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein-21 (ZDHHC21) mediates  epithelial hyperpermeability resulting from an experimental model of thermal injury. The hyperpermeability response was significantly attenuated with a pharmacological inhibitor of palmitoyl acyltransferases and in mice with genetic ablation of ZDHHC21. These findings suggest that ZDHHC21 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for treating burn-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30173208> dysbiosis,  , and intestinal epithelial proliferation in neurological disorders: towards the development of a new therapeutic using amino acids, prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics.</a></h1><p>Here we offer a review of the evidence for a hypothesis that a combination of ingestible probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and amino acids will help ameliorate dysbiosis and degeneration of the , and therefore promote restoration of nervous system function in a number of neurological indications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28936406> Microbiome-based Therapeutics in Liver Cirrhosis: Basic Consideration for the Next Step.</a></h1><p>Infections account for significant morbidity and mortality in liver cirrhosis and most are related to the  microbiome. Fecal dysbiosis, characterized by an overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in autochthonous non-pathogenic bacteria, becomes prominent with the progression of liver cirrhosis. In cirrhotic patients, disruption of the intestinal barrier causes intestinal hyperpermeability (i.e.  ), which is closely related to  dysmotility, dysbiosis and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and may induce pathological bacterial translocation. Although the involved microbial taxa are somewhat different between the cirrhotic patients from the East and the West, the common manifestation of a shortage of bacteria that contribute to the production of short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids may facilitate intestinal inflammation,   and  dysbiosis. Translocated endotoxin and bacterial DNA are capable of provoking potent inflammation and affecting the metabolic and hemodynamic systems, which may ultimately enhance the progression of liver cirrhosis and its various complications, such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE), variceal bleeding, infection and renal disturbances. Among studies on the microbiome-based therapeutics, findings of probiotic effects on HE have been contradictory in spite of several supportive results. However, the effects of synbiotics and prebiotics are substantially documented. The background of their effectiveness should be evaluated again in relation to the cirrhosis-related changes in  microbiome and their metabolic effects. Strict indications for the antibiotic rifaximin remain unestablished, although its effect is promising, improving HE and other complications with little influence on microbial populations. The final goal of microbiome-based therapeutics is to adjust the -liver axis to the maximal benefit of cirrhotic patients, with the aid of evolving metagenomic and metabolomic analyses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31251335>Analysis of Genetic Association of Intestinal Permeability in Healthy First-degree Relatives of Patients with Crohn's Disease.</a></h1><p>Excessive intestinal permeability or intestinal barrier dysfunction as measured by various assays has been observed in various diseases. However, little is known about the factors contributing to altered  permeability in these diseases. Our objective was to determine the genetic determinants of altered  permeability as measured by the lactulose mannitol fractional excretion ratio (LacMan ratio) in 1075 healthy first-degree relatives of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). In a targeted analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in genes associated with intestinal barrier function related or not to inflammatory bowel disease, we did not find a significant association with intestinal permeability. In an untargeted genome-wide association analysis, the top 100 associations were located in 22 genomic loci, although they were not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing (raw P values [1.8 × 10-7 - 1.4 × 10-5]. The lowest P value was obtained for rs9616637 (22q13.33, C22orf34), for which the minor allele A was associated with a decreased LacMan ratio. These results suggest that host genetic background has limited contribution toward intestinal permeability. Despite this, our study is currently the largest of its kind assessing  permeability in vivo. It remains possible that smaller genetic effect sizes on LacMan ratio are not detectable in this sized cohort. Larger studies are warranted to identify the potential genetic contribution to intestinal permeability.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

SHANK3 mutations are associated with autism, and patients with autism are known to have higher proportions of inflammatory bowel disease. Here, we explore the role of SHANK3 in inflammatory bowel disease, both in vivo and in vitro.Dextran sulfate sodium colitis was induced in SHANK3 knockout mice. Transepithelial electrical resistance, paracellular permeability, and Salmonella invasion assays were used to evaluate epithelial barrier function, in vitro and in vivo. Expression of tight junction proteins, protein kinases, and MAP kinase phosphorylation changes were analyzed by immunoblotting after overexpression or knockdown of SHANK3 expression. SHANK3 expression in intestinal tissue from patients with Crohn's disease was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry.SHANK3 knockout mice were more susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium. SHANK3 knockout resulted in a  epithelial barrier phenotype, as demonstrated by decreased transepithelial electrical resistance, increased paracellular permeability, and increased Salmonella invasion. Overexpression of SHANK3 enhanced ZO-1 expression, and knockdown of SHANK3 resulted in decreased expression of ZO-1. Regulation of ZO-1 expression by SHANK3 seems to be mediated through a PKCε-dependent pathway. SHANK3 expression correlated with ZO-1 and PKCε in colonic tissue of patients with Crohn's disease.The expression level of SHANK3 affects ZO-1 expression and the barrier function in intestinal epithelial cells.

Our objective was to describe the effects of critical illness on duodenal morphology and ultrastructure.Prospective observational study of 12 mechanically ventilated critically ill patients in an intensive care unit and 15 control participants in an outpatient endoscopy suite.We took six endoscopic biopsy samples of the duodenum from each participant for analysis by electron and light microscopy.Our primary outcome was tight junction morphology, examined with electron microscopy. Secondary outcomes were microvillus length and density, vascular endothelium morphology and mitochondrial density and morphology, examined with electron microscopy, and morphology examined with light microscopy.We observed no abnormalities of tight junction ultrastructure in either group. There was a tendency towards shorter microvilli in the critically ill group: mean length in critically ill patients, 1.17 µm (interquartile range [IQR], 1.05-1.60 µm) v mean length in control patients, 1.58 µm (IQR, 1.30-1.72 µm); P = 0.07. There was a tendency towards less dense microvilli in the critically ill group: mean density in critically ill patients, 7.29 microvilli/µm (IQR, 6.83-8.05 microvilli/µm) v mean density in control patients, 8.23 microvilli/µm (IQR, 7.34-9.11 microvilli/µm); P = 0.07. Vascular endothelium appeared normal in all critically ill patients and abnormal in one control participant. Abnormal mitochondrial morphology was noted in one critically ill patient and one control participant, and no differences were seen in mitochondrial density. Using light microscopy, we saw more apoptotic cells in the critically ill patients (P = 0.018), but villus height, crypt depth and lymphocyte density were normal.We did not detect any morphological abnormalities of duodenal tight junctions in critically ill patients.

The  or gastrointestinal tract is a major immune organ equipped with the largest pool of immune cells representing more than 70% of the entire immune system and the largest population of macrophages in the human body. The bidirectional communication between the brain and the  is commonly known as brain- or -brain axis. Stroke often leads to  dysmotility,  microbiota dysbiosis, "" ,  hemorrhage, and even -origin sepsis, which is often associated with poor prognosis. Emerging evidence suggests that  inflammatory and immune response plays a key role in the pathophysiology of stroke and may become a key therapeutic target for its treatment. Ischemic brain tissue produces damage-associated molecular patterns to initiate innate and adaptive immune response both locally and systemically through the specialized pattern-recognition receptors (e.g., toll-like receptors). After stroke, innate immune cells including neutrophils, microglia or macrophages, mast cells, innate lymphocytes (IL-17 secreting γδ T-cell), and natural killer T-cell respond within hours, followed by the adaptive immune response through activation of T and B lymphocytes. Subpopulations of T-cells can help or worsen ischemic brain injury. Pro-inflammatory Th1, Th17, and γδ T-cells are often associated with increased inflammatory damage, whereas regulatory T-cells are known to suppress postischemic inflammation by increasing the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Although known to play a key role, research in the  inflammatory and immune response after stroke is still in its initial stage. A better understanding of the  inflammatory and immune response after stroke may be important for the development of effective stroke therapies. The present review will discuss recent advances in the studies of the brain- axis after stroke, the key issues to be solved, and the future directions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28588585>  As a Danger Signal for Autoimmune Diseases.</a></h1><p>The intestinal epithelial lining, together with factors secreted from it, forms a barrier that separates the host from the environment.

It is long appreciated that bacterial metabolites affect the host's physiology. The inner lining of the intestinal tract is the first level of interaction between the host and bacteria and their metabolites. Therefore, we set out to test the effects of five common dietary fibres (oat β-glucan 28%; oat β-glucan 94%; dried chicory root containing inulin 75%; xylo-oligosaccharide; inulin 90%) and maltodextrin, after fermentation by human  microbiota in vitro, on measures of  barrier integrity using a Caco-2/HT29-MTX co-culture as well as mucus production and immune parameters using HT29-MTX and HT29 cell models, respectively. Our data show that all fibres, fermentation products increased the tightness of the  barrier with oat β-glucan 28% having the largest effect. Fermentation supernatants were tested also in models of the compromised  barrier ( ). After the addition of ethanol as basolateral stressor, only fermentation supernatant of oat β-glucan 28%, oat β-glucan 94% and maltodextrin improved the  barrier integrity, while oat β-glucan 28% and dried chicory root containing inulin 75% significantly improved the  barrier integrity after addition of rhamnolipids as apical stressor. Using the Luminex Technology, we demonstrated an important role of oat β-glucan fermentation products in modulating cytokine and chemokine productions. Furthermore, treating the goblet cells with effluent from xylo-oligosaccharide fermentation significantly increased mucus production. In summary, our data emphasize the potential positive effects of fermentation supernatant of dietary fibres on -related physiological outcomes and show that prebiotic fibres may have promising potential to induce specific  health benefits.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968463>Unexplained inflammation in end-stage kidney disease: Is the combination of enhanced gastrointestinal permeability and reticuloendothelial dysfunction its cause?</a></h1><p>Unexplained chronic inflammation is prevalent in end-stage kidney disease, and contributes toward accelerated cardiovascular disease, and premature death. The source of inflammation is unclear, although increased gastrointestinal permeability is a likely contributory factor. Whether a ""  leads to penetration of the systemic circulation by -derived pathogens is at least partly dependent on Kupffer cell function. These resident liver macrophages are an important part of the reticuloendothelial system (RES), and there is evidence for Kupffer cell and reticuloendothelial dysfunction in chronic kidney disease. These observations are compatible with the inflammatory milieu of chronic kidney disease being of  origin. Measuring  permeability in chronic kidney disease is challenging. Use of fecal biomarkers and other novel serum biomarkers represent potential alternative tools. One such marker is (1-3)-Beta-D-glucan, a polysaccharide constituent of many fungal, bacterial, and plant cell walls; levels of (1-3)-Beta-D-glucan are elevated in hemodialysis patients. Gastrointestinal permeability and impaired removal by the RES may contribute to these high levels, suggesting potential importance as a biomarker. High levels of (1-3)-Beta-D-glucan also falsely elevate endotoxin measurements. Measuring the contribution of gastrointestinal permeability and RES dysfunction to systemic inflammation may be an important step in designing therapies to reduce systemic inflammation in chronic kidney disease.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31077000>Breakdown of the Paracellular Tight and Adherens Junctions in the  and Blood Brain Barrier and Damage to the Vascular Barrier in Patients with Deficit Schizophrenia.</a></h1><p>Deficit schizophrenia is characterized by  intestinal tight and adherens junctions and bacterial translocation. Here we examine whether (deficit) schizophrenia is accompanied by  paracellular, transcellular, and vascular barriers in the  and blood-brain barriers. We measured IgA responses to occludin, claudin-5, E-cadherin, and β-catenin (paracellular pathway, PARA); talin, actin, vinculin, and epithelial intermediate filament (transcellular pathway, TRANS); and plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP, vascular pathway) in 78 schizophrenia patients and 40 controls. IgA responses to claudin-5, E-cadherin, and β-catenin, the sum of the four PARA proteins, and the ratio PARA/TRANS were significantly higher in deficit schizophrenia patients than in nondeficit schizophrenia patients and controls. A large part of the variance in PHEMN (psychosis, hostility, excitation, mannerism, and negative) symptoms, psychomotor retardation, formal thought disorders, verbal fluency, word list memory, word list recall, and executive functions was explained by the PARA/TRANS ratio coupled with plasma IgA responses to Gram-negative bacteria, IgM to malondialdehyde, CCL-11 (eotaxin), IgA levels of the ratio of noxious to more protective tryptophan catabolites (NOX/PRO TRYCATs), and a plasma immune activation index. Moreover, IgA levels to Gram-negative bacteria were significantly associated with IgA to E-cadherin, β-catenin, and PLVAP, while IgA levels to claudin-5 were significantly predicted by IgA to E-cadherin, NOX/PRO TRYCAT ratio, Gram-negative bacteria, and CCL11. The phenomenology of the deficit syndrome is to a large extent explained by the cumulative effects of lowered natural IgM, breakdown of the paracellular and vascular pathways, increased bacterial translocation, peripheral immune-inflammatory responses, and indices of BBB breakdown.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27847926>The brain- axis dysfunctions and hypersensitivity to food antigens in the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia.</a></h1><p>Despite over 100-year history of research on schizophrenia, its etiology is still not fully understood, which might be due to the significant heterogeneity in terms of both its course, as well as the etiopathogenesis. One of the best-proven mediating mechanisms in the development of schizophrenia is the immuno-inflammatory response, the sources of which are believed to be the dysfunctions of brain- axis and pathological processes occurring in the intestines. This paper is a review of the literature on this subject which presents factors both involved in the functioning of brain- axis and important for the development of schizophrenia, i.e. 1. intestinal microbiome (intestinal microbiota), 2. permeable intestine (  syndrome), 3. hypersensitivity to food antigens, including gluten and casein of cow's milk. Research results seem to be very promising and indicate the possibility of improved clinical outcomes in some patients with schizophrenia by modifying diet, use of probiotics, and the implementation of antibiotic therapy of specific treatment groups.

Globally, it affects 30⁻50 million individuals, with an estimated increase of approximately 200 million by 2020 and approximately 300 million by 2040. Currently, the neovascular form may be able to be treated with the use of anti-VEGF drugs, while no effective treatments are available for the dry form. Many studies, such as the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and AREDS 2, have shown a potential role of micronutrient supplementation in lowering the risk of progression of the early stages of AMD.

We evaluated the effect of DIM on the intestinal permeability of human intestinal cell monolayers and the animal model  which were treated with IL-1β and , respectively, to mimic IBD conditions. DIM substantially restored the intestinal permeability of differentiated Caco-2 cells by enhancing the expression of tight junction proteins (including occludin and ZO-1). Compared to the IL-1β single treatment (551.0 ± 49.0 Ω·cm), DIM (10 μM) significantly increased the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of Caco-2 cell monolayers (919.0 ± 66.4 Ω·cm,  < 0.001).

This hypothesis involves microbes (archaea and bacteria) that exist in human body biofilms in syntrophic associations, where bacteria ferment nutrients to produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that are used by methanogenic archaeons to produce methane. Overgrowth of archaea on human tissues (e.g., in association with intestines, teeth or lungs) results in excessive removal of SCFAs from the biofilms and this triggers bacteria in the free-living biofilm state to convert to the endoparasitic state and become intracellular in host cells where they incite inflammation and disease. The proposed model provides the mechanism to explain dysbiosis etiology of several human diseases, including gingivitis,   syndrome, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, among others.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Although extensive studies have been conducted, the progress in developing effective therapies for these diseases has still been slow. The current dilemma reminds us that the human being is a superorganism. Only when we take the human self and its partner microbiota into consideration at the same time, can we better understand these diseases. Over the last few centuries, the partner microbiota has experienced tremendous change, much more than human genes, because of the modern transformations in diet, lifestyle, medical care, and so on, parallel to the modern epidemiological transition. Existing research indicates that  microbiota plays an important role in this transition. According to -brain psychology, the  microbiota is a crucial part of the -brain network, and it communicates with the brain via the microbiota--brain axis. The  microbiota almost develops synchronously with the -brain, brain, and mind. The  microbiota influences various normal mental processes and mental phenomena, and is involved in the pathophysiology of numerous mental and neurological diseases. Targeting the microbiota in therapy for these diseases is a promising approach that is supported by three theories: the  microbiota hypothesis, the "old friend" hypothesis, and the   theory. The effects of  microbiota on the brain and behavior are fulfilled by the microbiota--brain axis, which is mainly composed of the nervous pathway, endocrine pathway, and immune pathway. Undoubtedly, -brain psychology will bring great enhancement to psychology, neuroscience, and psychiatry. Various microbiota-improving methods including fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, a healthy diet, and healthy lifestyle have shown the capability to promote the function of the -brain, microbiota--brain axis, and brain.

In this review, we aim to: (1) overview the epidemiological links between MDD, obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus; (2) discuss the role of synergistic neurotoxic effects in MDD comorbid with obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus; (3) review evidence of intestinal dysbiosis,   and increased bacterial translocation, in the pathophysiology of MDD, obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus; and (4) propose a model in which the -brain axis could play a pivotal role in the comorbidity of these disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28438331>[The intestinal microbiota: A new player in depression?]</a></h1><p>Depression is the leading cause of disability in the world according to the World Health Organization. The effectiveness of the available antidepressant therapies is limited. Data from the literature suggest that some subtypes of depression may be associated with chronic low grade inflammation. The uncovering of the role of intestinal microbiota in the development of the immune system and its bidirectional communication with the brain have led to growing interest on reciprocal interactions between inflammation, microbiota and depression. Our purpose is to review the state of knowledge on these interactions.We carried out a literature search on Pubmed, Go pubmed, psyC info, Elsevier, Embase until August 13, 2016 using the keywords "depression", "microbiota" and "inflammation".Dysbiosis reported in patients suffering from depression seems to contribute to low grade systemic inflammation which in turn feeds back depression. The hypothetical mechanisms behind these interactions are multiple:  , hyperreactivity of the corticotropic axis, disturbed neurotransmission. Abnormal microbial exposure during childhood and perinatal stress are reported to influence both the maturation of the immune system and the microbiota hence contributing to the ethiopathogeny of depression. There is no evidence in the literature to support a role for diet.The evidence supporting a causal relationship between dysbiosis and depression through low grade inflammation is limited and precludes us from drawing firm conclusions. Further studies are needed to improve our knowledge.Copyright © 2017 L'Encéphale, Paris. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Mounting evidence suggests that patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an altered composition of  microbiota. This leads to 1) the increased fermentation of intestinal proteins to uremic toxins such as p-cresyl sulphate and indoxyl sulphate, 2) an altered, more '' intestinal barrier, and 3) translocation of bacteria and toxins from the  lumen to the circulation, inducing systemic inflammation. This may contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality in this population. Future studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis, and to assess whether manipulating the intestinal microbiota with pre-, pro-, or symbiotics may alter the development and course of CKD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31478105>Microbiome and Mental Health, Specifically as It Relates to Adolescents.</a></h1><p>This article reviews the relationship of the microbiome, the -brain axis, and depression. It also will review factors which can influence this relationship, such as chronic stress, medications, and the Western diet typically consumed by adolescents.Changes in the  microbiome increase the release of microbial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) which activate a  inflammatory response.  pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulate the afferent vagal nerve which in turn impacts the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis inducing symptoms associated with depression. Recent research suggests that  inflammation can induce neuroinflammation which, in turn, stimulates microglia activation and the kynurenine pathway and can activate systemic inflammation-inducing depressive symptoms. Promoting a healthy diet and lifestyle changes, limiting exposure to pesticides, limiting medications that affect the microbiome and the use of such things pre/probiotics and other interventions may complement existing efforts to curb the rise in depression.

The microbiome, intestinal compositional changes, and resultant bacterial translocation add a new element to the bidirectional interactions of the -brain axis; new evidence implicates these pathways in the patho-aetiology of MDD. In addition, abnormalities in the -brain axis are associated with several chronic non-communicable disorders, which frequently co-occur in individuals with MDD, including but not limited to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE database up until May 1, 2016 for studies which investigated intestinal dysbiosis and bacterial translocation (the ' ') in the pathophysiology of MDD and co-occurring somatic comorbidities with an emphasis on IBS, CFS, obesity, and T2DM.The composition of the  microbiota is influenced by several genetic and environmental factors (e.g. diet).

Fourteen lactating Holstein cows (parity 2.6 ± 0.3; 117 ± 18 d in milk) were enrolled in 2 experimental periods. Period 1 (5 d) served as the baseline for period 2 (7 d), during which cows received 1 of 2 i.v. treatments twice per day: sterile saline or a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI; 1.5 mg/kg of body weight). Gamma-secretase inhibitors reduce intestinal barrier function by inhibiting crypt cell differentiation into absorptive enterocytes. During period 2, control cows receiving sterile saline were pair-fed (PF) to the GSI-treated cows, and all cows were killed at the end of period 2. Administering GSI increased goblet cell area 218, 70, and 28% in jejunum, ileum, and colon, respectively. In the jejunum, GSI-treated cows had increased crypt depth and reduced villus height, villus height-to-crypt depth ratio, cell proliferation, and mucosal surface area. Plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein increased with time, and tended to be increased 42% in GSI-treated cows relative to PF controls on d 5 to 7. Circulating haptoglobin and serum amyloid A concentrations increased (585- and 4.4-fold, respectively) similarly in both treatments. Administering GSI progressively reduced dry matter intake (66%) and, by design, the pattern and magnitude of decreased nutrient intake was similar in PF controls. A similar progressive decrease (42%) in milk yield occurred in both treatments, but we observed no treatment effects on milk components. Cows treated with GSI tended to have increased plasma insulin (68%) and decreased circulating nonesterified fatty acids (29%) compared with PF cows. For both treatments, plasma glucose decreased with time while β-hydroxybutyrate progressively increased. Liver triglycerides increased 221% from period 1 to sacrifice in both treatments. No differences were detected in liver weight, liver moisture, or body weight change. Intentionally compromising intestinal barrier function caused inflammation, altered metabolism, and markedly reduced feed intake and milk yield.

All patients reduced their weight to a mean ± SD BMI of 36.4 ± 5.1 within 12 mo. We assessed barrier functions by the oral Lac:Man and the fecal zonulin tests. Insulin resistance was assessed by the homeostatic model assessment index (HOMA), and liver steatosis by sonography and the fatty liver index (FLI).The Lac:Man ratio and circulating interleukin (IL) 6 concentration decreased during intervention from 0.080 (95% CI: 0.073, 0.093) to 0.027 (95% CI: 0.024, 0.034; P < 0.001) and from 4.2 ± 1.4 to 2.8 ± 1.6 pg/mL (P < 0.01), respectively. At study start, the Lac:Man ratio was higher in patients with moderate or severe steatosis than in those without any steatosis (P < 0.001). The Lac:Man ratio tended to correlate with HOMA (ρ = 0.55, P = 0.052), which correlated with FLI (ρ = 0.75, P < 0.01). A multiple-regression analysis led to a final model explaining FLI best through BMI, waist circumference, and the Lac:Man ratio.Intestinal permeability is increased in obese patients with steatosis compared with obese patients without.

We investigated whether impaired intestinal permeability contributes to these symptoms.We performed a prospective study of intestinal permeability, measured by endoscopic confocal laser endomicroscopy in 110 consecutive subjects (31 with ulcerative colitis [UC], 57 with Crohn's disease [CD], and 22 healthy individuals [controls]) in Sydney, Australia from May 2009 and September 2015. Symptomatic CD was defined by a CD Activity Index score of 150 or more and symptomatic UC by a partial Mayo score of 2 or more. Mucosal healing was defined as CD Endoscopic Index of Severity of 0 in CD or Mayo endoscopic sub-score of 0-1 for patients with UC. Intestinal permeability was quantified by the Confocal Leak Score (CLS; range: 0=no impaired permeability to 100=complete loss of barrier function). The primary endpoint was intestinal permeability in patients with symptomatic IBD in mucosal healing vs patients with asymptomatic IBD in mucosal healing. We determined the sensitivity and specificity of CLS in determining symptoms based on receiver operating characteristic analysis.Ongoing bowel symptoms were present in 16.3% of patients with IBD and mucosal healing (15.4% of patients with CD, 17.4% with UC). Patients with symptomatic IBD had a significantly higher median CLS (19.0) than patients with asymptomatic IBD (7.3; P < .001) or controls (5.9, P < .001). There were no significant differences between patients with IBD in remission vs controls (P = .261). Median CLS was significantly higher in patients with symptomatic than asymptomatic CD (17.7 vs 8.1; P = .009) and patients with symptomatic than asymptomatic UC (22.2 vs 6.9; P = .021). A CLS of 13.1 or more identified ongoing bowel symptoms in patients with IBD and mucosal healing with 95.2% sensitivity and 97.6% specificity; the receiver operating characteristic area under curve value was 0.88. Based on this cutoff, 36.2% of patients with IBD in mucosal healing have increased intestinal permeability. On regression analysis, every increase in CLS of 1.9 correlated with an additional diarrheal motion per day (P = .008).In a prospective study of intestinal permeability in patients with IBD and mucosal healing, we associated impaired intestinal permeability with ongoing bowel symptoms; increases in permeability correlated with increased severity of diarrhea.

Immunosuppressants used in treatment put patients at a higher risk of infections. New knowledge of disease modulators, such as symbiotic bacteria, can enable fine-tuning of parts of the immune system, rather than suppressing it altogether.Dysbiosis of  microbiota promotes autoimmune disorders that damage extraintestinal organs. Here we report a role of  microbiota in the pathogenesis of renal dysfunction in lupus. Using a classical model of lupus nephritis, MRL/lpr, we found a marked depletion of Lactobacillales in the  microbiota. Increasing Lactobacillales in the  improved renal function of these mice and prolonged their survival. We used a mixture of 5 Lactobacillus strains (Lactobacillus oris, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus johnsonii, and Lactobacillus gasseri), but L. reuteri and an uncultured Lactobacillus sp. accounted for most of the observed effects. Further studies revealed that MRL/lpr mice possessed a "" , which was reversed by increased Lactobacillus colonization. Lactobacillus treatment contributed to an anti-inflammatory environment by decreasing IL-6 and increasing IL-10 production in the . In the circulation, Lactobacillus treatment increased IL-10 and decreased IgG2a that is considered to be a major immune deposit in the kidney of MRL/lpr mice. Inside the kidney, Lactobacillus treatment also skewed the Treg-Th17 balance towards a Treg phenotype. These beneficial effects were present in female and castrated male mice, but not in intact males, suggesting that the  microbiota controls lupus nephritis in a sex hormone-dependent manner.This work demonstrates essential mechanisms on how changes of the  microbiota regulate lupus-associated immune responses in mice. Future studies are warranted to determine if these results can be replicated in human subjects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27793215>Intestinal Barrier and Behavior.</a></h1><p>The intestinal barrier function contributes to  homeostasis by modulating absorption of water, electrolytes, and nutrients from the lumen into the circulation while restricting the passage of noxious luminal substances and microorganisms. Chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and celiac disease are associated to intestinal barrier dysfunction. Here, the hypothesis is that a  intestinal wall allowing for indiscriminate passage of intraluminal compounds to the vascular compartment could in turn lead to systemic inflammation. An increasing number of studies are now investigating the association between  permeability and CNS disorders, under the premise that translocation of intestinal luminal contents could affect CNS function, either directly or indirectly. Still, it is unknown whether disruption of intestinal barrier is a causative agent or a consequence in these situations.

A healthy host-microorganisms balance must be respected in order to optimally maintain the intestinal barrier and immune system functions and, consequently, prevent disease development. In the past several decades, the adoption of modern dietary habits has become a growing health concern, as it is strongly associated with obesity and related metabolic diseases, promoting inflammation and both structural and behavioral changes in  microbiota. In this context, novel dietary strategies are emerging to prevent diseases and maintain health. However, the consequences of these different diets on  microbiota modulation are still largely unknown, and could potentially lead to alterations of  microbiota, intestinal barrier, and the immune system. The present review aimed to focus on the impact of single food components (macronutrients and micronutrients), salt, food additives, and different dietary habits (i.e., vegan and vegetarian, gluten-free, ketogenic, high sugar, low FODMAP, Western-type, and Mediterranean diets) on  microbiota composition in order to define the optimal diet for a healthy modulation of  microbiota.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31206525>Lubiprostone as a potential therapeutic agent to improve intestinal permeability and prevent the development of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice.</a></h1><p>The interaction between atherosclerosis and commensal microbes through   syndrome (LGS), which is characterized by impaired intestinal permeability and the introduction of undesired pathogens into the body, has not been fully elucidated. Our aim was to investigate the potential role of a ClC-2 chloride channel activator, lubiprostone, which is reported to have beneficial effects on LGS, in the development of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice. After a 15-week feeding period of a Western diet (WD), ApoE-/- mice were treated with a Western-type diet (WD) alone or WD with oral supplementation of lubiprostone for 10 weeks. This feeding protocol was followed by experimental evaluation of LGS and atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta. In mice with lubiprostone, in vivo translocation of orally administered 4-kDa FITC-dextran was significantly improved, and RNA expression of the epithelial tight junction proteins, Zo-1 and occludin, was significantly up-regulated in the ileum, compared to the WD alone group, suggesting a possible reversal of WD-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction. As a result, WD-induced exacerbation of atherosclerotic lesion formation was reduced by 69% in longitudinally opened aortas and 26% in aortic root regions. In addition, there was a significant decrease in circulating immunoglobulin level, followed by an attenuation of inflammatory responses in the perivascular adipose tissue, as evidenced by reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Lubiprostone attenuates atherosclerosis by ameliorating LGS-induced inflammation through the restoration of the intestinal barrier. These findings raise the possibility of targeting LGS for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30098513>Marital distress, depression, and a  : Translocation of bacterial endotoxin as a pathway to inflammation.</a></h1><p>Marital distress and depression work in tandem to escalate risks for inflammation-related disorders. Translocation of bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) from the  microbiota to blood circulation stimulates systemic inflammatory responses.To investigate increased  permeability (a " ") as one potential mechanistic pathway from marital distress and depression to heightened inflammation, this secondary analysis of a double-blind, randomized crossover study examined serial assessments of two endotoxin biomarkers, LPS-binding protein (LBP) and soluble CD14 (sCD14), as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) during two separate 9.5 h visits. The 43 (N = 86) healthy married couples, ages 24-61 (mean = 38.22), discussed a marital disagreement during both visits; behavioral coding of these interactions provided data on hostile marital behaviors, a hallmark of marital distress. The Structured Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV assessed participants' mood disorder history.Participants with more hostile marital interactions had higher LBP than those who were less hostile. Additionally, the combination of more hostile marital interactions with a mood disorder history was associated with higher LBP/sCD14 ratios. Higher LBP and LBP/sCD14 were associated with greater CRP production; for example, only 21% of low LBP participants (lowest quartile) had average CRP across the day > 3, compared to 79% of those in the highest quartile. Higher sCD14 was associated with higher IL-6.These bacterial LPS translocation data illustrate how a distressed marriage and a mood disorder history can promote a proinflammatory milieu through increased  permeability, thus fueling inflammation-related disorders.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Interestingly, functional and inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases are often reported as a comorbidity in ASDs, indicating -brain axis as a novel emerging approach. Recently, a central role for peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-α has been addressed in neurological functions, associated with the behaviour. Among endogenous lipids, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a PPAR-α agonist, has been extensively studied for its anti-inflammatory effects both at central and peripheral level. Based on this background, the aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacological effects of PEA on autistic-like behaviour of BTBR T+tf/J mice and to shed light on the contributing mechanisms. Our results showed that PEA reverted the altered behavioural phenotype of BTBR mice, and this effect was contingent to PPAR-α activation. Moreover, PEA was able to restore hippocampal BDNF signalling pathway, and improve mitochondrial dysfunction, both pathological aspects, known to be consistently associated with ASDs. Furthermore, PEA reduced the overall inflammatory state of BTBR mice, reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines at hippocampal, serum, and colonic level. The analysis of  permeability and the expression of colonic tight junctions showed a reduction of   in PEA-treated BTBR mice. This finding together with PEA effect on  microbiota composition suggests an involvement of microbiota--brain axis. In conclusion, our results demonstrated a therapeutic potential of PEA in limiting ASD symptoms, through its pleiotropic mechanism of action, supporting neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory effects, and the modulation of -brain axis.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

There is an increase in proinflammatoric cytokines in the serum, which in turn can trigger migraine attacks. Probiotics can have a positive effect on the intestinal epithelium and reduce inflammatory activity. A first uncontrolled, small study of 39 migraineurs showed a decrease in the rate of attacks under the daily intake of a probiotic.In an uncontrolled observational study, the influence of a specially formulated multispecies probiotic on the frequency of migraine attacks and the intensity of migraine-associated complaints was recorded. The self-assessment of 1,020 patients was evaluated.Over the treatment period of 8 weeks, the number of headache days was reduced from 2 to 1.4 days per week. The headache intensity decreased from 5.1 to 2.1 points (0 = not present to 6 = very intensive). The migraine-associated complaints were reduced and the use of painkillers halved. All results were statistically significant (p ≤ 0.001).It can be suggested that this multispecies probiotic formulation has a positive influence on intensity and frequency of migraine attacks.

Many studies have demonstrated that the microbiome is closely associated with the progression of nutrition-related diseases, especially of fatty liver disease. Changes in the quantity and quality of the intestinal flora, commonly referred to as dysbiosis, result in altered food metabolism, increased permeability of the intestinal barrier (" ") and consecutive inflammatory processes in the liver. This favors both the progression of obesity and metabolic disorders as well as NAFLD towards non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in  dysbiosis.  dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the  wall barrier resulting in " ." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH. dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing  dysbiosis at an early stage through prebiotics and probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH. More studies are needed in humans to elicit the effect of positive airway pressure therapy on  dysbiosis.© 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28766554>Campylobacter jejuni impairs sodium transport and epithelial barrier function via cytokine release in human colon.</a></h1><p>Campylobacter jejuni is the most prevalent cause of foodborne bacterial enteritis worldwide. Patients present with diarrhea and immune responses lead to complications like arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome. Although studies exist in animal and cell models, we aimed at a functional and structural characterization of intestinal dysfunction and the involved regulatory mechanisms in human colon. First, in patients' colonic biopsies, sodium malabsorption was identified as an important diarrheal mechanism resulting from hampered epithelial ion transport via impaired epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) β- and γ-subunit. In addition, barrier dysfunction from disrupted epithelial tight junction proteins (claudin-1, -3, -4, -5, and -8), epithelial apoptosis, and appearance of lesions was detected, which cause leak-flux diarrhea and can perpetuate immune responses. Importantly, these effects in human biopsies either represent direct action of Campylobacter jejuni (ENaC impairment) or are caused by proinflammatory signaling (barrier dysfunction). This was revealed by regulator analysis from RNA-sequencing (cytometric bead array-checked) and confirmed in cell models, which identified interferon-γ, TNFα, IL-13, and IL-1β. Finally, bioinformatics' predictions yielded additional information on protective influences like vitamin D, which was confirmed in cell models. Thus, these are candidates for intervention strategies against C. jejuni infection and post-infectious sequelae, which result from the permissive barrier defect along the  .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654268>Biomarkers of   are related to inflammation and reduced physical function in older adults with cardiometabolic disease and mobility limitations.</a></h1><p>Intestinal barrier dysfunction is hypothesized to be a contributing determinant of two prominent characteristics of aging: inflammation and decline in physical function. A relationship between microbial translocation (MT), or their biomarkers (lipopolysaccharide binding protein-1 [LBP-1], soluble cluster of differentiation [sCD]-14), and physical function has been reported in healthy older adults, rats, and invertebrates. However, it is not known whether the existence of comorbidities, or clinical interventions intended to reduce comorbidities through weight loss or exercise, alters this connection. We measured inflammation, MT, and physical function in 288 overweight/obese older patients with cardiometabolic disease and self-reported mobility limitations who were enrolled in a weight loss and lifestyle intervention study. At baseline, inflammatory cytokines and LBP-1 were positively correlated after adjustment for age, gender, and body mass index. A higher LBP-1 was significantly associated with poorer physical functional after covariate adjustment. Further, even when IL-6 levels were included in the models, 400-m walk time (p = 0.003), short physical performance battery (p = 0.07), and IL-8 (p < 0.001) remained positively associated with LBP-1. Lifestyle interventions improved body mass and some functional measures; however, MT and inflammation were unchanged. MT is reliably related to inflammation, and to poorer physical function in older adults with comorbid conditions. Intestinal barrier function did not appear to improve as a result of intervention assignment, suggesting alternative strategies are needed to target this pro-inflammatory pathway in aging.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29861127>Connecting the immune system, systemic chronic inflammation and the  microbiome: The role of sex.</a></h1><p>Unresolved low grade systemic inflammation represents the underlying pathological mechanism driving immune and metabolic pathways involved in autoimmune diseases (AID). Mechanistic studies in animal models of AID and observational studies in patients have found alterations in  microbiota communities and their metabolites, suggesting a microbial contribution to the onset or progression of AID. The  microbiota and its metabolites have been shown to influence immune functions and immune homeostasis both within the  and systematically. Microbial derived-short chain fatty acid (SCFA) and bio-transformed bile acid (BA) have been shown to influence the immune system acting as ligands specific cell signaling receptors like GPRCs, TGR5 and FXR, or via epigenetic processes. Similarly, intestinal permeability ( ) and bacterial translocation are important contributors to chronic systemic inflammation and, without repair of the intestinal barrier, might represent a continuous inflammatory stimulus capable of triggering autoimmune processes. Recent studies indicate gender-specific differences in immunity, with the  microbiota shaping and being concomitantly shaped by the hormonal milieu governing differences between the sexes. A bi-directional cross-talk between microbiota and the endocrine system is emerging with bacteria being able to produce hormones (e.g. serotonin, dopamine and somatostatine), respond to host hormones (e.g. estrogens) and regulate host hormones' homeostasis (e.g by inhibiting gene prolactin transcription or converting glucocorticoids to androgens). We review herein how  microbiota and its metabolites regulate immune function, intestinal permeability and possibly AID pathological processes. Further, we describe the dysbiosis within the  microbiota observed in different AID and speculate how restoring  microbiota composition and its regulatory metabolites by dietary intervention including prebiotics and probiotics could help in preventing or ameliorating AID. Finally, we suggest that, given consistent observations of microbiota dysbiosis associated with AID and the ability of SCFA and BA to regulate intestinal permeability and inflammation, further mechanistic studies, examining how dietary microbiota modulation can protect against AID, hold considerable potential to tackle increased incidence of AID at the population level.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Although a wide array of data on the biological underpinnings of PD has not yet been linked to such -associated changes, increased  permeability and dysregulated microbiota alter many pathways germane to PD.In this article we review and integrate these wider biological changes in PD, including increased oxidative and nitrosative stress, immune-inflammatory processes, tryptophan catabolites and alterations in serotoninergic and melatoninergic pathways.These wider biological changes in PD are compatible with alterations in  permeability and changes in  microbiota. By driving tryptophan down the kynurenine pathway, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chronic stress-driven activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis decrease the availability of serotonin as a precursor for activation of the melatonergic pathways.Decreased local melatonin synthesis in glia, , neuronal and immune cells is likely to be important to the etiology, course and management of PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27607739>Dietary nitrite induces occludin nitration in the stomach.</a></h1><p>The clinical implications of the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway have been extensively studied in recent years. However, the physiological impact of bioactive nitrogen oxides produced from dietary nitrate has remained largely elusive. Here, we report a hitherto unrecognized nitrite-dependent nitrating pathway that targets tight junction proteins in the stomach. Inorganic nitrate, nitrite or saliva obtained after the consumption of lettuce were administered by oral gavage to Wistar rats. The enterosalivary circulation of nitrate was allowed to occur for 4 h after which the animals were euthanized and the stomach collected. Nitrated occludin was detected by immunoprecipitation in the gastric epithelium upon inorganic nitrite administration (p < .05) but was not observed in the case of inorganic nitrate or human saliva administration. This observation, along with differences in NO production rates from inorganic and salivary nitrite under simulated gastric conditions, suggests that competing reactions at acidic pH determine the production of nitrating agents (NO) or other, more stable, oxides. Accordingly, it is shown in vitro that salivary nitrite yields higher steady state concentrations of NO (0.37 ± 0.01 μM) than sodium nitrite (0.12 ± 0.03 μM). Dietary-dependent reactions involving the production of nitrogen oxides should be further investigated as, in the context of occludin nitration, the consumption of green leafy vegetables (with high nitrate content), if able to modulate  barrier function, may have important implications in the context of   disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27892878>Inflammatory biomarkers are associated with ketosis in periparturient Holstein cows.</a></h1><p>Ketosis is a prevalent periparturient metabolic disorder and we hypothesize that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) infiltration may play a key role in its etiology. Study objectives were to characterize biomarkers of inflammation during the transition period in healthy and clinically diagnosed ketotic cows. Cows were retrospectively categorized into one of two groups: healthy and clinically diagnosed ketotic. Two data sets were utilized; the first dataset (Study A) was obtained as a subset of cows (n=16) enrolled in a larger experiment conducted at the Iowa State University Dairy utilizing Holstein cows (8 healthy; 8 ketotic), and the second dataset (Study B; 22 healthy; 22 ketotic) was obtained from a commercial farm. For both experiments, blood samples were collected prior to and following calving. Ketotic cows in both studies had reduced milk production compared to healthy cows (P<0.01). Post-calving, ketotic cows had increased serum amyloid A (4.2 and 1.8 fold in studies A and B, respectively; P=0.03 and P=0.04), haptoglobin (>6 fold and ~4 fold; P=0.04 and P=0.03), and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (66 and 45%; P<0.01 and P=0.02) compared with their healthy counterparts. Antepartum circulating LPS in ketotic cows was increased (2.3 fold; P=0.01) compared to healthy cows in Study B. In summary, increased biomarkers of inflammation appear to be closely associated with ketosis in transition dairy cows.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence for the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological interventions is weak. Mounting data indicate that the  microbiome interacts with the central nervous system and the immune system by neuroendocrine, neurotransmitter, neurotrophic and neuroinflammatory afferent and efferent pathways. There is growing evidence that the  microbiota influences weight regulation and psychopathology, such as anxiety and depression. This article reviews how the -brain interaction may impact the development and course of AN. A " ", characterized by antigens traversing the intestinal wall, was demonstrated in an animal model of AN, and could underlie the low-grade inflammation and increased risk of autoimmune diseases found in AN. Moreover, starvation has a substantial impact on the  microbiome, and diets used for re-nutrition based on animal products may support the growth of bacteria capable of triggering inflammation. As there is currently no empirically derived agreement on therapeutic re-nourishment in AN, this review discusses how consideration of -brain interactions may be important for treatment regarding the determination of target weight, rapidity of weight gain, refeeding methods and composition of the diet which might all be of importance to improve long-term outcome of one of the most chronic psychiatric disorders of adolescence.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504745>Are Postbiotics the Long Sought-After Solution for a  ?</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28455694>Increased Root Canal Endotoxin Levels are Associated with Chronic Apical Periodontitis, Increased Oxidative and Nitrosative Stress, Major Depression, Severity of Depression, and a Lowered Quality of Life.</a></h1><p>Evidence indicates that major depression is accompanied by increased translocation of  commensal Gram-negative bacteria ( ) and consequent activation of oxidative and nitrosative (O&NS) pathways. This present study examined the associations among chronic apical periodontitis (CAP), root canal endotoxin levels (lipopolysaccharides, LPS), O&NS pathways, depressive symptoms, and quality of life. Measurements included advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), lipid peroxides (LOOH), -sulfhydryl (SH) groups, total radical trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), and paraoxonase (PON)1 activity in participants with CAP, with and without depression, as well as healthy controls (no depression, no CAP). Root canal LPS levels were positively associated with CAP, clinical depression, severity of depression (as measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Beck Depression Inventory) and O&NS biomarkers, especially NOx and TRAP. CAP-related depression was accompanied by increased levels of NOx, LOOH, AOPP, and TRAP. In CAP participants, there was a strong correlation (r = 0.734, p < 0.001) between root canal LPS and the HDRS score. There were significant and positive associations between CAP or root canal endotoxin with the vegetative and physio-somatic symptoms of the HDRS as well as a significant inverse association between root canal endotoxin and quality of life with strong effects on psychological, environmental, and social domains. It is concluded that increased root canal LPS accompanying CAP may cause depression and a lowered quality of life, which may be partly explained by activated O&NS pathways, especially NOx thereby enhancing hypernitrosylation and thus neuroprogressive processes. Dental health and " teeth" may be intimately linked to the etiology and course of depression, while significantly impacting quality of life.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30764678>Agmatine as a potential therapeutic intervention in bipolar depression: the preclinical landscape.</a></h1><p>Present antidepressant treatments are only helpful in a quarter of patients with bipolar depression, and new strategies are warranted. Increasing evidence suggests that accelerated polyamine metabolism is associated with the pathophysiology of depression. Polyamines regulate stress responses, inflammation, and neuronal signaling in the central and enteric nervous system. Agmatine is a promising target of altered polyamine metabolism considering its unique ability to regulate intracellular polyamine content and neuroprotective effects. Areas covered: This review discusses the polyamine system and its relationship to the central and enteric nervous system, focusing on results from preclinical studies supporting the relationship between agmatine and the pathophysiology of depression. We also discussed the main mechanisms underlying the antidepressant and neuroprotective effects of agmatine. Expert opinion: Our review points out the possible relationship between polyamines and the pathophysiology of depression. It discusses the efficacy of agmatine in several models of depressive-like behaviour, and suggests that it may prove to be an efficacious adjunctive treatment in bipolar depression. Furthermore, it discusses a proposed pathway linking systemic inflammation, observed in a subset of bipolar disorder patients, to abnormal polyamine metabolism and associated changes in the epithelial  barrier and blood-brain barrier.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30667205>Effects of chronic exercise on  microbiota and intestinal barrier in human with type 2 diabetes.</a></h1><p>Intestinal dysbiosis has been proposed as a possible contributor of the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Indeed, commensal fungi and opportunistic bacteria stimulate the local immune system, altering intestinal permeability with consequent  , which in turn activates systemic inflammation responsible for insulin resistance. It is also well known that chronic exercise improves glucose control and diabetes-induced damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of chronic exercise on  flora composition and   in T2D stable patients.Thirty clinically stable patients with T2D were studied before and after a six months program of endurance, resistance and flexibility training. Metabolic and anthropometric evaluations were carried out.  flora and intestinal permeability were measured in stools by selective agar culture medium and molecular biology measurements of zonulin, which is the protein that modulates enterocyte tight junctions.Diabetes causes significant intestinal mycetes overgrowth, increased intestinal permeability and systemic low-grade inflammation. However, exercise improved glycemia, functional and anthropometric variables. Moreover, chronic exercise reduced intestinal mycetes overgrowth,  , and systemic inflammation. Interestingly, these variables are closely correlated.Exercise controls diabetes by also modifying intestinal microbiota composition and  barrier function. This data shows an additional mechanism of chronic exercise and suggests that improving  flora could be an important step in tailored therapies of T2D.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30071471>Pomegranate prevents binge alcohol-induced  leakiness and hepatic inflammation by suppressing oxidative and nitrative stress.</a></h1><p>Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major chronic liver disease worldwide and can range from simple steatosis, inflammation to fibrosis/cirrhosis possibly through   and systemic endotoxemia. We investigated whether pomegranate (POM) protects against binge alcohol-induced  leakiness, endotoxemia, and inflammatory liver damage. After POM pretreatment for 10 days, rats were exposed to 3 oral doses of binge alcohol (5 g/kg/dose) or dextrose (as control) at 12-h intervals. Binge alcohol exposure induced   with significantly elevated plasma endotoxin and inflammatory fatty liver by increasing the levels of oxidative and nitrative stress marker proteins such as ethanol-inducible CYP2E1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and nitrated proteins in the small intestine and liver. POM pretreatment significantly reduced the alcohol-induced  barrier dysfunction, plasma endotoxin and inflammatory liver disease by inhibiting the elevated oxidative and nitrative stress marker proteins. POM pretreatment significantly restored the levels of intestinal tight junction (TJ) proteins such as ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, and claundin-3 markedly diminished after alcohol-exposure. In addition, the levels of  adherent junction (AJ) proteins (e.g., β-catenin and E-cadherin) and desmosome plakoglobin along with associated protein α-tubulin were clearly decreased in binge alcohol-exposed rats but restored to basal levels in POM-pretreated rats. Immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analyses revealed that intestinal claudin-1 protein was nitrated and ubiquitinated in alcohol-exposed rats, whereas these modifications were significantly blocked by POM pretreatment. These results showed for the first time that POM can prevent alcohol-induced  leakiness and inflammatory liver injury by suppressing oxidative and nitrative stress.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29742432>IL-9 and Mast Cells Are Key Players of Candida albicans Commensalism and Pathogenesis in the .</a></h1><p>Candida albicans is implicated in intestinal diseases. Identifying host signatures that discriminate between the pathogenic versus commensal nature of this human commensal is clinically relevant. In the present study, we identify IL-9 and mast cells (MCs) as key players of Candida commensalism and pathogenicity. By inducing TGF-β in stromal MCs, IL-9 pivotally contributes to mucosal immune tolerance via the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase enzyme. However, Candida-driven IL-9 and mucosal MCs also contribute to barrier function loss, dissemination, and inflammation in experimental   models and are upregulated in patients with celiac disease. Inflammatory dysbiosis occurs with IL-9 and MC deficiency, indicating that the activity of IL-9 and MCs may go beyond host immunity to include regulation of the microbiota.

Due to the epidemic obesity, NAFLD is representing a global health issue and the leading cause of liver damage worldwide. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is closely related to insulin resistance (IR), adiposity and physical inactivity as well as genetic and epigenetic factors corroborate to the development and progression of hepatic steatosis and liver injury. Emerging evidence has outlined the implication of  microbiota and -derived endotoxins as actively contributors to NAFLD pathophysiology probably due to the tight anatomo-functional crosstalk between the  and the liver. Obesity, nutrition and environmental factors might alter intestinal permeability producing a favorable micro-environment for bacterial overgrowth, mucosal inflammation and translocation of both invasive pathogens and harmful byproducts, which, in turn, influence hepatic fat composition and exacerbated pro-inflammatory and fibrotic processes. To date, no therapeutic interventions are available for NAFLD prevention and management, except for modifications in lifestyle, diet and physical exercise even though they show discouraging results due to the poor compliance of patients. The premise of this review is to discuss the role of -liver axis in NAFLD and emphasize the beneficial effects of probiotics on  microbiota composition as a novel attractive therapeutic strategy to introduce in clinical practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29290146>Multifunctional Role of 35 Kilodalton Hyaluronan in Promoting Defense of the Intestinal Epithelium.</a></h1><p>Intestinal epithelium plays a critical role in host defense against orally acquired pathogens. Dysregulation of this protective barrier is a primary driver of inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's and ulcerative colitis) and also infant gastrointestinal infections. Previously, our lab reported that hyaluronan (HA) isolated from human milk induces the expression of the antimicrobial peptide β-defensin in vivo and protects against Salmonella Typhimurium infection of epithelial cells in vitro. In addition, we demonstrated that commercially available 35 kDa size HA induces the expression of β-defensin, upregulates the expression of tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and attenuates murine Citrobacter rodentium infection in vivo. In this current study, we report that HA35 remains largely intact and biologically active during transit through the digestive tract where it directly induces β-defensin expression upon epithelial cell contact. We also demonstrate HA35 abrogation of murine Salmonella Typhimurium infection as well as downregulation of  tight junction protein claudin-2 expression. Taken together, we propose a dual role for HA in host innate immune defense at the epithelial cell surface, acting to induce antimicrobial peptide production and also block pathogen-induced  .

Reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide, and reactive nitrogen species, such as nitric oxide and peroxynitrite, play essential roles in normal brain capillary endothelial cell functioning; however, chronically elevated oxidative and nitrosative stress can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and damage to the blood-brain barrier. Activated microglia, redox control of which is mediated by nitric oxide synthases and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases, secrete neurotoxic molecules such as reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, prostaglandin, cyclooxygenase-2, quinolinic acid, several chemokines (including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1], C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 [CXCL-1] and macrophage inflammatory protein 1α [MIP-1α]) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, which can exert a detrimental effect on blood-brain barrier integrity and function. Similarly, reactive astrocytes produce neurotoxic molecules such as prostaglandin E2 and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can cause a ' brain'.Chronic inflammatory and oxidative and nitrosative stress is associated with the development of a ' '. The following evidence-based approaches, which address the   and blood-brain barrier dysfunction, are suggested as potential therapeutic interventions for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders: melatonin, statins, probiotics containing Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, N-acetylcysteine, and prebiotics containing fructo-oligosaccharides and galacto-oligosaccharides.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30413188>Microbiota dysbiosis and barrier dysfunction in inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancers: exploring a common ground hypothesis.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multifactorial disease which arises as a result of the interaction of genetic, environmental, barrier and microbial factors leading to chronic inflammation in the intestine. Patients with IBD had a higher risk of developing colorectal carcinoma (CRC), of which the subset was classified as colitis-associated cancers. Genetic polymorphism of innate immune receptors had long been considered a major risk factor for IBD, and the mutations were also recently observed in CRC. Altered microbial composition (termed microbiota dybiosis) and dysfunctional  barrier manifested by epithelial hyperpermeability and high amount of mucosa-associated bacteria were observed in IBD and CRC patients. The findings suggested that aberrant immune responses to penetrating commensal microbes may play key roles in fueling disease progression. Accumulative evidence demonstrated that mucosa-associated bacteria harbored colitogenic and protumoral properties in experimental models, supporting an active role of bacteria as pathobionts (commensal-derived opportunistic pathogens). Nevertheless, the host factors involved in bacterial dysbiosis and conversion mechanisms from lumen-dwelling commensals to mucosal pathobionts remain unclear. Based on the observation of  leakiness in patients and the evidence of epithelial hyperpermeability prior to the onset of mucosal histopathology in colitic animals, it was postulated that the epithelial barrier dysfunction associated with mucosal enrichment of specific bacterial strains may predispose the shift to disease-associated microbiota. The speculation of   as an initiating factor for microbiota dysbiosis that eventually led to pathological consequences was proposed as the "common ground hypothesis", which will be highlighted in this review. Overall, the understanding of the core interplay between  microbiota and epithelial barriers at early subclinical phases will shed light to novel therapeutic strategies to manage chronic inflammatory disorders and colitis-associated cancers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29922669>Increased Intestinal Permeability and Decreased Barrier Function: Does It Really Influence the Risk of Inflammation?</a></h1><p>Increased intestinal permeability due to barrier dysfunction is supposed to cause microbial translocation which may induce low-grade inflammation in various diseases. However, this series of events has not been comprehensively evaluated yet.Intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction and increased permeability have been described in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver cirrhosis, acute pancreatitis, primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), type 1 and type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure (CHF), depression, and other diseases. Most clinical reports used either permeability assays of challenge tests or measurement of circulating bacterial markers like endotoxin for assessment of 'the  '. The intestinal permeability assessed by the challenge tests has often been related to the changes of tight junction proteins in the epithelium or circulating endotoxin levels. In patients with IBD, alcoholic liver disease, NASH, liver cirrhosis, PBC, obstructive jaundice, severe acute pancreatitis, and CHF, endotoxemia and proinflammatory cytokinemia have been found in addition to increased permeability. In the serum of patients with IBS and depression, antiflagellin antibodies and antilipid A antibodies were detected, respectively, together with increased permeability and proinflammatory cytokinemia. The site of infection, which is localized to the intestine in IBD and IBS, includes various extraintestinal organs in other diseases. The relation of  dysbiosis to intestinal barrier dysfunction has gradually been clarified.Although no direct cause-and-effect relationship has been confirmed, all clinical and experimental data suggest the importance of intestinal hyperpermeability in the inflammatory changes of various diseases. Increased intestinal permeability is a new target for disease prevention and therapy. Considering the close relationship of 'the  ' and  dysbiosis to the major diseases, we can conclude that meticulous dietetic and probiotic approaches to recover healthy microbiota have the potential to make a breakthrough in the management of these diseases tomorrow.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27623987>NMR-based urinary profiling of lactulose/mannitol ratio used to assess the altered intestinal permeability in acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) patients.</a></h1><p>The article presents a simplified NMR-based protocol for urinary profiling of lactulose/mannitol ratio (LMR) and demonstrates here its utility to assess increased intestinal permeability (IP) in patients with acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). ACLF is a serious clinical complication associated with chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). The major risk factor in its development is increased IP (' '), which has been linked to disease progression and to infectious complications. However, IP has seldom been investigated in patients with ACLF, even though patients frequently report gastrointestinal disorders and associated complications. To this end, we first optimized the NMR-based targeted profiling of urinary metabolites (i.e. actulose, mannitol, and creatinine) and subsequently used this resulted protocol (a) first to evaluate the altered IP in ACLF patients and then (b) to explore its utility for monitoring the treatment response in these patients. The normal profiles were obtained for 7 age and sex matched healthy volunteers. The results revealed that the urinary LMR excretion was significantly higher in ACLF patients compared to normal controls (median ~0.7, range (0.12-2.84), vs median ~0.11, range (0.02-0.28), p < 0.001) suggesting that the ACLF patients' exhibit altered IP. However, the LMR excretion in six clinically improved follow-up ACLF patients was comparable to normal controls indicating restored IP after the treatment. The protocol-as demonstrated here with ACLF-is equally applicable for evaluating IP or mucosal barrier function in other intestinal disorders with reasonable sensitivity and specificity, highlighting its general utility.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30085297>Sodium butyrate ameliorates insulin resistance and renal failure in CKD rats by modulating intestinal permeability and mucin expression.</a></h1><p>The associated increase in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels and uremic toxins in chronic kidney disease (CKD) has shifted the way we focus on intestinal microbiota. This study shows that a disruption of the intestinal barrier in CKD promotes leakage of LPS from the , subsequently decreasing insulin sensitivity. Butyrate treatment improved the intestinal barrier function by increasing colonic mucin and tight junction (TJ) proteins. This modulation further ameliorated metabolic functions such as insulin intolerance and improved renal function.Renal failure was induced by 5/6th nephrectomy (Nx) in rats. A group of Nx and control rats received sodium butyrate in drinking water. The Nx groups were compared with sham-operated controls.The Nx rats had significant increases in serum creatinine, urea and proteinuria. These animals had impaired glucose and insulin tolerance and increased gluconeogenesis, which corresponded with decreased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion. The Nx animals suffered significant loss of intestinal TJ proteins, colonic mucin and mucin 2 protein. This was associated with a significant increase in circulating LPS, suggesting a   phenomenon. 5'adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, known to modulate epithelial TJs and glucose metabolism, was significantly reduced in the intestine of the Nx group. Anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 10, anti-bacterial peptide and cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide were also lowered in the Nx cohort. Butyrate treatment increased AMPK phosphorylation, improved renal function and controlled hyperglycemia.Butyrate improves AMPK phosphorylation, increases GLP-1 secretion and promotes colonic mucin and TJ proteins, which strengthen the  wall. This decreases LPS leakage and inflammation. Taken together, butyrate improves metabolic parameters such as insulin resistance and markers of renal failure in CKD animals.© The Author(s) 2018.

Such a compromised intestinal barrier is the main factor underlying the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, but also commonly occurs in various systemic diseases such as viral infections and metabolic syndrome. The non-pathogenic yeast  CNCM I-745 has demonstrated its effectiveness as a probiotic in the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated, infectious and functional diarrhea. Via multiple mechanisms of action implicated in intestinal barrier function,  has beneficial effects on altered intestinal microbiota and epithelial barrier defects in different pathologies. The well-studied probiotic yeast  plays a crucial role in the preservation and/or restoration of intestinal barrier function in multiple disorders. This could be of major interest in diseases characterized by alterations in intestinal barrier function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29869736>Composition and richness of the serum microbiome differ by age and link to systemic inflammation.</a></h1><p>Advanced age has been associated with alterations to the microbiome within the intestinal tract as well as intestinal permeability (i.e., " "). Prior studies suggest that intestinal permeability may contribute to increases in systemic inflammation-an aging hallmark-possibly via microorganisms entering the circulation. Yet, no studies exist describing the state of the circulating microbiome among older persons. To compare microbiota profiles in serum between healthy young (20-35 years, n = 24) and older adults (60-75 years, n = 24) as well as associations between differential microbial populations and prominent indices of age-related inflammation. Unweighted Unifrac analysis, a measure of β-diversity, revealed that microbial communities clustered differently between young and older adults. Several measures of α-diversity, including chao1 (p = 0.001), observed species (p = 0.001), and phylogenetic diversity (p = 0.002) differed between young and older adults. After correction for false discovery rate (FDR), age groups differed (all p values ≤ 0.016) in the relative abundance of the phyla Bacteroidetes, SR1, Spirochaetes, Bacteria_Other, TM7, and Tenericutes. Significant positive correlations (p values ≤ 0.017 after FDR correction) were observed between IGF1 and Bacteroidetes (ρ = 0.380), Spirochaetes (ρ = 0.528), SR1 (ρ = 0.410), and TM7 (ρ = 0.399). Significant inverse correlations were observed for IL6 with Bacteroidetes (ρ = - 0.398) and TM7 (ρ = - 0.423), as well as for TNFα with Bacteroidetes (ρ = - 0.344). Similar findings were observed at the class taxon. These data are the first to demonstrate that the richness and composition of the serum microbiome differ between young and older adults and that these factors are linked to indices of age-related inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31530137>Additional  administration enhances the severity of dextran sulfate solution induced colitis mouse model through  -enhanced systemic inflammation and -dysbiosis but attenuated by  L34.</a></h1><p> is abundant in the human  mycobiota but this species does not colonize the mouse gastrointestinal tract.  administration in dextran-sulfate solution (DSS) induced-colitis mouse model (DSS+) might resemble more to human condition, therefore, a DSS colitis model with  administration was studied; first, to test the influence of fungi in DSS model and second, to test the efficacy of  L34. We demonstrated serum (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG) elevation in patients with IBD and endoscopic moderate colitis in clinical remission, supporting the possible influence of  fungi toward IBD in human. Then, in mouse model,  gavage was found to worsen the DSS model indicated by higher mortality rate, more severe colon histology and enhanced -leakage (FITC-dextran assay, endotoxemia, serum BG and blood bacterial burdens) but did not affect weight loss and diarrhea. DSS+ induced higher pro-inflammatory cytokines both in blood and in intestinal tissue. Worsened systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in DSS+ compared with DSS alone was possibly due to the more severe translocation of LPS, BG and bacteria (not fungemia) from  into systemic circulation. Interestingly, bacteremia from  was more frequently isolated from DSS+ than DSS alone. In parallel,  was also isolated from fecal culture in most of the mice in DSS+ group supported by prominent  in fecal microbioata analysis. However,  L34 attenuated both DSS+ and DSS model through the attenuation of  local inflammation (cytokines and histology), -leakage severity, fecal dysbiosis (culture method and microbiome analysis) and systemic inflammation (serum cytokines). In conclusion,   in DSS model induced fecal bacterial dysbiosis and enhanced - induced bacteremia. Probiotic treatment strategy aiming to reduce -fungi and fecal dysbiosis could attenuate disease severity. Investigation on  fungi in patients with IBD is highly interesting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29751049>Increased butyrate priming in the  stalls microbiome associated-gastrointestinal inflammation and hepatic metabolic reprogramming in a mouse model of Gulf War Illness.</a></h1><p>Most of the associated pathologies in Gulf War Illness (GWI) have been ascribed to chemical and pharmaceutical exposures during the war. Since an increased number of veterans complain of gastrointestinal (GI), neuroinflammatory and metabolic complications as they age and there are limited options for a cure, the present study was focused to assess the role of butyrate, a short chain fatty acid for attenuating GWI-associated GI and metabolic complications. Results in a GWI-mouse model of permethrin and pyridostigmine bromide (PB) exposure showed that oral butyrate restored  homeostasis and increased GPR109A receptor copies in the small intestine (SI). Claudin-2, a protein shown to be upregulated in conditions of   was significantly decreased following butyrate administration. Butyrate decreased TLR4 and TLR5 expressions in the liver concomitant to a decrease in TLR4 activation. GW-chemical exposure showed no clinical signs of liver disease but a significant alteration of metabolic markers such as SREBP1c, PPAR-α, and PFK was evident. Liver markers for lipogenesis and carbohydrate metabolism that were significantly upregulated following GW chemical exposure were attenuated by butyrate priming in vivo and in human primary hepatocytes. Further, Glucose transporter Glut-4 that was shown to be elevated following liver complications were significantly decreased in these mice after butyrate administration. Finally, use of TLR4 KO mice completely attenuated the liver metabolic changes suggesting the central role of these receptors in the GWI pathology. In conclusion, we report a butyrate specific mechanistic approach to identify and treat increased metabolic abnormalities in GWI veterans with systemic inflammation, chronic fatigue, GI disturbances, metabolic complications and weight gain.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to investigate whether circulating markers of bacterial translocation were associated with survival in a Norwegian primary sclerosing cholangitis cohort.Serum levels of zonulin, intestinal fatty acid binding protein, soluble CD14, lipopolysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein were measured in 166 primary sclerosing cholangitis patients and 100 healthy controls.Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and soluble CD14 were elevated in primary sclerosing cholangitis compared with healthy controls (median 13 662 vs 12 339 ng/mL, P = 0.010 and 1657 vs 1196 ng/mL, P < 0.001, respectively). High soluble CD14 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (values >optimal cut-off using receiver operating characteristics) were associated with reduced liver transplantation-free survival (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). The concentration of soluble CD14 was higher in patients with hepatobiliary cancer compared to other primary sclerosing cholangitis patients and healthy controls. Zonulin was lower in primary sclerosing cholangitis than controls, but when excluding primary sclerosing cholangitis patients with increased prothrombin time zonulin concentrations were similar in primary sclerosing cholangitis and healthy controls. Concomitant inflammatory bowel disease did not influence the results, while inflammatory bowel disease patients without primary sclerosing cholangitis (n = 40) had lower concentration of soluble CD14. In multivariable Cox regression, high soluble CD14 and high lipopolysaccharide-binding protein were associated with transplantation-free survival, independent from Mayo risk score (HR: 2.26 [95% CI: 1.15-4.43], P = 0.018 and HR: 2.00 [95% CI: 1.17-3.43], P = 0.011, respectively).Primary sclerosing cholangitis patients show increased levels of circulating markers of bacterial translocation. High levels are associated with poor prognosis measured by transplantation-free survival, indicating that ongoing  leakage could have clinical impact in primary sclerosing cholangitis.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Serum concentrations of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6, zonulin (a marker for  ), and high-mobility group box protein (HMGB1, a nuclear protein triggering inflammation) were measured. Correlations of serum levels of zonulin and HMGB1 with strength of plantar flexor muscles and number of steps taken per day were analyzed.Serum concentration of zonulin and HMGB1 were 22% (P = .005) and 16% (P = .010) higher in the older versus young adults. Serum zonulin was positively associated with concentrations of TNF-α (r = 0.357, P = .032) and IL-6 (r = 0.345, P = .043). Importantly, both zonulin and HMGB1 were negatively correlated with skeletal muscle strength (zonulin: r = -0.332, P = .048; HMGB1: r = -0.383, P = .023), and habitual physical activity (zonulin: r = -0.410, P = .016; HMGB1: r = -0.483, P = .004).Serum zonulin was associated with both systemic inflammation and 2 key indices of physical frailty.

Postpartum depression is predicted by end of term prenatal depressive symptoms whilst a lifetime history of mood disorders appears to increase the risk for both prenatal and postpartum depression. This review provides a critical appraisal of available evidence linking IO&NS pathways to prenatal and postpartum depression. The electronic databases Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus were sources for this narrative review focusing on keywords, including perinatal depression, (auto)immune, inflammation, oxidative, nitric oxide, nitrosative, tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), kynurenine,   and microbiome. Prenatal depressive symptoms are associated with exaggerated pregnancy-specific changes in IO&NS pathways, including increased C-reactive protein, advanced oxidation protein products and nitric oxide metabolites, lowered antioxidant levels, such as zinc, as well as lowered regulatory IgM-mediated autoimmune responses. The latter pathways coupled with lowered levels of endogenous anti-inflammatory compounds, including ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, may also underpin the pathophysiology of postpartum depression. Although increased bacterial translocation, lipid peroxidation and TRYCAT pathway activation play a role in mood disorders, similar changes do not appear to be relevant in perinatal depression. Some IO&NS biomarker characteristics of mood disorders are found in prenatal depression indicating that these pathways partly contribute to the association of a lifetime history of mood disorders and perinatal depression. However, available evidence suggests that some IO&NS pathways differ significantly between perinatal depression and mood disorders in general. This review provides a new IO&NS model of prenatal and postpartum depression.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Alterations in the relative numbers of  microbiota may contribute to such a disruption in normal bacterial diversity. It is assumed that this process may be adequately mirrored for the purpose of the current paper by modeling the dynamic shifts in the numbers of three bacterial species, namely Clostridium, Desulfovibrio, and Bifidobacterium. Such imbalances in the  microbiome are thought to promote the development of increased  permeability (the so-called " ") which in turn is a potential risk factor for the development of ASD.We constructed a mathematical model using 2-D Cellular Automata to simulate the growth rates and interactions of three bacterial species, namely Bifidobacterium, Clostridium and Desulfovibrio, with each other and with available nutrients in the , and particularly following the introduction of lysozyme into the .It was observed from the modeled simulation that increasing or decreasing the population of Clostridium in the  produces key shifts in the  microbiome which could potentially increase or decrease the risk of ASD.Simulations using our cellular automaton model suggest that it could be useful in predicting the effects produced by alterations to key components of the  microbiome. In particular, the model demonstrated that the introduction of lysozyme in the  results in steep reductions in Clostridium growth rate, which in turn could potentially alter the  microbiome population in such a way as to significantly reduce the risk of developing ASD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we evaluated the effects of a combination of green tea extract (GTE) with isomalto-oligosaccharide (IMOs) on HFD-induced alterations in mice. Male Swiss albino mice were fed with HFD (58% fat kcal) for 12 weeks. Systemic adiposity,  derangement parameters and V3-V4 region based 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing, ectopic fat deposition, liver metabolome analysis, systemic and tissue inflammation, and energy homeostasis markers along with gene expression analysis in multiple tissues were done in mice supplemented with GTE, IMOs or their combination. The combination of GTE and IMOs effectively prevented HFD-induced adiposity and lipid accumulation in liver and muscle while normalizing fasting blood glucose, insulin, glucagon, and leptin levels. Co-administration of GTE with IMOs effectively modulated liver metabolome associated with lipid metabolism. It also prevented   phenotype and HFD-induced increase in circulating lipopolysaccharides and pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. resistin, TNF-α, and IL-1β) and reduction in anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. adiponectin and IL-6). Gene expression analysis across multiple tissues further supported these functional outcomes. Most importantly, this combination improved beneficial  microbiota (Lactobacillus sp., Bifidobacteria, Akkermansia muciniphila, Roseburia spp.) abundances, restored Firmicutes/Bacteriodetes and improved Prevotella/Bacteroides proportions. In particular, a combination of these two agents has shown improved beneficial effects on multiple parameters studied. Data presented herein suggests that strategically chosen food components might be highly effective in the prevention of HFD-induced alterations and may further be developed as functional foods.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite current treatments, the prevalence of asthma has increased markedly over decades. According to the theories proposed to explain the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases in integrative medicine,   syndrome is a phenomenon of increased intestinal permeability due to the disruption of tight junctions and is thought to be related to many chronic diseases, such as food intolerance, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and other autoimmune disease. One of the classical approaches used by integrative physicians to treat   syndrome is to repair intestinal permeability to prevent allergic cascade. Due to several mechanisms that have been mentioned in the protective effects of plant gums and plantain family seeds on the intestinal epithelium, we can propose an effective management for   syndrome to treat asthma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26913756>Evaluation of Intestinal Function in Children With Autism and Gastrointestinal Symptoms.</a></h1><p>Alterations in intestinal function, often characterized as a " ," have been attributed to children who are on the autism spectrum. Disaccharidase activity, intestinal inflammation, and permeability were analyzed in 61 children with autism and 50 nonautistic individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms.All patients had duodenal biopsies assayed for lactase, sucrase, maltase, and palatinase activity. Intestinal permeability was evaluated by rhamnose/lactulose test and measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Intestinal inflammation was evaluated by fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and histology.Some children with autism had mild levels of mucosal inflammation on intestinal biopsy. Disaccharidase activity was not different in autistic and nonautistic individuals. Fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin were similar in both groups. Differences between lactulose and rhamnose recovery and lactulose/rhamnose ratio in urine were not statistically different in patients with and without autism.The present study supports the observation that children with autism who have symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders have objective findings similar to children without autism. Neither noninvasive testing nor endoscopic findings identify gastrointestinal pathology specific to autism, but may be of benefit in identifying children with autism who have atypical symptoms.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30090100>Intestinal Dysbiosis in Autoimmune Diabetes Is Correlated With Poor Glycemic Control and Increased Interleukin-6: A Pilot Study.</a></h1><p>Intestinal dysbiosis associated with immunological deregulation,  , bacterial translocation, and systemic inflammation has been associated with autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes (T1D). The aim of this study was to investigate the intestinal dysbiosis in T1D patients and correlate these results with clinical parameters and cytokines. The present study was approved by the Barretos Cancer Hospital (Process number 903/2014), and all participants have signed the informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and answered a questionnaire about dietary habits. Stool samples were used for bacterial 16S sequencing by MiSeq Illumina platform. IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, TNF, and IFN-γ plasma concentrations were determined by cytometric bead arrays. The Pearson's chi-square, Mann-Whitney and Spearman correlation were used for statistical analyses. Alpha and beta diversities were conducted by using an annotated observed taxonomic units table. This study included 20 patients and 28 controls, and we found significant differences ( < 0.05) among consumption of vegetables, proteins, milk and derivatives, spicy food, and canned food when we compare patients and controls. We detected intestinal dysbiosis in T1D patients when we performed the beta diversity analysis ( = 0.01). The prevalent species found in patients' stool were the Gram-negatives , and . The inflammatory interleukin-6 was significantly increased ( = 0.017) in patients' plasma. Furthermore, we showed correlation among patients with poor glycemic control, represented by high levels of HbA1 percentages and Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillales, and  relative abundances. We concluded that there are different  microbiota profiles between T1D patients and healthy controls. The prevalent Gram-negative species in T1D patients could be involved in the  , bacterial translocation, and poor glycemic control. However, additional studies, with larger cohorts, are required to determine a "signature" of the intestinal microbiota in T1D patients in the Brazilian population.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30745566>Macrophage-dependent neutrophil recruitment is impaired under conditions of increased intestinal permeability in JAM-A-deficient mice.</a></h1><p>Junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on leukocytes, endothelia, and epithelia that regulates biological processes including barrier function and immune responses. While JAM-A has been reported to facilitate tissue infiltration of leukocytes under inflammatory conditions, the contributions of leukocyte-expressed JAM-A in vivo remain unresolved. We investigated the role of leukocyte-expressed JAM-A in acute peritonitis induced by zymosan, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or TNFα using mice with selective loss of JAM-A in myelomonocytic cells (LysM-Cre;Jam-a). Surprisingly, in LysM-Cre;Jam-a mice, loss of JAM-A did not affect neutrophil (PMN) recruitment into the peritoneum in response to zymosan, LPS, or TNFα although it was significantly reduced in Jam-a mice. In parallel, Jam-a peritoneal macrophages exhibited diminished CXCL1 chemokine production and decreased activation of NF-kB, whereas those from LysM-Cre;Jam-a mice were unaffected. Using Villin-Cre;Jam-a mice, targeted loss of JAM-A on intestinal epithelial cells resulted in increased intestinal permeability along with reduced peritoneal PMN migration as well as lower levels of CXCL1 and active NF-kB similar to that observed in Jam-a animals. Interestingly, in germ-free Villin-Cre;Jam-a mice, PMN recruitment was unaffected suggesting dependence on  microbiota.

Factors influencing pathogenesis, including a  intestinal mucosal barrier, an aberrant  microbiota composition, and altered immune responsiveness, offer potential targets for prevention and/or treatment of T1D through nutritional or pharmacologic means. In this review, nutritional approaches during early life in order to protect against T1D development have been discussed. The critical role of tolerogenic dendritic cells in central and peripheral tolerance has been emphasized. In addition, since the  microbiota affects the development of T1D through short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-dependent mechanisms, we hypothesize that nutritional intervention boosting SCFA production may be used as a novel prevention strategy. Current retrospective evidence has suggested that exclusive and prolonged breastfeeding might play a protective role against the development of T1D. The beneficial properties of human milk are possibly attributed to its bioactive components such as unique immune-modulatory components human milk oligosaccharides and metabolites derived thereof, including SCFAs. These components might play a key role in healthy immune development and creating a fit and resilient immune system in early and later life.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29251668>Perioperative Fluid Accumulation Impairs Intestinal Contractility to a Similar Extent as Peritonitis and Endotoxemia.</a></h1><p>Perioperative resuscitation with large amounts of fluid may cause tissue edema, especially in the , and thereby impairing its functions. This is especially relevant in sepsis where capillaries become  and fluid rapidly escapes to the pericapillary tissue. We assessed the effects of endotoxemia and peritonitis, and the use of high and moderate volume fluid resuscitation on jejunal contractility. We hypothesized that both endotoxemia and peritonitis impair jejunum contractility and relaxation, and that this effect is aggravated in peritonitis and with high fluid administration.Pigs were randomized to endotoxin (n = 16), peritonitis (n = 16), or sham operation (n = 16), and either high (20 mL/kg/h) or moderate volume (10 mL/kg/h) fluid resuscitation for 24 h or until death. At the end of the experiment, jejunal contractility and relaxation were measured in vitro using acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside reactivity, and the effect of nitric oxide synthase inhibition (NOS-I) was assessed.Mortality in the respective groups was 88% (peritonitis high), 75% (endotoxemia high), 50% (peritonitis moderate), 13% (endotoxemia moderate and sham operation high), and 0% (sham operation moderate volume resuscitation). Although  perfusion was preserved in all groups, jejunal contractility was impaired in the two peritonitis and two endotoxemia groups, and similarly also in the sham operation group treated with high but not with moderate volume fluid resuscitation (model-fluid-contraction-interaction, P = 0.036; maximal contractility 136 ± 28% [average of both peritonitis, both endotoxemia and sham operation high-volume groups) vs. 170 ± 74% of baseline [sham operation moderate-volume group]). NOS-I reduced contractility (contraction-inhibition-interaction, P = 0.011) without significant differences between groups and relaxation was affected neither by peritonitis and endotoxemia nor by the fluid regimen.Intestinal contractility is similarly impaired during peritonitis and during endotoxemia. Moreover, perioperative high-volume fluid resuscitation in sham-operated animals also decreases intestinal contractility.

In this study we demonstrated intestinal barrier disruption and aberrant mucosal immunity in 5/6 nephrectomized mice and the effect of probiotics on chronic kidney disease (CKD).CKD was induced in 6-week-old mice by 5/6 nephrectomy. They were fed a lactobacilli mixture for 8 weeks. Serum, urine and stool samples were collected for renal function assessments and  microbiome analyses.  permeability, colon heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and colon epithelial integrity were evaluated and cytokine levels in colon and kidney were measured. Colon leukocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry and bone marrow-derived cells were cocultured with lactobacilli mixture.In CKD mice, ' ' was accompanied by decreased colon HSP70 and claudin-1 expression, whereas it increased pore-forming claudin-2 expression and apoptosis. Although the percentage of regulatory T cells did not differ between CKD and control mice, cytokine expression and the ratio of CX3CR1intermediate:CX3CR1high pro-inflammatory/resident macrophages increased in the colon of CKD mice. Orally administered lactobacilli partially mitigated the CKD-induced ' '; restored colon epithelial HSP70, claudin-1 and claudin-2 expression and decreased apoptosis. Probiotic treatment also restored the CX3CR1intermediate:CX3CR1high macrophage ratio and increased circular dichroism (CD)103+CD11c+ regulatory dendritic cells in the colon. These changes suppressed systemic inflammation and kidney fibrosis.Our results suggest that intestinal dysbiosis-associated  barrier disruption and aberrant mucosal immunity are important for the systemic inflammation and progressive fibrosis of CKD.

However, the involvement of detrimental humoral mediators in the pathogenesis of cardiorenal syndrome is still controversial. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a hepatic metabolic product of trimethylamine generated from dietary phosphatidylcholine or carnitine derived by the  microbiota, has been linked directly with progression of cardiovascular disease and renal dysfunction. Thus, targeting TMAO may be a novel strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease.Linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase C agonist, was administered to adenine-induced renal failure (RF) mice and changes in renal function and levels of -derived uremic toxins, as well as the  microbiota community, were analyzed using metabolomic and metagenomic methods to reveal its cardiorenal effect.Linaclotide decreased the plasma levels of TMAO at a clinically used low dose of 10 μg/kg in the adenine-induced RF mouse model. At a high concentration of 100 μg/kg, linaclotide clearly improved renal function and reduced the levels of various uremic toxins. A reduction in TMAO levels following linaclotide treatment was also observed in a choline-fed pro-atherosclerotic model. Linaclotide ameliorated renal inflammation and fibrosis and cardiac fibrosis, as well as decreased the expression of collagen I, transforming growth factor-β, galectin-3 (Gal-3) and ST2 genes. Plasma levels of Gal-3 and ST2 were also reduced. Because exposure of cardiomyocytes to TMAO increased fibronectin expression, these data suggest that linaclotide reduced the levels of TMAO and various uremic toxins and may result in not only renal, but also cardiac, fibrosis. F4/80-positive macrophages were abundant in small intestinal crypts in RF mice, and this increased expression was decreased by linaclotide. Reduced colonic claudin-1 levels were also restored by linaclotide, suggesting that linaclotide ameliorated the ' ' in RF mice. Metagenomic analysis revealed that the microbial order Clostridiales could be responsible for the change in TMAO levels.Linaclotide reduced TMAO and uremic toxin levels and could be a powerful tool for the prevention and control of the cardiorenal syndrome by modification of the -cardio-renal axis.© The Author(s) 2019.

In the first part of this study, starting on day 9 of age, the growth performance of the birds fed 3 experimental diets in each phase of feeding (G/F: grower/finisher) was investigated. Three experimental diets were as follows: LP (170/150 g/kg CP) fortified with essential amino acids (EAA), standard protein (SP), (202/190 g/kg), and high protein (HP) (220/210 g/kg). LP and SP diets contained a similar level of EAA concentration, while the HP diet contained 10% above the Ross 308 specifications. Each diet was replicated 6 times (10 male birds per replicate). The second part investigated intestinal permeability (IP) and function on additional 72 birds. On days 14, 16, and 20, a total of 36 birds (12 birds per diet) were injected with dexamethasone (DEX) to induce  . Birds fed LP diets had lower body weight gain (BWG) and higher feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared with SP and HP diets in both grower and finisher phases of feeding. For the challenge part, DEX increased the FCR independent of diets. Diet and DEX interacted for BWG, whereby the effect of diets was only evident in sham-injected birds. Birds fed LP had a higher fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) concentration indicating a more permeable intestine compared to HP, but similar to SP. DEX increased FITC-d concentration in all dietary treatments. Birds fed LP had less ileal zonula occludens-2 (ZO-2) expression in comparison with SP, but not HP. DEX increased the expression of Claudin3 and ZO-2 and reduced Claudin1 (P < 0.05) and junctional adhesion molecule 2 in the ileum. Expression of ileal Na+-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) was upregulated in LP fed group. It is concluded that compared with SP, IP can be maintained in LP by supplementing EAA. However, when compared with HP, feeding birds with LP may lead to a higher IP. DEX had a profound independent effect on intestinal barrier function.© 2018 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27939537>Short communication: Early-lactation, but not mid-lactation, bovine lactoferrin preparation increases epithelial barrier integrity of Caco-2 cell layers.</a></h1><p>Bovine lactoferrin is an important milk protein with many health-promoting properties, including improving intestinal barrier integrity. Dysfunction of this barrier, commonly referred to as " ," has been linked to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. With some processing techniques, lactoferrin isolated from milk collected at the start of the milking season (early lactation) may have lower purity than that isolated from milk collected during the rest of the milking season (mid-lactation) and could result in differences in bioactivity based on the stage of lactation. We compared reversed-phase HPLC chromatographs of early-lactation and mid-lactation preparations and found that both had large chromatograph peaks at the time predicted for lactoferrin. The notable difference between the 2 chromatographs was a much larger peak in the early-lactation lactoferrin sample that was determined to be angiogenin. Angiogenin was first identified due to its ability to induce new blood vessel formation, but is now known to be involved in numerous physiological processes. Then, we compared the effects of early-lactation and mid-lactation lactoferrin preparations in 2 bioassays: trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), a measure of intestinal barrier integrity, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytokine secretion, a measure of immune-stimulatory properties. We found that early-lactation lactoferrin increased TEER across Caco-2 cell layers compared with control from 10 to 48 h, mid-lactation lactoferrin did not alter TEER. We also found that early-lactation lactoferrin reduced the amount of IL-8 produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (compared with those treated with control medium) to a greater extent than mid-lactation lactoferrin. A pro-inflammatory chemokine, IL-8 is also known to decrease barrier function. These results suggest that the decrease in IL-8 production in the presence of early-lactation lactoferrin may be the mechanism by which it increases TEER. The anti-inflammatory effect of early-lactation lactoferrin may be related to the presence of angiogenin, which is known to suppress inflammatory responses. This work indicates that products rich in angiogenin may have intestinal health benefits, and further work to investigate this is warranted.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

' ' has been found in intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases. However, functional evaluation of intestinal permeability is not widely used as a diagnostic marker, possibly owing to significant limitations of currently used permeability assays. There is an unmet need for development of a new, non-invasive test to assess intestinal function. What is the main finding and its importance? We show that an increased blood-to-stool ratio of the concentration of  bacteria-produced short-chain fatty acids may be used as a marker of  permeability. Our findings lay the groundwork for establishing a new, non-invasive, risk-free diagnostic tool in diseases associated with intestinal barrier malfunction, such as inflammatory bowel disease.Intestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are characterized by an impaired -blood barrier commonly referred to as ' '. Therefore, functional evaluation of the -blood barrier is a promising diagnostic marker. We hypothesized that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by  bacteria might serve as a marker in IBD. Animal experiments were performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats with acetic acid-induced colitis and in sham control animals. The -blood barrier permeability was determined by assessing the ratios of the following: (i) portal blood concentration of SCFAs (C ) to faecal concentration of SCFAs (C ); (ii) systemic blood concentration of SCFAs (C ) to faecal concentration of SCFAs (C ); and (iii) C and C of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran administered into the colon. As a clinical study, we evaluated C , C and the C /C ratio of SCFAs in six paediatric patients with IBD, assessed as mild/moderate/severe by the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and the Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) at the time of sample collection, and nine age-matched healthy control subjects. Rats with histologically confirmed IBD had significantly increased ratios of C /C and C /C for SCFAs. This was positively correlated with the plasma FITC-dextran concentration. Likewise, IBD patients showed a significantly higher C /C ratio for SCFAs, including acetic, valeric, isocaproic, caproic and propionic acids, in comparison to control subjects. In conclusion, in the rats and in paediatric patients with IBD we found an increased blood-to-stool ratio of SCFAs, suggesting an increased -to-blood penetration of SCFAs. These findings pave the way for a new, non-invasive diagnostic tool in IBD and other diseases accompanied by intestinal barrier malfunction.© 2019 The Authors.

A breach in the mucosal barrier, otherwise known as " ," is alleged to promote mucosal inflammation by intensifying immune activation. However, interaction between the luminal antigen and mucosal immune system is necessary to maintain mucosal homeostasis. Furthermore, manipulations leading to deregulated  permeability have resulted in susceptibility in mice to colitis as well as to creating adaptive immunity. These findings implicate a complex but dynamic association between mucosal permeability and immune homeostasis; however, they also emphasize that compromised  permeability alone may not be sufficient to induce colitis. Emerging evidence further supports the role(s) of proteins associated with the mucosal barrier in epithelial injury and repair: manipulations of associated proteins also modified epithelial differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Taken together, the role of  permeability and proteins associated in regulating mucosal inflammatory diseases appears to be more complex than previously thought. Herein, we review outcomes from recent mouse models where  permeability was altered by direct and indirect effects of manipulating mucosal barrier-associated proteins, to highlight the significance of mucosal permeability and the non-barrier-related roles of these proteins in regulating chronic mucosal inflammatory conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29195678>The interaction between smoking, alcohol and the  microbiome.</a></h1><p>The gastrointestinal microbiome is a complex echosystem that establishes a symbiotic, mutually beneficial relation with the host, being rather stable in health, but affected by age, drugs, diet, alcohol, and smoking. Alcohol and smoking contribute to changes in the stomach and affect H pylori-related disorders including the risk of gastric cancer. In the small intestine and in the colon alcohol causes depletion of bacteria with anti-inflammatory activity, eventually resulting in intestinal damage with " ". These changes contribute to hepatic damage in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease and have been associated with other disorders. Lactobacillus GG and A. muciniphila exert a protective effect in this setting. Smoking leads to modifications of the  microbiome linked with a protective effect toward ulcerative colitis and deleterious for Crohn's disease. The exact cause-effect relation between alcohol and smoking and changes of the gastrointestinal microbiome needs further exploration with high throughput methodologies, and controlled studies are necessary to define the role of microbiome modulation on the immune response and systemic activation of pro-inflammatory pathways.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This review focuses on specific alterations of  microbiota mostly observed in autistic patients. Particularly, the mechanisms through which such alterations may trigger the production of the bacterial metabolites, or   in autistic people are described. Various altered metabolite levels were observed in the blood and urine of autistic children, many of which were of bacterial origin such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), indoles and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). A less integrative -blood-barrier is abundant in autistic individuals. This explains the leakage of bacterial metabolites into the patients, triggering new body responses or an altered metabolism. Some other co-occurring symptoms such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress in cells, altered tight junctions in the blood-brain barrier and structural changes in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and cerebellum were also detected. Moreover, this paper suggests that ASD is associated with an unbalanced  microbiota (dysbiosis). Although the cause-effect relationship between ASD and  microbiota is not yet well established, the consumption of specific probiotics may represent a side-effect free tool to re-establish  homeostasis and promote  health. The diagnostic and therapeutic value of bacterial-derived compounds as new possible biomarkers, associated with perturbation in the phenylalanine metabolism, as well as potential therapeutic strategies will be discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27142301>Early-life enteric infections: relation between chronic systemic inflammation and poor cognition in children.</a></h1><p>The intestinal microbiota undergoes active remodeling in the first 6 to 18 months of life, during which time the characteristics of the adult microbiota are developed. This process is strongly influenced by the early diet and enteric pathogens. Enteric infections and malnutrition early in life may favor microbiota dysbiosis and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, resulting in intestinal barrier dysfunction and translocation of intestinal bacterial products, ultimately leading to low-grade, chronic, subclinical systemic inflammation. The  -derived low-grade systemic inflammation may have profound consequences on the -liver-brain axis, compromising normal growth, metabolism, and cognitive development. This review examines recent data suggesting that early-life enteric infections that lead to intestinal barrier disruption may shift the intestinal microbiota toward chronic systemic inflammation and subsequent impaired cognitive development.© The Author(s) 2016.

Dysfunction in each of these physiological components (dysbiosis,  , and inflammation) contributes in a mutually interdependent manner to IBD onset and exacerbation. Genetic and environmental risk factors lead to disruption of  homeostasis: genetic risks predominantly affect the immune system, environmental risks predominantly affect the microbiota, and both affect barrier function. Multiple genetic and environmental 'hits' are likely necessary to establish and exacerbate disease. Most conventional IBD therapies currently target only one component of the pathophysiological circuit, inflammation; however, many patients with IBD do not respond to immune-modulating therapies. Hope lies in new classes of therapies that target the microbiota and barrier function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27114435>The Effect of DA-6034 on Intestinal Permeability in an Indomethacin-Induced Small Intestinal Injury Model.</a></h1><p>DA-6034 has anti-inflammatory activities and exhibits cytoprotective effects in acute gastric injury models. However, explanations for the protective effects of DA-6034 on intestinal permeability are limited. This study sought to investigate the effect of DA-6034 on intestinal permeability in an indomethacin-induced small intestinal injury model and its protective effect against small intestinal injury.Rats in the treatment group received DA-6034 from days 0 to 2 and indomethacin from days 1 to 2. Rats in the control group received indomethacin from days 1 to 2. On the fourth day, the small intestines were examined to compare the severity of inflammation. Intestinal permeability was evaluated by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran. Western blotting was performed to confirm the association between DA-6034 and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway.The inflammation scores in the treatment group were lower than those in the control group, but the difference was statistically insignificant. Hemorrhagic lesions in the treatment group were broader than those in the control group, but the difference was statistically insignificant. Intestinal permeability was lower in the treatment group than in the control group. DA-6034 enhanced extracellular signal-regulated kinase expression, and intestinal permeability was negatively correlated with ERK expression.DA-6034 may decrease intestinal permeability in an indomethacin-induced intestinal injury model via the ERK pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30828551>Low Serum Levels of Zonulin in Patients with HCV-Infected Chronic Liver Diseases.</a></h1><p>The aim of the study was to assess the implication of Zonulin, a mediator protein synthesized by intestine and the liver,in patients with chronic liver diseases.Twenty-six patients with chronic liver diseases due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) were enrolled in this study. Out of total 26 patients, 17 were diagnosed as chronic hepatitis (CH) and 9 were patients with liver cirrhosis (LC). Twenty-four of these patients were infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the rest two by hepatitis B virus (HBV). The study was conducted at Saiseikai-Imabari Hospital, Imabari, Ehime, Japan. Serum levels of Zonulin along with different parameters of liver function test were measured in all patients and comparative analyses were accomplished.The serum levels of Zonulin were significantly lower in CH patients compared to controls (p<0.001). Also, the levels of Zonulin were significantly lower in patients with LC compared to CH and normal controls (p<0.001). Further analysis revealed that serum Zonulin was significantly lower in patients with LC having ascites than those without ascites (p <0.05). There was a significant correlation of serum levels of Zonulin with platelet count, cholinesterase, and albumin in patients with chronic liver diseases.Decreased levels of Zonulin may be related to impaired production of this mediator in the diseased liver. It will be tempting to assess the regulation of Zonulin in the liver, a production site of the mediator.LC: Liver cirrhosis, CH: Chronic hepatitis, HCV: Hepatitis C virus, HBV: Hepatitis B virus, LGS:   syndrome Akao T, Morita A, Onji M, Miyake T, Watanabe R, Uehara T, Kawasaki K, Miyaike J, Oomoto M.

The role of microbiota in increased intestinal permeability is under intensive investigation. Here, we studied alterations in the host and increased intestinal permeability as a direct effect of treatment with a bacteriophage cocktail. After 10 days of challenge, the rats showed weight loss, messy hair, and decreased activity.

The transmissibility of ethanol-induced liver disease has been demonstrated using faecal microbiota transfer in preclinical models. This technique has also led to improved survival in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, suggesting that changes in the composition and function of the  microbiota are causatively linked to alcohol-related liver disease. A major mechanism by which  microbiota influence the development of alcohol-related liver disease is through a  intestinal barrier. This permits translocation of viable bacteria and microbial products to the liver, where they induce and promote inflammation, as well as contribute to hepatocyte death and the fibrotic response. In addition,  dysbiosis is associated with changes in the metabolic function of the intestinal microbiota, bile acid composition and circulation, immune dysregulation during onset and progression of alcohol-related liver disease. Findings from preclinical and human studies will be used to demonstrate how alcohol causes intestinal pathology and contributes to alcohol-related liver disease and how the latter is self-perpetuating. Additionally, we summarise the effects of untargeted treatment approaches on the  microbiota, such as diet, probiotics, antibiotics and faecal microbial transplantation in alcohol-related liver disease. We further discuss how targeted approaches can restore intestinal homeostasis and improve alcohol-related liver disease. These approaches are likely to add to the therapeutic options for alcohol-related liver disease independently or in conjunction with steroids.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30667528>Microsomal Ethanol-Oxidizing System: Success Over 50 Years and an Encouraging Future.</a></h1><p>Fifty years ago, in 1968, the pioneering scientists Charles S. Lieber and Leonore M. DeCarli discovered the capacity for liver microsomes to oxidize ethanol (EtOH) and named it the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS), which revolutionized clinical and experimental alcohol research. The last 50 years of MEOS are now reviewed and highlighted. Since its discovery and as outlined in a plethora of studies, significant insight was gained regarding the fascinating nature of MEOS: (i) MEOS is distinct from alcohol dehydrogenase and catalase, representing a multienzyme complex with cytochrome P450 (CYP) and its preferred isoenzyme CYP 2E1, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, and phospholipids; (ii) it plays a significant role in alcohol metabolism at high alcohol concentrations and after induction due to prolonged alcohol use; (iii) hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals promote microsomal EtOH oxidation, assisted by phospholipid peroxides; (iv) new aspects focus on microsomal oxidative stress through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), with intermediates such as hydroxyethyl radical, ethoxy radical, acetyl radical, singlet radical, hydroxyl radical, alkoxyl radical, and peroxyl radical; (v) triggered by CYP 2E1, ROS are involved in the initiation and perpetuation of alcoholic liver injury, consequently shifting the previous nutrition-based concept to a clear molecular-based disease; (vi) intestinal CYP 2E1 induction and ROS are involved in endotoxemia,  , and intestinal microbiome modifications, together with hepatic CYP 2E1 and liver injury; (vii) circulating blood CYP 2E1 exosomes may be of diagnostic value; (viii) circadian rhythms provide high MEOS activities associated with significant alcohol metabolism and potential toxicity risks as a largely neglected topic; and (ix) a variety of genetic animal models are useful and have been applied elucidating mechanistic aspects of MEOS. In essence, MEOS along with its CYP 2E1 component currently explains several mechanistic steps leading to alcoholic liver injury and has a promising future in alcohol research.© 2019 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30347427>  biomarkers in depression and suicidal behavior.</a></h1><p>Inflammation is associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicidal behavior. According to the '  hypothesis', increased intestinal permeability may contribute to this relationship via bacterial translocation across enterocytes. We measured plasma levels of  permeability markers, in patients with a recent suicide attempt (rSA), MDD subjects with no history of a suicide attempt (nsMDD), and healthy controls (HC), and related these markers to symptom severity and inflammation.We enrolled rSA (n = 54), nsMDD (n = 13), and HC (n = 17). Zonulin, intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), soluble CD14, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were quantified in plasma. Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Suicide Assessment Scale (SUAS) were used for symptom assessments.The rSA group displayed higher I-FABP and lower zonulin levels compared with both the nsMDD and the HC groups (all P < 0.001). IL-6 correlated positively with I-FABP (r = 0.24, P < 0.05) and negatively with zonulin (r = -0.25, P < 0.05). In all subjects, I-FABP levels correlated positively with MADRS (r = 0.25, P < 0.05) and SUAS scores (r = 0.38, P < 0.001), and the latter correlation was significant also in the nsMDD group (r = 0.60, P < 0.05).The '  hypothesis' may improve our understanding of the link between inflammation and suicidal behavior.

While numerous studies have substantiated the health-restoring potentials for a restricted group of microbial species, the marketed extrapolation of a similar probiotic label to a large number of partially characterized microbial formulations seems biased. In particular, the individuals under neonatal stages and/or those with some clinical conditions including malignancies,  , diabetes mellitus, and post-organ transplant convalescence likely fail to reap the benefits of probiotics. Further exacerbating the conditions, some probiotic strains might take advantage of the weak immunity in these vulnerable groups and turn into opportunistic pathogens engendering life-threatening pneumonia, endocarditis, and sepsis. Moreover, the unregulated and rampant use of probiotics potentially carry the risk of plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance transfer to the  infectious pathogens. In this review, we discuss the safety perspectives of probiotics and their therapeutic interventions in certain at-risk population groups. The embodied arguments and hypotheses certainly will shed light on the fact why probiotic usage should be treated with caution.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The transmembrane protein claudin 2 (CLDN2) is a component of epithelial tight junctions (TJs). In the intestines of patients with IBDs, the expression of the pore-forming TJ protein CLDN2 is upregulated. Although CLDN2 is involved in these  barriers, whether it can be a target to enhance TJ integrity is unknown because a CLDN2-specific inhibitor has not been developed. Here, we used DNA immunization to generate a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that recognized an extracellular loop of CLDN2. Treatment of epithelial cell monolayers with the mAb increased barrier integrity. In addition, the anti-CLDN2 mAb attenuated the decrease in TJ integrity induced by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), and cotreatment of cells with anti-TNF- mAb and anti-CLDN2 mAb showed additive attenuating effects. These findings indicate that CLDN2 may be a target for enhancing TJ integrity, and CLDN2 binder may be an enhancer of mucosal barrier integrity and a potential therapeutic option for IBDs.Copyright © 2017 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p></html>
