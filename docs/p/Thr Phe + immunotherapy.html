<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16391196>Anticancer activity of targeted proapoptotic peptides.</a></h2><p>Tumor-induced angiogenesis can be targeted by RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptides, which bind to alpha(v)beta(3)-receptors upregulated on angiogenic endothelial cells. RGD-containing peptides are capable of inducing apoptosis through direct activation of procaspase-3 to caspase-3 in cells. Additionally, tumor cells overexpressing somatostatin receptors can be targeted by somatostatin analogs. Radiolabeled somatostatin analogs are successfully used to image and treat such tumors via receptor-targeted scintigraphy and therapy. We combined these 2 peptides, RGD and somatostatin, to synthesize a new hybrid peptide, RGD-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-octreotate (c(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Tyr-Asp)-Lys(DTPA)-D--c(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys--Cys)-). An earlier study showed that tumor-bearing rats had high receptor-specific uptake of RGD-(111)In-DTPA-octreotate in somatostatin receptor subtype 2-positive tissues and tumors. Furthermore, RGD-(111)In-DTPA-octreotate showed a pronounced tumoricidal effect, which is probably the result of increased apoptosis, as is shown by an increased caspase-3 activity after incubation with (111)In-labeled RGD-DTPA-octreotate in comparison with the 2 monopeptides (111)In-DTPA-RGD and (111)In-DTPA-Tyr(3)-octreotate. In this study, we evaluated the biodistributions of RGD-(111)In-DTPA-octreotate and (125)I-RGD-octreotate and investigated the caspase-3 activation of the unlabeled compound RGD-DTPA-octreotate in vitro.Biodistribution studies on tumor-bearing rats were performed with RGD-(111)In-DTPA-octreotate and (125)I-RGD-octreotate. The apoptotic activity, by activation of caspase-3 with RGD-DTPA-octreotate and RGD-octreotate, was examined using colorimetric and immunocytochemical assays.The radiolabeled compound, RGD-(111)In-DTPA-octreotate, showed high uptake and retention in the rats in which rat pancreatic CA20948 tumor had been implanted. A major drawback was high renal uptake. In vitro, the unlabeled peptide RGD-DTPA-octreotate induced a significant increase in caspase-3 levels in various cell lines in comparison with RGD and Tyr(3)-octreotate (P < 0.01). Caspase-3 activation was time dependent. To alter the elimination route, we examined the biodistribution of radioiodinated RGD-octreotate without DTPA [c(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Tyr-Asp)-D--c(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys--Cys)-], as a model of unlabeled RGD-octreotate, in tumor-bearing rats. (125)I-RGD-octreotate showed a much lower renal uptake than did RGD-(111)In-DTPA-octreotate. Furthermore, the affinity of RGD-octreotate increased in comparison with RGD-DTPA-octreotate (values of 1.4 x 10(-8) mol/L vs. 9.4 x 10(-8) mol/L, respectively, for inhibitory concentration of 50%). Finally, RGD-octreotate was still able to activate caspase-3, as was indicated with immunocytochemistry.Because of the high renal uptake, RGD-(111)In-DTPA-octreotate is unsuitable for radionuclide therapy. However, the unlabeled peptides, RGD-DTPA-octreotate and RGD-octreotate, also induced an increase in caspase-3 levels, indicating the therapeutic potential of this compound. Thus, the development of hybrid molecules can become a new approach in the treatment of cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15471839>Increased cell death after therapy with an Arg-Gly-Asp-linked somatostatin analog.</a></h2><p>Receptor-targeted scintigraphy and radionuclide therapy with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs are successfully applied for somatostatin receptor-positive tumors. The synergistic effects of an apoptosis-inducing factor, for example, the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif, can increase the radiotherapeutic efficacy of these peptides. Hence, the tumoricidal effects of the hybrid peptide RGD-diethylaminetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-Tyr3-octreotate (cyclic[c](Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Tyr-Asp)-Lys(DTPA)-D--c(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys--Cys)-), hereafter referred to as RGD-DTPA-octreotate, were evaluated in comparison with those of RGD (c(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Tyr-Asp)) and Tyr3-octreotate (D--c(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys--Cys)-).The therapeutic effects of RGD-111In-DTPA-octreotate, 111In-DTPA-RGD, and 111In-DTPA-Tyr3-octreotate were investigated with various cell lines by use of a colony-forming assay, and caspase-3 activity was also determined.Tumoricidal effects were found with 111In-DTPA-RGD, 111In-DTPA-Tyr3-octreotate, and RGD-111In-DTPA-octreotate, in order from least effective to most effective. Also, the largest increase in caspase-3 levels was found with RGD-111In-DTPA-octreotate.RGD-111In-DTPA-octreotate has more pronounced tumoricidal effects than 111In-DTPA-RGD and 111In-DTPA-Tyr3-octreotate, because of increased apoptosis, as indicated by increased caspase-3 activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1691914>Treatment of adjuvant arthritis in rats: vaccination potential of a synthetic nonapeptide from the 65 kDa heat shock protein of mycobacteria.</a></h2><p>Adjuvant arthritis induced by mycobacteria in rats is a widely used model of chronic arthritis. A previously described nonapeptide (--Gly-Leu-Gln-Leu-Glu-Leu-, amino acid sequence 180-188) from the recombinant 65 kDa heat shock protein of Mycobacterium bovis BCG, which was found to contain a T-cell epitope recognized by both arthritogenic and protective T-cell clones in vitro, has been investigated for its vaccination and therapeutic potential in adjuvant arthritis in rats. The nonapeptide was found not to be arthritogenic, although the T cells from nonapeptide immunized rats cross-react in vitro with mycobacterial antigens. Intraperitoneal administration of 0.1 mg nonapeptide in oil at day -20 or days -2, -1 and 0, resulted in a marked reduction of incidence and severity of adjuvant arthritis. The disease process and severity were also influenced by therapeutic treatment with 0.1 mg nonapeptide injected intraperitoneally at days 7 to 10. Interestingly, subplantar or intravenous application of the nonapeptide had no influence on the disease process. Deletion of the N-terminal threonine led to complete loss of in vivo activity of the nonapeptide.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9139690>Identification of framework residues in a secreted recombinant antibody fragment that control production level and localization in Escherichia coli.</a></h2><p>The monoclonal antibody 5T4, directed against a human tumor-associated antigen, was expressed as a secreted Fab superantigen fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The product is a putative agent for  of non-small cell lung cancer. During fermentation, most of the fusion protein leaked out from the periplasm to the growth medium at a level of approximately 40 mg/liter. This level was notably low compared with similar products containing identical CH1, CL, and superantigen moieties, and the Fv framework was therefore engineered. Using hybrid molecules, the light chain was found to limit high expression levels. Substituting five residues in VL increased the level almost 15 times, exceeding 500 mg/liter in the growth medium. Here, the substitutions -10 --> Ser, -45 --> Lys, -77 --> Ser, and Leu-78 --> Val were most powerful. In addition, replacing four VH residues diminished cell lysis during fermentation. Thereby the product was preferentially located in the periplasm instead of the growth medium, and the total yield was more than 700 mg/liter. All engineered products retained a high affinity for the tumor-associated antigen. It is suggested that at least some of the identified framework residues generally have to be replaced to obtain high level production of recombinant Fab products in E. coli.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7527447>A decapeptide (Gln-Asp-Leu--Met-Lys-Tyr-Gln-Ile-) from human melanoma is recognized by CTL in melanoma patients.</a></h2><p>The decapeptide 810 (QDLTMKYQIF) contains the antigenic epitope (KYQI) recognized by human mAb L92. This sequence is found in a 43-kDa protein associated with human melanoma M14. We examined the expression of 810 in human cells and its involvement in the cellular immune responses of melanoma patients. Nineteen stage III melanoma patients and 19 normal donors were studied for their responses to 810. All patients were immunized in vivo with an allogeneic melanoma cell vaccine. PBMC cytotoxicity was tested on autologous EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (BCL) pulsed with 810 and autologous melanomas. Proliferative responses of PBMC to 810 were evaluated by using [3H]Tdr incorporation assays. Western blotting revealed that the 43-kDa protein was not specific to melanoma but was common to various cells. However, the percentage of cytotoxicity of PBMC against autologous 810-pulsed BCL was significantly greater in melanoma patients than in normal controls (p < 0.005). Cytotoxicity was increased after melanoma cell vaccine immunization in 15 patients (78%). Proliferative responses to 810 were observed only in melanoma patients and were enhanced in 12 patients (63%) after vaccination. Restimulation of PBMC from vaccinated patients with 810 increased cytotoxicity against both autologous 810-pulsed BCL and melanomas. These targets were lysed by CD8+ T lymphocytes in an HLA class I-restricted manner. HLA-A2 and -A11 seemed to serve as the 810-presenting molecule. Our findings indicate that 810 may function as an epitope for CTL on human melanoma and can be used as a vaccine.</p></html>
