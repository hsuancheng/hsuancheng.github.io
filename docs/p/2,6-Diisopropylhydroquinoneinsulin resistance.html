A cross-sectional study was conducted between March and December 2018 at Ngarenaro and Kaloleni health facilities in Arusha District involving 230 randomly selected pregnant women who were not known to have diabetes before pregnancy. Blood glucose at fasting and  hr after consuming 75 grams of glucose dissolved in 300 mL of water was measured using Gluco-Plus™, serum  concentrations using ELISA machine (Synergy/HTX™; BioTek), and IR was calculated using the Homeostasis Model of Assessment formula. Body fat was measured using a bioelectric impedance analyzer, mid-upper arm circumference using a regular tape, weight using SECA™, blood pressure using GT-868UF Geratherm™ machine, and height by stadiometer. Maternal characteristics were collected through face to face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science™ Version 20.  The prevalence of IR was 21% ( = 49) and significantly associated with increased body fat percentage (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-.5), family history of Type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM; AOR: .77, 95% CI: 1.21-6.33), hypertension (AOR: .5, 95% CI: 1.12-5.6), edema (AOR: 3.01, 95% CI: 1.31-6.96), and proteinuria (AOR: 3.44, 95% CI: 1.11-10.69).  IR was higher among pregnant women with increased body fat percentage, family history of T2DM, hypertension, edema, and proteinuria. These findings call for large-scale screening to further explore risk factors to prevent gestational diabetes mellitus.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680281></a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652310>Kinome profiling reveals abnormal activity of kinases in skeletal muscle from adults with obesity and .</a></h1><p>Obesity-related  (OIR) is one of the main contributors to type  diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Protein kinases are implicated in  signaling and glucose metabolism. Molecular mechanisms underlying OIR involving global kinase activities remain incompletely understood.To investigate abnormal kinase activity associated with OIR in human skeletal muscle.Stable isotopic labeling-based quantitative proteomics combined with affinity-based​​ active enzyme probes to profile in vivo kinase activity in skeletal muscle from lean control (Lean) and OIR participants.Eight Lean and eight OIR non-diabetic human adults who underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with muscle biopsy.We identified the 1st active kinome comprised of 54 active protein kinases in human skeletal muscle. The activities of 23 kinases were different in OIR compared to Lean muscle (11 hyper- and 12 hypo-active), while their protein abundance was the same between the two groups. The activities of multiple kinases involved in AMPK and p38 signaling were lower in OIR compared to Lean. On the contrary, multiple kinases in the JNK signaling pathway exhibited higher activity in OIR vs. Lean. The kinase-substrate-prediction based on experimental data further confirmed a potential down-regulation of  signaling (e.g., inhibited phosphorylation of IRS1 and AKT1/).These findings provide a global view of the kinome activity in OIR and Lean muscle, pinpoint novel specific impairment in kinase activities in signaling pathways important for skeletal muscle  and may provide potential drug targets (i.e., abnormal kinase activities) to prevent and/or reverse skeletal muscle  in humans.© Endocrine Society 2019.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship of HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment of ) to polymorphic variants of Clock and Bmal1 genes in Chinese patients with essential hypertension. : A total of 334 outpatients with essential hypertension (103 patients of HOMA-IR positive and 231 patients of HOMA-IR negative) were recruited to analyze Clock T3111C and Bmal1 A1420G genotypes with DNA sequencing approach. : Waist circumference, body mass index, glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were significantly increased, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly decreased in patients with HOMA-IR positive ( < .05-0.001 vs. patients with HOMA-IR negative). Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed that 24-h mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), especially nightime SBP, was higher in patients with HOMA-IR positive ( < .05 vs. patients with HOMA-IR negative). Notably, compared with the negative group, the distribution frequency of C allele of Clock T3111C and GG genotype of Bmal1 A1420G were significantly higher in the HOMA-IR positive group (29.1 vs. 10.8%  < .000 and 43.7 vs. 27.7%  = .007, respectively). Logistic regression analysis showed that C allele of Clock T3111C (OR = 4.128, CI 95% .313-7.368,  = .000) and GG genotype of Bmal1 A1420G (OR = 1.983, CI 95% 1.117-3.521,  = .019) were independent risk factors for potential HOMA-IR in Chinese patients with essential hypertension. : Our results indicated that Chinese hypertensive patients with C allele of Clock T3111C or GG genotype of Bmal1 A1420G might be susceptible to IR and are more likely to develop high nighttime SBP.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641146>Sustained Improvements in Glucose Metabolism Late After Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery in Patients with and Without Preoperative Diabetes.</a></h1><p>To describe glucose metabolism in the late, weight stable phase after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) in patients with and without preoperative type  diabetes we invited 55 RYGB-operated persons from two existing cohorts to participate in a late follow-up study. 44 (24 with normal glucose tolerance (NGT)/20 with type  diabetes (T2D) before surgery) accepted the invitation (median follow-up .7 [Range .-5.0 years]). Subjects were examined during an oral glucose stimulus and results compared to preoperative and 1-year (1 y) post RYGB results. Glucose tolerance, , beta-cell function and incretin hormone secretion were evaluated. 1 y weight loss was maintained late after surgery. Glycemic control, , beta-cell function and GLP-1 remained improved late after surgery in both groups. In NGT subjects, nadir glucose decreased 1 y after RYGB, but did not change further. In T2D patients, relative change in weight from 1 y to late after RYGB correlated with relative change in fasting glucose and HbA1c, whereas relative changes in glucose-stimulated  release correlated inversely with relative changes in postprandial glucose excursions. In NGT subjects, relative changes in postprandial nadir glucose correlated with changes in beta-cell glucose sensitivity. Thus, effects of RYGB on weight and glucose metabolism are maintained late after surgery in patients with and without preoperative T2D. Weight loss and improved beta-cell function both contribute to maintenance of long-term glycemic control in patients with type  diabetes, and increased glucose stimulated  secretion may contribute to postprandial hypoglycemia in NGT subjects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661889>Combined Exposure to Fructose and Bisphenol A Exacerbates Abnormal Lipid Metabolism in Liver of Developmental Male Rats.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether combined exposure to fructose and bisphenol A (BPA) has a synergistic effect on abnormal lipid metabolism in the liver of developmental male rats and its possible mechanism. Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating lipid metabolism include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), zinc α  glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, , IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured. Liver tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing lipogenesis were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia,  and hepatic fat accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in liver, and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group. Therefore, abnormal lipid metabolism in the liver of developmental rats could be exacerbated by combined exposed to fructose and BPA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640890>The probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum 296 attenuates cardiometabolic disorders in high fat diet-treated rats.</a></h1><p>High-fat (HF) diet consumption has been associated with gut dysbiosis and increased risk of dyslipidemia, type  diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Probiotic administration has been suggested as a safe therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiometabolic disorders. This study was designed to assess the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus (L.) fermentum 296, a fruit-derived bacteria strain, against cardiometabolic disorders induced by HF diet.Male Wistar rats were divided into control diet (CTL); HF diet; and HF diet treated with Lactobacillus fermentum 296 (HF + Lf 296). The L. fermentum 296 strain at 1 × 10 colony forming units (CFU)/ml were daily administered by oral gavage for 4 weeks. The results showed that rats fed with HF diet displayed , reduced Lactobacillus spp. counts in feces, serum lipids, and oxidative profile. Rats fed on HF diet also demonstrated augmented blood pressure associated with sympathetic hyperactivity and impaired baroreflex control. The administration of L. fermentum 296 for 4 weeks recovered fecal Lactobacillus sp. counts and alleviated hyperlipidemia, sympathetic hyperactivity, and reduced systolic blood pressure in HF rats without affecting baroreflex sensibility.Our results suggest the ability of L. fermentum 296 improve biochemical and cardiovascular parameters altered in cardiometabolic disorders.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Cookie meal testing (carbohydrates: 75 g, fats: 28.5 g), endothelial function testing using flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), and body composition evaluation were performed before and after six months of treatment. Changes in %FMD between the treatment periods and its association with metabolic biomarkers were evaluated.After six months of treatment, the body weight and body fat percentage decreased significantly, while the body muscle percentage increased significantly. The hemoglobin A1c level and fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels were significantly decreased with treatment. Postprandial  secretion was also significantly suppressed and the  index was significantly decreased. Furthermore, the fasting and postprandial triglyceride (TG) levels decreased significantly, while total ketone bodies increased significantly after the six-month treatment. While the plasma brain natriuretic peptide level was not changed, the C-reactive protein level was decreased and FMD was significantly improved after the six-month treatment. Multiple regression analysis showed that the strongest predictive factor of FMD improvement is change in the plasma TG levels.SGLT2 inhibitors improve multiple metabolic parameters. Of these, a reduction in plasma TGs was strongly associated with endothelial function recovery in diabetic patients with CAD, and this reduction may be related to the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599392>Acanthosis Nigricans in the Knuckles of Infants: A Novel Clinical Marker of High Metabolic Risk.</a></h1><p>Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is an early clinical sign of  (IR) primarily in adults. The prevalence and association of AN and IR in infants, however, remains uncertain. We aimed to describe the prevalence of AN and its association with IR in a group of Latin-American infants.We studied a random sample of 227 healthy infants between 9 and 24 months of age. After a complete clinical history was obtained and a physical examination was performed, fasting plasma glucose and serum  were measured. Three blinded evaluators assessed AN in each patient. Infants with AN were categorized as cases. The HOMA-IR index cutoffs of ≥ 90th and ≥ 95th percentiles were considered IR.There were 49 infants with AN (21.6%) (cases) and 178 without AN (78.4%) (controls). Cases had a significantly higher mean serum , fasting plasma glucose, and HOMA-IR levels of 3.67 ± .56 µU/ml vs. .42 ± 1.45 µU/ml, P = 0.005; 84. ± 12.6 mg/dL vs. 77 ± SD 9.9 mg/dL, P ≤ 0.001; HOMA-IR 0.77 ± 0.54 vs. 0.46 ± 0.28, P ≤ 0.001, respectively. More cases than controls presented HOMA-IR levels ≥ 95th percentile (cases 18.4%; controls 0.5%, P ≤ 0.001) and ≥ 90th percentile (cases 32.7%; controls 1.6%, P ≤ 0.001). AN in the knuckles had a high sensitivity and a negative predictive value (NPV) for detecting patients with HOMA-IR levels above the 95th percentile (sensitivity 90%; NPV 99.4%) and above the 90th percentile (sensitivity 84.%; NPV 98.3%).AN in the knuckles is a prevalent, non-invasive, costless, and reliable screening clinical tool that can be used for early detection of infants with IR and a high metabolic risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675433>Simultaneous angiotensin receptor blockade and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor activation ameliorate albuminuria in obese -resistant rats.</a></h1><p> increases renal oxidant production by up-regulating NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) expression contributing to oxidative damage and ultimately albuminuria. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and activation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor signaling may reverse this effect. However, whether angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1) blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation improve oxidative damage and albuminuria through different mechanisms is not known. Using  resistant Otsuka Long Evan Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, we tested the hypothesis that simultaneous blockade of AT1 and activation of GLP-1r additively decrease oxidative damage and urinary albumin excretion (U V) in the following groups: (1) untreated, lean LETO (n=7), () untreated, obese OLETF (n=9), (3) OLETF + angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB; 10 mg olmesartan /kg/d; n=9), (4) OLETF + GLP-1 mimetic (EXE; 10 ug exenatide/kg/d; n=7), and (5) OLETF + ARB + exenatide (Combo; n=6). Mean kidney Nox4 protein expression and nitrotyrosine (NT) levels were 30% and 46% greater, respectively, in OLETF compared to LETO. Conversely, Nox4 protein expression and NT were reduced to LETO levels in ARB and EXE, and Combo reduced Nox4, NT, and 4-hydroxy--nonenal levels by 21%, 27%, and 27%, respectively. At baseline, U V was nearly double in OLETF compared to LETO, and increased to nearly 10-fold greater levels by the end of the study. While ARB (45%) and EXE (55%) individually reduced U V, the combination completely ameliorated the albuminuria. Collectively, these data suggest that AT1 blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation reduce renal oxidative damage similarly during , while targeting both signaling pathways provides added benefit in restoring and/or further ameliorating albuminuria in a model of diet-induced obesity.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642314> Inhibits Aβ42 Aggregation and Prevents Aβ42-Induced Membrane Disruption.</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with self-assembly of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) into soluble oligomers. Of the two predominant Aβ alloforms, Aβ40 and Aβ42, the latter is particularly strongly linked to AD. Longitudinal studies revealed a correlation between AD and type  diabetes (T2D), characterized by abnormal  levels and . Although administration of intranasal  is explored as a therapy against AD, it is unclear to which extent  affects Aβ dynamics and activity.

We demonstrate that quiescently incubated , which does not form amyloid fibrils, over time develops membrane-disrupting capacity, which we propose to originate in misfolded  monomers. These hypothetically toxic misfolded monomers might contribute to the development of  in early stages of T2D that are associated with abnormally high  levels. We show that in contrast to quiescent incubation,  incubated at agitated conditions readily forms amyloid fibrils, which protect against membrane permeation.  quiescently incubated with Aβ42 attenuates both Aβ42 fibril formation and the ability of Aβ42 to disrupt membranes in a concentration dependent manner. Our findings offer insights into interactions between  and Aβ42 that are relevant to understanding the molecular basis of intranasal  as a therapy against Aβ-induced AD pathology, thereby elucidating a plausible mechanism underlying the observed correlations between AD and T2D.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635188>A Fermented Food Product Containing Lactic Acid Bacteria Protects ZDF Rats from the Development of Type  Diabetes.</a></h1><p>Type  diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disease, which involves a maintained hyperglycemia due to the development of an  process. Among multiple risk factors, host intestinal microbiota has received increasing attention in T2D etiology and progression. In the present study, we have explored the effect of long-term supplementation with a non-dairy fermented food product (FFP) in Zucker Diabetic and Fatty (ZDF) rats T2D model. The supplementation with FFP induced an improvement in glucose homeostasis according to the results obtained from fasting blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance test, and pancreatic function. Importantly, a significantly reduced intestinal glucose absorption was found in the FFP-treated rats. Supplemented animals also showed a greater survival suggesting a better health status as a result of the FFP intake. Some dissimilarities have been observed in the gut microbiota population between control and FFP-treated rats, and interestingly a tendency for better cardiometabolic markers values was appreciated in this group. However, no significant differences were observed in body weight, body composition, or food intake between groups. These findings suggest that FFP induced gut microbiota modifications in ZDF rats that improved glucose metabolism and protected from T2D development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641635>Comparison of the Different PCOS Phenotypes Based on Clinical Metabolic, and Hormonal Profile, and their Response to Clomiphene.</a></h1><p>To compare the different polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes based on their clinical, metabolic, hormonal profile, and their differential response to clomiphene.Prospective observational study.Infertility clinic, a government hospital.164 women with PCOS-related infertility.Sample population was divided into four phenotypes based on the NIH (National Institute of Health) consensus panel criteria. The incremental dose of clomiphene from 50 to 150 mg/day over three cycles was given.Clinical history, metabolic, hormonal profile, and ultrasound features of each phenotype. Also, the response to clomiphene citrate was studied as presence or absence of ovulation.The prevalence of phenotypes A, B, C, and D were 67.7%, 11%, 17.7%, and 3.6%, respectively. Phenotype A had significantly higher weight, body mass index, clinical, and biochemical hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities, ovarian reserve parameters, fasting , HOMA-IR, and more deranged lipid profile ( < 0.05). Clomiphene  was significantly more common in phenotype A ( < 0.05). No significant differences were noted in the waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure and blood sugar values (fasting, 1-hour postprandial, -hour postprandial). Also, the Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), LH-FSH ratio, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and vitamin D levels were not significantly different among various PCOS phenotypes.Full-blown PCOS (phenotype A) is at a higher risk of adverse metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes as compared with the others, and phenotype D is the least severe phenotype. Thus, the phenotypic division of patients with PCOS-related infertility can help in prognosticating the patients about the severity of the disease and the fertility outcome.Copyright: © 2019 Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619648>Myo-Inositol for the Prevention of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus. A Brief Review.</a></h1><p>Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is one of the most frequent complications of pregnancy and is characterized by a carbohydrate intolerance which is diagnosed with the oral glucose tolerance test. The prevalence of GDM in our population is about 12%, but risk factors like a previous GDM, ethnicity, a parent with diabetes mellitus type  and maternal overweight may increase its occurrence. Complications of GDM are a pre-term birth (before 37 wk gestation), macrosomia (birth weight ≥4 kg) and gestational hypertension. Actually, GDM is principally treated with diet and, if it is necessary, with ; but the challenge is the prevention of GDM. Among the measures used, changes in life-style (diet+exercise) failed to prevent GDM whereas metformin showed conflicting results. A promising supplement is myo-inositol (MI) which was given from first trimester until delivery to women at risk for GDM reporting a significant decrease in GDM occurrence by more than 60% comparing to the placebo group. Recently, a secondary analysis from 3 randomized controlled trials demonstrated that MI may also significantly reduce some of GDM complications such as pre-term birth and macrosomia with a favorable impact on mother and fetus well being.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669422>Differential metabolic and multi-tissue Transcriptomic responses to fructose consumption among genetically diverse mice.</a></h1><p>Understanding how individuals react differently to the same treatment is a major concern in precision medicine. Metabolic challenges such as the one posed by high fructose intake are important determinants of disease mechanisms. We embarked on studies to determine how fructose affects differential metabolic dysfunctions across genetically dissimilar mice, namely, C57BL/6 J (B6), DBA/ J (DBA) and FVB/NJ (FVB), by integrating physiological and gene regulatory mechanisms. We report that fructose has strain-specific effects, involving tissue-specific gene regulatory cascades in hypothalamus, liver, and white adipose tissues. DBA mice showed the largest numbers of genes associated with adiposity, congruent with their highest susceptibility to adiposity gain and glucose intolerance across the three tissues. In contrast, B6 and FVB mainly exhibited cholesterol phenotypes, accompanying the largest number of adipose genes correlating with total cholesterol in B6, and liver genes correlating with LDL in FVB mice. Tissue-specific network modeling predicted strain-and tissue-specific regulators such as Fgf21 (DBA) and Lss (B6), which were subsequently validated in primary hepatocytes. Strain-specific fructose-responsive genes revealed susceptibility for human diseases such that genes in liver and adipose tissue in DBA showed strong enrichment for human type  diabetes and obesity traits. Liver and adipose tissues genes in FVB were mostly related to lipid traits, and liver and adipose genes in B6 showed relevance to most cardiometabolic traits tested. Our results show that fructose induces gene regulatory pathways that are tissue specific and dependent on the genetic make-up, which may underlie interindividual variability in cardiometabolic responses to high fructose consumption.Copyright © 2019.

Emerging data suggest that chronic vinegar ingestion impacts fat metabolism and reduces adiposity, although no study has yet corroborated the events of vinegar supplementation metabolically through a metabolomics approach. To examine the impact of daily vinegar ingestion on glucose homeostasis, adiposity, and the metabolome, an 8-week, randomized controlled trial design was implemented utilizing two parallel treatment arms: daily red wine vinegar ingestion and a control treatment. Participants were 45 healthy adults at increased risk for metabolic complications as determined by high waist circumferences. Measurements and blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention. Central adiposity and visceral fat were assessed by waist circumference and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, respectively. Plasma metabolites were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography-MS/MS. Analysis showed significant reductions in fasting glucose (p = 0.003) and  (p < 0.001).  was reduced 8.3% in the red wine vinegar group and increased 9.7% in the control group (p < 0.001). No significant between-group differences in body mass index, body weight, waist circumference, or visceral fat were observed. Significant differences were observed in amino valerate and indole-3-acetic acid (p < 0.05), with high magnitudes of fold change (>) between groups. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed significant alterations in tryptophan metabolism. Although daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks induced significant improvements in glucose homeostasis, our results indicate that daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks is not associated with reductions in adiposity. This is the first study to investigate the effects of daily red wine vinegar supplementation using a metabolomics approach. Our results provide strong rationales for larger prospective studies to further clarify associations among obesity, chronic diseases, and functional foods such as vinegar using metabolomics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670603>Naringenin Increases  Sensitivity and Metabolic Rate: A Case Study.</a></h1><p>Our studies in primary human adipocytes show that naringenin, a citrus flavonoid, increases oxygen consumption rate and gene expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), glucose transporter type 4, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). We investigated the safety of naringenin, its effects on metabolic rate, and blood glucose and  responses in a single female subject with diabetes. The subject ingested 150 mg naringenin from an extract of whole oranges standardized to 28% naringenin three times/day for 8 weeks, and maintained her usual food intake. Body weight, resting metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, and blood chemistry panel including glucose, , and safety markers were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Adverse events were evaluated every  weeks. We also examined the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase G (PKG) in the response of human adipocytes to naringenin treatment. Compared to baseline, the body weight decreased by .3 kg. The metabolic rate peaked at 3.5% above baseline at 1 h, but there was no change in the respiratory quotient. Compared to baseline,  decreased by 18%, but the change in glucose was not clinically significant. Other blood safety markers were within their reference ranges, and there were no adverse events.  and  mRNA expression was reduced by inhibitors of PPAR and PPAR, but there was no effect of PKA or PKG inhibition. We conclude that naringenin supplementation is safe in humans, reduces body weight and , and increases metabolic rate by PPAR and PPAR activation.

Despite greater intramuscular lipids, athletes are highly  sensitive, which could result from higher rates of -stimulated glycogen synthesis or glucose transport/phosphorylation and oxidation. Thus, we examined the time course of muscle glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations during low and high systemic lipid availability.METHODSEight endurance-trained and 9 sedentary humans (VO2 peak: 56 ±  vs. 33 ±  mL/kg/min, P < 0.05) underwent 6-hour hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp tests with infusions of triglycerides or saline in a randomized crossover design. Glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations were monitored in vastus lateralis muscles using 13C/31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy.RESULTSAthletes displayed a 25% greater (P < 0.05) -stimulated glucose disposal rate (Rd) than sedentary participants. During Intralipid infusion,  sensitivity remained higher in the athletes (ΔRd: 25 ± 3 vs. 17 ± 3 μmol/kg/min, P < 0.05), supported by higher glucose transporter type 4 protein expression than in sedentary humans. Compared to saline infusion, AUC of glucose-6-phosphate remained unchanged during Intralipid infusion in athletes (1.6 ± 0. mmol/L vs. 1.4 ± 0. [mmol/L] × h, P = n.s.) but tended to decrease by 36% in sedentary humans (1.7 ± 0.4 vs. 1.1 ± 0.1 [mmol/L] × h, P < 0.059). This drop was accompanied by a 72% higher rate of net glycogen synthesis in the athletes upon Intralipid infusion (47 ± 9 vs. 13 ± 3 μmol/kg/min, P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONAthletes feature higher skeletal muscle glucose disposal and glycogen synthesis during increased lipid availability, which primarily results from maintained -stimulated glucose transport with increased myocellular glucose-6-phosphate levels for subsequent glycogen synthesis.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov .FUNDINGGerman Federal Ministry of Health (BMG).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592400>Drug development research for novel adiponectin receptor-targeted antidiabetic drugs contributing to healthy longevity.</a></h1><p>It is well recognized that the decrease of adiponectin associated with high-fat diet and lack of exercise accounts for the onset of , type  diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Our research efforts have led to the identification of adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, with the former shown to activate AMP kinase in the liver and the latter shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α signaling thereby increasing fatty acid oxidation. Again, adiponectin upregulates mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle thereby improving glucose/lipid metabolism and . These findings suggested that activation of adiponectin/AdipoR signaling could represent a viable therapeutic approach to lifestyle-linked diseases associated with prevalent obesity thus contributing to healthy longevity in humans. Indeed, they have led to the successful discovery of AdipoRon, a small-molecule AdipoR-activating compound. Thus far, AdipoRon has been found not only to improve  in mice but to prolong their lifespan shortened by high-fat diet. Additionally, our structure-based drug discovery research has led to AdipoR being identified as an entirely novel structure having a zinc iron bound within its seven-transmembrane domain as well as an opposite orientation to that of G protein-coupled receptors. It is expected that increasing insight into AdipoR signaling will facilitate the structure-based optimization of candidate small-molecule AdipoR-activating compounds for human use as well as the development of molecularly targeted and calorie-limiting/exercise-mimicking agents for lifestyle-linked diseases.© The Japan Diabetes Society 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647291>Associations between homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and routinely examined parameters in individuals with metabolic syndrome.</a></h1><p>The aim of the study was to investigate whether routine clinical parameters, including visceral adiposity index (VAI) and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), could become widely applicable predictors of  (IR), evaluated using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR, HOMA-beta), with regard to presence of metabolic syndrome (MS). The study comprised 188 individuals identified to meet the MS criteria during regular health examinations and an equal number of age, sex-matched controls without MS. The strongest correlations were noted between HOMA-IR and waist circumference (WC) in the MS group (r=0.57) as well as between HOMA-IR and alanine aminotransferase (ALT, r=0.57) or aspartate aminotransferase (r=0.56) in the controls, with a statistical significance of p<0.001. In a multivariate linear regression model, the predictors of HOMA-IR were WC (linear coefficient beta=0.1, p<0.001), ALT (beta=.28, p<0.001) and systolic blood pressure (beta=0.04, p<0.001). HOMA-beta was determined by WC (beta=1.97, p=0.032) and ALT (beta=99.49, p=0.004) and inversely associated with age (beta=-1.31, p=0.004). Neither VAI nor AIP were significant predictors. The presence of MS was significantly associated with both HOMA-IR and HOMA-beta. These results indicate that WC and ALT appear to be reliable predictors of IR. Comprehensive assessment of these parameters may serve for estimating the level of IR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663469>Effects of pterostilbene on diabetes, liver steatosis and serum lipids.</a></h1><p>Pterostilbene, a phenolic compound derived from resveratrol, possesses greater bioavailability than its parent compound due to the presence of two methoxyl groups. In this review, the beneficial effects of pterostilbene on diabetes, liver steatosis and dyslipidemia are summarized. Pterostilbene is a useful bioactive compound in preventing type 1 diabetes,  and type  diabetes in animal models. Concerning type 1 diabetes, the main mechanisms described to justify the positive effects of this phenolic compound are increased liver glycogen content and hepatic glucokinase and phosphofructokinase activities, the recovery of pancreatic islet architecture, cytoprotection and a decrease in serum and pancreatic pro-inflammatory cytokines. As for type  diabetes, increased liver glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase and decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activities are reported. When  is induced by diets, a greater activation of  signaling cascade has been reported, increased cardiotrophin-1 levels and liver glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities, and a decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activity. Data concerning pterostilbene and liver steatosis are scarce so far, but the reduction in oxidative stress induced by pterostilbene may be involved since oxidative stress is related to the progression of steatosis to steatohepatitis. Finally, pterostilbene effectivelly reduces total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels, while increases HDL-cholesterol in animal models of dyslipidemia.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661295>Effects of resistant starch on glycemic control, serum lipoproteins and systemic inflammation in patients with metabolic syndrome and related disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials.</a></h1><p>The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of resistant starch (RS) on glycemic status, serum lipoproteins and inflammatory markers in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and related disorders. Two independent authors systematically searched online database including EMBASE, Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception until 30 April 2019. Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool was applied to assess the methodological quality of included trials. The heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed using Cochrane's Q test and I-square (I) statistic. Data were pooled using a random-effects model and weighted mean difference (WMD) was considered as the overall effect size. Nineteen trials were included in this meta-analysis. Administration of RS resulted in significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (14 studies) (WMD: -4.28; 95% CI: -7.01, -1.55),  (12 studies) (WMD: -1.95; 95% CI: -3.22, -0.68), and HbA1C (8 studies) (WMD: -0.60; 95% CI: -0.95, -0.24).

Excitotoxicity is initiated primarily by the sustained stimulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors and leads to a rise in intracellular Ca ([Ca]  ), followed by a cascade of intracellular events, such as delayed calcium deregulation (DCD), mitochondrial depolarization, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion that collectively end in cell death. Therefore, cross-talk between  and glutamate signaling in excitotoxicity is of particular interest for research. In the present study, we investigated the effects of short-term  exposure on the dynamics of [Ca]  and mitochondrial potential in cultured rat cortical neurons during glutamate excitotoxicity. We found that  ameliorated the glutamate-evoked rise of [Ca]  and prevented the onset of DCD, the postulated point-of-no-return in excitotoxicity. Additionally,  significantly improved the glutamate-induced drop in mitochondrial potential, ATP depletion, and depletion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is a critical neuroprotector in excitotoxicity. Also,  improved oxygen consumption rates, maximal respiration, and spare respiratory capacity in neurons exposed to glutamate, as well as the viability of cells in the MTT assay. In conclusion, the short-term  exposure in our experiments was evidently a protective treatment against excitotoxicity, in a sharp contrast to chronic  exposure causal to neuronal , the adverse factor in excitotoxicity.Copyright © 2019 Krasil’nikova, Surin, Sorokina, Fisenko, Boyarkin, Balyasin, Demchenko, Pomytkin and Pinelis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620632>Cognitive dysfunctions in individuals with diabetes mellitus.</a></h1><p>Some patients with type 1 and type  diabetes mellitus (DM) present with cognitive dysfunctions. The pathophysiology underlying this complication is not well understood. Type 1 DM has been associated with a decrease in the speed of information processing, psychomotor efficiency, attention, mental flexibility, and visual perception. Longitudinal epidemiological studies of type 1 DM have indicated that chronic hyperglycemia and microvascular disease, rather than repeated severe hypoglycemia, are associated with the pathogenesis of DM-related cognitive dysfunction. However, severe hypoglycemic episodes may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in high-risk patients with DM. Type  DM has been associated with memory deficits, decreased psychomotor speed, and reduced frontal lobe/executive function. In type  DM, chronic hyperglycemia, long duration of DM, presence of vascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension and obesity), and microvascular and macrovascular complications are associated with the increased risk of developing cognitive dysfunction. The pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with DM include the following: (1) role of hyperglycemia, () role of vascular disease, (3) role of hypoglycemia, and (4) role of  and amyloid. Recently, some investigators have proposed that type 3 DM is correlated to sporadic Alzheimer's disease. The molecular and biochemical consequences of  and -like growth factor  in the brain compromise neuronal survival, energy production, gene expression, plasticity, and white matter integrity. If patients claim that their performance is worsening or if they ask about the effects of DM on functioning, screening and assessment are recommended.Copyright © 2019 Yeungnam University College of Medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665391>A Combination of Metabolites Predicts Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet Pattern and Its Associations with  Sensitivity and Lipid Homeostasis in the General Population: The Fenland Study, United Kingdom.</a></h1><p>Cardiometabolic benefits of the Mediterranean diet have been recognized, but underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.We aimed to investigate how the Mediterranean diet could influence circulating metabolites and how the metabolites could mediate the associations of the diet with cardiometabolic risk factors.Among 10,806 participants (58.9% women, mean age = 48.4 y) in the Fenland Study (2004-2015) in the United Kingdom, we assessed dietary consumption with FFQs and conducted a targeted metabolomics assay for 175 plasma metabolites (acylcarnitines, amines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids). We examined cross-sectional associations of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and its major components with each metabolite, modeling multivariable-adjusted linear regression. We used the regression estimates to summarize metabolites associated with the MDS into a metabolite score as a marker of the diet. Subsequently, we assessed how much metabolite subclasses and the metabolite score would mediate the associations of the MDS with circulating lipids, homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR), and other metabolic factors by comparing regression estimates upon adjustment for the metabolites.Sixty-six metabolites were significantly associated with the MDS (P ≤ 0.003, corrected for false discovery rate) (Spearman correlations, r: -0.28 to +0.28). The metabolite score was moderately correlated with the MDS (r = 0.43). Of MDS components, consumption of nuts, cereals, and meats contributed to variations in acylcarnitines; fruits, to amino acids and amines; and fish, to phospholipids. The metabolite score was estimated to explain 37.% of the inverse association of the MDS with HOMA-IR (P for mediation < 0.05). The associations of the MDS with cardiometabolic factors were estimated to be mediated by acylcarnitines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids.Multiple metabolites relate to the Mediterranean diet in a healthy general British population and highlight the potential to identify a set of biomarkers for an overall diet. The associations may involve pathways of phospholipid metabolism, carnitine metabolism, and development of  and dyslipidemia.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679020>Metabolic syndrome and related risk factors among adults in the northern West Bank, a cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors that includes central obesity, , dyslipidaemia and hypertension. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of MetS and its associated risk factors among adult Palestinians using the International Diabetes Federation definition.A total of 1348 subjects ages 18-65 y were recruited in a cross-sectional study that was conducted in 2018-2019 in the northern West Bank.A total of 1082 subjects participated; 51.7% were men. The prevalence of MetS was high (44.9%), and higher among women (46.1%) than men (44.%) (p<0.001). The prevalence increased significantly with increasing age and body mass index (BMI) in both genders (p<0.001). However, metabolically obese but normal weight individuals (MONW) (8.4%) were also identified, with a slight increase among women (9.4%) compared with men (7.5%) (p=0.56). MetS was more likely to be prevalent among participants with increased fasting blood sugar (5.8 times), increased triglyceride (7.4 times), increased blood pressure (4.5 times) and BMI ≥25 (19.9 times) (p<0.001). The prevalence of MetS was higher among rural (50.3%) vs urban (39.3%) residents and refugees (33.8%).With increasing age and obesity, clustering of MetS components increased remarkably in both genders. Effective prevention and treatment strategies for MetS and its risk factors should be developed targeting different ages and genders.© The Author(s) 2019.

Moreover, central characteristics of the MetS like inflammation, obesity and  have been associated with the frailty syndrome. However, the relationship between MetS and frailty has not yet been studied in detail. Aim of the current analysis within the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) was to explore associations between MetS and frailty taking important co-variables such as nutrition (total energy intake, dietary vitamin D intake), physical activity and vitamin D-status into account.Complete cross-sectional data of 1,486 old participants (50.% women, 68.7 (65.8-71.3) years) of BASE-II were analyzed. MetS was defined following the joint interim statement of the International Diabetes Federation Task Force on Epidemiology and Prevention; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; American Heart Association; World Heart Federation; International Atherosclerosis Society; and International Association for the Study of Obesity in 2009. Frailty was defined according to the Fried criteria. Limitations in physical performance were assessed via questionnaire, muscle mass was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and grip strength using a Smedley dynamometer. Adjusted regression models were calculated to assess the association between MetS and Frailty.MetS was prevalent in 37.6% of the study population and 31.9% were frail or prefrail according to the here calculated frailty index. In adjusted models the odds of being frail/prefrail were increased about 50% with presence of the MetS (OR1.5; 95% CI 1.,1.9; p= 0.002). Moreover the odds of being prefrail/frail were significantly increased with low HDL-C (OR: 1.5 (95%CI: 1.0-.3); p = 0.037); and elevated waist circumference (OR: 1.65 (95%CI: 1.1-.3); p = 0.008).The current analysis supports an association between MetS and frailty. There are various metabolic, immune and endocrine alterations in MetS that also play a role in mechanisms underlying the frailty syndrome. To what extent cytokine alterations, inflammatory processes, vitamin D supply and hormonal changes in age and in special metabolic states as MetS influence the development of frailty should be subject of further research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617909>Sexual dimorphism in obesity-associated endothelial ENaC activity and stiffening in mice.</a></h1><p>Obesity and  stiffen the vasculature with females appearing to be more adversely affected.

Here we provide evidence that female mice are more susceptible to Western diet-induced endothelial cell stiffening compared to age-matched males.

However, little is known about the mechanism through which physical activity impacts cancer survivors' cognition.The objective of this secondary analysis examined physical and psychological function potentially linking physical activity with changes in cognition among breast cancer survivors in a randomized controlled trial where the exercise arm had greater improvements in cognition than the control arm.A total of 87 sedentary breast cancer survivors were randomized to a 12-week physical activity intervention (n=43) or control condition (n=44). Objectively measured processing speed (National Institutes of Health Toolbox Oral Symbol Digit), self-reported cognition (patient-reported outcomes measurement information system [PROMIS] cognitive abilities), PROMIS measures of physical and psychological function (depression, anxiety, fatigue, and physical functioning), and plasma biomarkers (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, homeostatic model assessment  of , and C-reactive protein [CRP]) were collected at baseline and 12 weeks. Linear mixed-effects models tested intervention effects on changes in physical and psychological function variables and biomarkers. Bootstrapping was used to assess mediation. Exploratory analyses examined self-reported cognitive abilities and processing speed as mediators of the intervention effect on physical functioning.Participants in the exercise arm had significantly greater improvements in physical functioning (beta=1.23; 95% CI .42 to 0.03; P=.049) and reductions in anxiety (beta=-1.50; 95% CI -0.07 to -.94; P=.04) than those in the control arm. Anxiety significantly mediated the intervention effect on cognitive abilities (bootstrap 95% CI -1.96 to -0.06), whereas physical functioning did not (bootstrap 95% CI -1.12 to 0.10). Neither anxiety (bootstrap 95% CI -1.18 to 0.74) nor physical functioning (bootstrap 95% CI -.34 to 0.15) mediated the intervention effect on processing speed. Of the biomarkers, only CRP had greater changes in the exercise arm than the control arm (beta=.253; 95% CI -0.04 to 0.57; P=.09), but CRP was not associated with cognition; therefore, none of the biomarker measures mediated the intervention effect on cognition. Neither cognitive abilities (bootstrap 95% CI -0.06 to 0.68) nor processing speed (bootstrap 95% CI -0.15 to 0.63) mediated the intervention effect on physical function.Physical activity interventions may improve self-reported cognition by decreasing anxiety.

Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) measures oscillation in messenger RNA expression, an essential foundation for the study of the physiological circadian regulatory network. Primarily, measured oscillations have involved the use of reference gene normalization. However, the validation and identification of suitable reference genes is a significant challenge across different biological systems. This study focuses on adipose tissue of premenopausal, otherwise healthy, morbidly obese women voluntarily enrolled after being scheduled for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery. Acquisition of tissue was accomplished by aspiratory needle biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissue 1 to  weeks prior to surgery and 12 to 13 weeks following surgery and an in-surgery scalpel-assisted excision of mesenteric adipose tissue. Each biopsy was sterile cultured ex vivo and serially collected every 4 h over approximately 36 h. The candidate reference genes that were tested were 18S rRNA, GAPDH, HPRT1, RPII, RPL13α, and YWHAZ. Three analytic tools were used to test suitability, and the candidate reference genes were used to measure oscillation in expression of a known circadian clock element (Dbp). No gene was deemed suitable as an individual reference gene control, which indicated that the optimal reference gene set was the geometrically averaged 3-gene panel composed of YWHAZ, RPL13α, and GAPDH.

Genetic ablation of CD40L reduced adipose tissue inflammation, while absence of CD40 resulted in aggravated metabolic dysfunction in mice. During obesity, CD40 expressing CD11c dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages accumulate in adipose tissue and liver.

Moreover, CD40CD11c mice had higher plasma and hepatic cholesterol levels and developed profound liver steatosis. Overall, regulatory T cell numbers were decreased in these mice.

Our experiments suggest that CD40 expressing CD11c cells can act as a double-edged sword: CD40 expressing CD11c cells contribute to liver inflammation during NASH but are protective against the metabolic syndrome via induction of regulatory T cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648561>KLF15-activating Twist2 ameliorated hepatic steatosis by inhibiting inflammation and improving mitochondrial dysfunction  NF-κB-FGF21 or SREBP1c-FGF21 pathway.</a></h1><p>Twist-related protein  (TWIST2) is identified as a basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) transcription repressor by dimerizing with other b-HLH proteins. The significance of TWIST2 has been emphasized in various tumors; however, few studies report its functions in metabolism and metabolic diseases. Here we aimed to explore the novel role and regulation mechanism of TWIST2 in hepatic steatosis. Our results showed that  knockdown caused mice obesity, , and hepatic steatosis, which were accompanied with inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. , TWIST2 overexpression ameliorated hepatocellular steatosis, inhibited inflammation, and improved mitochondrial content and function with a fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)-dependent pattern. NF-κB negatively regulated FGF21 transcription by directly binding to  promoter DNA, which was eliminated by TWIST2 overexpression by inhibiting NF-κB expression and translocation to nucleus. TWIST2 overexpression decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species level, increased mitochondrial DNA and biogenesis, and enhanced ATP production and antioxidation ability. Additionally, TWIST2 expression was repressed by -targeting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and forkhead box protein O1 and was enhanced by dexamethasone targeting Krüppel-like factor 15, which directly interacted with  promoter DNA. Together, our studies identify an important role and regulation mechanism of TWIST2 in maintaining hepatic homeostasis by ameliorating steatosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress  the NF-κB-FGF21 or SREBP1c-FGF21 pathway, which may provide a new therapeutic scheme for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.-Zhou, L., Li, Q., Chen, A., Liu, N., Chen, N., Chen, X., Zhu, L., Xia, B., Gong, Y., Chen, X.

Participants were randomly divided into  groups to take either melatonin ( x 5mg/day) (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) 1 hour before bedtime for 12 weeks. The effects of melatonin on mental health, metabolic status, and gene expression related to metabolic status were assessed using multiple linear regression adjusting for age and BMI.Melatonin supplementation significantly decreased Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (P = .007), Beck Depression Inventory index (P = .001), and Beck Anxiety Inventory index (P = .01) compared with the placebo. Additionally, melatonin administration significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose (β = -21.77 mg/dL, 95% CI -33.22 to -10.33, P < .001), serum  levels (β = -1.89 μIU/mL, 95% CI -3.34 to -0.45, P = .01), and homeostasis model of assessment- (β = -1.45, 95% CI -.10 to -0.80, P < .001), and significantly increased the quantitative  sensitivity check index (β = 0.01, 95% CI 0.007-0.02, P < .001) compared with placebo treated subjects. In addition, melatonin administration resulted in a significant reduction in serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (β = -1.92 mg/L, 95% CI -3.02 to -0.83, P = .001) and plasma malondialdehyde (β = -0.21 μmol/L, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.06, P = .005); also, significant rises in plasma total antioxidant capacity (β = 253.87 mmol/L, 95% CI 189.18-318.56, P < .001) and nitric oxide levels (β = .99 μmol/L, 95% CI 0.71-5.28, P = .01) were observed compared with the placebo.Overall, melatonin supplementation for 12 weeks to diabetic HD patients had beneficial effects on mental health, glycemic control, inflammatory markers, and oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

Atherosclerosis and  contribute to the development of the diseases, and subclinical inflammation is observed in both conditions. There are many proofs about the connection between epigenetic factors and different diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Interestingly, recent studies show that at least some anti-diabetic drugs, as well as blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), exert epigenetic effects aside from their hypoglycemic and antihypertensive functions, respectively. More studies are needed to discover other positive effects of the medications established through epigenetic mechanisms and to find out more about the epigenetic role in the development of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611602>Adipocyte PU.1 knockout promotes  sensitivity in HFD-fed obese mice.</a></h1><p> is a key feature of obesity and type  diabetes. PU.1 is a master transcription factor predominantly expressed in macrophages but after HFD feeding PU.1 expression is also significantly increased in adipocytes. We generated adipocyte specific PU.1 knockout mice using adiponectin cre to investigate the role of PU.1 in adipocyte biology,  and glucose homeostasis. In HFD-fed obese mice systemic glucose tolerance and  sensitivity were improved in PU.1 AKO mice and clamp studies indicated improvements in both adipose and liver  sensitivity. At the level of adipose tissue, macrophage infiltration and inflammation was decreased and glucose uptake was increased in PU.1 AKO mice compared with controls. While PU.1 deletion in adipocytes did not affect the gene expression of PPARg itself, we observed increased expression of PPARg target genes in eWAT from HFD fed PU.1 AKO mice compared with controls. Furthermore, we observed decreased phosphorylation at serine 273 in PU.1 AKO mice compared with fl/fl controls, indicating that PPARg is more active when PU.1 expression is reduced in adipocytes. Therefore, in obesity the increased expression of PU.1 in adipocytes modifies the adipocyte PPARg cistrome resulting in impaired glucose tolerance and  sensitivity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665140>Impact of macronutrient supplements for children born preterm or small for gestational age on developmental and metabolic outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Nutritional supplements may improve development of infants born small (preterm or small for gestational age [SGA]) but may increase the risk of later metabolic disease. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of macronutrient supplements for infants born small on later development and metabolism.We searched OvidMedline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception to April 1, 2019, and controlled-trials.com, clinicaltrials.gov, and anzctr.org.au. Randomised or quasirandomised trials were included if the intention was to increase macronutrient intake to improve growth or development of infants born small and assessed post-discharge outcomes. Co-primary outcomes were cognitive impairment and metabolic risk, evaluated in toddlers (<3 years), childhood (3 to 8 years), and adolescence (9 to 18 years). Two reviewers independently extracted data. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and data were pooled using random-effect models. Twenty-one randomised and one quasirandomised trial of variable methodological quality involving 3,680 infants were included. In toddlers born small, supplementation did not alter cognitive impairment (relative risk [RR] 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67 to 1.49; P = 0.99), and there were no differences in cognitive scores (mean difference [MD] 0.57; 95% CI -0.71 to 1.84; P = 0.38) or motor scores (MD 1.16; 95% CI -0.32 to .65; P = 0.12) between supplemented and unsupplemented groups. However, fewer supplemented children had motor impairment (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94; P = 0.01). In subgroup analyses, supplementation improved cognitive scores in boys (MD 5.60; 95% CI 1.07 to 10.14; P = 0.02), but not girls born small (MD -.04; 95% CI -7.04 to .95; P = 0.42), and did not alter cognitive or motor scores in the subgroup of children born SGA. In childhood, there was no difference in cognitive impairment (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.26 to .57; P = 0.72) or cognitive scores (MD 1.02; 95% CI -1.91 to 3.95; P = 0.50) between supplemented and unsupplemented groups. There were also no differences in blood pressure, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations (all P > 0.05). However, supplemented children had lower fasting glucose (mmol/L: MD -0.20; 95% CI -0.34 to -0.06; P = 0.005) and higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations (mmol/L: MD 0.11; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.19; P = 0.02). In subgroup analyses, there was no evidence of differences in blood pressure between supplemented and unsupplemented groups in boys or girls born small, or in SGA children. In adolescence, there was no difference between supplemented and unsupplemented groups in blood pressure, triglycerides, LDL and HDL concentrations, fasting blood glucose, , and fasting  concentrations (all P > 0.05). Limitations include considerable unexplained heterogeneity, low to very low quality of the evidence, and limited data beyond early childhood.In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials, we found no evidence that early macronutrient supplementation for infants born small altered later cognitive function, although there was some evidence that supplementation may decrease motor impairment in toddlers. Contrary to the findings from observational studies, evidence from randomised trials suggests that early macronutrient supplementation for infants born small improves some metabolic outcomes in childhood.CRD42019127858.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654570>Fibroblast growth factor 21 protects against lipotoxicity-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction via regulation of AMPK signaling and lipid metabolism.</a></h1><p>Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is known as a potent metabolic regulator but its protective mechanisms against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis remain elusive. Here, we aimed to examine the regulatory pathways whereby FGF21 mediates islet lipid metabolism in lipotoxicity-treated cells and animal models. Rat β-cell line (INS-1E cells) and islets isolated from C57/BL6J mice were exposed to palmitic acid (PA) with/without FGF21, mimicking lipotoxic conditions. Resultant  secretion and intracellular signaling were analyzed with Western blotting and RNA-seq. C57/BL6J and global FGF21 knockout (KO) mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce lipotoxicity and given with a long-acting mimetic of FGF21.  and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced lipid accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated  secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation and reduced lipid deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell lipid accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

This study assessed the trend of esophageal cancer mortality in Serbia.A population-based study analyzing esophageal cancer mortality in Serbia in the period 1991-2015 was carried out based on official data. The annual percentage of change (APC), with the 95% confidence interval (CI), was computed using the joinpoint regression analysis. The age, period and birth cohort effects on the mortality from esophageal cancer were examined using the age-period-cohort analysis.In Serbia, esophageal cancer mortality trend significantly increased from 1991 to 2015 in men (APC=+0.9%, 95%CI=0.3 to 1.4), but nonsignificantly increased in women (APC=+0.4%, 95%CI=-0.6 to 1.4). The age-specific mortality rates were increasing with age, but this trend has only been significant in men in the 50-59 years age group (APC = +1.5%, 95%CI= 0.8 to .3). The age-period-cohort analysis suggested statistically non-significant period and cohort effects, and local drifts for both genders (p>0.05 for all).The trend of esophageal cancer mortality should be elucidated in future analytical epidemiological studies in Serbia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620350>Metabolic profile and prolactin serum levels in men with type  diabetes mellitus: Old-new rubric.</a></h1><p>Prolactin (PRL) is involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism since high PRL serum levels are associated with low incidence of type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the metabolic effects of PRL on glucose homeostasis in men with T2DM.Eighty male patients with T2DM compared with 25 male healthy controls matched with patients for age and weight were divided into four groups: Group (A): patients with T2DM on metformin ( = 29), Group (B): patients with T2DM on glyburide ( = 30), Group (C): patients with T2DM on glyburide plus metformin ( = 21), and Group (D): healthy male subjects as control ( = 25). Body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure measurements were determined. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, atherogenic index, fasting serum ,  (IR), and β-cell function of the pancreas were determined by homeostatic model assessment- (HOMA-IR). Furthermore, C-reactive protein and PRL serum level were determined in patients with T2DM and healthy control men.BMI of T2DM patients was higher as compared with control ( = 0.003). Combination therapy (glyburide plus metformin) in patients with T2DM showed better effect on most of glycemic indices and lipid profile than glyburide or metformin monotherapy ( < 0.05). PRL serum level was higher in patients with T2DM as compared with control ( = 0.001). PRL serum level was high in glyburide-treated patients as compared with metformin-treated patients ( = 0.002).This study concludes that elevated PRL serum level in patients with T2DM is associated with diabetic complications. Diabetic pharmacotherapy mainly metformin reduced PRL serum level in patients with T2DM through amelioration of IR.Copyright: © 2019 International Journal of Critical Illness and Injury Science.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621728>Effects of theabrownin on serum metabolites and gut microbiome in rats with a high-sugar diet.</a></h1><p>Evidence has proven that the gut microbiota is an important environmental factor contributing to obesity by altering host energy harvest and storage. We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the obesity-associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of deoxycholic acid, cholic acid, 1H-indole-3-acetic acid, 3-indole acrylic acid and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. -Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic acid, l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the body weight and triglycerides and improved  mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on. A strong correlation between cecal microorganisms and serum metabolites, obesity and  was observed.

We investigated if prevailing serum 25-OH vitamin D might predict the body fat loss in a group of obese adolescents undergoing a residential weight loss program.In 92 (35 male) obese adolescents (aged 10.6 to 19 years) undergoing a residential weight loss program in Belgium, fasting serum 25-OH vitamin D (25-OH-D), , glucose and lipid levels were measured and body composition was assessed by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA).Baseline median (range) serum 25-OH-D level was 17.7 µg/L (3.8 - 41.8). In total, 55 adolescents had a serum 25-OH-D below 20 µg/L. In 31 adolescents with a low baseline 25-OH-D level, median increase in serum 25-OH-D was .4 µg/L (-4. - 7.) after 10 months. This resulted in normal 25-OH-D levels in seven adolescents, whereas median BMI decreased with 1.0 SDS and body fat percentage diminished with 9.9%. Obese adolescents with or without a 25-OH-D level below or above 20 µg/L at baseline had similar changes in body weight, BMI SDS, body fat percentage and body fat mass at the end of the program. The change in serum 25-OH-D did not correlate with change in serum , BMI SDS or body fat percentage and body fat mass.Vitamin D deficiency was present in 55 out of 92 obese adolescents at the start of the summer.

Our recent study showed crucial role of adiponectin in the regulation of testicular functions, and the circulating level of adiponectin declines in diabetes. The current study thus aimed to examine the efficacy of adiponectin in improving testicular dysfunction in high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced T2D mice. T2D was induced in pre-pubertal mice fed with high-fat diet for ∼10 weeks followed by single treatment of streptozotocin. T2D mice showed presence of increased body mass, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, , increased oxidative stress, and declined serum testosterone compared to vehicle-treated control mice. The spermatogenic, steroidogenic, metabolic, and antioxidative parameters were evaluated in T2D mice treated with adiponectin for both two and four weeks. The exogenous administration of adiponectin to T2D mice showed enhanced serum testosterone and expression of testicular steroidogenic markers proteins,  receptor and GLUT8 proteins, increase in intra-testicular concentrations of glucose and lactate and activity of LDH and antioxidant enzymes compared to the levels in untreated T2D mice. This suggests that treatment of adiponectin effectively improves testicular functions by increasing expression of  receptor-mediated increased transport of energy substrate (glucose and lactate) and a marked reduction in oxidative stress are the possible mechanism by which adiponectin effectively improves testicular function in T2D mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Not only that organizations, such as the world health organization (WHO) have identified high blood pressure as one of the main risk factors of the cardiometabolic syndrome, but there is also a link between the occurrence of /impaired glucose tolerance and hypertension that would consequently lead to type- diabetes (T2D). Hypertension is medicated by various classes of synthetic drugs; however, severe or mild adverse effects have been repeatedly reported. To avoid and reduce these adverse effects, natural alternatives, such as bioactive peptides derived from different sources have drawn the attention of researchers.

Pre- and post-bariatric surgery thyroid function tests and thyroid ultrasonography parameters were compared.Four hundred seventy-two patients were included in the study. Mean weight loss after surgery was 30.7 ± 5.1 kg. TSH levels decreased statistically significantly parallel with weight loss and decreased BMI (p = 0.025) after bariatric surgery. However, no statistically significant change was observed in fT4 or fT3 levels (p > 0.05).

Classic type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were defined using the criteria of American Diabetes Association, Immunology of Diabetes Society and World Health Organization. MetS was defined using Chinese Diabetes Society's criteria. Logistic regression analysis was used to obtain odds ratios (OR) of determinants of MetS.  The overall prevalence of MetS was 66.5%, with the highest prevalence in T2DM (68.1%), followed by those in LADA (44.3%) and T1DM (34.%) ( < 0.05 for all comparisons). After adjustment for traditional risk factors, T2DM had a .8-fold [95% confidence interval (CI): .36-3.37] MetS risk compared with LADA, whereas T1DM had significantly lower OR than LADA (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50-0.92). After further adjustment for , the OR of T2DM vs. LADA was slightly reduced but the OR of T1DM vs. LADA was greatly attenuated to non-significance (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.70-1.33). In addition to types of diabetes, age, gender, geographical residence, education attainment, alcohol consumption and HOMA2-IR were independent determinants of MetS.  MetS was highly prevalent, not only in T2DM but also in T1DM and LADA in Chinese newly diagnosed patients; higher risk of MetS in LADA than in T1DM was partially attributable to higher  in LADA.Copyright © 2019 Li, Cao, Tang, Yan, Zhou, Liu, Ji, Yang and Zhou.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664103>Association of Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone and Thyroid Hormones with Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Euthyroid Children and Adolescents Aged 10-18 Years: A Population-Based Study.</a></h1><p>Recent evidence indicates that low-normal thyroid function test results within the reference ranges may be related to increased cardiometabolic risk factors. The current study aimed to evaluate the relationship between thyroid function using thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) and cardiometabolic risk factors and the clustering of these risk factors (metabolic syndrome) in euthyroid children and adolescents. A total of 250 euthyroid children and adolescents aged 10-18 years were included using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2015. In the unadjusted correlation analyses, TSH was positively correlated with glucose (r = 0.172, P = 0.006), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (r = 0.149, P = 0.018),  (r = 0.144, P = 0.023), homeostatic model assessment for  (HOMA-IR) (r = 0.163, P = 0.010), and triglyceride (TG) (r = 0.155, P = 0.014), whereas FT4 was negatively associated with the waist circumference (WC) standard deviation score (SDS) (r = -0.134, P = 0.035), body mass index (BMI) SDS (r = -0.126, P = 0.046),  (r = -0.219, P < 0.001), and HOMA-IR (r = -0.211, P < 0.001). In the multiple linear regression analysis, TSH was positively associated with glucose (β = 1.179, P = 0.021), HbA1c (β = 0.044, P = 0.039), and TG (β = 8.158, P = 0.041) after adjustment for possible confounders. FT4 was negatively associated with serum fasting  (β = -5.884, P = 0.017) and HOMA-IR (β = -1.364, P = 0.023) in the multiple linear regression analysis. Boys and girls with elevated glucose levels had a higher adjusted mean TSH level compared to those without elevated glucose levels after controlling for confounding factors in the analysis of covariance (.16 mIU/L vs 3.88 mIU/L, P = 0.004). Our results suggest that higher TSH and/or lower FT4 levels, even within the reference ranges, may be related to increased cardiometabolic risk factors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640950>[Effects of glycosylated hemoglobin and disease course on islet β-cell function in patients with type  diabetes].</a></h1><p>To compare islet β-cell function in type  diabetic (T2DM) patients with different glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and diabetes durations.We examined body parameters, biochemical profiles and islet autoantibodies in a total of 803 T2DM patients admitted in the Department of Endocrinology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University between December, 2014 and April, 2016. The patients were stratified by HbA1c level and disease course and underwent steamed bun test to evaluate islet β-cell function and .Linear correlation analysis showed that in T2DM patients, HbA1c level was negatively correlated with HOMA2-IR, HOMA2-%β, DI30 and DI180 (=0.000), and disease course was negatively correlated with HOMA2-IR, HOMA2-% β, and DI180 ( &lt; 0.05). The patients with different HbA1c levels showed significantly different HOMA2-IR, HOMA2-%β, DI30 and DI180 (=0.000); HOMA2-%β, DI30 and DI180 were significantly higher in patients with HbA1c levels &lt; 7.8%, and HOMA2-% β was significantly decreased in patients with HbA1c levels above 9.8%. The patients with different disease courses also had significant differences in HOMA2-IR, HOMA2-%β, DI30, and DI180 (=0.000), and as the disease course extended, DI30 and DI180 tended to decrease progressively. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that HbA1c, diabetes duration, and body mass index (BMI) were all independent factors affecting islet β- cell function in T2DM patients.The secretion function of islet β cells decreases progressively with the increase of HbA1c level or disease course in T2DM patients, but the disease course does not appear to have an effect as strong as that of HbA1c level on islet β cell function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625676>Metabolic response to exercise in childhood brain tumor survivors: A pilot controlled study.</a></h1><p>Survival rates in children diagnosed with malignant brain tumors exceed 70%.

We investigated substrate utilization during submaximal exercise.Ten brain tumor survivors and 10 healthy children were matched by sex, age, and Tanner stage. Participants completed a submaximal incremental exercise test to determine their fat and carbohydrate oxidation rates.The relative oxygen volume (VO ) peak was significantly higher in the control group than in the survivors of childhood brain tumors (43.3 ± 11.9 and 32.4 ± 10. mL/kg /min, P = .04). At the same relative exercise intensity, there was no difference in the carbohydrate or lipid oxidation rate between the two groups, or in the maximal fat oxidation (MFO) rate, or in the heart rate or percentage of VO peak to reach MFO. Healthy children achieved MFO at significantly higher muscular power than did brain tumor survivors (47.9 ± 20.8 and 21.8 ± 9.6 W, P = .003).Because child brain tumor survivors are less physically fit than healthy children, and substrate utilization during submaximal exercise is not different, physical activity should be promoted for child brain tumor survivors.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657237>Midlife women's health consequences associated with polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h1><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common female endocrinopathies.

Few data are available in the direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) era, especially in cirrhotic patients. We prospectively evaluated the long-term effect of DAAs on IR. Patients treated with DAAs between May 2015 and December 2016 in 3 tertiary care centers were recruited. Patients with diabetes were excluded. Biochemical and virological data were collected at baseline, 12/24/48-weeks (W) after the end of therapy (EOT). Presence of IR was defined by a "homeostasis model assessment index for IR" [HOMA-IR]) > .5. Liver fibroscan was performed at baseline, at 24/48W after EOT. 138 patients were enrolled (mean age 58 years, M/F 85/53, GT1 61%, 68.8% cirrhotic). Sixty-eight (94/138) had IR. Patients with IR had significantly higher stiffness than patients without it (23±12 vs. 15±8; p <0.0001). SVR12 was achieved in 135 (98%) patients, and 124 (90%) patients reached the 48W post-EOT. At this time-point, the percentage of patients with IR significantly decreased to 49% (p=0,01). HOMA-IR was significantly lower than baseline (1.8 vs. 3; p<0.001), and this was related to a significant reduction of  level (11.7±6.3 vs 16.4±8.3). High BMI was associated with a significantly lower probability of achieving a non-IR status at 24W (p=0.05) and 48W (p=0.03). IN CONCLUSION: SVR following DAAs led to a significant reduction of IR, even in patients with cirrhosis. Nevertheless, IR can persist after the achievement of SVR, especially in patients with high BMI.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646058>A Case of Treatment  and Complications in a Patient with Stiff Person Syndrome and Cerebellar Ataxia.</a></h1><p>Antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are associated with Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS).A 50-year-old woman presented with symptoms progressed over 9 years, resulting in a cerebellar ataxia and right upper limb tremor.

It is characterized by chronic anovulation leading to menstrual disorders, and increased infertility. The syndrome can also manifest as hirsutism and acne.The aim of the study was to compare, over a duration of 6 months, the effects of drospirenone (DRSP) versus chlormadinone acetate (CMA) containing oral contraceptives (OCs) on clinical, hormonal, and metabolic parameters in 120 PCOS women.120 women with the diagnosis of PCOS according to the Rotterdam 2003 criteria were recruited to the study. All patients were divided to two treatment groups of OCs, containing: 3 mg DRSP/30 mcg EE (ethinylestradiol) (60 patients) and  mg CMA/30 mcg EE (60 patients). Clinical parameters such as hirsutismus and acne were evaluated. Metabolic parameters such as serum , glucose concentration, homeostatic model assessment of , body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also measured. Among hormonal parameters, serum estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free thyroxine were measured.The use of both DRSP- or CMA-containing OCs provided similar positive therapeutic effects with regard to clinical, metabolic, and hormonal parameters. Among clinical parameters, like hirsutismus, after 6 months of continuous OC treatment, a statistically significant improvement was observed in both groups: DRSP (p <  0.0001) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.0001). In addition, significant improvement was showed according to acne lesions both after DRSP (p < 0.0001) and CMA treatments (p < 0.0001). Among glucose,  levels and HOMA-IR, there were statistically significant higher levels in both groups after DRSP (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.05) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.02, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001).

This may result from altered energy metabolism or dietary habits.We hypothesized that a lower intake of BCAAs improves tissue-specific  sensitivity.This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial examined well-controlled T2D patients receiving isocaloric diets (protein: 1 g/kg body weight) for 4 wk. Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake. The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess  signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001). Under clamp conditions, whole-body and hepatic  sensitivity did not differ between diets. After the BCAA- diet, however, the oral glucose sensitivity index was 24% (P < 0.01) and circulating fibroblast-growth factor 21 was 21% higher (P < 0.05), whereas meal-derived  secretion was 28% lower (P < 0.05). Adipose tissue expression of the mechanistic target of rapamycin was 13% lower, whereas the mitochondrial respiratory control ratio was 1.7-fold higher (both P < 0.05). The fecal microbiome was enriched in Bacteroidetes but depleted of Firmicutes.Short-term dietary reduction of BCAAs decreases postprandial  secretion and improves white adipose tissue metabolism and gut microbiome composition.

However, the mechanism of PEP regulated  on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) rats is unclear. The main purpose of the present study was to explore the efficacy and mechanisms of PEP regulated in GDM rats.Then, ELISA assay indicated that the levels of serum RBP4, Hcy, GA and FFA were lower in PEP groups than GDM groups in a dose-dependent manner. TUNEL staining showed that PEP improved the pathological changes and inhibited the cell apoptosis in the pancreatic and placenta tissues, respectively.We found that PEP improved the weight of pregnant rats and fetal rats and the level of blood glucose, blood biochemical index,  in GDM rats. Results from H&E and immunohistochemical analysis found that PEP decreased the expressions of APN and Chemerin. Further, PEP decreased the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and increased the levels of 11β-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase type  (11β-HSD2) and PPARα-TRB3-AKT2-p-FOXO1-GLUT2 signal related to  sensitivity in a dose-dependent manner.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that PEP may be a candidate drug for the treatment of GDM and guide the clinical therapy.AJTR Copyright © 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614723>Liraglutide Treatment Ameliorates Neurotoxicity Induced by Stable Silencing of Pin1.</a></h1><p>Post-translational modulation of peptidylprolyl isomerase Pin1 might link impaired glucose metabolism and neurodegeneration, being Pin1 effectors target for the glucagon-Like-Peptide1 analog liraglutide. We tested the hypotheses in Pin1 silenced cells (SH-SY5Y) treated with -deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) and methylglyoxal (MG), stressors causing altered glucose trafficking, glucotoxicity and protein glycation. Rescue by liraglutide was investigated. Pin1 silencing caused increased levels of reactive oxygen species, upregulated energy metabolism as suggested by raised levels of total ATP content and mRNA of SIRT1, PGC1α, NRF1; enhanced mitochondrial fission events as supported by raised protein expression of FIS1 and DRP1. 2DG and MG reduced significantly cell viability in all the cell lines. In Pin1 KD clones, 2DG exacerbated altered mitochondrial dynamics causing higher rate of fission events. Liraglutide influenced  signaling pathway (GSK3b/Akt); improved cell viability also in cells treated with 2DG; but it did not revert mitochondrial dysfunction in Pin1 KD model. In cells treated with MG, liraglutide enhanced cell viability, reduced ROS levels and cell death (AnnexinV/PI); and trended to reduce anti-apoptotic signals (BAX, BCL2, CASP3). Pin1 silencing mimics neuronal metabolic impairment of patients with impaired glucose metabolism and neurodegeneration.

HOMA-IR levels increased significantly in groups I and II after the intervention. However, this increase in group I was significantly higher than that in group II after the treatment. HOMA-IR levels were controlled in groups III and IV during the intervention. TNF-α decreased significantly in groups II, III, and IV after the intervention. FBS, HbA1c, and lipid profile did not change significantly in total groups after the intervention. It seems that chromium and vitamin D3 co-supplementation are probably effective in controlling HOMA-IR by decreasing TNF-α in T2DM. • Chromium alone and/ or in simultaneous pretreatment with vitamin D3 is more effective than vitamin D3 in controlling HOMA-IR in T2DM. • Chromium and vitamin D3 alone and/ or in simultaneous pretreatment decrease TNF-α in T2DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672317>Protein intake and amino acid supplementation regulate exercise recovery and performance through the modulation of mTOR, AMPK, FGF21, and immunity.</a></h1><p>Exercise is considered to be the best approach to improve quality of life, and together with a healthy and adequate dietary pattern, exercise represents the best strategy to reduce the risk of chronic metabolic and inflammatory diseases, such as those related to obesity. The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the energy status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by  and amino acid availability, and its metabolic actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing  to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino acid supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; ) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Among 976 identified publications, 20 randomized clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. The initial search was extended to include five studies published between July 2016 and September 2018.Maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, cesarean section, maternal parathyroid hormone and calcium concentrations, and infant gestational age, birth weight, and birth length.Mean differences, odds ratios, and 95% CIs were calculated, only for the initial search, using separate random-effects meta-analyses for each outcome.Evidence was good or strong that maternal vitamin D supplementation significantly increased maternal (13 studies, n=18, mean difference, 14.1 ng/mL [35. nmol/L]; 95% CI=9.6-18.6 ng/mL [24.0-46.4 nmol/L]) and infant (nine studies, n=12; 9.7, 5., 14. ng/mL [24., 12.9, 35.5 nmol/L]) 25(OH)D concentrations, although heterogeneity was significant (I=95.9% and I=97.4, respectively, P<0.001). Evidence was fair that vitamin D supplementation significantly decreases maternal homeostatic model assessment- (five studies, n=7; -1.1, -1.5, -0.7) and increases infant birth weight (nine studies, n=11, 114., 63.4, 165.1 g), both had insignificant heterogeneity. A null effect of maternal supplementation on other maternal (preeclampsia, cesarean section) and infant (gestational age, birth length) outcomes was found.Results show vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy improves maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations and may play a role in maternal  and fetal growth. To further inform practice and policies on the amount of vitamin D, which supports a healthy pregnancy, high quality dose-response randomized clinical trials, which assess pregnancy-specific 25(OH)D thresholds, and appropriately powered clinical outcomes are needed.Copyright © 2019 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Studies have indicated, however, that the onset of NAFLD occurs during pre-diabetes, a condition that often precedes the onset of T2DM. Oleanolic acid has been reported to improve glucose homeostasis in diet-induced pre-diabetes; however, the effects of this triterpene on liver function have not been evaluated.This study was aimed at evaluating the therapeutic effects of oleanolic acid (OA) on selected markers of NAFLD in a pre-diabetes rat model.Pre-diabetes was induced by exposing Sprague Dawley rats to a high-fat high-carbohydrate diet for 20 weeks. The pre-diabetic rats were then treated with OA (80 mg/kg) or metformin (500 mg/kg) in the presence and absence of dietary interventions for a period of 12 weeks. The effects of OA were evaluated on parameters including plasma triglycerides (TGs), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, bilirubin, AST, ALT, SREBP and antioxidant profile while the livers were collected for histological analysis.The findings of this study showed that the administration of OA to pre-diabetic rats ameliorated body/liver weights ratio and significantly decreased plasma triglycerides (TGs) and VLDL. Furthermore, OA also ameliorated hepatic oxidative stress, lowered the SREBP expression and intrahepatic TGs. In addition, OA administration decreased plasma concentrations of bilirubin and liver damage enzyme biomarkers.The findings of the study suggest that OA ameliorates the risk of developing pre-diabetes-related NAFLD through the prevention of intrahepatic fat accumulation while also lowering hepatic inflammation.© 2019 Gamede et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599244>Fasting Serum Glucose Level in Male Cigarette Smoker.</a></h1><p>Cigarette smoking is a practice in which tobacco (leaf of Nicotina Tabacum) is burned and the smoke (heterogeneous aerosol) is tasted or inhaled. Smoking may be linked to  that leads to impaired glucose and lipid metabolism.

This comparative study was carried out in the Department of Physiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from July 2013 to June 2014. One hundred healthy male subjects (75 male were cigarette smokers as study group and 25 male were non smokers as control group) aged between 16 to 40 years were enrolled in this study. Fasting serum glucose was estimated by GOD-PAP Method. Data were expressed as mean±SD and statistical significance of difference among the group was calculated by unpaired students''t' test. The mean±SD fasting serum glucose (FSG) levels were higher in smoker group in comparison to the non smoker group. There were gradual increases in FSG levels in the smokers as the duration of smoking was increased and these were 4.75±0.88, 5.12±0.67, 5.29±0.47 and 5.58±.05mmol/L in group I, IIA, IIB and IIC respectively.

GH promotes anabolic action in all tissues except adipose, where it catabolizes stored fat to release energy for the promotion of growth in other tissues. However, chronic stimulation of lipolysis by GH results in an increased flux of free fatty acids (FFAs) into systemic circulation. Hence, a sustained release of high levels of GH contributes significantly to the development of  by antagonizing the anti-lipolytic action of . The molecular pathways associated with the lipolytic effect of GH in adipose tissue however, remain elusive. Recent studies have provided molecular insights into GH-induced lipolysis and impairment of  signaling.

Clinical evidences have demonstrated that depletion of serum Mg increases exponentially with the duration of type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Diabetes is associated with low Mg, and hypomagnesemia is associated with , inflammation, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease. In subjects at high risk of inflammation and , supplementation of Mg alone ameliorates both phenotypes, slowing the development and progression of hepatic steatosis. We analyze the relationship between serum Mg levels and the onset of T2DM in a large cohort of well-characterized adult white individuals participating in the CATAMERI study, who were reexamined after a mean follow-up of 5.6 ± 0.9 years. In our analysis we acquired a significant negative correlation between Mg levels, fasting glucose, and 2h-post load glucose in subjects who underwent an OGTT. Moreover, Mg levels correlated negatively with fasting  levels, and positively with the lipid profile. As for the detrimental effect of lower circulating Mg levels, our data revealed a significant reduction of T2DM risk of about 20% for each 1 mg/dL increase of circulating Mg. The present results are consistent with the theory that Mg supplementation could ameliorate  sensitivity reducing the risk to develop T2DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672670>Metabolic Syndrome: A Major Risk Factor for Morbidity & Mortality in Severely Injured Trauma Patients.</a></h1><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) increases cardiovascular risk and is associated with poor patient outcomes. We hypothesized that MetS confers an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in severely injured trauma patients.We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients from 2014 through 2018, excluding patients <16 years of age, ISS <16, and with incomplete height and/or weight documentation. MetS was defined as the presence of diabetes, hypertension, and a BMI ≥30 kg/m. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), complications, discharge location, and mortality.There were 4,491 patients meeting criteria of which 100 (.%) had MetS. Patients with MetS were older (64.0 vs 38.6 years, p<.0001) but similar in ISS (22 vs 22, p=.70). Hospital LOS was significantly longer with MetS (16.5 vs 11 days, p <.0001) as was ICU LOS (9 vs 5 days, p=.0002). MetS correlated with higher rates of AKI (19% vs 3.6%,p<.0001), ARDS (11.0% vs 4.6%, p=.01), cardiac arrest (10.0% vs 4.0%, p=.01), MI (.0% vs 0.3%, p=.05), severe sepsis (8.0% vs 3.3%, p=.03), unplanned intubation (11.0% vs 5.0%, p=.02), unplanned ICU admission (13.0% vs 6.1%, p=.02), and non-home discharge (51.0% vs 30.%, p=.0007). After controlling for age, GCS, ISS, gender, and mechanism, MetS remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR .5, 95% CI 1.33-4.7, p=.004).MetS occurs infrequently in our severely injured trauma population but is strongly associated with increasing LOS as well as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, and renal complications. MetS also significantly and independently predicts death and should be identified early to facilitate prompt multidisciplinary treatment.Copyright © 2019.

However, researches on the impact of isoflurane on -related metabolism in the central nervous system, especially in type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are scarce. This study sought to explore whether isoflurane anesthesia had a negative effect on  sensitivity both in peripheral and central tissues. Moreover, the possible role of isoflurane anesthesia in T2DM mice with pre-existing IR was analyzed. T2DM model in C57BL/6J mice was established by high fat diet (HFD) and single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg). Both HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice and normal mice received 6 h isoflurane exposure. Blood glucose level and serum  concentration were detected and the homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) index was calculated to estimate peripheral IR. Relative levels of genes and proteins in the -dependent signaling pathway in mouse prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were determined to measure central IR. Results indicated that 6 h isoflurane exposure induced hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and raised HOMA-IR index. Meanwhile, phosphorylated  receptor substrate-1 (pIRS1) (Ser639) and phosphorylated  receptor substrate- (pIRS2) (Ser731) were upregulated, while phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) (Ser473) and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (pGSK3β) (Ser9) were downregulated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of anesthetized mice. Notably, isoflurane anesthesia significantly aggravated the degree of central IR in the aspects of gene transcriptions and protein expressions in HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice with pre-existing IR. This study suggested that isoflurane anesthesia induced peripheral and central IR and aggravated pre-existing  in T2DM mice.Copyright © 2019.

Iron metabolism is impaired in obese individuals and iron deficiency has been associated with physical inactivity. We investigated whether iron bioavailability is reduced in patients with NAFLD and contributes to reduced cardiorespiratory fitness.We collected information on weight-adjusted, submaximal physical work capacity (PWC), ultrasound-determined hepatic steatosis, iron indices, and hematologic and metabolic parameters from 390 female and 458 male participants of the Raine Study-a longitudinal study of disease development in 2868 children in Western Australia. X and linear regression analyses were used to compare characteristics of study participants according to NAFLD status at age 17 years.Fourteen percent of the cohort had NAFLD. PWC was significantly reduced in adolescents with NAFLD compared to adolescents without NAFLD (reduction of 0.17 W/kg, P=.0003, adjusted for sex and body mass index [BMI]). Iron bioavailability (assessed by mean corpuscular volume [MCV], mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH], transferrin saturation, and serum levels of iron) was inversely correlated with BMI in adolescents with NAFLD (P≤.01 for all, adjusted for sex) but not in adolescents without NAFLD (P>.30). MCV and MCH correlated with PWC (MCV, P=.002 for female and P=.0003 male participants; MCH, P=.004 for female and P=.01 for male participants), irrespective of NAFLD status. Reduced PWC was associated with lower transferrin saturation in adolescents with NAFLD (reduction of 0.012 W/kg per unit decrease in transferrin saturation, P=.007) but not in adolescents without NAFLD (reduction of 0.001 W/kg, P=.40), adjusted for sex. This association was independent of MCV or MCH.In a well-defined cohort of adolescents, we found NAFLD to be associated with decreased cardiorespiratory fitness, independent of BMI. The relationship between transferrin saturation and PWC in adolescents with NAFLD indicates that functional iron deficiency might contribute to reductions in cardiorespiratory fitness.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Epicardial adipose tissue, the visceral fat of the heart, has emerged as a new cardiometabolic risk marker because of its close anatomical proximity to the myocardium and coronary artery. This study aimed to evaluate epicardial fat thickness (EFT) in children with subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) and its relation to early atherosclerotic changes.The study included 32 children with SH due to autoimmune thyroiditis and 32 healthy children matched for age and gender as control group. Patients and controls underwent anthropometric evaluation and measurement of fasting lipids, glucose, , homeostasis model assessment for  and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). TSH, free thyroxine (FT4 and FT3) and antithyroid autoantibodies (antithyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies) were also measured. Conventional echo-cardiography was used to assess EFT. Noninvasive ultrasound was used to measure carotid intima-media thickness and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) responses.Compared to controls, patients had higher atherogenic index (AI) and hs-CRP (p = 0.001 for each). Conventional echocardiography revealed that patients with SH had higher EFT (p = 01) and significantly lower FMD response compared with the control (p = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, EFT values were significantly correlated with TSH (OR 1.; 95% CI 1.04-1.34; p = 0.01), hs-CRP (OR 1.1; 95% CI 1.09-1.14; p = 0.001, AI (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.17-.03; p = 0.001), and FMD response (OR .4; 95% CI 1.14-.53; p = 0.01).Our study demonstrated that EFT is higher in children with SH compared with controls and associated with FMD responses.

This study is to evaluate the association of the three cytokines and glucose homeostasis.This was a cross-sectional study of children with obesity ranging from 5 to 14 years compared to age- and sex-matched children of normal weight. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), oral glucose tolerance test -hour plasma glucose (OGTT2hPG), and  (INS) were measured, and serum adropin, GLP2, and ANGPTL4 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The body mass index (BMI), BMI-Z scores, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) were calculated.Thirty-nine children (9.70 ± 1.71 years, 18 females) with obesity and 29 normal weight children (8.98 ± 1.98 years, 16 females) were assessed. The levels of INS, HOMA-IR and GLP2 of the obesity group were significantly higher than the controls (P < 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed that serum GLP2 was positively associated with WHR, FPG, and OGTT2hPG, and adropin was negatively associated with BMI, BMI-Z, WHR, INS, and HOMA-IR (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, GLP2 were negatively associated with adropin and ANGPTL4 (both P < 0.05). By binary logistic regression, adropin and GLP2 were found to be independent markers of obesity. Multiple linear regression showed that GLP2 was associated with OGTT2hPG, and adropin was associated with INS and HOMA-IR (all P < 0.05).Obese children had elevated GLP2 concentrations, and adropin and GLP2 associated with both childhood obesity and glucose homeostasis.

Thus, the objective of the present study was to investigate whether and how oral administration of the ethanolic extract of  leaves (LECS) improves glucose and  homoeostasis, liver damage, and endothelial dysfunction in an experimental model of type  diabetes, the leptin-deficient  mice. Oxidative stress and protein expression of -dependent and  -independent signaling pathways were studied. Obese  ) vs. control () mice were treated daily with intragastric administration of either vehicle or LECS (200 mg/kg, per day) for 4 weeks. Fasting blood glucose, body weight, food intake, glucose and  tolerance, oxidative stress, and liver damage as well as vascular complications with respect to endothelial dysfunction were examined. Administration of LECS in obese mice significantly reduced blood glucose and  levels, improved glucose tolerance and  sensitivity, and restored the increase of circulating AST and ALT without modification of body weight and food intake. These effects were associated with increased activity of both  and AMPK pathways in the liver and skeletal muscles. Of particular interest, administration of LECS in obese mice completely prevented the endothelial dysfunction resulting from an increased NO and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the aorta. Altogether, oral administration of LECS remarkably attenuates features of type  diabetes on glucose, hepatic inflammation, , endothelial function, and vascular oxidative stress, being as most of these effects are related to -dependent and -independent mechanisms.

In this study, we have identified three novel mutations in the IRS1 gene of type  diabetic (T2D) patients, which reflected in the amino acid changes as I65S, R66S, and G86R in the phosphotyrosine binding domain of the IRS1 protein. The impact of these mutations on the structure and function of the IRS1 protein was evaluated through molecular modeling studies, and distinct conformational fluctuations were recorded. The variable binding affinities and positional displacement of these mutant models were observed in the ligand-binding cleft of IR. The mutant IRS1 models triggered conformational changes in the L1 domain of IR upon their binding.

An inverse association between body height and -hour postload plasma glucose (2hPG) has been demonstrated. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between body surface area (BSA) and plasma glucose values during an OGTT.An OGTT was performed on 2659 individuals at increased cardiovascular risk aged between 45 and 70 years of age, who had not previously been diagnosed with diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Their BSA was calculated according to the Mosteller formula. Study subjects were divided into five BSA levels corresponding to 12.5, 25, 25, 25, and 12.5% of the total distribution.When adjusted for age, sex, waist circumference, alcohol intake, current smoking, and leisure-time physical activity, BSA level showed an inverse linear relationship with the 2hPG in all categories of glucose tolerance (p for linearity < 0.001). Moreover, the smaller the adjusted BSA of the study person, the higher the proportion of newly diagnosed type  diabetes based on 2hPG in the OGTT.Body size has a considerable impact on the findings from a standardized OGTT. Smaller persons are more likely to be diagnosed as glucose intolerant than relatively larger sized individuals.This work was supported by the State Provincial Office of Western Finland, the Central Satakunta Health Federation of Municipalities, Satakunta Hospital District, and the Hospital District of Southwest Finland.Evidence before this study. We searched PubMed using the MeSH terms "glucose tolerance test", "body surface area", "body height", "body size", "glucose tolerance", "", "blood glucose" and "diabetes mellitus" on March 10, 2019 without language restrictions. We also used Cited Reference Search in Web of Science for relevant articles. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is standardized globally with a uniform glucose load of 75 g to all adults irrespective of body size. An inverse association between body height and -hour postload plasma glucose (2hPG) has been demonstrated. Several studies have shown that 2hPG predicts all-cause mortality better than elevated fasting glucose. However, body height or body surface area are not usually adjusted in epidemiological studies. It is well known that short adult stature is a risk factor for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Added value of this study. This is the first study to assess the relationship of body surface area and 2hPG in a typical primary care population at increased cardiovascular risk. Body surface area has a considerable impact on the result of a standardized OGTT. Smaller individuals are more likely to be diagnosed as glucose intolerant than relatively larger sized individuals. Implications of all the available evidence. There is a possibility that the diagnosis of type  diabetes made by an OGTT is a false positive result in a relatively small individual, and a false negative result in a relatively larger individual. Association of 2hPG concentrations and mortality may be influenced by body size as confounding factor. Given that the OGTT is a time and effort consuming test both for patients and laboratory personnel, validity of the OGTT for different body sizes should be reconsidered.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

There is a relationship between the high activity of this enzyme and the development of obesity and metabolic disorders. The inhibition of 11β-HSD1 has been shown to attenuate the development of type  diabetes mellitus, , metabolic syndrome and other diseases mediated by excessive cortisol production. In this work, fifteen benzothiazole derivatives substituted with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups were designed to explore their affinity for 11β-HSD1 using in silico methods. The results show that (E)-5-((benzo[d]thiazol--ylimino)(methylthio)methylamino)--hydroxybenzoic acid (C1) has good physicochemical properties and favorable interactions with 11β-HSD1 through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the catalytic site formed by Y183, S170 and Y177. Furthermore, C1 was synthesized and evaluated in vitro and ex vivo using clobenzorex (CLX) as a reference drug in obese Zucker rats. The in vitro results showed that C1 was a better inhibitor of human 11β-HSD1 than CLX.

Mechanisms underlying selective hypertrophic growth and tissue remodeling properties of VIS fat are not well understood. We identified subsets of adipose progenitors (APs) unique to VIS fat with differential Cd34 expression and adipogenic capacity. VIS low (Cd34 low) APs are adipogenic, whereas VIS high (Cd34 high) APs are not. Furthermore, VIS high APs inhibit adipogenic differentiation of SUB and VIS low APs in vitro through the secretion of soluble inhibitory factor(s).

Recently, a new score was developed to estimate body fat percentage (relative fat mass, RFM). We aimed to evaluate the value of RFM in predicting the presence and severity of NAFLD, compared with other anthropometric measurements.RFM, body mass index (BMI), and other anthropometric measurements were evaluated in two cohorts of subjects: a cohort from a Portuguese prospective epidemiological study (e_Cor) and morbidly obese patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. We evaluated if RFM and BMI were related with the presence and severity of liver disease, which was assessed by noninvasive tools in the first cohort and by liver histology in the morbidly obese cohort. The independence of relations found in univariate analysis was assessed with multivariable logistic regression analysis.In the general population cohort, 744 subjects (48% male) were enrolled. BMI-defined obesity was present in 23% and RFM-defined obesity in 86%.  (IR) related with BMI-defined obesity (OR 4.37 [.16-8.84]) and weight (OR 1.05 [1.02-1.08]) in men, and waist circumference (WC) (OR 1.07 [1.03-1.11]) in women. Dyslipidemia and hypertension related with RFM-defined obesity in men (OR .96 [1.36-6.47] and OR 5.37 [1.31-22.06], respectively). Ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD in 33% related with weight in men (OR 1.03 [1.003-1.06] and WC in women (OR 1.06 [1.02-1.10]). In men, ALT elevation related with weight (OR 1.04 [1.02-1.07]). In women, advanced fibrosis (estimated by NAFLD Fibrosis Score) associated with BMI-defined obesity (OR 42.43 [3.61-498.13]). In the morbidly obese cohort, 152 subjects were enrolled, of whom 84% were female, 37% had steatohepatitis, and 9.4% had advanced fibrosis. Adiponectin associated inversely and leptin positively with RFM in men. The severity of steatosis increased linearly with BMI and WC in women. Higher BMI associated with steatohepatitis in women and advanced fibrosis in men.RFM-defined obesity better predicted dyslipidemia and hypertension (though not IR) and adipokine imbalance; however, it did not add value to BMI-defined obesity in predicting NAFLD or liver injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673032>Targeting ERβ in Macrophage Reduces Crown-like Structures in Adipose Tissue by Inhibiting Osteopontin and HIF-1α.</a></h1><p>Proinflammatory processes in adipose tissue contribute to development of breast cancer and . Crown-like structures (CLS) are histologic hallmarks of the proinflammatory process in adipose tissue. CLS are microscopic foci of dying adipocytes surrounded by macrophages mostly derived from monocytes in blood. Estrogen receptor β (ERβ) is expressed in microglia, macrophages within the central nervous system (CNS), where it evokes an anti-inflammatory response. The present study investigates the function of ERβ in macrophages within CLS. We report that even though monocytes in the blood have no detectable levels of ERβ, macrophages in CLS do express ERβ. In ERβ-/- mice, there was a significant increase in the number of CLS in both subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). CLS in these mice were dominated by pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1 macrophages) with higher expression of osteopontin (OPN) and an increase in number of proliferating macrophages. In mice made obese by Western diet, treatment with an ERβ selective agonist (LY3201) reduced the number of CLS in both SAT and VAT with downregulation of OPN, activated hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), proliferation and upregulation prolyl hydroxylase  (PHD2), the enzyme which prevents activation of HIF1α, in macrophages. We conclude that ERβ expression is induced in macrophages in CLS within adipose tissue where it plays a pivotal role in suppression of CLS.

Infertile Afrocaribbean (AC) women with PCOS may have metabolic features that could help to better target their management.  To evaluate the characteristics of PCOS in this population and their metabolic profile to target the worst metabolic parameter.  A retrospective study including infertile AC women for 4 years. PCOS was diagnosed using Rotterdam criteria and compared with non-PCOS women referred consecutively for infertility during the same period.  Among 981 AC women evaluated for infertility, PCOS was found in 17%. PCOS women were younger than non-PCOS women. After age and body mass index (BMI) matching, only fasting blood glucose and triglyceride levels were higher in PCOS women compared with non-PCOS women. PCOS was positively correlated with triglyceride levels and negatively with vitamin D levels. PCOS women with obesity had low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and increased triglyceride levels compared with those without obesity. No correlation was found between lipids or glucose levels and androgen levels. Multivariate analysis showed that only triglycerides were independently related to PCOS after adjustment for age and BMI.  In the AC population where the prevalence of obesity and diabetes is increased, the metabolic profile of infertile women with PCOS is mainly characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, with a higher risk of visceral obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Interventional studies would be useful to evaluate the predictive value of hypertriglyceridemia on diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in this population.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664995>CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of SPRY2 in human hepatocytes leads to increased glucose uptake and lipid droplet accumulation.</a></h1><p>The prevalence of obesity and its comorbidities, including type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is dramatically increasing throughout the world; however, the underlying aetiology is incompletely understood. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genec susceptibility loci for obesity and T2DM, although the causal genes and mechanisms are largely unknown. SPRY2 is a candidate gene identified in GWAS of body fat percentage and T2DM, and has recently been linked to  production in pancreatic β-cells. In the present study, we aimed to further understand SPRY2 via functional characterisation in HepG2 cells, an in vitro model of human hepatocytes widely used to investigate T2DM and .CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was used to target SPRY2 in HepG2 cells, and the functional consequences of SPRY2 knockout (KO) and overexpression subsequently assessed using glucose uptake and lipid droplet assays, measurement of protein kinase phosphorylation and RNA sequencing.The major functional consequence of SPRY2 KO was a significant increase in glucose uptake, along with elevated lipid droplet accumulation. These changes were attenuated, but not reversed, in cells overexpressing SPRY2. Phosphorylation of protein kinases across key signalling pathways (including Akt and mitogen activated protein kinases) was not altered after SPRY2 KO. Transcriptome profiling in SPRY2 KO and mock (control) cells revealed a number of differentially expressed genes related to cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle regulation and cellular signalling pathways. Phospholipase A2 group IIA (PLA2G2A) mRNA level was subsequently validated as significantly upregulated following SPRY2 KO, highlighting this as a potential mediator downstream of SPRY2.These findings suggest a role for SPRY2 in glucose and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes and contribute to clarifying the function of this gene in the context of metabolic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600750>Rodent Models of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a continuous diseases spectrum associated with obesity, type  diabetes, , and hyperlipidemia. Simple hepatic steatosis may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), even fibrosis and cirrhosis, and finally hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, NAFLD has become a public health concern with increasing prevalence. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis remain incompletely understood, and few effective therapeutic approaches are available. Summary and Key Messages: A myriad of different rodent models has been developed to elucidate pathophysiology of NAFLD/NASH and guide therapeutic strategy. To date, no single rodent model can display the whole disease spectrum and metabolic features associated with human NASH, but can imitate particular characteristics. In this paper, we review the most commonly used dietary, genetic, and chemical rodent models for NAFLD referring to their advantages and disadvantages. Also, we illustrate the status of latest treatment strategy using various NAFLD rodent models. We hope to provide critical guidance for researchers to select appropriate animal models.© 2019 S.

We investigated the relationship of circulating palmitoleate with  sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in humans.Plasma NEFA concentration and composition were determined in non-diabetic individuals from the Relationship between  Sensitivity and Cardiovascular disease (RISC) study cohort at baseline (n = 1234) and after a 3 year follow-up (n = 924). Glucose tolerance,  secretion and beta cell function were assessed during an OGTT. Whole-body  sensitivity was measured by a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (M/I) and OGTT (oral glucose  sensitivity index [OGIS]). The liver  index was calculated using clinical and biochemical data. Body composition including fat mass was determined by bioelectrical impedance.Circulating palmitoleate was proportional to fat mass (r = 0.21, p < 0.0001) and total NEFA levels (r = 0.19, p < 0.0001). It correlated with whole-body  sensitivity (M/I: standardised regression coefficient [std. β] = 0.16, p < 0.0001), liver  (std. β = -0.14, p < 0.0001), beta cell function (potentiation: std. β = 0.08, p = 0.045) and glucose tolerance ( h glucose: std. β = -0.24, p < 0.0001) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, adiposity and other NEFA. High palmitoleate concentrations prevented the decrease in  sensitivity associated with excess palmitate (p = 0.0001). In a longitudinal analysis, a positive independent relationship was observed between changes in palmitoleate and  sensitivity over time (std. β = 0.07, p = 0.04).We demonstrated that plasma palmitoleate is an independent determinant of  sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals. These results support the role of palmitoleate as a beneficial lipokine released by adipose tissue to prevent the negative effects of adiposity and excess NEFA on systemic glucose metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591634>Dietary berries,  and type  diabetes: an overview of human feeding trials.</a></h1><p>Dietary berries are a rich source of several nutrients and phytochemicals and in recent years, accumulating evidence suggests they can reduce risks of several chronic diseases, including type  diabetes (T2D). The objective of this review is to summarize and discuss the role of dietary berries (taken as fresh, frozen, or other processed forms) on  and biomarkers of T2D in human feeding studies. Reported feeding trials involve different berries taken in different forms, and consequently differences in nutritional or polyphenol composition must be considered in their interpretation. Commonly consumed berries, especially cranberries, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries, ameliorate postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in overweight or obese adults with , and in adults with the metabolic syndrome (MetS). In non-acute long-term studies, these berries either alone, or in combination with other functional foods or dietary interventions, can improve glycemic and lipid profiles, blood pressure and surrogate markers of atherosclerosis. Studies specifically in people with T2D are few, and more knowledge is needed. Nevertheless, existing evidence, although sparse, suggests that berries have an emerging role in dietary strategies for the prevention of diabetes and its complications in adults. Despite the beneficial effects of berries on diabetes prevention and management, they must be consumed as part of a healthy and balanced diet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611265>All about skin manifestations of  and type  diabetes: acanthosis nigricans and acrochordons.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677889>, but not  response, during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is associated to worse histological outcome in obese NAFLD.</a></h1><p>Obese subjects are at high risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and diabetes (T2D) due to  (IR). Since high glucose levels are as toxic as lipids for hepatic metabolism, we hypothesize that altered response to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is associated to more severe NAFLD with significant/advanced liver damage.We studied 90 subjects with morbid obesity (73F/17M, BMI = 43. ± 5,9 kg/m) undergoing bariatric surgery and intraoperative liver biopsy, and measured HbA1c, HOMA-IR (fasting Glucose x /22.5), OGTT glucose and  profile, and calculated OGIS (muscle  sensitivity), hepatic-IR (glucose [AUC] x  [AUC]) during OGTT,  response as ( [dAUC]/glucose [dAUC] or Insulinogenic Index (IGI = (I-I)/(G-G)). Patients were divided in 3 groups according to liver biopsy: A (no-NAFLD, 23%), B (simple steatosis (SS), 53%) and C (NASH, 24%) with similar age, gender and BMI. Diabetes was 0% in no-NAFLD, 13% in SS, 35% in NASH. During OGTT, OGIS decreased from A to C (422 vs 360 vs 338, p < 0.01). Increased  concentrations, HbA1c, HOMA-IR and OGIS, not Hep-IR, were strongly associated to hepatic steatosis (p = 0.03, p = 0.0001 and p = 0.01 respectively). Hepatic fibrosis stage was mild as most of the patients had fibrosis grade-1 (69% vs. 8% no fibrosis) and associated to fasting , HbA1c and HOMA-IR. dAUC-I/dAUC-G was similar in the 3 groups, while only AUC-I was strongly associated to steatosis (r = 0.35, p = 0.005), but not to fibrosis.In morbid obesity indexes of IR, and not of  response, are markers of histological severity of liver disease.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

T2DM is correlated with obesity and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing  sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with energy metabolism and  signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and  receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate  (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and tyrosine 632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and tyrosine 632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to  signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614121>GluT4: A central player in hippocampal memory and brain .</a></h1><p> is now well-established as playing multiple roles within the brain, and specifically as regulating hippocampal cognitive processes and metabolism.

These pathological conditions involve interactions between environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors. Recent advances in nutriepigenomics are contributing to clarify the role of some nutritional factors, including dietary fatty acids in gene expression regulation. This systematic review assesses currently available information concerning the role of the different fatty acids on epigenetic mechanisms that affect the development of chronic diseases or induce protective effects on metabolic alterations.A targeted search was conducted in the PubMed/Medline databases using the keywords "fatty acids and epigenetic". The data were analyzed according to the PRISMA-P guidelines.Consumption fatty acids like n-3 PUFA: EPA and DHA, and MUFA: oleic and palmitoleic acid was associated with an improvement of metabolic alterations. On the other hand, fatty acids that have been associated with the presence or development of obesity, T2D, pro-inflammatory profile, atherosclerosis and IR were n-6 PUFA, saturated fatty acids (stearic and palmitic), and trans fatty acids (elaidic), have been also linked with epigenetic changes.Fatty acids can regulate gene expression by modifying epigenetic mechanisms and consequently result in positive or negative impacts on metabolic outcomes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631000>Influence of post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass weight recidivism on : a 3-year follow-up.</a></h1><p>Although some early metabolic benefits provided by bariatric surgery are known to occur regardless of weight loss, the impact of mid- to long-term weight recidivism after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on metabolic outcomes is not profoundly understood.To investigate the effect of weight recidivism on  among nondiabetic individuals with morbid obesity after RYGB during a 3-year follow-up.Public tertiary university hospital.This is a cohort study based on a prospectively collected database of a public tertiary university hospital, which enrolled individuals with morbid obesity who underwent RYGB and were followed-up for 3 years. Weight loss was classified into the following 3 categories: (1) no weight regain; () expected regain (regain ≤20% of the maximum weight loss); and (3) obesity recidivism (regain >20% of the maximum weight loss). Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) values were compared over time.Of 100 patients, 20% presented obesity recidivism and 52% an expected regain after 3 years of surgery; 28% showed no regain. The recidivism group presented a significant increase in HOMA 3 years after surgery (P = .02). The recidivism group presented a significantly higher HOMA 3 years after surgery than the observed in the other groups (P < .001), as well as a significantly higher percentage of HOMA variation throughout the follow-up (P = .02).Weight recidivism after RYGB was significantly associated with a worsening of  among nondiabetic individuals with morbid obesity.

We used crosslinked hyaluronic acid as the drug delivery vehicle for BPs to ensure that BPs administered at a dose of 30 µg/kg could settle into the prepared hole in rats. Thereafter, implants were inserted into cylindrical holes of a specific size, created parallel to the long axis of the femora. The outcomes of the in vivo study revealed that BPs promoted bone formation, which reversed the reduction in the DM group according to double fluorescence labeling, micro-CT, biomechanical and histomorphometric analyses (P<0.05). Furthermore, intergroup comparisons revealed significant correlation coefficients (P<0.05) between the micro-CT and biomechanical parameters.

PROK2 is also expressed in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) as an essential factor for neuro-and morphogenesis. Since the MOB was shown to be strongly involved in eating behavior, we hypothesized that PROK2 could be a new target in the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis, through its effects in the MOB. We also asked whether PROK2 could be associated with the pathophysiology of obesity, the metabolic syndrome (MetS), and type  diabetes (T2D) in humans.We assessed in wild type mice whether the expression of Prok2 in the MOB is dependent on the nutritional status. We measured the effect of human recombinant PROK2 (rPROK2) acute injection in the MOB on food intake and olfactory behavior. Then, using a lentivirus expressing Prok2-shRNA, we studied the effects of Prok2 underexpression in the MOB on feeding behavior and glucose metabolism. Metabolic parameters and meal pattern were determined using calorimetric cages. In vivo -deoxyglucose uptake measurements were performed in mice after intraperitoneally  injection. Plasmatic PROK2 dosages and genetic associations studies were carried out respectively on 148 and more than 4000 participants from the D.E.S.I.R. (Data from an Epidemiologic Study on the  Syndrome) cohort.Our findings showed that fasting in mice reduced Prok2 expression in the MOB. Acute injection of rPROK2 in the MOB significantly decreased food intake whereas Prok2-shRNA injection resulted in a higher dietary consumption characterized by increased feeding frequency and decreased meal size. Additionally, Prok2 underexpression in the MOB induced  compared to scrambled shRNA-injected mice. In the human D.E.S.I.R. cohort, we found a significantly lower mean concentration of plasma PROK2 in people with T2D than in those with normoglycemia. Interestingly, this decrease was no longer significant when adjusted for Body Mass Index (BMI) or calorie intake, suggesting that the association between plasma PROK2 and diabetes is mediated, at least partly, by BMI and feeding behavior in humans. Moreover, common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in PROK2 gene were genotyped and associated with incident T2D or impaired fasting glycemia (IFG), MetS, and obesity.Our data highlight PROK2 as a new target in the MOB that links olfaction with eating behavior and energy homeostasis. In humans, plasma PROK2 is negatively correlated with T2D, BMI, and energy intake, and PROK2 genetic variants are associated with incident hyperglycemia (T2D/IFG), the MetS and obesity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Its more severe type, namely nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may result in the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) predisposes to NAFLD development and progression via  and hyperglycemia. It has also been reported that the majority of T2DM patients have NAFLD/NASH, thus potentially further increasing their cardiometabolic risk. Current guidelines recommend to screen for NAFLD in all T2DM patients and vice-versa. Lifestyle remains the first-line therapeutic option for NAFLD/NASH. Among antidiabetic drugs, pioglitazone was shown to improve histological features of NASH. More recently, there is an increasing interest regarding the effects of newer anti-diabetic drugs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), sodium glucose cotransporter  inhibitors (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on NAFLD/NASH. The present narrative review considers the up-to-date data on the impact of DPP-4i, SGLT2i, and GLP-1 RAs on biochemical and/or histological markers of NAFLD/NASH. The potential clinical implications of these findings in daily practice are also discussed.

Exercise capacity was similar in men and women (percent predicted peak oxygen [O2] consumption: 66% in women vs 68% in men; P = .38), but women had distinct deficits in components of the O2 pathway, including worse biventricular systolic reserve (multivariable-adjusted analyses: ΔLVEF β = -1.70; SE, 0.86; P < .05; ΔRVEF β = -.39, SE=0.80; P = .003), diastolic reserve (PCWP/CO: β = 0.63; SE, 0.31; P = .04), and peripheral O2 extraction (C(a-v)O2 β=-0.90, SE=0.22; P < .001)).Despite a lower burden of cardiometabolic disease and a similar percent predicted exercise capacity, women with HFpEF demonstrated greater cardiac and extracardiac deficits, including systolic reserve, diastolic reserve, and peripheral O2 extraction. These sex differences in cardiac and skeletal muscle responses to exercise may illuminate the pathophysiology underlying the development of HFpEF and should be investigated further.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651303>Association between plasma adipsin level and mild cognitive impairment in Chinese patients with type  diabetes: a cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>The adipokine adipsin contributes to  (IR), inflammation, and obesity, which are all regarded as high-risk factors for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients with type  diabetes mellitus. This research aimed to uncover the role of adipsin in Chinese type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) population with early cognitive dysfunction and determine whether adipsin contributes to diabetic MCI caused by IR.In our study, 126 patients with T2DM were enrolled. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to assess cognitive impairment. Demographic data and neuropsychological test results were evaluated. Plasma adipsin level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The MCI group (n = 57) presented higher plasma adipsin levels compared with the healthy controls (p = 0.018). After adjustment for educational attainment, and age, begative correlations were found between plasma adipsin levels and MoCA, Mini Mental State Exam, and Verbal Fluency Test scores(r = - 0.640, p < 0.001; r = - 0.612, p < 0.001; r = - 0.288, p = 0.035; respectively). Correlation analysis demonstrated that adipsin levels were significantly positively correlated with fasting C-peptide; homeostasis model of assessment for  (HOMA-IR) (r = 0.368, p < 0.001; r = 0.494, p < 0.001; respectively). Multivariable regression analysis further indicated that high plasma adipsin level was a significant independent determinant of MCI in the Chinese population withT2DM (p = 0.017).Elevated plasma adipsin level was associated with MCI in Chinese T2DM patients. Further large-scale studies should be designed to determine whether adipsin is linked to IR-associated susceptibility to early cognitive decline in T2DM patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627295>Hydroxytyrosol Modulates Adipocyte Gene and miRNA Expression Under Inflammatory Condition.</a></h1><p>Chronic inflammation of the adipose tissue (AT) is a major contributor to obesity-associated cardiometabolic complications. The olive oil polyphenol hydroxytyrosol (HT) contributes to Mediterranean diet cardiometabolic benefits through mechanisms still partially unknown. We investigated HT (1 and 10 μmol/L) effects on gene expression (mRNA and microRNA) related to inflammation induced by 10 ng/mL tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes. At real-time PCR, HT significantly inhibited TNF-α-induced mRNA levels, of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, C-X-C Motif Ligand-10, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, vascular endothelial growth factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, cyclooxygenase-, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, matrix metalloproteinase-, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-1, and glutathione peroxidase, as well as surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and reverted the TNF-α-mediated inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1α, and glucose transporter-4. We found similar effects in adipocytes stimulated by macrophage-conditioned media. Accordingly, HT significantly counteracted miR-155-5p, miR-34a-5p, and let-7c-5p expression in both cells and exosomes, and prevented NF-κB activation and production of reactive oxygen species. HT can therefore modulate adipocyte gene expression profile through mechanisms involving a reduction of oxidative stress and NF-κB inhibition. By such mechanisms, HT may blunt macrophage recruitment and improve AT inflammation, preventing the deregulation of pathways involved in obesity-related diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629469>RAGE/NF-κB pathway mediates hypoxia-induced  in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.</a></h1><p>There is growing evidence in support of an independent association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and type  diabetes, and in which hypoxia may play an important role. Hypoxia is the hallmark feature and the most important pathophysiologic pathway of OSA. Recently, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) was found to be involved in the pathogenesis of  (IR). However, whether RAGE contributes to the IR of adipocytes under hypoxia remains unknown. In the present study, we found that hypoxia reduced glucose consumption and upregulated RAGE expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a time-dependent manner. RAGE knockdown efficiently attenuated hypoxia-induced IR, including inhibiting serine phosphorylation of  receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), increasing the expression of phosphorylated Akt (Ser473), and improving -stimulated glucose uptake. In addition, hypoxia activated nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB). However, RAGE knockdown inhibited hypoxia-induced NF-κB activity in adipocytes. Finally, an NF-κB inhibitor (PDTC) significantly reduced the hypoxia-induced upregulation of RAGE expression and IR. Therefore, this study indicates that the RAGE/NF-κB pathway mediates hypoxia-induced IR in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and suggests that RAGE may be a potential therapeutic target for suppressing IR in OSA.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It has been noted that nearly 50% of all patients undergo the systemic treatment module; however, most of them exhibit drug . In addition, targeted gene therapy has also been used in treatment but has been found to be effective only in patients with a specified molecular profile (or else this might lead to an increased risk of developing resistant mutations). This has led to increasing interest among researchers in finding innovative treatment options. Metformin, a biguanide, has been widely used in treating diabetes. The drug has been reportedly used in cases of hypothesis-generating retrospective population studies of diabetic patients showing reduced incidence of cancer. Metformin helps in reduction of excess  levels that possess various effects on cell signaling and metabolism. Nonetheless, there is need for an in-depth study on its molecular mechanism to fill any existing research gaps.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589129>Mechanism Underlying the Formation of a Cluster of Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h1><p>The concept of metabolic syndrome (MetS) as a cluster of risk factors of type  diabetes and cardiovascular diseases has undergone some evolutionary transformations over the past years. Integrating the autonomic dysfunction into the pathogenesis of MetS creates the possibility of including a range of nosologies affecting treatment and clinical manifestations of pathologies belonging to MetS into the MetS cluster The purpose of this work is to determine the involvement of autonomic dysfunction in the pathogenesis of associated pathological conditions in patients and MetS.A cross-sectional study was conducted. The sample consisted of 158 patients with metabolic syndrome. The patients underwent a physical examination, including BMI; a blood chemistry test with the determination of the hormonal status (, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone); a 24-hour monitoring of blood pressure (BP); an assessment of heart rate variability; studies showing the presence of gastric reflux (рН-measurement) or its damaging impact (endoscopy); men were tested with the IPSS-QOL questionnaire and underwent transrectal ultrasound of the prostate and ultrasound of the bladder.It is revealed that because of MetS, the occurrence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy reaches 37.5%. Some features of gastroesophageal reflux disease in patients with MetS are shown. Regurgitation prevails in the structure of complaints. In case of fibrogastroduodenoscopy, an endoscopy-negative form of the disease occurs in 38%. According to the data of daily pH-measurement, when DeMeester score is high, in the supine position, 25% of time accounts for alkaline reflux (рН > 7). It is found out that young men experience the enlargement of prostate volume and size; according to the IPSS questionnaire, the scores correspond to the initial manifestations of hyperplastic diseases of the prostate gland due to  and normal level of androgens.The paper demonstrates that the autonomic dysfunction of nervous system (on a par with ) is the main link in the development of MetS. This provides the basis for including the mentioned states - cardiac autonomic neuropathy, lower urinary tract symptoms and gastroesophageal reflux disease - into the MetS cluster.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678183>A 28.6-kD small heat shock protein (MnHSP28.6) protects Macrobrachium nipponense against heavy metal toxicity and oxidative stress by virtue of its anti-aggregation activity.</a></h1><p>Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are ATP-independent chaperones and involved into various physiological and stress processes. In the present study, a 28.6-kD sHSP coding gene, MnHSP28.6, was cloned and characterized from the oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense. Tissue distribution analysis via qPCR and western blot revealed that MnHSP28.6 predominantly expressed in muscle. The temporal transcription of MnHSP28.6 in muscle after bacterial challenge, heavy metal exposure and doxorubicin (DOX) injection was investigated by qPCR. The results showed that the expression of MnHSP28.6 were strongly enhanced by both Cd and Cu exposure, as well as DOX injection, but not by bacterial infection. Aggregation assays showed that recombinant MnHSP28.6 could effectively prevent temperature-induced aggregation of citrate synthase, and reduction-induced aggregation of  in vitro. MnHSP28.6 also could protect muscle extracts from heat-induced protein denaturation and superoxide dismutase (SOD) inactivation. Expressing MnHSP28.6 in E. coli conferred host cell impressive protection against HO compared to control. These results suggest a protective role of MnHSP28.6 in maintaining protein homeostasis, preventing aggregation, promoting  to heavy metal and keeping redox balance.Copyright © 2019.

Although genetic factors surrounding the production and clearance of amyloid-β and phosphorylated tau proteins are known to be responsible for a subset of early-onset AD cases, they do not explain the pathogenesis of the far more prevalent sporadic late-onset variant of the disease. It is thus likely that lifestyle and environmental factors contribute to neurodegenerative processes implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Herein, we review evidence that (1) excess sucrose consumption induces AD-associated liver pathologies and brain , () chronic stress overdrives activity of locus coeruleus neurons, leading to loss of function (a common event in neurodegeneration), (3) high-sugar diets and stress promote the loss of neuroprotective sex hormones in men and women, and (4) Western dietary trends set the stage for a lithium-deficient state. We propose that these factors may intersect as part of a "perfect storm" to contribute to the widespread prevalence of neurodegeneration and AD. In addition, we put forth the argument that exercise and supplementation with trace lithium can counteract many of the deleterious consequences associated with excessive caloric intake and perpetual stress. We conclude that lifestyle and environmental factors likely contribute to AD pathogenesis and that simple lifestyle and dietary changes can help counteract their effects.© 2019 S.

The extracts of mulberry leaf suppress inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress, protect the pancreatic β-cells and modulate glucose metabolism in diabetic rats. Our previous studies and others have shown that mulberry leaf extract has excellent therapeutic effects on type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM), however, the underlying mechanism remains to be studied.Skeletal muscle  (IR) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of T2DM. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of Mulberry leaf flavonoids (MLF) in L6 skeletal muscle cells and db/db mice.L6 skeletal muscle cells were cultured and treated with/without MLF for in vitro studies. For in vivo studies, the db/db mice with/without MLF therapy were used.MLF and metformin significantly ameliorated muscle glucose uptake and mitochondrial function in L6 muscle cells. MLF also increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and the expression of PGC-1α, and upregulated the protein levels of m-GLUT4 and T-GLUT4. These effects were reversed by the AMPK inhibitor compound C. In db/db mice, MLF improve diabetes symptoms and . Moreover, MLF elevated the levels of p-AMPK and PGC-1α, raised m-GLUT4 and T-GLUT4 protein expression, and ameliorated mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle of db/db mice.MLF significantly improved skeletal muscle  and mitochondrial function in db/db mice and L6 myocytes through AMPK-PGC-1α signaling pathway, and our findings support the therapeutic effects of MLF on type  diabetes.Copyright © 2019.

Total [<6; ≥6 months] and predominant [<3; ≥3 months] breastfeeding were recalled using questionnaires. Diet were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. DP obtained by factor analysis by principal component were categorized into tertiles of adherence (T1 = reference). Glucose and lipid biomarkers were categorized into tertiles (T1 + T2 = reference). Logistic regression was applied considering minimal sufficient adjustment recommended by directed acyclic graphs.Median (interquartile range) age and BMI were 23.0 (20.0; 28.5) years and 22.6 (20.7; 25.4) kg/m, respectively. Mean ± SD values of glucose, LDL-c and HDL-c were 82.0 ± 9.0, 101.1 ± 29.6 and 54.4 ± 12.4 mg/dL, respectively.

Machine learning applied to high-resolution metabolomics and clinical phenotype data offers a novel framework for developing a NAFLD screening panel in youth. Here, untargeted metabolomics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed on plasma samples from a combined cross-sectional sample of children and adolescents ages -25 years old with NAFLD (n = 222) and without NAFLD (n = 337), confirmed by liver biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging. Anthropometrics, blood lipids, liver enzymes, and glucose and  metabolism were also assessed. A machine learning approach was applied to the metabolomics and clinical phenotype data sets, which were split into training and test sets, and included dimension reduction, feature selection, and classification model development. The selected metabolite features were the amino acids serine, leucine/isoleucine, and tryptophan; three putatively annotated compounds (dihydrothymine and two phospholipids); and two unknowns. The selected clinical phenotype variables were waist circumference, whole-body  sensitivity index (WBISI) based on the oral glucose tolerance test, and blood triglycerides. The highest performing classification model was random forest, which had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94, sensitivity of 73%, and specificity of 97% for detecting NAFLD cases. A second classification model was developed using the homeostasis model assessment of  substituted for the WBISI. Similarly, the highest performing classification model was random forest, which had an AUROC of 0.92, sensitivity of 73%, and specificity of 94%.  The identified screening panel consisting of both metabolomics and clinical features has promising potential for screening for NAFLD in youth. Further development of this panel and independent validation testing in other cohorts are warranted.© 2019 The Authors.

The aim of this review was to summarize information on the association between dietary habits and the risk of developing T2D.We conducted a comprehensive literature search using the PubMed database from its inception to June, 2019. Articles were restricted to those written in English and concerning human subjects. Relevant manuscripts found in the list of references of the retrieved articles were also used in preparation for the review.Animal protein consumption increases the risk of T2D independently of body mass index. Intake of both unprocessed meat and processed meat is strongly and consistently associated with increased risk of developing T2D. In contrast, consumption of high-quality vegetable foods prevents the disease. High-quality plant foods include whole grains, nuts, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. Among less healthy plant-based foods are fruit juices, sweetened beverages, refined grains, potatoes, sweets, and desserts. Carbohydrate-restricted diets that encourage consumption of animal products promote T2D. Low intake of animal products is linked to high educational level so that well-informed individuals tend to consume diets with elevated content of vegetable food. According to the American Dietetic Association, "appropriately planned vegetarian diets including vegan diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases".restricting animal products while increasing healthy plant-based foods intake facilitates T2D prevention. To neutralize worldwide the burden of T2D and its devastating complications, animal products consumption should be limited or discontinued.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

The anti-diabetic drugs thiazolidinediones improve  sensitivity by blocking PPARγ phosphorylation at S273; however, their full agonism on PPARγ also causes significant unwanted side effects. The indole derivative UHC1 displays -sensitizing effect by acting as a partial agonist through the inhibition of PPARγ S273 phosphorylation, but without full agonist-associated side effects; however, its potency leaves much to be desired. Herein we report the design and synthesis of potent indole analogs as partial PPARγ agonists via the structure-activity relationship studies. Our studies revealed that vanillylamine and piperonyl benzylamine at Site 1 are favored to bind PPARγ with either biphenyl or 3-trifluoromethyl benzyl group at Site . In particular, compound WO91A with vanillylamine at Site 1 displays highly potent PPARγ binding affinity (IC = 16.7 nM), over 30-fold more potent than the parental compound UHC1, yet with less side effect-associated transactivation activity.Copyright © 2019.

Methods The wild-type (WT) and TLR2 knockout (TLR2) C57BL/6 male mice, aged 28 days, were selected, with 12 mice in each group. The genotype of each mouse was identified by PCR. After mice were fed with basic diet for 3 months, the glucose tolerance test (GTT) and  test (ITT) were performed. The mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood were stimulated with GM-CSF/IFN-γ and M-CSF/IL-4/IL-13, respectively, to induce differentiation to M1-like and M2-like macrophages. The CD11b, F4/80, CD11c, CD206 and early growth response  (EGR2) were detected by flow cytometry to determine the phenotype of macrophages. The levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 in the culture supernatant of macrophages were detected using ELISA. Results The result of PCR identification was consistent with the genotype of mice. Compared to WT mice, TLR2 mice exhibited the significantly improved glycemic control at 30 min during GTT and the significantly increased  sensitivity at 15 minutes during ITT. The flow cytometry showed that M1 markers decreased and M2 macrophages increased in the TLR2 mice. ELISA showed that the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α significantly decreased in the culture supernatant of M1 macrophages, while the level of IL-10 significantly increased in the culture supernatant of M2 macrophages in TLR2 mice compared with WT mice. Conclusion TLR2 signal has an effect on the polarization of macrophages and makes macrophages tend to switch to M1 phenotype. A higher number of pro-inflammatory factors secreted by M1 macrophages contribute to a low-grade inflammation state in the body, which leads to a decrease in glucose tolerance and  sensitivity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626149>Impact of metabolic syndrome-related factors on the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms in Asian population.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to investigate the metabolic syndrome-related risk factors for the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in healthy men.A total of 4880 healthy men who underwent transrectal ultrasonography at our hospital during routine health examinations were included in this study. Those who had undergone a prior biopsy or surgery for prostate disease, were suspected of having urinary tract infection, or were taking BPH/LUTS or metabolic syndrome medications were excluded. BPH/LUTS was defined as an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) of ≥8 and a prostate volume (PV) of ≥30 cm.The subjects had a mean age of 54.1 years, PV of 29. cm, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 1.20 ng/mL, and IPSS of 9.. The annual PV growth rate was 0.48 cm/year. Age, body mass index (BMI), PSA, basal metabolic rate, apolipoprotein A-1, fasting blood glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were significant predictive factors for PV. Age, PSA, apolipoprotein B, fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, HDL, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were predictors of BPH/LUTS at the initial health examination. A decreased fat mass and LDL level were a significant risk factor for the development of BPH/LUTS within 5 years in men without a BPH/LUTS diagnosis at the initial examination.Metabolic syndrome-related variables were strongly associated with BPH/LUTS and by decreasing fat mass and LDL levels, development of BPH/LUTS could be prevented within 5 years in healthy Korean men.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602216>Sphingosine-1-phosphate induces islet β-cell proliferation and decreases cell apoptosis in high-fat diet/streptozotocin diabetic mice.</a></h1><p>Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has been reported to enhance the function of islet β-cells, providing a potential therapeutic target for diabetes mellitus. In the present study, the effects of S1P on the proliferation and apoptosis of β-cells in type  diabetic mice were investigated. The mice were administered intraperitoneal S1P solution daily at a dose of 20 µg/kg for three weeks. The intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) and homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) index determination were carried out. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the protein expression of , antigen Ki-67 and S1P receptor isoforms (S1PR1/S1PR2/S1PR3) in pancreatic islets. Compared with the diabetic control (DC) group, the IPGTT results and HOMA-IR index in the S1P treatment group were decreased. The islets in the S1P group exhibited higher  immunostaining intensity than the DC group, as well as higher proliferation (P<0.05) and lower apoptosis rates (P<0.05). Positive staining for the S1P receptors S1PR1, S1PR2 and S1PR3 was observed in the cytoplasm and membrane of the islet cells. S1PR1 and S1PR2 proteins showed increased expression in the S1P and DC groups compared with the normal control group (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively), whereas no significant difference was observed in the expression of S1PR3 among these groups. In conclusion, extracellular S1P can induce islet β-cell proliferation and decrease cell apoptosis in diabetic mice. S1P function may be mediated via S1PR1 and S1PR2; therefore, targeting S1P/S1PR signalling pathways may be a novel therapeutic strategy for diabetes mellitus.Copyright: © He et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620935>Quality and quantity of visceral fat tissue are associated with  and survival outcomes after chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.</a></h1><p>Recent studies suggest that the quality and quantity of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) play significant roles in adipocyte function, and are related to .

Factors that either stimulate or inhibit the expression of hcrt/orexin system were also addressed in addition to its link to obesity, and  and glucose metabolism. Hcrt/orexin ligands and receptors have been localized to different parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Hcrt/orexin, orexin 1 and orexin  receptors are also present in body fluids (cerebrospinal fluid, blood) and in the exocrine (pancreas, salivary, lacrimal) as well as endocrine (pancreatic islets, pituitary, adrenal) glands. Several factors including stress, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, glutamate, nicotine, glucose, hypoglycemia stimulate the expression of Hcrt/orexin system, but it is inhibited by ageing, bone morphogenetic protein, hypoxia/hypercapnia, melanocortin receptor accessory protein  and glucagon.

No prospective study has examined exposure to BPA analogs such as bisphenol S (BPS) in relation to incident type  diabetes.We aimed to investigate whether exposure to BPA and BPS, assessed at up to two time points, was associated with the incidence of type  diabetes.We performed a case-cohort study on 755 participants without diabetes at baseline and followed-up over 9 y as part of the French prospective cohort Data from an Epidemiological Study on the  Syndrome (D.E.S.I.R.). BPA-glucuronide (BPA-G) and BPS-glucuronide (BPS-G) were assessed in fasting spot urine samples collected during the health examinations at baseline and 3 y later. Associations with incident diabetes were examined using Prentice-weighted Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders.A total of 201 incident cases of type  diabetes were diagnosed over the follow-up, including 30 in the subcohort. Compared with participants with the lowest average BPA exposure (below the first quartile), participants in the second, third, and fourth quartile groups of exposure had a near doubling of the risk of type  diabetes, with a hazard ratio  .56 (95% CI: 1.16, 5.65), .35 (95% CI: 1.07, 5.15), and 1.56 (95% CI: 0.68, 3.55), respectively. The detection of BPS-G in urine at one or both time points was associated with incident diabetes, with an  .81 (95% CI: 1.74, 4.53).This study shows positive associations between exposure to BPA and BPS and the incidence of type  diabetes, independent of traditional diabetes risk factors. Our results should be confirmed by recent, population-based observational studies in different populations and settings. Overall, these findings raise concerns about using BPS as a BPA substitute. Further research on BPA analogs is warranted. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5159.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620670>Advanced Lipoprotein Analysis Shows Atherogenic Lipid Profile That Improves After Metreleptin in Patients with Lipodystrophy.</a></h1><p>Patients with lipodystrophy have dyslipidemia and . Leptin treatment with metreleptin in lipodystrophy decreases  and lowers triglycerides without changing high-density lipoprotein. Detailed measurement of lipoprotein particles with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can offer insights into cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and lipid metabolism beyond a standard lipid panel. We hypothesized that patients with lipodystrophy would have a more atherogenic lipid profile than controls at baseline, which would be ameliorated with metreleptin treatment.To characterize the lipoprotein profile in patients with lipodystrophy compared with controls and to evaluate effects of metreleptin treatment.Patients with lipodystrophy (N = 17) were studied before and after metreleptin for  weeks and 6 months and compared with 51 -sensitive sex-matched controls.Lipoprotein profiles were measured by NMR with the LP4 deconvolution algorithm, which reports triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles (TRLPs), high-density lipoprotein particles (HDLPs), and low-density lipoprotein particles (LDLPs).Patients with lipodystrophy had elevated large TRLPs and smaller HDLPs and LDLPs compared with controls. Five patients with lipodystrophy had chylomicrons, compared with zero controls. Metreleptin decreased the size and concentration of TRLPs, eliminated chylomicrons in all but one patient, decreased LDLPs, and increased LDLP size. Metreleptin treatment did not have major effects on HDLPs.Patients with lipodystrophy had an atherogenic lipoprotein profile at baseline consistent with elevated CVD risk, which improved after metreleptin treatment. The presence of fasting chylomicrons in a subset of patients with lipodystrophy suggests saturation of chylomicron clearance by lipoprotein lipase.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Endocrine Society 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600210>Plasma mitochondrial DNA is elevated in obese type  diabetes mellitus patients and correlates positively with .</a></h1><p>Cells damaged by mechanical or infectious injury release proinflammatory mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments into the circulation.

Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type  diabetes, in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and -mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human obesity, and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte metabolism. In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed 5-fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in obesity, reduced levels after surgery-induced weight loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate measures of  (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte ipolysis and  signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.5--fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in obesity and , which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We analyzed data from 2239 hypertensive patients using descriptive statistics and supervised machine learning algorithms, including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and random forest classifier, to select the most relevant features of NASH.  The prevalence of NASH among our hypertensive patients was 11.3%. In univariate analyses, it was associated with metabolic syndrome, type  diabetes, , and dyslipidemia. Ferritin and serum  were the most relevant features in the final model, with a sensitivity of 70%, specificity of 79%, and area under the curve of 0.79.  Ferritin and  are significant predictors of NASH. Clinicians may use these to better assess cardiovascular risk and provide better management to hypertensive patients with NASH.

Exposure to DEHP impairs the function of islet beta cells (INS-1 cells), which is related to  and type  diabetes. At present, some research data have also confirmed that MEHP has a certain damage effect on INS-1 cells. In our experiment, we found that MEHP would lead to the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the upregulation of autophagy. And downregulated ROS production by -acetyl-l-cysteine could also reduce autophagy. In addition, MEHP-induced lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) subsequently released cathepsin D. Additionally, MEHP induced the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and release of cytochrome . Addition of autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine relieved MEHP-induced apoptosis as assessed by the expression of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 9, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, indicating that MEHP-induced apoptosis was autophagy dependent. Cathepsin D inhibitor, pepstatin A, suppressed MEHP-induced mitochondria release of cytochrome  and apoptosis as well. Meanwhile, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a new B vitamin, improved the above phenomenon. Taken together, our results indicate that MEHP induces autophagy-dependent apoptosis in INS-1 cells by lysosomal-mitochondrial axis. PQQ improved this process by downregulating ROS and provided a degree of protection. Our study provides a new perspective for MEHP on the cytotoxic mechanism and PQQ protection in INS-1 cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609422>High-fat overfeeding does not exacerbate rapid changes in forearm glucose and fatty acid balance during immobilization.</a></h1><p>Physical inactivity and high-fat overfeeding have been shown to independently induce .Establish the contribution of muscle disuse and lipid availability to the development of inactivity-induced . Design, setting, participants, and interventions: Twenty healthy males underwent seven days of forearm cast immobilization combined with a fully-controlled eucaloric (CON, n=10, age 23± yr, BMI 23.8±1.0 kg·m-) or high-fat diet providing 50% excess energy from fat (HFD, n=10, age 23± yr, BMI 22.4±0.8 kg·m-).Prior to casting, and following  and 7 days of immobilization, forearm glucose uptake (FGU) and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) balance were assessed using the arterialized venous-deep venous (AV-V) forearm balance method following ingestion of a mixed macronutrient drink.Seven days of HFD increased body weight by 0.9±0. kg (P=0.002), but did not alter fasting, arterialized whole-blood glucose and serum  concentrations or the associated HOMA-IR or Matsuda indices. Two and seven days of forearm immobilization led to a 40±7% and 52±7% decrease in FGU, respectively (P<0.001), with no difference between day  and 7 and no effect of HFD. Forearm NEFA balance tended to increase following two and seven days of immobilization (P=0.095).forearm immobilization leads to a rapid and substantial decrease in FGU, which is accompanied by an increase in forearm NEFA balance but is not exacerbated by excess dietary fat intake.

However, SGA treatment is associated with severe metabolic alterations and body weight gain, which can increase the risk of type  diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and greatly accelerate mortality. Several underlying mechanisms have been proposed for antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG), but some studies suggest that metabolic changes in -sensitive tissues can be triggered before the onset of AIWG. In this review, we give an outlook on current research about the metabolic disturbances provoked by SGAs, with a particular focus on whole-body glucose homeostasis disturbances induced independently of AIWG, lipid dysregulation or adipose tissue disturbances. Specifically, we discuss the mechanistic insights gleamed from cellular and preclinical animal studies that have reported on the impact of SGAs on  signaling, endogenous glucose production, glucose uptake and  secretion in the liver, skeletal muscle and the endocrine pancreas. Finally, we discuss some of the genetic and epigenetic changes that might explain the different susceptibilities of SGA-treated patients to the metabolic side-effects of antipsychotics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662903>Are Nonnutritive Sweeteners Obesogenic? Associations between Diet, Faecal Microbiota, and Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Morbidly Obese Subjects.</a></h1><p>Obesity has been associated with changes in the gut microbiota and its metabolites. The study explored changes in the faecal microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) associated with the diet (including nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs)) and evaluated metabolic consequences in subjects with morbid obesity. The diet was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire. One unit of NNSs was 100 mL beverage with NNSs or  tablets/teaspoons of NNSs. The faecal microbiota was assessed with GA-map® dysbiosis test and SCFA with gas chromatography and flame ionisation detection. Fourteen men and 75 women with a mean age of 44.6 (SD 8.7) years, BMI 41.8 (SD 3.6) kg/m, and intake of NNSs 7.5 units/day (SD 3.; range 0-43) were included. Faecal butyric acid was positively and negatively associated with the intake of starch (partial correlation = 0.264; =0.015) and NNSs (partial correlation = -0.274; =0.011), respectively. NNSs were associated with changes in four out of 39 bacterial groups. Butyric acid has antiobesogenic effects, reduces , and improves dyslipidaemia. Since the weight-reducing effect of NNSs on obese adults trying to lose weight is dubious, it seems imprudent to use NNSs that might counteract the favourable effects of butyric acid.Copyright © 2019 Per G.

Marantodes pumilum (Blume) Kuntze (Primulaceae) is believed to have phytoestrogenic properties and is claimed to have beneficial effects in the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM), but the mechanism behind its phytoestrogenic effects on estrogen-deficient diabetic condition have not been fully examined.The present study investigated the effects of oral treatment with M. pumilum var. alata (MPA) extracts on the estrogen receptor, metabolic characteristics and  signaling pathway in pancreas and liver of ovariectomised nicotidamide streptozotocin-induced diabetes in female rats.Ovariectomised diabetic (OVXS) Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered with either aqueous leaf extract and ethanol (50%) stem-root extract of MPA (50 or 100 mg/kg) respectively for 28 days. Metabolic parameters were evaluated by measuring fasting blood glucose, serum , oral glucose and  tolerance test. Distribution and expression level of , oxidative stress and inflammatory marker in the pancreatic islets and liver were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blot, respectively.Oral treatment with aqueous leaf and ethanol (50%) stem-root extracts of MPA (100 mg/kg) significantly reversed the elevated fasting blood glucose, impaired glucose and  tolerance. The protein expression of , glucose transporter (GLUT- and GLUT-4) increased in the pancreatic islets and liver. Furthermore, marked improvement in the tissue morphology following treatment with MPA was observed. Similarly, the western blots analysis denotes improved  signaling in the liver and decreased reactive oxygen species producing enzymes, inflammatory and pro-apoptotic molecules with MPA treatment.Taken together, this work demonstrate that 100 mg/kg of aqueous leaf extract and ethanol (50%) stem-root extract of MPA improves β-cell function and  signaling in postmenopausal diabetes through attenuation of oxidative stress and partially mediated by oestrogen receptor stimulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

The aim of this study was to establish how reliable this strategy is to predict changes in liver histology in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).Patients with NASH who had participated in our prior randomized controlled trials of pioglitazone with complete paired data for IHTG content by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liver histology were included in the study.A total of 121 patients were included. Changes in IHTG were assessed in several ways: as a continuous variable (correlations), as categorical groups (IHTG change ≥0%; or IHTG reduction of 1-30%; 31-50%; 51-70%; or >70%), and in a binomial way as steatosis resolution or not (defined as achieving IHTG <5.56%). Changes in IHTG correlated with steatosis on histology (r = 0.54; p <0.01). However, the magnitude of IHTG reduction was not associated with the rate of response of the primary histological outcome (-point improvement in the NAFLD activity score from  different parameters, without worsening of fibrosis) or resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis, neither in patients receiving pioglitazone nor placebo. Changes in lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, or liver fibrosis were also independent of changes in IHTG, irrespective of treatment arm. Steatosis resolution was not associated with better histological outcomes either.Changes in IHTG predict changes in steatosis but not of other liver histological parameters. This implies that IHTG response to treatment should be interpreted with caution, as it may not be as reliable as previously believed to predict a treatment's overall clinical efficacy in patients with NASH.Quantification of liver fat by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently used to assess treatment responses in patients with fatty liver, with the assumption that improvements in liver fat translate into less inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis in the liver. However, in this article, we showed that changes in liver fat do not necessarily translate into changes in these parameters. This means that MRI may not be as useful to assess treatment response in patients with fatty liver as previously believed.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

High fat/high sucrose (HFHS) diet-induced  is implicated in multiple metabolic diseases, such as type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), these metabolic diseases has become epidemic health issue worldwide. In this study, the effect of C. lanceolata polysaccharide (CLPS) on improving  sensitivity in chronic HFHS diet-fed mice was investigated. Our data indicates that CLPS significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting serum  (FINS) and  index, in parallel with improved glucose and  tolerance impaired by HFHS diet. Impaired phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and hyperphosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307 were observed in the mice fed with HFHS diet, and those defects were also rescued by CLPS administration. In addition, CLPS caused a significant decrease in the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), and an increase in reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidised glutathione (GSSG) ratio; concurrent with enhanced expression of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and activated Nrf2 signaling. In summary, these findings suggest that CLPS ameliorates HFHS diet-induced  through activating anti-oxidative signaling pathway, providing new insights into the protective effects of C. lanceolata polysaccharide in metabolic disease.Copyright © 2019.

Despite the widespread concern, there are still few effective treatments except lifestyle interventions. Nuclear receptor subfamily  group E member 1 (Nr2e1) is a transcription factor which regulates many biological processes, including development, growth, and differentiation of nerve cells. However, its specific function in hepatocyte is still unknown. In the present study, we found that the expression of Nr2e1 decreased in the livers of high-fat diet-fed mice.

In last decade, the paralogous transcription factors MondoA and carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) have been revealed to be central mediators of glucose sensing in multiple metabolic organs. Under normal nutrient conditions, MondoA/ChREBP plays vital roles in maintaining glucose homeostasis. However, under chronic nutrient overload, the dysregulation of MondoA/ChREBP contributes to metabolic disorders, such as  (IR) and T2D. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of recent advances in the understanding of MondoA/ChREBP and its roles in T2D development. Specifically, we will briefly summarize the functional similarities and differences between MondoA and ChREBP. Then, we will update the roles of MondoA/ChREBP in four T2D-associated metabolic organs (i.e., the skeletal muscle, liver, adipose tissue, and pancreas) in physiological and pathological conditions. Finally, we will discuss the opportunities and challenges of MondoA/ChREBP as drug targets for anti-diabetes.

These factors, at the cellular level, are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and increased glucose uptake. Such events are poorly explored in the context of the salivary glands. In this study, we present a series of eight cases of a distinct salivary gland lesion characterized by multiple oncocytic cysts, and we provide new pathologic insights regarding its pathogenesis.Seven patients (87.5%) had a confirmed T2D, and obesity was identified in five (62.5%) patients. Clinically, the patients demonstrated bilateral parotid gland swelling with recurrent episodes of pain and enlargements. Imaging exams revealed multiple cystic lesions in both parotid glands. Microscopically, the parotid glands showed multiple cysts of different sizes, lined by oncocytic epithelial cells. Intraluminally, high-eosinophilic glass-like crystalloid materials were observed. Immunohistochemical studies were performed and the most notable finding was GLUT1 overexpression in the oncocytic cysts (not observed in any other oncocytic lesion of patients without T2D). In addition, higher expressions of mitochondrial antigen, fission 1 protein, and mitofusin- were observed in the oncocytic epithelium of the cysts. Furthermore, most of the oncocytic cysts demonstrated a pattern of cytokeratin expression consistent with striated ducts.Thus, these results strongly suggest that T2D is associated with alterations in GLUT1 expression in the cells of striated ducts with mitochondrial dysfunction, causing a hyperplastic process characterized by multiple oncocytic cysts.

There is an urgent need for innovative approaches to overcome these limitations.We devised a structure-based chimerisation strategy in which we substituted the thermally labile and low receptor affinity core of FGF21 with an HS binding deficient endocrinised core derived from a stable and high receptor affinity paracrine FGF1 (FGF1). The thermal stability, receptor binding ability, heparan sulfate and βKlotho coreceptor dependency of the chimera were measured using a thermal shift assay, SPR, SEC-MALS and cell-based studies. The half-life, tissue distribution, glucose lowering activity and adipose tissue remodeling were analyzed in normal and diabetic mice and monkeys.The melting temperature of the engineered chimera (FGF1-FGF21) increased by ∼22 °C relative to wild-type FGF21 (FGF21), and resulted in a ∼5-fold increase in half-life in vivo. The chimera also acquired an ability to bind the FGFR1c isoform - the principal receptor that mediates the metabolic actions of FGF21 - and consequently was dramatically more effective than FGF21 in correcting hyperglycemia and in ameliorating  in db/db mice. Our chimeric FGF21 also exerted a significant beneficial effect on glycemic control in spontaneous diabetic cynomolgus monkeys.Our study describes a structure-based chimerisation approach that effectively mitigates both the intrinsically weak receptor binding affinities and short half-lives of endocrine FGFs, and advance the development of the FGF21 hormone into a potentially useful drug for Type  diabetes.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Anthropometric measurements, fructose consumption, glucose, lipid profile, , and IGFBP-1 levels were evaluated; the homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) was used. NAFLD was evaluated by ultrasound.We studied 83 children with a mean age of 9. ± 1.3 years. About 93% of the girls presented IR and lower levels of IGFBP-1 (p = 0.0001). The group with the lower levels of IGFBP-1 had higher HOMA-IR (p = 0.000002); IGFBP-1 was associated with fructose consumption (r = -0.25; p = 0.03), body mass index (BMI) (r=-0.42; p = 0.02), and HOMA-IR (r=-0.61; p = 0.002). About 81% of the children were classified as having mild or moderate/severe NAFLD, and these groups had higher HOMA-IR (p = 0.036) and fructose consumption (p = 0.0014).The girls had more metabolic alterations. The group with lower levels of IGFBP-1 (hepatic IR) was associated with higher BMI, HOMA-IR, and fructose consumption; the group with higher severity of NAFLD showed higher HOMA-IR and fructose consumption.Copyright: © 2019 Permanyer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670281>Effects of cannabinoid modulation on hypothalamic nesfatin-1 and .</a></h1><p>Both nesfatin-1 and cannabinoid systems involved in the regulation of sleep, metabolism, and food intake.

This study investigated nesfatin-1 and  in 72-h rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-deprived mice under the effects of cannabinoid, and cannabinoid receptors CB1R and CB2R blocking. Sixty mice were exposed to 72-h sleep deprivation. Groups and drug administrations were as follows: Group 1 (control) received injection of vehicle. Group  received WIN 55,212,. Group 3 received AM251 (CB1R antagonist) followed by WIN 55,212, injection. Group 4 received SR144528 (CB2R antagonist) followed by WIN 55,212, injection. Group 5 received only AM251. Group 6 received only SR144528. Blood samples were collected 1 h after drug administration and prepared for biochemical measurements. Glucose levels were measured by glucometer, whereas  and nesfatin-1 levels were measured by ELISA. Central nesfatin-1 was also assessed using immunohistochemistry. One-way analysis of variance together with post hoc Tukey's test was used for inter-group comparisons. Serum nesfatin-1 levels were comparable in all study groups. Brain nesfatin-1 immune-positive cell count was lower in WIN group compared to controls. The administration of CB1R or CB2R antagonist prevented reduction in nesfatin-1-positive cell count.  was higher in WINCB2 and CB2 groups than in control and WINCB1 groups.

We measured markers of systemic inflammation, monocyte activation and gut integrity. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare markers by HIV status; Pearson correlation and multiple linear regressions were used to assess associations of the HOMA-IR index with biomarkers of intestinal damage and translocation.Overall, 172 participants were enrolled in the study (57 PHIVs, 59 HEUs and 56 HUUs). The median age was 7.8 [interquartile range (IQR) 6.39, 8.84] years, 55% were female and the median body mass index (BMI) was 15 (IQR 14.3, 15.8) kg/m . Among PHIVs, the median CD4% was 37%, and 93% had viral load ≤ 20 copies/mL.

Time spent in SB, LIPA and MVPA was measured by accelerometer and transformed into isometric log-ratio coordinates. The associations between time spent in SB, LIPA and MVPA and biomarkers were examined by linear regression models. The change in each outcome of reallocating time between the three behaviors was estimated.ResultsThe findings show strong positive associations of time spent in MVPA and negative associations of time spent in SB relative to time spent in the other behaviors with sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) and homeostasis model assessment for  (HOMA-IR) and negative associations of time spent in SB with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Theoretically, reallocation of 19 minutes MVPA to SB or to LIPA was associated with a 17% and 17% larger SAD, 39% and 36% larger HOMA-IR values and 3.3% and .3% lower levels of HDL, respectively.ConclusionIn conclusion, our analysis from a time-use perspective supports the current evidence that sedentary time is devastating for the cardiometabolic health. While LIPA probably requires more time, maintaining or increasing time in MVPA are the most important features of the time use behaviors when promoting a favorable cardiometabolic risk profile in adults with prediabetes and type  diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648440>[High level of hemoglobin during the first trimester of pregnancy associated with the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus].</a></h1><p> To explore the relationship between hemoglobin (Hb) level during the first trimester of pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).  A total of 1 276 participants, who underwent scheduled prenatal examination and normal singleton delivery at the Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai and Hospital of Intergrated Chinese and Western Medicine in Minhang District, from January 2016 to May 2018 were included. There were 99 cases of GDM (GDM group) and 1 177 cases of normal (control group) pregnant women.Based on the serum Hb level during the first trimester of pregnancy, participants were divided into three groups, 236 cases of low Hb level group (Hb<110 g/L), 868 cases of normal Hb level group (110 g/L≤Hb<130 g/L), and 172 cases of high Hb level group (Hb≥130 g/L). Maternal clinical data were collected, including Hb level during the first trimester of pregnancy, three-point blood glucose (BG) of oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and fasting  during the second trimester of pregnancy. Homeostasis model assessment of  index (HOMA-IR) and homeostasis model assessment of pancreatic β cell function index (HOMA-β) were used to evaluate  and pancreatic β cell function.

Obesity occurs when dietary energy intake exceeds energy expenditure and has arisen in many societies due to an increasingly "obesogenic" environment in which physical activity has declined and yet children continue to be exposed to unhealthy, energy-dense diets. Additional risks for the development of obesity also include psychological issues and genetic factors. Obesity has many adverse health consequences including development of , Type  diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome. There are also important genetic influences on the likelihood of developing . Given the limited success of therapeutic interventions to treat obesity and the metabolic syndrome, there has been an increased interest in preventative strategies. These are likely to be most successful when targeting the young and will require a combination of approaches which will need inter-disciplinary collaborations across health and local government to target families, schools, and local environments to facilitate behavior changes which influence young people's eating behaviors and habitual levels of physical activity.Copyright © 2019 Gregory.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593502>Inhibiting myeloperoxidase prevents onset and reverses established high fat diet -induced microvascular .</a></h1><p>A high fat diet (HFD) can rapidly recruit neutrophils to  target tissues and within days induce microvascular  (IR). Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is highly enriched in neutrophils, can inhibit nitric oxide mediated vaso-relaxation in vitro and is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. AZD5904 irreversibly inhibits MPO and is in human clinical trials. MPO knockout, or chemical inhibition, blunts HFD induced metabolic IR in mice. Whether MPO affects microvascular IR or muscle metabolic  sensitivity in vivo is unknown. We used contrast-enhanced ultrasound and the euglycemic  clamp to test whether inhibiting MPO could prevent the development or reverse established HFD-induced metabolic and/or microvascular IR in Sprague-Dawley rats. Two weeks of HFD feeding blocked -mediated skeletal muscle capillary recruitment, inhibited glucose utilization, and  signaling to muscle. Continuous subcutaneous AZD5904 infusion during the two weeks selectively blocked HFD's microvascular effect. Furthermore, AZD5904 infusion during the last  of 4 weeks of HFD feeding restored microvascular  sensitivity but not metabolic IR. We conclude that inhibiting MPO selectively improves vascular IR. This selective microvascular effect may connote a therapeutic potential for MPO inhibition in the prevention of vascular disease/dysfunction seen in IR humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623292>Associations of Cardiovascular and All-Cause Mortality with Metabolic Syndrome in Hemodialysis Patients: A Prospective Single-Center Study.</a></h1><p> Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of risk factors, such as abdominal obesity, , dyslipidemia and hypertension, that together increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients have multiple comorbidities and many metabolic disorders, causing the frequent occurrence of metabolic syndrome. The goal of this study was to assess the prevalence of MetS in HD patients, and its association with all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. : A total of 138 HD patients were included in this prospective study. We analyzed demographic, anthropometric and biochemical data. Outcome measures were all-cause and CV mortality during the three-year follow-up. : MetS was diagnosed in 57.24% of enrolled patients. During the 36 months of follow-up, 33 patients died. MetS patients showed a significantly higher mortality rate than non-MetS (30.4% versus 16.36%,  < 0.001). The association of different MetS components with cardiovascular mortality reached significance when a minimum of three components were present (1.81 (95% confidence interval CI = 1.21-.33)), with a grouped increase in effect size for subjects with four or five MetS components. Subjects with MetS exhibited nearly twice as high risk for all-cause (hazard ratio HR = 1.99 (95%CI) = 1.42-.97) and .5 times for CV (HR = .51 (95%CI) = 1.25-3.83) mortality compared with those without MetS, after adjustment for age, gender, and cardiovascular disease.  The study demonstrates that MetS is widespread in HD patients. In future, the focus must be on an active screening approach, and treatment of cardiometabolic risk factors, aiming to reduce mortality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642491>Altered Expression of Adrenomedullin  and its Receptor in the Adipose Tissue of Obese Patients.</a></h1><p>Adrenomedullin  (AM2) plays protective roles in the renal and cardiovascular systems. Recently, studies on experimental animals showed that AM2 is an adipokine with beneficial effects on energy metabolism. However, there is little information regarding AM2 expression in human adipose tissue.To investigate the pattern and regulation of AM2 expression and that of its receptor component in human adipose tissue, in the context of obesity and type  diabetes.We measured metabolic parameters, serum AM2 and expression of ADM2 and its receptor component genes in abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue in obese (with or without type  diabetes) and normal-weight women. Serum AM2 was assessed before and 6-9 months after bariatric surgery. Expression/secretion of AM2 and its receptor was assessed in human adipocytes.ADM2 mRNA in both fat depots was higher in obese patients, whether diabetic or not. Although serum AM2 was significantly lower in obese patients, it was not changed after bariatric surgery. AM2 and its receptor complex were predominantly expressed by adipocytes, and expression of CALCRL, encoding a component of the AM2 receptor complex, was lower in both fat depots of obese patients. Incubating adipocytes with substances mimicking the microenvironment of obese adipose tissue increased ADM2 mRNA but reduced AM2 secretion into culture media and CALCRL mRNA expression.Our data indicate that AM2 signalling is suppressed in adipose tissue in obesity, involving lower receptor expression and ligand availability, likely contributing to  and other aspects of the pathophysiology associated with obesity.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Gut microbiome diversity and its natural fermentation products are not only correlated with MS and CAD, but their correlations also appear to be stronger than the associations with traditional risk factors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide a new potential pathway for the natural fermentation product butyrate to improve MS and to examine whether it is associated with serum metabolic profiles and gut flora composition.  C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were treated with 400 mg/kg of sodium butyrate for 16 weeks. Blood and fecal samples were collected, and the metabolite concentrations and 16s rRNA were measured with liquid chromatography-MS and Illumina platform, respectively. The plasma differential metabolites and gut microbiome composition were analyzed with XCMS online and QIIME , respectively.  Gut microbiome-derived butyrate reduced glucose intolerance and , resisting HFD-induced increase in the relative abundance of f_, f_, and f_. Meanwhile, sodium butyrate increased the levels of α-linolenate, all-trans-retinal, resolvin E1, and leukotriene in the plasma, and the differential pathways showed enrichment in mainly resolvin E biosynthesis, histidine degradation, lipoxin biosynthesis, and leukotriene biosynthesis. Moreover, sodium butyrate increased the levels of phosphorylated-adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) and facilitated glucose transporter member 4 (GLUT4) in the adipose tissue.  Butyrate can induce AMPK activation and GLUT4 expression in the adipose tissue, improving cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related metabolic disorder, resisting HFD-induced gut microbiome dysbiosis, and promoting resolvin E1 and lipoxin biosynthesis. Oral supplement of the natural fermentation product butyrate can be a potential strategy for preventing CVD.Copyright © 2019 Gao, Lv, Long, Chen, He, Ruan and Zhu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647106>First-line ovulation induction for polycystic ovary syndrome: an individual participant data meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most frequent cause of anovulatory infertility. In women with PCOS, effective ovulation induction serves as an important first-line treatment for anovulatory infertility. Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis is considered as the gold standard for evidence synthesis which provides accurate assessments of outcomes from primary randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and allows additional analyses for time-to-event outcomes. It also facilitates treatment-covariate interaction analyses and therefore offers an opportunity for personalised medicine.We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different ovulation induction agents, in particular letrozole alone and clomiphene citrate (CC) plus metformin, as compared to CC alone, as the first-line choice for ovulation induction in women with PCOS and infertility, and to explore interactions between treatment and participant-level baseline characteristics.We searched electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to 20 December 2018. We included RCTs comparing the following interventions with each other or placebo/no treatment in women with PCOS and infertility: CC, metformin, CC plus metformin, letrozole, gonadotrophin and tamoxifen. We excluded studies on treatment-resistant women. The primary outcome was live birth. We contacted the investigators of eligible RCTs to share the IPD and performed IPD meta-analyses. We assessed the risk of bias by using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs.IPD of 20 RCTs including 3962 women with PCOS were obtained. Six RCTs compared letrozole and CC in 1284 women. Compared with CC, letrozole improved live birth rates (3 RCTs, 1043 women, risk ratio [RR] 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-1.75, moderate-certainty evidence) and clinical pregnancy rates (6 RCTs, 1284 women, RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.23-1.70, moderate-certainty evidence) and reduced time-to-pregnancy (6 RCTs, 1235 women, hazard ratio [HR] 1.72, 95% CI 1.38-.15, moderate-certainty evidence). Meta-analyses of effect modifications showed a positive interaction between baseline serum total testosterone levels and treatment effects on live birth (interaction RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.01-1.65). Eight RCTs compared CC plus metformin to CC alone in 1039 women. Compared with CC alone, CC plus metformin might improve clinical pregnancy rates (8 RCTs, 1039 women, RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.39, low-certainty evidence) and might reduce time-to-pregnancy (7 RCTs, 898 women, HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00-1.57, low-certainty evidence), but there was insufficient evidence of a difference on live birth rates (5 RCTs, 907 women, RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.87-1.35, low-certainty evidence). Meta-analyses of effect modifications showed a positive interaction between baseline  levels and treatment effects on live birth in the comparison between CC plus metformin and CC (interaction RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06).In women with PCOS, letrozole improves live birth and clinical pregnancy rates and reduces time-to-pregnancy compared to CC and therefore can be recommended as the preferred first-line treatment for women with PCOS and infertility. CC plus metformin may increase clinical pregnancy and may reduce time-to-pregnancy compared to CC alone, while there is insufficient evidence of a difference on live birth. Treatment effects of letrozole are influenced by baseline serum levels of total testosterone, while those of CC plus metformin are affected by baseline serum levels of . These interactions between treatments and biomarkers on hyperandrogenaemia and  provide further insights into a personalised approach for the management of anovulatory infertility related to PCOS.© The Author(s) 2019.

Muscle mass loss is associated with weakness, fatigue, and . In fact, it is predicted that controlling muscle atrophy can reduce morbidity and mortality associated with diseases such as cancer cachexia and sarcopenia.We analyzed gene expression data from muscle of mice or human patients with diverse muscle pathologies and identified LMCD1 as a gene strongly associated with skeletal muscle function. We transiently expressed or silenced LMCD1 in mouse gastrocnemius muscle or in mouse primary muscle cells and determined muscle/cell size, targeted gene expression, kinase activity with kinase arrays, protein immunoblotting, and protein synthesis levels. To evaluate force, calcium handling, and fatigue, we transduced the flexor digitorum brevis muscle with a LMCD1-expressing adenovirus and measured specific force and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca release in individual fibers. Finally, to explore the relationship between LMCD1 and calcineurin, we ectopically expressed Lmcd1 in the gastrocnemius muscle and treated those mice with cyclosporine A (calcineurin inhibitor). In addition, we used a luciferase reporter construct containing the myoregulin gene promoter to confirm the role of a LMCD1-calcineurin-myoregulin axis in skeletal muscle mass control and calcium handling.Here, we identify LIM and cysteine-rich domains 1 (LMCD1) as a positive regulator of muscle mass, that increases muscle protein synthesis and fiber size. LMCD1 expression in vivo was sufficient to increase specific force with lower requirement for calcium handling and to reduce muscle fatigue. Conversely, silencing LMCD1 expression impairs calcium handling and force, and induces muscle fatigue without overt atrophy. The actions of LMCD1 were dependent on calcineurin, as its inhibition using cyclosporine A reverted the observed hypertrophic phenotype. Finally, we determined that LMCD1 represses the expression of myoregulin, a known negative regulator of muscle performance. Interestingly, we observed that skeletal muscle LMCD1 expression is reduced in patients with skeletal muscle disease.Our gain- and loss-of-function studies show that LMCD1 controls protein synthesis, muscle fiber size, specific force, Ca handling, and fatigue . This work uncovers a novel role for LMCD1 in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and function with potential therapeutic implications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641012> in healthy US adults: findings from the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES).</a></h1><p> is fundamental in two-conditions that are epidemic in the United States and globally: obesity and Type  diabetes. We examined 's relationship to common health-related endpoints in a large population-based sample.The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is a cross-sectional study that uses a complex multistage probability design to obtain a representative sample of the United States population. Adult participants were included from 8 successive -year data waves (1999-2014) including 9224 normal individuals, 7699 pre-diabetic and 3413 diabetic subjects. We examined the Homeostatic Model for  (HOMA-IR) in 20336 participants in relation to demographic, anthropometric and clinical data. We examined the relationship of HOMA-IR to 8 groups of outcome variables: general health, anthropometric/metabolic (waist size, BMI), cardiovascular (blood pressure), lipid (triglycerides, HDL), hepatic (ALT, GGT), hematologic (WBC, Hgb, platelets), inflammatory (CRP) and nutritional (vitamin D, C, serum folate and pyridoxine) variables.HOMA-IR was generally strongly, monotonically, and highly significantly associated with adjusted outcomes in normal subjects. In the normal subset, the OR and 95% CI for a quartile change in HOMA-IR for obesity (BMI >30) was 3.62 (3.30, 3.97), and for the highest quintile for the triglyceride/HDL the ratio was .00 (1.77-.26), for GGT it was 1.40 (1.24-1.58), and for white blood count it was 1.28 (1.16-1.40).HOMA-IR levels are associated with poorer general health and adverse changes across a wide range of markers.Clinically, checking  levels may be helpful to identify patients that merit observation and early interventions.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634466>Nutrient metabolism, subcellular redox state and oxidative stress in pancreatic islets and β-cells.</a></h1><p>-secreting pancreatic β-cells play a critical role in blood glucose homeostasis and the development of type  diabetes (T2D) in the context of . Based on data obtained at the whole cell level using poorly specific chemical probes, reactive oxygen species (ROS) like superoxide and hydrogen peroxide have been proposed to contribute to the stimulation of  secretion by nutrients (positive role) and to the alterations of cell survival and secretory function in T2D (negative role). This raised the controversial hypothesis that any attempt to decrease β-cell oxidative stress and apoptosis in T2D would further impair  secretion. Over the last decade, the development of genetically-encoded redox probes that can be targeted to cellular compartments of interest and are specific of redox couples allowed the evaluation of short- and long-term effects of nutrients on β-cell redox changes at the subcellular level. The data indicated that the nutrient regulation of β-cell redox signaling and ROS toxicity is far more complex than previously thought, and that the subcellular compartmentation of these processes cannot be neglected when evaluating the mechanisms of ROS production or the efficacy of antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant drugs under glucolipotoxic conditions and in T2D. In this review, we present what is currently known about the compartmentation of redox homeostatic systems and tools to investigate it. We then review data about the effects of nutrients on β-cell subcellular redox state under normal conditions and in the context of T2D, and discuss challenges and opportunities in the field.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The HOMA1-IR and HOMA2-IR 90 percentile in the healthy group (n=75) was used as the cut-off point for . A ROC curve was constructed to determine the cut-off point for metabolic syndrome.HOMA1-IR was associated with BMI, central obesity, and triglycerides (<0.05). HOMA2-IR was associated with BMI, central obesity, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (<0.05). The cut-off points for  for HOMA-1 and HOMA- were >3.95 and >.20 and for metabolic syndrome were >.98 (63.4% sensitivity and 73.3% specificity) and >1.55 (60.6% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity), respectively.HOMA cut-off points may be used as a screening tool to identify  and metabolic syndrome among Cuban-Americans living in South Florida.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667610>Serum zonulin level is not elevated in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome without metabolic syndrome.</a></h1><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex disorder with gynecological, metabolic and carcinogenic effects. Increased intestinal permeability is related with obesity, , type 1 and  diabetes mellitus. The existence of such a relationship between PCOS and intestinal permeability has come to an end. Zonulin can change intestinal permeability, and this effect is reversible. We studied the relation between zonulin and the hormonal and metabolic parameters of PCOS.A total of 45 women with PCOS and 17 healthy women were included in the study. Histories were taken from all the participants, body mass indexes were calculated, and biochemical tests and suprapubic over ultrasonography were made. Zonulin was studied with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Serum zonulin levels were similar between PCOS and control groups (p = 0.893). In all participants, there were negative correlations between zonulin and the total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and non-HDL-cholesterol (respectively, p = 0.00, 0.018, 0.004, 0.002), there were boundary correlations with age and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (respectively, p = 0.052 and 0.058). No statistically significant was detected in the PCOS group except negative correlation between zonulin and age (p = 0.046), boundary correlation between zonulin and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (p = 0.064).PCOS patients did not have metabolic syndrome. Zonulin was not higher in PCOS then controls, and it had only negative relation with age. The negative relation between zonulin and some metabolic parameters in all participants was not detected in PCOS group. So zonulin is not a useful molecule for the diagnosis of PCOS without metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647926>Empagliflozin reduces the levels of CD36 and cardiotoxic lipids while improving autophagy in the hearts of Zucker diabetic fatty rats.</a></h1><p>The EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in patients with Type  Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)) trial made evident the potentiality of pharmacological sodium-glucose cotransporter  (SGLT2) inhibition for treating patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Since the effect of empagliflozin or other SGLT2 inhibitors on the whole cardiac metabolic profile was never analysed before, and with the purpose to contribute to elucidate the benefits at cardiac level of the use of empagliflozin, we explored the effect of the treatment with empagliflozin for six weeks on the cardiac metabolomic profile of Zucker diabetic fatty rats, a model of early stage T2DM, using untargeted metabolomics approach. Empagliflozin reduced significantly the cardiac content of sphingolipids (ceramides and sphingomyelins) and glycerophospholipids (major bioactive contributing factors linking  to cardiac damage) and decreased the cardiac content of the fatty acid transporter cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36); induced significant decreases of the cardiac levels of essential glycolysis intermediaries ,3-bisphosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate, and regulated the abundance of several amino acids of relevance as tricarboxylic acid suppliers and/or in the metabolic control of the cardiac function as glutamic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid and sarcosine. Empagliflozin treatment activated the cardioprotective master regulator of cellular energyhomeostasis AMP-activatedproteinkinase (AMPK) and enhanced autophagy at cardiac level, while it decreased significantly the cardiac mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemerin, TNF-α and MCP-1, reinforcing the hypothesis of a direct role for empagliflozin in attenuating cardiac inflammation. Our results provide an advancement on the knowledge of the mechanisms linking the therapy with empagliflozin with protective effects on the development of cardiometabolic diseases whose course is associated with remarkable cardiac bioenergetics dysregulation and disarrangement in cardiac metabolome and lipidome.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In 122 federally employed women without diabetes, 73 black (58 African American and 15 African immigrant) and 49 white; age 44{plus minus}10 (mean{plus minus}SD); BMI 30.0{plus minus}5.6 kg/m2 we measured lipoprotein subfractions using nuclear magnetic resonance. Hepatic fat was measured by proton MRS,  sensitivity index (SI) calculated by minimal modeling from a frequently-sampled intravenous glucose test, RBC fatty acid profiles by gas chromatography were used to estimate SCD-1 indices. Hepatic fat, S, and SCD-1 were similar in black women and lower than in whites, regardless of menopausal status. Fasting and postprandial large, medium and small TRLPs, but not very small TRLPs, were lower in black women. Fasting large, medium and very small TRLPs negatively correlated with S and positively correlated with visceral and hepatic fat, and SCD-1 activity in both groups. In multivariate models, visceral fat and SCD-1 were associated with total fasting TRLP concentrations (adjR= 0.39, P=0.001). Black women had smaller postprandial changes in large (P=0.005) and medium TRLPs (P=0.007).  Lower visceral fat and SCD-1 activity may contribute to the paradoxical association of lower fasting and postprandial TRLP subfractions despite  in black compared to white pre- and post-menopausal women. Similar concentrations of very small TRLPs are related to  and could be important mediators of cardiometabolic disease risk in women.  .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592623>The Effect of Carbohydrate Ingestion Following Eccentric  Exercise on AKT/mTOR and ERK Pathways: A Randomized, Double-Blinded, Crossover Study.</a></h1><p>To determine the acute effects of carbohydrate (CHO) ingestion following a bout of maximal eccentric  exercise on key anabolic kinases of mammalian target of rapamycin and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. The authors' hypothesis was that the activation of anabolic signaling pathways known to be upregulated by  exercise would be further stimulated by the physiological hyperinsulinemia resulting from CHO supplementation.Ten -trained men were randomized in a crossover, double-blind, placebo (PLA)-controlled manner to ingest either a noncaloric PLA or 3 g/kg of CHO beverage throughout recovery from  exercise. Muscle biopsies were collected at rest, immediately after a single bout of intense lower body  exercise, and after 3 hr of recovery.CHO ingestion elevated plasma glucose and  concentrations throughout recovery compared with PLA ingestion. The ERK pathway (phosphorylation of ERK1/ [Thr202/Tyr204], RSK [Ser380], and p70S6K [Thr421/Ser424]) was markedly activated immediately after  exercise, without any effect of CHO supplementation. The phosphorylation state of AKT (Thr308) was unchanged postexercise in the PLA trial and increased at 3 hr of recovery above resting with ingestion of CHO compared with PLA. Despite stimulating-marked phosphorylation of AKT, CHO ingestion did not enhance  exercise-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K (Thr389) and rpS6 (Ser235/236 and Ser240/244).CHO supplementation after  exercise and hyperinsulinemia does not influence the ERK pathway nor the mTORC1 target p70S6K and its downstream proteins, despite the increased AKT phosphorylation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673465>Effects of vitamin D supplementation on follicular development, gonadotropins and sex hormone concentrations, and  in induced polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h1><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) as a reproductive disorder disturbs ovarian follicular development, vitamin D stimulated  activity, and sex hormone concentrations.

In 23 research centers in Spain, 6874 men and women aged 55 to 75 years with metabolic syndrome and no cardiovascular disease were enrolled in the trial between September 2013 and December 2016, with final data collection in March 2019.Participants were randomized to an intervention group that encouraged an energy-reduced Mediterranean diet, promoted physical activity, and provided behavioral support (n = 3406) or to a control group that encouraged an energy-unrestricted Mediterranean diet (n = 3468). All participants received allotments of extra-virgin olive oil (1 L/mo) and nuts (125 g/mo) for free.The primary outcome was 12-month change in adherence based on the energy-reduced Mediterranean diet (er-MedDiet) score (range, 0-17; higher scores indicate greater adherence; minimal clinically important difference, 1 point).Among 6874 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 65.0 [4.9] years; 3406 [52%] men), 6583 (96%) completed the 12-month follow-up and were included in the main analysis. The mean (SD) er-MedDiet score was 8.5 (.6) at baseline and 13.

In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of ED and evaluate the associated risk factors in a cohort of 254 young (18-49 years) nondiabetic obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg m) men from primary care. Erectile function (International Index of Erectile Function [IIEF-5] questionnaire), quality of life (Aging Males' Symptoms [AMS scale]), and body composition analysis (Tanita MC-180MA) were determined. Total testosterone was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to study the factors associated with ED. ED prevalence was 42.1%. Subjects with ED presented higher BMI, waist circumference, number of components of the metabolic syndrome, AMS score, , and a more unfavorable body composition than those without ED. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a pathological AMS score (odds ratio [OR]: 4.238, P < 0.001), degree of obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg m, OR: .602, P = 0.005, compared with BMI 30-34.9 kg m), high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels (OR: 0.956, P = 0.004), and age (OR: 1.047, P = 0.016) were factors independently associated with ED. In conclusion, we demonstrate that, in a primary care-based cohort of nondiabetic young obese men, ED affected >40% of subjects. A pathological AMS score, the degree of obesity, and age were positively associated with ED, while elevated HDL-cholesterol levels were inversely associated with the odds of presenting ED. Further prospective studies are needed to evaluate the long-term consequences of ED in this population.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666083>Predictive and diagnostic biomarkers for gestational diabetes and its associated metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.</a></h1><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as the presence of high blood glucose levels with the onset, or detected for the first time during pregnancy, as a result of increased . GDM may be induced by dysregulation of pancreatic β-cell function and/or by alteration of secreted gestational hormones and peptides related with glucose homeostasis. It may affect one out of five pregnancies, leading to perinatal morbidity and adverse neonatal outcomes, and high risk of chronic metabolic and cardiovascular injuries in both mother and offspring. Currently, GDM diagnosis is based on evaluation of glucose homeostasis at late stages of pregnancy, but increased age and body-weight, and familiar or previous occurrence of GDM, may conditionate this criteria. In addition, an earlier and more specific detection of GDM with associated metabolic and cardiovascular risk could improve GDM development and outcomes. In this sense, 1st-2nd trimester-released biomarkers found in maternal plasma including adipose tissue-derived factors such as adiponectin, visfatin, omentin-1, fatty acid-binding protein-4 and retinol binding-protein-4 have shown correlations with GDM development. Moreover, placenta-related factors such as sex hormone-binding globulin, afamin, fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factors-21/23, ficolin-3 and follistatin, or specific micro-RNAs may participate in GDM progression and be useful for its recognition. Finally, urine-excreted metabolites such as those related with serotonin system, non-polar amino-acids and ketone bodies, may complete a predictive or early-diagnostic panel of biomarkers for GDM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669171>Hormonal regulation of visfatin gene in avian Leghorn male hepatoma (LMH) cells.</a></h1><p>Visfain has been extensively studied in mammals and has been shown to play an important role in obesity and . However, there is a paucity of information on visfatin regulation in non-mammalian species. After characterization of chicken visfatin gene, we undertook this study to determine its hormonal regulation in avian (non-mammalian) liver cells. Addition of 5 ng/mL TNFα, 100 ng/mL leptin, 1, 3, 10 or 100 ng/mL T3 for 24 h upregulated visfatin gene expression by 1., 1.8, 1.95, 1.75, 1.80, and .45 folds (P < .05), respectively, compared to untreated LMH cells. Administration of 10 ng/mL of orexin A significantly down regulated visfatin gene expression by 1.35 folds compared to control cells. In contrast, treatment with IL-6 or orexin B for 24 h did not influence visfatin mRNA abundance. These pro-inflammatory cytokines and obesity-related hormones modulate the expression of CRP, INSIG2, and nuclear orphan receptors. Hepatic CRP gene expression was significantly upregulated by IL-6, TNFα, orexin B, and T3 and down regulated by leptin and orexin A. LXR mRNA abundances were increased by orexin A, decreased by orexin B, and T3, and did not affected by IL6, TNFα, or leptin. The expression of FXR gene was induced by IL-6, leptin, and T3, but it was not influenced by TNFα, orexin A or B. CXR gene expression was up regulated by TNFα, leptin, orexin B, and T3, down regulated by 5 ng/mL orexin A, and did not affected by IL-6. INSIG2 mRNA levels were increased by TNFα (5 ng/mL), leptin (100 ng/mL), and T3 (1, 3, 10, and 100 ng/mL), decreased by orexin A, and remained unchanged with IL-6 or orexin B treatment. Together, this is the first report showing hormonal regulation of visfatin in avian hepatocyte cells and suggesting a potential role of CRP, INSIG2, and nuclear orphan receptor LXR, FXR, and CXR in mediating these hormonal effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to investigate the association between TG/HDL-C and IR (as measured by homeostasis model assessment of IR [HOMA-IR]), and establish a clinical prediction rule for IR in middle-aged and elderly Taiwanese.A total of 398 subjects were recruited, and each subject completed a questionnaire that included personal and medical history data, and underwent anthropometric measurement and blood sampling. IR was defined as HOMA-IR index value ≥.0. Chi-squared test, independent two-sample t-test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and multiple logistic regression were used to evaluate the association between IR and TG/HDL-C ratio. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to evaluate the ability of the developed clinical prediction rule to correctly discriminate between subjects of IR positive and IR negative groups.A significant association between IR and TG/HDL-C ratio was identified with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.35 (p-value< 0.001). In multiple logistic regression, high BMI (OR = 1.23; 95% C.I. = 1.13-1.33), hypertension (OR = 1.90; 95% C.I. = 1.12-3.21), diabetes mellitus (OR = 5.44; 95% C.I. = .93-10.08) and high TG/HDL ratio (OR = 1.45; 95% C.I. = 1.23-1.72) were significantly associated with the risk of elevated HOMA-IR. The area under ROC curves for TG/HDL-C ratio was 0.729 and the optimal threshold value was .197 where the corresponding of sensitivity and specificity were 72.4 and 65.1%.Our findings showed that the elevated TG/HDL-C ratio was significantly associated with IR and could be used as an indicator of IR among the middle-aged and elderly population in Taiwan. It is clinically available, thus eliminating any additional costs. Future research is warranted to investigate the use of TG/HDL-C ratio combined with other risk factors for predicting IR under diverse ethnic backgrounds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678493>Identification of a subset of trace amine-associated receptors and ligands as potential modulators of  secretion.</a></h1><p>The worldwide prevalence of diabetes has reached 8.5% among adults, and this is characterised by elevated glucose concentrations and failing  secretion. Furthermore, most people with type  diabetes are either obese or overweight, with the associated dyslipidaemia contributing to the development of  and increased cardiovascular risk. Here we incubated INS-1 pancreatic β-cells for 72h in RPMI-1640 media, or media supplemented with 28mM glucose, 200µM palmitic acid, and 200µM oleic acid as a cellular model of diabetic glucolipotoxicity. Illumina HiSeq gene expression analysis showed the trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) family to be among the most highly downregulated by glucolipotoxicity. Importantly, MetaCore integrated knowledge database, from Clarivate Analytics, indicated potential TAAR impact on  secretion through adenylyl cyclase signalling pathways. We therefore investigated the effect of TAAR ligands on cAMP signalling and  secretion, and found that only the branch of the TAAR family tree that is activated by isopentylamine, -phenylethylamine, p-tyramine, and agmatine significantly increased intracellular cAMP and resulted in increased  secretion from INS-1 cells and primary mouse islets under normal conditions. Crucially however, this enhancement was not evident when the receptor family was downregulated by glucolipotoxic conditions. This data indicates that a subset of TAARs are regulators of  secretion in pancreatic β-cells, and that their downregulation contributes to glucolipotoxic inhibition of  secretion. As such they may be potential targets for treatment of type  diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Owing to paucity of studies focused on peripheral IR in relation to pathological outcome, we aim to investigate homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) by histological characteristics of NAFLD.Liver biopsy of 588 patients was screened. After excluding etiologies other than NAFLD and factors contributing to IR, serum HOMA-IR was compared with patients' histologic features. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess their relationship. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) was calculated to assess the discriminatory ability of homeostatic model assessment of IR for advanced lobular inflammation (LI).We observed higher serum level of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and low-density lipoprotein as HOMA-IR increased. HOMA-IR is significantly associated with severity of LI (odds ratio = 1.222, 95% confidence interval = 1.135-1.315, P < 0.001), similar association remained after adjusting for age, BMI, hemoglobin A1c, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides (odds ratio = 1.205, 95% confidence interval = 1.102-1.317, P < 0.001).

CT was used to estimate liver and abdominal fat and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to measure body composition. Fasting blood was collected for lipids, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), adiponectin, and fetuin-A. Homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR), whole-body  sensitivity index (WBISI), insulinogenic index (IGI), and oral disposition index (oDI) were calculated after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test.Fifty-two percent of participants were male; mean (±SD) age was 28.5 ± 7.8 years, and body mass index was 22.4 ± 3.0 kg/m. Mean liver attenuation (MLA) and liver/spleen (LS) ratio, both inversely correlated to liver fat, were 62.8 ± 4.3 HU and 1. ± 0.1, respectively; 3.8% of participants had liver fat >30% (LS ratio < 1). In age, sex, and BMI-adjusted correlations, MLA was negatively associated with weight ( = -0.30;  = 0.009) and height ( = -0.28;  = 0.017) and was associated with fasting glucose ( = 0.23;  = 0.05), fasting  ( = 0.42;  ≤ 0.001) and HOMA-IR ( = 0.35;  = 0.004).

This intervention was modeled on standard brief motivational interventions for alcohol used in the workplace that promote health knowledge and goal setting.Outcomes included changes in SSB intake, Homeostatic Model Assessment of  (HOMA-IR), and measures of abdominal adiposity. The primary associations tested were the correlation between changes in SSB intake and changes in HOMA-IR.Among the 214 study participants, 124 (57.9%) were women, with a mean (SD) age of 41. (11.0) years and a baseline mean (SD) body mass index of 29.4 (6.5). They reported a mean daily intake of 1050 mL (35 fl oz) of SSBs at baseline and 540 mL (18 fl oz) at follow-up-a 510-mL (17-fl oz) (48.6%) decrease (P < .001). Reductions in SSB intake correlated with improvements in HOMA-IR (r = 0.16; P = .03). Those not randomized to receive the brief intervention reduced their SSB intake by a mean (SD) of 246.0 (84.0) mL (8. [.8] fl oz), while those also receiving the brief intervention reduced SSB intake by 762.0 (84.0) mL (25.4 [.8] fl oz). From baseline to follow-up, there were significant reductions in mean (SE) waist circumference (.1 [.8] cm; P < .001).This study's findings suggest that the workplace sales ban was associated with a reduction in SSB intake and a significant reduction in waist circumference among employees within 10 months. The randomized clinical trial portion of this study found that targeting those at high risk with a brief motivational intervention led to additional improvements. Workplace sales bans may offer a promising new private-sector strategy for reducing the health harms of SSB intake.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629408>Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression and serum levels as markers of pre-clinical atherosclerosis in polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h1><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive endocrine disorder characterized by obesity, hyperandrogenism, and . Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is a proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokine which is associated with atherosclerosis, , and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The pathogenesis of PCOS is not precisely known. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the potential role of ICAM-1 expression and serum ICAM-1 concentrations in pathogenesis of PCOS. Moreover, we aimed to evaluate the possible relationship between ICAM-1 gene expression with carotid intima-media thickness as well as clinic-morphological features of PCOS.This case control study enrolled 180 patients with PCOS and 120 controls groups and they were stratified according to their fasting plasma glucose (FPG) into three subgroups; normal glucose tolerance (NGT) [n = 75], those with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) [n = 65], and 40 patients with type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Circulating ICAM-1 expression levels were determined by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serum ICAM-1 concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Our results revealed that PCOS patients had higher values of ICAM-1expression and serum levels. Among PCOS patients, T2DM patients had the highest values of ICAM-1 expression and serum levels compared to IGT and NGT subgroups. The ICAM-1 expression and serum levels were significantly positive correlated with cardiovascular risk and PCOS phenotypes. Linear regression test showed that HOMA-IR was the main predictors of serum ICAM-1 levels in PCOS. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis revealed that, the power of ICAM-1 expression levels was higher than serum ICAM-1 in diagnosis of PCOS and in differentiating T2DM from IGT and NGT subgroups. Interestingly, combination of both ICAM-1 expression and serum levels improved the diagnostic role of serum ICAM-1.ICAM-1 expression and serum levels were higher in women with PCOS compared to control group also, there was a strong independent association between higher ICAM-1 expression and serum levels with cardiovascular risks in PCOS group.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606399>The fasting C-glucose breath test is a more sensitive evaluation method for diagnosing hepatic  as a cardiovascular risk factor than HOMA-IR.</a></h1><p>Although we previously reported the fasting C-glucose breath test (FGBT) was useful for the diagnosis of hepatic  (IR), there has been no report in an actual clinical setting. We therefore performed the FGBT in patients with heart disease to assess the difference in the diagnostic ability of HIR between the FGBT and HOMA-IR; we also assessed the relationship between the FGBT and known cardiovascular risk factors.Two hundred patients (100 with ischemic heart disease [IHD], 50 with non-ischemic heart disease [NIHD], and 50 with non-cardiac lifestyle-related disease [NCD]) participated in this study. The data of 40 healthy volunteers [HV] was obtained in our previous study. We evaluated the C excretion rate at 120 min (C) as the indicator of hepatic IR in the FGBT.The value of C in each disease group was significantly lower than in HV, but the HOMA-IR in the IHD and NCD groups was not significantly different from that in HV. The value of C significantly correlated with known cardiovascular risk factors.These results indicated the FGBT is more sensitive than HOMA-IR for evaluating hepatic IR as a cardiovascular risk factor and is likely useful for managing patients to prevent cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we aimed to explore the mechanisms responsible for aggravating diabetes after PM exposure, and study the roles of inflammatory factors in -resistant type  diabetes. Our study indicated that short-time PM exposure enhances  in type  diabetic rats and significantly raises inflammatory factors, including IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1, in lungs. However, we found that of these inflammatory factors only IL-6 levels are elevated in blood, liver, adipose tissue, and macrophages, but not in skeletal muscle. IL-6 induced activation of the STAT3/SOCS3 pathway in liver, but not other downstream pathways including STAT1, ERK1/, and PI3K. Both STAT3 inhibition and IL-6 neutralization effectively alleviated the disorders of glucose metabolism after PM exposure. Taken together, this suggests that the systemic increase in IL-6 may play an important role in the deterioration of the type  diabetes via IL-6/STAT3/SOCS3 pathway in liver after short-time exposure to PM. Besides, we unexpectedly found a stronger  to the PM exposure-induced increase in IL-6 in skeleton muscle than those of many other tissues.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Military Cognitive and Brain Sciences.

Different epidemiologic studies have shown a significant relationship between lower intake of fibre and metabolic disorders. There are many naturally occurring dietary fibres among which gums are utmost important class e.g. guar gum, locust bean gum, tara gum, gellan gum, and gum acacia. Gum acacia has been considered as a safe dietary fibre by the United States, Food and Drug Administration and it is used widely as a stabilizer, thickening agent, and emulsifier in the food industry. Though gum acacia feeding has been reported to exert many beneficial effects in both rodents and humans, the underpinning for the different proposed molecular mechanisms are still elusive. So it would be of great relevance to conduct studies to understand the molecular mechanism of action of such fibres in the management of metabolic diseases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636448>Age-related hyperinsulinemia leads to  in neurons and cell-cycle-induced senescence.</a></h1><p>Prediabetes and Alzheimer's disease both increase in prevalence with age. The former is a risk factor for the latter, but a mechanistic linkage between them remains elusive. We show that prediabetic serum hyperinsulinemia is reflected in the cerebrospinal fluid and that this chronically elevated  renders neurons resistant to . This leads to abnormal electrophysiological activity and other defects. In addition, neuronal  reduces hexokinase , thus impairing glycolysis. This hampers the ubiquitination and degradation of p35, favoring its cleavage to p25, which hyperactivates CDK5 and interferes with the GSK3β-induced degradation of β-catenin. CDK5 contributes to neuronal cell death while β-catenin enters the neuronal nucleus and re-activates the cell cycle machinery. Unable to successfully divide, the neuron instead enters a senescent-like state. These findings offer a direct connection between peripheral hyperinsulinemia, as found in prediabetes, age-related neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.

In this study, we aimed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of an IFD to reduce body mass index and glucose metabolism in the general population without diabetes mellitus. Cochrane, PubMed, and Embase databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that compared an IFD with a regular diet or a continuous calorie restriction diet. The effectiveness of an IFD was estimated by the weighted mean difference (WMD) for several variables associated with glucometabolic parameters including body mass index (BMI) and fasting glucose. The pooled mean differences of outcomes were calculated using a random effects model. From 2814 studies identified through a literature search, we finally selected 12 articles (545 participants). Compared with a control diet, an IFD was associated with a significant decline in BMI (WMD, -0.75 kg/m; 95% CI, -1.44 to -0.06), fasting glucose level (WMD, -4.16 mg/dL; 95% CI, -6.92 to -1.40), and homeostatic model assessment of  (WMD, -0.54; 95% CI, -1.05 to -0.03).

The Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance and  Study (ORIGINS) enrolled 230 diabetes-free adults (77% female) aged 20 to 55 y (mean ± SD, 34 ± 10 y) from whom baseline subgingival plaque and longitudinal FPG were measured. DNA was extracted from subgingival plaque, and V3 to V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced. FPG was measured at baseline and again at  y; glucose change was defined as follow-up minus baseline. Multivariable linear models regressed -y glucose change onto baseline measures of community diversity and abundances of 369 individual taxa. A microbial dysbiosis index (MDI) summarizing top individual taxa associated with glucose change was calculated and used in regression models. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking status, body mass index, and baseline glucose levels. Statistical significance was based on the false discovery rate (FDR; <0.05) or a Bonferroni-corrected  value of 1 × 10, derived from the initial 369 hypothesis tests for specific taxa. Mean -y FPG change was 1.5 ± 8 mg/dL. Baseline levels of 9 taxa predicted FPG change (all FDR <0.05), among which  sp oral taxon 097 and  spp predicted greater FPG change, while  sp oral taxon 498 predicted lesser FPG change (all 3  values, Bonferroni significant). The MDI explained 6% of variation in longitudinal glucose change ( < 0.001), and baseline glucose levels explained 10% of variation ( < 0.0001).

Whether one calls the underlying process 'genes vs. environment' or 'nature vs nurture', diabetes occurs at the interface of the two domains. Together with our genetic background we are born tabula rasa-a blank slate upon which the story of life, with all its environmental inputs will be written. There is one proviso: the influence of epigenetic inheritance must also be considered. Thus, in the creation of databases that include "big data" originating from genomic as well as exposome (defined as: the totality of environmental exposure from conception to death), a broad perspective is crucial as these factors act in concert in such chronic illnesses as diabetes that, for example, are likely to require adoption of an appropriate lifestyle change. Also, it is becoming increasingly evident that epigenetic factors can modulate the interplay between genes and environment. Consequently, throughout the life of an individual nature and nurture interact in a complex manner in the development of diabetes.

However, the association between VAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) with premature atherosclerosis and (i.e. arterial) inflammation is not completely understood. To provide more insight into this association, we investigated the association between arterial F-fluordeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) uptake, as a measure of arterial inflammation, and metabolic syndrome (MetS) markers in early T2DM patients.Forty-four patients with early T2DM, without glucose lowering medication, were studied (median age 63 [IQR 54-66] years, median BMI 30.4 [IQR 27.5-35.8]). Arterial inflammation was quantified using glucose corrected maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) FDG of the aorta, carotid, iliac, and femoral arteries, and corrected for background activity (blood pool) as target-to-background ratio (TBR). VAT and SAT volumes (cm) were automatically segmented using computed tomography (CT) between levels L1-L5. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was assessed by liver function test and CT.VAT volume, but not SAT volume, correlated with TBR (r = 0.325, p = 0.031). Linear regression models showed a significant association, even after sequential adjustment for potentially influencing MetS components. Interaction term VAT volume * sex and additional components including HbA1c, , NAFLD, adiponectin, leptin, and C- reactive protein (CRP) did not change the independent association between VAT volume and TBR.CT-assessed VAT volume is positively associated with FDG-PET assessed arterial inflammation, independently of factors thought to potentially mediate these effects. These findings suggest that VAT in contrast to SAT is linked to early atherosclerotic changes in T2DM patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Di-(-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), a widely used plasticizer, could exacerbate type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study aimed to investigate the metabolic toxicity, susceptibility and mechanism of DEHP exposure to A-T2DM. DEHP was administered orally (0, 0.18, 1.8, 18, and 180 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks to adolescent normal mice (A-normal mice) and established A-T2DM mice. The results of fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels showed that the susceptibility of A-T2DM mice to DEHP exposure was more significant than that of A-normal mice. DEHP, interfering with glucose and lipid metabolism of A-normal and A-T2DM mice, caused the body weight increase of A-normal mice and decrease of A-T2DM mice. Besides, DEHP could cause more injury of cardiovascular, hepatic and renal function to A-T2DM mice than A-normal mice. Hepatic transcriptome analysis revealed that DEHP exposure interfered with the biological feedback adjustment of endocrine and metabolic system in A-T2DM mice and then led to the development of T2DM. According to the transcriptome results,  signaling transduction pathway was applied and researched by immunoassay. It was discovered that DEHP reduced  sensitivity and disturbed  signaling transduction, glucose utilization, lipid synthesis and protein synthesis. Collectively, DEHP could disturb the endocrine and metabolic functions and increase the  in adolescent mice. Moreover, the adolescent T2DM mice are more sensitive to DEHP-induced endocrine and metabolic toxicity than the healthy adolescent mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627187>RabGAPs TBC1D1 and TBC1D4 in skeletal muscle function and exercise.</a></h1><p>The two closely related RabGAPs TBC1D1 and TBC1D4 are key signaling factors of skeletal muscle substrate utilization. In mice, deficiency in both RabGAPs leads to reduced skeletal muscle glucose transport in response to  and lower GLUT4 abundance. Conversely, Tbc1d1- and Tbc1d4-deficiency results in enhanced lipid use as fuel in skeletal muscle, through yet unknown mechanisms. In humans, variants in TBC1D1 and TBC1D4 are linked to obesity and  and type  diabetes. While the specific function in metabolism of each of the two RabGAPs remains to be determined, TBC1D1 emerges to be controlling exercise endurance and physical capacity whereas TBC1D4 may rather be responsible for maintaining muscle  sensitivity, muscle contraction, and exercise. There is growing evidence that TBC1D1 also plays an important role in skeletal muscle development, since it has been found to be associated to meat production traits in several livestock species. In addition, TBC1D1 protein abundance in skeletal muscle is regulated by both,  receptor and  like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor signaling. This review focusses on the specific roles of the two key signaling factors TBC1D1 and TBC1D4 in skeletal muscle metabolism, development and exercise physiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652915>Quantification of Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation in Metabolic Disease: Application to Type  Diabetes.</a></h1><p>Type  diabetes (T2D) is a growing health concern with nearly 400 million affected worldwide as of 2014. T2D presents with hyperglycemia and  resulting in increased risk for blindness, renal failure, nerve damage, and premature death. Skeletal muscle is a major site for  and is responsible for up to 80% of glucose uptake during euglycemic hyperglycemic clamps. Glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is driven by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and for this reason mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in T2D. In this review we integrate mitochondrial function with physiologic function to present a broader understanding of mitochondrial functional status in T2D utilizing studies from both human and rodent models. Quantification of mitochondrial function is explained both in vitro and in vivo highlighting the use of proper controls and the complications imposed by obesity and sedentary lifestyle. This review suggests that skeletal muscle mitochondria are not necessarily dysfunctional but limited oxygen supply to working muscle creates this misperception. Finally, we propose changes in experimental design to address this question unequivocally. If mitochondrial function is not impaired it suggests that therapeutic interventions and drug development must move away from the organelle and toward the cardiovascular system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656583>Recent advances in understanding lipodystrophy: a focus on lipodystrophy-associated cardiovascular disease and potential effects of leptin therapy on cardiovascular function.</a></h1><p>Lipodystrophy is a disease characterized by a partial or total absence of adipose tissue leading to severe metabolic derangements including marked , type  diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and steatohepatitis. Lipodystrophy is also a source of major cardiovascular disorders which, in addition to hepatic failure and infection, contribute to a significant reduction in life expectancy. Metreleptin, the synthetic analog of the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin and current therapy of choice for patients with lipodystrophy, successfully improves metabolic function. However, while leptin has been associated with hypertension, vascular diseases, and inflammation in the context of obesity, it remains unknown whether its daily administration could further impair cardiovascular function in patients with lipodystrophy. The goal of this short review is to describe the cardiovascular phenotype of patients with lipodystrophy, speculate on the etiology of the disorders, and discuss how the use of murine models of lipodystrophy could be beneficial to address the question of the contribution of leptin to lipodystrophy-associated cardiovascular disease.Copyright: © 2019 Bruder-Nascimento T et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608010>Mechanisms Underlying Type  Diabetes Remission After Metabolic Surgery.</a></h1><p>Type  diabetes prevalence is increasing dramatically worldwide. Metabolic surgery is the most effective treatment for selected patients with diabetes and/or obesity. When compared to intensive medical therapy and lifestyle intervention, metabolic surgery has shown superiority in achieving glycemic improvement, reducing number of medications and cardiovascular risk factors, which translates in long-term benefits on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms underlying diabetes improvement after metabolic surgery have not yet been clearly understood but englobe a complex interaction among improvements in beta cell function and  secretion,  sensitivity, intestinal gluconeogenesis, changes in glucose utilization, and absorption by the gut and changes in the secretory pattern and morphology of adipose tissue. These are achieved through different mediators which include an enhancement in gut hormones release, especially, glucagon-like peptide 1, changes in bile acids circulation, gut microbiome, and glucose transporters expression. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive appraisal of what is known so far to better understand the mechanisms through which metabolic surgery improves glycemic control facilitating future research in the field.Copyright © 2019 Pérez-Pevida, Escalada, Miras and Frühbeck.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653969>The TRPV2 cation channels: from urothelial cancer invasiveness to glioblastoma multiforme interactome signature.</a></h1><p>Changes in transient receptor potential (TRP) Ca permeable channels are associated with development and progression of different types of cancer. Herein, we report data relative to the expression and function of TRP vanilloid  (TRPV2) channels in cancer. Overexpression of TRPV2 is observed in high-grade urothelial cancers and treatment with the TRPV2 agonist cannabidiol induces apoptosis. In prostate cancer, TRPV2 promotes migration and invasion, and TRPV2 overexpression characterizes the castration-resistant phenotype. In breast cancer cells, inhibition of TRPV2 by tranilast reduces the -like growth factor-1 stimulated proliferation. TRPV2 overexpression in triple-negative breast cancer cells is associated with high recurrence-free survival. Increased TRPV2 overexpression is present in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma associated with advanced disease, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis. Increased TRPV2 transcripts have been found both in benign hepatoma and in hepatocarcinomas, where TRPV2 expression is associated with portal vein invasion and reduction of cancer stem cell expression. TRPV2 expression and function has been also evaluated in gliomagenesis. This receptor negatively controls survival, proliferation, and  to CD95- or BCNU-induced apoptosis. In glioblastoma stem cells, TRPV2 activation promotes differentiation and inhibits the proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In glioblastoma, the TRPV2 is part of an interactome-based signature complex, which is negatively associated with survival, and it is expressed in high risk of recurrence and temozolomide-resistant patients. Finally, also in hematological malignancies, such as myeloma or acute myeloid leukemia, TRPV2 might represent a target for novel therapeutic approaches. Overall, these findings demonstrate that TRPV2 exhibits an oncogenic activity in different types of cancers, controlling survival, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and invasion signaling pathways. Thus, it prompts the pharmacological use of TRPV2 targeting in the control of cancer progression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589549>Relationship Between Metabolic Syndrome and Beta-Cell Function in Nondiabetic Korean Premenopausal and Postmenopausal Women: 2015 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.</a></h1><p> This study was conducted to assess the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and beta-cell function in nondiabetic Korean women.  This study included ,507 women (premenopausal women, 1,359; postmenopausal women, 1,148) who were aged ≥20 and used 2015 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data.  Key study results were as follows: first, in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women, after adjusting for related variables [except body mass index (BMI)], MetS ( < 0.001) and metabolic syndrome score (MSS;  < 0.001) were positively associated with the homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-B) levels. Second, in premenopausal women, when further adjusted for BMI, MetS ( = 0.002) and MSS ( < 0.001) were also positively associated with HOMA-B levels. However, in postmenopausal women, when further adjusting for BMI, the associations of MetS ( = 0.322) or MSS ( = 0.855) and HOMA-B levels were no longer significant.  Metabolic syndrome was positively associated with beta-cell function in nondiabetic Korean premenopausal women, but not in Korean postmenopausal women.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593505>The exocyst complex regulates -stimulated glucose uptake of skeletal muscle cells</a></h1><p>Skeletal muscle handles about 80-90% of the -induced glucose uptake. In skeletal muscle,  binding to its cell surface receptor triggers redistribution of intracellular glucose transporter GLUT4 protein to the cell surface, enabling facilitated glucose uptake. In adipocytes, the eight-protein exocyst complex is an indispensable constituent in -induced glucose uptake, as it is responsible for the targeted trafficking and plasma membrane-delivery of GLUT4. However, the role of the exocyst in skeletal muscle glucose uptake has never been investigated. Here we demonstrate that the exocyst is a necessary factor in -induced glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells as well. The exocyst complex colocalizes with GLUT4 storage vesicles in L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts at a basal state and associates with these vesicles during their translocation to the plasma membrane after  signaling. Moreover, we show that the exocyst inhibitor endosidin- (ES2) and a heterozygous knockout of EXOC5 in skeletal myoblast cells both lead to impaired GLUT4 trafficking to the plasma membrane and hinder glucose uptake in response to an  stimulus. Our research is the first to establish that the exocyst complex regulates -induced GLUT4 exocytosis and glucose metabolism in muscle cells. A deeper knowledge of the role of the exocyst complex in skeletal muscle tissue may help our understanding of  in type  diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620011>Android Fat Deposition and Its Association With Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Overweight Young Males.</a></h1><p>Excess adiposity increases the risk of type- diabetes and cardiovascular disease development. Beyond the simple level of adiposity, the pattern of fat distribution may influence these risks. We sought to examine if higher android fat distribution was associated with different hemodynamic, metabolic or vascular profile compared to a lower accumulation of android fat deposits in young overweight males.Forty-six participants underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and were stratified into two groups. Group 1: low level of android fat (<9.5%) and group : high level of android fat (>9.5%). Assessments comprised measures of plasma lipid and glucose profile, blood pressure, endothelial function [reactive hyperemia index (RHI)] and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA).There were no differences in weight, BMI, total body fat and lean mass between the two groups. Glucose tolerance and  (fasting plasma ) were impaired in group  ( < 0.05). Levels of plasma triglycerides and 5 lipid species were higher in group  ( < 0.05). Endothelial function was less in group  (RHI: 1.64 vs. .26,  = 0.003) and heart rate was higher (76 vs. 67 bpm,  = 0.004). No difference occurred in MSNA nor blood pressure between the  groups.Preferential fat accumulation in the android compartment is associated with increased cardiovascular and metabolic risk via alteration of endothelial function.Copyright © 2019 Sari, Eikelis, Head, Schlaich, Meikle, Lambert and Lambert.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670618>Metformin: Up to Date.</a></h1><p>Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic agent extensively used as first-line therapy for type  diabetes.

Besides its metabolic positive effects, Metformin has direct effects on inflammation and can have immunomodulatory and antineoplastic properties.The aim of this narrative review was to summarize the up-to-date evidence from the current literature about the metabolic and non-metabolic effects of Metformin.We reviewed the current literature dealing with different effects and properties of Metformin and current recommendations about the use of this drug. We identified keywords and MeSH terms in Pubmed and the terms Metformin and type  diabetes, type 1 diabetes, pregnancy, heart failure, PCOS, etc, were searched, selecting only significant original articles and review in English, in particular of the last five years.Even if many new effective hypoglycemic agents have been launched in the market in the last few years, Metformin would always keep a place in the treatment of type  diabetes and its comorbidities because of its multiple positive effects and low cost.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657258>Serum Lipopolysaccharide-Binding Protein Levels and the Incidence of Cardiovascular Disease in a General Japanese Population: The Hisayama Study.</a></h1><p>Background Epidemiological studies have reported a link between serum LBP (lipopolysaccharide-binding protein) levels and lifestyle-related diseases. However, there have been no longitudinal studies investigating the association of serum LBP levels and the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in general populations. Methods and Results A total of 2568 community-dwelling Japanese individuals 40 years and older without prior CVD were followed for 10 years (2002-2012). Serum LBP levels were divided into quartiles (quartile 1: .20-9.68 μg/mL; quartile : 9.69-10.93 μg/mL; quartile 3: 10.94-12.40 μg/mL; quartile 4: 12.41-24.34 μg/mL). The hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% CIs for the incidence of CVD were computed using a Cox proportional hazards model. During the follow-up period, 180 individuals developed CVD. The age- and sex-adjusted cumulative incidence of CVD increased significantly with higher serum LBP levels ( for trend=0.005). Individuals with higher serum LBP levels had a significantly greater risk of the development of CVD after adjusting for conventional cardiovascular risk factors (quartile 1: HR, 1.00 [reference]; quartile : HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.60-1.78]; quartile 3: HR, 1.52 [95% CI, 0.92-.51]; and quartile 4: HR, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.17-3.09];  for trend=0.01). This association remained significant after additional adjustment for homeostasis model assessment of  ( for trend=0.01). However, when additional adjustment was made for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, the association was attenuated to the nonsignificant level ( for trend=0.08). Conclusions The present findings suggest that higher serum LBP levels are associated with increased risk of the development of CVD in the general Japanese population. Low-grade endotoxemia may contribute to the pathogenesis of CVD through chronic systemic inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658625> Receptor Trafficking: Consequences for  Sensitivity and Diabetes.</a></h1><p> receptor (INSR) has been extensively studied in the area of cell proliferation and energy metabolism. Impaired INSR activities lead to , the key factor in the pathology of metabolic disorders including type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The mainstream opinion is that  begins at a post-receptor level. The role of INSR activities and trafficking in  pathogenesis has been largely ignored. Ligand-activated INSR is internalized and trafficked to early endosome (EE), where INSR is dephosphorylated and sorted. INSR can be subsequently conducted to lysosome for degradation or recycled back to the plasma membrane. The metabolic fate of INSR in cellular events implies the profound influence of INSR on  signaling pathways. Disruption of INSR-coupled activities has been identified in a wide range of -related diseases such as T2DM. Accumulating evidence suggests that alterations in INSR trafficking may lead to severe . However, there is very little understanding of how altered INSR activities undermine complex signaling pathways to the development of  and T2DM. Here, we focus this review on summarizing previous findings on the molecular pathways of INSR trafficking in normal and diseased states.

Based on their chemical structure, PCBs are classified into non-ortho-substituted and ortho-substituted congeners. Non-ortho-substituted PCBs are structurally similar to dioxin and their toxic effects and mode of action are well established. In contrast, very little is known about the effects of ortho-substituted PCBs, particularly during early development. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of exposure to an environmentally prominent ortho-substituted PCB (,',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl; PCB153) on zebrafish embryos. We exposed zebrafish embryos to three different concentrations of PCB153 starting from 4 hours post-fertilization (hpf) to 120 hpf. We quantified gross morphological changes, behavioral phenotypes, gene expression changes and circadian behavior in the larvae. There were no developmental defects during the exposure period, but starting at 7 dpf, we observed spinal deformity in the 10 μM PCB153 treated group. A total of 633, 2227, and 3378 differentially expressed genes were observed in 0.1 μM (0.036 μg/mL), 1 μM (0.36 μg/mL) and 10 μM (3.6 μg/mL) PCB153 treated embryos, respectively. Of these, 301 genes were common to all treatment groups. KEGG pathway analysis revealed enrichment of genes related to circadian rhythm, FoxO signaling and  pathways. Behavioral analysis revealed that PCB153 exposure significantly alters circadian behavior. Disruption of circadian rhythms has been associated with the development of metabolic and neurological diseases. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of action of environmental chemicals in disrupting metabolism and other physiological processes is essential.© The Author(s) 2019.

Previous studies investigating the diabetogenic effects of TAC have focused on the β cells of islets. In this study, we found that TAC contributed to NODAT through directly affecting hepatic metabolic homeostasis. In mice, TAC induced hypoglycemia rather than hyperglycemia during starvation via suppressing gluconeogenetic genes, suggesting the limitation of fasting blood glucose in the diagnosis of NODAT. In addition, TAC caused hepatic  and triglyceride accumulation through IRS2/AKT and SREBP1 signaling, respectively. Furthermore, we found a pivotal role of CRTC2 in TAC-induced metabolic disorders. The restoration of hepatic CRTC2 alleviated the metabolic disorders through its downstream molecules (e.g., PCK1, IRS2, and SREBP1). Consistent with the findings from bench, low CRTC2 expression in graft hepatocytes was an independent risk factor for NODAT (OR = .692, P = 0.023, n = 135). Integrating grafts' CRTC2 score into the clinical model could significantly increase the predictive capacity (AUCs: 0.71 vs. 0.79, P = 0.048). Taken together, in addition to its impact on pancreatic cells, TAC induces 'hepatogenous diabetes' via CRTC2 signaling. Liver-targeted management may be of help to prevent or heal TAC-associated diabetes.© 2019 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606349>Current and future aspects of several adjunctive treatment strategies in polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h1><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age. PCOS is characterized by hyperandrogenism, menstrual disorders, and polycystic ovarian morphology. PCOS patients have an increased risk of type  diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and infertility. The mechanism of PCOS is not yet fully understood, but  and genetic factors may play distinct roles in the pathomechanism. There is ongoing research on new therapeutic modalities for women with PCOS. In this minireview, we assessed the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of selected adjunctive agents (metformin, statins, resveratrol, melatonin, and inositols) for the treatment of women with PCOS. Metformin is a safe medication used in PCOS for 25 years that is currently recommended in select PCOS subpopulations, such as adolescents, women with metabolic disorders, and infertility infertile women undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation. Statins are also suggested in PCOS therapy, as these compounds decrease testosterone concentrations, improve lipid profiles, and ameliorate inflammatory reactions. Despite promising results, the role of statins in PCOS management needs to be further validated. Dietary supplements have also been tested in PCOS patients. Resveratrol was shown to decrease total testosterone production and improve fasting  but, until recently, only in one randomized study. Data on the therapeutic efficacy of melatonin and inositols on endocrine and metabolic abnormalities are limited and inconclusive. The multifactorial etiology of PCOS makes tailoring of its treatment more demanding, and there is a constant need for causative and effective modes of PCOS therapy.Copyright © 2019.

We have designed this study to compare the effects of weight reduction on histological activity and fibrosis of lean and non-lean NASH.We have included 20 lean and 20 non-lean histologically proven NASH patients. BMI < 25 kg/m2 was defined as non-lean. Informed consent was taken from each subject. All methods were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Moderate exercise along with dietary restriction was advised for both groups for weight reduction. After 1 year, 16 non-lean and 15 lean had completed second liver biopsy.Age, sex, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltrasferase (GGT), Homeostasis model assessment  (HOMA-IR), triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) was similar in both groups. Steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) and fibrosis was similar in the two groups. In lean/non-lean group, any amount of weight reduction, ≥ 5% weight reduction and ≥ 7% weight reduction was found in respectively 8/11, 5/6 and /6 patients. In both lean and non-lean groups, weight reduction of any amount was associated with significant reduction of steatosis, ballooning and NAS, except lobular inflammation and fibrosis. In both groups, weight reduction of ≥ 5% was associated with significant reduction in NAS only. However, significant improvement in NAS was noted with ≥ 7% weight reduction in non-lean group only.Smaller amount of weight reduction had the good benefit of improvement in all the segments of histological activity in both lean and non-lean NASH.© 2019 Shahinul Alam, Mohammad Jahid Hasan, Md.

Special emphasis is given also on intriguing insights into the relationship between obesity and BC as well as on the role of novel adipokines in BC development.Recent evidence has underscored the role of the triad of obesity, , and adipokines in postmenopausal BC. Adipokines exert independent and joint effects on activation of major intracellular signal networks implicated in BC cell proliferation, growth, survival, invasion, and metastasis, particularly in the context of obesity, considered a systemic endocrine dysfunction characterized by chronic inflammation. To date, more than 10 adipokines have been linked to BC, and this catalog is continuously increasing. The majority of circulating adipokines, such as leptin, resistin, visfatin, apelin, lipocalin , osteopontin, and oncostatin M, is elevated in BC, while some adipokines such as adiponectin and irisin (adipo-myokine) are generally decreased in BC and considered protective against breast carcinogenesis. Further evidence from basic and translational research is necessary to delineate the ontological role of adipokines and their interplay in BC pathogenesis. More large-scale clinical and longitudinal studies are awaited to assess their clinical utility in BC prognosis and follow-up.

However, the protective role of DASH dietary patterns in development of CKD, as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), remains inconsistent in the literature. The aim of the current systematic review was to summarize the findings of previous observational studies and quantify the potential association between DASH dietary patterns and the risk of CKD using meta-analysis.A comprehensive search was done with the use of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Sciences, and Scopus databases to find relevant articles published prior to June 2019. Search terms included: ([Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension] OR [DASH]) AND ([Kidney Failure, Chronic] OR [Renal Insufficiency, Chronic] OR [Chronic Kidney Disease], OR [CKD] OR [End-Stage Renal Disease] OR [ESRD] OR [Kidney] OR [Renal]). To pool the risk estimates, fixed-effects and random-effects models were applied. Cochrane Q test was performed to detect sources of heterogeneity among the included studies.Out of the seven studies included in the systematic review, six were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The total sample size was 568,213 participants including 16,694 cases of CKD. Combined risk estimates for  cross-sectional and 4 prospective cohort studies showed an inverse association between DASH dietary patterns and risk of CKD (Pooled risk estimate: 0.77, 95% CI 0.63-0.94; p = 0.01). Stratified analysis showed a marginally significant relationship between DASH dietary patterns and risk of CKD in prospective cohort studies (Pooled risk estimate: 0.79, 95% CI 0.61-1.01; p = 0.05), and no significant association in cross-sectional studies (Pooled risk estimate: 0.71, 95% CI 0.38-1.34; p = 0.29), respectively. A significant association was observed between DASH dietary patterns and risk of CKD in the studies extracted DASH based on nutrients (Pooled risk estimate: 0.78, 95% CI 0.63-0.97; p = 0.02), compared to the studies extracted DASH based on food groups (Pooled risk estimate: 0.66, 95% CI 0.28-1.58; p = 0.35).The results of the present study showed a significant inverse association between DASH dietary patterns and the risk of developing CKD. Adherence to DASH dietary patterns might have protective effects against CKD development and progression. Further research is required to confirm the certainty of estimates.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism. All rights reserved.</p></html>
