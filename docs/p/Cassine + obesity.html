Such mediators contribute to oxidative stress and alter inflammatory processes in adipose tissue, leading to insulin resistance during . Thus, the identification of natural compounds such as plant polyphenols able to increase the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity of the body is of high interest. We aimed to evaluate the biological properties of polyphenol-rich extracts from the medicinal plants A. borbonica, D. apetalum and G. mauritiana on preadipocytes exposed to H2O2, TNFα or LPS mediators.Medicinal plant extracts were analysed for their polyphenol contents by Folin-Ciocalteu and UPLC-ESI-MS methods as well as for their free radical-scavenging activities by DPPH and ORAC assays. To assess the ability of polyphenol-rich extracts to protect 3T3-L1 preadipocytes against H2O2, TNFα or LPS mediators, several parameters including cell viability (MTT and LDH assays), ROS production (DCFH-DA test), IL-6 and MCP-1 secretion (ELISA) were evaluated. Moreover, the expression of superoxide dismutase, catalase and NF-κB genes was explored (RT-QPCR).All medicinal plants exhibited high levels of polyphenols with free radical-scavenging capacities. Flavonoids such as quercetin, kaempferol, epicatechin and procyanidins, and phenolic acids derived from caffeic acid including chlorogenic acid, were detected. Polyphenol-rich plant extracts did not exert a cytotoxic effect on preadipocytes but protected them against H2O2 anti-proliferative action. Importantly, they down-regulated ROS production and the secretion of IL-6 and MCP-1 pro-inflammatory markers induced by H2O2, TNFα and LPS mediators. Such a protective action was associated with an increase in superoxide dismutase antioxidant enzyme gene expression and a decrease in mRNA levels of NF-κB pro-inflammatory transcription factor.This study highlights that antioxidant strategies based on polyphenols derived from medicinal plants tested could contribute to regulate adipose tissue redox status and immune process, and thus participate to the improvement of -related oxidative stress and inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26990279>A pilot randomized controlled trial of telephone-based cognitive behavioural therapy for preoperative bariatric surgery patients.</a></h2><p>Psychosocial interventions can improve eating behaviours and psychosocial functioning in bariatric surgery candidates. However, those that involve face-to-face sessions are problematic for individuals with severe  due to mobility issues and practical barriers.To examine the efficacy of a pre-operative telephone-based cognitive behavioural therapy (Tele-CBT) intervention versus standard pre-operative care for improving eating psychopathology and psychosocial functioning.Preoperative bariatric surgery patients (N = 47) were randomly assigned to receive standard preoperative care (n = 24) or 6 sessions of Tele-CBT (n = 23).Retention was 74.5% at post-intervention. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that the Tele-CBT group reported significant improvements on the Binge Eating Scale (BES), t (22) = 2.81, p = .01, Emotional Eating Scale (EES), t (22) = 3.44, p = .002, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), t (22) = 2.71, p = .01, whereas the standard care control group actually reported significant increases on the EES, t (23) = 4.86, p < .001, PHQ-9, t (23) = 2.75, p = .01, and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), t (23) = 2.93, p = .008 over the same time period.Tele-CBT holds promise as a brief intervention for improving eating psychopathology and depression in bariatric surgery candidates.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report the initial validation and reliability studies of the Bariatric Interprofessional Psychosocial Assessment Suitability Scale (BIPASS) and its relationship to interdisciplinary psychosocial assessment practices for BS.This study was conducted at the Toronto Western Hospital, a Level 1A BS center of excellence accredited by the American College of Surgeons. Phase I: a total of 4 blinded raters applied the BIPASS to 31 randomly selected BS cases referred to our program to establish interrater reliability. Phase II: in all, 3 raters with clinical experience in bariatric psychosocial care applied the BIPASS to 54 randomly selected BS cases.In total, 46 of 54 (85.1%) patients were women. The median age of all patient cases was 49 years (range: 21-74). Raters׳ BIPASS scores ranged from 4-52 (median = 19.24, standard deviation =10.38). BIPASS scores were highly predictive of the BS psychosocial outcome (area under curve = 0.915; 95% CI: 0.844-0.985; p < 0.001). A BIPASS score of ≥16 was chosen as the cutoff score for further clinical assessment before proceeding with surgical evaluation based on a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (sensitivity = 0.839; specificity = 0.783). The instrument has very good interrater reliability (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.847) even among novice raters.The findings show that the BIPASS is a comprehensive screening tool in the psychosocial assessment of BS candidates, which standardizes the evaluation process and systematically identify at-risk patients for negative outcomes after BS.Copyright © 2016 The Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine.

The current pilot study evaluated the impact of Adapted Motivational Interviewing (AMI) on patients' readiness for change, self-efficacy, and adherence to dietary guidelines following bariatric surgery.A randomized wait-list controlled trial was conducted. Post-operative bariatric patients (N=51) were randomly allocated to receive the single session AMI intervention either immediately (AMI group; n=23), or in 12weeks while continuing to receive standard bariatric care (wait list control [WLC] group; n=28).Completer analyses (n=44) indicated that participants reported improvements in readiness, confidence, and self-efficacy for change immediately following the AMI intervention. They also reported improvements in binge eating symptomatology and some measures of dietary adherence across the 12-week follow-up period. Significant Group×Time interactions for confidence for change, dietary adherence, and binge eating symptomatology suggest that the AMI group improved on these outcomes whereas the control group did not.These preliminary findings suggest that AMI is an acceptable and feasible intervention with the potential to improve bariatric patients' confidence for change and eating behaviors. Future research should examine these results in comparison to routinely collected postsurgery follow-up data to learn more about AMI's efficacy for improving post-surgical adherence.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), can be challenging to access due to physical limitations and practical barriers. Telephone-based CBT (Tele-CBT) can improve eating psychopathology and psychological distress before and after surgery. Given the frequent occurrence/recurrence of problematic eating-related and psychological issues many patients face 1-year post-surgery, this open-trial pilot study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Tele-CBT delivered 1-year post-surgery as an adjunctive treatment to the usual standard of bariatric care.Patients (n=43) received six 1-h Tele-CBT sessions delivered weekly beginning at 1-year post-surgery. Patients completed questionnaire packages before and after the intervention to assess changes in binge eating (BES), emotional eating (EES), depression (PHQ-9), and anxiety (GAD-7).Thirty-two patients completed Tele-CBT yielding a 74.4% completion rate. Participants reported significant improvements on the Binge Eating Scale (t(31)=3.794, p=0.001), Emotional Eating Scale (t(31)=3.508, p=0.001), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item Scale (z=-2.371, p=0.018), and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 Item Scale (z=-3.546, p<0.001) immediately following Tele-CBT.The results demonstrate that Tele-CBT delivered 1-year post-surgery may improve binge eating, emotional eating, depression, and anxiety. Additional research is warranted to examine whether these changes translate into long-term improvements in bariatric surgery outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of .

Due to the increased incidence of , Bariatric surgery has been recognized as one of the treatment options. Despite the success of Bariatric surgery, studies have proposed that it has neglected the contributions of other factors, such as psychological factors in the causation as well as the maintenance of  amongst individuals. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is largely a psychosocial intervention that has been shown to be efficacious, as studies have demonstrated that even brief CBT interventions could help in the reduction of binge eating and maintenance of weight loss. Previously identified problems with regards to the integration and the provision of such interventions include that of geographical barriers. In order to overcome the geographical barriers, telephone-based CBT has been conceptualized. Over the past decade, there has been massive advancement and development in Internet, Web-based and smartphone technologies, but there is still a paucity of applications in this area.Our current research objective is to determine if bariatric surgery patients will be receptive towards an online and smartphone based CBT intervention.The Bariatric Surgery Online CBT portal and Smartphone companion application was developed between July 2013 and December 2013. A low-cost methodology of developing the online portal was adopted. In terms of development, 4 core development phases were adopted. These included that of: a) Formulation of users' requirements, b) System design and development, c) System evaluation and d) System deployment and pilot application. The bariatric surgery workgroup from the Toronto Western Hospital helped with the recruitment of the subjects from the outpatient specialist service. Links to the web-portal was provided to each of the participants recruited.Since the inception of the online portal to date, in terms of usage rates, there have been a total of 2408 visitors to the online portal. The majority of the visitors are from Canada (n= 1879). From the analytics, a total of 8 users have participated in the pre-assessment questionnaire and have attempted and tried to use the individual modules. Since the inception of the pilot study from January 2014 till October 2014, 4 individuals have completed at least 3 modules available on the online portal.This is one of the first few studies that have demonstrated the potential feasibility of having an online and smartphone cognitive behavioral portal to serve the psychological needs of bariatric surgery patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25248509>Employment outcomes one year after bariatric surgery: the role of patient and psychosocial factors.</a></h2><p>Patients undergoing bariatric surgery generally report improved work performance after this procedure; however, previous research has been limited by a lack of standardized employment measures and a failure to account for the impact of psychiatric illness on employment outcomes. To address these limitations, this study aims to assess changes in patients' employment impairment and productivity 12 months post-surgery and to identify psychosocial predictors of change in employment outcomes.A total of 164 patients underwent bariatric surgery between February 2010 and November 2012 in this prospective cohort study. The primary outcome was a change in employment impairment (EI) as measured by total Lam Employment Absence and Productivity Scale (LEAPS) scores and changes in participants' job status category. Multiple linear regression models assessed whether baseline demographic or clinical factors, including a history of psychiatric illness and changes in depressive, anxiety and quality of life (QOL) symptoms, were associated with a change in LEAPS scores.Participants reported a significant reduction in EI post-surgery (p < 0.0001) and improvement in work productivity (p < 0.0001) 12 months after surgery. Only changes in depression (confidence interval (CI) 0.46, 0.76, p < 0.0001), anxiety (CI 0.49, 0.85, p < 0.0001) and mental QOL (CI -0.30, -0.17, p < 0.0001) were significant predictors of change in EI total scores. Logistic regression analysis did not identify significant predictors of change in participant job status.Patients with pre-bariatric surgery psychiatric distress are more likely to report greater employment impairment and worse employment productivity pre-surgery. These patients also experience the greatest improvements in post-surgery employment functioning.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28807141>Psychosocial predictors of quality of life and weight loss two years after bariatric surgery: Results from the Toronto Bari-PSYCH study.</a></h2><p>Studies exploring the impact of pre-surgery psychiatric status as a predictor of health related quality of life (QOL) after bariatric surgery have been limited to short-term follow-up and variable use of psychosocial measures. We examined the effect of pre-operative psychiatric factors on QOL and weight loss 2-years after surgery.156 patients participated in this prospective cohort study, the Toronto Bariatric Psychosocial Cohort Study, between 2010 and 2014. Patients were assessed pre-surgery for demographic factors, weight, psychiatric diagnosis using the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview and symptom measures for QOL, depression and anxiety at pre-surgery and at 1 and 2years post-surgery.At 2-years post-bariatric surgery, patients experienced a significant decrease in mean weight (-48.43kg, 95% [-51.1, -45.76]) and an increase only in physical QOL (+18.91, 95% [17.01, 20.82]) scores as compared to pre-surgery. Multivariate regression analysis identified pre-surgery physical QOL score (p<0.001), younger age (p=0.005), and a history of a mood disorder as significant predictors of physical QOL. Only a history of a mood disorder (p=0.032) significantly predicted mental QOL (p=0.006). Pre-surgery weight (p<0.001) and a history of a mood disorder (p=0.047) were significant predictors of weight loss 2-years post-surgery.Bariatric surgery had a sustained impact on physical QOL but not mental QOL at 2-years post-surgery. A history of mood disorder unexpectedly increased physical QOL scores and weight loss following surgery. Further research is needed to determine if these results are due to bariatric surgery candidate selection within this program.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We also assessed the impact of post-operative eating psychopathology on weight outcomes.Eight hundred forty-four patients participated in this prospective cohort study. Demographic factors, self-report measures of eating pathology (BES, NEQ, EES, EDE-Q), and weights (kg) were collected pre-surgery and annually for 3 years after surgery.The severity of problematic eating behaviors decreased after surgery and remained lower than baseline throughout follow-up. An increase was noted in binge eating scores (change in mean score ± SD = 0.85 ± 4.71; p = 0.002), emotional eating scores (2.00 ± 13.63; p = 0.033), and loss of control eating scores (1.11 ± 7.01; p < 0.001) after the first post-operative year that continued to the third post-operative year. There was also an increase in night eating scores between 2 and 3 years post-surgery (2.52 ± 8.00; p = 0.01). Higher 1-year post-operative binge eating scores were a significant predictor of lower 2-year % total weight loss (β = - 0.39, confidence interval (CI) - 1.23, - 0.16, p = 0.012).The severity of problematic eating behaviors decrease after bariatric surgery, but increase significantly between the first and third post-operative years. Binge Eating Scale score at 1 year post-surgery was the only significant predictor of reduced percent total weight loss at 2 years.

In addition to sustained weight loss, bariatric surgery can result in improvements in mental and physical health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and, consequently, work capacity. The purpose of our study was to evaluate changes to employment impairment (EI) and related HRQOL in patients 2 years post-bariatric surgery.Prospective data was collected on a cohort of 211 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. The Lam Employment Absence and Productivity Scale (LEAPS) and the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) were used to assess pre- and post-operative EI and physical and mental HRQOL, respectively. Predictors of work impairment changes were analyzed via multiple regression analysis and included demographic variables, history of psychiatric illness, and depression and anxiety self-report measures.Significant improvements in employment outcomes 2 years following surgery were noted with 68% of participants reporting an overall decrease in EI (total LEAPS score change = - 2.43 ± 5.76, p < 0.001), and 44% participants reporting an increase in work productivity (LEAPS productivity score change = - 0.67 ± 2.38, p < 0.001). Bariatric surgery was also associated with significant improvements in physical (change = 17.41 ± 10.72, p < 0.001) and mental (change = 2.67 ± 12.89, p = 0.001). Improvements in HRQOL predicted improvements in work-related impairment and productivity, while history of psychiatric illness predicted was associated with reduced improvement in work productivity.Our results provide further evidence of improvement in work productivity and reduction in EI post-bariatric surgery.

They appear to share many of the same correlates, including broader eating disorder psychopathology, body/shape/weight concerns, depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, and third-wave (e.g., acceptance, mindfulness) therapies appear effective in improving binge eating, loss of control eating, emotional eating, associated features (e.g., weight and shape concerns), and psychological distress (e.g., depression). Certain forms of disordered eating are elevated among individuals with excess weight, and psychosocial interventions have been found effective in improving symptomatology. Empirical research examining the efficacy of treatments for food addiction is lacking, and greatly needed given both its rate and controversy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27491293>A Pilot Study on Telephone Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Patients Six-Months Post-Bariatric Surgery.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a post-operative telephone-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention (Tele-CBT) in improving eating pathology and psychosocial functioning.Six-month post-operative bariatric surgery patients (n = 19) received six sessions of Tele-CBT. Study outcome variables included binge eating (BES), emotional eating (EES), depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), and anxiety symptoms (GAD-7).Retention was 73.7 % post-intervention. Tele-CBT resulted in significant reductions in mean difference scores on BES, EES-Total, EES-Anxiety, EES-Anger, PHQ9, and GAD7. Tele-CBT patients experienced a mean weight loss of 8.62 ± 15.02 kg between 6-months post-surgery (pre-Tele-CBT) and 12-months post-surgery.These preliminary results suggest that post-surgery Tele-CBT is feasible and can improve post-surgery symptoms of psychopathology in this uncontrolled study, supporting the need for a randomized controlled trial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447318>Psychosocial Predictors of Response to Telephone-Based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy in Bariatric Surgery Patients.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery is an empirically supported treatment for severe ; however, it does not directly target underlying behavioural and psychological factors that potentially contribute to . Mounting evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for improving eating psychopathology and psychological distress among bariatric patients, and telephone-based CBT (Tele-CBT) is a novel delivery method that increases treatment accessibility.This study aimed to identify demographic and clinical predictors of response to Tele-CBT among 79 patients who received Tele-CBT in 3 previous studies. Listwise deletion was applied, after which 58 patients were included in a multivariate linear regression adjusted for age, sex and education status, to evaluate patient rurality index (urban or nonurban), and baseline binge eating, emotional eating and depression symptoms, as predictors of tele-CBT response.The predictors explained 31% of the observed variance [R=0.312, F(4,57)=3.238, p<0.01]. Patient rurality index (beta=0.341, p<0.01) was the only statistically significant predictor of Tele-CBT response.Given the limited psychosocial resources available in many bariatric surgery programs, the findings suggest that Tele-CBT may be particularly beneficial for patients residing in nonurban communities with limited access to other health-care services.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Diabetes Association.

Attachment style is an important variable affecting eating psychopathology among individuals with . To date, studies examining eating psychopathology and attachment style in bariatric surgery populations have been limited to pre-surgery samples and cross-sectional study design. The current prospective study sought to determine whether attachment insecurity is associated with binge eating, emotional eating, and weight loss outcomes at 2-years post-surgery. Patients ( = 108) completed questionnaires on attachment style (ECR-16), binge eating (BES), emotional eating (EES), depression (PHQ-9), and anxiety (GAD-7). Multivariate linear regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between attachment insecurity and 2-years post-surgery disordered eating and percent total weight loss. Female gender was found to be a significant predictor of binge eating ( = 0.007) and emotional eating ( = 0.023) at 2-years post-surgery. Avoidant attachment ( = 0.009) was also found to be a significant predictor of binge eating at 2-years post-surgery.

In comparison to research examining the construct of food addiction and its validity, relatively little research has examined the broader implications of food addiction. The purpose of the current scoping review was to examine the potential ethical, stigma, and health policy implications of food addiction. Major themes were identified in the literature, and extensive overlap was identified between several of the themes. Ethics sub-themes related primarily to individual responsibility and included: (i) personal control, will power, and choice; and (ii) blame and weight bias. Stigma sub-themes included: (i) the impact on self-stigma and stigma from others, (ii) the differential impact of substance use disorder versus behavioral addiction on stigma, and (iii) the additive stigma of addiction plus  and/or eating disorder. Policy implications were broadly derived from comparisons to the tobacco industry and focused on addictive foods as opposed to food addiction. This scoping review underscored the need for increased awareness of food addiction and the role of the food industry, empirical research to identify specific hyperpalatable food substances, and policy interventions that are not simply extrapolated from tobacco.</p></html>
