Neural stem cell (NSC) is being scrutinized as a promising cell replacement therapy for various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the unfavorable niche at the site of degenerative disease is hostile to the survival and differentiation of transplanted cells. Here, we undertook in vitro and in vivo works to examine whether a designer self-assemble peptide (DSP), which contains one functional domain --Gly-Ser-Arg (YIGSR) derived from laminin, promotes the survival and neuronal differentiation of NSC and behavioral improvement. We found that DSP could undergo spontaneous assembly into well-ordered nanofibers, and it not only facilitated the cell viability in normal culture condition, but also decreased the number of apoptotic cells induced by Aβ in vitro. NSC seeded in DSP showed much more neuronal differentiation than that seeded in self-assemble peptide (SP) or alone. In the AD model, NSC transplantation in DSP-treated AD rats demonstrated much more obvious cognitive rescue with restoration of learning/memory function compared with NSC transplantation in SP, NSC alone, or DSP alone treated ones. Interestingly, DSP enhanced the survival and neuronal differentiation of transplanted NSC. Apoptosis levels in the CA1 region and Aβ level in the hippocampus were significantly decreased in the group of NSC transplantation in DSP. Moreover, synaptic function, indicated by the expression of pre-synaptic protein synapsin-1, was restored and the secretion of anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic factors were increased, such as IL-10, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), while the expression of pro-inflammatory factors were decreased, such as TNF-α and IL-1β. These data firstly unveiled that the biomaterial DSP can maximize the therapeutic benefits of NSC transplantation for AD through improving the survival and differentiation of transplanted stem cells and promoting the effects of neuroprotection, anti-neuroinflammatory and paracrine action. Our results may have important clinical implications for the design of future NSC-based strategies using the biomaterials for various neurodegenerative diseases including AD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29309861>Protective effects of diketopiperazines from Moslae Herba against influenza A virus-induced pulmonary  via inhibition of viral replication and platelets aggregation.</a></h1><p>Moslae Herba (MH) is broadly used as an antiviral, antipyretic and anticoagulant drug which effectively treats respiratory diseases including cough, asthma, throat, cold and flu.The excessive  of the lungs is the hallmark of severe influenza A virus (IAV) infection, while platelet aggregation and its subsequent microvascular thrombosis can exacerbate IAV-induced lung injury. Thus, inhibition of platelet aggregation can be a potential target for IAV treatment. Previous studies focus on the flavonoids from MH and their anti-inflammatory activities, but the anticoagulant compounds and potential molecular mechanism of MH remains unclear. This study was to isolate and characterize diketopiperazines (DKPs) from MH and to explore the underlying anticoagulant mechanism on IAV infection models.EtOAc sub-extract separated from MH ethanolic extract was subjected to fractionation through column chromatography. The chemical structures of pure compounds were characterized by the spectral analysis. Antiviral activities of DKPs were assayed in IAV-infected Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and mice. Anticoagulant effects of DKPs were investigated on adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP)-induced acute pulmonary embolism and IAV-induced lung injury in vivo, as well as the inhibition on platelet activating factor (PAF), arachidonic acid (AA) and ADP-induced platelet aggregation in vitro. The serum levels of thromboxane B (TXB) and 6-keto-PGF were detected by ELISA. The expressions of key proteins in CD41-mediated PI3K/AKT pathways were determined by western blotting analysis.Six DKPs were, for the first time, isolated from MH and identified as cyclo(-Leu) (1), cyclo(Phe-Phe) (2), cyclo(Phe-) (3), cyclo(Ala-) (4), cyclo(Ala-Leu) (5) and Bz-Phe-Phe-OMe (6). Among these DKPs, cyclo(Ala-) and Bz-Phe-Phe-OMe possessed low cytotoxicities and significant inhibition against cytopathic effects induced by IAV (H1N1 and H3N2) replication in MDCK cells. Furthermore, cyclo(Ala-) and Bz-Phe-Phe-OMe significantly alleviated IAV-induced platelet activation and lung  in mice. They could reduce the expression of CD41 and the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT in PLTs of IAV-infected mice.These results suggested that cyclo(Ala-) and Bz-Phe-Phe-OMe isolated from MH have antiviral and anticoagulant effects against IAV-induced PLT aggregation and lung  via regulating CD41/PI3K/AKT pathway, and could be used as the potential agents for IAV treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, due to the acute thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia, long-term failure of synthetic grafts after implanted in small diameter blood vessel decelerates its commercial use. The continued acute  and delayed endothelialization have been considered as fundamental reasons. To enhance the adhesion and organization of endothelial cells (ECs) and improve the vascular remodeling process, we have constructed a vascular graft based on electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) matrix, on which organoselenium-immobilized polyethyleneimine (SePEI) for in situ nitric oxide (NO) generation and hyaluronic acid (HA) grafted with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) modified --Gly-Ser-Arg (YIGSR) for antifouling and EC adhesion were deposited through electrostatic layer-by-layer assembly. The in vitro results showed that SePEI deposited on the grafts could catalyze stable generation of NO. After in situ implantation in rats for 4 and 8weeks, the graft promoted the transformation of macrophages into an anti-inflammatory phenotype (M2), which helped endothelium remodeling. YIGSR on the outmost layer facilitated more rapid and organized EC adhesion compared to PCL and non-modified grafts. PEG polymer chain on the outmost layer mitigated nonspecific adsorption of undesirable blood components. In our study, we first demonstrated the regulation of macrophage polarization by an NO-generating vascular graft. The results indicated that the approach of anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization and enhanced endothelialization through NO generation and PEG-modified YIGSR in our study may provide a new perspective for the clinic application of cell-free small-diameter vascular grafts.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Ala, Gln, Gly, Lys, Val and taurine (Tau) are the most abundant free AAs in mammals, and some of these react with hypochlorite (HOCl/OCl) produced by myeloperoxidase in activated phagocytes to form N-chloroamino acids (NCAA). In this study, we reacted 20 AAs and Tau with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), then classified the products into five types (I-V) based on the change in their absorbance. Type I AAs (Ala, Arg, Gln, Gly, , Lys, Phe, Ser, Tau, Thr and Val) generated a typical monochloramine peak at 252 nm, while Type II AAs (Asn and ) and Type III AAs (Glu and Leu) produced peaks at 275 nm and 225 nm, respectively. The Type IV AAs (His, Met and Trp) did not show any distinct absorption peak, and Type V AAs (Asp, Cys and Pro) did not appear to react with NaOCl. The ArgCl and TauCl were stable, while GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, PheCl and ValCl were less stable and AlaCl, SerCl and ThrCl were the least stable. Tau is the most abundant non-proteinogenic free AA in cellular fluid and has many physiological functions in the nervous, cardiovascular, renal and immune systems. Tau reacts with HOCl to form TauCl, which inhibits the production of proinflammatory mediators such as superoxide, nitric oxide (NO) and interleukins, while increasing the antioxidant proteins in macrophages. We determined the effects of Type I NCAA on cell viability, NO and TNF-α production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells. All Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited LPS-induced NO production. However, only GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, SerCl and TauCl inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α production. In summary, Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited NO production, while their effects on TNF-α varied. Our results suggest that Type I NCAA may serve as biological regulators similar to TauCl during .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27106634>Metaflammasome components in the human brain: a role in dementia with Alzheimer's pathology?</a></h1><p>Epidemiological and genetic studies have identified metabolic disorders and inflammation as risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Evidence in  and type-2 diabetes suggests a role for a metabolic inflammasome ("metaflammasome") in mediating chronic inflammation in peripheral organs implicating IKKβ (inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta), IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate 1), JNK (c-jun N-terminal kinase), and PKR (double-stranded RNA protein kinase). We hypothesized that these proteins are expressed in the brain in response to metabolic risk factors in AD. Neocortex from 299 participants from the MRC Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies was analysed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of the phosphorylated (active) form of IKKβ [pSer ], IRS1 [pS ], JNK [pThr / ] and PKR [pT ]. The data were analyzed to investigate whether the proteins were expressed together and in relation with metabolic disorders, dementia, Alzheimer's pathology and APOE genotype. We observed a change from a positive to a negative association between the proteins and hypertension according to the dementia status. Type-2 diabetes was negatively related with the proteins among participants without dementia; whereas participants with dementia and AD pathology showed a positive association with JNK. A significant association between IKKβ and JNK in participants with dementia and AD pathology was observed, but not in those without dementia. Otherwise, weak to moderate associations were observed among the protein loads. The presence of dementia was significantly associated with JNK and negatively associated with IKKβ and IRS1. Cognitive scores showed a significant positive relationship with IKKβ and a negative with IRS1, JNK and PKR. The proteins were significantly associated with pathology in Alzheimer's participants with the relationship being inverse or not significant in participants without dementia. Expression of the proteins was not related to APOE genotype. These findings highlight a role for these proteins in AD pathophysiology but not necessarily as a complex.© 2016 The Authors.

Twenty-eight pigs were assigned to one of the two thermal conditions: thermoneutral (24 °C) or high ambient temperature (30 °C). The experimental period lasted 17 d, which was divided into a 7-d period without LPS (days -7 to -1), and a subsequent 10-d LPS period (days 1 to 10) in which pigs were administered 5 repeated injections of LPS at 2-d intervals. Postprandial profiles of plasma insulin and nutrients were evaluated through serial blood samples taken on days -4 (P0), 4 (P1), and 8 (P2). Before the LPS-challenge (P0), postprandial concentrations of glucose, lactate, Gln, , Leu, Phe, , and Val were greater in pigs kept at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). In contrast, Arg, Asp, Gly, His, and Met postprandial concentrations at P0 were lower at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). At both 24 and 30 °C conditions, pigs had greater postprandial concentrations of insulin (P < 0.01) and lower concentrations of NEFA (P < 0.01) and α-amino nitrogen (P < 0.05) at P1 and P2 than at P0. Compared with P0, postprandial concentrations of glucose were greater (P < 0.05) at P1 in pigs kept at 24 °C, and at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 30 °C. At both ambient temperatures, pigs had lower (P < 0.05) postprandial concentrations of Ala, Gly, His, , Leu, Pro, Ser, Thr, Trp, and Val at P1 and P2 than at P0. Arginine postprandial concentration at P1 was lower than at P0 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.05), whereas no difference was observed in pigs at 30 °C. Relative to P0, Gln and  concentrations were lower at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.01), whereas lower Gln concentration was observed only at P2 (P < 0.01) and lower  only at P1 (P < 0.01) in pigs kept at 30 °C. Our study shows a hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic state in LPS-challenged pigs and a greater magnitude of this response in pigs kept at 30 °C. Furthermore, LPS caused important changes in BCAA, His, Thr, and Trp profiles, suggesting the role these AA in supporting the inflammatory response. Finally, our results suggest that LPS-induced effects on postprandial profiles of specific AA (Arg, Gln, Phe, and ) may be modulated by ambient temperature.© The Author(s) 2019.
