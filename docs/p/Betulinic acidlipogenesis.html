<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28720829> is a PPARγ antagonist that improves glucose uptake, promotes osteogenesis and inhibits adipogenesis.</a></h1><p>PPAR antagonists are ligands that bind their receptor with high affinity without transactivation activity. Recently, they have been demonstrated to maintain insulin-sensitizing and antidiabetic properties, and they serve as an alternative treatment for metabolic diseases. In this work, an affinity-based bioassay was found to be effective for selecting PPAR ligands from the dried extract of an African plant (Diospyros bipindensis). Among the ligands, we identified  (BA), a compound already known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour and antidiabetic properties, as a PPARγ and PPARα antagonist. Cell differentiation assays showed that BA inhibits adipogenesis and promotes osteogenesis; either down-regulates or does not affect the expression of a series of adipogenic markers; and up-regulates the expression of osteogenic markers. Moreover, BA increases basal glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The crystal structure of the complex of BA with PPARγ sheds light, at the molecular level, on the mechanism by which BA antagonizes PPARγ, and indicates a unique binding mode of this antagonist type. The results of this study show that the natural compound BA could be an interesting and safe candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and bone diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31133421> lowers lipid accumulation in adipocytes through enhanced NCoA1-PPARγ interaction.</a></h1><p>Investigation for a naturally occurring anti-obesity drug has become the need of society all over the world.  (BA) is a lupane-type pentacyclic triterpene and is sourced from various organisms. This high potential biologically active molecule is reported to have anti-obesity effect. In this study, we report the molecular mechanism of action of BA that underlies anti-obesity activity and also an improved method of its isolation common teak tree.Mouse pre-adipocyte cells were used to develop hyperlipidemic conditions in vitro. Change in expression of genes associated to  was checked using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Co-factor specificity of PPAR gamma was analyzed through immune precipitation and immunoblot. was found to be effective in reducing the lipid content in 3T3L1 cells. Level of PPAR gamma and LXR alpha was reduced in connection to reduced . Change in steroid responsive co-activators (SRCs) during BA treatment proved that the compound can impart profound change in co-factor selectivity, which is crucial in determining the activity profile of PPAR gamma. BA treatment enhanced the SRC-1 interaction with PPAR gamma while reducing the levels of SRC-3.Present study has proved that , a promising candidate in anti-obesity drug development, has potential in regulating the activity of PPAR gamma through co-factor modulation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

(BA) is a naturally occurring triterpenoid that has anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesized that treatment with BA may result in decreased body weight gain, adiposity and hepatic steatosis in a diet-induced mouse model of obesity.Mice fed a high-fat diet and treated with BA showed less weight gain and tissue adiposity without any change in calorie intake. Gene expression profiling of mouse tissues and cell lines revealed that BA treatment increased expression of lipid oxidative genes and decreased that of lipogenesis-related genes. This modulation was mediated by increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, which facilitates energy expenditure, lipid oxidation and thermogenic capacity and exerts protective effects against obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Overall, BA markedly inhibited the development of obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice fed a high-fat diet, and AMPK activation in various tissues and enhanced thermogenesis are two possible mechanisms underlying the antiobesity and antisteatogenic effects of BA.The current findings suggest that treatment with BA is a potential dietary strategy for preventing obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.Copyright © 2018 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.
