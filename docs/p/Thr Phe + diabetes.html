In this report we examined the effects of streptozotocin-induced  on the feeding responses to centrally administered opioid agonists with differing receptor selectivities. The selective mu receptor agonist Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-(Me)-Gly-ol (DAGO) caused a larger increase in intake in diabetic rats than in controls. In both groups feeding responses were greater on the fourth day of daily injections than on the first day. The delta receptor agonist [D-Ser2,Leu5]-enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET) stimulated intake in controls but not in diabetics. However, the elevated baseline and large variability in intake of the diabetics in this experiment prevent drawing a conclusion on -induced changes in the potency of this peptide. No differences between controls and diabetics were apparent in the feeding responses to U50, 488H, a selective kappa receptor agonist. These data suggest that  may differentially affect the classes of opioid receptors or the binding of ligands to these receptors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509193>Effect of nicotinamide on amino acids content in bone collagen depending on biological availability of vitamins in diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Connective tissue is highly susceptible to imbalances induced by diabetes. Diabetes-related osteopenia, decreased bone strength etc. may be associated with altered metabolism of various collagens: Although it is assumed that alterations in collagen amino acids (AA) may strongly affect protein properties andphysiological functions, however, very limited evidences are present at the moment regarding AA composition of bone type I collagen and its relevance to abnormal availability of vitamins which are necessary for collagen synthesis in diabetes. We have tested whether nicotinamide (NAm) can influence type Icollagen formation and AA composition as well as vitamins availability in diabetes. After 4 weeks of STZ-induced diabetes (60 mg/ kg) male Wistar rats were injected for 2 weeks with/without NAm (200 mg/kg b. w). Acid extraction of type I collagen from the bones was performed with following stepwise salting out. The content of type I collagen after its acid extraction from the bones was estimated by the amounts of hydroxyproline. Amino acids were assayed by cation exchange chromatography Diabetes-associated changes in AA composition of type I collagen mainly affect those amino acids which are known to be involved in helix formation and cross-linking of the molecules. Diabetes was found to significantly reduce bone collagen contents of o-Pro, Gly, Ala, o-Lys and Pro, whereas Lys, His, Arg, Glu, , Leu,  contents were elevated (P < 0.05). NAm treatment was able to partially normalise AA contents. In diabetes, blood serum and hepatic vitamin C and B3 contents were shown to be significantly lowered, whereas a-tocopherol was slightly increased compared with control (P < 0.05). Restoration of circulatory and liver vitamin C and B3 was observed. The data demonstrate the close relationship between the diabetes-associated decrease in type I collagen deposition, altered amino acids metabolism and impaired availability of vitamins, which are necessary for collagen synthesis. Thus, NAm might be a useful agent for treatment of bone failures related to diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23019158>Structural determination of glycopeptidolipids of Mycobacterium smegmatis by high-resolution multiple-stage linear ion-trap mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization.</a></h2><p>Glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) are abundant in the cell walls of different species of mycobacteria and consist of tripeptide-amino-alcohol core of D--D-allo--D-Ala-L-alaninol linked to 3-hydroxy or 3-methoxy C(26-34) fatty acyl chain at the N-terminal of D- via amide linkage, and a 6-deoxytalose (6-dTal) and an O-methyl rhamnose residues, respectively, attach to D-allo- and the terminal L-alaninol. They are important cell-surface antigens that are implicated in the pathogenesis of opportunistic mycobacteria belonging to the Mycobacterium avium complex. In this contribution, we described multiple-stage linear ion trap in conjunction with high-resolution mass spectrometry towards structural characterization of complex GPLs as [M + Na](+) ions isolated from Mycobacterium smegmatis, a fast-growing and non-pathogenic mycobacterial species. Following resonance excitation in an ion trap, MS(n) spectra of the [M + Na](+) ions of GPLs contained mainly b and y series ions that readily determine the peptide sequence. Fragment ions from MS(n) also afford locating the 6-dTal and O-methyl rhamnose residues linked to the D-allo- and terminal L-alaninol of the peptide core, respectively, as well as recognizing the modifications of the glycosides, including their acetylation and methylation states and the presence of succinyl group. The GPL families consisting of 3-hydroxy fatty acyl and of 3-methoxy fatty acyl substituents are readily distinguishable. The MS profiles of the GPLs from cells are dependant on the conditions they were grown, and several isobaric isomers were identified for many of the molecular species. These multiple-stage mass spectrometric approaches give detailed structures of GPL in complex mixtures of which the isomeric structures are difficult to define using other analytical methods.Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30582909>The antihyperalgesic effect of docosahexaenoic acid in streptozotocin-induced neuropathic pain in the rat involves the opioidergic system.</a></h2><p>Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that has shown an antinociceptive effect in multiple pain models, such as inflammatory and neuropathic pain by chronic constriction injury in rats; however, its mechanism of action is still not well-understood. Reports suggest that DHA activates opioid signaling, but there is no information on this from a model of neuropathic pain. As a result, the aims of this study were (1) to determine the antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic effect of peripheral DHA administration, and (2) to evaluate the participation of the opioid receptors in the antihyperalgesic effect of DHA on streptozotocin-induced neuropathic pain in the rat. Female Wistar rats were injected with streptozotocin (50 mg/kg, i.p.) to induce hyperglycemia. The formalin, Hargreaves, and von Frey filaments tests were used to assess the nociceptive activity. Intraplantar administration of DHA (100-1000 μg/paw) or gabapentin (562-1778 μg/paw) decreased formalin-evoked hyperalgesia in diabetic rats, in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, DHA (562 μg/paw) and gabapentin (1000 μg/paw) reduced thermal hyperalgesia and allodynia. Local peripheral administration of naloxone (non-selective opioid receptor antagonist; 100 μg/paw), naltrindole (selective δ receptor antagonist; 1 μg/paw), and CTOP (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH2, μ receptor antagonist; 20 μg/paw) prevented formalin-evoked hyperalgesia in diabetic rats but not by GNTI (guanidinonaltrindole, κ receptor antagonist;1 µg/paw). It is suggested that peripheral DHA shows an antihyperalgesic effect in neuropathic pain in the rat. Furthermore, δ and μ receptors are involved in the antihyperalgesic peripheral effect of DHA in diabetic rats.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The peptide also stimulated insulin release from 1.1B4 human-derived clonal β-cells and isolated mouse islets and improved glucose tolerance concomitant with increased circulating insulin concentrations in mice following intraperitoneal administration. The insulinotropic activity of frenatin 2D was not associated with membrane depolarization or an increase in intracellular [Ca] but incubation of the peptide (1 μM) with BRIN-BD11 cells produced a modest, but significant (P < 0.05), increase in cAMP production. Stimulation of insulin release was abolished in protein kinase A-downregulated cells but maintained in protein kinase C-downregulated cells. Circular dichroism studies showed that, in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine micelles, frenatin 2D exhibited a helical content of 35% and a turn content of 28%. Substitution of the , Asn, Pro, and Ile residues in frenatin-2D by Trp and interchange of Pro and  led to loss of insulinotropic activity but the [D1W] and [G7W] analogues were as potent and effective as the native peptide. Frenatin 2D (1 μM) also stimulated proliferation of BRIN-BD11 cells and provided significant protection of the cells against cytokine-induced apoptosis. It is concluded that the insulinotropic activity of frenatin 2D is mediated predominantly, if not exclusively, by the K channel-independent pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

In this study, we have identified IRS-1 gene polymorphisms, evaluated their frequencies in Japanese subjects, and analysed the contribution of these polymorphisms to the development of NIDDM. The entire coding region of the IRS-1 gene of 94 subjects (47 NIDDM and 47 control subjects) was screened by polymerase chain reaction-single stranded conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. Seven SSCP polymorphisms were identified. These corresponded to two previously identified polymorphisms [Gly971 --> Arg (GGG --> AGG) and Ala804 (GCA --> GCG)] as well as five novel polymorphisms [Pro190 --> Arg (CCC --> CGC), Met209 -->  (ATG --> ACG), Ser809 -->  (TCT --> TTT), Leu142 (CTT --> CTC), and Gly625 (GGC --> GGT)]. Although the prevalence of each of these polymorphisms was not statistically different between NIDDM and control subjects, the prevalence of the four IRS-1 polymorphisms with an amino acid substitution together was significantly higher in NIDDM than in control subjects (23.4 vs 8.5%, p < 0.05), and two substitutions (Met 209 -->  and Ser809 --> ) were found only in NIDDM patients. Equilibrium glucose infusion rates during a euglycaemic clamp in NIDDM and control subjects with the IRS-1 polymorphisms decreased by 29.5 and 22.0%, respectively on the average when compared to those in comparable groups without polymorphisms, although they were not statistically significant. Thus, IRS-1 polymorphisms may contribute in part to the insulin resistance and development of NIDDM in Japanese subjects; however, they do not account for the major part of the decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake which is observed in subjects with clinically apparent NIDDM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11907155>Elucidation of vasoactive intestinal peptide pharmacophore for VPAC(1) receptors in human, rat, and guinea pig.</a></h2><p>Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neurotransmitter involved in a number of pathological and physiological processes. VIP is rapidly degraded and simplified stable analogs are needed. VIP's action was extensively studied in rat and guinea pig. However, it is largely unknown whether its pharmacophore in these species resembles human. To address this issue we investigated the VIP pharmacophore for VPAC(1) (the predominant receptor subtype in cancers and widely distributed in normal tissues) by using alanine and D-amino acid scanning. Interaction with rat, guinea pig, and human VPAC(1) was assessed using transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and PANC1 cells and cells possessing native VPAC(1). Important species differences existed in the VIP pharmacophore. The human VPAC(1) expressed in CHO cells, which were used almost exclusively in previous studies, differed markedly from the native VPAC(1) in T47D cells. The most important amino acids for determining affinity are His(1), Asp(3), (6), Arg(12), Arg(14), and Leu(23). Ser(2), Asp(8), Asn(9), (11), Val(19), Asn(24), Ser(25), Leu(27), and Asn(28) are not essential for high-affinity interaction/activation. [Ala(2,8,9,11,19,24,25,27,28)]VIP, which contained 11 alanines, was synthesized and it was equipotent to VIP at VPAC(1) receptors in all species and was metabolically stable. Our results show in any design of simplified VIP analogs for VPAC(1) it will be important to consider species differences and it is essential to use transfected systems that reflect the native receptor's pharmacophore. Last, with our results a simplified, metabolically stable VIP analog was identified that should be useful as a prototype for design of selective agonists/antagonists that could be useful therapeutically.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23097003>Interaction of dihydrofolate reductase and aminoglycoside adenyltransferase enzyme from Klebsiella pneumoniae multidrug resistant strain DF12SA with clindamycin: a molecular modelling and docking study.</a></h2><p>Klebsiella pneumoniae strain DF12SA (HQ114261) was isolated from diabetic foot wounds. The strain showed resistance against ampicillin, kanamycin, gentamicin, streptomycin, spectinomycin, trimethoprim, tetracycline, meropenem, amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, augmentin, co-trimoxazole, carbapenems, penicillins and cefoperazone, and was sensitive to clindamycin. Molecular characterization of the multidrug-resistance phenotype revealed the presence of a class 1 integron containing two genes, a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (PF00186), which confers resistance to trimethoprim; and aminoglycoside adenyltransferase (AadA) (PF01909), which confers resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin. A class 1 integron in K. pneumoniae containing these two genes was present in eight (18.18%) out of 44 different diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients. Hence, there is a need to develop therapeutics that inhibit growth of multidrug resistant K. pneumoniae in DFU patients and still achieve amputation control. Am attempt was made to create a 3D model and find a suitable inhibitor using an in silico study. Rational drug design/testing requires crystal structures for DHFR and AadA. However, the structures of DHFR and AadA from K. pneumoniae are not available. Modelling was performed using Swiss Model Server and Discovery Studio 3.1. The PDBSum server was used to check stereo chemical properties using Ramachandran plot analysis of modeled structures. Clindamycin was found to be suitable inhibitor of DHFR and AadA. A DockingServer based on Autodock & Mopac was used for docking calculations. The amino acid residues Ser(32), Ile(46), Glu(53), Gln(54), (57), (72), Met(76), Val(78), Leu(79), Ser(122), Tyr(128), Ile(151) in case of DHFR and (34), Asp(60), Arg(63), Gln(64), Leu(68), Glu(87), (89), Val(90) for AadA were found to be responsible for positioning clindamycin into the active site. The study identifies amino acid residues crucial to 'DHFR and AadA -drug' and 'DHFR and AadA -inhibitor' interactions that might be useful in the ongoing search for a versatile DHFR and AadA -inhibitor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20042596>Structural basis for the association of the redox-sensitive target of rapamycin FATC domain with membrane-mimetic micelles.</a></h2><p>The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a conserved eukaryotic Ser/ kinase that regulates cellular growth in response to the nutrient and energy state. TOR signaling plays an important role in the development of diseases such as cancer, obesity, and  and in different redox-sensitive processes (hypoxia, apoptosis, and aging). Because TOR has been detected at different cellular membranes and in the nucleus, its localization may influence the specific signaling readout. To better understand how TOR can associate with different membranes, the lipid-binding properties of the redox-sensitive yeast TOR1 FATC domain (y1fatc) have been characterized by solution NMR spectroscopy. Binding studies with different lipids indicate that y1fatc interacts specifically with a membrane-mimetic environment but appears not to recognize a specific lipid headgroup. In both, the structures of oxidized and reduced micelle-bound y1fatc, residues Ile-2456 to Trp-2470 of the lipid-binding motif form a hydrophobic bulb that has a rim of charged residues. The diffusion constants for both micelle-bound states are consistent with the rotational correlation times from the analysis of the (15)N relaxation data. Based on the K(d) values, the oxidized form (K(d) approximately 0.31 mm) binds dodecyl phosphocholine micelles slightly tighter than the reduced form (K(d) approximately 1.86 mM). Binding studies with y1fatc in which one or both tryptophans (Trp-2466 and Trp-2470) were replaced by alanine suggest that these residues are important for the exact positioning in the membrane and that the other aromatic (His-2462, Tyr-2463, and -2469) and aliphatic residues (Ile-2456, Leu-2459, Ile-2464, and Pro-2468) in the lipid-binding motif contribute significantly to the affinity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1909892>Secondary structure and side-chain 1H and 13C resonance assignments of calmodulin in solution by heteronuclear multidimensional NMR spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>Heteronuclear 2D and 3D NMR experiments were carried out on recombinant Drosophila calmodulin (CaM), a protein of 148 residues and with molecular mass of 16.7 kDa, that is uniformly labeled with 15N and 13C to a level of greater than 95%. Nearly complete 1H and 13C side-chain assignments for all amino acid residues are obtained by using the 3D HCCH-COSY and HCCH-TOCSY experiments that rely on large heteronuclear one-bond scalar couplings to transfer magnetization and establish through-bond connectivities. The secondary structure of this protein in solution has been elucidated by a qualitative interpretation of nuclear Overhauser effects, hydrogen exchange data, and 3JHNH alpha coupling constants. A clear correlation between the 13C alpha chemical shift and secondary structure is found. The secondary structure in the two globular domains of Drosophila CaM in solution is essentially identical with that of the X-ray crystal structure of mammalian CaM [Babu, Y., Bugg, C. E., & Cook, W.J. (1988) J. Mol. Biol. 204, 191-204], which consists of two pairs of a "helix-loop-helix" motif in each globular domain. The existence of a short antiparallel beta-sheet between the two loops in each domain has been confirmed. The eight alpha-helix segments identified from the NMR data are located at Glu-6 to -19, -29 to Ser-38, Glu-45 to Glu-54, -65 to Lys-77, Glu-82 to Asp-93, Ala-102 to Asn-111, Asp-118 to Glu-127, and Tyr-138 to -146. Although the crystal structure has a long "central helix" from -65 to -92 that connects the two globular domains, NMR data indicate that residues Asp-78 to Ser-81 of this central helix adopt a nonhelical conformation with considerable flexibility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1999271>Peptide-based radioimmunoassay specific for GLUT1 glucose transporter.</a></h2><p>A radioimmunoassay for the GLUT1 glucose transporter was developed with a synthesized peptide based on the sequence of the cDNA for GLUT1. A peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal domain of the GLUT1 glucose transporter (-Pro-Glu-Glu-Leu--His-Pro-Leu-Gly-Ala-Asp-Ser-Gln-Val) was synthesized and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through the NH2-terminal of the peptide. An antibody was raised against this complex and affinity purified with the immobilized peptide. A second peptide, with tyrosine residue added to the NH2-terminal of the above peptide, was synthesized and used as a standard and iodinated for preparation of the radioactive ligand. The assay is highly reproducible, sensitive, and specific for the COOH-terminal domain of the GLUT1 glucose transporter. It has no cross-reactivity with the other glucose-transporter isoforms GLUT2 and GLUT4. Furthermore, the results obtained with this radioimmunoassay on the number of glucose transporters in human erythrocytes were in good agreement with previous studies based on cytochalasin B binding, suggesting that this radioimmunoassay is able to quantify the number of glucose transporters. The assay is completed within 4 h and can be used for simultaneous measurement of GLUT1 in many samples. In addition, it can be applied to the measurement of GLUT1 in several types of tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24373935>Synthesis of new potent agonistic analogs of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and evaluation of their endocrine and cardiac activities.</a></h2><p>In view of the recent findings of stimulatory effects of GHRH analogs, JI-34, JI-36 and JI-38, on cardiomyocytes, pancreatic islets and wound healing, three series of new analogs of GHRH(1-29) have been synthesized and evaluated biologically in an endeavor to produce more potent compounds. "Agmatine analogs", MR-356 (N-Me-Tyr(1)-JI-38), MR-361(N-Me-Tyr(1), D-Ala(2)-JI-38) and MR-367(N-Me-Tyr(1), D-Ala(2), Asn(8)-JI-38), in which Dat in JI-38 is replaced by N-Me-Tyr(1), showed improved relative potencies on GH release upon subcutaneous administration in vivo and binding in vitro. Modification with N-Me-Tyr(1) and Arg(29)-NHCH3 as in MR-403 (N-Me-Tyr(1), D-Ala(2), Arg(29)-NHCH3-JI-38), MR-406 (N-Me-Tyr(1), Arg(29)-NHCH3-JI-38) and MR-409 (N-Me-Tyr(1), D-Ala(2), Asn(8), Arg(29)-NHCH3-JI-38), and MR-410 (N-Me-Tyr(1), D-Ala(2), (8), Arg(29)-NHCH3-JI-38) resulted in dramatically increased endocrine activities. These appear to be the most potent GHRH agonistic analogs so far developed. Analogs with Apa(30)-NH2 such as MR-326 (N-Me-Tyr(1), D-Ala(2), Arg(29), Apa(30)-NH2-JI-38), and with Gab(30)-NH2, as MR-502 (D-Ala(2), 5F-(6), Ser(28), Arg(29),Gab(30)-NH2-JI-38) also exhibited much higher potency than JI-38 upon i.v. administration. The relationship between the GH-releasing potency and the analog structure is discussed. Fourteen GHRH agonists with the highest endocrine potencies were subjected to cardiologic tests. MR-409 and MR-356 exhibited higher potency than JI-38 in activating myocardial repair in rats with induced myocardial infarction. As the previous class of analogs, exemplified by JI-38, had shown promising results in multiple fields including cardiology, diabetes and wound healing, our new, more potent, GHRH agonists should manifest additional efficacy for possible medical applications.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12388623>Elucidation of the vasoactive intestinal peptide pharmacophore for VPAC(2) receptors in human and rat and comparison to the pharmacophore for VPAC(1) receptors.</a></h2><p>Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) functions as a neurotransmitter involved in a number of physiological and pathological conditions. The actions of VIP are mediated through VPAC(1) and VPAC(2). In contrast to VPAC(1), which has been extensively studied, little is known about the pharmacology of VPAC(2). In this study we investigated the VIP pharmacophore for VPAC(2) by using alanine and D-amino acid scanning. We found significant species differences, and the human VPAC(2) (hVPAC(2)) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which have been used in previous studies, differed significantly from the native hVPAC(2) in Sup T(1) cells and hVPAC(2) expressed in PANC1 cells. There was a close agreement between binding affinities and potencies for VPAC(2) activation. The amino acids whose backbone or side chain orientations were most important for high affinity potency are Asp(3), (6), (7), Tyr(10), Arg(12), Tyr(22), and Leu(23), whereas the side chains of Ser(2), Asp(8), Asn(9), Gln(16), Val(19), Lys(20), Lys(21), Asn(24), and Ser(25) are not essential. Comparison of the VIP pharmacophore between hVPAC(1) and hVPAC(2) demonstrated that the side chains of (7), Tyr(10), (11), and Tyr(22) were much more critical for high affinity for the hVPAC(2) than the hVPAC(1). In contrast, the orientation of the side chain of Asn(24) was more important for high affinity for the hVPAC(1). This study shows that in assessing the pharmacophore of VIP analogs for the VPAC(2), important species differences need to be considered as well as the expression system used. These results of our study should be useful for designing VPAC subtype-selective analogs, simplified analogs, and possibly metabolically stable analogs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1347975>Actions of somatostatins on gastric smooth muscle cells.</a></h2><p>The effects of somatostatin-28, somatostatin-14, and a synthetic somatostatin octapeptide analogue, D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys--Cys-Nal-NH2 (cyclo SS-8) were examined on contraction of dispersed gastric smooth muscle cells from guinea pigs. The somatostatins did not cause contraction of gastric smooth muscle cells, nor did they inhibit carbachol-stimulated contraction. However, they reversed vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-induced inhibition (relaxation) of carbachol-stimulated contraction. Somatostatin-28 had a half-maximal effect (EC50) at 1.6 +/- 0.8 nM, cyclo SS-8 at 0.6 +/- 0.3 nM, but somatostatin-14 had no effect even when used in concentrations as high as 1 microM. Incubation of muscle cells with peptidase inhibitors phosphoramidon (1 microM) plus amastatin (10 microM) had no effect on the EC50 of somatostatin-28 or cyclo SS-8 but increased the potency of somatostatin-14 greater than 1,000-fold. When peptides were incubated with muscle cells and the products applied to high-performance liquid chromatography, cyclo SS-8 was not degraded, but somatostatin-14 was rapidly degraded when present alone, and the addition of peptidase inhibitors partially inhibited the degradation. Cyclo SS-8 had its maximal effect at 0.5-1 min and inhibited relaxation induced by VIP, isoproterenol, glucagon, or dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (DBcAMP). Cyclo SS-8 partially inhibited the increase in VIP-stimulated cAMP. Preincubation with pertussis toxin blocked the inhibitory action of cyclo SS-8 on VIP or DBcAMP-induced relaxation. These results indicate that gastric smooth muscle cells rapidly degrade somatostatin-14 and suggest that muscle cell peptidases could have a major effect on the actions of somatostatin-14.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28711271>Identification of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitory peptides from mare whey protein hydrolysates.</a></h2><p>Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) activity is a promising strategy for treatment of type 2 . In the current study, DPP-IV inhibitory peptides were identiﬁed from mare whey protein hydrolysates obtained by papain. The results showed that all the mare whey protein hydrolysates obtained at various hydrolysis durations possessed more potent DPP-IV inhibitory activity compared with intact whey protein. The 4-h hydrolysates showed the greatest DPP-IV inhibitory activity with half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.18 mg/mL.

There are no ligand binding studies, and it is unknown which of the five subtypes of SS receptors mediates the action. Dispersed gastric smooth muscle cells from guinea pig bound both 125I-labeled SS-14 and 125I-D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys--Cys-Nal-NH2 (where Nal indicates N-naphthylalanine) (cyclo-SS-8), a synthetic peptidase-resistant octapeptide SS analogue. SS-28 and SS-14, cyclo-SS-8, and SS analogue D--Cys--D-Trp-Lys--Cys--ol [SMS-(201-995) (octreotide)] inhibited 125I-cyclo-SS-8 binding with relative potencies of SS-28 = cyclo-SS-8 = SMS-(201-995) (octreotide), and the binding was not affected by the addition of protease inhibitors. SS-14 caused inhibition only in the presence of protease inhibitors. Ligand analysis demonstrated a two-binding-site model. Analysis of the relationship between biological function and binding suggested the high-affinity sites mediated the relaxant action of SS. 5'-Guanylylimidodiphosphate [Gpp-(NH)p] inhibited binding by reducing the affinity of the high-affinity site. Six SS-8 analogues that distinguish SS subtypes showed that 125I-SS-14 bound to somatostatin receptor subtype 3 (SSTR3). The results demonstrated that gastric smooth muscle cells possess distinct receptors for SS of the SSTR3 subtype. Occupation of these sites inhibits relaxation in gastric smooth muscle cells. Modulation between the high- and low- affinity binding states of SSTR3 is at least partially mediated by activation of guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25679092>Optimization and validation of a chiral GC-MS method for the determination of free D-amino acids ratio in human urine: application to a gestational diabetes mellitus study.</a></h2><p>Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy.

As D-AA elimination proceeds mainly by renal excretion, urine was the selected sample to evaluate the alterations in free D-AAs ratio in a GDM study. Only 1 mL of first void urine or standard solution was required for purification, by using a Discovery DSC-SCX SPE cartridge (500 mg/3 mL) and derivatization into their N(O)-pentafluoropropionyl amino acid 2-propyl esters. Enantiomeric separation was carried out by GC-MS on a Chirasil-L-Val N-propionyl-L-valine-tert-butylamide polysiloxane fused-silica capillary column (25 m×0.25 mm I.D., 0.12 μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany), under programmed temperature elution. Detection was performed with an ion trap mass analyzer, operating in the full scan mode in the m/z 50-350 range. 14 pairs of derivatives of D-and L-AAs were separated. The steps of sample preparation, derivatization and GC-MS conditions were optimized for both urine and standards. Several conditions affecting the SPE procedure, such as sorbent mass/volume ratio of the cartridge, sample dilution and pH, were optimized. Volume of reagents and solvents and reaction temperature and time were also tested for the derivatization. Regarding the GC-MS parameters, split ratio, temperature program and mass range were optimized. The final method was validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, accuracy and precision for D-Ala, D-Pro, D-Ser, D-Met, D-, D-Glu, D-Orn and D-Lys. Identification of AAs in urine samples was based on retention time and mass spectra. Urine from 20 women with GDM and 20 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (after 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test), matched according to the week of gestation and age (22-28 week of gestation and age 24-37 years), were enrolled into the study. %D-Relative amounts were determined for Ala, Val, , Ser, Leu, Asx (Asp+Asn), Glx (Glu+Gln), Met, , Tyr, Orn and Lys. Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were observed only for D- and higher values were found in the GDM group. It is possible that D- could be involved in metabolic/signaling pathways to compensate early stages of insulin resistance, although further work is necessary to confirm this hypothesis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TT-232 is a stable, peripherally acting heptapeptide (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Cys--NH2) somatostatin analogue with highest binding affinity for somatostatin sst4 receptors. It has been shown to inhibit acute and chronic inflammatory responses and sensory neuropeptide release from capsaicin-sensitive nociceptors. In the present study the antinociceptive effects of TT-232 were analysed using both acute and chronic models of nociception. Formalin-induced pain behaviour, noxious heat threshold and streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathic mechanical allodynia were examined in rats and phenylquinone-evoked abdominal constrictions were tested in mice. TT-232 (80 microg/kg i.p.) inhibited both early (0-5 min) and late phases (25-45 min) of formalin-induced nociception as revealed by determination of the composite pain score. The minimum effective dose to elevate the noxious heat threshold and diminish the heat threshold drop (heat allodynia) evoked by resiniferatoxin (0.05 nmol intraplantarly) was 20 and 10 microg/kg i.p., respectively, as measured by an increasing-temperature hot plate. TT-232 (10-200 microg/kg s.c.) significantly inhibited phenylquinone-evoked writhing movements in mice, but within this dose range no clear dose-response correlation was found. Five weeks after streptozotocin administration (50 mg/kg i.v.) the -induced decrease in the mechanonociceptive threshold was inhibited by 10-100 microg/kg i.p. TT-232. These findings show that TT-232 potently inhibits acute chemical somatic/visceral and thermal nociception and diminishes chronic mechanical allodynia associated with diabetic neuropathy, thereby it could open new perspectives in the treatment of various pain syndromes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21251827>A unique and rapid approach toward the efficient development of novel protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitors based on 'clicked' pseudo-glycopeptides.</a></h2><p>There has been considerable interest in the development of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitors since many of the PTP members are tightly associated with major human diseases including autoimmune disorders,  and cancer. We report here a unique and rapid approach toward the development of novel PTP inhibitor entities based on triazolyl pseudo-glycopeptides. By employing microwave-accelerated Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC or 'click reaction'), a series of triazole-linked serinyl, threoninyl, phenylalaninyl and tyrosinyl 1-O-gluco- or galactosides have been efficiently synthesized in high yields within only ~30 min. Successive biological assay identified these glycopeptidotriazoles as favorable PTP1B and CDC25B inhibitors with selectivity over TCPTP, LAR, SHP-1 and SHP-2. Both the structural diversity of the amino acid (Ser, ,  and Tyr) introduced and the epimeric identity (Glc or Gal) on monosaccharide scaffold were determined to impact the corresponding inhibitory activity and selectivity. In addition, the benzylated sugar scaffold was demonstrated to act as a crucial role for enhancing the binding affinity of the inhibitors with the targeted PTP. Docking simulation was eventually conducted to propose plausible binding modes of this compound series with PTP1B and CDC25B. Our approach readily realized from naturally abundant raw materials (sugar and amino acid) and via facile, regioselective and expeditious synthetic method (microwave-assisted click reaction) might provide new insights toward the 'click' fabrication of structurally diverse PTP inhibitors.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, in Swiss Webster mice, heroin has the unusual property of acting on brain delta opioid receptors whereas morphine still acts on mu receptors. The literature indicates that in diabetic mice and rats, the mu agonist potency of morphine is diminished while that to a delta receptor agonist is enhanced. The purpose of the present study was to determine if the response to heroin occurred through a delta receptor in the brain of streptozotocin-induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats. One week after a cannula was surgically implanted in the lateral ventricle,  was induced by intravenous administration of 55 mg/kg of streptozotocin. Three days later the receptor selectivity of intraventricular heroin in the tail flick test was determined by coadministration of opioid antagonists. In nondiabetic rats, a rightward shift in the dose response curve for heroin was produced by naloxone. D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen-ThrNH2, a more mu receptor selective antagonist given in a single dose experiment, also inhibited heroin action. Thus, heroin acted on mu receptors. In diabetic rats, intracerebroventricular naltrindole, but not naloxone nor CTOP, inhibited the heroin response and indicated a delta agonist action for heroin. Inhibition by intrathecal yohimbine of the mu (nondiabetic) and bicuculline of the delta response (diabetic) suggested spinal alpha2-adrenergic and GABA(A) receptor mediation, respectively, for the descending systems. In conclusion, the response to heroin was changed from mu in nondiabetic rats to a delta receptor action in diabetic rats. Understanding the basis for this change in receptor selectivity of heroin could provide an important avenue for investigating determinants of opioid receptor function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17884811>The A-chain of insulin contacts the insert domain of the insulin receptor. Photo-cross-linking and mutagenesis of a -related crevice.</a></h2><p>The contribution of the insulin A-chain to receptor binding is investigated by photo-cross-linking and nonstandard mutagenesis. Studies focus on the role of Val(A3), which projects within a crevice between the A- and B-chains. Engineered receptor alpha-subunits containing specific protease sites ("midi-receptors") are employed to map the site of photo-cross-linking by an analog containing a photoactivable A3 side chain (para-azido- (Pap)). The probe cross-links to a C-terminal peptide (residues 703-719 of the receptor A isoform, KTFEDYLHNVVFVPRPS) containing side chains critical for hormone binding (underlined); the corresponding segment of the holoreceptor was shown previously to cross-link to a Pap(B25)-insulin analog. Because Pap is larger than Val and so may protrude beyond the A3-associated crevice, we investigated analogs containing A3 substitutions comparable in size to Val as follows: , allo-, and alpha-aminobutyric acid (Aba). Substitutions were introduced within an engineered monomer. Whereas previous studies of smaller substitutions (Gly(A3) and Ser(A3)) encountered nonlocal conformational perturbations, NMR structures of the present analogs are similar to wild-type insulin; the variant side chains are accommodated within a native-like crevice with minimal distortion. Receptor binding activities of Aba(A3) and allo-(A3) analogs are reduced at least 10-fold; the activity of (A3)-DKP-insulin is reduced 5-fold. The hormone-receptor interface is presumably destabilized either by a packing defect (Aba(A3)) or by altered polarity (allo-(A3) and (A3)). Our results provide evidence that Val(A3), a site of mutation causing , contacts the insert domain-derived tail of the alpha-subunit in a hormone-receptor complex.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12803541>Gamma III-crystallin is the primary target of glycation in the bovine lens incubated under physiological conditions.</a></h2><p>Several mechanisms have been proposed for the way in which glucose and its metabolites cause cataract, retinopathy and other complications of , the most convincing being glycation. Glycation, the reaction of sugars with free amino groups of proteins, is one of a variety of non-enzymic post-translational modifications. The aim of the present study was to identify some of the most reactive proteins in the lens when incubated under physiological conditions. Fresh intact bovine lenses were incubated with [14C]glucose in a conventional tissue-culture medium with added antibiotics. After 3 and 6 days of incubation, the water-soluble proteins were separated by size-exclusion chromatography. Glycated proteins from the water-soluble fractions were separated by using a sugar affinity column (Affi-Gel 601). Then the radioactive fractions were identified on SDS/polyacrylamide gels. In addition, the whole bovine lenses were incubated with 10 mM fructose and glucose for 3 and 6 days. The glycated proteins from the water-soluble fractions in parallel with the radioactive fractions were separated by affinity chromatography, and were identified further by amino-acid sequencing. A progressive uptake of radioactive label showed that the majority of proteins incorporating both glucose and fructose were water-soluble fractions. Chromatography and SDS/polyacrylamide gel results showed that alpha- and gamma-crystallin and some proteins of a mean molecular mass of 36-37 kDa incorporated sugars early during incubation. After 6 days of incubation, more crystallins were glycated compared with 3 days, in particular beta-crystallin. Affinity-chromatography results indicated that proteins with subunit masses of 36 kDa and 20 kDa were possibly radiolabelled at an early stage. The purified glycated proteins following incubation with both glucose and fructose, which corresponded to 20 kDa and 36 kDa bands on SDS/polyacrylamide gels, were sequenced by Edman degradation. N-terminal sequences of both 20 kDa bands were Gly-Lys-Ile-, characteristic of gamma-crystallins, but the N-termini of both 36 kDa bands were blocked. Further sequencing after digestion of 36 kDa bands with trypsin and running on HPLC revealed that the glucose sample gave the peptide sequences as Gly-Glu-Tyr-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Gln-Gln and Tyr-Glu-Leu-Pro-Asn-Tyr-Arg, which match with bovine gammaIIIb-crystallin. The peptide sequence Tyr-Glu-Leu-Pro-Asn-Tyr-Arg is only present in the published sequence of bovine gammaIIIb-crystallin and not in any other type of gamma-crystallin. The fructose sample gave the peptide sequences Ile---Tyr-Glu-Asp-Arg, Arg-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Gln-Gln-Trp, Gln-Tyr-Leu-Leu-Arg and Val-Val-Asp-Leu-Tyr, which all matched with bovine gammaIIIa-crystallin. The sequence Val-Val-Asp-Leu-Tyr only appears in the sequence of bovine gammaIIIa-crystallin. gammaIII-Crystallin is the most susceptible lens protein to glycation. The primary target of glucose is gammaIIIb-crystallin, whereas that of fructose is gammaIIIa-crystallin. The early glycation of gammaIII-crystallin by glucose and fructose could result in structural alterations, leading to aggregation of crystallin and eventually cataract formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27980503>Stability of targeted metabolite profiles of urine samples under different storage conditions.</a></h2><p>Few studies have investigated the influence of storage conditions on urine samples and none of them used targeted mass spectrometry (MS).We investigated the stability of metabolite profiles in urine samples under different storage conditions using targeted metabolomics.Pooled, fasting urine samples were collected and stored at -80 °C (biobank standard), -20 °C (freezer), 4 °C (fridge), ~9 °C (cool pack), and ~20 °C (room temperature) for 0, 2, 8 and 24 h. Metabolite concentrations were quantified with MS using the AbsoluteIDQ™ p150 assay. We used the Welch-Satterthwaite-test to compare the concentrations of each metabolite. Mixed effects linear regression was used to assess the influence of the interaction of storage time and temperature.The concentrations of 63 investigated metabolites were stable at -20 and 4 °C for up to 24 h when compared to samples immediately stored at -80 °C. When stored at ~9 °C for 24 h, few amino acids (Arg, Val and Leu/Ile) significantly decreased by 40% in concentration ( < 7.9E-04); for an additional three metabolites (Ser, Met, Hexose H1) when stored at ~20 °C reduced up to 60% in concentrations. The concentrations of four more metabolites (Glu, , Pro, and ) were found to be significantly influenced when considering the interaction between exposure time and temperature.Our findings indicate that 78% of quantified metabolites were stable for all examined storage conditions. Particularly, some amino acid concentrations were sensitive to changes after prolonged storage at room temperature. Shipping or storing urine samples on cool packs or at room temperature for more than 8 h and multiple numbers of freeze and thaw cycles should be avoided.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25154780>Identification and characterisation of peptide binding motifs of six autoimmune disease-associated human leukocyte antigen-class I molecules including HLA-B*39:06.</a></h2><p>Research on CD8 T cell-mediated inflammatory diseases requires a better understanding of target epitopes and the constraints placed upon these by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I binding restrictions, especially those that relate to predisposing alleles. We used linear trap quadrupole fourier transform (LTQ-FT) tandem mass spectrometry to identify naturally processed and presented peptides eluted from the MHC-negative myeloid leukaemia cell line K562 transfected with specific MHC class I genes. We provide information on the peptidome of HLA-B*39:06, which is associated with the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes, and extend the analysis to include a further five human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles (HLA-A*02:01/-A*11:01/-A*24:02/-B*18:01/-B*38:01) studied under identical experimental conditions. We identified a total of 3095 individual peptides with a mascot score ≥40 (HLA-A*02:01 = 569 peptides, -A*11:01 = 904, A*24:02 = 257, -B*18:01 = 615, -B*38:01 = 453, -B*39:06 = 297). Peptides had a preferential length of nine amino acids and originated mainly from cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins. Eluted peptides revealed a strong binding motif with binding anchor positions at position 2 (P2) and the C-terminus (PΩ). Peptides eluted from HLA-A*02:01 showed a P2 preference for leucine (62% of total peptides have Leu at P2) and PΩ preference for valine (49%). Similar data are provided for HLA-A*11:01 (P2:, 29%; PΩ:Lys, 49%), -A*24:02 (P2:Tyr, 78%; PΩ:, 41%), -B*18:01 (P2:Glu, 77%; PΩ:Tyr, 32%), -B*38:01 (P2:His, 51%; PΩ:Leu, 45%) and -B*39:06 (P2:Arg/His, 24%; PΩ:Ala, 64%).

Due to its multiple beneficial effects, GLP-1 has gained great attention for treatment of type 2 diabetes and . However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction of GLP-1 with the heptahelical core domain of GLP1R conferring high affinity ligand binding and ligand-induced receptor activation. Here, using chimeric and point-mutated GLP1R, we determined that the evolutionarily conserved amino acid residue Arg(380) flanked by hydrophobic Leu(379) and (381) in extracellular loop 3 (ECL3) may have an interaction with Asp(9) and Gly(4) of the GLP-1 peptide. The molecular modeling study showed that Ile(196) at transmembrane helix 2, Met(233) at ECL1, and Asn(302) at ECL2 of GLP1R have contacts with His(1) and (7) of GLP-1. This study may shed light on the mechanism underlying high affinity interaction between the ligand and the binding pocket that is formed by these conserved residues in the GLP1R core domain.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11472212>Design and synthesis of potent and selective alpha(4)beta(7) integrin antagonists.</a></h2><p>Interactions of the integrins alpha(4)beta(7) with its cognate ligand mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) play a crucial role in the development of mucosa-associated lymphoid organs, in the generation of mucosal immune responses, and in diverse pathological processes such as chronic inflammatory bowel disease and type I . Using a previously developed spatial screening technique we describe the development of potent and selective alpha(4)beta(7) integrin antagonists based on the domain 1 Leu-Asp- (LDT) sequence of MAdCAM-1 that is essential for alpha(4)beta(7) integrin binding.

Previously, the weak binding of Ca/CaM to the human 12 AA cytosolic domain was studied using C-terminal anchored peptides. We now show the binding of N labeled -454 cytosolic domain peptides in solution or membrane anchored using NMR demonstrates a significant role for the lipid bilayer. Although binding is increased by the mutation Phe454Ala, this mutation was previously shown to abrogate actin binding. On the other hand, Ca/CaM binding is abrogated by phosphorylation of nearby -457, a post-translation modification required for actin binding and subsequent in vitro lumen formation. Binding of Ca/CaM to a membrane proximal peptide from the long 72 AA cytosolic domain anchored to lipid nanodiscs was very weak compared to lipid free conditions, suggesting membrane specific effects between the two isoforms. NMR analysis of N labeled Ca/CaM with unlabeled peptides showed the C-lobe of Ca/CaM is involved in peptide interactions, and hydrophobic residues such as Met-109, Val-142 and Met-144 play important roles in binding peptide. This information was incorporated into transmembrane models of CEACAM1 binding to Ca/CaM. The lack of Ca/CaM binding to phosphorylated -457, a residue we have previously shown to be phosphorylated by CaMK2D, also dependent on Ca/CaM, suggests stepwise binding of the cytosolic domain first to Ca/CaM and then to actin.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In 24 patients with hepatic encephalopathy stage III-IV (7 patients with acute and 17 with chronic liver failure) the PAG were evaluated. The determination of the plasma amino acids (PAA) was carried out on Multichrom B (Beckmann, Munich). In hepatic coma high concentrations of Met, Tyr, Ala, Lys and Arg are found.

In diabetic coma the three branches chain AA (Val, Leu and Ile) were elevated upon 3--5 times of normal. Near normal concentrations are found for the AA , Ser, Gly, Ala, Met and the aromatic AA ( and Tyr). The quotient between the branched chain and aromatic AA lies for hepatic coma at a mean of 1.18 and by diabetic coma at 7.18 (p less than 0.001). In hepatic coma a correlation exists between the level of the AA-quotient improvement and the decrease with a deterioriation of the metabolic encephalopathy.
