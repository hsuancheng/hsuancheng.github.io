DIETS AND MEASUREMENTS: Three groups of pigs (n = 12 per group) were fed for 8 days diets containing either omega-6 fatty acids (FAs) (corn oil; diet A), or omega-3 FAs (fish oil; diet B), or a combination of omega-6 and omega-3 FAs (borage and fish oils; diet C). Eight of 12 pigs in each group received a 0.1-mg/kg bolus of Escherichia coli endotoxin followed by a continuous infusion (0. 075 mg/kg/h). One lung was subsequently isolated ex vivo, and pressure-volume curves were measured. The contralateral lung was lavaged, and surfactant was analyzed for total and individual phospholipids and FA composition. Minimum and maximum surface tension was measured by bubble surfactometry.Pigs fed either diet B or C had increased  (C(18:1) omega-9), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA; C(20:5) omega-3), docosahexaenoic  (C(22:6) omega-3), and total omega-3 and monounsaturated FAs in their surfactant PUFA pools. The relative percentage of linoleic  (C(18:2) omega-6) and total omega-6 FAs were significantly lower from pigs fed diets B and C compared with diet A. Palmitic  (C(16:0)) concentrations, the primary FA in surfactant, had a tendency to be lower in pigs fed diets B and C. There were no demonstrable effects on surfactant function or pulmonary compliance.Diets containing EPA or EPA and gamma-linolenic  altered the PUFA composition of pulmonary surfactant, but without demonstrable effects on surfactant function during porcine .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3048767>Triacylglycerol output by the isolated perfused liver of endotoxin-treated rats.</a></h2><p>Liver perfusion experiments were performed to further investigate the origin of hypertriacylglycerolemia associated with  in rats. For this purpose male rats were treated with E. coli endotoxin in a dose of 0.5 mg/100 g b.w. intravenously, deprived of food (with free access to water), and used 18 h later for liver perfusion experiments. Livers were isolated and perfused for 4 h with a medium consisting of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing bovine serum albumin (4%, w/v), glucose, 5 mM, oleate, 0.7-0.8 mM, and aged human erythrocytes, 20% (v/v). The rates of triacylglycerol (TAG) output, oleate uptake, and ketogenesis were measured. Endotoxin treatment did not induce changes of the rate of either TAG output or ketogenesis in the perfused liver. The data give further support to the contention that hypertriacylglycerolemia associated with endotoxicosis is unlikely to originate in an overproduction of TAG by the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2407024>Effects of endotoxin infusion on circulating levels of eicosanoids, progesterone, cortisol, glucose and lactic , and abortion in pregnant cows.</a></h2><p>The effects of Escherichia coli endotoxin infusions (1.0 or 2.5 micrograms kg-1 over 6 h) on pregnancy were investigated in cows in the first, second and third trimester of gestation. Endotoxin increased the plasma levels of prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxane B2 and cortisol, and decreased progesterone. The severity of the clinical signs and the magnitude of the increases in plasma PGs, thromboxane B2 and cortisol tended to depend on the dose of endotoxin, but were independent of the gestation period. There was hyperglycemia followed by hypoglycemia and lactic acidemia. Hyperglycemia and lactic acidemia were significant only at the high dose of endotoxin. Endotoxin infusion at both doses caused a preferential mobilization of  from adipose tissue, and also had some effects on the mobilization of palmitic and stearic acids during the post-infusion period. The cows in the first trimester of gestation were more sensitive to the abortifacient effect of endotoxin than cows in the second and third trimester of gestation. The results of this study indicate that the mechanism of endotoxin-induced abortion in cows initially involves a prolonged release of PGF2 alpha and its subsequent stimulant effect on uterine smooth muscle contraction and luteolytic effect leading to a gradual decline in the plasma levels of progesterone. It was concluded that pregnancy terminates in the absence of an adequate level of progesterone, especially during the first trimester of gestation, when progesterone of extraluteal origin is not yet available, coupled with the PGF2 alpha-induced propulsive contraction of the uterus. In addition, the metabolic and circulatory failures in severe cases of , especially at the high dose of endotoxin, resulting either directly or indirectly via the release of various autacoids, catecholamines and cortisol, may also contribute to the termination of pregnancy at any stage of gestation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25421236>Effect of a high-fat meal containing conventional or high- peanuts on post-prandial lipopolysaccharide concentrations in overweight/obese men.</a></h2><p>An increased plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentration may favour metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance. The meal composition influences plasma LPS concentrations. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of the acute consumption of a high-fat meal (49% of energy from fat) containing conventional or high- peanuts on post-prandial LPS concentrations and its relationship with lipaemia and insulinaemia in overweight and obese men.The test meal consisted of a shake containing conventional peanuts (CVP; n = 21), high- peanuts (HOP; n = 23) or a control biscuit (CT; n = 21). Blood samples were collected in the fasting state and 1, 2 and 3 h post-prandially. LPS, insulin, lipids and glucose concentrations were assessed.LPS concentrations were lower in CVP [mean (SE) 0.7 (0.5) EU mL(-1) ] and HOP [1.0 (0.9) EU mL(-1) ] groups compared to CT [1.6 (1.2) EU mL(-1) ] at 3 h post-prandially. Triacylglycerol and insulin concentrations increased in all groups. Triacylglycerol started to increase only after 2 h in the CVP and HOP groups. LPS correlated positively with triacylglycerol. Insulin returned to basal concentrations at 3 h only in the CVP and HOP groups.The acute consumption of peanuts delayed the increase in serum triacylglycerol and favoured the quicker return of insulin to basal concentrations, especially in the CVP group. Our results suggest that the consumption of conventional or high- peanuts may help to reduce the risk of  and metabolic disorders.© 2014 The British Dietetic Association Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3825740>Potential therapeutic efficacy of inhibitors of human phospholipase A2 in septic shock.</a></h2><p>Soluble phospholipase A2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of local and systemic inflammatory reactions. Elevated levels of circulating phospholipase A2 (PLA2) correlate with the severity of circulatory collapse and pulmonary dysfunction in gram-negative septic shock. Characterization of septic shock serum PLA2 revealed a calcium-dependent enzyme with absolute 2-acyl specificity with a pH optimum of 7.5. We tested a number of therapeutic agents for their ability to inhibit PLA2 from human septic shock serum. Chloroquine, chlorpromazine, dexamethasone base, dexamethasone sodium phosphate, indomethacin, lidocaine, , palmitic , promethazine, trans-retinoic , rutin and dl-alpha-tocopherol were all studied over the range of 10(-2) to 10(-7) M. All agents, with the sole exception of dexamethasone base, inhibited PLA2 activity at concentrations greater than 10(-3) M. PLA2 inhibition by dexamethasone sodium phosphate was factitious, due to the formation of calcium-phosphate complexes. Of the 11 agents studied, chlorpromazine was the most effective, with an IC50 of 7.5 X 10(-5) M, a membrane concentration achievable within its therapeutic range. Inhibition was non-competitive with an apparent Ki of 5 nM. Since serum PLA2 levels correlate with mortality in both experimental  and clinical gram-negative septic shock, and chlorpromazine was previously shown to improve survival in these conditions, we postulate that its therapeutic efficacy resides at least in part in its PLA2-inhibitory activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2830707>Effects of smooth and rough Pasteurella haemolytica lipopolysaccharides on plasma cyclic-nucleotides and free fatty acids in calves.</a></h2><p>The present study examined the potency of smooth or rough Pasteurella haemolytica lipopolysaccharide infusion (LPS, 24 ng kg-1 min-1 for 500 min) on plasma cyclic-nucleotides and several free fatty acids (FFA) in calves. Both smooth or rough LPS increased plasma cAMP immediately to its maximum at 1 h of infusion, whereas plasma cGMP levels rose slowly and peaked 12 h later. The increases in cAMP levels were more prolonged for smooth LPS than rough LPS. The maximum plasma cAMP rise coincided with increases of several plasma FFA. Rough LPS increased plasma  greater than palmitic greater than stearic greater than linoleic acids in the second hour and reached their steady state levels between 2 h of infusion and 5 h post-infusion. Thereafter,  remained maximally elevated, while stearic  decreased and other FFA returned to baseline. Smooth LPS had no effects on palmitic and stearic acids, but elevated  in an essentially similar manner to rough LPS and increased linoleic  initially at 5 h, followed by decreases throughout post-infusion. These results demonstrate that  produces early marked elevations in plasma cAMP, a gradual rise in plasma cGMP and disproportionate increases in several plasma FFA. The data also demonstrate that smooth and rough LPS differ in their abilities to increase plasma cAMP and FFA and these may be attributed to differences in their in vivo mechanisms of action. The study suggests that cAMP and cGMP may mediate actions of endotoxin at the cellular level and that differences exist in release and/or utilization of each FFA at different stages of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27446914>In vitro Modulation of the LPS-Induced Proinflammatory Profile of Hepatocytes and Macrophages- Approaches for Intervention in Obesity?</a></h2><p>Low grade  is a feature of obesity which is linked to development of steatohepatitis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In this study, macrophages (J774) and hepatocytes (HepG2) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E. coli 0111: B4 and analyzed for modulation of this response when preconditioned or stimulated subsequent to LPS, with different doses of Vitamin D3 or docosahexaenoic  (DHA) over a time period of 1 and 5 days. Pro-inflammatory TNFα and pro-fibrotic TGFβ released into the supernatants were measured by ELISA; qPCR was performed for Srebp-1c and PPARα mRNA (genes for products involved in fatty  synthesis and catabolism, respectively). Vitamin D3 and DHA exerted a consistent, dose dependent anti-inflammatory effect, and increased PPARα relative to Srebp-1c in both cell types. By contrast, addition of free fatty acids (FFA, /palmitic  2:1) caused aggravation of LPS-induced inflammatory reaction and an increase of Srebp-1c relative to PPARα. Our results argue in favor of dietary supplementation of Vitamin D3 or DHA (and avoidance of monounsaturated/saturated fatty acids) to alleviate development of fatty liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12438765>Utilisation of fatty  and triacylglycerol by rat macrophages: the effect of endotoxin.</a></h2><p>Plasma very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) concentrations are increased during sepsis/ and VLDL may be substrates for the activated immune system. Lipid substrate utilisation by quiescent and activated macrophages was therefore examined.Rat R2 macrophages were incubated with oleate or rat VLDL, with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. The metabolic fate of the lipids was examined.Macrophages utilised both oleate and (control) VLDL-triacylglycerol (TAG) to a similar extent. Most was deposited as cellular lipid; about 10% of oleate was oxidised compared to 25% of cVLDL-TAG. LPS significantly increased oleate oxidation and its deposition as cellular lipid (mostly as TAG) at 48hrs but abolished both oxidation and storage of VLDL-TAG. VLDL produced during  (eVLDL) was assimilated by the unstimulated macrophage to a greater extent than oleate or cVLDL-TAG and selectively stored as cellular lipids (no oxidation); LPS decreased eVLDL utilisation. VLDL-TAG utilisation was decreased by the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) inhibitor terahydrolipstatin. LPL activity was greater in oleate than in VLDL incubations, but was increased by incubation with eVLDL. LPS had no effect (oleate, cVLDL) or increased (eVLDL) LPL activity.VLDL represented an efficient substrate for the macrophage. However under conditions of sepsis/ eVLDL utilisation was limited and directed away from oxidation, suggesting that the increased plasma TAG (eVLDL) concentrations resulting from sepsis is not a respiratory fuel for the macrophage but may supply cellular lipid.Copyright 2002 S.

However, the fate of triglycerides after acute renal insults is poorly defined. This study sought new insights into this issue.CD-1 mice were subjected to three diverse models of renal stress: (1)  [Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), injection]; (2) ischemia/reperfusion (I/R); or (3) glycerol-induced rhabdomyolysis. Renal cortical, or isolated proximal tubule, triglyceride levels were measured approximately 18 hours later. To gain mechanistic insights, triglyceride levels were determined in (1) proximal tubules following exogenous phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) treatment; (2) cultured HK-2 cells after mitochondrial blockade (antimycin A) +/- serum; or (3) HK-2 cells following "septic" (post-LPS) serum, or exogenous fatty  (oleate) addition.Each form of in vivo injury evoked three-to fourfold triglyceride increases in renal cortex and/or proximal tubules. PLA(2) treatment of proximal tubules evoked acute, dose-dependent, triglyceride formation. HK-2 cell triglyceride levels rose with antimycin A. With serum present, antimycin A induced an exaggerated triglyceride loading state (vs. serum alone or antimycin A alone). "Septic" serum stimulated HK-2 triglyceride formation (compared to control serum). Oleate addition caused striking HK-2 cell triglyceride accumulation. Following oleate washout, HK-2 cells were sensitized to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion or oxidant attack.Diverse forms of renal injury induce dramatic triglyceride loading in proximal tubules/renal cortex, suggesting that this is a component of a cell stress response. PLA(2) activity, increased triglyceride/triglyceride substrate (e.g., fatty ) uptake, and possible systemic cytokine (e.g., from LPS) stimulation, may each contribute to this result. Finally, in addition to being a marker of prior cell injury, accumulation of triglyceride (or of its constituent fatty acids) may predispose tubules to superimposed ATP depletion or oxidant attack.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20032118>Nitro- protects against endotoxin-induced  and multiorgan injury in mice.</a></h2><p>Nitroalkene derivatives of nitro- (OA-NO2) are endogenous lipid products with potent anti-inflammatory properties in vitro. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the in vivo anti-inflammatory effect of OA-NO2 in mice given LPS. Two days before LPS administration, C57BL/6J mice were chronically infused with vehicle (LPS vehicle) or OA-NO2 (LPS OA-NO2) at 200 microg x kg(-1) x day(-1) via osmotic minipumps; LPS was administered via a single intraperitoneal (ip) injection (10 mg/kg in saline). A third group received an ip injection of saline without LPS or OA-NO2 and served as controls. At 18 h of LPS administration, LPS vehicle mice displayed multiorgan dysfunction as evidenced by elevated plasma urea and creatinine (kidney), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT; liver), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reduced ejection fraction (heart). In contrast, the severity of multiorgan dysfunction was less in LPS OA-NO2 animals. The levels of circulating TNF-alpha and renal TNF-alpha mRNA expression, together with renal mRNA expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1, and with renal mRNA and protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase 2, and renal cGMP and PGE2 contents, were greater in LPS vehicle vs. control mice, but were attenuated in LPS OA-NO2 animals. Similar patterns of changes in the expression of inflammatory mediators were observed in the liver. Together, pretreatment with OA-NO2 ameliorated the inflammatory response and multiorgan injury in endotoxin-induced  in mice.</p></html>
