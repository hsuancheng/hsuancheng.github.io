The present study investigated the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) system using organoids. Organoids from murine small intestinal and colonic crypts were successfully cultured. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that small intestinal and colonic organoids express mRNAs encoding tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (TPH1) (the rate-limiting enzyme of 5-HT synthesis), serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT), 5-HT receptor (HTR)2A, HTR2B, and HTR4. SERT mRNA levels were significantly higher in the small intestine than in the colon in both the mucosal tissues and organoids, as estimated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Although the 5-HT concentration and levels of chromogranin A (CgA) (an enteroendocrine cell marker), TPH1, and HTR4 mRNAs were significantly higher in the colonic mucosa than the small intestinal mucosa, they were the same in small intestinal and colonic organoids. There were no significant differences in HTR2A and HTR2B mRNA levels between the small intestine and colon in either the mucosal tissues or organoids. Immunofluorescence staining showed that the number of CgA-positive cells in the colonic organoids appeared to increase upon culturing with .  supplementation significantly increased CgA, TPH1, and HTR4 mRNA levels in the colonic organoids. We propose that organoids are useful for investigating the 5-HT system in the intestinal , even though colonic organoids may require  microbiota-derived factors such as short-chain fatty acids.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Recent scientific studies suggest that energy intake (EI) perturbations at the population level cannot account for the current obesity epidemic, and significant work is investigating the potential role of the microbiome, and in particular its metabolic products, notably SCFA, predominantly , propionate and butyrate, the last of which is an energy source for the  of the large intestine. The energy yield from dietary residues may be a significant factor influencing energy balance. This review posits that the contribution towards EI is governed by EI diet composition (not just fibre), the composition of the microbiome and by the levels of physical activity. Furthermore, we hypothesise that these factors do not exist in a steady state, but rather are dynamic, with both short- and medium-term effects on appetite regulation. We suggest that the existing modelling strategies for bacterial dynamics, specifically for growth in chemostat culture, are of utility in understanding the dynamic interplay of diet, activity and microbiomic organisation. Such approaches may be informative in optimising the application of dietary and microbial therapy to promote health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31213556>Bifidobacterium dentium Fortifies the Intestinal Mucus Layer via Autophagy and Calcium Signaling Pathways.</a></h2><p>Much remains unknown about how the intestinal microbiome interfaces with the protective intestinal mucus layer.  species colonize the intestinal mucus layer and can modulate mucus production by goblet cells.

Microbe-host interactions in the intestine occur along the mucus-covered . In the gastrointestinal tract, mucus is composed of glycan-covered proteins, or mucins, which are secreted by goblet cells to form a protective gel-like structure above the . Low levels of mucin or alterations in mucin glycans are associated with inflammation and colitis in mice and humans. Although current literature links microbes to the modulation of goblet cells and mucins, the molecular pathways involved are not yet fully understood. Using a combination of gnotobiotic mice and mucus-secreting cell lines, we have identified a human-derived microbe, , which adheres to intestinal mucus and secretes metabolites that upregulate the major mucin MUC2 and modulate goblet cell function. Unlike other  species,  does not extensively degrade mucin glycans and cannot grow on mucin alone.

Our recent data suggest Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (Lp299v) supplementation reduces infarct size in male rats. Limited human data are available on the impact of Lp299v on the vasculature.To determine whether oral Lp299v supplementation improves vascular endothelial function and reduces systemic inflammation in humans with stable coronary artery disease (CAD).Twenty men with stable CAD consumed a drink containing Lp299v (20 billion CFU) once daily for 6 weeks. After a 4-week washout, subjects were given an option of additionally participating in a 10-day study of oral liquid vancomycin (250 mg QID). Vascular endothelial function was measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation. Before and after Lp299v, plasma short-chain fatty acids, trimethylamine oxide, and adipokine levels were measured. Additional plasma samples underwent unbiased metabolomic analyses using liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy. 16S rRNA sequencing was used to determine changes of the stool microbiome. Arterioles from patients with CAD were obtained, and endothelium-dependent vasodilation was measured by video microscopy after intraluminal incubation with plasma from Lp299v study subjects. Lp299v supplementation improved brachial flow-mediated dilation ( P=0.008) without significant changes in plasma cholesterol profiles, fasting glucose, or body mass index. Vancomycin did not impact flow-mediated dilation. Lp299v supplementation decreased circulating levels of IL (interleukin)-8 ( P=0.01), IL-12 ( P=0.02), and leptin ( P=0.0007) but did not significantly change plasma trimethylamine oxide concentrations ( P=0.27). Plasma propionate ( P=0.004) increased, whereas  levels decreased ( P=0.03). Post-Lp299v plasma improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation in resistance arteries from patients with CAD ( P=0.02).16S rRNA analysis showed the Lactobacillus genus was enriched in postprobiotic stool samples without other changes.Lp299v improved vascular endothelial function and decreased systemic inflammation in men with CAD, independent of changes in traditional risk factors and trimethylamine oxide. Circulating -derived metabolites likely account for these improvements and merit further study.URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

SCFA (formate, , propionate, butyrate) are formed by the anaerobic carbohydrates fermentation and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA), such as isobutyric and isovaleric acids, are derived from amino acids valine and leucine. Phenylcarboxylic acids (PCA), such as phenylacetic acid (PAA), phenyipropionic acid (PPA), phenyllactic acid (PLA) and some other acids, are metabolites of amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine involved in host adaptation and regulation. ma unique experiment, the authors first examined effect of the carboxylic acids on host cell proliferation in organotypic tissue cultures (rat spleen explants). The study showed that almost all biogenic aliphatic carboxylic acids have a positive effect on cell proliferation in rat spleen tissue. This fundamentally distinguishes them from amino acids, many of which have an inhibitory effect at the same concentrations. These findings suggest that SCFA, including hydrox~ and oxo derivatives, can act as positive regulators of host immune tissues. Some SCFA (for example, butyric acid), stimulate proliferation of normal host cells (immune tissue, intestinal ), but inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells ('butyrate paradox'). Unlike SCFA, phenylcarboxylic acids have a negative effect on host immune tissues explants and induce apoptosis. These data confirm the potential contribution of phenylcarboxylic acids in the pathogenesis of chronic disorders associated with impaired immune response, including autoimmune diseases. The authors suggest that PCA may serve as early metabolic markers of sepsis, immune-related diseases and chronic inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (iBD), colorectal cancer, chronic kidney disease and liver, secondary imrnunodeficiency. It can be assumed that carboxylic acids are evolutionary precursors of amino acids that have a wide variety of functions and able to modulate not only proliferation but also apoptosis. The results agree well with the data obtained in the study of Actoflor-C (microbial metabolites complex) and can be used to study mechanisms of action of probiotic strains and metabiotics (e.g. butyrate and propionate-containing formulations), as well as for the development of innovative medicines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30026849>Effects of the intestinal microbial metabolite butyrate on the development of colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the major health threats in developed countries. Changes in dietary components, such as more protein and lipid intake, can increase the risk of CRC. Diet affects CRC in many ways. They regulate the composition and function of  microbiota, which have an amazing metabolic capacity and can produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as propionate, , and butyrate. Butyrate is a principal energy source for colonic epithelial cells and plays an important role in maintaining the stability of  microbiota and the integrity of intestinal . However, there are few studies reviewing the anti-CRC potentials of butyrate. This review summarizes the recent research progresses in the effect of  microbiota imbalance and the decrease in intestinal microbial metabolite butyrate caused by unbalanced diet on CRC development, and discusses the mechanisms of butyrate-induced anti-CRC activities, which may guide people to prevent CRC by improving diet structures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27664183>Microbial short chain fatty acid metabolites lower blood pressure via endothelial G protein-coupled receptor 41.</a></h2><p>Short chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolites are byproducts of  microbial metabolism that are known to affect host physiology via host G protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs). We previously showed that an acute SCFA bolus decreases blood pressure (BP) in anesthetized mice, an effect mediated primarily via Gpr41. In this study, our aims were to identify the cellular localization of Gpr41 and to determine its role in BP regulation. We localized Gpr41 to the vascular endothelium using RT-PCR: Gpr41 is detected in intact vessels (with endothelium) but is absent from denuded vessels (without endothelium). Furthermore, using pressure myography we confirmed that SCFAs dilate resistance vessels in an endothelium-dependent manner. Since we previously found that Gpr41 mediates a hypotensive response to acute SCFA administration, we hypothesized that Gpr41 knockout (KO) mice would be hypertensive. Here, we report that Gpr41 KO mice have isolated systolic hypertension compared with wild-type (WT) mice; diastolic BP was not different between WT and KO. Older Gpr41 KO mice also exhibited elevated pulse wave velocity, consistent with a phenotype of systolic hypertension; however, there was no increase in ex vivo aorta stiffness (measured by mechanical tensile testing). Plasma renin concentrations were also similar in KO and WT mice. The systolic hypertension in Gpr41 KO is not salt sensitive, as it is not significantly altered on either a high- or low-salt diet. In sum, these studies suggest that endothelial Gpr41 lowers baseline BP, likely by decreasing active vascular tone without altering passive characteristics of the blood vessels, and that Gpr41 KO mice have hypertension of a vascular origin.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26606879>Fermentation of bioactive solid lipid nanoparticles by human  microflora.</a></h2><p>Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) can be used for oral delivery of phenolic compounds in order to protect them from the harsh conditions of digestion and improve their bioavailability in the intestinal . Recently, the production and characterization of SLNs loaded with rosmarinic acid (RA) and herbal extracts was performed for future use as functional food ingredients. Diet components have been shown to have a huge impact on  microbiota viability and metabolic activity. Hence, SLNs loaded with RA, sage and savoury extracts have been evaluated for their effect on intestinal microbiota growth and the metabolic products generated. Fermentations in anaerobic batch cultures using volunteer human faeces were performed during 24 h. Dynamic bacterial population changes were analysed using PCR-real time, as well as the generation of fatty acids and the quantification of phenolic compounds by analytical methods.

Previous studies have shown that starter feeding can effectively facilitate the growth and development of the rumen in ruminants. However, the mechanism through which starter feeding stimulates the development of the rumen is not clear. Here, we performed an integrated analysis in ruminal microbiota and a host transcriptomic profile in a lamb model with the intervention of starter feed to understand the ruminal microbiome-host crosstalk in stimulating the development of the ruminal .Decreased ruminal pH and increased  and butyrate concentrations in the rumen, followed by increasing rumen organ index, were observed in lambs supplemented with starter. Using metagenome sequencing in combination with 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, the results showed the abundance of -producing Mitsuokella spp., lactate-producing Sharpea spp., lactate-utilizing Megasphaera spp., and Entodinium spp. was enriched in rumen microbial communities in the starter-feed group. The abundances of genes involved in sugar degradation were decreased in starter-feed lambs, but the GH13 encoding α-amylase was obviously increased. Rumen epithelial transcriptome analysis revealed that seven differentially expressed genes, including MAPK1, PIK3CB, TNFSF10, ITGA6, SNAI2, SAV1, and DLG, related to the cell growth module were upregulated, and BAD's promotion of cell death was downregulated. Correlation analysis revealed that the increase in the concentrations of  and butyrate significantly correlated with the expression of these genes, which indicates  and butyrate likely acted as important drivers in the ruminal microbiome-host crosstalk.The present study comprehensively describes the symbiotic relationship between the rumen microbiota and the host in lambs after starter feeding. Our data demonstrates that the microbiome-driven generation of  and butyrate mediated the growth-related genes' regulation of the growth-associated signalling pathway in the ruminal . These co-development networks regulated many physiological processes in the , including papillae morphology and rumen epithelial growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25459886>High-protein diet differently modifies intestinal goblet cell characteristics and mucosal cytokine expression in ileum and colon.</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that high-protein (HP) diet ingestion causes marked changes in the luminal environment of the colonic . This study aimed to evaluate the impact of such modifications on small intestinal and colonic mucosa, two segments with different transit time and physiological functions. Rats were fed with either normal protein (NP; 14% protein) or HP (53% protein) isocaloric diet for 2 weeks, and parameters related to intestinal mucous-secreting cells and to several innate/adaptive immune characteristics (myeloperoxidase activity, cytokine and epithelial TLR expression, proportion of immune cells in -associated lymphoid tissues) were measured in the ileum and colon. In ileum from HP animals, we observed hyperplasia of mucus-producing cells concomitant with an increased expression of Muc2 at both gene and protein levels, reduction of mucosal myeloperoxidase activity, down-regulation of Tlr4 gene expression in enterocytes and down-regulation of mucosal Th cytokines associated with CD4+ lymphocyte reduction in mesenteric lymph nodes. These changes coincided with an increased amount of  in the ileal luminal content. In colon, HP diet ingestion resulted in a lower number of goblet cells at the epithelial surface but increased goblet cell number in colonic crypts together with an increased Muc3 and a slight reduction of Il-6 gene expression. Our data suggest that HP diet modifies the goblet cell distribution in colon and, in ileum, increases goblet cell activity and decreases parameters related to basal  inflammatory status. The impact of HP diet on intestinal mucosa in terms of beneficial or deleterious effects is discussed.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We have tested the hypothesis that long-term exposure to physiological concentrations of SCFA can affect the transport and metabolism of (poly)phenols by the intestinal  using the Caco-2 cell model. Metabolites and conjugates of hesperetin (HT) and ferulic acid (FA), -derived from dietary hesperidin and chlorogenic acid, respectively, were quantified by LC-MS with authentic standards following transport across differentiated cell monolayers. Changes in metabolite levels were correlated with effects on mRNA and protein expression of key enzymes and transporters. Propionate and butyrate increased both FA transport and rate of appearance of FA glucuronide apically and basolaterally, linked to an induction of MCT1. Propionate was the only SCFA that augmented the rate of formation of basolateral FA sulfate conjugates, possibly via basolateral transporter up-regulation. In addition, propionate enhanced the formation of HT glucuronide conjugates and increased HT sulfate efflux toward the basolateral compartment.  treatment amplified transepithelial transport of FA in the apical to basolateral direction, associated with lower levels of MCT1 protein expression. Metabolism and transport of both HT and FA were curtailed by the organic acid lactate owing to a reduction of UGT1A1 protein levels. Our data indicate a direct interaction between microbiota-derived metabolites of (poly)phenols and SCFA through modulation of transporters and conjugating enzymes and increase our understanding of how dietary fiber, via the microbiome, may affect and enhance uptake of bioactive molecules.Copyright Â© 2016 The Authors.

These milk replacers (MR) should accelerate the rumen development, determining early solid feed intake and leading to better performances in cattle. Previous research demonstrated that sodium butyrate supplementation in MR can affect both small intestine and rumen development. Also  and propionate showed similar properties, while only a few studies indicate some potential benefit of monoglycerides on  functions. The present study is aimed to determine the effect of the supplementation of a blend containing short and medium chain fatty acids monoglycerides (SMCFA) in milk replacer on rumen papillae development and growth performances in weaning calves. Twenty bull calves (about 2 weeks old, weighing around 43kg) were randomly allocated into two groups: control (C) and treated (T). Besides MR and starter diet, the latter offered at libitum, T calves received 0.2% SMCFA in MR. Animals were slaughtered after 56 days from the beginning of the trial. No difference was found between groups either in growth performances or in mean number of papillae/cm(2) of mucosa, total surface of papillae (mm(2))/cm(2) of mucosa or papillary size. In both groups, the morphology of the rumen  was typical of parakeratosis. The cells of the stratum spinosum were directly transformed into swollen, ovoid, still nucleated keratinocytes, particularly at the papillary tip, probably as a result of unphysiological osmolarities caused by high concentrate intake. Degenerated squamous horn cells covered the "balloon like" cells forming several layers, particularly in the places of the rumen mucosa more protected from an abrasive action of solid feed. This was more evident in C animals. The squamous cells covering the papillary tip showed cytoplasmic protrusion, representing remains of the attachment sites of desmosomes, which increased the total absorptive surface and were more numerous and higher in T compared to C animals. It might be hypothesized that SMCFA supplementation in MR could better regulate epithelial cell proliferation and probably have an "emollient effect" leading to an easier "peeling" that might increase efficiency for nutrient transport across the .Copyright © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

They are linked with multiple beneficial effects on the general mammalian health, based on the sophisticated interplay with the host immune response. Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV1) is a major pathogen, which primarily replicates in the respiratory , and disseminates through the body via a cell-associated viremia in leukocytes, even in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Infected monocytic CD172a cells and T-lymphocytes transmit EHV1 to the endothelium of the endometrium or central nervous system (CNS), causing reproductive or neurological disorders. Here, we questioned whether SCFA have a potential role in shaping the pathogenesis of EHV1 during the primary replication in the URT, during the cell-associated viremia, or at the level of the endothelium of the pregnant uterus and/or CNS. First, we demonstrated the expression of SCFA receptors, FFA2 and FFA3, within the  of the equine respiratory tract, at the cell surface of immune cells, and equine endothelium. Subsequently, EHV1 replication was evaluated in the URT, in the presence or absence of SB, SPr, or SAc. In general, we demonstrated that SCFA do not affect the number of viral plaques or virus titer upon primary viral replication. Only SB and SPr were able to reduce the plaque latitudes. Similarly, pretreatment of monocytic CD172a cells and T-lymphocytes with different concentrations of SCFA did not alter the number of infected cells. When endothelial cells were treated with SB, SPr, or SAc, prior to the co-cultivation with EHV1-inoculated mononuclear cells, we observed a reduced number of adherent immune cells to the target endothelium. This was associated with a downregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in the presence of SCFA, which ultimately lead to a significant reduction of the EHV1 endothelial plaques. These results indicate that physiological concentrations of SCFA may affect the pathogenesis of EHV1, mainly at the target endothelium, in favor of the fitness of the horse. Our findings may have significant implications to develop innovative therapies, to prevent the devastating clinical outcome of EHV1 infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27824274>In vitro colonisation of the distal colon by Akkermansia muciniphila is largely mucin and pH dependent.</a></h2><p>Host mucin is the main constituent of the mucus layer that covers the   of the host, and an important source of glycans for the bacteria colonising the intestine. Akkermansia muciniphila is a mucin-degrading bacterium, abundant in the human , that is able to produce  and propionate during this degradation process. A. muciniphila has been correlated with human health in previous studies, but a mechanistic explanation is lacking. In this study, the main site of colonisation was characterised alongside additional conditions, such as differences in colon pH, prebiotic supplementation and variable mucin supply. To overcome the limitations of in vivo studies concerning variations in mucin availability and difficult access to proximal regions of the colon, a dynamic in vitro  model (SHIME) was used. In this model, A. muciniphila was found to colonise the distal colon compartment more abundantly than the proximal colon ((±8 log copies/ml compared to ±4 log copies/ml) and the preference for the distal compartment was found to be pH-dependent. The addition of mucin caused a specific increase of A. muciniphila (±4.5 log increase over two days), far exceeding the response of other bacteria present, together with an increase in propionate. These findings suggest that colonisation and mucin degradation by A. muciniphila is dependent on pH and the concentration of mucin. Our results revealed the preference of A. muciniphila for the distal colon environment due to its higher pH and uncovered the quick and stable response of A. muciniphila to mucin supplementation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28212864>GPR43 activation enhances psoriasis-like inflammation through epidermal upregulation of IL-6 and dual oxidase 2 signaling in a murine model.</a></h2><p>The  is densely inhabited by commensal bacteria, which metabolize dietary fibers/undigested carbohydrates and produce short-chain fatty acids such as . GPR43 is one of the receptors to sense short-chain fatty acids, and expressed in various immune and non-immune cells. /GPR43 signaling has been shown to affect various inflammatory diseases through Th17 responses and NADPH oxidase (NOX)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. However, no study has previously explored the effects of GPR43 activation during psoriasis-like inflammation. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of /phenylacetamide (GPR43 agonists) on imiquimod induced skin inflammation in mice. Mice were administered phenylacetamide/ followed by assessment of skin inflammation, NOXs (NOX-2, NOX-4, dual oxidases), and Th17 related signaling. Our study showed induction of epidermal GPR43 after imiquimod treatment, i.e. psoriasis-like inflammation.  administration in psoriatic mice led to further increase in skin inflammation (ear thickness/myeloperoxidase activity) with concurrent increase in Th17 immune responses and epidermal dual oxidase-2 signaling. Further, topical application of GPR43 agonist, phenylacetamide led to enhanced ear thickness with concomitant epidermal IL-6 signaling as well as dual oxidase-2 upregulation which may be responsible for increased psoriasis-like inflammation. Taken together, dual oxidase-2 and IL-6 play important roles in GPR43-mediated skin inflammation.

Seven pairs of newborn twin lambs were used. Within each pair, lambs were assigned to receive an oral infusion of SB at 0.36 g/kg body weight (BW) (SB, n = 7) or the same volume of saline (Con, n = 7). Treatments were administered from 10 to 49 d of age, when all lambs were slaughtered.

Moreover, SB infusion also upregulated (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 (IGFBP-5), and downregulated (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) in the rumen epithelia. Sodium butyrate infusion also enhanced (P < 0.05) gene expressions of monocarboxylate transporter isoform 1 (MCT1), downregulated in adenoma (DRA), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase isoform 2 (HMGCS2), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HMGCL), while depressed (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of sodium/proton exchanger isoform 2 (NHE2) in the rumen epithelia. Our results suggest that the SB infusion can improve animal performance, promote the ruminal papillae growth, and enhance expression of genes related to ruminal epithelial VFA uptake and metabolism in preweaning twin lambs.

Cooked PSC improved glucose tolerance by approximately 30% ( < 0.05), and raw and cooked PSC diets reduced insulin response by 53% and 56% respectively ( < 0.05 and  < 0.01), compared to HFD (containing cellulose as the source of dietary fiber). 16S rRNA gene sequencing on fecal samples showed a significant shift in the overall microbial composition of PSC groups when compared to HFD and low fat diet (LFD) controls. At the family level, PSC increased the abundance of  and  ( < 0.001), and decreased  ( < 0.01) compared with HFD. This was accompanied by increased mRNA expression of mucin genes Muc1, Muc2, and Muc4 in ileal  ( < 0.05). Serum levels of  and propionate increased with raw PSC diet ( < 0.01). These results indicate that supplementation of HFD with PSC fractions can improve glycemia and may have a protective role against HFD-induced alterations in  microbiota and mucus layer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25497601>Control of appetite and energy intake by SCFA: what are the potential underlying mechanisms?</a></h2><p>In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the role of dietary fibre in obesity management. Much of this interest stems from animal and human studies which suggest that an increased intake of fermentable fibre can suppress appetite and improve weight management. A growing number of reports have demonstrated that the principal products of colonic fermentation of dietary fibre, SCFA, contribute to energy homeostasis via effects on multiple cellular metabolic pathways and receptor-mediated mechanisms. In particular, over the past decade it has been identified that a widespread receptor system exists for SCFA. These G-protein-coupled receptors, free fatty acid receptor (FFAR) 2 and FFAR3 are expressed in numerous tissue sites, including the   and adipose tissue. Investigations using FFAR2- or FFAR3-deficient animal models suggest that SCFA-mediated stimulation of these receptors enhances the release of the anorectic hormones peptide tyrosine tyrosine and glucagon-like peptide-1 from colonic L cells and leptin from adipocytes. In addition, the SCFA  has recently been shown to have a direct role in central appetite regulation. Furthermore, the SCFA propionate is a known precursor for hepatic glucose production, which has been reported to suppress feeding behaviour in ruminant studies through the stimulation of hepatic vagal afferents. The present review therefore proposes that an elevated colonic production of SCFA could stimulate numerous hormonal and neural signals at different organ and tissue sites that would cumulatively suppress short-term appetite and energy intake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211831>Intestinal Inflammation Modulates the Epithelial Response to Butyrate in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Butyrate-producing  bacteria are reduced in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), supporting the hypothesis that butyrate supplementation may be beneficial in this setting. Nonetheless, earlier studies suggest that the oxidation of butyrate in IBD patients is altered. We propose that inflammation may decrease epithelial butyrate consumption.Non-IBD controls and IBD patients were recruited for the study. Stool samples were used for short-chain fatty acid and bacterial butyryl CoA: CoA-transferase quantification. Colonic biopsies and ex vivo differentiated epithelial organoids (d-EpOCs) treated with butyrate and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) were used for analyzing the expression of transporters MCT1 and ABCG2, metabolic enzyme ACADS, and butyrate receptor GPR43, and for butyrate metabolism and consumption assays.We observed that lower stool content of butyrate-producing bacteria in active IBD patients did not correlate with decreased butyrate concentrations. Indeed, the intestinal epithelial expression of MCT1, ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 was altered in active IBD patients. Nonetheless, d-EpOCs derived from IBD patients showed SLC16A1 (gene encoding for MCT1 protein), ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 expression levels comparable to controls. Moreover, IBD- and non-IBD-derived d-EpOCs responded similarly to butyrate, as assessed by transcriptional regulation. TNFα significantly altered SLC16A1, ABCG2, and GPR43 transcription in d-EpOCs, mimicking the expression profile observed in biopsies from active IBD patients and resulting in reduced butyrate consumption.We provide evidence that the response to butyrate is not intrinsically altered in IBD patients. However, TNFα renders the  less responsive to this metabolite, defeating the purpose of butyrate supplementation during active inflammation.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Interactions between the  microbiota and mucosal immunity are considered to be a crucial etiology. Fructooligosaccharide (FOS), prebiotics have been reported as activators of the  microbiota.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of kestose, the smallest FOS and FOS on atopic dermatitis in mice.An AD mouse model was developed by (ovalbumin) epidermal sensitization using BALB/c mice. Kestose (1%, 5%, and 10%) or FOS (5%, positive control) was orally administered throughout the study.In comparison with the values observed for the control AD mice, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), clinical score, and skin inflammation on histopathology were significantly decreased by the oral administration of kestose. Total IgE, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in skin, and IL-4 were also suppressed by this administration. In addition, the population of CD4Foxp3 cells in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and  concentrations in feces were significantly increased by kestose treatment.These findings suggest that kestose activates the  immune system to induce the tolerance against allergic skin inflammations in AD.Copyright © 2017 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.
