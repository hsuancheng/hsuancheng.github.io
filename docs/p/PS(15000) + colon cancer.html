<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26871294>The relationship between EZH2 expression and microRNA-31 in colorectal  and the role in evolution of the serrated pathway.</a></h2><p>Polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a methyltransferase that correlates with the regulation of invasion and metastasis and is overexpressed in human cancers such as colorectal . MicroRNA-31 (miR-31) plays an oncogenic role and is associated with BRAF mutation and poor prognosis in colorectal . EZH2 is functionally considered to suppress miR-31 expression in human cancers; however, no study has reported its relationship with  . We therefore evaluated EZH2 expression using immunohistochemistry and assessed miR-31 and epigenetic alterations using 301 colorectal carcinomas and 207 premalignant lesions. Functional analysis was performed to identify the association between EZH2 and miR-31 using  cell lines. In the current study, negative, weak, moderate, and strong EZH2 expressions were observed in %, 19%, 25%, and 41% of colorectal cancers, respectively. EZH2 was inversely associated with miR-31 (P < .0001), independent of clinicopathological and molecular features. In a multivariate stage-stratified analysis, high EZH2 expression was related to favorable prognosis (P = .0022). Regarding premalignant lesions, negative EZH2 expression was frequently detected in sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/) (76%; P < .0001) compared with hyperplastic polyps, traditional serrated adenomas, and non-serrated adenomas (25-36%). Functional analysis demonstrated that the knockdown of EZH2 increased miR-31 expression. In conclusion, an inverse association was identified between EZH2 and miR-31 in colorectal cancers. Our data also showed that upregulation of EZH2 expression may be rare in SSA/. These results suggest that EZH2 suppresses miR-31 in colorectal  and may correlate with differentiation and evolution of serrated pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31266008>Effect of Reasons for Screen Failure on Subsequent Treatment Outcomes in  Patients Assessed for Clinical Trials.</a></h2><p>The  research community increasingly question the rigidity of eligibility criteria in clinical trials. Common reasons for "screen failure" (RFSF) are well documented; however, their effect on subsequent standard therapy (SST) and outcomes is unclear.This retrospective study evaluated patients aged ≥18 years with solid malignancy who were listed as ineligible on a screening log between February 2011 and March 2018. Patients screen-failed for biomarker results or incorrect  stage/prior treatment profile were excluded. Data were collected from electronic hospital records, including demographics,  history, RFSF, subsequent therapy, and outcomes.Overall, 217 patients were eligible. The most common histologies were lung (28%), melanoma, , and pancreatic (all 11%); 90% were metastatic. The most common RFSF were rapid disease progression (PD; 16%), performance status () ≥2 (12%), and abnormal liver function tests (aLFT; 12%). After screen failure, 129/217 (59%) had SST; 9 were dose-reduced. Treatment-naïve or phase III trial-ineligible patients were more likely to receive SST than those pre-treated or phase I trial-ineligible (72/104 vs. 52/113, p = .0006; 71/109 vs. /42, p = .00013), respectively. RFSF stabilised/improved in 104/217 (48%); the main RFSF was co-morbidity (19/104). The most common RFSF to deteriorate were rapid PD (27/72),  ≥2 (20/72), and aLFT with liver metastases (LM; 13/72).RFSF related to organ function rarely deteriorate unless directly involved with underlying malignancy. Most RFSF do not prevent patients from having SST, nor increase dose reductions, especially in treatment-naïve/phase III trial-ineligible patients. Those with RFSF of poor , rapid PD, and aLFT from LM are less suitable for SST. Careful broadening of trial eligibility is warranted.© 2019 S.

This large population contains patients unfit for treatment, those suitable for monotherapy or for doublets and the impact of chemotherapy outside clinical trial is unclear. The aim of the study was to retrospectively analyse Overall Survival(OS) of elderly metastatic colorectal (mCRC) patients treated with chemotherapy in daily practice.Kaplan-Meir method was used for OS, the log-rank or Tarone-Ware test for differences between subgroups, Cox's proportional hazard model to assess the impact of known prognostic factors and treatment.751 patients with mCRC observed between January 2000 and January 2013 were collected. Median age was 79 year(75-93); Male/Female 61/39%, ECOG- -1/2 85/%; /rectum 74/26%; multiple metastatic sites 34%, only liver metastasis in 41% of patients. KRAS status was studied in 35% of patients: 44% of them showed gene mutation. 20.5% of patients did not received any kind of treatment including surgery. Comorbidities observed: cardiovascular 34%, diabetes 14%, hypertension 50%. Primary tumor was resected in 80.6%; surgery of liver metastasis was done in 19% of patients (2.3% of patients >80years). 78% of patients underwent chemotherapy. Median follow up was 12 months(range 1-124). Median OS was 17 months (CI 95%-19);median OS in no-treated patients was 5 months (4-6); mOS of patients with at least one treatment was 20 months (18-22). In KRAS mutated group median OS was 19months (-23) while in KRAS wild type patients median OS was 25 months (20-30). At multivariate analysis sex(Female), age(<80y), performance status(-1), chemotherapy, Surgery of metastasis, Surgery of primary tumor and Site of metastasis(liver) were prognostic factors for OS.The results of our study show that in clinical practice treatment has a positive impact on OS of elderly patients, confirmed at multivariate analysis, included patients with age >80 years old or with a poor performance status (respectively p<.0001 and p<.0001). KRAS analysis deserve further evaluation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853806>Efficacy of second-line chemotherapy after a first-line triplet in patients with metastatic colorectal .</a></h2><p>Exposing patients with metastatic colorectal  (mcrc) to all three active chemotherapeutic agents (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil) has improved survival. The benefit of second-line chemotherapy after a first-line triplet is not clearly defined. We evaluated the efficacy of second-line chemotherapy in patients who had received first-line triplet therapy.The medical records of patients treated on a prospective trial of first-line triplet therapy were reviewed for second-line treatment. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to establish factors of prognostic significance.Of the 53 patients who received first-line triplet therapy, 28 (53%) received second-line chemotherapy [13 men; 8 with a  primary; mutant  in 10, wild-type in , and unknown status in 3; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status () of 1 in 16 patients,  2 in 3,  3 in 2, and unknown in 7; involved organs: liver in 17 patients, lung in 16, and peritoneum in 8]. Second-line chemotherapy consisted of xelox or folfox in 13 patients, xeliri or folfiri in 12, and single-agent irinotecan in 3. Concurrent bevacizumab was given in 16 patients (57%), and cetuximab, in 2 (7%). Median survival was 28. months [95% confidence interval (ci): 22.8 months to 33.2 months] for patients receiving second-line therapy and 23. months (95% ci: 13.2 months to 32.8 months) for those not receiving it. Best response was partial in 6 patients (21%), stable disease in 11 (39%), and progressive disease in 11 (39%). Median progression-free survival was 4.8 months (95% ci: 2.4 months to 9.6 months), and overall survival was  months (95% ci: 9.6 months to 20.4 months).Second-line chemotherapy after first-line triplet therapy in mcrc is feasible and suggests efficacy comparable to that reported for second-line therapy after a doublet, regardless of the agent used.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30690930>Efficacy and safety of FOLFIRI/aflibercept in second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal  in a real-world population: Prognostic and predictive markers.</a></h2><p>The phase III VELOUR trial demonstrated efficacy with combined FOLFIRI-aflibercept in patients with metastatic colorectal  previously treated with oxaliplatin with or without bevacizumab versus placebo. The effect of FOLFIRI-aflibercept in routine clinical practice was evaluated.Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), response and safety were analysed for 78 patients treated with FOLFIRI-aflibercept at six GITuD institutions. Exploratory analyses of prognostic and predictive markers of efficacy were performed.Patients had good general status ( -1 96.2%), tumours were mostly RAS-mutant (75.6%), synchronous (71.8%), and left-sided (71.8%). Prior therapy included bevacizumab (47.4%) and anti-EGFR agents (12.8%). PFS was longer for metachronous than synchronous tumours (11. vs 5. months, P = .028), and for left- tumours (7. vs 3. months, P = .044). RAS-mutant status, first-line treatment and primary tumour surgery did not impact PFS. The disease control rate was 70.5%. The most common grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (.3%), asthenia (10.3%), diarrhea and mucositis (6.4% each). Dysphonia was reported in 39.7% of patients, and grade 3 hypertension in 3.8%. Development of hypertension (any grade) was significantly associated with a reduced risk of progression by multivariate analysis (HR = 2.7; 95%CI 1.3-5.4; P = .001).Efficacy with FOLFIRI-aflibercept in a real-life population was in line with results from the pivotal trial and toxicity was manageable with treatment adaptation. Survival outcomes were not impacted by primary tumour location, RAS-mutant status, first-line treatment or primary tumour surgery. Hypertension may be a surrogate marker of efficacy in this patient population.© 2018 The Authors.

Both PSs are highly water-soluble, provide only very limited luminescence emission at 580-680 nm following excitation at 530 nm, and demonstrate high photostability with less than 50% photobleaching at radiant exposures H = 275 J cm(-2) (530 nm irradiation). It was previously shown that these two photosensitizers exhibit a large singlet oxygen ((1)O2) quantum yield (Φ (Δ) ∼.99 in acetonitrile). Their photon-mediated efficacy to cause cell death (λ = 530 nm, H = 45 J cm(-2)) was tested in vitro in  and glioma  cell lines (CT26.WT, CT26.CL25, F98, and U87) and demonstrated a strong photodynamic effect with complete cell death at concentrations as low as 4 and 1 μM for TLD1411 and TLD1433, respectively. Notably, dark toxicity was negligible at concentrations less than 25 and 10 μM for TLD1411 and TLD1433, respectively. The ability of the PSs to initiate Type I photoreactions was tested by exposing -treated U87 cells to light under hypoxic conditions (pO2 < .5%), which resulted in a complete loss of the PDT effect. In vivo, the maximum tolerated doses 50 (MTD50) were determined to be 36 mg kg(-1) (TLD1411) and 103 mg kg(-1) (TLD1433) using the BALB/c murine model. In vivo growth delay studies in the subcutaneous  adenocarcinoma CT26.WT murine model were conducted at a photosensitizer dose equal to .5 and .2 MTD50 for TLD1411 and TLD1433, respectively. 4 hours post  injection, tumours were irradiated with continuous wave or pulsed light sources (λ = 525-530 nm, H = 192 J cm(-2)). Overall, treatment with continuous wave light demonstrated a higher tumour destruction efficacy when compared to pulsed light. TLD1433 mediated PDT resulted in statistically significant longer animal survival compared to TLD1411. Two-thirds of TLD1433-treated mice survived more than 100 days (p < .01) whereas TLD1411-treated mice did not survive longer than 20 days. Here we present evidence that two novel PSs have very potent photo-biological properties and are able to cause PDT-mediated cell death in both in vitro cell culture models and in vivo tumour regression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26330262>Evaluation of dual-wavelength excitation autofluorescence imaging of colorectal tumours with a high-sensitivity CMOS imager: a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>It is important to devise efficient and easy methods of detecting colorectal tumours to reduce mortality from colorectal . Dual-wavelength excitation autofluorescence intensity can be used to visualize colorectal tumours. Therefore, we evaluated dual-wavelength excitation autofluorescence images of colorectal tumours obtained with a newly developed, high-sensitivity complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) imager.A total 107 colorectal tumours (44 adenomas, 43 adenocarcinomas with intramucosal invasion, and 20 sessile serrated adenoma/polyps [SSA/]) in 98 patients who underwent endoscopic tumour resection were included. The specimens were irradiated with excitation light at 365 nm and 405 nm, and autofluorescence images measured with a 475 ± 25-nm band pass filter were obtained using a new, high-sensitivity CMOS imager. Ratio images (F365ex/F405ex) were created to evaluate the lesion brightness compared with that of normal mucosa, and specimens were categorized into a no signal or high signal group.Adenomas and adenocarcinomas were depicted in 87 ratio images, with 86.2% (n = 75) in the High signal group. SSA/P was depicted in 20 ratio images, with 70.% (n = 14) in the High signal group.Dual-wavelength excitation autofluorescence images of colorectal tumours can be acquired using our high-sensitivity CMOS imager, and are useful in detecting colorectal tumours.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30082548>Safety and antitumor activity of arsenic trioxide plus infusional 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan as second-line chemotherapy for refractory metastatic colorectal : A pilot study from South India.</a></h2><p>After failing oxaliplatin-based first-line chemotherapy (CT), approximately 4%-21% of patients with metastatic colorectal  (mCRC) respond to irinotecan-based second-line treatment. Earlier studies have demonstrated that arsenic trioxide (ATO) can significantly resensitize resistant   to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by downregulating thymidylate synthase (TS). We hypothesized that a combination of ATO with infusional 5-FU, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) regimen in mCRC patients refractory to first-line FOLFOX/CAPOX could further improve the outcome of second-line CT.Patients were administered ATO . mg/kg/day on days 1-2 along with FOLFIRI regimen at standard doses every 2 weeks, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patients' refusal. Responses to CT were reported according to RECIST 1.1. Adverse events were classified based on CTCAE version 4..Between September 2016 and July 2017, 17 patients with refractory mCRC were treated with this investigational combination. The median age was 49 years; 13 males and 4 females; ECOG  -1/2, 14/3. The most common site of metastases was liver (n = 11) followed by peritoneum (n = 7) and number of involved metastatic sites 1-2/≥3, 9/8. After 6 cycles of CT, overall response rate and disease control rate were 17.6% and 82.4%, respectively (complete remission = , partial remission = 3 patients, stable disease = 11 patients). Median progression-free survival was 5.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.3-7.) and median overall survival was 9 months (95% CI: 7.4-10.5) from the initiation of ATO plus FOLFIRI. The toxicities were as follows: Grade 1/2 toxicity: fatigue (7 patients), constipation (2), and nausea and vomiting (2); Grade 3 toxicity: fatigue (3), neutropenia (2), febrile neutropenia (1), diarrhea (2), and QTc prolongation (1). No patient experienced Grade 4 toxicities.The addition of ATO to FOLFIRI regimen as second-line CT in patients with refractory mCRC offered an encouraging antitumor effect at the cost of manageable toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27092327>Frequency of coexistent carcinoma in sessile serrated adenoma/polyps and traditional serrated adenomas removed by endoscopic resection.</a></h2><p>Sessile serrated adenoma/polyps (SSA/) have a different potential than traditional adenomatous polyps for developing into malignant colorectal . However, little is known about the coexistent  rate. Here, we evaluate the frequency of carcinoma in serrated polyps removed by endoscopic resection (ER).This was a retrospective single-center cohort study of consecutive patients with colorectal polyps who underwent ER from March 2003 to October 2014. We determined the frequency of serrated polyps among all resected colorectal polyps and analyzed the clinicopathological findings as well as the frequency and characteristics of coexistent carcinoma in the serrated polyps resected by ER based on pathology reports.A total of 21,048 polyps from ,326 patients were identified, including ,984 traditional adenomatous polyps (75.9 %), 621 SSA/ (3. %), 136 traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs) (.6 %), 1,121 hyperplastic polyps (5.3 %), and 3,186 polyps of other types (.1 %). The clinical and endoscopic findings of SSA/ revealed a male predominance (68.6 %), with 61.7 % of the polyps located in the proximal . Males accounted for 77.2 % of all patients with TSAs, and 77.2 % of these polyps were located in the distal . The mean sizes of the SSA/ and TSAs were 8.8 and 10.7 mm, respectively. Among the SSA/, 8 (1.3 %) cases had coexistent carcinoma, and 1 (.7 %) patient with TSA showed coexistent carcinoma. In the patients with SSA/, female sex and a tumor size ≥ 10 mm were predictive factors for coexistent carcinoma.The frequency of SSA/ with carcinoma was lower than that for traditional adenoma. Female sex and tumor size ≥ 10 mm were significant predictive factors for coexistent carcinoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27498176>Fecal Immunochemical Test Detects Sessile Serrated Adenomas and Polyps With a Low Level of Sensitivity.</a></h2><p>The serrated pathway is a distinct pathway of colorectal carcinogenesis that has been implicated in development of a substantial proportion of interval colorectal cancers. The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) detects early neoplasms with a higher level of sensitivity than the guaiac test. We investigated the sensitivity of the FIT in detection of sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/).We performed a prospective study of 6198 asymptomatic subjects (mean age, 59. ± 7. years) who received concurrent screening colonoscopies and FITs at the Health Management Center of National Taiwan University Hospital from August 2010 through November 2014. The sensitivity of FIT for conventional adenoma, advanced adenoma, and SSA/P at different cutoffs was calculated, and results were compared by using multivariate analysis adjusted for potential confounders.Prevalence values of SSA/P, adenoma, and advanced adenoma were 1.4%, 20.2%, and 5.5%, respectively. At cutoffs of 10, , and 20 μg hemoglobin/g feces, the FIT detected all SSA/ with 12.3%, 6.2%, and 6.2% sensitivity, large SSA/ with 18.4%, 10.5%, and 10.5% sensitivity, and advanced adenomas with 32.4%, 24.5%, and 20.9% sensitivity, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that positive results from the FIT did not differ significantly between individuals with SSA/P and those with non-advanced adenoma or those with negative findings from colonoscopy. Patients with large SSA/ were less likely to have positive results from the FIT than patients with advanced adenoma, with odds ratios of .44 (95% confidence interval [CI], .18-1.05), .30 (95% CI, .10-.90), and .37 (95% CI, .12-1.12) at cutoffs of 10, , and 20 μg hemoglobin/g feces, respectively, after adjusting for lesion size, even with synchronous conventional adenoma.In a prospective study of 6198 subjects receiving the FIT and colonoscopy, we found that the FIT detected SSA/ with significantly lower levels of sensitivity than conventional adenoma. Further studies are needed to determine the effects of these findings on the effectiveness of FIT-based colorectal  screening program.Copyright © 2017 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The data of 7 384 patients who underwent colonoscopy at the Center of Digestive Endoscopy, Peking University International Hospital from August 1, 2016 to February 29, 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. WLE and IEE[Fuji intelligent chromo endoscopy (FICE) or Blue Laser Imaging (BLI) ]were used to compare the morphological features of SSA/P with HP, SSA/P-CD(+)with SSA/P-CD(-). The diagnostic values of endoscopic features in SSA/P and SSA/P-CD(+)were analyzed.  A total of 3 401 polyps were detected in 7 384 patients, including 164 SSA/ (135 patients). During the same period, there were 270 HPs (223 patients) in accordance with the admission criteria. Compared with HP group, SSA/P group was more common in the right  with a diameter5 mm and more likely to be manifested as: Ⅱ-O pit pattern, surface mucus, cumulus-like surface, irregular morphology, VMV, redness, and also more likely to be associated with  adenoma,   elsewhere in the colorectum. The differences were statistically significant (.01). Compared with SSA/P-CD(-)group, SSA/P-CD(+)group was more common in the right  with a diameter5 mm and more likely to be manifested as: Ⅱ-O pit pattern, surface mucus, cumulus-like surface, irregular morphology, VMV. The differences were statistically significant (.001). The differential diagnosis between SSA/P and HP was predicted by combining any two endoscopic morphological features (right , Ⅱ-O pit pattern, surface mucus, cumulus surface, irregular morphology, VMV, diameter5 mm, at least 2 of 7 endoscopic features). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 59.%, 95.56%, 81.80%, 13.32 and .43, respectively. Similarly, the differential diagnosis between SSA/P-CD(+) and HP was predicted. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 92.16%, 95.56%, 95.02%, 20.76 and .08, respectively.  Comprehensive analysis of the WLE and FICE/BLI morphological features of the lesions can effectively distinguish SSA/P from HP, especially SSA/P-CD(+) from HP.</p></html>
