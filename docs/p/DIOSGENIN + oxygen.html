Autophagic flux and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscope. Apoptosis was observed by flow cytometry. All proteins expression was examined by western blotting.Autophagy induction was demonstrated by examination of autophagic flux including autophagosomes accumulation, autophagosome-lysosome fusion and degradation of autophagosomes. Moreover, blocking autophagy with inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) and 3-methyladenine (3-MA), enhanced -induced apoptosis, indicating the protective effect of autophagy in -treated CML cells. Further study suggested that -induced autophagy and cytotoxicity were accompanied by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway inhibition. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) administration, a scavenger agent of ROS, could down-regulate -induced autophagy via reversion of mTOR pathway inhibition.These results indicate that  obviously generates ROS and this oxidative pressure not only produces cytotoxic effect on CML cells but also induces autophagy.

Both types of receptors are activated by oxysterols, cholesterol metabolites with oxidized side chains. Restricting the movement of the oxysterol side chain to certain orientations may have profound effects in the activity profile, however this has not been explored so far. In a first attempt to obtain analogues of natural ligands of DAF-12 and LXR with restricted side chain mobility we introduced a 16,22-oxygen bridge in 26-hydroxycholesterol, a cholestenoic acid and a dafachronic acid (5-7).  was used as starting material, the key step to obtain the 16,22 epoxy functionality was the one pot formation and reduction of a cyclic hemiketal via the oxocarbenium ion using sodium cyanoborohydride. All new compounds were characterized by NMR and mass spectrometry and assayed as ceDAF-12 or LXR ligands in transactivation cell-based assays. The dafachronic acid analogue 7 behaved as a ceDAF-12 agonist.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, (3β, 25R)‑spirost‑5‑en‑3‑oxyl (2‑((2((2‑aminoethyl)amino)ethyl)amino)ethyl) carbamate (DGP), a new synthetic  derivative incorporating primary amine was used to investigate its anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of action in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial BV2 cells. Pretreatment with DGP resulted in significant inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, and down-regulation of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in LPS-stimulated microglial BV2 cells. In addition, DGP decreased the production of reactive  species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). The inhibitory effects of DGP on these inflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated microglial BV2 cells were regulated by NF-κB signaling through blocking p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB p65/DNA binding activity. DGP also blocked the phosphorylation of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), but not p38 kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). The NF-κB inhibitor JSH-23 and JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 significantly decreased NO production and IL-6 release in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells, respectively. The overall results demonstrate that DGP has anti-inflammatory effects on LPS-stimulated BV2 cells via inhibition of NF-κB and JNK activation, suggesting that DGP is a potential prophylactic agent in various neurodegenerative disorders.Copyright © 2018.

Herein, we evaluated the anti-cancer activity of dioscin for proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in HepG2 cancer cells. Initially, dioscin was purified and identified from Polygonatum sibiricum by HPLC, MS, and NMR analysis, respectively. Dioscin inhibited the cell multiplication at IC of 8.34 μM, altered the cell morphology, arrested the cell cycle in G2/M phase and led to considerable programmed cell death. Furthermore, it has efficiently promoted the mitochondrial pathway and death receptor pathway. The inhibition of Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 proteins in these pathways abolished the dioscin induced apoptosis significantly; while dioscin inhibited the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Moreover, dioscin exposure led to enhanced intracellular ROS generation and the mRNA expression of JNK gene which emphasized their involvement in the apoptosis process in HepG2 cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Screening results in MC65 neuroblastoma cells established that compound 38 with a spacer length of 17 atoms exhibited the highest protective potency with an EC50 of 111.7 ± 9.0 nM. A reduction in protective activity was observed as spacer length was increased up to 28 atoms and there is a clear structural preference for attachment to the methylene carbon between the two carbonyl moieties of curcumin. Further study suggested that antioxidative ability and inhibitory effects on amyloid-β oligomer (AβO) formation may contribute to the neuroprotective outcomes. Additionally, compound 38 was found to bind directly to Aβ, similar to curcumin, but did not form complexes with the common biometals Cu, Fe, and Zn. Altogether, these results give strong evidence to support the bivalent design strategy in developing novel compounds with multifunctional ability for the treatment of AD.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we investigated the effects of dioscin (DSN) on human GBC and the potential mechanisms underlying these effects. The results showed that DSN significantly inhibited GBC cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, DSN induced GBC cell apoptosis via mitochondrial dependent apoptotic signalling. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) levels were measured, and ROS scavengers completely inhibited DSN-induced apoptosis and migration, indicating that ROS play an essential role in GBC progression. Western blot analysis showed that AKT activity was significantly downregulated after DSN treatment, and that inhibition/ectopic expression of AKT enhanced/abolished DSN-induced apoptosis but not migration. Furthermore, we confirmed the relationship between ROS and the PI3K/AKT pathway and found that DSN induced apoptosis by regulating ROS-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling. Taken together, these findings indicate that DSN induces GBC apoptosis through inhibiting ROS-mediated PI3K/AKT signalling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755146>Dioscin induced activation of p38 MAPK and JNK via mitochondrial pathway in HL-60 cell line.</a></h2><p>Saponins have shown promise in cancer prevention and therapy; however, little is known about the detailed signaling pathways underlying their anticancer activities. In the present study, we examined the mechanisms of action of dioscin, a glucosides saponin isolated from Polygonatum zanlanscianense pump, in human myeloblast leukemia HL-60 cells. Dioscin suppressed HL-60 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was due to the induction of apoptosis as revealed by the externalization of phosphatidylserine, and cleavages of lamin A/C and PARP-1. Treatment with dioscin induced apoptosis through activation of caspases 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK contributed to dioscin-induced apoptosis upstream of caspase activation. Using various inhibitors and antioxidant agents, we found that mitochondrial derived reactive  species and depletion of mitochondrial transmembrane potential lead to the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK. Taken together, our results demonstrated that dioscin induces apoptosis by activation of p38 MAPK and JNK through the caspase-dependent mitochondrial death pathway. This work suggests that dioscin may be used as a drug lead for the treatment of myeloblast leukemia.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of dioscin against human gastric carcinoma in vivo were accomplished by the xenografts of MGC-803 cells in BALB/c nude mice.AO/EB and DAPI staining, TEM, single cell gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry assays were used in cell experiments. Then, an iTRAQ-based proteomics approach, DNA and siRNA transfection experiments were carried out for mechanism investigation.In MGC-803 cells, dioscin caused DNA damage and mitochondrial change, induced ROS generation, Ca(2+) release and cell apoptosis, and blocked cell cycle at S phase. In vivo results showed that dioscin significantly suppressed the tumor growth of MGC-803 cell xenografts in nude mice. In addition, dioscin markedly inhibited cell migration, caused Cytochrome c release and adjusted mitochondrial signal pathway. Then, an iTRAQ-based proteomics approach was carried out and 121 differentially expressed proteins were found, in which five biomarkers associated with cell cycle, apoptosis and migration were evaluated. Dioscin significantly up-regulated the levels of GALR-2 and RBM-3, and down-regulated CAP-1, Tribbles-2 and CliC-3. Furthermore, overexpressed DNA transfection of CAP-1 enhanced cell migration and invasion, which was decreased by dioscin. SiRNA to Tribbles-2 affected the protein levels of Bcl-2, Bax and MAPKs, suggesting that dioscin decreased Tribbles-2 level leading to cell apoptosis.Our works confirmed the activity of dioscin against gastric cancer.

In the present study, we used proteomics to examine the cytotoxic effect of dioscin, a glucoside saponin, on human myeloblast leukemia HL-60 cells. Dioscin induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells in a time-dependent manner. Protein profiling of the microsomal fraction with enriched plasma membrane proteins isolated from HL-60 cells revealed that proteins act as chaperones and/or mediators of protein folding and were substantially altered in expression cells upon dioscin stimuli. Further biochemical study indicated that mitochondria dysfunction caused generation of reactive  species (ROS), leading to the changes in protein expression. The mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi m) inhibitor aristolochic acid (ArA) partially abrogated the dioscin-initiated death receptor apoptosis pathway and cell death.

Cell death, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), intracellular reactive  species (ROS) generation, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were measured on a flow cytometry. Caspase activation, ER stress, and MMP-dependent apoptosis proteins in cervical cancer cells in response to PD were determined by Western blot analysis. The ability of ATF4 binding to ChIP promoter was measured using the ChIP assay.We demonstrated that PD inhibits cell viability, causes a loss of mitochondrial function, and induces apoptosis, as evidenced by up-regulation of caspase-8, -3, -9, -PARP, and Bax activation, and down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression. PD was shown to induce ROS and the ER stress pathway, including GRP78, p-eIF-2α, ATF4, and CHOP. Pre-treatment with NAC, a ROS production inhibitor, significantly reduced ER stress and apoptosis-related proteins induced by PD. Transfection of GRP78/CHOP-siRNA effectively inhibited PD-induced ER stress-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with PD significantly increased p38 and JNK activation. Co-administration of a JNK inhibitor (SP600125) or p38 inhibitor (SB203580) abolished cell death and ER stress effects during PD treatment.

In this work, an in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) model and an in vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model were used. The results indicated that dioscin clearly protected PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons against OGD/R insult and significantly prevented cerebral I/R injury.

Pretreatment with NAC slightly inhibited the expression levels of c-FLIPL downregulated by the treatment of dioscin, suggesting that dioscin is partially dependent on the generation of ROS for downregulation of c-FLIPL. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that dioscin enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human renal cancer cells by downregulation of c-FLIPL and Bcl-2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26666021>[Preliminary study on hepatotoxicity induced by dioscin and its possible mechanism].</a></h2><p>Dioscin has a wide range of biological effects and broad application prospects. However the studies concerning the toxicology and mechanism of dioscin is small. This article is to study the hepatotoxicity of dioscin and the effect of dioscin treatment on expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) mRNA and CYP1A mRNA and protein in HepG2 cells in vitro. Dioscin 0.5-32 µmol · L(-1) exposed to HepG2 cells for 12 h, cell viability was examined by CCK-8 assay and the release rate of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was to evaluate cell membrane damage. HepG2 cells morphologic changes were quantified by inverted Microscope, and the effect on production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression of CYP1A and AhR was evaluated by RT-RCR. The protein expression of CYP1A1 was detected by western blot. The cell viability was significantly inhibited after HepG2 cells were exposed to dioscin 0.5-32 µmol · L(-1). Compared with the control, the LDH release rate and ROS were significantly increased. The expression of CYPlA and AhR mRNA was increased. The expression of CYP1Al protein was increased after dioscin treatment, and resveratrol, an AhR antagonist, could downregulate the expression of CYP1A1. It follows that large doses dioscin has potential hepatotoxicity. The possible mechanism may be dioscin can active aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and induce the expression of CYP1A.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27626275>Ca2+ Entry, Oxidative Stress, Ceramide and Suicidal Erythrocyte Death Following  Treatment.</a></h2><p>The bioactive steroid sapogenin  is considered for a wide variety of applications including treatment of malignancy. The substance counteracts tumor growth in part by stimulating apoptosis of tumor cells. Similar to apoptosis of nucleated cells, erythrocytes may enter suicidal death or eryptosis, which is characterized by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine translocation to the erythrocyte surface. Signaling involved in the stimulation of eryptosis includes increase of cytosolic Ca2+ activity ([Ca2+]i), oxidative stress and ceramide. The present study explored, whether  induces eryptosis and, if so, to decipher cellular mechanisms involved.Flow cytometry was employed to estimate phosphatidylserine exposure at the cell surface from annexin-V-binding, cell volume from forward scatter, [Ca2+]i from Fluo3-fluorescence, ROS formation from DCF dependent fluorescence, and ceramide abundance utilizing specific antibodies. Hemolysis was quantified by determination of haemoglobin concentration in the supernatant.A 48 hours exposure of human erythrocytes to  significantly increased the percentage of annexin-V-binding cells (≥ 5 µM), significantly decreased forward scatter (15 µM), significantly increased Fluo3-fluorescence (≥ 10 µM), significantly increased DCF fluorescence (15 µM), significantly increased ceramide abundance (15 µM) and significantly increased hemolysis (15 µM). The effect of  (15 µM) on annexin-V-binding was significantly blunted but not abolished by removal of extracellular Ca2+. stimulates eryptosis with erythrocyte shrinkage and phospholipid scrambling of the erythrocyte cell membrane, an effect paralleled by and at least in part due to Ca2+ entry, oxidative stress and ceramide.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

PD is a saponin originally found in a tradition Chinese medicinal herb Paris polyphylla. It has been used to treat liver cancer in China for many years. We evaluated the cell-killing mechanisms of this compound in R-HepG2 and its parental cells. The mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was found to be involved in the PD-induced apoptosis because PD elicited depolarization of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim), generation of H2O2, as well as release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In conclusion, we show for the first time that PD is a potent anticancer agent that can overcome drug resistance in R-HepG2 cells and elicit programmed cell death via mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15464098>Activation of iberiotoxin-sensitive, Ca2+-activated K+ channels of porcine isolated left anterior descending coronary artery by .</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to determine the vasodilating effect of 3beta-hydroxy-5-spirostene (), a phytoestrogen found in wild yams, using porcine resistance left anterior descending coronary artery.

Macrophages are cells responsible for the development of the immunological response reaction, liberating more than one hundred compounds into the extracellular environment. Among these are the various cytokines and the intermediate compounds of nitrogen (NO) and  (H2O2). This coordinated sequence of biochemical reactions is known as the "oxidative burst." When we compared the results with those obtained with zymosan (an important stimulator of H2O2) we observed that the compounds showing the highest activity were substances 2 (tingenone), 16 (reserpine) and 20. Other substances such as compounds 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 23, 24, 26, and 27 also showed a certain activity, but with less intensity than the aforementioned ones.

However, the mechanism of solanine-suppressing prostate cancer cell growth remains to be elucidated. This study investigates the inhibition mechanism of solanine on cancer development in vivo and in cultured human prostate cancer cell DU145 in vitro. Results show that solanine injection significantly suppresses the tumor cell growth in xenograft athymic nude mice. Solanine regulates the protein levels of cell cycle proteins, including Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, and P21 in vivo and in vitro. Also, in cultured DU145 cell, solanine significantly inhibits cell growth. Moreover, the administration of NAC, an active oxygen scavenger, markedly reduces solanine-induced cell death. Blockade of P38 MAPK kinase cannot suppress reactive oxygen species (ROS), but can suppress solanine-induced cell apoptosis. Also, inhibition of ROS by NAC inactivates P38 pathway. Taken together, the data suggest that inhibition of prostate cancer growth by solanine may be through blocking the expression of cell cycle proteins and inducing apoptosis via ROS and activation of P38 pathway. These findings indicate an attractive therapeutic potential of solanine for suppression of prostate cancer.© 2016 The Authors.

Protodioscin is a saponin whose steroidal moiety has some similarities to plant steroidal hormones, brassinosteroids. To test the possibility that protodioscin acts as an agonist or antagonist of brassinosteroids or other plant growth regulators, we compared responses of the weed species Bidens pilosa L. to treatment with protodioscin, brassinosteroids, auxins (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA). Seeds were germinated and grown in agar containing protodioscin, dioscin, brassinolides, IAA and ABA. Root apex respiratory activity was measured with an oxygen electrode. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant enzymes activities were assessed. Protodioscin at 48-240 μm inhibited growth of B. pilosa seedlings. The steroidal hormone 24-epibrassinolide (0.1-5 μm) also inhibited growth of primary roots, but brassicasterol was inactive. IAA at higher concentrations (0.5-10.0 μm) strongly inhibited primary root length and fresh weight of stems. ABA inhibited all parameters of seedling growth and also seed germination. Respiratory activity of primary roots (KCN-sensitive and KCN-insensitive) was activated by protodioscin. IAA and ABA reduced KCN-insensitive respiration. The content of MDA in primary roots increased only after protodioscin treatment. All assayed compounds increased APx and POD activity, with 24-epibrassinolide being most active. The activity of CAT was stimulated by protodioscin and 24-epibrassinolide. The results revealed that protodioscin was toxic to B. pilosa through a mechanism not related to plant growth regulator signalling. Protodioscin caused a disturbance in mitochondrial respiratory activity, which could be related to overproduction of ROS and consequent cell membrane damage.© 2018 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28714320>Anticancer effect of Polyphyllin Ι in colorectal cancer cells through ROS-dependent autophagy and G2/M arrest mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Polyphyllin Ι is a steroidal saponin isolated from the rhizoma of Paris polyphylla.

Using, CCK8 assay, flow cytometry, laser confocal microscope analysis and western blot, the anticancer effects of the polyphyllin Ι were analysed in colorectal cells. Our results indicate that polyphyllin Ι significantly decreased cell viability of HCT 116 cells and induced autophagy. Furthermore, we found that polyphyllin Ι induced autophagy in an ROS-dependent cell death and not related with PI3 K/AKT/mTOR pathway. We also provide evidence that excessive ROS triggered by polyphyllin Ι could induce G2/M phase arrest via regulating cycle proteins expression of cell cycle regulators, such as p21 and cyclinB1.

However, the effect of it on glioblastoma is unclear. In this study, dioscin significantly inhibited proliferation of C6 glioma cells and caused reactive  species (ROS) generation and Ca²⁺ release. ROS accumulation affected levels of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, glutathione disulfide and glutathione, and caused cell apoptosis. In addition, ROS generation caused mitochondrial damage including structural changes, increased mitochondrial permeability transition and decreased mitochondria membrane potential, which led to the release of cytochrome C, nuclear translation of programmed cell death-5 and increased activities of caspase-3,9. Simultaneously, dioscin down-regulated protein expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, up-regulated expression of Bak, Bax, Bid and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Also,  stress induced S-phase arrest of cancer cells by way of regulating expression of DNA Topo I, p53, CDK2 and Cyclin A and caused DNA damage. In a rat allograft model, dioscin significantly inhibited tumor size and extended the life cycle of the rats. In conclusion, dioscin shows noteworthy anti-cancer activity on glioblastoma cells by promoting ROS accumulation, inducing DNA damage and activating mitochondrial signal pathways.

However, its effect on laryngeal cancer remains unknown. In the present paper, our results showed that dioscin markedly caused cell apoptosis and DNA damage, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, induced S-phase arrest, and inhibited invasion of human laryngeal cancer HEp-2 and TU212 cells. Mechanism investigation showed that dioscin markedly up-regulated p53 level, and down-regulated cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and Cyclin A levels. In addition, dioscin significantly down-regulated the levels of p-ERK, Bcl-2, up-regulated the levels of p-JNK, p-p38, Bax, cleaved caspase-3/-9, and caused Cytochrome c release. Furthermore, U0126, an ERK1/2 inhibitor, markedly down-regulated Bcl-2 level, up-regulated the levels of Bax, cleaved caspase-3/9, and enhanced Cytochrome c release inducted by dioscin. While, SP600125 (one JNK inhibitor) and SB203580 (one p38 inhibitor) markedly up-regulated Bcl-2 level, down-regulated the levels of Bax, cleaved caspase-3/9, and obviously boosted Cytochrome c release induced by dioscin. Interestingly, dioscin also markedly down-regulated the levels of MMP2 and MMP9 associated with tumor invasion. Taken together, our study indicated that dioscin suppressed laryngeal cancer cells growth via inducting cell-cycle arrest, MAPK-mediated mitochondrial- derived apoptosis and inhibiting tumor invasion, which could be used as one potential candidate for the treatment of laryngeal cancer in the future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The apoptosis rate was determined by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double staining and flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was used to assay the expression of PRDX1 and apoptotic proteins in the cells. Reactive  species (ROS) formation was measured by 2'7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA).Dioscin considerably inhibited the proliferation of MiaPaCa-2 cells in vitro. The inhibitory action was enhanced in a dose-dependent manner. The levels of intracellular ROS detected with DCFH-DA were highly increased after dioscin treatment. The flow cytometry analysis using annexin V-PI staining showed that compared with the apoptotic rate of control group [(3.5 ± 0.7)%], 2.5 µmol/L and 5 µmol/L dioscin induced apoptosis in (28.4 ± 0.9)% and (49.6 ± 2.7)% MiaPaCa-2 cells, and Western blot analysis showed that apoptotic proteins Bax and cleaved caspase-3 expressions were increased and antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression was decreased. In addition, these effects could be blocked by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration, and the apoptotic rates decreased to (10.8 ± 2.3)% and (18.8 ± 3.0)%, respectively. We further observed the decrease of PRDX1 expression after dioscin treatment. Moreover, after PRDX1 overexpression, dioscin treatment no longer induced high levels of ROS and apoptosis, and the apoptotic rate was decreased to (21.3 ± 5.9)%.Dioscin can down-regulate the PRDX1 expression, and then induces ROS-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15914274>Methyl protodioscin induces G2/M arrest and apoptosis in K562 cells with the hyperpolarization of mitochondria.</a></h2><p>Methyl protodioscin is a furostanol bisglycoside with antitumor properties.

DSG inhibited PPARγ and its target gene expression both in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and  tissues in HF diet-fed mice. Overexpression of PPARγ suppressed DSG-inhibited adipocyte differentiation. DSG significantly increased nuclear expression of ERβ. Inhibition of ERβ significantly suppressed DSG-exerted suppression of adipocyte differentiation and PPARγ expression. In response to DSG stimulation, ERβ bound with RXRα and dissociated RXRα from PPARγ, leading to the reduction of transcriptional activity of PPARγ. These data provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of DSG on adipocyte differentiation and demonstrate that ERβ-exerted regulation of PPARγ expression and activity is critical for DSG-inhibited adipocyte differentiation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

JNK knockdown using siRNA prevented the α-chaconine-mediated inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators. In a sepsis model, pretreatment with α-chaconine reduced the LPS-induced lethality and the mRNA and production levels of pro-inflammatory mediators by inhibiting c-Jun activation. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of α-chaconine are associated with the suppression of AP-1, and support its possible therapeutic role for the treatment of sepsis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It was primarily reported to have toxic effects in humans. However, there is a growing body of literature demonstrating in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity of α-solanine. Most of these studies have shown activation of apoptosis as the underlying mechanism in antitumor activity of α-solanine. In this study, we report α-solanine as a potential inducer of autophagy, which may act synergistically or in parallel with apoptosis to exert its cytotoxic effect. Induction of autophagy was demonstrated by several assays including electron microscopy, immunoblotting of autophagy markers and immunofluorescence for LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 (MAP1) light chain-3) puncta. α-Solanine-induced autophagic flux was demonstrated by additionally enhanced--turnover of LC3-II and--accumulation of LC3-specific puncta after co-incubation of cells with either of the autophagolysosome inhibitors--chloroquine and--bafilomycin A1. We also demonstrated α-solanine-induced oxidative damage in regulating autophagy where pre-incubation of cells with reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger resulted in suppression of CM-H2DCFDA (5 (and 6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester) fluorescence as well as decrease in LC3-II turnover. α-Solanine treatment caused an increase in the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins (BiP, activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), X-box-binding protein 1, PERK, inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endonuclease 1, ATF4 and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-homologous protein) suggesting activation of unfolded protein response pathway. Moreover, we found downregulation of phosphorylated Akt (Thr308 and Ser473), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; Ser2448 and Ser2481) and 4E-BP1 (Thr37/46) by α-solanine implying suppression of the Akt/mTOR pathway. Collectively, our results signify that α-solanine induces autophagy to exert anti-proliferative activity by triggering ER stress and inhibiting Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18097538>Balanitin-6 and -7: diosgenyl saponins isolated from Balanites aegyptiaca Del. display significant anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>Balanites aegyptiaca is a widely distributed African plant of medicinal interest containing a number of cytotoxic and cytostatic compounds. The studies reported here have attempted to further characterize the anti-cancer activity of a mixture of steroidal saponins: balanitin-6 (28%) and balanitin-7 (72%) isolated from Balanites aegyptiaca kernels. The balanitin-6 and -7 mixture (henceforth referred to as bal6/7) has demonstrated appreciable anti-cancer effects in human cancer cell lines in vitro. Bal6/7 displayed higher anti-proliferative activity than etoposide and oxaliplatin, although the mixture was appreciably less active than SN38 and markedly less active than taxol. Bal6/7 demonstrated highest activity against A549 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (IC(50), 0.3 microM) and U373 glioblastoma (IC(50), 0.5 microM) cell lines. The current study has further indicated that bal6/7 is more a cytotoxic compound than a cytostatic one. However, Bal6/7 does not appear to mediate its anti-proliferative effects by inducing apoptotic cell death. Computer-assisted cellular imaging has revealed that bal6/7 does not induce detergent-like effects in A549 NSCLC and U373 glioblastoma unlike certain saponins. Furthermore there is indication that its in vitro anti-cancer activities result at least partly from depletion of [ATP]i, leading in turn to major disorganization of actin cytoskeleton, ultimately resulting in the impairment of cancer cell proliferation and migration. In contrast to a number of natural products acting as anti-cancer agents, bal6/7 does not induce an increase in intra-cellular reactive  species. In vivo, bal6/7 increased the survival time of mice bearing murine L1210 leukemia grafts to the same extent reported for vincristine. These preliminary in vivo data suggest that it may be possible to generate novel hemi-synthetic derivatives of balanitin-6 and -7 with potentially improved in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer activity and reduced in vivo toxicity, thus markedly improving the therapeutic ratio.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24956825>[Effect and mechanism of polyphyllin I on human cervical cancer cell HeLa in vitro].</a></h2><p>To study the effect and mechanism of polyphyllin I on human cervical cancer cell HeLa.The cell growth and proliferation effect of Polyphyllin I on HeLa cells were measured by MTT assay; Hoechst 33258 fluorescent staining was used to record changes in cell morphology and morphological changes in mitochondria of Polyphyllin I before and after treatment on He La cells.

The product was said to be obtained from adrenal glands collected in a huge amount in Argentina and transported by U-boats to Germany. The U. S. and the U. K. exerted their war efforts by setting up urgent research projects to produce similar products. The war ended in 1945, however, before the goal was achieved. The German rumor turned out to be groundless. Cortisone acquired fame in 1949 as "a miracle drug" for the relief of rheumatic pain. Its therapeutic discovery was an outcome of the untenable assumption that rheumatoid arthritis patients must have suffered from adrenal insufficiency and hormone deficiency. The war efforts have led to successful syntheses of cortisone after the war, and its industrial production has reduced its cost drastically from $200.00 per gram in 1949 to $10.00 in 1951. To overcome the cumbersome synthetic routes for cortisone, natural product sources were sought as possible starting materials, but without much success. A microbiological transformation of steroidal compounds was developed in 1952 to introduce an  function into the molecular position 11 by a microorganism found at a window of a laboratory. The fermentation process required progesterone which found its timely supply in Mexico. The cost of progesterone went down from $2.00 per gram to $0.15 and that of cortisone further from $10.00 to $3.50 in 1955. An ample supply of cortisone at an affordable price was admirably achieved by the combination of progesterone derived from  of the Mexican yam and a microbiological oxidation process developed by a chance discovery of suitable organisms.

In the present study, in vivo test of Dox-induced nephrotoxicity in rats and in vitro model in NRK-52E cells were developed. The results showed that dioscin significantly attenuated cell injury, obviously reduced ROS level in vitro, and markedly decreased the levels of BUN, Cr, MDA, and notably increased the levels of SOD, GSH and GSH-Px in rats. Mechanistic studies showed that dioscin significantly increased the levels of p-AMPKα, Nrf2, HO-1 and GST by activation of FXR against oxidative stress. In addition, dioscin suppressed the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and HMGB1, and subsequently decreased the mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α against inflammation. These results were further validated by knockdown of FXR using siRNA silencing, and abrogation of FXR using NDB (a FXR inhibitor) in NRK-52E cells, and the results suggested that the protective effect of dioscin against Dox- induced nephrotoxicity via adjusting FXR-mediated signal to suppress oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, molecular docking assay showed that dioscin directly targeted with FXR through competing with Helix12 (H12) by hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effect and electrostatic interactions. In a word, our data showed that dioscin is a novel and potent FXR agonist to suppress inflammation and oxidative stress against Dox-induced nephrotoxicity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Bioinformatic analysis shows potential interactions between MPD and Mul1. This study aims to explore whether MPD could protect rat brain against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury through regulation of Mul1/ superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) pathway. The SD rat brains were subjected to 2 h of ischemia following by 24 h of reperfusion, which showed I/R injury (increase in neurological deficit score and infarct volume), up-regulation of Mul1 and down regulation of SOD2, these phenomena were attenuated by MPD treatment (3 or 10 mg/kg, i.g.). Consistently, in cultured HT22 cells, hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) treatment induced cellular injury (apoptosis and LDH release) concomitant with up-regulation of Mul1 and down regulation of SOD2, these phenomena were blocked in the presence of MPD (5 μM). Knockdown of Mul1 could also decrease SOD2 protein levels in HT22 cells accompanied by alleviation of H/R injury (reduction of apoptosis and LDH release). In agreement with the change of SOD2, reactive oxygen species generation was increased in H/R-treated HT22 cells while decreased in the presence of MPD. Based on these observations, we conclude that upregulation of Mul1 in rat brain contributes to cerebral I/R injury via suppression of SOD2 and that MPD protects rat brain from I/R injury through a mechanism involving regulation of Mul1/SOD2 pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, its activity on colorectal cancer is still unknown. The present work showed that dioscin significantly inhibited cell proliferation on human HCT-116 colon cancer cells, and affected Ca(2+) release and ROS generation. The content of nitric oxide (NO) and its producer inducible NO synthase (iNOS) associated with DNA damage and aberrant cell signaling were assayed using the kits. DNA damage and cell apoptosis caused by dioscin were also analyzed through single-cell gel electrophoresis and in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assays. The results showed that dioscin increased the levels of NO and inducible NO synthase. The comet length in dioscin-treated groups was much longer than that of the control group, and the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling positive cells (apoptotic cells) was significantly increased by the compound (p < 0.01). Furthermore, dioscin caused mitochondrial damage and G2/M cell cycle arrest through transmission electron microscopy and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. To study the cytotoxic mechanism of dioscin, an iTRAQ-based proteomics approach was used. There were 288 significantly different proteins expressed in response to dioscin, which were connected with each other and were involved in different Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Then, some differentially expressed proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, Wnt, p53, and calcium signaling pathways were validated by Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR assays.

The key steps in the synthetic pathway are the incorporation of an amino moiety and its further transformation into thio- and selenoureas, and also a click chemistry reaction involving a propargyl residue and an azido moiety to afford carbohydrate-derived 1,2,3-triazoles; subsequent BF3-promoted acetolysis of the spiranic moiety afforded the corresponding 22-oxocholestanic structure. The N-phenyl selenourea, an hitherto unknown steroidal derivative, turned out to be a potent ROS scavenger, in particular against free radicals (EC50 = 29.47 ± 2.33 μM, DPPH method), and as a glutathione peroxidase mimic in the elimination of H2O2 (t1/2 = 4.8 min, 1% molar ratio). 22-Oxocholestane structures bearing a C-3 azido, propargyl, thioureido, and particularly selenoureido moiety behaved as strong antiproliferative agents against HeLa cells (IC50 1.87-11.80 μM). N-phenyl selenourea also exhibited IC50 values lower than 6.50 μM for MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and HepG2 cancer cells; apoptosis was found to be involved in its mode of action.

In vitro studies showed that HIV proteins, gp120 and Tat, Tat + morphine but not tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), caused increased neurotoxicity in human neuronal cultures with ApoE4 allele. Microarray analysis showed a differential alteration of transcripts involved in energy metabolism in cultures of ApoE3 and 4 neurons upon treatment with Tat + morphine. This was confirmed using assays of mitochondrial function and exposure of the neurons to Tat + morphine. Using this in vitro model, we screened a number of novel antioxidants and found that only L-deprenyl and  protected against the neurotoxicity of Tat + morphine. Furthermore, Tat-induced oxidative stress impaired morphine metabolism which could also be prevented by .

The effects of DSG on , glucose uptake and mitochondrial function were evaluated. Furthermore, the mechanism of DSG on oxidative stress,  consumption and  synthesis in LO2 cells was investigated.The results indicated that palmitic acid induced obvious  accumulation in LO2 cells and that DSG treatment significantly reduced the intracellular  content. DSG treatment upregulated expression of lipolysis proteins, including phospho-AMP activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), phospho-acetyl-coA carboxylase (p-ACC) and carnitine acyl transferase 1A (CPT-1A), and inhibited expression of  synthesis-related proteins, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). Additionally, DSG-treated cells displayed a marked improvement in mitochondrial function, with less production of reactive oxygen species and a higher mitochondrial membrane potential compared with the model group.This study suggests that DSG can reduce intracellular  accumulation in LO2 cells and that the underlying mechanism may be related to the improving oxidative stress, increasing fatty acid β-oxidation and decreasing  synthesis.

However, its detailed molecular mechanisms have not been clearly clarified.In this study, we demonstrate that dioscin induces apoptosis in cancer cells through the induction of oxidative stress. Treatment with cancer cells in vitro with dioscin resulted in rapid generation of reactive  species (ROS) and the induction of mitochondrial pathway apoptosis in human esophageal cancer cell line Kyse510. Inhibition of oxidative stress by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine blocked the induction of apoptosis by dioscin, indicating that ROS generation is the primary mechanism responsible for the proapoptotic activity of dioscin. Proteomic analysis and protein gel blotting further revealed peroxiredoxins 1 and 6 (PRDX 1 and 6), which are implicated in ROS metabolism and apoptosis, were associated with the anticancer effects of dioscin. Meanwhile, overexpression of PRDX 1 and 6 significantly blocked the elevated ROS and apoptosis induced by dioscin.

Among the treatment groups, M + D produced the most prominent effects. In conclusion, our data showed for the first time that Mor, Dio, and M + D prevented high glucose (HG)-induced myocardial injury by reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis in rat cardiomyocytes. Among all the groups, M + D produced the strongest effect, while Mor and Dio produced weaker effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29483824>Dioscin overcome TKI resistance in EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma cells via down-regulation of tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 expression.</a></h2><p>Resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) results in tumor relapse and poor prognosis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. TKI resistance caused by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations at T790M and c-Met amplification occurs through persistent activation of the MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. We therefore expected that dual inhibitors of both signaling pathways could overcome TKI resistance in lung adenocarcinoma. Here, dioscin was selected from a product library of Chinese naturally occurring compounds and overcame TKI resistance in EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma cells. Mechanistically, dioscin may down-regulate the expression of SH2 domain-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP2) at the transcription level by increasing p53 binding to the SHP2 promoter due to reactive  species (ROS). Simultaneous inhibition of MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT activation via decreased SHP2 expression and its interaction with GAB1 may be responsible for dioscin-mediated TKI sensitivity. A higher unfavorable response to TKI therapy occurred more commonly in patients with high SHP2 mRNA expression than in patients with low SHP2 mRNA expression. Therefore, we suggest that dioscin may act as a dual inhibitor of the MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways to overcome TKI resistance via dysregulation of SHP2 expression in lung adenocarcinoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26931732>α-Solanine Isolated From Solanum Tuberosum L. cv Jayoung Abrogates LPS-Induced Inflammatory Responses Via NF-κB Inactivation in RAW 264.7 Macrophages and Endotoxin-Induced Shock Model in Mice.</a></h2><p>α-Solanine, a trisaccharide glycoalkaloid, has been reported to possess anti-cancer effects. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of α-solanine isolated from "Jayoung" a dark purple-fleshed potato by examining its in vitro inhibitory effects on inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages and its in vivo effects on LPS-induced septic shock in a mouse model. α-Solanine suppressed the expression of iNOS and COX-2 both at protein and mRNA levels and consequently inhibited nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ) production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages. α-Solanine also reduced the production and mRNA expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) induced by LPS. Furthermore, molecular mechanism studies indicated that α-solanine inhibited LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) by reducing nuclear translocation of p65, degradation of inhibitory κBα (IκBα), and phosphorylation of IκB kinaseα/β (IKKα/β). In an in vivo experiment of LPS-induced endotoxemia, treatment with α-solanine suppressed mRNA expressions of iNOS, COX-2, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β, and the activation of NF-κB in liver. Importantly, α-solanine increased the survival rate of mice in LPS-induced endotoxemia and polymicrobial sepsis models. Taken together, our data suggest that the α-solanine may be a promising therapeutic against inflammatory diseases by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. J. Cell.

This study investigated the anti-Saprolegnia activity of a total of 108 plants on Saprolegnia parasitica in vitro and Dioscorea collettii was selected for further studies. By loading on an open silica gel column and eluting with petroleum ether-ethyl acetate-methanol, dioscin (C45H72O16) was isolated from D. collettii. Saprolegnia parasitica growth was inhibited significantly when dioscin concentration was more than 2.0 mg L(-1). When compared with formalin and hydrogen peroxide, dioscin showed a higher inhibitory effect. As potential inhibition mechanisms, dioscin could cause the S. parasitica mycelium morphologic damage, dense folds, or disheveled protuberances observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy and the influx of Propidium iodide. The structural changes in the treated mycelium were indicative of an efficient anti-Saprolegnia activity of dioscin. The oxidative stress results showed that dioscin also accumulated reactive oxygen species excessively and increased total antioxidant and superoxide dismutase activity. These situations could render S. parasitica more vulnerable to oxidative damage. Additionally, when dioscin concentration was less than 2.0 mg L(-1), the survival rate of embryos was more than 70%. Therefore, the use of dioscin could be a viable way of preventing and controlling saprolegniasis.© FEMS 2015. All rights reserved.

Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms by which MPD induced apoptosis in MG-63 cells. The data showed that MPD significantly suppressed cell growth (cell viabilities: 22.5 ± 1.9% for 8 μM MPD versus 100 ± 1.4% for control, P < 0.01) and enhanced cell apoptosis. The exposure to MPD resulted in a significant induction of reactive oxygen species, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 (P < 0.01, all cases). Furthermore, treatment with MPD increased the levels of phosphorylated JNK and p38 MAPK and markedly decreased the levels of phosphorylated ERK in MG-63 cells. Co-administration of the JNK-specific antagonist, the p38-specific antagonist, or the caspase antagonist (P < 0.05, all cases) has reversed the apoptotic effects in MPD treatment. We also found that exposure to MPD resulted in a significant reduction in the protein level of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, survivin, and XIAP (P < 0.05, all cases). In conclusion, our results indicate that MPD induces apoptosis of human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells, at least in part, by caspase-dependent and MAPK signaling pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12229321>Contraceptives and other steroid drugs: their production from steroidal sapogenins.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23950101>Dioscin prevents the mitochondrial apoptosis and attenuates oxidative stress in cardiac H9c2 cells.</a></h2><p>To determine if dioscin protects cardiac cells from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by preventing apoptosis.Cardiac H9c2 cells were subjected to simulated I/R. Cell viability was evaluated by the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) colorimetry assay. Reactive  species (ROS) were detected with dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF). Apoptosis was evaluated with flow cytometric assay. Rhodamine 123 (Rho123) was used to measure mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). ELISA was used to detect cytochrome c (Cyt-c) release from mitochondria to the cytosol. Bax and Bcl-2 mRNA expressions were measured with RT-PCR.Dioscin reduced cell death and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in cells subjected to I/R. I/R induced apoptosis and cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol and this was prevented by dioscin. In support, dioscin decreased Bax but increased Bcl-2 mRNA expression. Dioscin prevented I/R induced dissipation of ΔΨm. Finally, dioscin increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression but reduced intracellular ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels.Dioscin protects H9c2 cells from H/R injury by modulating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway through attenuation of oxidative stress.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28954389> a phytosterol substitute for cholesterol, prolongs the lifespan and mitigates glucose toxicity via DAF-16/FOXO and GST-4 in Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h2><p>Caenorhabditis elegans is a sterol auxotroph requires minute amount of exogenous sterol for their growth and development. To culture the C. elegans, cholesterol was given as sterol molecule to maintain the optimum survival of worms.  (DG), a plant derived steroidal saponin, structurally similar to cholesterol has been used as a precursor for the synthesis of steroidal hormones. In this study, worms were cultured with cholesterol (Cho) and cholesterol-free (Cho) medium with DG (5, 10 and 50μg/mL) at 20°C. It was observed that worms cultured in (Cho) exhibits late egg production, reduced  level and short lifespan, while addition of DG overcomes all defective facts. Combinations of both cholesterol and DG further extend the lifespan (20.8%), hinder  level and resistance to oxidative, thermal and high glucose stress. The intracellular ROS quantification was done by flouroscenic probe H2DCF-DA and confirmed that DG had significantly reduced ROS level (35.85%). Increased lifespan of worms were observed in the medium treated with DG which activates the nuclear translocation of DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, followed by downstream antioxidant gene sod-3 as evidenced by GFP tagged strain. The expression of Phase II detoxification enzyme GST-4 significantly (p<0.001) increased in transgenic worms exposed to DG with 50mM glucose, and storage of  in intestinal cells was reduced in N2 wild type worms. Genetic requirement of DG induced longevity was studied with different mutant strains of mev-1, daf-16, skn-1, and eat-2. These studies have proved that DG is a sterol source to worms and modulate the DAF-16, SOD-3 and GST-4 expression levels to extend the lifespan of worms. The present study has also highlighted the use of phytosterols as an alternative to cholesterol.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The present work aimed to investigate the effects and potential mechanisms of dioscin in preventing LPS-induced kidney injury. In vivo injury was induced in rats and mice with an intraperitoneal injection of LPS (10mg/kg), and in vitro studies were performed on NRK-52E and HK-2 cells challenged with LPS (0.5μg/ml). Our results indicated that dioscin significantly protected against renal damage by decreasing blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels and reversing oxidative stress. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that dioscin markedly up- regulated the level of the microRNA let-7i, resulting in significant inhibition of TLR4 expression. Dioscin significantly down-regulated the levels of MyD88, NOX1 and cleaved caspase-8/3; inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-κB; inhibited PI3K and Akt phosphorylation; increased the levels of SOD2; and decreased the mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, MIP-1α, Fas and FasL. In vitro, transfection of microRNA let-7i inhibitor and TLR4 DNA were applied, and the results further confirmed the nephroprotective effect of dioscin in suppressing TLR4/MyD88 signaling and subsequently inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Furthermore, the abrogation of cellular MyD88 expression by ST2825 eliminated the inhibitory effect of dioscin on the levels of nuclear NF-κB, cleaved caspase-3, SOD2 and ROS. These data indicated that dioscin exerted a nephroprotective effect against LPS-induced inflammatory renal injury by adjusting the microRNA let-7i/TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathway, which provided novel insights into the mechanisms of this therapeutic candidate for the treatment of inflammatory kidney injury.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
