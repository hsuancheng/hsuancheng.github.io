Here we show that elaidic  (EA), the most abundant TFA in diet, alters the electrophysiological properties of voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) of . Purified bovine brain VDAC, when incorporated in the planar lipid bilayer (PLB) composed of 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3 phosphatidyl choline (DPhPC) and EA in a 9 to 1 ratio (wt/wt), exhibited complete closing events at different voltages. The closing events were observed at even -10 mV, a voltage at which VDAC usually remains fully open all the time. Additionally, the voltage sensitivity of VDAC was lost in presence of EA; the channel conductance did not decrease with increasing voltages. In identical experimental conditions, membrane containing  (OA), the cis isomer of EA did not produce any such effect. We propose that EA possibly exerts its adverse effect by modulating VDAC.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

To investigate whether linoleic  could protect against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced cell death, rat RIN-m5F cells were exposed to STZ. SL and SO groups consisted of cells treated with STZ and then LA or  (OA) respectively. STZ treatment decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential in the STZ, SO, and SL groups. Cells of the SL group had more intact . Increased mRNA expression of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA), as well as of the mitochondrial biogenesis regulators peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), and mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam), were found in the LA group. The insulin content was significantly decreased in all three groups. These results suggest that the effects of LA on cell viability after STZ damage occur through maintenance of mitochondrial structure and increased mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22223579>Oleate metabolism in pig enterocytes is characterized by an increased oxidation rate in the presence of a high esterification rate within two days after birth.</a></h2><p>Oleate (OLE) is the principle fatty  (FA) in mammalian colostrum, but its role in the energy supply in enterocytes after birth remains unknown. We investigated the metabolic fate of OLE in pig enterocytes at birth (d0) and after 2 d of suckling (d2). Cellular TG and phospholipids (PL) and FA composition were analyzed. Metabolic end-products of [1-¹⁴C]OLE were measured in enterocyte incubations. We characterized intestinal carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), the key enzyme of mitochondrial FA oxidation. The TG content was 6.6-fold higher in enterocytes from pigs on d 2 than in those obtained on d 0, whereas the PL content did not differ. The level of OLE in TG and PL increased from 15 and 11% of total FA, respectively, in enterocytes from newborn piglets to 30 and 17%, respectively, in those from d2 pigs. The capacity for OLE utilization was 2.8-fold greater in d2 than in d0 pig enterocytes. The oxidation and esterification rates were enhanced in enterocytes from piglets on d 2 compared to those obtained on d 0, by 4- and 2.6-fold, respectively. The predominant OLE fate was the esterification pathway, representing >85% of OLE metabolized in both groups. The limited OLE oxidation observed at d 2 may result from the presence of a highly malonyl-CoA-sensitive CPT1A, because the half maximal inhibitory concentration for malonyl-CoA was 162 ± 25 nmol/L. This study highlighted the high esterification capacity for OLE in the newborn pig intestine, which may preserve this major colostrum FA for delivery to other tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21697633>Dietary taurine reduces hepatic secretion of cholesteryl ester and enhances fatty  oxidation in rats fed a high-cholesterol diet.</a></h2><p>We investigated the fate of exogenous fatty  in connection with decreased hepatic accumulation and secretion of cholesteryl esters in rats fed diets containing taurine. Providing taurine as 5% of the diet for 14 d significantly decreased concentrations of cholesterol, especially cholesteryl esters in both serum and liver. Ketone body production and incorporation of exogenous [1-(14)C]oleate into ketone bodies in liver perfusate were consistently higher during a 4-h perfusion period in taurine-fed rats than in control rats. The elevation was accompanied by increased activity of liver mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase, a rate-limiting enzyme for fatty  oxidation. Dietary taurine significantly reduced hepatic secretion of cholesteryl ester and decreased incorporation of exogenous  substrate into this lipid molecule. Further, the extent of reduction in hepatic secretion of cholesteryl ester was closely related to its diminished accumulation in the liver. The conversion pattern of exogenous [1-(14)C] substrate suggested a decreased esterification-to-oxidation ratio in the taurine group compared with the control. These results suggest that taurine-induced reduction in hepatic accumulation of cholesteryl ester was associated with reduced hepatic secretion of this lipid molecule, and was inversely related to enhanced ketone body production and fatty  oxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28229635>Oral administration of fumonisin B and T-2 individually and in combination affects hepatic total and mitochondrial membrane lipid profile of rabbits.</a></h2><p>Weaned rabbits were fed diets contaminated with 2 mg/kg diet T-2 toxin alone, or 10 mg/kg diet fumonisin B (FB) alone, and both toxins in combination (2 + 10 mg/kg, respectively) compared to a toxin-free control diet. Samplings were performed after 4 weeks (blood and liver). Bodyweight of T-2-fed group was lower after 4 weeks; the liver weight was increased dramatically (threefold of control). Liver total phospholipids (PLs) provided slight alterations in the fatty  (FA) composition; all three toxin-treated groups showed a decrease in palmitoleic  (C16:1 n7) proportion. In the liver mitochondrial PL FA composition, margaric  (C17:0) proportion decreased in the separated toxin treatments compared to the combined setting.  (C18:1 n9) proportion was increased and arachidonic  (C20:4 n6) was decreased in the FB-treated group, while docosapentaenoic  (C22:5 n3) was decreased in the separated treatments. The total monounsaturation was significantly higher in the FB group's mitochondrial PL FA profile. After 4 weeks, all toxin treatments decreased the blood plasma reduced glutathione and glutathione peroxidase activity, and FB increased the plasma sphinganine/sphingosine ratio. Both mycotoxins seem to cross the hepatocellular and the hepatic mitochondrial membrane, without drastic membrane disruption, as assessed from the PL FA composition, but inducing detectable lipid peroxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769284>Electrophilic nitro- reverses obesity-induced hepatic steatosis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is linked to obesity and insulin resistance and is the most prevalent chronic liver disease. During the development of obesity and NAFLD,  adapt to the increased lipid load in hepatocytes by increasing the rate of fatty  oxidation. In concert with this, reactive species (RS) generation is increased, damaging hepatocytes and inducing inflammation. Hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction is central to the pathogenesis of NAFLD via undefined mechanisms. There are no FDA approved treatments for NAFLD other than weight loss and management of glucose tolerance. Electrophilic nitro- (NO-OA) displays anti-inflammatory and antioxidant signaling actions, thus mitochondrial dysfunction, RS production and inflammatory responses to NO-OA and the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone were evaluated in a murine model of insulin resistance and NAFLD. Mice on HFD for 20 wk displayed increased adiposity, insulin resistance and hepatic lipid accumulation (steatosis) compared to mice on normal chow (NC). The HFD mice had mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by lower hepatic mitochondrial complex I, IV and V activity compared to mice on NC. Treatment with NO-OA or rosiglitazone for the last 42 days (out of 20 wk) abrogated HFD-mediated decreases in hepatic mitochondrial complex I, IV and V activity. Notably, NO-OA treatment normalized hepatic triglyceride levels and significantly reversed hepatic steatosis. Despite the improved glucose tolerance observed upon rosiglitazone treatment, liver weight and hepatic triglycerides were significantly increased over vehicle-treated HFD mice. These observations support that the pleiotropic signaling actions of electrophilic fatty acids limit the complex hepatic and systemic pathogenic responses instigated by obesity, without the adverse effects of thiazolidinedione drugs such as rosiglitazone.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We investigated whether different oils and fatty acids alone were able to decrease oxidative stress induced on corneal cells.In our in vivo study, rats were fed with marine oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) or refined olive oil during 28 days. At the end of the protocol, corneas were analysed for their fatty acids composition to study the incorporation of fatty acids in cell membranes. In our in vitro study, a human corneal cell line was incubated with marine oils or refined olive oil and subjected to oxidative stress (tBHP 50 muM, 1 hour). Effects on reactive oxygen species generation,  and caveolin-1 expression were studied using microcytofluorometry, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.Our results indicate that dietary oils changed the fatty acids composition of corneal cell membranes. According to our results, PUFA-rich oils and refined olive oil (free of antioxidants) blocked reactive oxygen species production. , the major fatty  of olive oil, also decreased oxidative stress. Moreover,  modified caveolin-1 expression. Antioxidant properties of  could be due to disruption of membrane microdomains such as caveolae., a potential potent modulator of oxidative stress, could be added to PUFA-rich oils to prevent oxidative stress-linked corneal pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30450126>Changes in  convey  tolerance in .</a></h2><p>The yeast  plays an essential role in the fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Weak organic acids in lignocellulosic hydrolysate can hamper the use of this renewable resource for fuel and chemical production. Plasma-membrane remodeling has recently been found to be involved in acquiring tolerance to organic acids, but the mechanisms responsible remain largely unknown. Therefore, it is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms of  tolerance of  for developing robust industrial strains.We have performed a comparative analysis of lipids and fatty acids in  grown in the presence of four different weak acids. The general response of the yeast to  stress was found to be the accumulation of triacylglycerols and the degradation of steryl esters. In addition, a decrease in phosphatidic , phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine, and an increase in phosphatidylinositol were observed. Loss of cardiolipin in the mitochondria membrane may be responsible for the dysfunction of mitochondria and the dramatic decrease in the rate of respiration of  under  stress. Interestingly, the accumulation of ergosterol was found to be a protective mechanism of yeast exposed to organic acids, and the  gene in ergosterol biosynthesis played a key in ergosterol-mediated  tolerance, as perturbing the expression of this gene caused rapid loss of viability. Interestingly, overexpressing  resulted in the increased levels of  (18:1n-9) and an increase in the unsaturation index of fatty acids in the plasma membrane, resulting in higher tolerance to acetic, formic and levulinic , while this change was found to be detrimental to cells exposed to lipophilic cinnamic .Comparison of  profiles revealed different remodeling of lipids, FAs and the unsaturation index of the FAs in the cell membrane in response of  to acetic, formic, levulinic and cinnamic , depending on the properties of the .

Previous studies showed that subcellular DFCP1 proteins display multi-organelle localization, including in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus and . However, its localization and function on lipid droplets (LDs) remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that DFCP1 localizes to the LD upon  incubation. The ER-targeted domain of DFCP1 is indispensable for its LD localization, which is further enhanced by double FYVE domains. Inhibition of PI3P binding at the FYVE domain through wortmannin treatment or double mutation at C654S and C770S have no effect on DFCP1's LD localization. These show that the mechanisms for DFCP1 targeting the omegasome and LDs are different. DFCP1 deficiency in MEF cells causes an increase in LD number and reduces LD size. Interestingly, DFCP1 interacts with GTP-bound Rab18, an LD-associated protein. Taken together, our work demonstrates the dynamic localization of DFCP1 is regulated by nutritional status in response to cellular metabolism.© 2019 International Federation for Cell Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31529902>[The insulin initiates "kinetic perfection" of biologic function of locomotion.

Six healthy sedentary (maximal oxygen uptake (VO) ≤ 46 ml/kg/min) and six healthy athletic (VO > 60 ml/kg/min) young men were included. Myoblasts were cultured and differentiated to myotubes from satellite cells isolated from biopsy of musculus vastus lateralis.

The relative effectiveness and mechanisms of different polyphenols however is mostly unknown.In a model of steatosis using HepG2 hepatocytes, we evaluated the protective effects of different classes of polyphenols and the contributing mechanisms. The treatment of the cells with  increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), decreased expression of uncoupling protein 2, and decreased mitochondrial content and markers of biogenesis. The treatment with 1-10 μM polyphenols (resveratrol, quercetin, catechin, cyanidin, kuromanin, and berberine), as well as phenolic degradation products (caffeic , protocatechuic , and 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzaldehyde), all protected by more than 50% against the  induced increase in ROS. In other mechanisms involved, the polyphenols except anthocyanins strongly prevented or reversed the effect on mitochondrial content/biogenesis, increased expression of manganese superoxide dismutase, and prevented the large increase in TNF-α expression. Most polyphenols also prevented the decrease in uncoupling protein 2. The anthocyanins were unique in decreasing ROS generation without inducing mitochondrial biogenesis or manganese superoxide dismutase expression.While different polyphenols similarly decreased cellular ROS in this model of steatosis, they differed in their ability to suppress TNF-α expression and induce mitochondrial biogenesis and content.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

There was assessment, therefore, of the capacity of individual fatty acids bound to fatty  free BSA to improve sperm survival at 6 °C because oxidative stress and lipid degradation are prominent detrimental factors. Different effects of the fatty acids were observed. Supplementation with naturally occurring fatty acids (linolenic, linoleic, , palmitoleic ), which may become metabolically incorporated into sperm lipids, increased the number of motile and progressively motile sperm after 2 days of storage during a thermo-resistance test (5 h at 38 °C) to that of control samples preserved at 17 °C in pure Beltsville Thawing Solution. With the exception of linolenic , all naturally occurring fatty acids enhanced the number of sperm with active  after 3 days of storage. Palmitoleic  was the most effective supplement with effects already present when sperm were re-warmed for 30 min after 2 and 7 days of storage. The non-endogenous, non-integrated timnodonic  (20:5) had no effect on sperm variables. Because the application of individual fatty acids attached to BSA had differing effects in preserving boar sperm at 6 °C, the use of combinations of fatty acids could be more efficacious than with use of natural lipid supplements for low temperature preservation of sperm.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It is characterized by distinct changes in the morphology of the dying cell that are orchestrated by a series of discrete biochemical events. Although there is evidence of primitive forms of programmed cell death also in prokaryotes, no information is available to suggest that prokaryotic death displays mechanistic similarities to the highly regulated programmed death of eukaryotic cells. In this study we compared the characteristics of tumor and bacterial cell death induced by HAMLET, a human milk complex of alpha-lactalbumin and .We show that HAMLET-treated bacteria undergo cell death with mechanistic and morphologic similarities to apoptotic death of tumor cells. In Jurkat cells and Streptococcus pneumoniae death was accompanied by apoptosis-like morphology such as cell shrinkage, DNA condensation, and DNA degradation into high molecular weight fragments of similar sizes, detected by field inverse gel electrophoresis. HAMLET was internalized into tumor cells and associated with , causing a rapid depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and bound to and induced depolarization of the pneumococcal membrane with similar kinetic and magnitude as in . Membrane depolarization in both systems required calcium transport, and both tumor cells and bacteria were found to require serine protease activity (but not caspase activity) to execute cell death.Our results suggest that many of the morphological changes and biochemical responses associated with apoptosis are present in prokaryotes.

This study investigates the effects of the saturated FA palmitate and unsaturated FA oleate on monocyte phenotype and function. Incubation of human U937 and THP-1 monocytes with palmitate for 24h increased cell surface expression of integrin CD11b and scavenger receptor CD36 in a concentration-dependent manner with some decrease in mitochondrial reducing capacity at high concentration (300 μM). Monocytes incubated with palmitate, but not oleate, showed increased uptake of oxidized LDL and increased adhesion to rat aortic endothelium, particularly at bifurcations. The palmitate-induced increase in CD11b and CD36 expression was associated with increased cellular C16 ceramide and sphingomyelin, loss of reduced glutathione, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased monocyte surface CD11b and CD36 was inhibited by fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of de novo ceramide synthesis, but not by the superoxide dismutase mimetic MnTBap. In contrast, MnTBap prevented the mitochondrial ROS increase and metabolic inhibition due to 300μM palmitate. This study demonstrates that in viable monocytes, palmitate but not oleate increases expression of surface CD11b and CD36. Palmitate increases monocyte adhesion to the aortic wall and promotes uptake of oxidized LDL and this involves de novo ceramide synthesis.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Since the phospholipid cardiolipin (CL) is required for function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, we examined the dynamics of CL synthesis in growing Hela cells immediately after and 12h post-fusion. Cells were transiently transfected with Mfn-2, to promote fusion, or Mfn-2 expressing an inactive GTPase for 24h and de novo CL biosynthesis was examined immediately after or 12h post-fusion. Western blot analysis confirmed elevated Mfn-2 expression and electron microscopic analysis revealed that Hela cell mitochondrial structure was normal immediately after and 12h post-fusion. Cells expressing Mfn-2 exhibited reduced CL de novo biosynthesis from [1,3-(3)H]glycerol immediately after fusion and this was due to a decrease in phosphatidylglycerol phosphate synthase (PGPS) activity and its mRNA expression. In contrast, 12h post-mitochondrial fusion cells expressing Mfn-2 exhibited increased CL de novo biosynthesis from [1,3-(3)H]glycerol and this was due to an increase in PGPS activity and its mRNA expression. Cells expressing Mfn-2 with an inactive GTPase activity did not exhibit alterations in CL de novo biosynthesis immediately after or 12h post-fusion. The Mfn-2 mediated alterations in CL de novo biosynthesis were not accompanied by alterations in CL or monolysoCL mass. [1-(14)C]Oleate incorporation into CL was elevated at 12h post-fusion indicating increased CL resynthesis. The reason for the increased CL resynthesis was an increased mRNA expression of tafazzin, a mitochondrial CL resynthesis enzyme. Ceramide-induced expression of PGPS in Hela cells or in CHO cells did not alter expression of Mfn-2 indicating that Mfn-2 expression is independent of altered CL synthesis mediated by elevated PGPS. In addition, Mfn-2 expression was not altered in Hela cells expressing phospholipid scramblase-3 or a disrupted scramblase indicating that proper CL localization within  is not essential for Mfn-2 expression. The results suggest that immediately post-mitochondrial fusion CL de novo biosynthesis is "slowed down" and then 12h post-fusion it is "upregulated".

AEA is hydrolyzed by fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH), an enzyme localized on the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast to most neuromodulators, the hydrophilic cytosol poses a diffusional barrier for the efficient delivery of AEA to its site of catabolism. Therefore, AEA likely traverses the cytosol with the assistance of an intracellular carrier that increases its solubility and rate of diffusion. To study this process, AEA uptake and hydrolysis were examined in COS-7 cells expressing FAAH restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum, , or the Golgi apparatus. AEA hydrolysis was detectable at the earliest measurable time point (3 seconds), suggesting that COS-7 cells, normally devoid of an endocannabinoid system, possess an efficient cytosolic trafficking mechanism for AEA. Three fatty  binding proteins (FABPs) known to be expressed in brain were examined as possible intracellular AEA carriers. AEA uptake and hydrolysis were significantly potentiated in N18TG2 neuroblastoma cells after overexpression of FABP5 or FABP7, but not FABP3. Similar results were observed in COS-7 cells stably expressing FAAH. Consistent with the roles of FABP as AEA carriers, administration of the competitive FABP ligand  or the selective non-lipid FABP inhibitor BMS309403 attenuated AEA uptake and hydrolysis by approximately 50% in N18TG2 and COS-7 cells. Taken together, FABPs represent the first proteins known to transport AEA from the plasma membrane to FAAH for inactivation and may therefore be novel pharmacological targets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19523918>Regulation of cardiolipin biosynthesis by fatty  transport protein-1 IN HEK 293 cells.</a></h2><p>Cardiolipin (CL) is a major phospholipid involved in energy metabolism mammalian  and fatty  transport protein-1 (FATP-1) is a fatty  transport protein that may regulate the intracellular level of fatty acyl-Coenzyme A's.

HEK-293 mock- and FATP-1 siRNA transfected cells or mock and FATP-1 expressing cells were incubated for 24 h with 0.1 mM  bound to albumin (1:1 molar ratio) then incubated for 24 h with 0.1 mM [1,3-(3)H]glycerol and radioactivity incorporated into CL determined. FATP-1 siRNA transfected cells exhibited reduced FATP-1 mRNA and increased incorporation of [1,3-(3)H]glycerol into CL (2-fold, p<0.05) compared to controls indicating elevation in de novo CL biosynthesis. The reason for this was an increase in [1,3-(3)H]glycerol uptake and increase in activity and mRNA expression of the CL biosynthetic enzymes. In contrast, expression of FATP-1 resulted a reduction in incorporation of [1,3-(3)H]glycerol into CL (65%, p<0.05) indicating reduced CL synthesis.

Conversely, unsaturated fatty acids like docosahexaenoic  were proven to preserve muscle mass. However, it is not known if the most common unsaturated oleate will protect skeletal myotubes against palmitate-mediated atrophy, and its specific mechanism remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the effects of oleate on atrophy-related factors in palmitate-conditioned myotubes. Exposure of myotubes to palmitate, but not to oleate, led to an induction of fragmented nuclei, myotube loss, atrophy, and mitochondrial superoxide in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of oleate to myotubes attenuated production of palmitate-induced mitochondrial superoxide in a dose-dependent manner. The treatment of oleate or MitoTEMPO to palmitate-conditioned myotubes led to inhibition of palmitate-induced mRNA expression of proinflammatory (TNF- and IL6), mitochondrial fission (Drp1 and Fis1), and atrophy markers (myostatin and atrogin1). In accordance with the gene expression data, our immunocytochemistry experiment demonstrated that oleate and MitoTEMPO prevented or attenuated palmitate-mediated myotube shrinkage. These results provide a mechanism indicating that oleate prevents palmitate-mediated atrophy via at least partial modulation of mitochondrial superoxide production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26330620>Small-Scale Purification of Peroxisomes for Analytical Applications.</a></h2><p>This protocol describes the isolation of peroxisomes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae by density gradient centrifugation using a sucrose, OptiPrep, or OptiPrep/sucrose gradient. -induced cells are first converted to spheroplasts using lyticase for cell wall digestion. Spheroplasts are homogenized, and nuclei and cell debris are removed by low-speed centrifugation to produce a postnuclear supernatant (PNS). Separation of the PNS by density gradient centrifugation is suitable for many analytical applications; however, to increase the yield of peroxisomes, further fractionation of the PNS is possible. Differential centrifugation of the PNS allows removal of the cytosol and other contaminating organelles, resulting in an organellar pellet (OP) enriched in peroxisomes and  that can be loaded onto the density gradient. Following density gradient centrifugation of the PNS or OP, fractions are collected from the bottom of the centrifuge tube. The distribution of organelles, including peroxisome peak fractions, is characterized by measurement of marker enzyme activity.© 2015 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25421740>Synergistic effects of zinc oxide nanoparticles and Fatty acids on toxicity to caco-2 cells.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids exposure may increase sensitivity of intestinal epithelial cells to cytotoxic effects of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs). This study evaluated the synergistic effects of ZnO NPs and palmitic  (PA) or free fatty acids (FFAs) mixture (/PA 2:1) on toxicity to human colon epithelial (Caco-2) cells. The ZnO NPs exposure concentration dependently induced cytotoxicity to Caco-2 cells showing as reduced proliferation and activity measured by 3 different assays. PA exposure induced cytotoxicity, and coexposure to ZnO NPs and PA showed the largest cytotoxic effects. The presence of FFAs mixture did not affect the ZnO NPs-induced cytotoxicity. Filtration of freshly prepared suspension of NPs through a 0.45-µm pore size membrane significantly reduced the cytotoxicity, indicating a role of concentration or size of particles in cytotoxic effects. The ZnO NPs and PA coexposure induced production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) but not intracellular ROS production, whereas FFAs mixture exposure did not induce mROS and inhibited intracellular ROS. Both ZnO NPs and fatty acids (PA and FFAs mixture) promoted lysosomal destabilization, which was not correlated with cytotoxicity. These results indicated that PA can enhance ZnO NPs-induced cytotoxicity probably by the augmentation of mROS production, whereas FFAs mixture did not affect ROS production. Synergistic effects between ZnO NPs and fatty acids may be important when considering NPs toxicity via oral exposure.© The Author(s) 2014.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29235334>Fatty acids composition of inner mitochondrial membrane of rat cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes during hypoxia-hypercapnia.</a></h2><p>We studied the influence of hypoxic-hypercapnic environment under the effect of hypothermia (artificial hibernation) on fatty acids spectrum of inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) lipids of rat cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes. Specific for cellular organelles redistribution of IMM fatty acids was determined. It led to the reduction of total amount of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and increase of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) in cardiomyocytes and to the increase of SFAs and decrease of UFAs in hepatocytes. The decrease in the content of  and increased content of arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids in IMM were shown.

Therefore, we have compared enzyme activities and rates of mitochondrial palmitate oxidation in muscles of wild-type (WT) and FAT/CD36 knockout (KO) mice, at rest and after muscle contraction. In WT and KO mice, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I, citrate synthase, and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities did not differ in subsarcolemmal (SS) and intermyofibrillar (IMF)  of WT and FAT/CD36 KO mice. Basal palmitate oxidation rates were lower (P < 0.05) in KO mice (SS -18%; IMF -13%). Muscle contraction increased fatty  oxidation (+18%) and mitochondrial FAT/CD36 protein (+16%) in WT IMF but not in WT SS, or in either mitochondrial subpopulation in KO mice. This revealed that the difference in IMF mitochondrial fatty  oxidation between WT and KO mice can be increased approximately 2.5-fold from 13% under basal conditions to 35% during muscle contraction. The FAT/CD36 inhibitor sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO), inhibited palmitate transport across the plasma membrane in WT, but not in KO mice. In contrast, SSO bound to mitochondrial membranes and reduced palmitate oxidation rates to a similar extent in both WT and KO  ( approximately 80%; P < 0.05). In addition, SSO reduced state III respiration with succinate as a substrate, without altering mitochondrial coupling (P/O ratios). Thus, while SSO inhibits FAT/CD36-mediated palmitate transport at the plasma membrane, SSO has undefined effects on . Nevertheless, the KO animals reveal that FAT/CD36 contributes to the regulation of mitochondrial fatty  oxidation, which is especially important for meeting the increased metabolic demands during muscle contraction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30099850>Heterogeneity of fatty   in breast cancer cells underlies differential sensitivity to palmitate-induced apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer (BrCa)  is geared toward biomass synthesis and maintenance of reductive capacity. Changes in glucose and glutamine  in BrCa have been widely reported, yet the contribution of fatty acids (FAs) in BrCa biology remains to be determined. We recently reported that adipocyte coculture alters MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell  and promotes proliferation and migration. Since adipocytes are FA-rich, and these FAs are transferred to BrCa cells, we sought to elucidate the FA  of BrCa cells and their response to FA-rich environments. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells incubated in serum-containing media supplemented with FAs accumulate extracellular FAs as intracellular triacylglycerols (TAG) in a dose-dependent manner, with MDA-MB-231 cells accumulating more TAG. The differences in TAG levels were a consequence of distinct differences in intracellular partitioning of FAs, and not due to differences in the rate of FA uptake. Specifically, MCF-7 cells preferentially partition FAs into mitochondrial oxidation, whereas MDA-MB-231 cells partition FAs into TAG synthesis. These differences in intracellular FA handling underpin differences in the sensitivity to palmitate-induced lipotoxicity, with MDA-MB-231 cells being highly sensitive, whereas MCF-7 cells are partially protected. The attenuation of palmitate-induced lipotoxicity in MCF-7 cells was reversed by inhibition of FA oxidation. Pretreatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with FAs increased TAG synthesis and reduced palmitate-induced apoptosis. Our results provide novel insight into the potential influences of obesity on BrCa biology, highlighting distinct differences in FA  in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and how -rich environments modulate these effects.© 2018 The Authors.

Here, we discuss direct conjugation of mitochondrial-targeting moieties to anticancer drugs, antioxidants and sensor molecules. Among them, the most widely applied mitochondrial targeting moiety is triphenylphosphonium (TPP), which is a delocalized cationic  that readily accumulates and penetrates through the mitochondrial membrane due to the highly negative mitochondrial membrane potential. Other moieties, including short peptides, dequalinium, guanidine, rhodamine, and F16, are also known to be promising mitochondrial targeting agents. Direct conjugation of mitochondrial targeting moieties to anticancer drugs, antioxidants and sensors results in increased cytotoxicity, anti-oxidizing activity and sensing activity, respectively, compared with their non-targeting counterparts, especially in drug-resistant cells. Although many mitochondria-targeted anticancer drug conjugates have been investigated  and , further clinical studies are still needed. On the other hand, several mitochondria-targeting antioxidants have been analyzed in clinical phases I, II and III trials, and one conjugate has been approved for treating eye disease in Russia.

Here we propose that HAMLET causes macroautophagy in tumor cells and that this contributes to their death. Cell death was accompanied by mitochondrial damage and a reduction in the level of active mTOR and HAMLET triggered extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization and the formation of double-membrane-enclosed vesicles typical of macroautophagy. In addition, HAMLET caused a change from uniform (LC3-I) to granular (LC3-II) staining in LC3-GFP-transfected cells reflecting LC3 translocation during macroautophagy, and this was blocked by the macroautophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. HAMLET also caused accumulation of LC3-II detected by Western blot when lysosomal degradation was inhibited suggesting that HAMLET caused an increase in autophagic flux. To determine if macroautophagy contributed to cell death, we used RNA interference against Beclin-1 and Atg5. Suppression of Beclin-1 and Atg5 improved the survival of HAMLET-treated tumor cells and inhibited the increase in granular LC3-GFP staining. The results show that HAMLET triggers macroautophagy in tumor cells and suggest that macroautophagy contributes to HAMLET-induced tumor cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28520897>Alpha-linolenic  protects the developmental capacity of bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes matured under lipotoxic conditions in vitro.</a></h2><p>Elevated concentrations of free fatty acids (FFAs), predominantly palmitic, stearic, and  acids (PSO), exert detrimental effects on oocyte developmental competence. This study examined the effects of omega-3 alpha-linolenic  (ALA) during in vitro oocyte maturation (IVM) in the presence of PSO on subsequent embryo development and quality, and the cellular mechanisms that might be involved. Bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were supplemented during IVM with ALA (50 μM), PSO (425 μM), or PSO+ALA. Compared with FFA-free controls (P < 0.05), PSO increased embryo fragmentation and decreased good quality embryos on day 2 postfertilization. Day 7 blastocyst rate was also reduced. Day 8 blastocysts had lower cell counts and higher apoptosis but normal metabolic profile. In the PSO group, cumulus cell (CC) expansion was inhibited with an increased CC apoptosis while COC metabolism was not affected. Mitochondrial inner membrane potential (MMP; JC-1 staining) was reduced in the CCs and oocytes. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) but not glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78, known as BiP; an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker) was upregulated in the CCs. Higher reactive oxygen species levels (DCHFDA staining) were detected in the oocytes. In contrast, adding ALA in the presence of PSO normalized embryo fragmentation, cleavage, blastocyst rates, and blastocyst quality compared to controls (P > 0.05). Combined treatment with ALA also reduced CC apoptosis, partially recovered CC expansion, abrogated the reduction in MMP in the CCs but not in the oocytes, and reduced BiP and HSP70 expression in CCs, compared with PSO only (P < 0.05). In conclusion, ALA supplementation protected oocyte developmental capacity under lipotoxic conditions mainly by protecting cumulus cell viability.© The Authors 2017.

The combination of obesity and type 2 diabetes, characterized as 'diabesity', is associated with elevated plasma free fatty acids (FFAs). Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of FFA-induced β-cell dysfunction. However, molecular mechanisms linking between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and FFA-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis are less clear. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that NOX2-derived ROS may play a critical role in dysfunction and apoptosis of β-cells induced by FFA. Our results show that palmitate and oleate (0.5 mmol/L, 48 h) induced JNK activation and AKT inhibition which resulted in decreased phosphorylation of FOXO1 following nuclear localization and the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of PDX-1, leading to the reducing of insulin and ultimately dysfunction of pancreatic NIT-1 cells. We also found that palmitate and oleate stimulated apoptosis of NIT-1 cells through p38MAPK, p53 and NF-κB pathway. More interestingly, our data suggest that suppression of NOX2 may restore FFA-induced dysfunction and apoptosis of NIT-1 cells. Our findings provide a new insight of the NOX2 as a potential new therapeutic target for preservation of β-cell mass and function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840368>[The nicotinic  as an inhibitor of lipolysis in the phylogenetically early visceral cells; insulin also blocks hydrolysis of triglycerides in the phylogenetically late adipocytes.]</a></h2><p>It is valid to consider effect of nicotinic  as an insulin-mimetic one. The uniformity of biologic effect of exogenous nicotinic  and endogenous insulin permits to become aware that a) the hypo-lipidemic activity of insulin, inhibition of lipolysis in phylogenetically late insulin-dependent adipocytes and decreasing of content of unesterified fatty acids in blood plasma are considered as a basis of hypoglycemic effect of insulin; b) nicotinic  similar to insulin blocks lipolysis too but in hormoneindependent visceral fatty cells. The counter-insular effect is manifested in vivo by exogenous and endogenous palmitic saturated fatty  by force of physical chemical characteristics. The biological role of insulin consists in regulation of metabolism of fatty acids mainly unesterified fatty acids and in absorption of glucose by all insulin-dependent cells. It is supposed that contractile cells (myocytes and cardiomyocytes) cumulate glycogen for implementing glucose as a substrate in synthesis in situ de novo of ῲ-9  mono-saturated fatty . The insulin initiates synthesis because  process this mono-saturated fatty to β-oxidation with the highest constant of reaction velocity. This is conditioned by physical chemical characteristics of  mono-saturated fatty , positioning of double bond in the chain of fatty ; this ensures maximal efficiency of ATP gaining. In phylogenesis, the low efficient palmitic alternative of metabolism of fatty acids is formed the earliest. At the later stages of phylogenesis the cells, under becoming of motion function, worked out more efficient alternative of ATP synthesis from exogenous ῲ-9  monosaturated fatty . At the late stages of phylogenesis, under becoming of biological function of locomotion (motion at the expense of contraction of cross-striated skeletal myocytes) insulin began to activate absorption of glucose by cells with subsequent synthesis of endogenous ῲ-9  mono-saturated fatty  out of it. The aphysiological effect of environment factors in the form of derangement of biological function of trophology (feeding), surplus of palmitic unesterified fatty acids in food serve as a main cause of such a high rate of functional derangement - insulin resistance syndrome in populations.

At 6 weeks old, no differences in fat mass were found between SAT and VAT in WT mice, while O-SAT showed significantly higher weight than that of O-VAT. The average adipocyte size of SAT (~ 4133.47 μm2) was smaller than that of VAT (~ 7438.91 μm2) in OB mice. O-SAT preadipocytes gained higher triglyceride contents and higher levels of PPARγ and C/EBPα than did O-VAT preadipocytes upon in vitro differentiation. W-SAT and W-VAT displayed no significant differences in fatty  uptake, while 1.36 fold significantly higher fatty  uptake was found in O-SAT compared to O-VAT. Approximately 52% of the radioactivity recovered in cellular lipids was found in TAG in O-SAT, which was significantly higher than the other three adipocyte types. Significantly more radiolabelled  was β-oxidized to CO2 in adipocytes from O-VAT than that from O-SAT. ATP production was significantly lower in W-SAT compared with W-VAT, whereas no significantly ATP level was observed between O-SAT and O-VAT. Expression of UCP-1 in SAT from either WT or OB mice was significantly higher than the counterpart of VAT, which demonstrated higher uncoupled respiration and lower oxidative phosphorylation in SAT. Together, a combined increase in adipogenesis and FA uptake, and decreases in β-oxidation and ATP production, contributed to greater expansion of SAT compared to VAT in obese mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21988913>A -targeted inhibitor of cytochrome c peroxidase mitigates radiation-induced death.</a></h2><p>The risk of radionuclide release in terrorist acts or exposure of healthy tissue during radiotherapy demand potent radioprotectants/radiomitigators.

Here we exposed bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells and human platelets to variable glucose and fatty  concentrations. We then examined oxygen consumption and acidification rates using recently available technology in the form of an extracellular oxygen and proton flux analyzer. Acute or overnight exposure of confluent BAE cells to glucose concentrations from 5.5 to 25 mM did not enhance or change the rate of oxygen consumption (OCR) under basal conditions, during ATP synthesis, or under uncoupled conditions. Glucose also did not alter OCR in sub-confluent cells, in cells exposed to low serum, or in cells treated with added pyruvate. Likewise, overnight exposure to fatty acids of varying saturation had no such effects. Overnight exposure of BAE cells to low glucose concentration decreased maximal uncoupled respiration, but not basal or ATP related oxygen consumption. Labeled glucose oxidation to CO(2) increased, but only marginally after high glucose exposure while oleate oxidation to CO(2) decreased. Overnight exposure to linolenic , but not  or linoleic  increased extracellular acidification consistent with enhanced glycolytic metabolism. We were unable to detect an increase in production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from BAE cells exposed to high medium glucose. Like BAE cells, exposure of human platelets to glucose did not increase oxygen consumption. As opposed to BAE cells, platelet  demonstrate less respiratory reserve capacity (beyond that needed for basal metabolism).

This study aims to explore whether HSS could protect carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1), an essential enzyme responsible for β-oxidation of free fatty acids in , from lipotoxicity, thus alleviating hepatic lipid deposition. To test this, the HSS gene was delivered into C57BL/6J mice and efficiently expressed in the liver. NASH mice were prepared with high-fat diet or methionine-choline-deficient diet. The results showed that hepatic inflammation and liver functions were alleviated in the HSS-transfected mice; meanwhile, the activity of CPT-1 was obviously protected. Moreover,  (OA) treatment resulted in remarkable lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells; this deposition was improved by HSS transfection. Simultaneously, the CPT-1 activity, which was impaired by OA treatment, was profoundly rescued in the HSS-expressing cells. CPT-1 activity was more severely impaired if the OA treatment was combined with S15176, a CPT-1 inhibitor. However, this impairment was effectively reduced by the HSS transfection, and the effect was enhanced by C75, a CPT-1 activator. Interestingly, if the cells were transfected with HSS-siRNA, the preservation of CPT-1 provided by HSS was again diminished.

In case of cells incubated with palmitic  (PA) and the mixtures of fatty acids, micro- and macro-vacuolar steatosis occurred in most of the cells.

Owing to its advantageous agronomic properties, C. myconis might have industrial applications. However, this species needs to be comprehensively characterized before any potential use. In a previous study, the phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of different C. myconis tissues were characterized. This investigation was extended to examine the cytotoxic potential of selected plant tissues (flowers and green parts) using a HepG2 cell line by utilizing the lysosomal neutral red uptake assay or mitochondrial (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. In addition, the macronutrients content, lipophilic compounds (fatty acids, tocopherols), and amino acids were also determined. C. myconis flowers were used in the senescence stage, which was previously identified as the stage that presented maximal phenolic content and highest antioxidant activity. In contrast, stems and leaves were employed due to their high biomass proportion. Regarding cytotoxicity, mitochondrial and lysosomal damage was only significant when HepG2 cells were exposed to the highest extract concentrations (stems and leaves, 0.9 mg/ml; senescent flowers, 0.3 mg/ml). Chemically, the senescent flowers were mostly characterized by their high levels of fat, amino acids (especially threonine), , β-, and γ-tocopherol, while stems and leaves contained high concentrations of carbohydrates, linolenic , and α-tocopherol.

Furthermore, we investigated the role of p53, a tumor suppressor protein, in the cellular response elicited by OA accumulation. OA-induced changes in cell viability and ATP production were rescued to control levels when cells were pretreated with pifithrin-alpha (PTA), a p53 inhibitor. By contrast, the expressions of LC3-II and perilipin, proteins required for lipophagy, were down-regulated by PTA pretreatment. Taken together, our results suggest that p53 plays a key role in the cellular response elicited by OA accumulation in Chang liver cells.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Although initial events leading to the biosynthesis of biotin remain largely unknown, the final steps are known to occur in the . Here we deleted the Aopex5 and Aopex7 genes encoding the receptors for peroxisomal targeting signals PTS1 and PTS2, respectively, in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae. In addition to exhibiting defects in the peroxisomal targeting of either PTS1 or PTS2 proteins, the deletion strains also displayed growth defects on minimal medium containing  as the sole carbon source. Unexpectedly, these peroxisomal transport-deficient strains also exhibited growth defects on minimal medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source that were remediated by the addition of biotin and its precursors, including 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic  (KAPA). Genome database searches in fungi and plants revealed that BioF protein/KAPA synthase, one of the biotin biosynthetic enzymes, has a PTS1 sequence at the C terminus. Fungal ΔbioF strains expressing the fungal and plant BioF proteins lacking PTS1 still exhibited growth defects in the absence of biotin, indicating that peroxisomal targeting of KAPA synthase is crucial for the biotin biosynthesis. Furthermore, in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, AtBioF localized to the peroxisomes through recognition of its PTS1 sequence, suggesting involvement of peroxisomes in biotin biosynthesis in plants. Taken together we demonstrate a novel role for peroxisomes in biotin biosynthesis and suggest the presence of as yet unidentified peroxisomal proteins that function in the earlier steps of biotin biosynthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29550120>α-Lactalbumin- complex kills tumor cells by inducing excess energy metabolism but inhibiting mRNA expression of the related enzymes.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that the anti-tumor α-lactalbumin- complex (α-LA-OA) may target the glycolysis of tumor cells. However, few data are available regarding the effects of α-LA-OA on energy metabolism. In this study, we measured glycolysis and mitochondrial functions in HeLa cells in response to α-LA-OA using the XF flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA). The gene expression of enzymes involved in glycolysis, tricarboxylic  cycle, electron transfer chain, and ATP synthesis were also evaluated. Our results show that α-LA-OA significantly enhanced the basal glycolysis and glycolytic capacity. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, including the basal respiration, maximal respiration, spare respiratory capacity and ATP production were also improved in response to α-LA-OA. The enhanced mitochondrial functions maybe partly due to the increased capacity of utilizing fatty acids and glutamine as the substrate. However, the gene expressions of pyruvate kinase M2, lactate dehydrogenase A, aconitate hydratase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 were inhibited, suggesting an insufficient ability for the glycolysis process and the tricarboxylic  cycle. The increased expression of acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2, a central enzyme involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids, would enhance the unbalance due to the decreased expression of electron transfer flavoprotein β subunit, which acts as the electron acceptor. These results indicated that α-LA-OA may induce oxidative stress due to conditions in which the ATP production is exceeding the energy demand. Our results may help clarify the mechanism of apoptosis induced by reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial destruction.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

It is therefore important to identify synthetic and natural molecules able to impair the toxic effects of 7KC. We determined the impact of 7KC on murine microglial BV-2 cells, especially its ability to trigger mitochondrial and peroxisomal dysfunction, and evaluated the protective effects of α- and γ-tocopherol, Trolox, and  (OA). Multiple complementary chemical assays, flow cytometric and biochemical methods were used to evaluate the antioxidant and cytoprotective properties of these molecules. According to various complementary assays to estimate antioxidant activity, only α-, and γ-tocopherol, and Trolox had antioxidant properties. However, only α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol and OA were able to impair 7KC-induced loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, which is associated with increased permeability to propidium iodide, an indicator of cell death. In addition, α-and γ-tocopherol, and OA were able to prevent the decrease in Abcd3 protein levels, which allows the measurement of peroxisomal mass, and in mRNA levels of Abcd1 and Abcd2, which encode for two transporters involved in peroxisomal β-oxidation. Thus, 7KC-induced side effects are associated with mitochondrial and peroxisomal dysfunction which can be inversed by natural compounds, thus supporting the hypothesis that the composition of the diet can act on the function of organelles involved in neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23130929>HAMLET: functional properties and therapeutic potential.</a></h2><p>Human α-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (HAMLET) is the first member in a new family of protein-lipid complexes that kills tumor cells with high selectivity. The protein component of HAMLET is α-lactalbumin, which in its native state acts as a substrate specifier in the lactose synthase complex, thereby defining a function essential for the survival of lactating mammals. In addition, α-lactalbumin acquires tumoricidal activity after partial unfolding and binding to . The lipid cofactor serves the dual role as a stabilizer of the altered fold of the protein and a coactivator of specific steps in tumor cell death. HAMLET is broadly tumoricidal, suggesting that the complex identifies conserved death pathways suitable for targeting by novel therapies. Sensitivity to HAMLET is defined by oncogene expression including Ras and c-Myc and by glycolytic enzymes. Cellular targets are located in the cytoplasmic membrane, cytoskeleton, , proteasomes, lysosomes and nuclei, and specific signaling pathways are rapidly activated, first by interactions of HAMLET with the cell membrane and subsequently after HAMLET internalization. Therapeutic effects of HAMLET have been demonstrated in human skin papillomas and bladder cancers, and HAMLET limits the progression of human glioblastomas, with no evidence of toxicity for normal brain or bladder tissue. These findings open up new avenues for cancer therapy and the understanding of conserved death responses in tumor cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23988748>Role of p66shc in renal toxicity of .</a></h2><p>Adult and childhood obesity is an independent risk factor in development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its progression to end-stage kidney disease. Pathologic consequences of obesity include non-esterified fatty -induced oxidative stress and consequent injury. Since the serine36-phosphorylated p66shc is a newly recognized mediator of oxidative stress and kidney injury, we studied its role in  (OA)-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial depolarization and injury in cultured renal proximal tubule cells.Renal proximal tubule cells were used and treated with OA: ROS production, mitochondrial depolarization as well as injury were determined. Transcriptional effects of OA on the p66shc gene were determined in a reporter luciferase assay. The role of p66shc in adverse effects of OA was determined using knockdown, p66shc serine36 phosphorylation and cytochrome c binding-deficient cells.We found that OA increased ROS production via the  - and to a less extent via the NADPH oxidase - resulting in ROS-dependent mitochondrial depolarization and consequent injury. Interestingly, OA also stimulated the promoter of p66shc. Hence, knockdown of p66shc, impairment its Ser36 phosphorylation (mutation of Ser36 residue to alanine) or cytochrome c binding (W134F mutation) significantly attenuated OA-dependent lipotoxicity.These results offer a novel mechanism by which obesity may lead to renal tubular injury and consequently development of CKD. Manipulation of this pathway may offer therapeutic means to ameliorate obesity-dependent renal lipotoxicity.Copyright © 2013 S.

We previously identified a potent and specific calpain 10 peptide inhibitor (CYGAK), but it was not efficacious in cells. Therefore, we created a homology model using the calpain 10 amino  sequence and calpain 1 3-D structure and docked CYGAK in the active site. Using this model we modified the inhibitor to improve potency 2-fold (CYGAbuK). To increase cellular efficacy, we created CYGAK-S-phenyl- heterodimers. Using renal mitochondrial matrix CYGAK, CYGAK-OC, and CYGAK-ON had IC(50)'s of 70, 90, and 875 nM, respectively. Using isolated whole renal  CYGAK, CYGAK-OC, and CYGAK-ON had IC(50)'s of 95, 196, and >10,000 nM, respectively. Using renal proximal tubular cells (RPTC) in primary culture, 30 min exposures to CYGAK-OC and CYGAbuK-OC decreased cellular calpain activity approximately 20% at 1 μM, and concentrations up to 100 μM had no additional effect. RPTC treated with 10 μM CYGAK-OC for 24 h induced accumulation of ATP synthase β and NDUFB8, two calpain 10 substrates. In summary, we used molecular modeling to improve the potency of CYGAK, while creating CYGAK- heterodimers to improve efficacy in cells. Since calpain 10 has been implicated in type 2 diabetes and renal aging, the use of this inhibitor may contribute to elucidating the role of calpain 10 in these and other diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25646886>Hepatic STAMP2 alleviates high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Most studies on the role of STAMP2 in metabolism have used adipose tissue. Little knowledge exists concerning the role of STAMP2 in the liver, which is a metabolically central target. We hypothesized that STAMP2 is involved in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis.We examined our hypothesis using human NAFLD patient pathology samples and a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mouse model. The molecular mechanism underlying hepatic STAMP2-mediated lipid imbalance was explored using an  (OA)-induced NAFLD in vitro model.Noticeably, the expression level of STAMP2 protein was reduced in the livers obtained from NAFLD patients and HFD-induced NAFLD mice. In vivo knockdown of hepatic STAMP2 by siRNA accelerated hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice fed a HFD. Conversely, the delivery of adenoviral STAMP2 (Ad-STAMP2) improved hepatic steatosis in HFD-induced NAFLD mice. The expression of lipogenic or adipogenic factors was increased in both in vitro and in vivo NAFLD models but was reversed by Ad-STAMP2. Adenoviral overexpression of STAMP2 improved insulin resistance in the HFD-induced NAFLD mice. In vivo and in vitro assays demonstrated that STAMP2 modulates insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism and that STAMP2 counteracts OA-induced insulin resistance by modulating insulin receptor substrate-1 stability.The present study revealed that hepatic STAMP2 plays a pivotal role in preventing HFD-induced NAFLD and that STAMP2 overexpression improves hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in NAFLD. Our findings indicate that STAMP2 may represent a suitable target for interventions targeting NAFLD.Copyright © 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) were grown in medium with elaidic  (9t-C18:1) at 50, 100, 200 and 400 μmol/l for 24 h. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry, and caspase 3, 8 and 9 activities by colorimetric assay and their mRNA expression by qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time PCR). Results showed that 9t-C18:1 induced apoptosis of HUVEC in a dose-dependent manner. The activities and mRNA expression of caspases 8, 9 and 3 were significantly increased compared with that of the control. Z-IETD-FMK and Z-LEHD-FMK inhibited the activation of caspase 3 and apoptosis induced by 9t-C18:1. Also Z-IETD-FMK inhibited the activation of caspase 9. mRNA expressions of Bid and Smac (second -derived activator of caspase)/DIABLO [direct IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis)-binding protein with low pI] were also significantly elevated. We conclude that 9t-C18:1 induces apoptosis of HUVEC through activating caspases 8, 9 and 3.

Total LCFA oxidative capacity was measured in respiration chambers after gastric infusion (n = 5 per treatment) with isoenergetic amounts of [1-(14)C]triglycerides (TGs), either  (18:1n-9) TG [3.02 mmol/kg body weight (BW)(0.75)] or erucic  (22:1n-9) TG (2.46 mmol/kg BW(0.75)). Total expired (14)CO2 was collected and quantified at 20-min intervals over 24 h. Hepatic in vitro LCFA oxidation was determined simultaneously using [1-(14)C] and erucic  substrates.The in vivo 24-h accumulative [1-(14)C]TG oxidation (percentage of energy intake/kg BW(0.75)) tended to increase with clofibrate supplementation (P = 0.10), although there was no difference in the peak or mean utilization rate. The maximal extent of  TG oxidation was 1.6-fold that of erucic  TG (P < 0.006). Hepatic in vitro LCFA oxidation increased 61% with clofibrate (P < 0.0008). The increase in  was 4-fold greater than in peroxisomes. The relative abundance of mRNA increased 2- to 3-fold for hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and its target genes (fatty acyl-coenzyme A oxidase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase) in the pigs that were administered clofibrate (P < 0.04).Clofibrate may improve in vivo LCFA oxidative utilization in neonatal pigs.© 2014 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23995233>Fatty -induced mitochondrial uncoupling elicits inflammasome-independent IL-1α and sterile vascular inflammation in atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation is a fundamental aspect of metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Cholesterol crystals are metabolic signals that trigger sterile inflammation in atherosclerosis, presumably by activating inflammasomes for IL-1β production. We found here that atherogenesis was mediated by IL-1α and we identified fatty acids as potent inducers of IL-1α-driven vascular inflammation. Fatty acids selectively stimulated the release of IL-1α but not of IL-1β by uncoupling mitochondrial respiration. Fatty -induced mitochondrial uncoupling abrogated IL-1β secretion, which deviated the cholesterol crystal-elicited response toward selective production of IL-1α. Our findings delineate a previously unknown pathway for vascular immunopathology that links the cellular response to metabolic stress with innate inflammation, and suggest that IL-1α, not IL-1β, should be targeted in patients with cardiovascular disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832407>Dietary Polyphenols Protect Against -Induced Steatosis in an in Vitro Model of NAFLD by Modulating Lipid Metabolism and Improving Mitochondrial Function.</a></h2><p>In this study, we aimed to determine the relative effectiveness of common dietary polyphenols or the isoquinoline alkaloid berberine in protecting against molecular mechanisms underlying non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) involving changes to cellular lipid metabolism and bioenergetics. In a model of steatosis using HepG2 hepatocytes, exposure of the cells to 1.5 mM  (OA) for 24 h caused steatosis and distorted cell morphology, induced the expression of mRNA for enzymes that are involved in lipogenesis and fatty  oxidation ( and ), and impaired indices of aerobic energy metabolism ( mRNA expression, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and galactose-supported ATP production). Co-treatment with 10 µM of selected polyphenols all strongly protected against the steatosis and changes in cell morphology. All polyphenols, except cyanidin, inhibited the effects on  and  and further increased  expression, suggesting a shift toward increased β-oxidation. Resveratrol, quercetin, catechin, and cyanidin, however not kuromanin or berberine, ameliorated the decreases in MMP and galactose-derived ATP. Berberine was unique in worsening the decrease in galactose-derived ATP. In further investigations of the mechanisms involved, resveratrol, catechin, and berberine increased SIRT1 enzyme activity and p-AMPKα protein, which are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. In conclusion, selected polyphenols all protected against steatosis with similar effectiveness, however through different mechanisms that increased aerobic lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18599498>Mechanisms of berberine (natural yellow 18)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction: interaction with the adenine nucleotide translocator.</a></h2><p>Berberine [Natural Yellow 18, 5,6-dihydro-9,10-dimethoxybenzo(g)-1,3-benzodioxolo (5,6-a) quinolizinium] is an alkaloid present in plants of the Berberidaceae family and used in traditional Chinese and North American medicine. We have previously demonstrated that berberine causes mitochondrial depolarization and fragmentation, with simultaneous increase in oxidative stress. We also demonstrated that berberine causes an inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and a decrease on calcium loading capacity through induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). The objective of the present work is to investigate a common target for both induction of the MPT and inhibition of respiration. The hypothesis is that berberine induces the MPT through interacting with the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT). By measuring induction of the MPT through increased mitochondrial swelling, membrane depolarization and loss of calcium retention, we observed that the effects of berberine were not inhibited by bongkrekic  although adenosine diphosphate (ADP)/oligomycin completely prevented the MPT. Also, we observed that berberine increased the depolarization effect of  on liver . The initial depolarization observed when berberine is added to  was not affected by ANT inhibitors. Taken together, we propose that berberine acts on the ANT, altering the binding of the protein to bongkrekic  but not to cyclosporin A or ADP. It is also clear that the membrane potential is required for berberine effects, most likely for allowing for its mitochondrial accumulation. Mitochondrial effects of berberine can be relevant not only for its proposed antitumor activity but also for the assessment of its organ toxicity, depending on factors such as tissue accumulation or delivery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19049607>UCP-mediated free fatty  uncoupling of isolated cortical  from fasted animals: correlations to dietary modulations.</a></h2><p>Uncoupling proteins (UCP) translocate protons from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the matrix, thereby "uncoupling" electron transport from the production of ATP. It has been shown that these proteins are highly expressed in animals maintained on the ketogenic diet (KD). Although the exact mechanism remains unclear, it is known that these proteins are activated within a protective antireactive oxygen species (ROS) mechanism by free fatty acids (FFA). In our current studies, mitochondrial samples were probed for the presence of UCP2, which is the most ubiquitously expressed UCP isoform. We found that both traumatic brain injury and fasting upregulated the expression of UCP2, with a synergistic upregulation in fasted injured animals. We then used  from fasted naive animals to screen a number of FFA for their activation of uncoupling as well as their ability to reduce ROS. We found that arachidonic  (AA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), palmitoleic , myristic , and butyric  increased mitochondrial uncoupling when added after oligomycin. These FFA, along with , also reduced ROS in  incubated with oligomycin. In order to correlate our data to KD and fasting, both of which have been shown to be neuroprotective after neurologic insult, we determined the serum levels of FFA in KD and fasted animals using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. We also determined brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FFA levels from fasted animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21801413>Cytotoxic effects and the mechanism of three types of magnetic nanoparticles on human hepatoma BEL-7402 cells.</a></h2><p>The evaluation of the toxicity of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) has attracted much attention in recent years. The current study aimed to investigate the cytotoxic effects of Fe3O4, -coated Fe3O4 (OA-Fe3O4), and carbon-coated Fe (C-Fe) nanoparticles on human hepatoma BEL-7402 cells and the mechanisms. WST-1 assay demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of three types of MNPs was in a dose-dependent manner. G1 (Fe3O4 and OA-Fe3O4) phase and G2 (C-Fe) phase cell arrests and apoptosis induced by MNPs were detected by flow cytometry analysis. The increase in apoptosis was accompanied with the Bax over-expression, mitochondrial membrane potential decrease, and the release of cytochrome C from  into cytosol. Moreover, apoptosis was further confirmed by morphological and biochemical hallmarks, such as swollen  with lysing cristae and caspase-3 activation. Our results revealed that certain concentrations of the three types of MNPs affect BEL-7402 cells viability via cell arrest and inducing apoptosis, and the MNPs-induced apoptosis is mediated through the mitochondrial-dependent pathway. The influence potency of MNPs observed in all experiments would be: C-Fe > Fe3O4 > OA-Fe3O4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29292738>Activation of PPARα by Oral Clofibrate Increases Renal Fatty  Oxidation in Developing Pigs.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) activation by clofibrate on both mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty  oxidation in the developing kidney. Ten newborn pigs from 5 litters were randomly assigned to two groups and fed either 5 mL of a control vehicle (2% Tween 80) or a vehicle containing clofibrate (75 mg/kg body weight, treatment). The pigs received oral gavage daily for three days. In vitro fatty  oxidation was then measured in kidneys with and without  inhibitors (antimycin A and rotenone) using [1-C]-labeled  (C18:1) and erucic  (C22:1) as substrates. Clofibrate significantly stimulated C18:1 and C22:1 oxidation in  ( < 0.001) but not in peroxisomes. In addition, the oxidation rate of C18:1 was greater in  than peroxisomes, while the oxidation of C22:1 was higher in peroxisomes than  ( < 0.001). Consistent with the increase in fatty  oxidation, the mRNA abundance and enzyme activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) in  were increased. Although mRNA of mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase (mHMGCS) was increased, the β-hydroxybutyrate concentration measured in kidneys did not increase in pigs treated with clofibrate.

Accompanying these changes, treatment with 6-gingerol attenuates excessive triglyceride accumulation, enhances mitochondrial function, and promotes a transition from a fast- to slow-fiber type and muscle oxidative  in the red gastrocnemius of ageing rats. More importantly, 6-gingerol not only increases the plasma and adipose tissue adiponectin concentrations, but also elevates muscular AdipoR1 expression and activates downstream AMPK phosphorylation as well as upregulates PGC-1α in vivo and in vitro.6-Gingerol may improve ectopic  accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of ageing rats.

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) phosphorylation is an adaptive response to ER stress, and reductions in eIF2alpha phosphorylation trigger beta-cell failure. Salubrinal inhibits eIF2alpha dephosphorylation and has been proposed as a novel therapy for diabetes.The objective of the study was to examine whether salubrinal modulates human islet susceptibility to lipotoxicity.Human islets were treated with oleate or palmitate, alone or in combination with salubrinal, and examined for apoptosis, ultrastructure, and gene expression.Salubrinal enhanced signaling downstream of eIF2alpha and markedly induced the proapoptotic transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, but it did not induce the inositol requiring-1alpha or activating transcription factor 6 ER stress pathways. Salubrinal potentiated the deleterious effects of oleate and palmitate in human islets. This proapoptotic effect involved ER dilation and mitochondrial rounding and fragmentation.Excessive eIF2alpha phosphorylation is poorly tolerated by human islets and exacerbates fatty -induced apoptosis through ER and mitochondrial mechanisms.

This study explored 2 major dietary fats, palmitate and oleate, in supporting endogenous TG dynamics and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α activation in sham-operated (SHAM) and hypertrophied (transverse aortic constriction [TAC]) rat hearts.Isolated SHAM and TAC hearts were provided media containing carbohydrate with either (13)C-palmitate or (13)C-oleate for dynamic (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and end point liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry of TG dynamics. With palmitate, TAC hearts contained 48% less TG versus SHAM (P=0.0003), whereas oleate maintained elevated TG in TAC, similar to SHAM. TG turnover in TAC was greatly reduced with palmitate (TAC, 46.7±12.2 nmol/g dry weight per min; SHAM, 84.3±4.9; P=0.0212), as was β-oxidation of TG. Oleate elevated TG turnover in both TAC (140.4±11.2) and SHAM (143.9±15.6), restoring TG oxidation in TAC. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α target gene transcripts were reduced by 70% in TAC with palmitate, whereas oleate induced normal transcript levels. Additionally, mRNA levels for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ-coactivator-1α and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ-coactivator-1β in TAC hearts were maintained by oleate. With these metabolic effects, oleate also supported a 25% improvement in contractility over palmitate with TAC (P=0.0202).The findings link reduced intracellular lipid storage dynamics to impaired peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α signaling and contractility in diseased hearts, consistent with a rate-dependent lipolytic activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α. In decompensated hearts, oleate may serve as a beneficial energy substrate versus palmitate by upregulating TG dynamics and nuclear receptor signaling.© 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525903>3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine modifies the lipid droplet composition in a model of hepatosteatosis.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids are the main energy stores and the major membrane components of the cells. In the hepatocyte, fatty acids are esterified to triacylglycerols (TAGs) and stored in lipid droplets (LDs). The lipid lowering action of 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine (T2) on an in vitro model of hepatosteatosis was investigated in terms of fatty  and protein content of LDs, lipid oxidation and secretion.FaO cells were exposed to oleate/palmitate, then treated with T2.T2 reduced number and size of LDs, and modified their acyl composition by decreasing the content of saturated (SFA) vs monounsaturated (MUFA) fatty acids thus reversing the SFA/MUFA ratio. The expression of the LD-associated proteins adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), oxidative tissue-enriched PAT protein (OXPAT), and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) was increased in 'steatotic' cells and further up-regulated by T2. Moreover, T2 stimulated the mitochondrial oxidation by up-regulating carnitine-palmitoyl-transferase (CPT1), uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) and very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (VLCAD).T2 leads to mobilization of TAGs from LDs and stimulates mitochondrial oxidative metabolism of fatty acids, in particular of SFAs, and thus enriches of MUFAs the LDs. This action may protect the hepatocyte from excess of SFAs that are more toxic than MUFAs.© 2014 S.

Methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) catalyzed by the methyl transferases Cho2p/Pem1p and Opi3p/Pem2p as well as incorporation of choline through the CDP (cytidine diphosphate)-choline branch of the Kennedy pathway lead to PC formation. To determine the contribution of these two pathways to the supply of PC to peroxisomes (PX), yeast mutants bearing defects in the two pathways were cultivated under peroxisome inducing conditions, i.e. in the presence of , and subjected to biochemical and cell biological analyses. Phenotype studies revealed compromised growth of both the cho20Δopi3Δ (mutations in the methylation pathway) and the cki1Δdpl1Δeki1Δ (mutations in the CDP-choline pathway) mutant when grown on . Analysis of peroxisomes from the two mutant strains showed that both pathways produce PC for the supply to peroxisomes, although the CDP-choline pathway seemed to contribute with higher efficiency than the methylation pathway. Changes in the peroxisomal lipid pattern of mutants caused by defects in the PC biosynthetic pathways resulted in changes of membrane properties as shown by anisotropy measurements with fluorescent probes. In summary, our data define the origin of peroxisomal PC and demonstrate the importance of PC for peroxisome membrane formation and integrity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30602451>Minerval (2-hydroxyoleic ) causes cancer cell selective toxicity by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation and compromising bioenergetic compensation capacity.</a></h2><p>This work tests bioenergetic and cell-biological implications of the synthetic fatty  Minerval (2-hydroxyoleic ), previously demonstrated to act by activation of sphingomyelin synthase in the plasma membrane (PM) and lowering of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) and their carcinogenic signaling. We show here that Minerval also acts, selectively in cancer cell lines, as an ATP depleting uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). As a function of its exposure time, Minerval compromised the capacity of glioblastoma U87-MG cells to compensate for aberrant respiration by up-modulation of glycolysis. This effect was not exposure time-dependent in the lung carcinoma A549 cell line, which was more sensitive to Minerval. Compared with OxPhos inhibitors FCCP (uncoupler), rotenone (electron transfer inhibitor), and oligomycin (F1F0-ATPase inhibitor), Minerval action was similar only to that of FCCP. This similarity was manifested by mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization, facilitation of oxygen consumption rate (OCR), restriction of mitochondrial and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial fragmentation. Additionally, compared with other OxPhos inhibitors, Minerval uniquely induced ER stress in cancer cell lines. These new modes of action for Minerval, capitalizing on the high fatty  requirements of cancer cells, can potentially enhance its cancer-selective toxicity and improve its therapeutic capacity.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18992353>Peroxisomal ABC transporters and beta-oxidation during the life cycle of the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina.</a></h2><p>ATP-binding cassette transporters are ubiquitous proteins that facilitate transport of diverse substances across a membrane. However, their exact role remains poorly understood. In order to test their function in a fungus life cycle, we deleted the two Podospora anserina peroxisomal ABC transporter pABC1 and pABC2 genes as well as the three genes involved in peroxisomal (fox2) and mitochondrial (scdA and echA) beta-oxidation. Analysis of the single and double mutants shows that fatty  beta-oxidation occurs in both organelles. Furthermore, the peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty  beta-oxidation pathways are both dispensable for vegetative and sexual development. They are, however, differently required for ascospore pigmentation and germination, this latter defect being restored in a DeltapABC1 and DeltapABC2 background. We report also that lack of peroxisomal ABC transporters does not prevent peroxisomal long-chain fatty  oxidation, suggesting the existence of another pathway for their import into peroxisomes. Finally, we show that some aspects of fatty  degradation are clearly fungus species specific.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30943799>Omega-3 fatty  decreases  by decreasing SCD-1 expression in the liver and kidney of a cyclosporine-induced nephropathy rat model.</a></h2><p>Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD)-1 and elongase-6 (Elovl-6) are associated with fatty  (FA) synthesis.

The prior studies have shown that ASD alleviates hepatic steatosis targeted at the modulation of autophagy and exerts hepatoprotective effects through . However, it is still unclear which signal transduction pathway that ASD increase autophagy and protect the . The purpose of this paper was to explore the mechanisms through which ASD alleviates hepatic steatosis. ASD significantly reduced lipid accumulation in BRL cells. Furthermore, ASD significantly increased the mitophagy acting as increase the colocalization between  and punctate EGFP-LC3. ASD treatment increased the expression of BNip3, phospho-AMPK, prevented  (OA) induced LC3-II and phospho-mTOR expression. These effects were similar to the effects cotreatment with rapamycin. ASD treatment could not attenuate the expression of BNip3 blocked by chloroquine (CQ) or siRNA-mediated knockdown of BNip3. These results suggest that Akebia saponin D alleviates hepatic steatosis targeted at BNip3 mediated mitophagy. Activation of BNip3 via ASD may offer a new strategy for treating NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

Possible different oxidation rates of vaccenic versus elaidic  were checked in muscles and liver, and through related gene expression in normal rat liver cells. In hepatic , carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) I exhibited comparable activity rates with both trans-isomers. CPT II activity was 30% greater (P < 0.05) with vaccenic than with elaidic  as nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) or acyl-CoAs. Activity of the first beta-oxidation step was similar between the isomers in all the tissue slices and liver extracts assayed. Respiration rates were comparable with both trans-isomers as NEFAs in various liver extracts, but were 30% greater (P < 0.05) with vaccenoyl-CoA than with elaidoyl-CoA in liver . Vaccenic  was oxidised 25% more (P < 0.05) by liver peroxisomes than elaidic . In hepatocytes cultured with trans- and corresponding cis-C(18:1) isomers, gene expression of CPT I, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase was at least 100% increased (P < 0.05), but was unchanged with vaccenic , relative to controls. In conclusion, the position and geometry of the double bonds in acyl chains are suggested to confer on vaccenic and elaidic  specific biochemical properties that might differently affect their fates in tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21757842>Clofibric  increases the formation of  in endoplasmic reticulum of the liver of rats.</a></h2><p>The effects of 2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-methylpropionic  (clofibric ) on the formation of  (18:1) from stearic  (18:0) and utilization of the 18:1 formed for phosphatidylcholine (PC) formation in endoplasmic reticulum in the liver of rats were studied in vivo.

The balance between pyruvate and fatty  oxidation in generating ATP is not established. We have combined coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) imaging with deuterium labelling of  to monitor turnover of fatty acids within lipid droplets of living mouse eggs. We found that loss of labelled  is promoted by pyruvate removal but minimised when β-oxidation is inhibited. Pyruvate removal also causes a significant dispersion of lipid droplets, while inhibition of β-oxidation causes droplet clustering. Live imaging of luciferase or FAD autofluorescence from , suggest that inhibition of β-oxidation in mouse eggs only leads to a transient decrease in ATP because there is compensatory uptake of pyruvate into . Inhibition of pyruvate uptake followed by β-oxidation caused a similar and successive decline in ATP. Our data suggest that β-oxidation and pyruvate oxidation contribute almost equally to resting ATP production in resting mouse eggs and that reorganisation of lipid droplets occurs in response to metabolic demand.© 2019.

However, mammalian skeletal muscles are composed of mixed types of muscle fibers. In the current study, we analyzed and compared the distributions of titin, , phosphate ions, and fatty  levels in red and white muscles using a fish model (), which is rich in red and white muscles, and these are well separated. Oil-red O staining showed that red muscle had more-abundant lipids than did white muscle. A time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometric (TOF-SIMS) analysis revealed that red muscle possessed high levels of palmitic  and , but white muscle contained more phosphate ions. Moreover, elastica-van Gieson (EVG) and Mito-Tracker green FM staining showed that collagen and elastic fibers were highly, respectively, distributed in connective tissues and mitochondria in red muscle. An electron micrographic analysis indicated that red muscle had a relatively higher number of mitochondria and longer sarcomere lengths and Z-line widths, while myofibril diameters were thicker in white muscle. Myofibrillar proteins separated by SDS-PAGE showed that the major giant protein, titin, was highly expressed in white muscle than in red muscle. Furthermore, ratios of titin to myosin heavy chain (MHC) (titin/MHC) were about 1.3 times higher in white muscle than red muscle. We postulated that white muscle is fit for short and strong contractile performance due to high levels of titin and condensed sarcomeres, whereas red muscle is fit for low intensity and long-lasting activity due to high levels of lipids and mitochondria and long sarcomeres.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20065148>Metabolomics in angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin II (Ang II) induces mitochondrial dysfunction. We tested whether Ang II alters the "metabolomic" profile. We harvested hearts from 8-week-old double transgenic rats harboring human renin and angiotensinogen genes (dTGRs) and controls (Sprague-Dawley), all with or without Ang II type 1 receptor (valsartan) blockade. We used gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry to detect 247 intermediary metabolites. We used a partial least-squares discriminate analysis and identified 112 metabolites that differed significantly after corrections (false discovery rate q <0.05). We found great differences in the use of fatty acids as an energy source, namely, decreased levels of octanoic, , and linoleic acids in dTGR (all P<0.01). The increase in cardiac hypoxanthine levels in dTGRs suggested an increase in purine degradation, whereas other changes supported an increased ketogenic amino  tyrosine level, causing energy production failure. The metabolomic profile of valsartan-treated dTGRs more closely resembled Sprague-Dawley rats than untreated dTGRs. Mitochondrial respiratory chain activity of cytochrome C oxidase was decreased in dTGRs, whereas complex I and complex II were unaltered.  from dTGR hearts showed morphological alterations suggesting increased mitochondrial fusion. Cardiac expression of the redox-sensitive and the cardioprotective metabolic sensor sirtuin 1 was increased in dTGRs. Interestingly, valsartan changed the level of 33 metabolites and induced mitochondrial biogenesis in Sprague-Dawley rats. Thus, distinct patterns of cardiac substrate use in Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. The finding underscores the importance of Ang II in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and cardiac metabolomics, even in healthy hearts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30821938>[The physical chemical and biological features of triglycerides.

This significantly increases the level of cholesterol in high-density lipoproteins. Food enriched with medium chain TG is optimal for increasing the ketone content in blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid without limiting the carbohydrate content in food. The formation of excess ketone bodies by cells can be achieved by activating the metabolic transformations of medium-chain FAs, without fasting and preserving carbohydrates in food.

It has already been established that, in the presence of pyruvate/malate, BAT  are coupled by faf-BSA (fatty--free BSA) and GDP, leading to an increase in ATP synthesis and mitochondrial membrane potential along with simultaneous decreases in both the rates of respiration and heat production. Oleate restores the uncoupled state, inhibiting ATP synthesis and increasing the rates of both respiration and heat production. We now show that in the presence of succinate: (i) the rates of uncoupled  respiration and heat production are five times slower than in the presence of pyruvate/malate; (ii) faf-BSA and GDP accelerate heat and respiration as a result and, in coupled , these two rates are accelerated compared with pyruvate/malate; (iii) in spite of the differences in respiration and heat production noted with the two substrates, the membrane potential and the ATP synthesized were the same; and (iv) oleate promoted a decrease in heat production and respiration in coupled , an effect different from that observed using pyruvate/malate.

Here, we investigated whether eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), a metabolic precursor to DHA, had similar effects and whether retinal neurons could metabolize EPA to DHA. Adding EPA to rat retina neuronal cultures increased opsin expression and protected photoreceptors from apoptosis induced by the oxidants paraquat and hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ). Palmitic, , and arachidonic acids had no protective effect, showing the specificity for DHA. We found that EPA supplementation significantly increased DHA percentage in retinal neurons, but not EPA percentage. Photoreceptors and glial cells expressed Δ6 desaturase (FADS2), which introduces the last double bond in DHA biosynthetic pathway. Pre-treatment of neuronal cultures with CP-24879 hydrochloride, a Δ5/Δ6 desaturase inhibitor, prevented EPA-induced increase in DHA percentage and completely blocked EPA protection and its effect on photoreceptor differentiation. These results suggest that EPA promoted photoreceptor differentiation and rescued photoreceptors from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis through its elongation and desaturation to DHA. Our data show, for the first time, that isolated retinal neurons can synthesize DHA in culture. Docosahexaenoic  (DHA), the major polyunsaturated fatty  in retina photoreceptors, and its precursor, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) have multiple beneficial effects. Here, we show that retina neurons in vitro express the desaturase FADS2 and can synthesize DHA from EPA.

We compared the effects of the saturated FFA palmitate, the unsaturated FFA oleate, and a mixture of each on the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, mitochondrial function, apoptosis, and insulin-signaling pathway in skeletal muscle cells. Only palmitate caused a significant increase of mtROS production, which correlated with concomitant mtDNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, induction of JNK, apoptosis, and inhibition of insulin signaling. Blocking de novo synthesis of ceramide abolished the effects of palmitate on mtROS production, viability, and insulin signaling. Oleate alone did not cause mtROS generation and mtDNA damage, and its addition to palmitate prevented palmitate-induced mtDNA damage, increased total ATP levels and cell viability, and prevented palmitate-induced apoptosis and inhibition of insulin-stimulated Akt (Ser(473)) phosphorylation. The peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) protein level and promoter activity were decreased at concentrations of palmitate ≥0.5 mM, whereas addition of oleate increased both PGC-1α level and promoter activity. Expression of the mitochondrial transcription factor (TFAM) was significantly diminished after palmitate but not oleate treatment. Addition of the ROS scavenger, N-acetylcystein (NAC), to palmitate restored both the expression and promoter activity of PGC-1α as well as TFAM expression. We propose that 1) mtROS generation is the initial event in the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction and consequent apoptosis and the inhibition of insulin signaling and that 2) oleate ameliorates palmitate-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and thus may contribute to the prevention of palmitate-induced IR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27061349>Influence of tissue, diet, and enzymatic remodeling on cardiolipin fatty acyl profile.</a></h2><p>Cardiolipin is a specialized phospholipid found primarily in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Because of its unique dimeric structure, cardiolipin plays an important role in mitochondrial function, stability, and membrane fluidity. As such, cardiolipin is subject to a high degree of remodeling by phospholipases, acyltransferases, and transacylases that create a fatty acyl profile that tends to be highly tissue-specific. Despite this overarching regulation, the molecular species of cardiolipin produced are also influenced by dietary lipid composition. A number of studies have characterized the tissue-specific profile of cardiolipin species and have investigated the specific nature of cardiolipin remodeling, including the role of both enzymes and diet.

Here, we show that the cardiac oleate content is increased in tristearate (TS)- and trioleate (TO)-fed rats when compared with chow-fed rats. TS or TO feeding increases mitochondrial fatty  oxidation via activation of expression of the oxidative genes, activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway, and a decrease in glucose uptake. These results suggest that , both dietary and de novo synthesized, affects substrate utilization in the heart. Furthermore, our data show that the endogenous synthesis of oleate in the heart can compensate for a deficiency of this fatty  in the diet.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. and  Research Society.

In contrast to most normal cells, FASN is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers including cutaneous melanoma, in which its levels of expression are associated with a poor prognosis and depth of invasion. Recently, we have demonstrated the mitochondrial involvement in FASN inhibition-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells. Herein we compare, via electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), free fatty acids (FFA) composition of  isolated from control (EtOH-treated cells) and Orlistat-treated B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the ESI-MS data and found to separate the two groups of samples.  from control cells showed predominance of six ions, that is, those of m/z 157 (Pelargonic, 9:0), 255 (Palmitic, 16:0), 281 (, 18:1), 311 (Arachidic, 20:0), 327 (Docosahexaenoic, 22:6) and 339 (Behenic, 22:0). In contrast, FASN inhibition with Orlistat changes significantly mitochondrial FFA composition by reducing synthesis of palmitic , and its elongation and unsaturation products, such as arachidic and behenic acids, and , respectively. ESI-MS of  isolated from Orlistat-treated cells presented therefore three major ions of m/z 157 (Pelargonic, 9:0), 193 (unknown) and 199 (Lauric, 12:0).

The AMP-activated protein kinase regulates this process in mammalian cells, and its homolog Snf1, together with the transcription factors Adr1, Oaf1, and Pip2, regulates peroxisome proliferation and beta-oxidation in yeast. A constitutive allele of Adr1 (Adr1(c)) lacking the glucose- and Snf1-regulated phosphorylation substrate Ser-230 was found to be Snf1-independent for regulation of peroxisomal genes. In addition, it could compensate for and even suppress the requirement for Oaf1 or Pip2 for gene induction. Peroxisomal genes were found to be regulated by oleate in the presence of glucose, as long as Adr1(c) was expressed, suggesting that the Oaf1/Pip2 heterodimer is Snf1-independent. Consistent with this observation, Oaf1 binding to promoters in the presence of oleate was not reduced in a snf1Delta strain. Exploring the mechanism by which Adr1(c) permits Snf1-independent peroxisomal gene induction, we found that strength of promoter binding did not correlate with transcription, suggesting that stable binding is not a prerequisite for enhanced transcription. Instead, enhanced transcriptional activation and suppression of Oaf1, Pip2, and Snf1 by Adr1(c) may be related to the ability of Adr1(c) to suppress the requirement for and enhance the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators in a promoter- and growth medium-dependent manner.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21314620>Dietary supplementation of old rats with hydrogenated peanut oil restores activities of mitochondrial respiratory complexes in skeletal muscles.</a></h2><p>The effect of dietary supplementation of old rats (26-33 months) with hydrogenated peanut oil on the activity of mitochondrial enzymes in skeletal muscles has been studied. The activities of NADH-coenzyme Q1 oxidoreductase, cytochrome c oxidase, and citrate synthase were determined spectrophotometrically in muscle homogenates. The activities of respiratory complexes I and IV were shown to significantly decrease with the age compared to the activity of the same enzymes in young animals, while the activity of citrate synthase was virtually unchanged. The fatty  composition of muscle homogenates of old rats differed from that of young animals by a reduced content of myristic, , linoleic, and α-linolenic acids and enhanced content of dihomo-γ-linolenic, arachidonic, and docosahexaenoic acids. Per oral supplementation of the old rats with hydrogenated peanut oil completely restored the activity of complex IV and increased the activity of complex I to 80% of the value observed in muscles of young animals, reducing the content of stearic, dihomo-γ-linolenic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, docosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids relative to that in the groups of old and young rats. The content of  and linoleic acids increased relatively to that in the group of the old rats, as well as young animals.

Effect of SR extract on plasma levels of markers of hepatic damage, plasma and hepatic lipids, mitochondrial oxidative stress, status of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants and histopathological changes in liver tissue were evaluated in high fat diet fed C57BL/6J mice. Also, the effect of SR supplementation on lipid accumulation, lipid peroxidation, cytotoxicity and cell viability were evaluated in  treated HepG2 cells. Supplementation of NASH mice with SR extract prevented high fat diet induced elevation in plasma marker enzymes of liver damage, plasma and hepatic lipids, mitochondrial oxidative stress and compromised enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant status. Further, addition of SR extract to in vitro HepG2 cells minimized  induced lipid accumulation, higher lipid peroxidation, cytotoxicity and reduced cell viability. These in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that SR extract has the potential of preventing high fat/fatty  induced NASH mainly due to its hypolipidemic and antioxidant activities.Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

The purpose of the present study was to examine if chronic hyperglycemia would impair metabolic switching of myotubes. Human myotubes were treated with or without chronic hyperglycemia (20mmol/l glucose for 4 days), and metabolism of [(14)C] (OA) and [(14)C]glucose was studied. Myotubes exposed to chronic hyperglycemia showed a significantly reduced OA uptake and oxidation to CO(2), whereas -soluble metabolites were increased compared to normoglycemic cells (5.5mmol/l glucose). Glucose suppressibility, the ability of acute glucose (5mmol/l) to suppress lipid oxidation, was 50% in normoglycemic cells and reduced to 21% by hyperglycemia. Adaptability, the capacity to increase lipid oxidation with increasing fatty  availability, was not affected by hyperglycemia. Glucose uptake and oxidation were reduced by about 40% after hyperglycemia, and oxidation of glucose in presence of mitochondrial uncouplers showed that net and maximal oxidative capacities were significantly reduced. Hyperglycemia also abolished insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Moreover, ATP concentration was reduced by 25% after hyperglycemia. However, none of the measured mitochondrial genes were downregulated nor was mitochondrial DNA content. Microarray and real-time RT-PCR showed that no genes were significantly regulated by chronic hyperglycemia. Addition of chronic lactate reduced both glucose and OA oxidation to the same extent as hyperglycemia. In conclusion, chronic hyperglycemia reduced substrate oxidation in skeletal muscle cells and impaired metabolic switching. The effect is most likely due to an induced mitochondrial dysfunction.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This may be related to FFA-induced elevation of oxidative stress in endothelial cells. We hypothesized that, in addition to mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-mediated reactive oxygen species production contributes to  (OA)-induced oxidative stress in endothelial cells, due to eNOS uncoupling. We measured reactive oxygen species production and eNOS activity in cultured endothelial cells (bEnd.3) in the presence of OA bound to bovine serum albumin, using the CM-H2DCFDA assay and the L-arginine/citrulline conversion assay, respectively. OA induced a concentration-dependent increase in reactive oxygen species production, which was inhibited by the mitochondrial complex II inhibitor thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA). OA had little effect on eNOS activity when stimulated by a calcium-ionophore, but decreased both basal and insulin-induced eNOS activity, which was restored by TTFA. Pretreatment of bEnd.3 cells with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) prevented OA-induced reactive oxygen species production and restored inhibition of eNOS activity by OA. Elevation of OA levels leads to both impairment in receptor-mediated stimulation of eNOS and to production of mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species and hence endothelial dysfunction.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As the most abundant FFA in the bloodstream,  (OA) has the ability to induce adipogenic differentiation in human adipose-derived stromal cells (hADSCs). Recently, p62, an autophagy mediator, has been shown to play a role in obesity and adipose tissue metabolism. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the roles of autophagy and mitochondrial function at different stages of OA (in combination with insulin and dexamethasone)-induced adipogenesis in hADSCs.The hADSCs were incubated with OA, insulin, and dexamethasone after pretreatment with autophagy inhibitors or knockdown of p62 with shRNA. The adiposeness level was then analyzed by oil red O staining in the cells. The related proteins or mRNA levels were detected by western blot analysis or quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Treatment with 80 μM OA (substituted for isobutylmethylxantine; IBMX) for 10 days successfully induced hADSCs to adipocytes. During OA-induced adipogenesis, autophagy was induced, with an increased LC3II/I ratio on day 3 and a decreased protein level of p62 on and after day 3. Inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyladenine (3MA) at the early stage (day 0 to day 3) of differentiation, but not at the middle or late stage, significantly decreased OA-induced adipogenesis; while knockdown of p62 with shRNA significantly promoted adipogenesis in hADSCs. Moreover, the copy number of mtDNA (the ND1 gene) and the protein level of TOM20, a mitochondrial membrane protein, were increased following OA treatment, which was related to the stability of . Interestingly, knockdown of p62 increased the mito-LC3II/I and cyto-LC3II/I ratios by 110.1% and 73.3%, respectively. The increase in the ratio of mito-LC3II/I was higher than that of cyto-LC3II/I. Furthermore, p62 knockdown-enhanced adipogenesis in hADSCs was abolished by inhibiting mitophagy with cyclosporine A.These results suggested that p62 plays a protective role in adipogenesis of hADSCs through regulating mitophagy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18649145>The effect of N-ethylmaleimide on permeability transition as induced by carboxyatractyloside, agaric , and oleate.</a></h2><p>In this work, we studied the effect of N-ethylmaleimide on permeability transition.

Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) can inhibit feeding and stimulate lipolysis by activating peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor-α (PPARα) in white adipose tissue (WAT). Here we explore whether PPARα activation potentiates the effect of β3-adrenergic stimulation on energy balance mediated by the respective agonists OEA and CL316243. The effect of this pharmacological association on feeding, thermogenesis, β-oxidation, and lipid and cholesterol metabolism in epididymal (e)WAT was monitored. CL316243 (1 mg/kg) and OEA (5 mg/kg) co-administration over 6 days enhanced the reduction of both food intake and body weight gain, increased the energy expenditure and reduced the respiratory quotient (VCO2/VO2). This negative energy balance agreed with decreased fat mass and increased BAT weight and temperature, as well as with lowered plasma levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, nonessential fatty acids (NEFAs), and the adipokines leptin and TNF-α. Regarding eWAT, CL316243 and OEA treatment elevated levels of the thermogenic factors PPARα and UCP1, reduced p38-MAPK phosphorylation, and promoted brown-like features in the white adipocytes: the mitochondrial (Cox4i1, Cox4i2) and BAT (Fgf21, Prdm16) genes were overexpressed in eWAT. The enhancement of the fatty- β-oxidation factors Cpt1b and Acox1 in eWAT was accompanied by an upregulation of de novo lipogenesis and reduced expression of the unsaturated-fatty--synthesis enzyme gene, Scd1. We propose that the combination of β-adrenergic and PPARα receptor agonists promotes therapeutic adipocyte remodelling in eWAT, and therefore has a potential clinical utility in the treatment of obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22457744>Electrical pulse stimulation of cultured human skeletal muscle cells as an in vitro model of exercise.</a></h2><p>Physical exercise leads to substantial adaptive responses in skeletal muscles and plays a central role in a healthy life style. Since exercise induces major systemic responses, underlying cellular mechanisms are difficult to study in vivo. It was therefore desirable to develop an in vitro model that would resemble training in cultured human myotubes.Electrical pulse stimulation (EPS) was applied to adherent human myotubes. Cellular contents of ATP, phosphocreatine (PCr) and lactate were determined. Glucose and  metabolism were studied using radio-labeled substrates, and gene expression was analyzed using real-time RT-PCR. Mitochondrial content and function were measured by live imaging and determination of citrate synthase activity, respectively. Protein expression was assessed by electrophoresis and immunoblotting.High-frequency, acute EPS increased deoxyglucose uptake and lactate production, while cell contents of both ATP and PCr decreased. Chronic, low-frequency EPS increased oxidative capacity of cultured myotubes by increasing glucose metabolism (uptake and oxidation) and complete fatty  oxidation. mRNA expression level of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex 4 (PDK4) was significantly increased in EPS-treated cells, while mRNA expressions of interleukin 6 (IL-6), cytochrome C and carnitin palmitoyl transferase b (CPT1b) also tended to increase. Intensity of MitoTracker®Red FM was doubled after 48 h of chronic, low-frequency EPS. Protein expression of a slow fiber type marker (MHCI) was increased in EPS-treated cells.Our results imply that in vitro EPS (acute, high-frequent as well as chronic, low-frequent) of human myotubes may be used to study effects of exercise.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23581822>Peroxysomal carnitine acetyl transferase influences host colonization capacity in Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.</a></h2><p>In lower eukaryotes, the glyoxylate cycle allows cells to utilize two-carbon compounds when simple sugars are not available. In filamentous fungi, glyoxylate metabolism is coupled with β-oxidation of fatty acids, and both are localized to ubiquitous eukaryotic organelles called peroxisomes. Acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) produced during β-oxidation is transported via the cytosol into  for further metabolism. A peroxisomal-specific pathway for acetyl-CoA transport requiring peroxisomal carnitine acetyl transferase (CAT) activity has been identified in Magnaporthe grisea peroxisomes. Here, we report that a Sclerotinia sclerotiorum ortholog of the M. grisea peroxisomal CAT-encoding gene Pth2 (herein designated Ss-pth2) is required for virulence-associated host colonization. Null (ss-pth2) mutants, obtained by in vitro transposon mutagenesis, failed to utilize fatty acids, acetate, or glycerol as sole carbon sources for growth. Gene expression analysis of these mutants showed altered levels of transcript accumulation for glyoxylate cycle enzymes. Ss-pth2 disruption also affected sclerotial, apothecial, and appressorial development and morphology, as well as oxalic  accumulation when cultured with acetate or  as sole carbon nutrient sources. Although mutants were able to penetrate and initially colonize host tissue, subsequent colonization was impaired. Genetic complementation with the wild-type Ss-pth2 restored wild-type virulence phenotypes. These findings suggest an essential role in S. sclerotiorum for the peroxisomal metabolic pathways for oxalic  synthesis and host colonization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20837491>Increased mitochondrial fatty  oxidation is sufficient to protect skeletal muscle cells from palmitate-induced apoptosis.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms underlying the protective effect of monounsaturated fatty acids (e.g. oleate) against the lipotoxic action of saturated fatty acids (e.g. palmitate) in skeletal muscle cells remain poorly understood. This study aimed to examine the role of mitochondrial long-chain fatty  (LCFA) oxidation in mediating oleate's protective effect against palmitate-induced lipotoxicity. CPT1 (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1), which is the key regulatory enzyme of mitochondrial LCFA oxidation, is inhibited by malonyl-CoA, an intermediate of lipogenesis. We showed that expression of a mutant form of CPT1 (CPT1mt), which is active but insensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition, in C2C12 myotubes led to increased LCFA oxidation flux even in the presence of high concentrations of glucose and insulin. Furthermore, similar to preincubation with oleate, CPT1mt expression protected muscle cells from palmitate-induced apoptosis and insulin resistance by decreasing the content of deleterious palmitate derivates (i.e. diacylglycerols and ceramides). Oleate preincubation exerted its protective effect by two mechanisms: (i) in contrast to CPT1mt expression, oleate preincubation increased the channeling of palmitate toward triglycerides, as a result of enhanced diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 expression, and (ii) oleate preincubation promoted palmitate oxidation through increasing CPT1 expression and modulating the activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and AMP-activated protein kinase. In conclusion, we demonstrated that targeting mitochondrial LCFA oxidation via CPT1mt expression leads to the same protective effect as oleate preincubation, providing strong evidence that redirecting palmitate metabolism toward oxidation is sufficient to protect against palmitate-induced lipotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24341187>[The palmitic and  modes of metabolism of fatty acids.

The development of hyperglycemia occurred billions years hitherto under implementation of nutrition function. The insulin was formed in the process of development of biologic function of locomotion. The syndrome of resistance to insulin consists in the derangement of humoral regulation of metabolism of fatty acids and glucose at the phylogenetically different levels in vivo both in paracrine cells cenosis and at the level of organism. The exogenous and endogenic syndromes of resistance to insulin are distinguished. The exogenous resistance to insulin is formed under physiologic function of insulin system when hormone effect is prevented by derangement of biologic function of trophology (nutrition)--the formation of such palmitinic mode of metabolism of fatty acids as substrates for oxidation in . The endogenic syndrome of resistance to insulin consists in discrepancy of regulation of biologic functions at the level of organism under realization of locomotion function and at the level of paracrine cells cenosis under realization of biologic function of adaptation, endoecology (support of "cleanness" of intracellular medium) and its biologic reaction of inflammation, homeostasis function. The syndrome of resistance to insulin is energetic issue in vivo. Primarily, insulin regulates metabolism of fatty acids and only secondly metabolic transformations of glucose. In case ofpalmitinic mode of metabolism offatty acids in the enzymes with the same parameters are involved in biologic reactions.

Nitro-oxidative stress seems to be involved in its pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine whether fatty acids are implicated in the pathogenesis of this mitochondrial defect. In HepG2 cells, we analyzed the effect of saturated (palmitic and stearic acids) and monounsaturated () fatty acids on: OXPHOS activity; levels of protein expression of OXPHOS complexes and their subunits; gene expression and half-life of OXPHOS complexes; nitro-oxidative stress; and NADPH oxidase gene expression and activity. We also studied the effects of inhibiting or silencing NADPH oxidase on the palmitic--induced nitro-oxidative stress and subsequent OXPHOS inhibition. Exposure of cultured HepG2 cells to saturated fatty acids resulted in a significant decrease in the OXPHOS activity. This effect was prevented in the presence of a mimic of manganese superoxide dismutase. Palmitic  reduced the amount of both fully-assembled OXPHOS complexes and of complex subunits. This reduction was due mainly to an accelerated degradation of these subunits, which was associated with a 3-tyrosine nitration of mitochondrial proteins. Pretreatment of cells with uric , an antiperoxynitrite agent, prevented protein degradation induced by palmitic . A reduced gene expression also contributed to decrease mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded subunits. Saturated fatty acids induced oxidative stress and caused mtDNA oxidative damage. This effect was prevented by inhibiting NADPH oxidase. These acids activated NADPH oxidase gene expression and increased NADPH oxidase activity. Silencing this oxidase abrogated totally the inhibitory effect of palmitic  on OXPHOS complex activity. We conclude that saturated fatty acids caused nitro-oxidative stress, reduced OXPHOS complex half-life and activity, and decreased gene expression of mtDNA-encoded subunits. These effects were mediated by activation of NADPH oxidase. That is, these acids reproduced mitochondrial dysfunction found in humans and animals with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.© 2015.

A number of experimental studies have shown that NEFA may have an important role in fatty  metabolism in the liver, especially in dairy cows that experience negative energy balance (NEB) during early lactation.In this study, using fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR, ELISA, and primary hepatocytes cultured in vitro, we examined the effect of NEFA (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, and 3.2 mmol/L) on fatty  metabolism by monitoring the mRNA and protein expression of the following key enzymes: long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL), carnitine palmitoyltransferase IA (CPT IA), long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACADL), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC).The mRNA and protein expression levels of ACSL and ACADL markedly increased as the concentration of NEFA in the media was increased. The mRNA and protein expression levels of CPT IA were enhanced significantly when the NEFA concentrations increased from 0 to 1.6 mmol/L and decreased significantly when the NEFA concentrations increased from 1.6 to 3.2 mmol/L. The mRNA and protein expression of ACC decreased gradually with increasing concentrations of NEFA.These findings indicate that increased NEFA significantly promote the activation and β-oxidation of fatty acids, but very high NEFA concentrations may inhibit the translocation of fatty acids into  of hepatocytes. This may explain the development of ketosis or liver lipidosis in dairy cows. CPT IA might be the key control enzyme of the fatty  oxidation process in hepatocytes.© 2014 S.

In this study, we investigated whether L-carnitine suppresses -induced MPT using isolated  from rat liver. -induced MPT in isolated , inhibited endogenous respiration, caused membrane depolarization, and increased large amplitude swelling, and cytochrome c (Cyt. c) release from . L-Carnitine was indispensable to beta-oxidation of  in the , and this reaction required ATP and coenzyme A (CoA). In the presence of ATP and CoA, L-carnitine stimulated  oxidation and suppressed the -induced depolarization, swelling, and Cyt. c release. L-Carnitine also contributed to maintaining mitochondrial function, which was decreased by the generation of free fatty acids with the passage of time after isolation. These results suggest that L-carnitine acts to maintain mitochondrial function and suppresses -mediated MPT through acceleration of beta-oxidation.Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19780047>Saturated fatty -induced insulin resistance is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle cells.</a></h2><p>Increased plasma levels of free fatty acids (FFA) occur in states of insulin resistance such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. These high levels of plasma FFA are proposed to play an important role for the development of insulin resistance but the mechanisms involved are still unclear. This study investigated the effects of saturated and unsaturated FFA on insulin sensitivity in parallel with mitochondrial function. C2C12 myotubes were treated for 24 h with 0.1 mM of saturated (palmitic and stearic) and unsaturated (, linoleic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic) FFA. After this period, basal and insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function were evaluated. Saturated palmitic and stearic acids decreased insulin-induced glycogen synthesis, glucose oxidation, and lactate production. Basal glucose oxidation was also reduced. Palmitic and stearic acids impaired mitochondrial function as demonstrated by decrease of both mitochondrial hyperpolarization and ATP generation. These FFA also decreased Akt activation by insulin. As opposed to saturated FFA, unsaturated FFA did not impair glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function. Primary cultures of rat skeletal muscle cells exhibited similar responses to saturated FFA as compared to C2C12 cells. These results show that in muscle cells saturated FFA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction associated with impaired insulin-induced glucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29235175>Acetate provokes mitochondrial stress and cell death in Ustilago maydis.</a></h2><p>The fungal pathogen Ustilago maydis causes disease on maize by mating to establish an infectious filamentous cell type that invades the host and induces tumours. We previously found that β-oxidation mutants were defective in virulence and did not grow on acetate. Here, we demonstrate that acetate inhibits filamentation during mating and in response to . We therefore examined the influence of different carbon sources by comparing the transcriptomes of cells grown on acetate,  or glucose, with expression changes for the fungus during tumour formation in planta. Guided by the transcriptional profiling, we found that acetate negatively influenced resistance to stress, promoted the formation of reactive oxygen species, triggered cell death in stationary phase and impaired virulence on maize. We also found that acetate induced mitochondrial stress by interfering with mitochondrial functions. Notably, the disruption of oxygen perception or inhibition of the electron transport chain also influenced filamentation and mating. Finally, we made use of the connections between acetate and β-oxidation to test metabolic inhibitors for an influence on growth and virulence. These experiments identified diclofenac as a potential inhibitor of virulence. Overall, these findings support the possibility of targeting mitochondrial metabolic functions to control fungal pathogens.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29753173>Comparative effects of avocado oil and losartan on blood pressure, renal vascular function, and mitochondrial oxidative stress in hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin II (Ang-II) antagonism alleviates hypertensive kidney damage by improving mitochondrial function and decreasing oxidative stress. This condition also is associated with altered renal vascular tone due to enhanced constriction by Ang-II. Thus, approaches ameliorating these events are desirable to alleviate kidney damage. Avocado oil, a source of antioxidants and , is known to improve mitochondrial function, while  has antihypertensive effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test whether avocado oil counteracts, to a similar degree as the Ang-II blocker losartan, the deleterious effects of hypertension on blood pressure, renal vascular performance, kidney mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress.Hypertensive rats induced with Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) were supplemented during 45 d with avocado oil or losartan. Vascular responses were analyzed in perfused kidney. Membrane potential, reactive oxygen species levels, and glutathione were analyzed in isolated kidney .In hypertensive rats, avocado oil decreased 21.2% and 15.5% diastolic and systolic blood pressures, respectively, and alleviated impaired renal vasodilation. Hypertension decreased membrane potential by 83.7% and augmented reactive oxygen species levels by 51% in  fueled with a complex I substrate, whereas it augmented the levels of oxidized glutathione in 48%. These alterations were normalized by avocado oil at a comparable degree to losartan.Because avocado oil mimicked the effects of losartan, we propose that the effects of avocado oil might be mediated by decreasing the actions of Ang-II on .

Cells were double-immunolabeled with α-actinin and COX IV antibodies, to label the myofibrils and , respectively, after which images were acquired via confocal microscopy. In order to determine the extent of differentiation, image analysis protocols were then used to quantify cell shape and area, as well as the degree of myofibrillar organization and intercalation of  between the myofibrils within the cells. We demonstrated that  or isoproterenol alone, or a combination of the two, induced a more elongated hESC-vCM phenotype than the untreated controls. In addition, cells treated with isoproterenol alone exhibited a similar level of myofibrillar organization as the controls, but those treated with  with/without isoproterenol exhibited a more organized (parallel) orientation of myofibrils. The combined isoproterenol/ treatment also resulted in enhanced intercalation of  between the myofibrils.

Lipids are abundant in host tissues, and fungal pathogens in the phylum basidiomycota possess both peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation pathways to utilize this potential carbon source. In addition, lipids are important signaling molecules in both fungi and mammals. In this report, we demonstrate that defects in the peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation pathways influence the growth of C. neoformans on fatty acids as well as the virulence of the fungus in a mouse inhalation model of cryptococcosis. Disease attenuation may be due to the cumulative influence of altered carbon source acquisition or processing, interference with secretion, changes in cell wall integrity, and an observed defect in capsule production for the peroxisomal mutant. Altered capsule elaboration in the context of a β-oxidation defect was unexpected but is particularly important because this trait is a major virulence factor for C. neoformans. Additionally, analysis of mutants in the peroxisomal pathway revealed a growth-promoting activity for C. neoformans, and subsequent work identified  and biotin as candidates for such factors. Overall, this study reveals that β-oxidation influences virulence in C. neoformans by multiple mechanisms that likely include contributions to carbon source acquisition and virulence factor elaboration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26108973>Ursodeoxycholyl Lysophosphatidylethanolamide modifies aberrant lipid profiles in NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Hepatic fat accumulation with disturbed lipid homoeostasis is a hallmark of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The bile  phospholipid conjugate Ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide (UDCA-LPE) is a novel anti-inflammatory agent with hepatoprotective effects in murine high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD. The aim of this work was to study changes in the hepatic lipidome due to UDCA-LPE.High fat diet mouse model, mass spectometry, RT-PCR.Hepatic lipid extracts of HFD mice were analysed by mass spectrometry. The results determined higher levels of total, saturated, mono- and diunsaturated fatty acids (FA) in HFD mice, which were decreased by UDCA-LPE predominantly by the reducing the most abundant FA species palmitic  and . Unlike other FA species, levels of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), which are composed of arachidonic  (ARA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), were increased in HFD mice upon UDCA-LPE treatment, mainly due to elevated hepatic ARA pools. Analysis of hepatic phospholipids species showed a decrease in total phosphatidylcholine (PC), especially monounsaturated PC (PUFA-PC) levels in HFD mice. Loss of total PC was reversed due to UDCA-LPE by increasing hepatic PUFA-PC pools. Gene expression analysis showed that UDCA-LPE upregulated PPARα, a key transcriptional regulator of fatty  oxidation, as well as downstream target genes CPT1α and AOX, which are crucially involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty  oxidation.UDCA-LPE modulates defective fatty  metabolism during experimental NAFLD thereby restoring altered lipid profiles in addition to its pronounced anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, UDCA-LPE may be a promising drug candidate for the management of NAFLD.© 2015 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21897120>Lipid droplet formation protects against gluco/lipotoxicity in Candida parapsilosis: an essential role of fatty  desaturase Ole1.</a></h2><p>Elevated levels of glucose and lipids can result in cellular dysfunction in eukaryotic cells ranging from Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts to human cells. Moreover, glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity can cause cell death, although the mechanism(s) for lethality is unclear. In the present study, we utilized Candida parapsilosis fatty  desaturase (OLE1) and fatty  synthase (FAS2) gene deletion mutants and wild-type (WT) yeast cells to unravel the relationship to glucose and lipid induced cell death in eukaryotic cells. Incubation of WT yeast cells with glucose led to the rapid accumulation of lipid droplets, whereas lipid droplet formation was severely impaired in yeast cells with deletion of OLE1 (ole1Δ/Δ) or FAS2 (fas2Δ/Δ). Interestingly, ole1Δ/Δ yeast cells died within hours in a 1% glucose medium without fatty  supplementation, whereas the WT or fas2Δ/Δ yeast cells did not. In glucose medium, ole1Δ/Δ yeast cells accumulated saturated fatty acids, while fas2Δ/Δ did not. Addition of saturated fatty acids (e.g., palmitic ) enhanced ole1Δ/Δ yeast cell death, whereas the addition of unsaturated fatty acids (e.g.,  or palmitoleic ) rescued cell death. Furthermore, palmitic  and glucose medium induced apopotic cell death in ole1Δ/Δ yeast cells, which was dependent on mitochondrial function. Thus, our results show that glucotoxicity is directly linked to lipotoxicity, which we demonstrate is mediated by mitochondrial function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732014>Oleate prevents palmitate-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, insulin resistance and inflammatory signaling in neuronal cells.</a></h2><p>Elevated circulating levels of saturated free fatty acids (sFFAs; e.g. palmitate) are known to provoke inflammatory responses and cause insulin resistance in peripheral tissue. By contrast, mono- or poly-unsaturated FFAs are protective against sFFAs. An excess of sFFAs in the brain circulation may also trigger neuroinflammation and insulin resistance, however the underlying signaling changes have not been clarified in neuronal cells. In the present study, we examined the effects of palmitate on mitochondrial function and viability as well as on intracellular insulin and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways in Neuro-2a and primary rat cortical neurons. We next tested whether oleate preconditioning has a protective effect against palmitate-induced toxicity. Palmitate induced both mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance while promoting the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. Oleate pre-exposure and then removal was sufficient to completely block subsequent palmitate-induced intracellular signaling and metabolic derangements. Oleate also prevented ceramide-induced insulin resistance. Moreover, oleate stimulated ATP while decreasing mitochondrial superoxide productions. The latter were associated with increased levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). Inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) attenuated the protective effect of oleate against palmitate, implicating PKA in the mechanism of oleate action. Oleate increased triglyceride and blocked palmitate-induced diacylglycerol accumulations. Oleate preconditioning was superior to docosahexaenoic  (DHA) or linoleate in the protection of neuronal cells against palmitate- or ceramide-induced cytotoxicity. We conclude that oleate has beneficial properties against sFFA and ceramide models of insulin resistance-associated damage to neuronal cells.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the pathogenic mechanism remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the levels of tyrosine 3‑monooxygenase/tryptophan 5‑monooxygenase activation protein β (YWHAB; also known as 14‑3‑3β), in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) treated with different concentrations of  (OA) were examined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. The migration of VSMCs was examined using wound‑healing and Transwell migration assays. The protein distribution of B‑cell lymphoma 2 (BCL‑2)‑associated death promoter (BAD) in VSMCs treated with OA was examined by immunofluorescence and western blot analyses. In in vivo experiments, the carotid artery morphology of rats in different groups was assessed at 14 days post‑injury by non-invasive ultrasonographic imaging and confirmed by histological staining. The expression of YWHAB was upregulated by OA in a concentration‑dependent manner in VSMCs. In the in vivo experiments, carotid stenosis was more serious among high‑FFA diabetic rats. However, silencing of YWHAB significantly alleviated carotid neointimal hyperplasia among the diabetic rats with elevated FFA levels. In addition, YWHAB silencing alleviated the migration of OA‑treated VSMCs and increased translocation of the BAD protein from the cytoplasm to the . In conclusion, the results showed that FFA‑induced upregulation of YWHAB was involved in neointimal hyperplasia by enhancing the migration of VSMCs following carotid artery injury. The inhibition of YWHAB may serve as a novel potential pharmacological target for preventing vascular restenosis following interventional therapy in diabetic individuals with high FFA levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30428625>Furanoid F- F6 Uniquely Induces NETosis Compared to C16 and C18 Fatty Acids in Human Neutrophils.</a></h2><p>Various biomolecules induce neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation or NETosis. However, the effect of fatty acids on NETosis has not been clearly established. In this study, we focused on the NETosis-inducing ability of several  molecules. We extracted the  molecules present in Arabian Gulf catfish (, Val) skin gel, which has multiple therapeutic activities. Gas chromatography⁻mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the  fraction-3 from the gel with NETosis-inducing activity contained fatty acids including a furanoid F- (F6; 12,15-epoxy-13,14-dimethyleicosa-12,14-dienoic ) and common long-chain fatty acids such as palmitic  (PA; C16:0), palmitoleic  (PO; C16:1), stearic  (SA; C18:0), and  (OA; C18:1). Using pure molecules, we show that all of these fatty acids induce NETosis to different degrees in a dose-dependent fashion. Notably, F6 induces a unique form of NETosis that is rapid and induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by both NADPH oxidase (NOX) and mitochondria. F6 also induces citrullination of histone. By contrast, the common fatty acids (PA, PO, SA, and OA) only induce NOX-dependent NETosis. The activation of the kinases such as ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) is important for long-chain fatty -induced NETosis, whereas, in F--induced NETosis, Akt is additionally needed. Nevertheless, NETosis induced by all of these compounds requires the final chromatin decondensation step of transcriptional firing. These findings are useful for understanding F-- and other fatty -induced NETosis and to establish the active ingredients with therapeutic potential for regulating diseases involving NET formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23036717>The effect of the in vitro supplementation of exogenous long-chain fatty acids on bovine sperm cell function.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate the effects of long-chain fatty acids (α-linolenic  (ALA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), linoleic  (LA),  (OA) and palmitic  (PA)) at concentrations of 10-100 µM, on extended bull spermatozoa stored in vitro for up to 7 days. Progressive linear motion (PLM), viability (Experiments 1-3), ability to penetrate artificial mucus (Experiment 1), reactive oxygen species (ROS; Experiment 2) and superoxide production (Experiment 3) were assessed. Spermatozoa maintained the ability to penetrate artificial mucus up to Day 4, irrespective of treatment. In Experiments 2 and 3, DHA and EPA had detrimental effects on PLM and viability. PA preserved PLM and viability at levels greater than the control (P<0.05), whilst keeping ROS levels to a minimum, particularly on Days 1 and 3 (P<0.01) when ROS generation peaked in other treatments. In contrast, superoxide production peaked on Day 0 (Experiment 3) and declined thereafter with no significant effect of fatty .

To identify potential drug targets a genomic study was performed in -laden primary human hepatocyte (PHH) and human hepatoma cell cultures.PHH, HuH7 and HepG2 hepatoma cell cultures were treated with lipids and/or TNFα. Intracellular  load was quantified with the ORO assay. The Affymetrix HG-U133+ array system was employed to perform transcriptome analysis. The  droplet (LD) growth and fusion was determined by fluorescence microscopy. LD associated proteins were imaged by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and confirmed by Western immunoblotting. Bioinformatics defined perturbed metabolic pathways.Whole genome expression profiling identified 227, 1031 and 571 significant regulated genes. Likewise, the combined  and TNFα treatment of PHH, HuH7 and HepG2 cell cultures revealed 154, 1238 and 278 differentially expressed genes. Although genomic responses differed among in-vitro systems, commonalities were ascertained by filtering the data for LD associated gene regulations. Among others the LD-growth and fusion associated cell death inducing DFFA like effector C (CIDEC), perilipins (PLIN2, PLIN3), the synaptosome-associated-protein 23 and the vesicle associated membrane protein 3 were strongly up-regulated. Likewise, the PPAR targets pyruvate-dehydrogenase-kinase-4 and angiopoietin-like-4 were up-regulated as was hypoxia-inducible  droplet-associated (HILPDA), flotilin and FGF21. Their inhibition ameliorates triglyceride and cholesterol accumulation. TNFα treatment elicited strong induction of the chemokine CXCL8, the kinases MAP3K8, MAP4K4 and negative regulators of cytokine signaling, i.e. SOCS2&SOCS3. Live cell imaging of DsRED calreticulin plasmid transfected HuH7 cells permitted an assessment of LD growth and fusion and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy evidenced induced LD-associated PLIN2, CIDEC, HIF1α, HILPDA, JAK1, PDK4 and ROCK2 expression.

High fat diet and alcohol are major components of the western diet. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of ethanol and fatty acids on beta-cell survival and metabolism. We treated the rat beta-cell line RINm5F with ethanol, a mixture of palmitic and  acids, or both. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by (5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate) (CM-H2DCFDA) fluorescence assay, and mitochondrial activity was assessed by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay and by determining ATP production. Cell viability was assessed with a cell counter and trypan blue exclusion, and the mode of cell death by Hoechst33342 and propidium iodide staining. With both ethanol and fatty  treatments, MTT reduction and ATP production decreased, whereas ROS production increased. Ethanol treatment had no effect on cell number, whereas fatty  treatment reduced the cell number. Cell incubation with ethanol, fatty acids, or both increased the number of Hoechst 33342-positive nuclei. However, the majority of nuclei from fatty -treated cells were stained with propidium iodide, indicating a loss of plasma membrane integrity. We conclude that both ethanol and fatty acids generate cellular oxidative stress, and affect mitochondrial function in RINm5F beta-cells. However, ethanol causes beta-cell death by apoptosis, whereas fatty acids cause cell death predominantly by necrosis. It is not known whether these results are applicable to human beta-cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639394>The Differentiation of Spinal Cord Motor Neurons is Associated with Changes of the Mitochondrial Phospholipid Cardiolipin.</a></h2><p>Motor neuron damage caused by diseases, traumatic insults or de-afferentation of the spinal cord is often incurable due to the poor intrinsic regenerative capacity. Moreover, regenerated peripheral nerves often do not reach normal functionality. Here, we investigated cardiolipin in the process of neuro-differentiation, since cardiolipin is closely linked to the mitochondrial energy supply in cells. The NSC-34 hybrid cell line, produced by fusing neuroblastoma cells with primary spinal cord motor neurons, was used, since it shares several morphological and physiological characteristics with mature primary motor neurons. Their neuro-differentiation was supported by switching from normal to differentiation medium or by fatty  supplementation. Differentiation was evaluated by measuring neurite-sprouting parameters and PPARα expression. Cellular fatty  distribution was analyzed to indicate changes in lipid metabolism during differentiation. Cardiolipin was characterized by acyl-chain composition and the distribution of molecular cardiolipin species. Both, the switch from normal to differentiation medium as well as the administration of palmitic and  promoted neuro-differentiation. Stimulated differentiation was accompanied by changes in cardiolipin content and composition. The positive correlation between neuro-differentiation and concentration of those molecular cardiolipin species containing palmitic and  implied a link between differentiation of NSC-34 cells and cardiolipin metabolism. We further demonstrated the impact of cellular lipid metabolism, and particularly cardiolipin metabolism, during and NSC-34 neuritogenesis. Thus, cardiolipin may represent a new therapeutic target for axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injuries or when axon sprouting is required to compensate for motor neuron loss in response to aging and/or disease.Copyright © 2019 IBRO.

Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are epoxy lipids derived from metabolism of arachidonic  by cytochrome P450 epoxygenases. We have previously shown that EETs trigger a protective response limiting mitochondrial dysfunction and reducing cellular death. The aim of this study was to investigate whether EET-mediated effects influence mitochondrial quality in HL-1 cardiac cells during starvation. HL-1 cells were subjected to serum- and amino  free conditions for 24h. We employed a dual-acting synthetic analog UA-8 (13-(3-propylureido)tridec-8-enoic ), possessing both EET-mimetic and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitory properties, or 14,15-EET as model EET molecules. We demonstrated that EET-mediated events significantly improved mitochondrial function as assessed by preservation of the ADP/ATP ratio and oxidative respiratory capacity. Starvation induced mitochondrial hyperfusion observed in control cells was attenuated by UA-8. However, EET-mediated events did not affect the expression of mitochondrial dynamic proteins Fis1, DRP-1 or Mfn2. Rather we observed increased levels of OPA-1 oligomers and increased mitochondrial cristae density, which correlated with the preserved mitochondrial function. Increased DNA binding activity of pCREB and Nrf1/2 and increased SIRT1 activity together with elevated mitochondrial proteins suggest EET-mediated events led to preserved mitobiogenesis.

We previously reported that Bscl2 (-/-) mice develop lipodystrophy of white adipose tissue (WAT) due to unbridled lipolysis. The residual epididymal WAT (EWAT) displays a browning phenotype with much smaller lipid droplets (LD) and higher expression of brown adipose tissue marker proteins. Here we used targeted lipidomics and gene expression profiling to analyze lipid profiles as well as genes involved in lipid metabolism in WAT of wild-type and Bscl2(-/-) mice. Analysis of total saponified fatty acids revealed that the residual EWAT of Bscl2(-/-) mice contained a much higher proportion of  18:1n9  concomitant with a lower proportion of palmitic 16:0 , as well as increased n3- polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) remodeling. The acyl chains in major species of triacylglyceride (TG) and diacylglyceride (DG) in the residual EWAT of Bscl2(-/-) mice were also enriched with dietary fatty acids. These changes could be reflected by upregulation of several fatty  elongases and desaturases. Meanwhile, Bscl2(-/-) adipocytes from EWAT had increased gene expression in lipid uptake and TG synthesis but not de novo lipogenesis. Both  and peroxisomal β-oxidation genes were also markedly increased in Bscl2(-/-) adipocytes, highlighting that these machineries were accelerated to shunt the lipolysis liberated fatty acids through uncoupling to dissipate energy. The residual subcutaneous white adipose tissue (ScWAT) was not browning but displays similar changes in lipid metabolism. Overall, our data emphasize that, other than being essential for adipocyte differentiation, Bscl2 is also important in fatty  remodeling and energy homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27807900>Lipid composition of the canine sperm plasma membrane as markers of sperm motility.</a></h2><p>The fatty  composition of the sperm membrane is an important factor involved in the overall sperm quality, including motility. However, in the canine species, the exact composition of the plasma membrane is still unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the plasma membrane lipid composition of motile sperm cells and to compare it with asthenospermic samples, as an attempt to determine possible involvements of membrane lipids in dog sperm cell motility. The sperm-rich fraction of ten mature dogs was collected, and samples were subjected to density gradient centrifugation by Percoll , in order to separate motile and asthenospermic samples. Processed semen samples were evaluated for sperm motility, plasma and acrosome membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity and susceptibility to oxidative stress. Lipid plasma membrane composition was identified by mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The motile sperm samples presented the following phospholipids in a high frequency in the plasma membrane: phosphatidylcholine 38:4 (composed of stearic and arachidonic fatty acids), phosphatidylcholine 36:1 (stearic and  fatty acids), phosphatidylethanolamine 34:4 (myristic and arachidonic fatty acids), glycerophosphatidic  36:4 (palmitic and arachidonic fatty acids), phosphatidylcholine 40:4 plasmanyl and phosphatidylcholine 40:5 plasmenyl. Furthermore, no lipid markers were found in the asthenospermic samples. Results also indicate that differences on plasma membrane composition between motile and asthenospermic samples are crucial factors for determining sperm motility, sperm functionality and susceptibility to oxidative stress. In conclusion, plasma membrane lipid composition varies considerable between motile and asthenospermic samples. Therefore, lipid markers of sperm motility can be considered, such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine plasmanyl, phosphatidylcholine plasmenyl and phosphatidic .© 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20442319>Oxidation of intramyocellular lipids is dependent on mitochondrial function and the availability of extracellular fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Obesity and insulin resistance are related to both enlarged intramyocellular triacylglycerol stores and accumulation of lipid intermediates. We investigated how lipid overflow can change the oxidation of intramyocellular lipids (ICL(OX)) and intramyocellular lipid storage (ICL). These experiments were extended by comparing these processes in primary cultured myotubes established from healthy lean and obese type 2 diabetic (T2D) individuals, two extremes in a range of metabolic phenotypes. ICLs were prelabeled for 2 days with 100 microM [(14)C] (OA). ICL(OX) was studied using a (14)CO(2) trapping system and measured under various conditions of extracellular OA (5 or 100 microM) and glucose (0.1 or 5.0 mM) and the absence or presence of mitochondrial uncoupling [carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP)]. First, increased extracellular OA availability (5 vs. 100 microM) reduced ICL(OX) by 37%. No differences in total lipolysis were observed between low and high OA availability. Uncoupling with FCCP restored ICL(OX) to basal levels during high OA availability. Mitochondrial mass was positively related to ICL(OX), but only in myotubes from lean individuals. In all, a lower mitochondrial mass and lower ICL(OX) were related to a higher cell-associated OA accumulation. Second, myotubes established from obese T2D individuals showed reduced ICL(OX). ICL(OX) remained lower during uncoupling (P < 0.001), even with comparable mitochondrial mass, suggesting decreased mitochondrial function. Furthermore, the variation in ICL(OX) in vitro was significantly related to the in vivo fasting respiratory quotient of all subjects (P < 0.02). In conclusion, the rate of ICL(OX) is dependent on the availability of extracellular fatty acids and mitochondrial function rather than mitochondrial mass.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24997274>Ca(2+)-dependent permeabilization of  and liposomes by palmitic and  acids: a comparative study.</a></h2><p>In the present work, we examine and compare the effects of saturated (palmitic) and unsaturated () fatty acids in relation to their ability to cause the Ca(2+)-dependent membrane permeabilization. The results obtained can be summarized as follows. (1)  (OA) permeabilizes liposomal membranes at much higher concentrations of Ca(2+) than palmitic  (PA): 1mM versus 100μM respectively. (2) The OA/Ca(2+)-induced permeabilization of liposomes is not accompanied by changes in the phase state of lipid bilayer, in contrast to what is observed with PA and Ca(2+). (3) The addition of Ca(2+) to the PA-containing vesicles does not change their size; in the case of OA, it leads to the appearance of larger and smaller vesicles, with larger vesicles dominating. This can be interpreted as a result of fusion and fission of liposomes.

Here, we show that PPARdelta is the PPAR subtype expressed at the highest level in insulinoma cells and rat pancreatic islets. Furthermore, PPARdelta displays high transcriptional activity and acts in pronounced synergy with retinoid-X-receptor (RXR). Interestingly, unsaturated fatty acids mimic the effects of synthetic PPARdelta agonists. Using short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown, we demonstrate that the ability of unsaturated fatty acids to stimulate fatty  metabolism is dependent on PPARdelta. Activation of PPARdelta increases the fatty  oxidation capacity in INS-1E beta-cells, enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from islets, and protects GSIS against adverse effects of prolonged fatty  exposure. The presented results indicate that the nuclear receptor PPARdelta is a fatty  sensor that adapts beta-cell mitochondrial function to long-term changes in unsaturated fatty  levels. As maintenance of mitochondrial metabolism is essential to preserve beta-cell function, these data indicate that dietary or pharmacological activation of PPARdelta and RXR may be beneficial in the prevention of beta-cell dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21563175>Interactive effects of fatty  and butyrate-induced mitochondrial Ca²⁺ loading and apoptosis in colonocytes.</a></h2><p>The combination of fish oil-derived docosahexaenoic  (DHA) (22:6; omega 3 [n-3]) and butyrate (4:0), a fiber fermentation product, synergized to enhance colonocyte apoptosis by inducing a p53-independent, oxidation sensitive, mitochondrial Ca(2+) -dependent (intrinsic) pathway.In this study, the authors probed the specificity of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  induction of Ca(2+) -dependent proapoptotic events in immortalized young adult mouse colonocytes and determined whether combinations of polyunsaturated fatty  and butyrate could trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions, thereby promoting mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload. Cultures were treated with 0 μM to 50 μM of DHA (22:6; n-3), EPA (20:5; n-3), arachidoinic  (AA) (20:4; n-6), linoleic  (18:2; n-6), or  (OA) (18:1; n-9) for a total of 72 hours with or without RU-360 (to inhibit the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter) for 30 minutes before cotreatment with butyrate (0 mM or 5 mM).Combined DHA and butyrate maximally induced apoptosis and mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca(2+) levels. By comparison, EPA, a precursor to DHA, was minimally effective. Similarly, AA and OA in combination with butyrate had no effect on mitochondrial Ca(2+) or apoptosis compared with butyrate alone. DHA with or without butyrate cotreatment minimally altered the ER stress-regulated genes DNA damage-inducible transcript 3, the CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP), and eukaryotic initiation factor 2α.The current data indicated that butyrate and DHA, but not EPA, worked in a coordinated fashion to trigger an ER-independent, Ca(2+) -dependent, intrinsic mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway in colonocytes.Copyright © 2011 American Cancer Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30733285>Recruitment of APOL1 kidney disease risk variants to lipid droplets attenuates cell toxicity.</a></h2><p>Two coding variants in the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene (termed G1 and G2) are strongly associated with increased risk of nondiabetic kidney disease in people of recent African ancestry. The mechanisms by which the risk variants cause kidney damage, although not well-understood, are believed to involve injury to glomerular podocytes. The intracellular localization and function of APOL1 in podocytes remain unclear, with recent studies suggesting possible roles in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), , endosomes, lysosomes, and autophagosomes. Here, we demonstrate that APOL1 also localizes to intracellular lipid droplets (LDs). While a large fraction of risk variant APOL1 (G1 and G2) localizes to the ER, a significant proportion of wild-type APOL1 (G0) localizes to LDs. APOL1 transiently interacts with numerous organelles, including the ER, , and endosomes. Treatment of cells that promote LD formation with  shifted the localization of G1 and G2 from the ER to LDs, with accompanying reduction of autophagic flux and cytotoxicity. Coexpression of G0 APOL1 with risk variant APOL1 enabled recruitment of G1 and G2 from the ER to LDs, accompanied by reduced cell death. The ability of G0 APOL1 to recruit risk variant APOL1 to LDs may help explain the recessive pattern of kidney disease inheritance. These studies establish APOL1 as a bona fide LD-associated protein, and reveal that recruitment of risk variant APOL1 to LDs reduces cell toxicity, autophagic flux, and cell death. Thus, interventions that divert APOL1 risk variants to LDs may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to alleviate their cytotoxic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27836699>The -targeted imidazole substituted  'TPP-IOA' affects mitochondrial bioenergetics and its protective efficacy in cells is influenced by cellular dependence on aerobic metabolism.</a></h2><p>A variety of -targeted small molecules have been invented to manipulate mitochondrial redox activities and improve function in certain disease states. 3-Hydroxypropyl-triphenylphosphonium-conjugated imidazole-substituted  (TPP-IOA) was developed as a specific inhibitor of cytochrome c peroxidase activity that inhibits apoptosis by preventing cardiolipin oxidation and cytochrome c release to the cytosol. Here we evaluate the effects of TPP-IOA on oxidative phosphorylation in isolated  and on mitochondrial function in live cells. We demonstrate that, at concentrations similar to those required to achieve inhibition of cytochrome c peroxidase activity, TPP-IOA perturbs oxidative phosphorylation in isolated . In live SH-SY5Y cells, TPP-IOA partially collapsed mitochondrial membrane potential, caused extensive fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, and decreased apparent mitochondrial abundance within 3h of exposure. Many cultured cell lines rely primarily on aerobic glycolysis, potentially making them less sensitive to small molecules disrupting oxidative phosphorylation. We therefore determined the anti-apoptotic efficacy of TPP-IOA in SH-SY5Y cells growing in glucose or in galactose, the latter of which increases reliance on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP supply. The anti-apoptotic activity of TPP-IOA that was observed in glucose media was not seen in galactose media. It therefore appears that, at concentrations required to inhibit cytochrome c peroxidase activity, TPP-IOA perturbs oxidative phosphorylation. In light of these data it is predicted that potential future therapeutic applications of TPP-IOA will be restricted to highly glycolytic cell types with limited reliance on oxidative phosphorylation.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which PS modulates lipid metabolism are largely unknown. To address this question, serial doses of PS extract (PSE) were added to 3T3-L1 cells during adipocyte differentiation. PSE (25 µg/mL) significantly attenuated adipogenesis by inhibiting lipid accumulation in addition to reducing the level of adipogenic protein and gene expression with the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Other adipocyte cell models such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts C3H10T1/2 and primary adipocytes also confirmed the anti-adipogenic properties of PSE. Next, we investigated whether PSE attenuated lipid accumulation in mature adipocytes. We found that PSE significantly suppressed lipogenic gene expression, while fatty  (FA) oxidation genes were upregulated. Augmentation of FA oxidation by PSE in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes was confirmed via a radiolabeled-FA oxidation rate experiment by measuring the conversion of [³H]- (OA) to [³H]-H₂O. Furthermore, PSE enhanced the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR), especially maximal respiration, and beige adipocyte formation in adipocytes. In summary, PSE was effective in reducing lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes through mitochondrial fatty  oxidation involved in AMPK and mitochondrial activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18321586>Synthesis and antioxidative activity of metalloporphyrins bearing 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol pendants.</a></h2><p>The novel metalloporphyrins (M=HH, Fe, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn) bearing 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol pendants as antioxidant substituents, and a long chain hydrocarbon palmitoyl group have been synthesized. The oxidation of compounds by PbO2 leads to the formation of the corresponding 2,6-di-tert-butylphenoxyl radicals studied by EPR. The activity of porphyrins in lipid peroxidation has been examined using (1) in vitro lipid peroxidation induced by tert-butylhydroperoxide in respiring rat liver , (2) in vitro lipid peroxidation in liver homogenates of Wistar strain rats, and (3) a model process of peroxidation of (Z)-octadec-9-enic ()  as a structural fragment of lipids. The activity of these compounds depends dramatically on the nature of metal and might be changed from antioxidative (M=HH, Mn, Cu, Zn) to indifferent (M=Co), and to pro-oxidative one (M=Fe). The anti- or pro-oxidative action of these compounds may be derived from the concurrence between the involvement of 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol pendants acting as radical scavengers and redox active metal center promoting oxidation processes. The results of this study suggest that the polytopic compounds combining in one molecule 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol pendants, metalloporphyrin moiety, and a palmitoyl group, are membrane active compounds and might be studied in an effort to find novel pharmaceutical agents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21948354>Connexin 43 and metabolic effect of fatty acids in stressed endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Changes in the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (∆ψ) may lead either to apoptosis or to protective autophagy. Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein, is suggested to affect mitochondrial membrane permeability. The aim of our study was to analyze Cx43 gene expression, Cx43 protein localization and mitochondrial function in the human endothelial cells stressed by dietary-free fatty acids (FFA) and TNFα. Human endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated with (10-30 uM) palmitic (PA),  (OA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA) or arachidonic (AA) acids for 24 h. TNFα (5 ng/ml) was added at the last 4 h of incubation. The Cx43 gene expression was analyzed by the quantitative real-time PCR. The Cx43 protein concentrations in whole cells and in the isolated  were measured. Changes in ∆ψ and Cx43 localization were analyzed by flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy. Generated ATP was measured by a luminescence assay. TNFα, PA and OA significantly decreased ∆ψ, while AA (P = 0.047) and EPA (P = 0.004) increased ∆ψ value. Preincubation with EPA or AA partially prevented the TNFα-induced decrease of ∆ψ. Incubation with AA resulted in up-regulation of the Cx43 gene expression. AA or PA significantly increased Cx43 protein content; however, presence of TNFα in general aggravated the negative effect of FFA. Only EPA was found to increase ATP generation in HUVECs. The fatty -specific induction of changes in Cx43 expression and protein concentration as well as the normalization of ∆ψ and increase of ATP generation seem to be the separate, independent mechanisms of FFA-mediated modulatory effect in the human endothelial cells pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646322>Ferroptosis was involved in the -induced acute lung injury in mice.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of ferroptosis in acute lung injury (ALI) mouse model induced by  (OA). ALI was induced in the mice via the lateral tail vein injection of pure OA. The histopathological score of lung, lung wet-dry weight ratio and the protein content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were used as the evaluation indexes of ALI. Iron concentration, glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in the lung tissues were measured using corresponding assay kits. The ultrastructure of pulmonary cells was observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM), and the expression level of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) mRNA was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR). Protein expression levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), ferritin and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) in lung tissues were determined by Western blot. The results showed that histopathological scores of lung tissues, lung wet-dry weight ratio and protein in BALF in the OA group were higher than those of the control group. In the OA group, the  of pulmonary cells were shrunken, and the mitochondrial membrane was ruptured. The expression level of PTGS2 mRNA in the OA group was seven folds over that in the control group. Iron overload, GSH depletion and accumulation of MDA were observed in the OA group. Compared with the control group, the protein expression levels of GPX4 and ferritin in lung tissue were down-regulated in the OA group. These results suggest that ferroptosis plays a potential role in the pathogenesis of ALI in our mouse model, which may provide new insights for development of new drugs for ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28087336>Oleate induces K channel-dependent hyperpolarization in mouse hypothalamic glucose-excited neurons without altering cellular energy charge.</a></h2><p>The unsaturated fatty , oleate exhibits anorexigenic properties reducing food intake and hepatic glucose output. However, its mechanism of action in the hypothalamus has not been fully determined. This study investigated the effects of oleate and glucose on GT1-7 mouse hypothalamic cells (a model of glucose-excited (GE) neurons) and mouse arcuate nucleus (ARC) neurons. Whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp recordings, immunoblotting and cell energy status measures were used to investigate oleate- and glucose-sensing properties of mouse hypothalamic neurons. Oleate or lowered glucose concentration caused hyperpolarization and inhibition of firing of GT1-7 cells by the activation of ATP-sensitive K channels (K). This effect of oleate was not dependent on fatty  oxidation or raised AMP-activated protein kinase activity or prevented by the presence of the UCP2 inhibitor genipin. Oleate did not alter intracellular calcium, indicating that CD36/fatty  translocase may not play a role. However, oleate activation of K may require ATP metabolism. The short-chain fatty  octanoate was unable to replicate the actions of oleate on GT1-7 cells. Although oleate decreased GT1-7 cell mitochondrial membrane potential there was no change in total cellular ATP or ATP/ADP ratios. Perforated patch and whole-cell recordings from mouse hypothalamic slices demonstrated that oleate hyperpolarized a subpopulation of ARC GE neurons by K activation. Additionally, in a separate small population of ARC neurons, oleate application or lowered glucose concentration caused membrane depolarization. In conclusion, oleate induces Kdependent hyperpolarization and inhibition of firing of a subgroup of GE hypothalamic neurons without altering cellular energy charge.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Palmitic  (PA) is the predominant circulating saturated FFA, yet its role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN) is not clear. Recently, one study suggested that mitochondrial superoxide production is related to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in diabetic mice kidneys. To elucidate the link between PA and oxidative stress and AMPK activity in DN, we compared the cultured murine podocytes exposed to PA and  (OA). Incubation of cells with 250 μM PA or OA induced a translocation of CD36, a fatty  transport protein, with intracellular lipid accumulation. PA, but not OA, induced mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H O ) generation in podocytes, as shown by enhanced fluorescence of MitoSOX Red and dichlorofluorescein (DCF), respectively. Costimulation of PA-treated cells with the H O scavenger catalase abolished the PA-induced DCF fluorescence. Only PA induced mitochondrial damage as shown by electron microscopy. The AMPK activity was determined by immunoblotting, measuring the ratio of phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK) to total AMPK. Only PA significantly increased the p-AMPK levels compared with controls. Addition of catalase to PA-treated cells did not affect the PA-stimulated p-AMPK levels. Collectively, our results indicate that PA induces mitochondrial superoxide and H O generation in cultured podocytes, which may not be directly linked to AMPK activation. Given that, PA seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of DN through lipotoxicity initiated by mitochondrial superoxide overproduction.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28403174>Exercise in vivo marks human myotubes in vitro: Training-induced increase in lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Physical activity has preventive as well as therapeutic benefits for overweight subjects. In this study we aimed to examine effects of in vivo exercise on in vitro metabolic adaptations by studying energy metabolism in cultured myotubes isolated from biopsies taken before and after 12 weeks of extensive endurance and strength training, from healthy sedentary normal weight and overweight men.Healthy sedentary men, aged 40-62 years, with normal weight (body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) were included.

Biopsy-derived cultured human myotubes after exercise showed increased total cellular  uptake (30%), oxidation (46%) and lipid accumulation (34%), as well as increased fractional glucose oxidation (14%) compared to cultures established prior to exercise. Most of these exercise-induced increases were significant in the overweight group, whereas the normal weight group showed no change in  or glucose metabolism.12 weeks of combined endurance and strength training promoted increased lipid and glucose metabolism in biopsy-derived cultured human myotubes, showing that training in vivo are able to induce changes in human myotubes that are discernible in vitro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23763576>Health effects of selected nanoparticles in vivo: liver function and hepatotoxicity following intravenous injection of titanium dioxide and Na-oleate-coated iron oxide nanoparticles in rodents.</a></h2><p>The study determined the effect of intravenous administration of acutely toxic or sub-lethal doses of Na-oleate-coated Fe3O4 (OC-Fe3O4) nanoparticles (NPs) on liver structure and function in Wistar rats, compared to titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs and saline-injected controls. The acute study, using a modified OECD 425 progressive dosing procedure, found LD50 values of 59.22 and 36.42 mg/kg for TiO2 and OC-Fe3O4 NPs, respectively. In the sub-lethal study, rats were either injected with saline (negative controls), a sub-lethal reference (0.592 mg/kgTiO2 NPs, equal to 1% of LD50 on a body weight basis) or OC-Fe3O4 NPs in doses equivalent to 0.1, 1 or 10% of the LD50, respectively (corresponding to 0.0364, 0.364 and 3.64 mg Fe3O4/kg body weight). Animals were sampled 24 h, 1, 2 and 4 weeks post-injection for adverse effects. Mitochondrial respiration was significantly increased 2 weeks after injection of 10% OC-Fe3O4 NPs compared to controls, but the effect was transient. Cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations in the liver tissue did not increase in any treatment. There were some disturbances to antioxidant enzymes after OC-Fe3O4 NPs treatment in the livers of animals 1 week post-exposure; with the most sensitive changes occurring in glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities. Lipidosis and mild necrosis with changes in sinusoid space were also observed in histological sections of the liver.

We have provided evidence that accumulation of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) is the primary reason for this energetic deficit. In this study, we have further investigated the mechanism for the NEFA-induced energetic deficit.Mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi) was measured in digitonin-permeabilized, freshly isolated proximal tubules by safranin O uptake. Addition of the potassium/proton exchanger nigericin enables the determination of the mitochondrial proton motive force (Deltap) and the proton gradient (DeltapH). ATP was measured luminometrically and NEFA colorimetrically.Tubule ATP content was depleted after hypoxia and recovered incompletely, even after full reoxygenation. Mitochondrial safranin O uptake was decreased in proximal tubules after hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R). This decrease was attenuated by delipidated bovine serum albumin (dBSA) or citrate. Addition of nigericin increased safranin O uptake of  in normoxic proximal tubules, but not in proximal tubules after H/R. Addition of dBSA restored the effect of nigericin to increase mitochondrial safranin O uptake. Addition of the NEFA oleate had the same impact on mitochondrial safranin O uptake as subjecting proximal tubules to H/R.The mechanism of the NEFA-induced energetic deficit in freshly isolated rat proximal tubules induced by H/R is characterized by impaired ATP production after full reoxygenation, impaired recovery of Deltapsi and Deltap, abrogation of DeltapH and sensitivity to citrate, consistent with involvement of the tricarboxylate carrier. The data support the concept that protonophoric uncoupling by NEFA movement on anion carriers plays a critical role in proximal tubule mitochochondrial dysfunction after H/R.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22414687>GLP1-derived nonapeptide GLP1(28-36)amide protects pancreatic β-cells from glucolipotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes, often associated with obesity, results from a deficiency of insulin production and action manifested in increased blood levels of glucose and lipids that further promote insulin resistance and impair insulin secretion. Glucolipotoxicity caused by elevated plasma glucose and lipid levels is a major cause of impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells, due to increased oxidative stress, and insulin resistance. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1), an insulinotropic glucoincretin hormone, is known to promote β-cell survival via its actions on its G-protein-coupled receptor on β-cells. Here, we report that a nonapeptide, GLP1(28-36)amide, derived from the C-terminal domain of the insulinotropic GLP1, exerts cytoprotective actions on INS-1 β-cells and on dispersed human islet cells in vitro in conditions of glucolipotoxicity and increased oxidative stress independently of the GLP1 receptor. The nonapeptide appears to enter preferably stressed, glucolipotoxic cells compared with normal unstressed cells. It targets  and improves impaired mitochondrial membrane potential, increases cellular ATP levels, inhibits cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis, and enhances the viability and survival of INS-1 β-cells. We propose that GLP1(28-36)amide might be useful in alleviating β-cell stress and might improve β-cell functions and survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26066303>Generation and esterification of electrophilic fatty  nitroalkenes in triacylglycerides.</a></h2><p>Electrophilic fatty  nitroalkenes (NO(2)-FA) are products of nitric oxide and nitrite-mediated unsaturated fatty  nitration. These electrophilic products induce pleiotropic signaling actions that modulate metabolic and inflammatory responses in cell and animal models. The metabolism of NO(2)-FA includes reduction of the vinyl nitro moiety by prostaglandin reductase-1, mitochondrial β-oxidation, and Michael addition with low molecular weight nucleophilic amino acids. Complex lipid reactions of fatty  nitroalkenes are not well defined. Herein we report the detection and characterization of NO(2)-FA-containing triacylglycerides (NO(2)-FA-TAG) via mass spectrometry-based methods. In this regard, unsaturated fatty acids of dietary triacylglycerides are targets for nitration reactions during gastric acidification, where NO(2)-FA-TAG can be detected in rat plasma after oral administration of nitro- (NO(2)-OA). Furthermore, the characterization and profiling of these species, including the generation of beta oxidation and dehydrogenation products, could be detected in NO(2)-OA-supplemented adipocytes. These data revealed that NO(2)-FA-TAG, formed by either the direct nitration of esterified unsaturated fatty acids or the incorporation of nitrated free fatty acids into triacylglycerides, contribute to the systemic distribution of these reactive electrophilic mediators and may serve as a depot for subsequent mobilization by lipases to in turn impact adipocyte homeostasis and tissue signaling events.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids protect beta-cells from the long-term negative effects of saturated fatty acids. We aimed to identify the mechanisms underlying this protective action of unsaturated fatty acids. To address the aim, insulin-secreting MIN6 cells were exposed to palmitate in the absence or presence of oleate and analyzed by using nano-LC MS/MS based proteomic approach. Important findings were validated by using alternative approaches. Proteomic analysis identified 34 proteins differentially expressed in the presence of palmitate compared to control samples. These proteins play a role in insulin processing, mitochondrial function, metabolism of biomolecules, calcium homeostasis, exocytosis, receptor signaling, ER protein folding, antioxidant activity and anti-apoptotic function. When oleate was also present during culture, expression of 15 proteins was different from the expression in the presence of palmitate alone. Most of the proteins affected by oleate are targets of the ER stress response and play a pro-survival role in beta cells such as protein folding and antioxidative defence. We conclude that restoration of pro-survival pathways of the ER stress response is a major mechanism underlying the protective effect of unsaturated fatty acids in beta-cells treated with saturated fatty acids.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated effect of SSO on mitochondrial respiration and found that SSO substantially inhibits not only LCFA oxidation, but also oxidation of flavoprotein- and NADH-dependent substrates and generation of mitochondrial membrane potential. Experiments in rat liver, heart and kidney  demonstrated a direct effect on mitochondrial respiratory chain with the most pronounced inhibition of the complex III (IC(50) 4microM SSO). The results presented here show that SSO is a potent and irreversible inhibitor of mitochondrial respiratory chain.Copyright 2010.

This has encouraged the search for strategies decreasing glucose levels and long-term improvement of redox status of glutathione, the main antioxidant counteracting mitochondrial damage. Previously, we have shown that avocado oil improves redox status of glutathione in liver and brain  from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats; however, the long-term effects of avocado oil and its hypoglycemic effect cannot be evaluated because this model displays low survival and insulin depletion. Therefore, we tested during 1 year the effects of avocado oil on glycemia, ROS levels, lipid peroxidation and glutathione status in kidney  from type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats. Diabetic rats exhibited glycemia of 120-186 mg/dL the first 9 months with a further increase to 250-300 mg/dL. Avocado oil decreased hyperglycemia at intermediate levels between diabetic and control rats. Diabetic rats displayed augmented lipid peroxidation and depletion of reduced glutathione throughout the study, while increased ROS generation was observed at the 3rd and 12th months along with diminished content of total glutathione at the 6th and 12th months. Avocado oil ameliorated all these defects and augmented the mitochondrial content of . The beneficial effects of avocado oil are discussed in terms of the hypoglycemic effect of  and the probable dependence of glutathione transport on lipid peroxidation and thiol oxidation of mitochondrial carriers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19959834>The TGL2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes an active acylglycerol lipase located in the .</a></h2><p>The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tgl2 protein shows sequence homology to Pseudomonas triacylglycerol (TAG) lipases, but its role in the yeast lipid metabolism is not known. Using hemagglutinin-tagged Tgl2p purified from yeast, we report that this protein carries a significant lipolytic activity toward long-chain TAG. Importantly, mutant hemagglutinin-Tgl2p(S144A), which contains alanine 144 in place of serine 144 in the lipase consensus sequence (G/A)XSXG exhibits no such activity. Although cellular TAG hydrolysis is reduced in the tgl2 deletion mutant, overproduction of Tgl2p in this mutant leads to an increase in TAG degradation in the presence of fatty  synthesis inhibitor cerulenin, but that of Tgl2p(S144A) does not. This result demonstrates the lipolytic function of Tgl2p in yeast. Although other yeast TAG lipases are localized to lipid particles, Tgl2p is enriched in the . The mitochondrial fraction purified from the TGL2-overexpressing yeast shows a strong lipolytic activity, which was absent in the tgl2 deletion mutant. Therefore, we conclude that Tgl2p is a functional lipase of the yeast . By analyzing phenotypic effects of TGL2-deficient yeast, we also find that lipolysis-competent Tgl2p is required for the viability of cells treated with antimitotic drug. The addition of , the product of Tgl2p-catalyzed lipolysis, fully complements the antimitotic drug sensitivity of the tgl2 null mutation. Thus, we propose that the mitochondrial Tgl2p-dependent lipolysis is crucial for the survival of cells under antimitotic drug treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26076361>Dopaminergic Neurons Respond to Iron-Induced Oxidative Stress by Modulating Lipid Acylation and Deacylation Cycles.</a></h2><p>Metal-imbalance has been reported as a contributor factor for the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson Disease (PD). Specifically, iron (Fe)-overload and copper (Cu) mis-compartmentalization have been reported to be involved in the injury of dopaminergic neurons in this pathology. The aim of this work was to characterize the mechanisms of membrane repair by studying lipid acylation and deacylation reactions and their role in oxidative injury in N27 dopaminergic neurons exposed to Fe-overload and Cu-supplementation. N27 dopaminergic neurons incubated with Fe (1 mM) for 24 hs displayed increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and elevated plasma membrane permeability. Cu-supplemented neurons (10, 50 μM) showed no evidence of oxidative stress markers. A different lipid acylation profile was observed in N27 neurons pre-labeled with [3H] arachidonic  (AA) or [3H]  (OA). In Fe-exposed neurons, AA uptake was increased in triacylglycerols (TAG) whereas its incorporation into the phospholipid (PL) fraction was diminished. TAG content was 40% higher in Fe-exposed neurons than in controls. This increase was accompanied by the appearance of Nile red positive lipid bodies. Contrariwise, OA incorporation increased in the PL fractions and showed no changes in TAG. Lipid acylation profile in Cu-supplemented neurons showed AA accumulation into phosphatidylserine and no changes in TAG. The inhibition of deacylation/acylation reactions prompted an increase in oxidative stress markers and mitochondrial dysfunction in Fe-overloaded neurons. These findings provide evidence about the participation of lipid acylation mechanisms against Fe-induced oxidative injury and postulate that dopaminergic neurons cleverly preserve AA in TAG in response to oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19747168>Uncoupling protein 1 inhibition by purine nucleotides is under the control of the endogenous ubiquinone redox state.</a></h2><p>We studied non-esterified fatty -induced uncoupling of heterologously expressed rat UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1) in yeast , as well as UCP1 in rat BAT (brown adipose tissue) . The proton-conductance curves and the relationship between the ubiquinone reduction level and membrane potential were determined in non-phosphorylating BAT and yeast . The ADP/O method was applied to determine the ADP phosphorylation rate and the relationship between the ubiquinone reduction level and respiration rate in yeast . Our studies of the membranous ubiquinone reduction level in  demonstrate that activation of UCP1 leads to a purine nucleotide-sensitive decrease in the ubiquinone redox state. Results obtained for non-phosphorylating and phosphorylating , as the endogenous ubiquinone redox state was gradually varied by a lowering rate of the ubiquinone-reducing or ubiquinol-oxidizing pathways, indicate that the endogenous ubiquinone redox state has no effect on non-esterified fatty -induced UCP1 activity in the absence of GTP, and can only regulate this activity through sensitivity to inhibition by the purine nucleotide. At a given  concentration, inhibition by GTP diminishes when ubiquinone is reduced sufficiently. The ubiquinone redox state-dependent alleviation of UCP1 inhibition by the purine nucleotide was observed at a high ubiquinone reduction level, when it exceeded 85-88%.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19830909>Phosphatidylethanolamine synthesized by three different pathways is supplied to peroxisomes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</a></h2><p>In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae three pathways lead to the formation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), namely decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine (PS) (i) by Psd1p in , and (ii) by Psd2p in a Golgi/vacuolar compartment; and (iii) synthesis via CDP-ethanolamine pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum. To determine the contribution of these pathways to the supply of PE to peroxisomes, we subjected mutants bearing defects in the respective metabolic routes to biochemical and cell biological analysis. Despite these defects in PE formation mutants were able to grow on  indicating induction of peroxisome proliferation. Biochemical analysis revealed that PE formed through all three pathways was supplied to peroxisomes. These analyses also demonstrated that selective as well as equilibrium interorganelle flux of PE appear to be equally important for cellular homeostasis of this phospholipid. Electron microscopic inspection confirmed that defects in PE synthesis still allowed formation of peroxisomes, although these organelles from strains lacking PSD1 were significantly smaller than wild type. The fact that peroxisomes were always found in close vicinity to , ER and lipid particles supported the view that membrane contact may play a role in lipid traffic between these organelles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20736083>Repercussion of a deficiency in mitochondrial ß-oxidation on the carbon flux of short-chain fatty acids to the peroxisomal ß-oxidation cycle in Aspergillus nidulans.</a></h2><p>The fungus Aspergillus nidulans contains both a mitochondrial and peroxisomal ß-oxidation pathway. This work was aimed at studying the influence of mutations in the foxA gene, encoding a peroxisomal multifunctional protein, or in the scdA/echA genes, encoding a mitochondrial short-chain dehydrogenase and an enoyl-CoA hydratase, respectively, on the carbon flux to the peroxisomal ß-oxidation pathway. A. nidulans transformed with a peroxisomal polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase produced PHA from the polymerization of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediates derived from the peroxisomal ß-oxidation of external fatty acids. PHA produced from erucic  or heptadecanoic  contained a broad spectrum of monomers, ranging from 5 to 14 carbons, revealing that the peroxisomal ß-oxidation cycle can handle both long and short-chain intermediates. While the ∆foxA mutant grown on erucic  or  synthesized 10-fold less PHA compared to wild type, the same mutant grown on octanoic  or heptanoic  produced 3- to 6-fold more PHA. Thus, while FoxA has an important contribution to the degradation of long-chain fatty acids, the flux of short-chain fatty acids to peroxisomal ß-oxidation is actually enhanced in its absence. While no change in PHA was observed in the ∆scdA∆echA mutant grown on erucic  or  compared to wild type, there was a 2- to 4-fold increased synthesis of PHA in ∆scdA∆echA cells grown in octanoic  or heptanoic . These results reveal that a compensatory mechanism exists in A. nidulans that increases the flux of short-chain fatty acids towards the peroxisomal ß-oxidation cycle when the mitochondrial ß-oxidation pathway is defective.2010 Elsevier B.V.

We have previously shown that EETs trigger a protective response limiting mitochondrial dysfunction and reducing cellular death. Considering it is unknown how EETs regulate cell death processes, the major focus of the current study was to investigate their role in the autophagic response of HL-1 cells and neonatal cardiomyocytes (NCMs) during starvation. We employed a dual-acting synthetic analog UA-8 (13-(3-propylureido)tridec-8-enoic ), possessing both EET-mimetic and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitory properties, or 14,15-EET as model EET molecules. We demonstrated that EETs significantly improved viability and recovery of starved cardiac cells, whereas they lowered cellular stress responses such as caspase-3 and proteasome activities. Furthermore, treatment with EETs resulted in preservation of mitochondrial functional activity in starved cells. The protective effects of EETs were abolished by autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7) short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or pharmacological inhibition of autophagy. Mechanistic evidence demonstrated that sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive potassium channels (pmKATP) and enhanced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) played a crucial role in the EET-mediated effect. Our data suggest that the protective effects of EETs involve regulating the autophagic response, which results in a healthier pool of  in the starved cardiac cells, thereby representing a novel mechanism of promoting survival of cardiac cells. Thus, we provide new evidence highlighting a central role of the autophagic response in linking EETs with promoting cell survival during deep metabolic stress such as starvation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19158951>Mitochondrial targeted coenzyme Q, superoxide, and fuel selectivity in endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Previously, we reported that the "antioxidant" compound "mitoQ" (mitochondrial-targeted ubiquinol/ubiquinone) actually increased superoxide production by bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cell  incubated with complex I but not complex II substrates.To further define the site of action of the targeted coenzyme Q compound, we extended these studies to include different substrate and inhibitor conditions. In addition, we assessed the effects of mitoquinone on mitochondrial respiration, measured respiration and mitochondrial membrane potential in intact cells, and tested the intriguing hypothesis that mitoquinone might impart fuel selectivity in intact BAE cells. In  respiring on differing concentrations of complex I substrates, mitoquinone and rotenone had interactive effects on ROS consistent with redox cycling at multiple sites within complex I. Mitoquinone increased respiration in isolated  respiring on complex I but not complex II substrates. Mitoquinone also increased oxygen consumption by intact BAE cells. Moreover, when added to intact cells at 50 to 1000 nM, mitoquinone increased glucose oxidation and reduced fat oxidation, at doses that did not alter membrane potential or induce cell toxicity. Although high dose mitoquinone reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, the positively charged mitochondrial-targeted cation, decyltriphenylphosphonium (mitoquinone without the coenzyme Q moiety), decreased membrane potential more than mitoquinone, but did not alter fuel selectivity. Therefore, non-specific effects of the positive charge were not responsible and the quinone moiety is required for altered nutrient selectivity.In summary, the interactive effects of mitoquinone and rotenone are consistent with redox cycling at more than one site within complex I. In addition, mitoquinone has substrate dependent effects on mitochondrial respiration, increases repiration by intact cells, and alters fuel selectivity favoring glucose over fatty  oxidation at the intact cell level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26892511> stimulates glucagon-like peptide-1 release from enteroendocrine cells by modulating cell respiration and glycolysis.</a></h2><p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a potent satiating and incretin hormone released by enteroendocrine L-cells in response to eating. Dietary fat, in particular monounsaturated fatty acids, such as  (OA), potently stimulates GLP-1 secretion from L-cells. It is, however, unclear whether the intracellular metabolic handling of OA is involved in this effect.First we determined the optimal medium for the bioenergetics measurements. Then we examined the effect of OA on the metabolism of the immortalized enteroendocrine GLUTag cell model and assessed GLP-1 release in parallel. We measured oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate in response to OA and to different metabolic inhibitors with the Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer.OA increased cellular respiration and potently stimulated GLP-1 release. The fatty  oxidation inhibitor etomoxir did neither reduce OA-induced respiration nor affect the OA-induced GLP-1 release. In contrast, inhibition of the respiratory chain or of downstream steps of aerobic glycolysis reduced the OA-induced GLP-1 release, and an inhibition of the first step of glycolysis by addition of 2-deoxy-d-glucose even abolished it.These findings indicate that an indirect stimulation of glycolysis is crucial for the OA-induced release of GLP-1.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

As a result, MT58 cells have a 50% decrease in their phosphatidylcholine (PC) level within 24 h when cultured at the nonpermissive temperature (40 degrees C). This is due to a relative rapid breakdown of PC that is not compensated for by the inhibition of de novo PC synthesis. Despite this drastic decrease in cellular PC content, cells are viable and can proliferate by addition of lysophosphatidylcholine. By [(3)H]oleate labeling, we found that the FA moiety of the degraded PC is recovered in triacylglycerol. In accordance with this finding, an accumulation of lipid droplets is seen in MT58 cells. Analysis of PC-depleted MT58 cells by electron and fluorescence microscopy revealed a partial dilation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in spherical structures on both sites of the nucleus, whereas the morphology of the plasma membrane, , and Golgi complex was unaffected. In contrast to these morphological observations, protein transport from the ER remains intact. Surprisingly, protein transport at the level of the Golgi complex is impaired. Our data suggest that the transport processes at the Golgi complex are regulated by distal changes in lipid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24184572>The turnover of glycerol and acyl moieties of cardiolipin.</a></h2><p>The dynamical behavior of  has attracted much attention, but little is known about the dynamics of mitochondrial lipids, specifically cardiolipin (CL). Here, we estimated the turnover of select molecular species of CL in mammalian cell cultures and compared it to the turnover of other lipids, including phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylinositol. Cells were labeled with myristic , 9,10-²H₂-, or D-[U-¹³C₆]-glucose and analyzed by mass spectrometry at different time points of pulse-chase experiments. The turnover of glycerol groups was monitored by specific isotopologues that carried ¹³C primarily in the glycerol carbons, whereas the turnover of acyl groups was monitored by molecular species that carried myristoyl or ²H₂-oleoyl groups. We found that the turnover of CL, but not of mitochondrial PC and PE, was substantially slower than the turnover of other cellular phospholipids. In dioleoyl-PC and dioleoyl-PE, the acyl turnover was faster than the glycerol turnover, indicating continuous deacylation and reacylation of the oleoyl residues. In contrast, the acyl turnover was similar to the glycerol turnover in tetraoleoyl-CL, suggesting that oleoyl remodeling did not take place continuously in endogenous CL. We conclude that CL, once assembled in mitochondrial membranes, remains largely inert to degradation and acyl remodeling.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

ACSs (Acyl-CoA synthetases) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the esterification of fatty acids (FA) with CoA. Recent studies suggest that ACS enzymes drive the uptake of LCFA indirectly by their enzymatic activity and could promote special metabolic pathways dependent on their localization.The only protein located at the plasma membrane which has consistently been shown to enhance FA uptake is CD36.The current study investigated whether ACSs and CD36 could regulate hepatic LCFA uptake.FATP2 and FATP4 were both localized to the ER of HuH7 and HepG2 cells as shown by double immunofluorescence in comparison to marker proteins. ACSL1 was located at  in both cell lines. Overexpression of FATP2, FATP4 and ACSL1 highly increased ACS activity as well as the uptake of [3H]- and fluorescent Bodipy-C12 (B12) fatty . Quantitative FACS analysis showed a correlation between ACS expression levels and B12 uptake. FATP2 had the highest effect on B12 uptake of all proteins tested. CD36 was mainly localized at the plasma membrane. Whereas [3H]- uptake was increased after overexpression, CD36 had no effect on B12 uptake.Uptake of LCFA into hepatoma cells can be regulated by the expression levels of intracellular enzymes. We propose that ACS enzymes drive FA uptake indirectly by esterification. Therefore these molecules are potential targets for treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or steatohepatitis (NASH).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512965>Metabolomic signatures in lipid-loaded HepaRGs reveal pathways involved in steatotic progression.</a></h2><p>A spectrum of disorders including simple steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis is described by nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). With the increased prevalence of obesity, and consequently NAFLD, there is a need for novel therapeutics in this area. To facilitate this effort, a cellular model of hepatic steatosis was developed using HepaRG cells and the resulting biochemical alterations were determined.Using global metabolomic profiling, by means of a novel metabolite extraction procedure, the metabolic profiles in response to the saturated fatty  palmitate, and a mixture of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, palmitate and oleate (1:2) were examined.We observed elevated levels of the branched chain amino acids, tricarboxylic  cycle intermediates, sphingosine and acylcarnitines, and reduced levels of carnitine in the steatotic HepaRG model with both palmitate and palmitate:oleate treatments. In addition, elevated levels of diacylglycerols and monoacylglycerols as well as altered bile  metabolism were selectively displayed by palmitate-induced steatotic cells.Biochemical changes in pathways important in the transition to hepatic steatosis including insulin resistance, altered mitochondrial metabolism, and oxidative stress are revealed by this global metabolomic approach.

Currently, there are few characterized candidates supporting the functioning of the docking mechanism of lipophorin-mediated lipid transfer. In this work we combined ligand blotting assays and tandem mass spectrometry to characterize proteins with the property to bind lipophorin at the midgut membrane of Panstrongylus megistus, a vector of Chagas' disease. We further evaluated the role of lipophorin binding proteins in the transfer of lipids between the midgut and lipophorin. The β subunit of the ATP synthase complex (β-ATPase) was identified as a lipophorin binding protein. β-ATPase was detected in enriched midgut membrane preparations free of . It was shown that β-ATPase partially co-localizes with lipophorin at the plasma membrane of isolated enterocytes and in the sub-epithelial region of the midgut tissue. The interaction of endogenous lipophorin and β-ATPase was also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Blocking of β-ATPase significantly diminished the binding of lipophorin to the isolated enterocytes and to the midgut tissue. In vivo assays injecting the β-ATPase antibody significantly reduced the transfer of [(3)H]-diacylglycerol from the midgut to the hemolymph in insects fed with [9,10-(3)H]-, supporting the involvement of lipophorin-β-ATPase association in the transfer of lipids. In addition, the β-ATPase antibody partially impaired the transfer of fatty acids from lipophorin to the midgut, a less important route of lipid delivery to this tissue. Taken together, the findings strongly suggest that β-ATPase plays a role as a docking lipophorin receptor at the midgut of P. megistus.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

PPAR alpha is involved in the regulation of in vivo triglyceride levels, presumably through its effects on fatty  and lipoprotein metabolism. Some nuclear receptors have been involved in rapid effects mediated by non-genomic mechanisms. In this paper, we report the rapid non-genomic effects of PPAR alpha ligands on the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), mitochondrial function, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and secretion of insulin in freshly isolated mouse islets of Langerhans. The hypolipidemic fibrate PPAR alpha agonist WY-14 643 decreased the glucose-induced calcium oscillations in intact islets. This effect was mimicked by the synthetic agonist GW7647 and the endogenous agonist oleylethanolamide. The WY-14 643 action was rapid in onset (5 min) and was still produced in the presence of protein and mRNA synthesis inhibitors, cycloheximide, and actinomycin-d. This suggests that it is independent of gene transcription. In addition, WY-14 623 impaired mitochondrial function, increased ROS formation and decreased insulin release. PPAR alpha is present in beta-cells, mainly in the cytosol and nucleus, with a small subpopulation localized in the plasma membrane. However, the presence of the PPAR alpha ligand effects in mice bearing a disrupted Ppar alpha gene raises the possibility that the rapid effects of the agonists in pancreatic beta-cells are independent of the receptor. We conclude that PPAR alpha agonists produce a decrease in glucose-induced [Ca2+]i signals and insulin secretion in beta-cells through a rapid, non-genomic mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18637558>Liver and heart  obtained from Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) offers high resistance to lipid peroxidation.</a></h2><p>Lipid peroxidation is generally thought to be a major mechanism of cell injury in aerobic organisms subjected to oxidative stress.

However, birds have special adaptations for preventing membrane damage caused by reactive oxygen species. This study examines fatty  profiles and susceptibility to lipid peroxidation in liver and heart  obtained from Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae). The saturated fatty acids in these organelles represent approximately 40-50% of total fatty acids whereas the polyunsaturated fatty  composition was highly distinctive, characterized by almost equal amounts of 18:2 n-6; 20:4 n-6 and 22:6 n-3 in liver , and a higher proportion of 18:2 n-6 compared to 20:4 n-6 and 22:6 n-3 in heart . The concentration of total unsaturated fatty acids of liver and heart  was approximately 50% and 60%, respectively, with a prevalence of  C18:1 n9. The rate C20:4 n6/C18:2 n6 and the unsaturation index was similar in liver and heart ; 104.33 +/- 6.73 and 100.09 +/- 3.07, respectively. Light emission originating from these organelles showed no statistically significant differences and the polyunsaturated fatty  profiles did not change during the lipid peroxidation process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21614647>Vaccenic and elaidic  equally esterify into triacylglycerols, but differently into phospholipids of fed rat liver cells.</a></h2><p>Elaidic  (trans-9-C₁₈:₁ or trans-9) is assumed to exert atherogenic effects due to its double bond configuration. The possibility that trans-9 and vaccenic  (trans-11-C₁₈:₁ or trans-11), its positional isomer, were biochemically equivalent and interchangeable compounds, was investigated by reference to their cis-isomers through esterification-related activities using rat liver cells and subcellular fractions. In hepatocytes, both trans-C₁₈:₁ were incorporated to the same extent in triacylglycerols, but trans-9 was more esterified than trans-11 into phospholipids (P < 0.05). Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity in microsomes was lower with trans-11 than with trans-9, while this activity in  was ~40% greater with trans-11 than with trans-9 (P < 0.05). Activity of 2-lysophosphatidic  acyltransferase in microsomes was of comparable extent with both trans isomers, but activity of 2-lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase was significantly greater with trans-9 than with trans-11 at P < 0.01. Lipoproteins secreted by hepatocytes reached equivalent levels in the presence of any isomers, but triacylglycerol production was more elevated with trans-11 than with trans-9 at P < 0.05. Cholesterol efflux from previously labelled hepatocytes was lower with trans-11 than with trans-9. When these cells were exposed to either trans-C₁₈:₁, the gene expression of proteins involved in fatty  esterification and lipoprotein synthesis was unaffected, which indicates that the biochemical differences essentially depended on enzyme/substrate affinities. On the whole, vaccenic and elaidic  were shown to incorporate cell phospholipids unequally, at least in vitro, which suggests they can differently affect lipid metabolic pathways in normal cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23560061>Remodeling of oxidative energy metabolism by galactose improves glucose handling and metabolic switching in human skeletal muscle cells.</a></h2><p>Cultured human myotubes have a low mitochondrial oxidative potential. This study aims to remodel energy metabolism in myotubes by replacing glucose with galactose during growth and differentiation to ultimately examine the consequences for fatty  and glucose metabolism. Exposure to galactose showed an increased [(14)C] oxidation, whereas cellular uptake of  uptake was unchanged. On the other hand, both cellular uptake and oxidation of [(14)C]glucose increased in myotubes exposed to galactose. In the presence of the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonylcyanide p-trifluormethoxy-phenylhydrazone (FCCP) the reserve capacity for glucose oxidation was increased in cells grown with galactose. Staining and live imaging of the cells showed that myotubes exposed to galactose had a significant increase in mitochondrial and neutral lipid content. Suppressibility of fatty  oxidation by acute addition of glucose was increased compared to cells grown in presence of glucose. In summary, we show that cells grown in galactose were more oxidative, had increased oxidative capacity and higher mitochondrial content, and showed an increased glucose handling.

We examined changes in fatty acids (FAs) released from isolated renal cortical  subjected to Ca(2+)-induced MPT. Exposing  to Ca(2+) stimulated mitochondrial swelling and release of FAs such as arachidonic (20:4) and docosahexenoic acids which increased 71% and 32%, respectively, and linoleic (18:2) which decreased 23% compared to controls. Stearic (18:0),  (18:1), and linoleic (18:3) acids were unchanged. To elucidate a mechanism for FA release,  were pre-treated with bromoenolactone (BEL) to inhibit Ca(2+)-independent phospholipase A(2) gamma activity (iPLA(2)γ). BEL blocked Ca(2+)-induced release of arachidonic and behenic (22:0) acids. Finally, four FAs were released in the absence of Ca(2+) in a BEL-sensitive manner, including arachidonic and docosatrienoic acids. Thus, extensive FA release occurs during Ca(2+)-induced MPT, and that mitochondrial iPLA(2)γ maintains mitochondrial arachidonic  homeostasis under both basal and Ca(2+)-induced stress conditions.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast to palmitic , unsaturated fatty acids produced significant increases in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in both cell types. Increases were fatty  specific, dose-dependent and different for each cell type. The arachidonic  effects on [Ca2+]i were higher in spermatids than in spermatocytes and persisted when residual extracellular Ca2+ was chelated by EGTA, indicating that the increase in [Ca2+]i originated from release of intracellular calcium stores. At the concentrations required for these increases, unsaturated fatty acids produced no significant changes in the plasma membrane potential of or non-specific permeability in spermatogenic cells. For the case of arachidonic , the [Ca2+]i increases were not caused by its metabolic conversion to eicosanoids or anandamide; thus we attribute this effect to the fatty  itself. As estimated with fluorescent probes, unsaturated fatty acids did not affect the intracellular pH but were able to induce a progressive decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential. The association of this decrease with reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production strongly suggests that unsaturated fatty acids induced mitochondrial uncoupling. This effect was stronger in spermatids than in spermatocytes. As a late event, arachidonic  induced caspase 3 activation in a dose-dependent manner both in the absence and presence of external Ca2+. The concurrent but differential effects of unsaturated fatty acids on [Ca2+]i and mitochondrial functions are additional manifestations of the metabolic changes that germ cells undergo during their differentiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26990649>Anacardic , Salicylic , and  Differentially Alter Cellular Bioenergetic Function in Breast Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>Anacardic  is a dietary and medicinal phytochemical that inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation and uncouples oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in isolated rat liver . Since mitochondrial-targeted anticancer therapy (mitocans) may be useful in breast cancer, we examined the effect of anacardic  on cellular bioenergetics and OXPHOS pathway proteins in breast cancer cells modeling progression to endocrine-independence: MCF-7 estrogen receptor α (ERα)+ endocrine-sensitive; LCC9 and LY2 ERα+, endocrine-resistant, and MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. At concentrations similar to cell proliferation IC50 s, anacardic  reduced ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate (OCR), mitochondrial reserve capacity, and coupling efficiency while increasing proton leak, reflecting mitochondrial toxicity which was greater in MCF-7 compared to endocrine-resistant and TNBC cells. These results suggest tolerance in endocrine-resistant and TNBC cells to mitochondrial stress induced by anacardic . Since anacardic  is an alkylated 2-hydroxybenzoic , the effects of salicylic  (SA, 2-hydroxybenzoic  moiety) and  (OA, monounsaturated alkyl moiety) were tested. SA inhibited whereas OA stimulated cell viability. In contrast to stimulation of basal OCR by anacardic  (uncoupling effect), neither SA nor OA altered basal OCR- except OA inhibited basal and ATP-linked OCR, and increased ECAR, in MDA-MB-231 cells. Changes in OXPHOS proteins correlated with changes in OCR. Overall, neither the 2-hydroxybenzoic  moiety nor the monounsaturated alky moiety of anacardic  is solely responsible for the observed -targeted anticancer activity in breast cancer cells and hence both moieties are required in the same molecule for the observed effects.

In the present study, we elucidated the protective mechanisms of OA-NO2 against renal ischemia-reperfusion injury.HK-2 cells were subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation followed by re-oxygenation (OGD/R) to mimic renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. Bax mitochondrial translocation, cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) cytosolic leakage and Akt/Gsk 3β phosphorylation were evaluated by Western blotting. Bax activation was visualized by immunocytochemistry. GW9662 and siRNA transfection were employed to examine the involvement of PPAR-γ.OGD/R injury promoted mitochondrial translocation and activation of Bax, leakage of cytochrome c and AIF, subsequent caspase-3 activation, and eventually cell apoptosis. Pre-incubation with OA-NO2 (1.25 µM, 45min) inhibited Bax activation and blocked apoptotic cascade, while the protective effects were negated by GW9662 or PPAR-γ siRNA. Moreover, OA-NO2 restored Akt and Gsk 3β phosphorylation in a PPAR-γ-dependent way.These findings suggest that OA-NO2 attenuates OGD/R-induced apoptosis by inhibiting Bax translocation and activation and the subsequent -dependent apoptotic cascade in a PPAR-γ dependent manner.© 2015 S.

It was hypothesized that NO2-FA would impact mitochondrial redox reactions to induce tissue-protective metabolic shifts in cells. Nitro- (OA-NO2) reversibly inhibited complex II-linked respiration in isolated rat heart  in a pH-dependent manner and suppressed superoxide formation. Nitroalkylation of Fp subunit was determined by BME capture and the site of modification by OA-NO2 defined by mass spectrometric analysis. These effects translated into reduced basal and maximal respiration and favored glycolytic metabolism in H9C2 cardiomyoblasts as assessed by extracellular H(+) and O2 flux analysis. The perfusion of NO2-FA induced acute cardioprotection in an isolated perfused heart ischemia/reperfusion (IR) model as evidenced by significantly higher rate-pressure products. Together these findings indicate that NO2-FA can promote cardioprotection by inducing a shift from respiration to glycolysis and suppressing reactive species formation in the post-ischemic interval.Copyright © 2015.

In this study, sixteen FAD2 and FAD2-2 protein sequences from oilseeds were analyzed by computational tools including two databases of the NCBI and EXPASY and data management tools such as SignalP, TMHMM, Psort, ProtParam, TargetP, PLACE and PlantCARE. These services were used to predict the protein properties such as molecular mass, pI, signal peptide, transmembrane and conserved domains, secondary and spatial structures. The polypeptide sequences were aligned and a neighbour-joining tree was constructed using MEGA5.1 to elucidate phylogenetic relationships among FAD2 genes. Based on the phylogenetic analysis species with high similarity in FAD2 sequence grouped together. FAD2 proteins include highly conserved histidine-rich motifs (HECGHH, HRRHH and HV[A/C/T]HH) that are located by three to five transmembrane anchors. For further investigations Sesamum indicum FAD2 was selected and analyzed by bioinformatics tools. Analysis showed no N-terminal signal peptide for probable localization of FAD2 protein in cytoplasmic organelles such as chloroplast,  and Golgi. Instead the C-terminal signaling motif YNNKL, Y(K/N)NKF or YRNKI allows FAD2 protein to selectively bind to and embed in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Creatine is a small molecule that plays a large role in energy metabolism, but since the enzyme creatine kinase is not present in the liver, the classical role in energy metabolism does not hold in this tissue. Fat accumulation in the liver can lead to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a progressive disease that is prevalent in humans. We have previously reported that creatine can directly influence lipid metabolism in cell culture to promote lipid secretion and oxidation. Our goal in the current study was to determine whether similar mechanisms that occur in cell culture were present in vivo. We also sought to determine whether dietary creatine supplementation could be effective in reversing steatosis. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a high-fat diet or a high-fat diet supplemented with creatine for 5 weeks. We found that rats supplemented with creatine had significantly improved rates of lipoprotein secretion and alterations in mitochondrial function that were consistent with greater oxidative capacity. We also find that introducing creatine into a high-fat diet halted hepatic lipid accumulation in rats with fatty liver. Our results support our previous report that liver cells in culture with creatine secrete and oxidize more , demonstrating that dietary creatine can effectively change hepatic lipid metabolism by increasing lipoprotein secretion and oxidation in vivo. Our data suggest that creatine might be an effective therapy for NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

It is generated through multiple mechanisms at various intracellular sites. Due to its chemical stability it can reach distant sites of action. However, its hydrophilicity can hamper lipid membrane passage. We therefore studied the kinetics of HO diffusion through subcellular membranes employing the HO biosensor HyPer in insulin-producing RINm5F cells. Plasma- and ER-membrane-bound HyPer sensors facing the cytosolic compartment reacted twice as fast to HO compared to sensors expressed in peroxisomes and . Overexpression of the HO-inactivating enzyme catalase in the ER-lumen and in the peroxisomes retarded the reaction time of HyPer, both localised within the peroxisomes as well as at the cytosolic surface of the ER. The unsaturated fatty   did not affect the reaction of the peroxisomal HyPer sensor to HO, while the saturated fatty  palmitic  accelerated its reaction time to HO in this organelle. The results show that the plasma-, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial membrane of insulin-producing RINm5F cells are permeable for HO. Nonetheless, the organelle membranes retard HO diffusion due to a barrier function of the lipid membrane, as documented by retarded reaction times of the intraorganellar sensors. Accelerated decomposition of HO by catalase, expressed in the peroxisomes or the ER, further retarded the HyPer sensor reaction time. The results show that redox signalling and oxidative stress mediated toxicity are crucially dependent on physicochemical membrane properties and antioxidative defence mechanisms in health and disease.Copyright © 2019.

Palmitic and  acids can induce steatosis in cultured hepatocytes. The aim of our study was to verify steatogenic and cytotoxic effects of palmitic  (PA),  (OA) and their combinations as well as their impact on functional capacity of rat primary hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were exposed to OA or PA (0.125-2 mmol/l) or their combination at ratios of 3:1, 2:1 or 1:1 at the final concentrations of 0.5-1 mmol/l. Both OA and PA caused a dose-dependent increase in triacylglycerol content in hepatocytes. PA was more steatogenic at 0.25 and 0.5 mmol/l while OA at 0.75 and 1 mmol/l. PA exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect associated with ROS production, present markers of apoptosis and necrosis and a decrease in albumin production. OA induced a damage of the cytoplasmic membrane from 1 mM concentration. Mixture of OA and PA induced lower cytotoxicity with less weakened functional capacity than did PA alone. Extent of steatosis was comparable to that after exposure to OA alone. In conclusion, OA or combination of OA with PA is more suitable for simulation of simple steatosis than PA alone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28188263>Overexpression of mitochondrial oxodicarboxylate carrier (ODC1) preserves oxidative phosphorylation in a yeast model of Barth syndrome.</a></h2><p>Cardiolipin (CL) is a diglycerol phospholipid mostly found in  where it optimizes numerous processes, including oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). To function properly, CL needs to be unsaturated, which requires the acyltransferase tafazzin. Loss-of-function mutations in this protein are responsible for Barth syndrome (BTHS), presumably because of a diminished OXPHOS capacity. Here, we show that overexpressing Odc1p, a conserved oxodicarboxylic  carrier located in the mitochondrial inner membrane, fully restores oxidative phosphorylation in a yeast model () of BTHS. The rescuing activity involves the recovery of normal expression of key components that sustain oxidative phosphorylation, including cytochrome  and electron transport chain complexes IV and III, which are strongly downregulated in  yeast. Interestingly, overexpression of Odc1p was also shown previously to rescue yeast models of mitochondrial diseases caused by defects in the assembly of ATP synthase and by mutations in the MPV17 protein that result in hepatocerebral mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome.

We hypothesised that skeletal muscle  of endurance-trained athletes have increased sensitivity for fatty  (FA)-induced uncoupling, which is driven by the mitochondrial protein adenine nucleotide translocase 1 (ANT1).Capacity for FA-induced uncoupling was measured in endurance-trained male athletes (T) and sedentary young men (UT) in an observational study and also in isolated skeletal muscle  from Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and C2C12 myotubes following small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing of ANT1. Thus, fuelled by glutamate/succinate (fibres) or pyruvate ( and myotubes) and in the presence of oligomycin to block ATP synthesis, increasing levels of oleate (fibres) or palmitate ( and myotubes) were automatically titrated while respiration was monitored. Insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp in humans and via insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in myotubes.Skeletal muscle from the T group displayed increased sensitivity to FA-induced uncoupling (p = 0.011) compared with muscle from the UT group, and this was associated with elevated insulin sensitivity (p = 0.034). ANT1 expression was increased in T (p = 0.013).  from ZDF rats displayed decreased sensitivity for FA-induced uncoupling (p = 0.008). This difference disappeared in the presence of the adenine nucleotide translocator inhibitor carboxyatractyloside. Partial knockdown of ANT1 in C2C12 myotubes decreased sensitivity to the FA-induced uncoupling (p = 0.008) and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (p = 0.025) compared with controls.Increased sensitivity to FA-induced uncoupling is associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity and is affected by ANT1 activity in skeletal muscle.

This was associated with a protection against decreased electron transfer through high potential chain in complex III related to cytochromes c + c1 loss. During Fe(2+)-induced oxidative stress, avocado oil improved the activities of complexes II and III and enhanced the protection conferred by a lipophilic antioxidant against damage by Fe(2+). Avocado oil also decreased ROS generation in Fe(2+)-damaged . Alterations in the ratio of C20:4/C18:2 fatty acids were observed in  from diabetic animals that not were corrected by avocado oil treatment, which yielded lower peroxidizability indexes only in diabetic  although avocado oil caused an augment in the total content of monounsaturated fatty acids. Moreover, a protective effect of avocado oil against lipid peroxidation was observed consistently only in control .

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we show that HDLs, not LDLs, significantly decreased the apoptosis of human Tregs in vitro, whereas they did not alter naïve or memory CD4 T cell survival. Similarly,  bound to serum albumin increased Treg survival. Tregs bound and internalized high amounts of HDL compared with other subsets, which might arise from the higher expression of the scavenger receptor class B type I by Tregs; accordingly, blocking this receptor hindered HDL-mediated Treg survival. Mechanistically, we showed that HDL increased Treg ATP concentration and mitochondrial activity, enhancing basal respiration, maximal respiration, and spare respiratory capacity. Blockade of FA oxidation by etoxomir abolished the HDL-mediated enhanced survival and mitochondrial activity. Our findings thus suggest that Tregs can specifically internalize HDLs from their microenvironment and use them as an energy source. Furthermore, a novel implication of our data is that enhanced Treg survival may contribute to HDLs' anti-inflammatory properties.Copyright © 2017 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28512781>Developmental regulation and localization of carnitine palmitoyltransferases (CPTs) in rat brain.</a></h2><p>While the brain's high energy demands are largely met by glucose, brain is also equipped with the ability to oxidize fatty acids for energy and metabolism. The brain expresses the carnitine palmitoyltransferases (CPTs) that mediate carnitine-dependent entry of long-chain acyl-CoAs into the mitochondrial matrix for β-oxidation - CPT1a and CPT2 located on the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, respectively. Their developmental profile, regional distribution and activity as well as cell type expression remain unknown. We determined that brain CPT1a RNA and total protein expression were unchanged throughout post-natal development (PND0, PND7, PND14, PND21 and PND50); however, CPT2 RNA peaked at PND 21 and remained unchanged through PND50 in all regions studied (cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, and cerebellum). Both long-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase and medium acyl-CoA dehydrogenase showed a similar developmental profile to CPT2. Acylcarnitines, generated as a result of CPT1a activity, significantly increased with age and peaked at PND21 in all brain regions, concurrent with the increased expression of enzymes involved in mitochondrial β-oxidation. The CPT system is highly enriched in vivo in hippocampus and cerebellum, relative to cortex and midbrain, and is exclusively present in astrocytes and neural progenitor cells, while absent in neurons, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. Using radiolabeled oleate, we demonstrate regional differences in brain fatty  oxidation that may be blocked by the irreversible CPT1a inhibitor etomoxir.

However, the role of diet manipulation on mitochondrial physiology is still largely unexplored. Aiming at correlating diet with alterations of mitochondrial membrane composition and bioenergetics, Wistar-Han male rats were fed for 11, 22 and 33 days with a rapeseed oil-based diet and mitochondrial bioenergetics, and membrane composition were compared at each time point with a standard diet group. Considerable differences were noticed in mitochondrial membrane lipid composition, namely in terms of fatty acyl chains and relative proportions of phospholipid classes, the modified diet inducing a decrease in the saturated to unsaturated molar ratio and an increase in the phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanolamine molar ratio. Mass spectrometry lipid analysis showed significant differences in the major species of cardiolipin, with an apparent increased incorporation of  as a result of exposure to the modified diet. Rats fed the modified diet during 22 days showed decreased hepatic mitochondrial state 3 respiration and were more susceptible to Ca(2+)-induced transition pore opening. Rapeseed oil-enriched diet also appeared to promote a decrease in hydroperoxide production by the respiratory chain, although a simultaneous decrease in vitamin E content was detected. In conclusion, our data indicate that the rapeseed oil diet causes negative alterations on hepatic mitochondrial bioenergetics, which may result from membrane remodeling. Such alterations may have an impact not only on energy supply to the cell, but also on drug-induced hepatic mitochondrial liabilities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19465148>Mitochondrial long chain fatty  beta-oxidation in man and mouse.</a></h2><p>Several mouse models for mitochondrial fatty  beta-oxidation (FAO) defects have been developed.

Using a combination of analytical, biochemical and molecular methods, we compared fibroblasts of long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase knockout (LCAD(-/-)), very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase knockout (VLCAD(-/-)) and wild type mice with fibroblasts of VLCAD-deficient patients and human controls. We show that in mice, LCAD and VLCAD have overlapping and distinct roles in FAO. The absence of VLCAD is apparently fully compensated, whereas LCAD deficiency is not. LCAD plays an essential role in the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids such as , but seems redundant in the oxidation of saturated fatty acids. In strong contrast, LCAD is neither detectable at the mRNA level nor at the protein level in men, making VLCAD indispensable in FAO.

A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with . As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and  did not alter de novo lipogenesis but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated , prepared from mouse liver, with DE particles and  also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased lipid catabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19231839>ATP acts as a regulatory effector in modulating structural transitions of cytochrome c: implications for apoptotic activity.</a></h2><p>The binding of lipids (free fatty acids as well as acidic phospholipids) to cytochrome c (cyt c) induces conformational changes and partial unfolding of the protein, strongly influencing cyt c oxidase/peroxidase activity. ATP is unique among the nucleotides in being able to turn non-native states of cyt c back to the native conformation. The peroxidase activity acquired by lipid-bound cyt c turns out to be very critical in the early stages of apoptosis. Nucleotide specificity is observed for apoptosome formation and caspase activation, the cleavage occurring only in the presence of dATP or ATP. In this study, we demonstrate the connection between peroxidase activity and -induced conformational transitions of cyt c and show how ATP is capable of modulating such interplay. By NMR measurement, we have demonstrated that ATP interacts with a site (S1) formed by K88, R91, and E62 and such interaction was weakened by mutation of E62, suggesting the selective role in the interaction played by the base moiety. Interestingly, the interactions of ATP and GTP with cyt c are significantly different at low nucleotide concentrations, with GTP being less effective in perturbing the S1 site and in eliciting apoptotic activity. To gain insights into the structural features of cyt c required for its pro-apoptotic activity and to demonstrate a regulatory role for ATP (compared to the effect of GTP), we have performed experiments on cell lysates by using cyt c proteins mutated on amino  residues that, as suggested by NMR measurements, belong to S1. Thus, we provide evidence that ATP acts as an allosteric effector, regulating structural transitions among different conformations and different oxidation states of cyt c, which are endowed with apoptotic activity or not. On this basis, we suggest a previously unrecognized role for ATP binding to cyt c at low millimolar concentrations in the cytosol, beyond the known regulatory role during the oxidative phosphorylation in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19969066>Estrogen down-regulates uncoupling proteins and increases oxidative stress in breast cancer.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress has been postulated as one of the mechanisms underlying the estrogen carcinogenic effect in breast cancer. Estrogens are known to increase mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) by an unknown mechanism. Given that uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are key regulators of mitochondrial energy efficiency and ROS production, our aim was to check the presence and activity of UCPs in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cells and tumors, as well as their relation to oxidative stress. Estrogen (1 nM) induced higher oxidative stress in the ER-positive MCF-7 cell line, showing increased mitochondrial membrane potential, H(2)O(2) levels, and DNA and protein damage compared to ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. All isoforms of uncoupling proteins were highly expressed in ER-positive breast cancer cells and tumors compared to negative ones. ROS production in  isolated from MCF-7 was increased by inhibition of UCPs with GDP, but not in  from MDA-MB-231. Estrogen treatment decreased uncoupling protein and catalase levels in MCF-7 and decreased GDP-dependent ROS production in isolated . On the whole, these results suggest that estrogens, through an ER-dependent mechanism, may increase mitochondrial ROS production by repressing uncoupling proteins, which offers a new perspective on the understanding of why estrogens are a risk factor for breast cancer.Copyright  2009 Elsevier Inc.

The perturbations to the ER that instigate ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein in response to fatty acids in hepatocytes have not been identified. The present study employed H4IIE liver cells and primary rat hepatocytes to examine the hypothesis that saturated fatty acids induce ER stress via effects on ER luminal calcium stores. Exposure of H4IIE liver cells and primary hepatocytes to palmitate and stearate reduced thapsigargin-sensitive calcium stores and increased biochemical markers of ER stress over similar time courses (6 h). These changes preceded cell death, which was only observed at later time points (16 h). Co-incubation with oleate prevented the reduction in calcium stores, induction of ER stress markers and cell death observed in response to palmitate. Inclusion of calcium chelators, BAPTA-AM or EGTA, reduced palmitate- and stearate-mediated enrichment of cytochrome c in post-mitochondrial supernatant fractions and cell death. These data suggest that redistribution of ER luminal calcium contributes to long chain saturated fatty -mediated ER stress and cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21917631>High-sucrose diet increases ROS generation, FFA accumulation, UCP2 level, and proton leak in liver .</a></h2><p>Obesity, a risk factor for insulin resistance, contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

Certain nanoparticles can induce lipid droplet formation under oxidative stress conditions. Small metallic nanoparticles such as cadmium telluride (CdTe) nanoparticles, particularly those with incompletely protected surfaces, induce oxidative stress and may inflict damages to several intracellular organelles. The objective of this study was to assess formation of lipid droplets in cells treated with CdTe nanoparticles and relate their status to cell function (mitochondrial activity and cell viability). Multicolor labeling of cellular organelles (lipid droplets and lysosomes) showed that lipid droplets formed in pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells following nanoparticle or  treatment. Some lipid droplets were found closely apposed to lysosomes suggesting possible communication between these organelles during severe oxidative stress. Combination of microscopy of living cells with cell viability assays showed that -induced lipid droplets not only serve as intracellular lipid storage sites but also play a protective role in starving stressed cells. Results from these studies suggest that -induced LD in PC12 cells are dynamic and adaptive organelles, which provide energy to starving cells and facilitate their rescue under starvation and exposure to metallic nanoparticles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20849909>Clerodendron glandulosum.Coleb extract ameliorates high fat diet/fatty  induced lipotoxicity in experimental models of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>This study evaluates the protective role of Clerodendron glandulosum.Coleb (CG) aqueous extract against high fat diet/fatty  induced lipotoxicity in experimental models of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

The major sources of dietary trans MUFA (dairy fat vs. industrially hydrogenated oils) have different isomeric profiles and thus probably different metabolic consequences. These effects may involve alterations in muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity, which may in turn promote insulin resistance if fatty  oxidation is reduced. We report that in Wistar rats, an 8 week diet enriched (4% of energy intake) in either dairy, industrial, or control MUFA did not alter insulin and glucose responses to an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (1g/kg). In C2C12 myotubes, vaccenic and elaidic acids did not modify insulin sensitivity compared with . Furthermore, the ex vivo total, mitochondrial and peroxisomal oxidation rates of [1-(14)C], vaccenic, and elaidic acids were similar in soleus and tibialis anterior rat muscle. Finally, an 8 week diet enriched in either dairy or industrial trans MUFA did not alter mitochondrial oxidative capacity in these two muscles compared with control MUFA but did induce a specific reduction in soleus mitochondrial ATP and superoxide anion production (P<0.01 vs. control). In conclusion, dietary trans MUFA of dairy or industrial origin have similar effects and do not impair muscle mitochondrial capacity and insulin sensitivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23108110>Oocyte developmental failure in response to elevated nonesterified fatty  concentrations: mechanistic insights.</a></h2><p>Elevated plasma nonesterified fatty  (NEFA) concentrations are associated with negative energy balance and metabolic disorders such as obesity and type II diabetes. Such increased plasma NEFA concentrations induce changes in the microenvironment of the ovarian follicle, which can compromise oocyte competence. Exposing oocytes to elevated NEFA concentrations during maturation affects the gene expression and phenotype of the subsequent embryo, notably prompting a disrupted oxidative metabolism. We hypothesized that these changes in the embryo are a consequence of modified energy metabolism in the oocyte. To investigate this, bovine cumulus oocyte complexes were matured under elevated NEFA conditions, and energy metabolism-related gene expression, mitochondrial function, and ultrastructure evaluated. It was found that expression of genes related to REDOX maintenance was modified in NEFA-exposed oocytes, cumulus cells, and resultant blastocysts. Moreover, the expression of genes related to fatty  synthesis in embryos that developed from NEFA-exposed oocytes was upregulated. From a functional perspective, inhibition of fatty  β-oxidation in maturing oocytes exposed to elevated NEFA concentrations restored developmental competence. There were no clear differences in mitochondrial morphology or oxygen consumption between treatments, although there was a trend for a higher mitochondrial membrane potential in zygotes derived from NEFA-exposed oocytes. These data show that the degree of mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation has a decisive impact on the development of NEFA-exposed oocytes. Furthermore, the gene expression data suggest that the resulting embryos adapt through altered metabolic strategies, which might explain the aberrant energy metabolism previously observed in these embryos originating from NEFA-exposed maturing oocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25080798>[Insulin: initiation of pool of insulin-dependent cells, targeted transfer of triglycerides and increase of kinetic parameters of oxidation of fatty acids].</a></h2><p>The insulin, to provide with energy the biological function of locomotion, formed: a) pool of phylogenetically late insulin-dependent cells; b) highly productive vector variant of transfer of saturated and mono unsaturated fatty acids only to insulin-dependent cells; c) new variant of active absorption of substrates for acquiring energy by cells--apoE/B-100-receptor endocytosis; d) transformation of all endogenically synthesized palmitic saturated fatty  in  mono saturated fatty  and e) replacement of potentially ineffective palmitic variant of formation of energy in vivo with potentially high-performance  variant of metabolism of substrates for turning out of ATP. The insulin expressed synthesis of apoE glucose carrier 4 and stearyl-KoA-desaturase. These occurrences confirm that syndrome of insulin resistance primarily is the pathology of metabolism of fatty acids and only secondary the pathology metabolism of glucose. The multi-functional fatty cells of visceral areolar tissue and specialized adipocytes of subcutaneous fat depots are phylogenetically, regulatory and functionally different cells. They are formed under development of different biological functions: the first ones under realization of biological function of trophology and second ones under realization of biological function of locomotion.

The isoprenoid farnesol (FOH) modulates  and reduces hepatic TG content in rodents. This effect involves activation of at least two nuclear receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and farnesoid X receptor. We evaluated the effects of FOH (100 μM) in a cellular model of human hepatic steatosis by loading hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells with  (OA, 0.66 mM). FOH treatment decreased OA-induced TG accumulation by ~25%. Using PCR arrays, we found that FOH treatment modulated the mRNA levels of several -metabolizing enzymes, both alone and when cells were loaded with OA. While FOH activated PPARα and the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), most of the FOH-mediated effects on -metabolizing genes could be attributed to activation of PPARα. In OA-loaded HepaRG cells, FOH increased fatty  oxidation, which was accompanied by up-regulation of PPARα target genes involved in mitochondrial fatty  oxidation, including hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase/enoyl-CoA hydratase and acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2. These effects on gene expression were lost when the cells were co-treated with the PPARα antagonist, GW6471. OA treatment alone decreased the mRNA levels of the drug-metabolizing enzymes, cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2, 2B6, and 3A4, and increased CYP2E1 expression, all of which were attenuated by FOH co-treatment. These findings show that FOH treatment increases fatty  oxidation and decreases TG accumulation in steatotic HepaRG cells, which is likely attributable to PPARα-mediated induction of mitochondrial fatty  oxidation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a pattern recognition receptor whose activation results in the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. It has been reported that TLR4 is upregulated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of NASH. This study aimed to examine the changes of TLR4 and its signaling pathways in sophocarpine's anti-inflammatory process on experimental NASH in vitro.Primary hepatocytes were isolated, and -induced steatosis model was established. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to detect the number of metabolically active  and viable cells. Immunocytochemistry analysis was applied to evaluating pro-inflammatory cytokines synthesis. Total RNA and protein were extracted for real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot detection.Enhanced expression of TLR4 was observed in -induced steatotic hepatocytes. Sophocarpine suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines synthesis and reduced the expression of TLR4 in steatotic hepatocytes. Expression of TLR4 and pro-inflammatory cytokines recovered after sophocarpine was removed. Moreover, sophocarpine restrained the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), and Extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) signaling pathways in the anti-inflammatory process.Sophocarpine could decrease the expression of TLR4 in steatotic hepatocytes and suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines synthesis.

This crucial function in oxidative tissues is altered in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Perilipin 5 (PLIN5) is a LD protein whose mechanistic and causal link with lipotoxicity and insulin resistance has raised controversies. We investigated here the physiological role of PLIN5 in skeletal muscle upon various metabolic challenges. We show that PLIN5 protein is elevated in endurance-trained (ET) subjects and correlates with muscle oxidative capacity and whole-body insulin sensitivity. When overexpressed in human skeletal muscle cells to recapitulate the ET phenotype, PLIN5 diminishes lipolysis and FA oxidation under basal condition, but paradoxically enhances FA oxidation during forskolin- and contraction- mediated lipolysis. Moreover, PLIN5 partly protects muscle cells against lipid-induced lipotoxicity. In addition, we demonstrate that down-regulation of PLIN5 in skeletal muscle inhibits insulin-mediated glucose uptake under normal chow feeding condition, while paradoxically improving insulin sensitivity upon high-fat feeding. These data highlight a key role of PLIN5 in LD function, first by finely adjusting LD FA supply to mitochondrial oxidation, and second acting as a protective factor against lipotoxicity in skeletal muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720071>Mutation of IDH1 aggravates the fatty ‑induced oxidative stress in HCT116 cells by affecting the mitochondrial respiratory chain.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence has indicated that mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) contribute to the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells; however their functions in lipid metabolism remain unknown. In the present study, the parental and IDH1 (R132H/+) mutant HCT116 cells were treated with various concentrations of  (OA) or palmitic  (PA) in the presence or absence of glucose. The results demonstrated that mutation of IDH1 exacerbated the effects of OA and PA on cell viability and apoptosis, and consistently elevated the production of reactive oxygen species in HCT116 cells, particularly in the absence of glucose. Furthermore, mutation of IDH1 inhibited the rate of fatty  oxidation (FAO), but elevated the glucose consumption in HCT116 cells. The results of immunoblotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) indicated that the expression of glucose transporter 1 was upregulated, whereas that of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 was downregulated in IDH1 mutant HCT116 cells. Although mitochondrial DNA quantification demonstrated that mutation of IDH1 had no effect on the quantity of , immunoblotting and RT‑qPCR revealed that mutation of IDH1 in HCT116 cells significantly downregulated the expression of cytochrome c (CYCS) and CYCS oxidase IV, two important components in mitochondrial respiratory chain. These results indicated that mutation of IDH1 aggravated the fatty ‑induced oxidative stress in HCT116 cells, by suppressing FAO and disrupting the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

Pig liver  were treated with n-butyl alcohol followed by Q-Sepharose chromatography, preparative gel electrophoresis, cytidine diphosphate-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol-Sepharose chromatography, and finally monolysocardiolipin-adriamycin-agarose affinity chromatography. Elution with either monolysocardiolipin or linoleoyl coenzyme A revealed a major band at 74 kDa with high specific activity (2,300 pmol/min/mg) for the acylation of monolysocardiolipin to cardiolipin using [1-(14)C]linoleoyl coenzyme A as substrate. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry analysis followed by search of the Mascot protein data base revealed peptide matches consistent with a 59-kDa protein identified as unknown human protein (GenBank(TM) protein accession number AAX93141; nucleotide accession number AC011742.3). The purified human recombinant MLCL AT-1 protein utilized linoleoyl coenzyme A > oleoyl coenzyme A > palmitoyl coenzyme A for the specific acylation of monolysocardiolipin to cardiolipin. Expression of MLCL AT-1 in HeLa cells increased mitochondrial monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase activity and [1-(14)C]linoleic  incorporated into cardiolipin, whereas RNA interference knockdown of MLCL AT-1 in HeLa cells resulted in reduction in enzyme activity and [1-(14)C]linoleic  incorporated into cardiolipin. In contrast, expression of MLCL AT-1 in HeLa cells did not alter [1-(14)C] or [1-(14)C]palmitate incorporation into cardiolipin indicating in vivo specificity for the remodeling of cardiolipin with linoleate. Finally, expression of MLCL AT-1 in Barth syndrome lymphoblasts, which exhibit cardiolipin levels 20% that of normal lymphoblasts, increased mitochondrial monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase activity, [1-(14)C]linoleic  incorporation into cardiolipin, cardiolipin mass, and succinate dehydrogenase (mitochondrial complex II) activity compared with mock-transfected Barth syndrome lymphoblasts.
