We found that in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the most common form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, patients with higher body mass index had significantly longer overall survival. Patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma usually have worse outcomes than those with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Nonetheless, the association between body mass index at diagnosis and survival in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma remains unclear.This retrospective study included 411 peripheral T-cell lymphoma patients from January 2010 to July 2017. Patients were stratified by body mass index into low body mass index (<24.0 kg/) and high body mass index (≥24.0 kg/) groups. We mainly used Cox modelling and the Kaplan-Meier method to evaluate survival and other variables.Multivariate analysis demonstrated that body mass index, international prognostic index and triglyceride level were independent prognostic factors of overall survival. Interestingly, patients with high body mass index had significantly longer overall survival (P < 0.01), with 69% of patients alive at 3 years versus 43% in the low body mass index group. Cox analysis showed reduced mortality in the high body mass index group compared with the low body mass index group (hazard ratio = 0.511, 95% CI, 0.309-0.846, P = 0.009). In addition, patients with high body mass index and low international prognostic index had the longest overall survival (P < 0.001).High body mass index at the time of diagnosis was associated with improved overall survival in Chinese peripheral T-cell lymphoma patients.© The Author(s) 2019.

Household food insecurity was self-reported using a validated 2-item screener. Dietary intake was assessed using the 26-item National Cancer Institute's Dietary Screener Questionnaire, and dietary behaviors were assessed using a household survey. Data were analyzed using multilevel statistical models, including tests for interaction by age, sex, and race/ethnicity.Children from food-insecure households had higher BMI-z (β: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.21), waist circumference (β: 0.91 cm; 95% CI: 0.18, 1.63), odds of being overweight or obese (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.34), consumed more sugar from sugar-sweetened beverages (β: 1.44 g/d; 95% CI: 0.35, 2.54), and less frequently ate breakfast (β: -0.28 d/wk; 95% CI: -0.39, -0.17) and dinner with family (β: -0.22 d/wk; 95% CI: -0.37, -0.06) compared to children from food-secure households. When examined by age groups (4-9 and 10-15 y), significant relationships were observed only for older children. There were no significant interactions by sex or race/ethnicity.Household food insecurity was associated with higher child adiposity-related outcomes and several nutrition behaviors, particularly among older children, 10-15 y old.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608397>Sleep apnoea among Australian Aboriginal and Non- Aboriginal patients in the Northern Territory of Australia- a comparative study.</a></h2><p>Australian Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islanders (ATSI) are noted to have a higher burden of chronic health conditions. However, there is a paucity of data on Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) in this population. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the clinical and polysomnographic (PSG) characteristics of ATSI and non- ATSI adult patients who underwent diagnostic PSG between 2011 and 2015. There were a total of 3078 patients. Of the total, 403 (13%) were of ATSI origin. Amongst those of ATSI origin, 61% were male and 39% females, while amongst the non-ATSI cohort, 66% were males. The median age was 47.8 years in ATSI and 51.5 years in the non- ATSI cohort. In the combined cohort, body mass index was >30 kg/ ( 61%), hypertension (14.4%), diabetes ( 17.8%) and heart disease ( 23.3%). The ATSI patients had higher rates of class III  (27 v 15%), hypertension (26 v 14%), cardiac disease (34 v 23%) and diabetes (37 v 17%). Among all the study participants, the PSG confirmed 83.7% of the patients had an apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI) more than 5/hour, mild (AHI 5-15/hour) in (28.4%), moderate (AHI 15-30/hour) in (22.3%), and severe (AHI > 30/hour) in (33.0%). Among the ATSI patients, 46% had severe OSA. The median total AHI value was higher in the ATSI population (25, IQR: 11 - 58) compared to the non-ATSI (17, IQR: 7 - 36), and in rural/remote population (19, IQR: 8 - 42) compared to urban (17, IQR: 7 - 37). This trend was similar for NREM (Non Rapid Eye Movement)-AHI and REM (Rapid Eye Movement) AHI scores, although statistically significant difference was found only with ATSI status. In the combined cohort the probability of (OR= 1.62, 95% CI: 1.32-2.00, p<0.001) of severe OSA was 62% higher in individual with hypertension , however, when stratified by ATSI status, the association was only significant in the non-ATSI population (OR=1.53 95% CI: 1.21 - 1.94, p<0.001). The odds of severe AHI was also significantly associated with heart disease (1.37; 95%CI: 1.14,1.63, p<0.001), diabetes (1.74; 95%CI: 1.43,2.10; p<0.001) and smoking (1.28; 95%CI: 1.09,1.50, p=0.0023) in the overall study cohort. In both ATSI and non- ATSI patients, BMI, neck circumference, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset and respiratory arousal index were significantly higher and independently associated with severe AHI.© Sleep Research Society 2019.

We hypothesized that diet quality is determined by eating behaviors, but evidence in women with  is lacking. We evaluated diet quality and eating behavior in 56 women with  (mean ± SEM, 36.7 ± 0.7 kg/, 46% White, 50% nulliparous) early in pregnancy (14.9 ± 0.1 weeks). Diet quality was objectively assessed with food photography over six days and defined by Healthy Eating Index. Eating behaviors were assessed by validated questionnaires. Women reported consuming diets high in fat (38 ± 1% of energy) and the HEI was considered "poor" on average (46.7 ± 1.3), and for 71% of women. Diet quality was independently associated with education level ( 0.01), food cravings ( < 0.01), and awareness towards eating ( 0.01). Cravings for sweets and fast foods were positively correlated with respective intakes of these foods ( < 0.01 and  0.04, respectively), whereas cravings for fruits and vegetables did not relate to diet intake. We provide evidence of the determinants of poor diet quality in pregnant women with . Based on this observational study, strategies to improve diet quality and pregnancy outcomes are to satisfy cravings for healthy snacks and foods, and to promote awareness towards eating behaviors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31465465>Association of frequency of television watching with overweight and  among women of reproductive age in India: Evidence from a nationally representative study.</a></h2><p>For women of reproductive age, overweight and  are an established risk factor for several medical complications. To address the increasing rate of  in India through public health awareness programs, the association between common behaviors and overweight and  needs to be investigated. This study aims to determine whether there is any association between the frequency of television watching and overweight and  among women of reproductive age (15-49 years) in India.This is a cross-sectional study that utilized data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), which utilized a nationally representative sample from all 29 states and 7 union territories of India. The survey itself followed a two-staged stratified random sampling technique. The primary outcome of interest was overweight (23.0 kg/ to <27.5 kg/) and  (≥27.5 kg/), measured by using the Asian body mass index cut-off. The major explanatory variable was the frequency of television watching, measured in days per week. Sample weight of NFHS-4 was adjusted during the analysis. Multilevel ordered logistic regression was conducted to identify the factors associated with overweight and . To show the strength of association, both the unadjusted Crude Odds Ratio (COR) and the Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) were reported with a 95% confidence interval (CI). A p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant.The analysis included weighted data from 644,006 Indian women of reproductive age (15-49 years). Among the respondents, 33.5% were overweight or obese (BMI ≥23.0 kg/). The prevalence of overweight and  increased with age (p-value <0.0001) and almost half of the women aged 35-49 years were either overweight or obese (48.6%). The prevalence was significantly higher among those living in an urban area compared to a rural area (urban 46.5% vs. rural 26.5%; p-value <0.001). The prevalence of overweight and  increased with the frequency of watching television and was the highest among the individuals who reported watching television almost every day (p-value <0.0001). Women watching television almost every day had 24% (AOR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.21-1.26; p-value <0.001) increased odds of being overweight and obese compared to their counterparts who never watched television.This study found that the likelihood of being overweight and obese significantly increased with the frequency of watching television; likely due to physical inactivity during leisure time. Further studies should examine the physical activity and food habits of this target group. Public health promotion programs in India should raise awareness regarding the harmful effects of the sedentary lifestyle associated with watching television.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141526>Maternal pre-pregnancy weight status modifies the influence of PUFAs and inflammatory biomarkers in breastmilk on infant growth.</a></h2><p>Human breastmilk contains pro- and anti-inflammatory compounds and hormones that can influence infant growth. However, little is known about the specific interrelationships between these compounds and whether their effects on infant growth may be influenced by pre-pregnancy weight status.The purpose of this novel, prospective cohort study was to assess the interrelationships between pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), hormones (insulin, leptin) and PUFAs (n-6, n-3) in blood and breastmilk in early postpartum between women with normal BMI (Group 1, n = 18; 18.5<BMI≤24.9 kg/) and with overweight/ (Group 2, n = 15; BMI≥25.0 kg/) before pregnancy to determine if these components correlated to infant growth measures at age 4-8 weeks.Participants were robustly phenotyped along with their infants at 4-8 weeks postpartum. TNF-α, IL-6, insulin, leptin, and n-3 and n-6 PUFAs measured in blood and breastmilk and compared between pre-pregnancy BMI groups and with infant weight, length, head circumference and % fat mass.Group 1 women had higher serum leptin (p<0.01) and breastmilk leptin (p<0.001) compared to Group 2. Other inflammatory markers, hormones, and total n-6, n-3 and n-6/n-3 ratio PUFAs were similar between pre-pregnancy BMI groups. No relationships were observed between whey inflammatory markers, hormones, PUFAs and growth measures in infants born to Group 2 women. However, TNF-α was positively related and, IL-6, leptin, insulin, total n-6, n-3 and n-6/n-3 PUFAs in whey breastmilk were negatively correlated to infant growth measures in infants born to Group 1 women (p<0.01).Pro-inflammatory qualities of breastmilk were associated with infant growth measures regardless of maternal pre-pregnancy BMI. However, infants born to women with overweight or  demonstrated less responsive growth to breastmilk contents. More studies are needed to assess longitudinal effects of this impact.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31407155>Conversion of Laparoscopic Roux en Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) to Single Anastomosis Duodenal Switch (SADS).</a></h2><p>The surgical management of weight regain following RYGB remains controversial. Simpler modifications such as endoscopic suturing and banding the bypass have had variable efficacy. Distalization of the bypass has resulted in a high risk of malabsorption-related complications as reported by Amor et al. (Obes Surg. 27(1):273-274, 2017); Borbély et al. (Obes Surg. 27(2):439-444, 2017); Thomopoulos et al. (Surg Laparosc Endosc Percutan Tech. 0(0):1, 2018); and Tran et al. (Obes Surg. 26(7):1627-1634, 2016). Conversion to a procedure such as duodenal switch (DS) or SADS with greater average weight loss would be logical but is technically challenging and is related to a high complication rate especially with the reformation of the stomach. In this video, we present the technique that we have adapted to make this complex case reproducible minimizing operative risk.A 49-year-old female weighing 154 kg (BMI 57 kg/) with sleep apnea disease underwent a laparoscopic RYGB in 2009. She had an initial weight loss of 47 kg but had complete recidivism with a weight of 151 kg (BMI 56 kg/). Upper gastrointestinal (barium swallow study) and esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed no evidence of fistula, with a normal pouch diameter and length with stoma size of 2 cm. Blood test showed no significant micro/macronutrient deficiencies. With super morbid  refractory to RYGB, it was our belief that conversion to SADS was the best alternative.We introduced a subcostal camera trocar with Optiview and we observed epiploic adherences to the previous anastomosis. We placed an additional trocar to remove adhesions in the re-operative field. We measured the 300 cm of the small bowel proximal to the ileocecal valve. We next divided the antecolic Roux limb from the gastric remnant preserving the left gastric artery and divided the pouch proximal to the gastrojejunal anastomosis. We identified and mobilized the remnant stomach preserving the 8 lowest branches of the right gastroepiploic artery. After reaching the angle of His, we were able to separate the remnant and the pouch. The pouch was reshaped using a 42Fr bougie for guidance. A gastrostomy was made and a matching opening was created near the lesser curvature on the remnant. We then began gastrogastric anastomosis. First, the posterior layer was done and then the bougie was placed through into the remnant. The sleeve and fundic resection was done. The bougie was replaced by an oral gastric tube and the anterior layer of the anastomosis completed. This was tested with methylene blue. We next divided the duodenum postpylorus, preserving the right gastric artery. We performed and tested a hand-sewn duodeno-ileal anastomosis with a common limb length of 300 cm. There were no intra- or postoperative complications and the patient was discharged after 2 days.We believe that this video shows a reproducible technique for this complex anastomosis. Preservation of the distal epiploics makes the gastro-gastric anastomosis safer but requires direct dissection of the duodenum.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161219>Intuitive eating is associated with weight loss after bariatric surgery in women.</a></h2><p>Although the data on eating behavior after bariatric surgery are substantial, data on "intuitive eating" are lacking.The aim of this study was to evaluate the link between intuitive eating and weight loss after bariatric surgery.This cross-sectional study used a self-administered questionnaire freely available on social networks and targeted women who had undergone bariatric surgery. Intuitive eating was evaluated with the Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2). The 3 questionnaire subscores (Eating for Physical Rather than Emotional Reasons, Reliance on Hunger and Satiety Cues, and Unconditional Permission to Eat) were also analyzed. The relation between IES-2 scores and the relative variation in body mass index [BMI (in kg/)] was assessed with linear regression models. Adjusted β (βAdj) and standardized β $( {{\rm{\beta }}_{{\rm{Adj}}}^{{\rm{STD}}}} )$ were reported.We analyzed the responses of 401 women with a mean age of 39 ± 11 y, a mean preoperative BMI of 45.5 ± 7.9, and a mean current BMI of 30.5 ± 7. The mean relative BMI loss was 32.7 ± 12.9%, and the mean IES-2 score was 3.3 ± 0.6. The total IES-2 score was associated with the relative BMI loss, with ∼2.6% BMI loss for each 1-point increase in the IES-2 score [PAdj = 0.007; βAdj = -2.57 (95% CI: -4.44, -0.70); ${\rm{\beta }}_{{\rm{Adj}}}^{{\rm{STD}}}$= -0.12] after adjusting for elapsed time since surgery and type of surgery. Eating for Physical Rather than Emotional Reasons was the subscore most strongly associated with BMI change after adjustment [PAdj = 0.002; βAdj = -2.08 (95% CI: -3.37, 0.79); ${\rm{\beta }}_{{\rm{Adj}}}^{{\rm{STD}}}$ = -0.14].This study highlights a significant association between intuitive eating and BMI decrease after bariatric surgery. Furthermore, eating behaviors changed with increasing time since surgery. An intuitive nutritional approach may be complementary with bariatric surgery in the postoperative phase, which should prompt complementary prospective studies to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic education programs centered on intuitive eating in the postoperative period.© American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168571>Body mass index, weight-adjusted immunosuppression and the risk of acute rejection and infection after kidney transplantation: a cohort study.</a></h2><p>Body mass index (BMI) is associated with patient outcomes after kidney transplantation. We hypothesized that immunosuppression (IS) dosing is a contributing factor.Using Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant registry data, we included all adult kidney-only transplant recipients over 2000-14 treated with prednisolone, mycophenolate and tacrolimus/cyclosporin (n = 7919). The exposure was BMI and the outcomes were time to: (i) acute rejection, (ii) fatal infection, (iii) cancer and (iv) graft; and (v) patient survival. We modelled BMI and IS dosing (in quartiles) as time-varying covariates in extended Cox models.Compared with a BMI of 25 kg/, a BMI of 35 was associated with acute rejection after adjusting for demographics and comorbidities [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-1.49]. This association virtually disappeared after correcting for IS (aHR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.93-1.29). A BMI of 35 was non-significantly associated with fewer fatal infections (aHR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.66-1.25), but this reversed after adjusting for IS (aHR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.03-2.28). Results for cancer were not significantly altered after adjusting for IS. Results for lower BMI were similarly not significantly altered though generally associated with worse outcomes.Our findings show that the associations between high BMI, acute rejection and fatal infection after kidney transplantation were significantly altered after correcting for IS suggesting that relative under-dosing of obese patients may partially explain these associations.© The Author(s) 2019.

Interventions or prevention programs aiming at the pre-pregnancy period should be considered. However, how the woman's weight change before pregnancy affects fetal growth is not known. We investigated the association between weight change over the year before pregnancy and birth weight.We used the inclusion data of 16,395 women from the ELFE French national birth cohort, a nationally representative cohort in which infants were enrolled at birth with their families in 2011. Maternal weight change was self-reported and classified into 3 groups: moderate weight variation or stable weight, weight loss > 5 kg, and weight gain > 5 kg or both weight loss and gain > 5 kg. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the association between pre-pregnancy weight change and a birth weight z-score calculated according to the French Audipog reference, adjusted for a large set of maternal characteristics. The analyses were stratified by maternal body mass index (BMI) at conception (<25 versus ≥25 kg/) and adjusted for BMI within these categories. We used the MacKinnon method to test the mediating effect of gestational weight gain (GWG) on these associations. Mother's mean age was 30.5 years, 87% were born in France, and 26% had overweight or . For women in either BMI category at conception, GWG was more than 2 kg higher, on average, for women with weight loss before pregnancy than for women with stable weight or moderate weight variation. For women with BMI < 25 kg/ at conception, birth weight was significantly higher with weight loss than stable weight before pregnancy (β = 0.08 [95% CI 0.02; 0.14], p = 0.01), and this total effect was explained by a significant mediating effect through GWG. For women with BMI ≥ 25 kg/ at conception, birth weight was not associated with pre-pregnancy weight loss during the year before pregnancy. Mediation analysis revealed that in these women, the direct effect of pre-pregnancy weight loss that would have resulted in a smaller birth weight z-score (β = -0.11 [95% CI -0.19; -0.03], p = 0.01) was cancelled out by the GWG. The mediating effect of GWG was even higher when weight loss resulted from a restrictive diet in the year before pregnancy. Weight gain before pregnancy was not associated with birth weight. Although we included a large number of women and had extensive data, the only potential cause of pre-pregnancy weight loss that was investigated was dieting for intentional weight loss. We have no information on other potential causes but did however exclude women with a history of pre-pregnancy chronic disease. Another limitation is declaration bias due to self-reported data.Health professionals should be aware that GWG may offset the expected effect of weight loss before conception on fetal growth in overweight and obese women. Further studies are required to understand the underlying mechanisms in order to develop weight-control interventions and improve maternal periconceptional health and developmental conditions for the fetus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576962>Agreement between software programmes of body composition analyses on abdominal computed tomography scans of obese adults.</a></h2><p>A large number of studies have used abdominal computed tomography (CT) to quantify body composition, and different software programmes have been used to perform these analyses. Thus, this comparison is important to enable researchers to know the performance of more accessible software.Fifty-four abdominal CT scans of obese (BMI 30 to 39.9 kg/), sedentary adults (24-41 years) patients from a Brazilian single center were selected. Two software programs were compared: Slice-O-Matic (Tomovision, Canada) version 5.0 and OsiriX version 5.8.5. The body composition analysis were segmented using standard Hounsfield unit (HU) (adipose tissue: -190 to +30 and skeletal muscle: -29 to +150) and measured at the mid third lumbar vertebra (L3) level on a slice showing both transversal processes. Bland-Altman limits of agreement analyses were used to assess the level of agreement between Slice-O-Matic and OsiriX.A total of fifty-four participants were evaluated, with majority women (69%), mean of age 31.3 (SD 6.5) years and  grade I most prevalent (74.1%). The agreement, in Bland-Altman analysis, between Slice-O-Matic and OsiriX analisys for the muscle mass tissue, visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue were excellent (≥ 0.954) with P-values < 0.001.These findings show that Slice-O-Matic and OsiriX softwares agreement in measurements of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and sarcopenia diagnosis in obese patients, suggesting good applicability in studies with body composition in this population and clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31439046>The effect of morbid  (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m) on functional outcome and complication rate following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: a case-control study.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the functional outcomes and complication rates of patients in short-term and midterm follow-up period when medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA)-applied patients were grouped according to BMI values.One hundred four patients (mean age 60.2 ± 7.4 (range, 49-80)) to whom medial UKA was applied between 2011 to 2016 with a minimum of 2 years follow-up were grouped as normal and overweight (less than 30 kg/m), obese (30-34.9 kg/m) and morbidly obese (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m) according to their BMI. The postoperative Knee Society Scores (KSS), functional Knee Society Scores (fKSS), Oxford Knee Scores (OKS), visual analogue scale (VAS) and range of motion (ROM) results and complication rate of these groups were compared statistically. The implant positioning of the patients requiring revision was analysed according to the Oxford radiological criteria.The average BMI of 104 patients was 34.4 (range, 22-56.9). Twenty-six (25%) of these were normal or overweight, 40 (38.5%) were obese and 38 (36.5%) were morbidly obese. However, in these BMI groups, there was no significant difference between the preoperative VAS, postoperative VAS and VAS score changes among these three groups (p > 0.05). The postop KSS, f KSS and OKS were significantly poorer in the morbidly obese group by 75.2, 70.5 and 33.1, respectively. Furthermore, amount of ROM changes (4.2°) were significantly poorer in the morbidly obese group (p < 0.05). Complications including eminence fractures, insert dislocations, tibial component collapses and superficial infections developed in 10 patients (9.6%). Six of them (60%) were morbidly obese, and four of them (40%) were obese. Furthermore, 11 (10.6%) of the patients required revision. Eight (72.7%) of the patients were morbidly obese, and three (27.3%) of them were obese.We concluded that morbid  is an independent risk factor for functional outcomes and implant survival after UKA. However, it is possible to obtain excellent results for obese and overweight patients with good planning and correct surgical technique. Morbid obese patients should be preoperatively informed about poor functional outcome and high complication rate. Treatment of morbid  before UKA surgery may be a good option.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31256194>Association between regional body fat and cardiovascular disease risk among postmenopausal women with normal body mass index.</a></h2><p>Central adiposity is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, even among people with normal body mass index (BMI). We tested the hypothesis that regional body fat deposits (trunk or leg fat) are associated with altered risk of CVD among postmenopausal women with normal BMI.We included 2683 postmenopausal women with normal BMI (18.5 to <25 kg/) who participated in the Women's Health Initiative and had no known CVD at baseline. Body composition was determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Incident CVD events including coronary heart disease and stroke were ascertained through February 2017. During a median 17.9 years of follow-up, 291 incident CVD cases occurred. After adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical risk factors, neither whole-body fat mass nor fat percentage was associated with CVD risk. Higher percent trunk fat was associated with increased risk of CVD [highest vs. lowest quartile hazard ratio (HR) = 1.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33-2.74; P-trend <0.001], whereas higher percent leg fat was associated with decreased risk of CVD (highest vs. lowest quartile HR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.89; P-trend = 0.008). The association for trunk fat was attenuated yet remained significant after further adjustment for waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio. Higher percent trunk fat combined with lower percent leg fat was associated with particularly high risk of CVD (HR comparing extreme groups = 3.33, 95% CI 1.46-7.62).Among postmenopausal women with normal BMI, both elevated trunk fat and reduced leg fat are associated with increased risk of CVD.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Blood pressure was measured at baseline and after the follow-up. Anthropometry indices included body mass index (BMI), body adiposity index (BAI), the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), the waist-to-hip ratio (WHpR), and waist and hip circumferences (WC and HC). Logistic regression was employed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) per standard deviation (SD) increment. The operating characteristic analysis was used to derive the best cut-off value for each index.Among original 6504 participants, 2450 subjects who had no cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and HTN at baseline were revisited, and 542 (22.1%) new cases of HTN were detected. There were minimal differences between most indices in the adjusted models; however, the best HTN predictors were BMI (OR per SD 1.32; 95% CI 1.12-1.56) and almost equally WC (1.35; 1.13-1.60) in men and WC (1.20; 1.04-1.39) in women. As a binary predictor, BMI with a cut-off point of 24.9 kg/ in men (1.91; 1.40-2.62) and WC with a cut-off point of 98 cm in women (1.57; 1.17-2.10) were the best in adjusted models. WC, WHpR, and WHtR were significantly associated with an increased risk of HTN only in participants whose weight was normal (BMI, 18.5-24.9 kg/).Therefore, BMI in men and WC in women were the best predictors of HTN, both as continuous and binary factors at their appropriate cut-off points.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620342>Mortality and Body Mass Index in Burn Patients: Experience from a Tertiary Referral Burn Center in Southern Iran.</a></h2><p>The role of  has been widely studied as a determinant factor of increasing mortality in surgical patients. In this study we aimed to investigate the association of mortality determinants with  classification and BMI score in burn patients admitted to a tertiary referral center in Southern Iran.In this retrospective cross-sectional study, medical profiles of burn patients admitted from 2016 to 2017 were obtained from Amiralmomenin Burn Hospital, a tertiary referral burn center affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. Demographic, and clinical characteristics as well as patient outcomes were recorded to determine prognostic factors in fatal burns based on anthropometric measurements.Among 101 patients who were enrolled in this study including 73 males and 28 females, mean age was 34.85±12.04 years, total burn surface area (TBSA) was 37.37 (10.50%), BMI was 25.46±5.33 kg/m and hospital stay was 22.28±13.62 days. Overall mortality rate was 24.7% with 25 expired cases. Logistic regression demonstrated significant association of older age, male gender, and greater TBSA with mortality. However, difference in mortality rate in patients with BMI of 25 kg/ (27.4%) in comparison to patients with BMI<25 kg/ (18%) did not reach statistical significance.Although patients with higher BMI had increased mortality rate following burn injury, this finding showed no significant association.

We aimed to assess maternal and surgical predictors of surgical site skin infection (SSSI) in very severely obese women and to undertake an exploratory evaluation of clinical outcomes in women with a supra-panniculus transverse compared to an infra-panniculus transverse skin incision.Using a retrospective cohort design, case-records were reviewed of very severely obese women with a singleton pregnancy delivered by caesarean between August 2011 and December 2015 (n = 453) in two maternity hospitals in Scotland. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors for SSSI. Outcomes were compared between women who had a supra-panniculus transverse compared to infra-panniculus transverse skin incision.Lower maternal age was predictive of SSSI, with current smoking status and longer wound open times being marginally significant. Maternal BMI, suture method and material demonstrated univariate associations with SSSI but were not independent predictors. Women with a supra-panniculus transverse skin incision were older (32.9 (4.4), vs. 30.6 (5.7), p = 0.002), had higher BMI (49.2 (7.1), vs. 43.3 (3.3), p<0.001), shorter gestation at delivery (days) (267.7 (14.9), vs. 274.8 (14.5), p<0.001) and higher prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (42.6% vs. 21.9%, p = 0.002). SSSI rates did not differ between supra-panniculus transverse (13/47; 27.7%) and infra-panniculus transverse (90/406; 22.2%; p = 0.395) skin incisions.SSSI rates are high in very severely obese women following caesarean section, regardless of location of skin incision.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31393183>Visceral fat is associated with cirrhotic portal vein thrombosis.</a></h2><p>: Central , due to the accumulation of visceral fat(VF), is one of the main risk factors for venous thrombosis. The aim of this study was to determine if VF may be a risk factor for development of portal vein thrombosis(PVT) in cirrhotic patients.: A total of 214 cirrhotic patients at the outpatient clinic were consecutively included, undergoing an anthropometric evaluation, blood tests and bioimpedance.: Median MELDscore was10. Prior liver decompensation occurred in 44.9% of patients and 35.6% of patients had large esophageal varices. Mean body mass index was 28.7 Kg/ (39.3%were obese) and mean waist circumference(WC) was 103.8 cm. A 7.5% of patients had PVT at the time of inclusion. PVT was more frequent in males(93.8 vs. 68.2%, p = 0.03). Patients with PVT had a higher WC(111.9 vs. 103.2 cm, p = 0.02) and VF (17.1 vs. 14.5, p = 0.04). PVT was also more frequent in patients with prior decompensation (81.3 vs. 41.9%, p < 0.01) and with large esophageal varices(62.5 vs. 33.3%, p = 0.02). In the simplified multivariate analysis, PVT was independently associated with the presence of portal hypertension(OR 13, 95%CI 1.6-108.3, p = 0.02) and VF(OR 1.2, 95%CI 1.03-1.3, p = 0.01).: VF was independently associated with PVT in cirrhotic patients.

However, storage duration and use of anticoagulant K3-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) may interfere with these measurements.The aim of this study was to measure the variability of MPV in obese patients following exposure to EDTA.A total of 160 patients were divided into 3 groups according to body mass index (BMI; normal: <25 kg/; overweight: 25-30 kg/; obese: >30 kg/). Blood was collected in sterile tubes containing K3-EDTA. Blood cell counts were obtained using the CELL-DYN Ruby system immediately and 1, 2, and 3 h after collection.MPV was found to be directly proportional to BMI. With the addition of EDTA, MPV was increased in the first hour after collection; MPV then decreased to levels that were lower than initial baseline measurements.K3-EDTA use alters platelet volume. The time from collection to measurement should be standardized to reduce MPV value variance. MPV should be determined within 1 h of collection to avoid anticoagulant use-related interference.© 2019 S.

We also tested in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) whether the interindividual variation in OXT serum levels might be explained by genetic variation.The OXT concentration was increased in subjects with elevated BMI and positively correlated with WHR, waist circumference, and triglyceride levels. The OXT concentration in subjects with BMI <25 kg/ was significantly lower (n = 256; 78.6 pg/mL) than in subjects with a BMI between 25 and 30 kg/ (n = 314; 98.5 pg/mL, P = 6 × 10-6) and with BMI >30 kg/ (n = 137; 106.4 pg/mL, P = 8 × 10-6). OXT levels were also positively correlated with plasma glucose and insulin and were elevated in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (P = 4.6 × 10-3). Heritability of OXT was estimated at 12.8%.

A total of 543 primary school children aged 5-10 years (204 boys and 339 girls) in Gampaha District, Sri Lanka, were included in the analysis. The nutritional statuses of thinness, normal, overweight, and  for children and mothers were defined according to WHO growth references and body mass index. Maternal education, household equivalent income, and maternal employment were used as socioeconomic status indicators. The proportion of child thinness and overweight was 19.3% and 13.4%, respectively, and that of maternal overweight (body mass index ≥ 25 kg/) was 36.5%. A positive correlation was found between maternal body mass index and the child's body mass index for age z-score in older boys and younger girls. A multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that lower education of mothers posed a higher association with child thinness (adjusted odds ratio = 2.33, 95% confidence interval: 1.08-5.00). Mothers with overweight and  were less likely to have a child with thinness (adjusted odds ratio = 0.30, 95% confidence interval: 0.16-0.58). Maternal employment status and household equivalent income were not significantly, but marginally, associated with child overweight and .

Breakfast consumption, and the individual means and the intra-individual standard deviation (isd) of time at first intake of the day, duration of daily intake window and midpoint of daily intake window were collected via six 24-h recalls and examined in relation to BMI, waist circumference (WC) and inflammation (glycoprotein acetyl (GlycA)). Compared with consuming breakfast on all six recalls, linear regression models showed those who consumed breakfast on 4 or 5 of the days had a 1·29 (95 % CI 0·19, 2·38) and 1·64 (95 % CI 0·12, 3·16) kg/ higher BMI; no association was found for consuming breakfast ≤3 d. At 1 h later, the average time of first intake was associated with a 0·44 (95 % CI 0·04, 0·84) kg/ higher BMI. A 1-h increase in the isd of first intake was associated with a 1·12 (95 % CI 0·49, 1·75) kg/ higher BMI; isd in duration and midpoint of intake window were significant prior to additional adjustment for isd in the first intake.

Methods A historical cohort study was performed on 16,609 women who delivered singleton babies in a 5-year period (2013-2017). Data were retrieved from the Cruces Perinatal Database (CPD) and only women whose prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) was known were included. Women were categorized according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification: normal weight (BMI 20-24.9 kg/) and  (BMI ≥ 30 kg/). Obstetric, perinatal and neonatal outcomes were compared, and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using the normal-weight group as the reference. Results Compared to women of normal weight (n = 9778), obese women (n = 2207) had a higher risk of preeclampsia (aOR 2.199, 95% CI: 1.46-3.29), rectovaginal group B streptococcus colonization (aOR 1.299, 95% CI: 1.14-1.47), induction of labor (aOR 1.593, 95% CI: 1.44-1.75), cesarean section (aOR 2.755, 95% CI: 2.46-3.08), cesarean section in women with a history of cesarean delivery (aOR 1.409, 95% CI: 1.03-1.92), fetal weight ≥4000 g (aOR 2.090, 95% CI: 1.803-2.422) and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (aOR 1.341, 95% CI: 1.12-1.59).

The present study was designed to investigate the anti-, anti-inflammatory and toxic activities of celastrol-loaded nanomicelles (nano-celastrol) in diet-induced obese mice. Celastrol was loaded into PEG-PCL nanoparticles, yielding nano-celastrol with optimal size, spherical morphology, good bioavailability, slower peak time and clearance in mice. Nano-celastrol (5 or 7.5 mg/kg/d of celastrol) was administered into diet-induced obese C57BL/6 N male mice for 3 weeks. As result, higher dose nano-celastrol reduced body weight and body fat mass in an equally effective manner as regular celastrol, although lower dose nano-celastrol showed less activity. Similarly, nano-celastrol improved glucose tolerance in mice equally well as regular celastrol, whereas higher dose nano-celastrol improved the response to insulin. As for macrophage M1/ polarization in liver, nano-celastrol reduced the expression of macrophage M1 biomarkers (e.g., IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, iNOS) in a dose-dependent manner and marginally increased the expression of macrophage  biomarkers (e.g., Arg-1, IL-10). Moreover, celastrol could cause anus irritation and disturb intestinal and colonic integrity, whereas nano-celastrol did not cause any injury to mice. Collectively, nano-celastrol represents a translatable therapeutic opportunity for treating diet-induced  in humans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A food frequency questionnaire and anthropometric measurements were conducted in 2018. Principal component analysis was used to identify dietary patterns. Logistic regression was applied to compare the risks for overweight (BMI >=24 kg/),  (BMI >=28 kg/), and central  (waist circumference >=80 cm for women and >=85 cm for men) across quintiles of dietary pattern scores after controlling for gender, age, education, medical insurance, smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity.This study identified three major dietary patterns: an urban pattern characterized by high intake of vegetables, tubers/roots, and refined carbohydrates; a western pattern characterized by sugary drinks, snacks, and desserts; and a pastoral pattern characterized by tsamba (roasted Tibetan barley), Tibetan cheese, and buttered/milk tea. Subjects in the highest quintile of urban pattern scores were more likely to be overweight (OR=2.58, 95% CI 1.48-4.49) (p-for-trend=0.001), obese (2.94, 1.57-5.49) (p-for-trend=0.001), and centrally obese (1.94, 1.12-3.36) (p-for-trend=0.019) compared to those in the lowest quintile with confounders controlled. The western dietary pattern was positively associated with overweight (p-for-trend=0.037).

Furthermore, we evaluated the potential of these metabolites to act as predictive markers for GDM.This was a prospective study investigating overweight and obese [prepregnancy BMI (in kg/) ≥25 and >30, respectively] pregnant women (prepregnancy median BMI: 28.5; IQR: 26.4-31.5; n = 357). Fasting serum samples were analyzed with a targeted NMR approach in early pregnancy (median: 14.3 weeks of gestation). GDM was diagnosed on the basis of a 2-h, 75-g oral-glucose-tolerance test at a median of 25.7 weeks of gestation.In early pregnancy, 78 lipid metabolites differed in women who later developed GDM (n = 82) compared with those who remained healthy (n = 275) (ANCOVA, adjusted for confounding factors and corrected for multiple comparisons; false discovery rate <0.05). Higher concentrations of several-sized VLDL particles and medium- and small-sized HDL particles, and lower concentrations of very large-sized HDL particles, were detected in women developing GDM. Furthermore, concentrations of amino acids including 2 branched-chain amino acids, isoleucine and leucine, and GlycA, a marker for low-grade inflammation, were higher in women who developed GDM. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the most predictive marker for GDM was a higher concentration of small-sized HDL particles (AUC: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.77; P < 0.001).We identified a distinct early pregnancy metabolomic profile especially attributable to small HDL particles in women developing GDM. The aberrant metabolic profile could represent a novel way to allow early identification of this most common medical condition affecting pregnant women.

However, despite a "complicated medical history," a systematic, organized approach in  medicine utilizes a personalized-tailored treatment strategy coupled with understanding of the disease state, presence of comorbidities, contraindications, side effects, and patient preferences. Here, we present the case of a young patient with Class 3b severe , several -related complications, and extensive psychological history. Through synergistic and additive treatments (behavioral/nutritional therapy combined with anti- pharmacotherapy and concurrent enrollment in our bariatric surgery program), the patient was able to achieve significant -30.5% total body weight loss with improvement of metabolic parameters. Though these results are not typical of all patients, we must emphasize the need to encompass all available anti- therapies (lifestyle, pharmacotherapy, medical devices, bariatric surgery in monotherapy or combination) in cases of refractory or severe , as we do similarly for other disease modalities such as refractory hypertension or poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes that requires robust escalation in therapy.Copyright © 2019 Srivastava and Apovian.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31130535>Retrospective Analysis of Population Demographic Characteristics, Medical Interventions, and Resource Use at a Medical Student-Run Clinic on the Texas-Mexico Border.</a></h2><p>The study's purpose was to assess population demographics and resource utilization of the Medical Student Run Clinic, which provides primary care services to patients in El Paso, Texas along the Texas-Mexico border.A retrospective cross-sectional chart review was performed on 760 patients evaluated at the medical student-run clinic between 2013 and 2016.

Gastric bypass was performed in 1 966 patients, gastric sleeve resection in 122 (17 of these later underwent duodenal switch) and duodenal switch in 56 patients. All patients were operated laparoscopically, and four procedures were converted to laparotomy. Median hospitalisation time was two days (range 1-78). Complications were registered in 209 patients, 75 of whom had severe complications (grade ≥ IIIb on the Clavien-Dindo classification system). Patients with a body mass index ≥ 50 kg/ had a higher incidence of complications (12.5 % vs 8.9 %). Altogether 67 patients underwent further surgery. Six patients died, two of whom more than 30 days after the operation.

However, only few data exist on immunoassay interference for other hormones.A 36-year-old woman with  (body mass index, 31 kg/) had regularly attended our endocrine unit for type 2 diabetes therapy. When she was included as a control subject in a study for  management, detailed laboratory testing was performed, including PTH. In the absence of clinical symptoms, she presented with normal calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D levels. However, the PTH levels were >5000 ng/L. These results were obtained using the Roche Elecsys electrochemiluminescence assay. Repeated measurements with this assay (mouse antibody) led to the same findings. However, using an Euroimmun assay (goat antibody), the exact PTH values were measured at 18.0 ng/L. After pretreatment with a heterophilic antibody blocking reagent, the results of the Roche assay had decreased to a normal level. This phenomenon was explained by the detection of human anti-mouse antibodies in the proband's serum.In cases of prolactin immunoassay interference, endogenous antibodies will bind to the hormone in vivo, resulting in complexes of a high molecular weight that are less efficiently cleared by the kidneys and, thus, accumulate in the blood. In contrast, the PTH values >5000 ng/L detected in our subject most likely had resulted from the specific interference of the human anti-mouse antibodies present in the proband's serum with the assay antibody, resulting in artificial stimulation of the Roche assay detection system ex vivo.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31499381>The attenuating effects of pyridoxamine on adipocyte hypertrophy and inflammation differ by adipocyte location.</a></h2><p>It is known that receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and its ligands accumulate in the fat tissues of obese individuals, and RAGE ligands induce M1 macrophage polarization, which in turn induces inflammation. We evaluated the effect of pyridoxamine on RAGE ligand accumulation and M1 polarization in the visceral, subcutaneous, and perivascular fat tissues of Sprague-Dawley rats fed a high fat diet (HFD). Pyridoxamine reduced HFD-induced weight gain, attenuated adipocyte size increases, RAGE ligand accumulations, RAGE-RAGE ligands binding, decreased macrophage M1 polarization and increased  polarization in visceral fat tissues, but not in subcutaneous tissues. Pyridoxamine induced glyoxalase 1 (Glo-1) expression in visceral fat in the HFD group, whereas pyridoxamine induced Glo-1 expression in perivascular fat tissues was no higher than that observed in the normal fat diet (NFD) controls. In vitro, pyridoxamine suppressed the release of RAGE ligands from AGE treated macrophages, but non-significantly attenuated RAGE ligands release in AGE treated adipocytes. Pyridoxamine was found to suppress weight increases and M1 polarization, and to increase Glo-1 expression through the RAGE pathway in perivascular and visceral fat tissues of HFD-induced obese rats.

We quantified impact of body mass index (BMI) on the risk of SSI for a variety of surgical procedures.We included 2012-2017 data from the Dutch national surveillance network PREZIES on a selection of frequently performed surgical procedures across different specialties. Patients were stratified into 5 categories: underweight (BMI, &lt;18.5 kg/), normal weight (BMI, 18.5-25), overweight (BMI, 25-30), obese (BMI, 30-40) and morbidly obese (BMI, ≥40). Multilevel log binomial regression analyses were performed to assess the effect of BMI category on the risk of superficial, deep (including organ-space) and total SSI.Of the 387,919 included patients (ranging from 2,616 for laparoscopic appendectomy to 119,834 for total hip prosthesis), 3,676 (1%) were underweight, 116,778 (30%) had normal weight, 154,339 (40%) were overweight, 104,288 (27%) had , and 8,838 (2%) were morbidly obese. A trend of increasing risk of SSI when BMI increased from normal to morbidly obese was observed for almost all surgery types. The increase was most profound in surgeries with clean wounds, with relative risks for morbidly obese patients ranging up to 7.8 (95% CI, 6.0-10.2) for deep SSI in total hip prosthesis.

Mean bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were calculated to assess the precision of multiple methods of estimating V.Of 241 patients included in the study sample, 159 (66.0%) had a BMI of 40.0-49.9 kg/, and 82 (34.0%) had a BMI of ≥50.0 kg/. The median (5th, 95th percentile) weight of patients was 136 (103, 204) kg, and baseline characteristics were similar between BMI groups. The mean ± S.D. V was lower in patients with a BMI of 40.0-49.9 kg/ than in those with a BMI of ≥50.0 kg/ (72.4 ± 19.6 L versus 79.3 ± 20.6 L, p = 0.009); however, body size poorly predicted V in regression analyses (R2 < 0.20). A fixed estimate of V (75 L) or use of 0.52 L/kg by total body weight yielded similar bias and error in this population.Results of the largest analysis of vancomycin V in class III  to date indicated that use of a fixed V value (75 L) and use of a TBW-based estimate (0.52 L/kg) for estimation of vancomycin V in patients with a BMI of ≥40.0 kg/ have similar bias.

This has been demonstrated clearly in the community setting; less clear is the effect of age on this relationship in the inpatient setting.Retrospective analysis of 22,903 electronic records for patients discharged from two large public hospitals in South Australia between January 2015 and September 2018 inclusively. Records were retained if the patient's height and weight had been recorded during the admission, BMI was between 10-99 kg/ and it was the patient's first admission during that time. Patients were grouped by BMI (<18.5 kg/ ("underweight"), 18.5-24.9 kg/ ("normal weight"), 25-29.9 kg/ ("overweight"), >30 kg/ ("obese")) and age (18-59 years, 60-79 years, > 80 years); for each group we measured the relative stay index (RSI) (actual length of stay divided by predicted length of stay), death in hospital and composite adverse outcome after discharge (unplanned readmission within 30 days and/or death within 30 days).Underweight patients across all age groups generally experienced significantly poorer outcomes compared to those not underweight. In those aged 18-59 years there were no significant differences in outcomes between the normal weight, overweight and obese groups. In those aged 60-79 years overweight patients had a significantly reduced risk of RSI > 2 compared to those of normal weight (p=0.014), and both overweight and obese patients had a significantly reduced risk of adverse outcome after discharge when compared to those of normal weight (p=0.028 and p=0.009 respectively). In those aged 80 years or older, both overweight and obese patients had a significantly reduced risk of adverse outcome after discharge when compared to those of normal weight (p=0.028 and p=0.013 respectively), and obese patients had a significantly reduced risk of inpatient mortality and RSI >2 when compared to those of normal weight (p=0.027 and p=0.037 respectively).A BMI > 25 kg/ in older patients is associated with reduced risk of prolonged admission, inpatient mortality and adverse outcomes following discharge. This adds to growing evidence that age-specific BMI guidelines are required for adults because the healthiest BMI in the older hospital patient is seemingly not in the range 18.5-24.9 kg/.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31466550>Eating Behaviors in Healthy Young Adult Twin Pairs Discordant for Body Mass Index.</a></h2><p>We aimed to study the eating behavioral traits that associate with body mass index (BMI) among BMI-discordant twin pairs. This cross-sectional study examined self-reported eating behaviors in 134 healthy young adult twin pairs (57 monozygotic [MZ] and 77 same-sex dizygotic [DZ]), of whom 29 MZ and 46 DZ pairs were BMI discordant (BMI difference ≥ 3 kg/). In both MZ and DZ BMI-discordant pairs, the heavier co-twins reported being less capable of regulating their food intake optimally than their leaner co-twins, mainly due to 'frequent overeating'. Furthermore, the heavier co-twins reported augmented 'disinhibited eating', 'binge-eating scores' and 'body dissatisfaction'. The twins agreed more frequently that the heavier co-twins (rather than the leaner co-twins) ate more food in general, and more fatty food, in particular. No significant behavioral differences emerged in BMI-concordant twin pairs. Overeating - measured by 'frequent overeating', 'disinhibited eating' and 'binge-eating score' - was the main behavioral trait associated with higher BMI, independent of genotype and shared environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474632>[Role of Angiogenesis and Chronic Inflammation in Fat Hypertrophy in NASH Pathology].</a></h2><p>Tissue expansion and chronic inflammation in adipose tissue (AT) are closely related to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) pathology. Angiogenesis is initiated by the detachment of pericytes (PCs) from vessels in AT. This process is necessary for the development of AT in . The detachment is caused by excessive platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) derived from M1-macrophages (Mφ) infiltrating obese AT. On the other hand, AT of tamoxifen-induced systemic PDGF receptor-β knockout mice showed decreased detachment of PCs from vessels in , thereby attenuating hypertrophy of AT mediated by neoangiogenesis, resulting in protection from the development of chronic AT inflammation and systemic insulin resistance. The selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) inhibitor eplerenone (Ep) suppresses chronic inflammation in fat and the liver, improves glucose and lipid metabolism, and inhibits body weight and fat mass gain in mice fed a high-fat diet. As a novel mechanism, Ep increases energy expenditure and suppresses fat accumulation, thereby controlling the polarity of visceral AT Mφ from inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory  dominant. In addition, Ep directly inhibits the activation of signals 1 and 2 of NLRP3-inflammasomes in Mφ, which is an inflammatory mechanism closely involved in the development of NASH. Thus, we propose novel therapeutic approaches to NASH. Inhibition of PDGF receptor-β signaling prevents AT hypertrophy by regulating AT angiogenesis, and MR inhibitors directly suppress chronic inflammation in the AT and liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174214>Fiber Intake Predicts Weight Loss and Dietary Adherence in Adults Consuming Calorie-Restricted Diets: The POUNDS Lost (Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies) Study.</a></h2><p>The effects of dietary composition on weight loss are incompletely understood. In addition to energy intake, fiber intake, energy density, macronutrient composition, and demographic characteristics have all been suggested to contribute to weight loss.The primary aim of this analysis was to assess the role of dietary fiber as a predictor of weight loss in participants who consumed calorie-restricted diets (-750 kcal/d from estimated energy needs) for 6 mo, using data from the POUNDS Lost (Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies) Study-a randomized trial that examined the effects of calorie-restricted diets varying in macronutrient composition on weight loss in adults.Data were randomly partitioned to a training data set (70%) in which the effects of fiber and other weight-loss predictors were identified using adjusted Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and model averaging. The retained predictors were then fit on the testing data set to assess predictive performance.Three hundred and forty-five participants (53.9% female) provided dietary records at baseline and 6 mo. Mean ± SD age and BMI for the full sample was 52.5 ± 8.7 y and 32.6 ± 3.9 kg/, respectively. Mean ± SD (99% CI) weight change at 6 mo for the full sample was -7.27 ± 5.6 kg (-8.05, -6.48 kg). The final, best fit model (R2 = 0.41) included fiber, energy density, fat, age, adherence, baseline weight, race, and changes from baseline in carbohydrate, fiber, PUFA, and MUFA intake, but the most influential predictor was fiber intake ($\hat{\beta }$ = -0.37; P < 0.0001). In addition, fiber was strongly associated with adherence to the macronutrient prescriptions (P < 0.0001). Interactions between race and adherence, age, baseline weight, carbohydrate, energy density, and MUFAs were also retained in the final model.Dietary fiber intake, independently of macronutrient and caloric intake, promotes weight loss and dietary adherence in adults with overweight or  consuming a calorie-restricted diet.

Unfortunately, existing programs have had limited long-term success of lessening insulin resistance, the key physiological risk indicator for T2D. Underlying psychosocial factors, particularly depressive symptoms, have been related to insulin resistance, independent of BMI or body fat. Preliminary evidence indicates that mindfulness-based programs show promise for intervening with depression and T2D; yet, this approach is novel and data in adolescents are scarce.The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the benefits, and potential underlying mechanisms, of a mindfulness-based intervention in adolescents at-risk for T2D with depressive symptoms and (2) to consider clinical implementation with this specific, psychologically, and medically at-risk adolescent population.The research team conducted a case study report. The setting was an outpatient therapy clinic and research laboratory at a university.The participant was a 16-y-old female with elevated depressive symptoms, , and insulin resistance, and a family history of T2D.The intervention was a 6-wk mindfulness-based group program. The key outcomes were patterns of change in trait mindfulness, depression, and insulin resistance in the course of a 1-y follow-up. Secondary outcomes were patterns of change in reported-overeating patterns and cortisol awakening response.Compared with her scores at baseline, the participant displayed a pattern of increased trait mindfulness, decreased depressive symptoms, and lessening of insulin resistance immediately following the group program and at 1 y. BMI and body fat were stable. There was a remission in reported-overeating and a pattern of declining cortisol awakening response 1 y later. Participant feedback on the intervention was generally positive but also provided potential modifications to strengthen acceptability and effectiveness.The current case results suggest that teaching mindfulness skills to adolescent girls at risk for T2D with depressive symptoms may offer distinctive advantages for treating depression and T2D risk. Clinical implications for increasing the success of implementing mindfulness-based programs in this population include a focus on promotion of social connectedness within the group, implementation of strategies to increase adherence to home practice activities, and the use of facilitation techniques to promote concrete understanding of abstract mindfulness concepts. Future, adequately powered clinical trial data are required to test therapeutic mechanisms and recommended adaptations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332776>Interventions for preventing  in children.</a></h2><p>Prevention of childhood  is an international public health priority given the significant impact of  on acute and chronic diseases, general health, development and well-being. The international evidence base for strategies to prevent  is very large and is accumulating rapidly. This is an update of a previous review.To determine the effectiveness of a range of interventions that include diet or physical activity components, or both, designed to prevent  in children.We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO and CINAHL in June 2015. We re-ran the search from June 2015 to January 2018 and included a search of trial registers.Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet or physical activity interventions, or combined diet and physical activity interventions, for preventing overweight or  in children (0-17 years) that reported outcomes at a minimum of 12 weeks from baseline.Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk-of-bias and evaluated overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We extracted data on adiposity outcomes, sociodemographic characteristics, adverse events, intervention process and costs. We meta-analysed data as guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and presented separate meta-analyses by age group for child 0 to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, and 13 to 18 years for zBMI and BMI.We included 153 RCTs, mostly from the USA or Europe. Thirteen studies were based in upper-middle-income countries (UMIC: Brazil, Ecuador, Lebanon, Mexico, Thailand, Turkey, US-Mexico border), and one was based in a lower middle-income country (LMIC: Egypt). The majority (85) targeted children aged 6 to 12 years.Children aged 0-5 years: There is moderate-certainty evidence from 16 RCTs (n = 6261) that diet combined with physical activity interventions, compared with control, reduced BMI (mean difference (MD) -0.07 kg/m, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.14 to -0.01), and had a similar effect (11 RCTs, n = 5536) on zBMI (MD -0.11, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.01). Neither diet (moderate-certainty evidence) nor physical activity interventions alone (high-certainty evidence) compared with control reduced BMI (physical activity alone: MD -0.22 kg/m, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.01) or zBMI (diet alone: MD -0.14, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.04; physical activity alone: MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.13) in children aged 0-5 years.Children aged 6 to 12 years: There is moderate-certainty evidence from 14 RCTs (n = 16,410) that physical activity interventions, compared with control, reduced BMI (MD -0.10 kg/m, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.05). However, there is moderate-certainty evidence that they had little or no effect on zBMI (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.02). There is low-certainty evidence from 20 RCTs (n = 24,043) that diet combined with physical activity interventions, compared with control, reduced zBMI (MD -0.05 kg/, 95% CI -0.10 to -0.01). There is high-certainty evidence that diet interventions, compared with control, had little impact on zBMI (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.01) or BMI (-0.02 kg/, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.06).Children aged 13 to 18 years: There is very low-certainty evidence that physical activity interventions, compared with control reduced BMI (MD -1.53 kg/, 95% CI -2.67 to -0.39; 4 RCTs; n = 720); and low-certainty evidence for a reduction in zBMI (MD -0.2, 95% CI -0.3 to -0.1; 1 RCT; n = 100). There is low-certainty evidence from eight RCTs (n = 16,583) that diet combined with physical activity interventions, compared with control, had no effect on BMI (MD -0.02 kg/, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.05); or zBMI (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.07; 6 RCTs; n = 16,543). Evidence from two RCTs (low-certainty evidence; n = 294) found no effect of diet interventions on BMI.Direct comparisons of interventions: Two RCTs reported data directly comparing diet with either physical activity or diet combined with physical activity interventions for children aged 6 to 12 years and reported no differences.Heterogeneity was apparent in the results from all three age groups, which could not be entirely explained by setting or duration of the interventions. Where reported, interventions did not appear to result in adverse effects (16 RCTs) or increase health inequalities (gender: 30 RCTs; socioeconomic status: 18 RCTs), although relatively few studies examined these factors.Re-running the searches in January 2018 identified 315 records with potential relevance to this review, which will be synthesised in the next update.Interventions that include diet combined with physical activity interventions can reduce the risk of  (zBMI and BMI) in young children aged 0 to 5 years. There is weaker evidence from a single study that dietary interventions may be beneficial.However, interventions that focus only on physical activity do not appear to be effective in children of this age. In contrast, interventions that only focus on physical activity can reduce the risk of  (BMI) in children aged 6 to 12 years, and adolescents aged 13 to 18 years. In these age groups, there is no evidence that interventions that only focus on diet are effective, and some evidence that diet combined with physical activity interventions may be effective. Importantly, this updated review also suggests that interventions to prevent childhood  do not appear to result in adverse effects or health inequalities.The review will not be updated in its current form. To manage the growth in RCTs of child  prevention interventions, in future, this review will be split into three separate reviews based on child age.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579465>The association of food quality score and cardiovascular diseases risk factors among women: A cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p> Limited studies are available regarding the relationship between Food Quality Score (FQS) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Thus, this study was aimed to investigate the association of FQS with CVD risk factors in women.  This cross-sectional study was carried out among 368 women aged 20-50 years who randomly selected from health centers across Tehran, Iran. Dietary intake was collected using a reliable and validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The FQS includes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, yogurt, nuts and legumes, coffee, refined grains, desserts and ice cream, sugar-sweetened beverages, red meats, fried food consumed outside the home, processed meats, potato and potato chips. Standard methods were used to assess blood pressure, biochemical and anthropometric measures. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the association between FQS and CVD risk factors.

Adipocyte fatty acid composition is influenced by dietary availability and may regulate adipokine secretion and adipose inflammation. After feeding F344 rats for 20 weeks with a Western diet or a fish oil-supplemented diet, we cultured primary rat adipose tissue in a three-dimensional explant culture and collected the conditioned medium. The rat adipose tissue secretome was assayed using the Proteome Profiler Cytokine XL Array, and adipose tissue macrophage polarization (M1/ ratio) was assessed using the iNOS/ARG1 ratio. We then assessed the adipokine's effects upon stem cell self-renewal using primary human mammospheres from normal breast mammoplasty tissue. Adipose from rats fed the fish oil diet had an ω-3:ω-6 fatty acid ratio of 0.28 compared to 0.04 in Western diet rats. The adipokine profile from the fish oil-fed rats was shifted toward adipokines associated with reduced inflammation compared to the rats fed the Western diet. The M1/ macrophage ratio decreased by 50% in adipose of fish oil-fed rats compared to that from rats fed the Western diet. Conditioned media from rats fed the high ω-6 Western diet increased stem cell self-renewal by 62%±9% (X¯%±SD) above baseline compared to only an 11%±11% increase with the fish oil rat adipose. Modulating the adipokine secretome with dietary interventions therefore may alter stromal-epithelial signaling that plays a role in controlling mammary stem cell self-renewal.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Overall there was no significant weighted and adjusted association between  and SRCD among cancer survivors (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.99 [95% CI 0.56 to 1.73]). Nevertheless, among cancer survivors of working age (18-59 y), this association was significant (AOR 2.19 [95% CI 1.28 to 3.73]) and therefore  is significantly associated with a 119% increase in the odds of SRCD among Brazilian adult cancer survivors of working age.Since both  and depression may lead to worse health and quality of life outcomes in this young and middle-aged population, further investigations are needed in order to establish the causality and directionality of this association.© The Author(s) 2019.

To date, however, no study has examined the relationship between preoperative BMI and outcomes of deformity surgery as measured by spine parameters such as the sagittal vertical axis (SVA), as well as health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures such as the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Scoliosis Research Society-22 patient questionnaire (SRS-22). To this end, the authors sought to clarify the relationship between BMI and postoperative change in SVA as well as HRQoL outcomes.The authors performed a retrospective review of a prospectively managed multicenter adult spinal deformity database collected and maintained by the International Spine Study Group (ISSG) between 2009 and 2014. The primary independent variable considered was preoperative BMI. The primary outcome was the change in SVA at 1 year after deformity surgery. Postoperative ODI and SRS-22 outcome measures were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Generalized linear models were used to model the primary and secondary outcomes at 1 year as a function of BMI at baseline, while adjusting for potential measured confounders.Increasing BMI (compared to BMI < 18) was not associated with change of SVA at 1 year postsurgery. However, BMIs in the obese range of 30 to 34.9 kg/, compared to BMI < 18 at baseline, were associated with poorer outcomes as measured by the SRS-22 score (estimated change -0.47, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.01, p = 0.04). While BMIs > 30 appeared to be associated with poorer outcomes as determined by the ODI, this correlation did not reach statistical significance.Baseline BMI did not affect the achievable SVA at 1 year postsurgery.

Sleep timing, while less studied, is important in adolescents because increasing evening preferences (chronotypes), early school start times, and irregular sleep schedules may cause circadian misalignment.To investigate associations of chronotype and social jet lag with adiposity and cardiometabolic risk in young adolescents.Starting in 1999, Project Viva recruited pregnant women from eastern Massachusetts. Mother-child in-person visits occurred throughout childhood. From January 23, 2012, to October 16, 2016, 804 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years completed 5 days or more of wrist actigraphy, questionnaires, and anthropometric measurements. A cross-sectional analysis using these data was conducted from April 31, 2018, to May 1, 2019.Chronotype, measured via a continuous scale with higher scores indicating greater evening preferences, and social jet lag, measured as the continuous difference in actigraphy sleep midpoint in hours from midnight on weekends vs weekdays, with higher values representing more delayed sleep timing on weekends.Adiposity, measured via anthropometry and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. For a subset of 479 adolescents with blood samples, cardiometabolic risk scores were computed as the mean of 5 sex- and cohort-specific z scores for waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, inversely scaled high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and log-transformed triglycerides and homeostatic model of insulin resistance.Among the 804 adolescents in the study, 418 were girls and 386 were boys, with a mean (SD) age of 13.2 (0.9) years. In multivariable models adjusted for age, puberty, season, and sociodemographics, associations of chronotype and social jet lag with adiposity varied by sex. For girls, greater evening preference was associated with a 0.58-cm (95% CI, 0.12-1.03 cm; P = .04 for interaction) higher waist circumference and 0.16 kg/ (95% CI, 0.01-0.31 kg/; P = .03 for interaction) higher fat mass index as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; each hour of social jet lag was associated with a 1.19-cm (95% CI, 0.04-2.35 cm; P = .21 for interaction) higher waist circumference and 0.45 kg/ (95% CI, 0.09-0.82 kg/; P = .01 for interaction) higher fat mass index as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Associations of social jet lag and evening chronotypes persisted for many measures of adiposity after adjustment for sleep duration and other lifestyle behaviors. By contrast, no associations were observed in boys. There were no associations with the cardiometabolic risk score for either sex, although statistical power was low for this outcome.Evening chronotypes and social jet lag were associated with greater adiposity in adolescent girls but not adolescent boys.

Delayed diagnosis and surgical intervention of IH might lead to increased morbidity of patients and impairments in their quality of life.To evaluate the predictive factors for early diagnosis and surgical repair of IH after LRYGB.This study analyzed 38 patients during the postoperative period of LRYGB who presented clinical manifestations suggestive of IH after an average of 24 months following the bariatric procedure.The sample consisted of 10 men and 28 women, with a mean age of 37.5 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 39.6 kg/ before LRYGB. All patients presented pain, 23 presented abdominal distension, 10 had nausea and 12 were vomiting; three of them had dysphagia, three had diarrhea and one had gastro-esophageal reflux. The patients presented symptoms for an average of 15 days, varying from 3 to 50 days. Seventeen (45.9%) patients were seen once, while the other 20 (54.1%) went to the emergency room twice or more times. Exploratory laparoscopy was performed on all patients, being converted to laparotomy in three cases. Petersen hernia was confirmed in 22 (57.9%). Petersen space was closed in all patients and the IH correction was performed in 20 (52.6%) cases. The herniated loop showed signs of vascular suffering in seven patients, and two (5.3%) had irreversible ischemia, requiring bowel resection.The presence of recurrent abdominal pain is one of the main indicators for the diagnosis of IH after LRYGB. Patients operated at an early stage, even with negative imaging tests for this disease, benefited from rapid and simple procedures without major complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31368422>High calcium intake from fat-free milk, body composition and glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes: a randomised crossover clinical trial.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the effects of high-Ca fat-free milk v. low-Ca control diet on adiposity and on glycaemic control. Fourteen subjects with type 2 diabetes (aged 49·5 (sd 8·6) years, BMI 29·4 (sd 4·5) kg/, low habitual Ca consumption (<600 mg/d)) were included in this randomised, crossover clinical trial. Subjects participated in two 12-week experimental sessions (high-Ca fat-free milk (HC) or low-Ca control (LC)) separated by 8-week washout. Subjects daily consumed in the laboratory a breakfast shake containing 700 mg (HC) or 6·4 mg (LC) of Ca. Energy-restricted diets containing 800 mg of dietary Ca/d were prescribed. Dietary records data indicated the consumption of 1200 mg of Ca/d during HC and of 525 mg of Ca/d during LC. There was a greater reduction in body weight, body fat mass, waist circumference and waist:hip ratio after HC. Serum 25-hydoxyvitamin D and homeostatic model assessment-2 β-cell function (HOMA2-%B) increased, and serum uric acid, parathormone (PTH) and glycated Hb (HbA1c) concentrations reduced after HC. In addition, changes from baseline in terms of serum uric acid, glucose, HbA1c and PTH concentrations were lower, and those of HOMA2-%B, serum Ca and 25-hydoxyvitamin D were higher after the HC than after LC. The consumption of approximately three servings of fat-free milk and 1200 mg of dietary Ca/d enhanced weight loss, improved body composition and promoted glycaemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes and low habitual Ca consumption (<600 mg/d).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31219580>Differences in Trabecular Plate and Rod Structure in Premenopausal Women Across the Weight Spectrum.</a></h2><p>Premenopausal women with anorexia nervosa (AN) and  (OB) have elevated fracture risk.

Trabecular plate and rod structure has not been reported across the weight spectrum.To investigate trabecular plate and rod structure in premenopausal women.Cross-sectional study.Clinical research center.A total of 105 women age 21 to 46 years: (i) women with AN (n = 46), (ii) eumenorrheic lean healthy controls (HCs) (n = 29), and (iii) eumenorrheic women with OB (n = 30).Trabecular microarchitecture by ITS.Mean age (±SD) was similar (28.9 ± 6.3 years) and body mass index differed (16.7 ± 1.8 vs 22.6 ± 1.4 vs 35.1 ± 3.3 kg/; P < 0.0001) across groups. Bone was less plate-like and axially aligned in AN (P ≤ 0.01) and did not differ between OB and HC. After controlling for weight, plate and axial bone volume fraction and plate number density were lower in OB vs HC; some were lower in OB than AN (P < 0.05). The relationship between weight and plate variables was quadratic (R = 0.39 to 0.70; P ≤ 0.0006) (i.e., positive associations were attenuated at high weight). Appendicular lean mass and IGF-1 levels were positively associated with plate variables (R = 0.27 to 0.67; P < 0.05). Amenorrhea was associated with lower radial plate variables than eumenorrhea in AN (P < 0.05).In women with AN, trabecular bone is less plate-like. In women with OB, trabecular plates do not adapt to high weight. This is relevant because trabecular plates are associated with greater estimated bone strength. Higher muscle mass and IGF-1 levels may mitigate some of the adverse effects of low weight or excess adiposity on bone.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31482538>Feasibility of myocardial perfusion imaging studies in morbidly obese patients with a cadmium-zinc-telluride cardiac camera.</a></h2><p>A novel cardiac SPECT camera with cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) based technology has a fixed array of semiconductor detectors paired with pinhole collimators focused on the heart. Image acquisition in obese patients can be challenging because of much smaller detector field of view compared to conventional gamma cameras. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact on high body mass on the feasibility of CZT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). The additional aim was to investigate the mechanism of the banana-shaped/ artifact, as referred to in literature, and to attempt at simulating it on a phantom study.Study group consisted of 43 patients with morbid  (BMI ≥ 40 kg/). All these patients underwent myocardial perfusion imaging on both CZT cardiac camera and general purpose SPECT/CT gamma camera. Control group consisted of all patients who underwent myocardial perfusion imaging on CZT camera throughout one calendar year and whose BMI was lower than 40 kg/. In this group, all repeated studies were re-analyzed for estimating the frequency of heart mispositioning in the camera field of view. The number of studies performed was 1180. A static cardiac phantom was used to simulate a banana-shaped artifact. A series of phantom acquisitions during which the phantom position was altered in the camera field of view was performed.In control group, 3.7% of all cardiac scintigrams required repetition, 18.9% of which were repeated due to wrong heart positioning; median BMI in this group of patients was 36.0. A banana-shaped artifact was observed in one female patient with BMI 36.0. In morbid  group, 32.6% of the studies were non-diagnostic with "truncation effect" on Scan Quality Control (QC). Median BMI in patients with diagnostic scans was 42.0, while in patients with not acceptable quality control test it was 45.0 (p < 0.05). Banana-shaped artifacts were observed in 5 non-diagnostic studies. In a phantom study an artifact of banana shape was obtained when gantry was distant from the phantom and target was on the edge of the camera field of view and was slightly truncated.Problem with heart mispositioning during imaging on the CZT camera affects less than 1% of all performed studies.

Hypovitaminosis D has been observed even in countries with high incidence of sunlight all year round. Several studies demonstrated a high prevalence of deficiency/insufficiency of vitamin D in adolescents. Objective To investigate the association between the nutritional status of vitamin D with anthropometric measures and blood pressure in overweight adolescents. Methods This a descriptive and cross-sectional study with overweight adolescents of both sexes aged 12-19 years. The anthropometric data, biochemical profile, blood pressure and serum vitamin D dosage were analyzed. The chi-squared test for verification of association and Student's t-test to compare medians between variables were used. Results There were high frequencies of hypovitaminosis D (34%) and hypertension (43.3%) in overweight adolescents. We observed an inverse correlation between serum vitamin D levels and BP (r = -0.28, p = 0.005). Patients with desirable serum vitamin D had lower body mass index values (31.3 kg/ vs. 33.9 kg/; p < 0.02), waist circumference (95.2 cm vs. 101.1 cm; p < 0.03), waist-to-height ratio (0.58 vs. 0.61; p < 0.03) and systolic blood pressure (120 mm Hg vs. 127.6 mm Hg; p = 0.007).

Recent studies have shown that induction of brown-like adipocytes, also referred to as beige or brite cells, in white adipose tissue (WAT) results in the release of excess energy through mitochondrial heat production via uncoupling protein 1. This has potential a therapeutic strategy for  and related diseases as well as classical brown adipocytes. In our previous studies, we found that artepillin C (ArtC, 10 mg/kg body weight), a characteristic constituent of Brazilian propolis, significantly induced the development of brown-like adipocytes in inguinal WAT (iWAT) of mice. Furthermore, we recently demonstrated that curcumin (Cur, 4.5 mg/kg) also significantly induced the development of brown-like adipocytes in mice. The combined administration of several food-derived factors can enhance their bioactivity and reduce their required functional doses. In this study, we showed that co-administration of Cur and ArtC at lower doses (Cur, 1.5 mg/kg; ArtC, 5 mg/kg) additively induce brown-like adipocyte development in mouse iWAT. Moreover, this induction is associated with the localized production of norepinephrine following accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages in iWAT. These findings suggest that co-administration of Cur and ArtC is significantly effective to reduce the dose and enhance the formation of brown-like adipocyte via a unique molecular mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461714>Influence of  on Work Ability, Respiratory Symptoms, and Lung Function in Adults with Asthma.</a></h2><p>Asthma is defined by variable respiratory symptoms and lung function, and may influence work ability.

Additionally,  was not significantly associated with the risk of frailty before and after adjusting for WHtR in older men. Mediation analysis revealed that the association between BMI and frailty score was mediated by WHtR. Moreover, the mediating effect of WHtR on frailty score was positive in both women and men, but the frailty score was associated with BMI positively in women and negatively in men.

Targeting macrophage polarization provides a promising therapeutic strategy for -related metabolic disorders and inflammation. Here, we show that SO1989, a derivative of natural occurring compound oleanolic acid, restores the balance between M1-polarized and -polarized macrophages in high fat diets (HFD)-induced obese mice resulting in the improvement of adipose inflammation and the metabolic dysfunctions.Histological analysis, magnetic cell sorting and FACS, in vitro cell model of adipose inflammation, Western blotting, HFD mice model.SO1989 exhibits similar or even stronger activity in inhibiting inflammation and M1 polarization of macrophages both in vitro and in vivo compared to its analogue CDDO-Me, previously known as a powerful anti-inflammation chemical small molecule. In addition, SO1989 can significantly increase the level of fatty acid oxidation in macrophages which can efficiently facilitate  polarization of macrophages. Unlike CDDO-Me, SO1989 shows less adverse effects on obese mice.Taken all together, our findings identify SO1989 as a modulator in macrophage polarization and a safer potential leading compound for pro-resolution of inflammation treatment in metabolic disorders.

The trial will include 48 patients with a body mass index ≥ 35 kg/m, scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery using sleeve or a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass technique, who will be allocated 1:1 to undergo general inhalational anesthesia with sevoflurane or total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol. The primary endpoint is the difference in plasma interleukin (IL)-6 levels when comparing the two anesthetic agents. Blood samples will be collected prior to anesthesia induction (baseline), immediately after anesthetic induction, and before endotracheal extubation. Levels of other proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil chemotaxis, macrophage differentiation, phagocytosis, and occurrence of intraoperative and postoperative complications will also be evaluated.To our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial designed to compare the effects of two different anesthetics on immunomodulation in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Our hypothesis is that anesthesia with sevoflurane will result in a weaker proinflammatory response compared to anesthesia with propofol, with lower circulating levels of IL-6 and other proinflammatory mediators, and increased macrophage differentiation into the  phenotype in adipose tissue.Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clínicos, RBR-77kfj5 .

Data were collected from consented participants recruited using multistage sampling technique. Data were entered, checked for quality and analyzed by SPSS for Windows version 20.0. Since the outcome variables were ordered categorical, we used multinomial logistic regression model to identify associated factors. Among the independent variables included in the model no multicolinearity was observed. The level of significance was set at P value ≤ 0.05.The observed prevalence of hypertension (21.8%) was remarkable in rural setting. Out of hypertensive participants, 195 (45.9%) were newly diagnosed. About one third of the participants (31.4%) had central  measured by waist-to-height ratio ≥0.50.

Comparing 5th to the 1st quintile, HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were 1.12 (1.02-1.22) and 1.59 (1.39-1.83) for BMI, 1.16 (1.07-1.27) and 1.66 (1.44-1.90) for WC, 1.28 (1.17-1.40) and 1.88 (1.63-2.18) for WHtR, 1.44 (1.32-1.58) and 2.04 (1.76-2.36) for WHR, and 1.84 (1.62-2.09) and 2.72 (2.23-3.32) for hip-adjusted WC, respectively. Hip-adjusted WC had the strongest associations with the intermediate outcomes.Indicators of visceral adiposity (e.g., hip-adjusted WC) were much stronger predictors of overall and cardiovascular mortality than were indicators of general adiposity (e.g., BMI). The full-strength effect of visceral adiposity becomes apparent only when both WC, as a risk factor, and hip circumference, as a protective factor, are individually and simultaneously taken into consideration.© 2019 The Author(s).

This research aimed to evaluate midlife body mass index (BMI) trajectory and assess its relationship with frailty 8 years later in Taiwan.A prospective cohort study.Data were retrieved from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging conducted from 1999 to 2007. The analysis was restricted to respondents aged between 50 to 69 years old, who were not frail in 1999 and were alive in 2007 (n=1609).Frailty was defined using the Fried criteria. The group-based model of trajectory was used to estimate BMI trajectories among elderly participants. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between BMI change and frailty.Four trajectory classes were identified and each remained stable during the 8-year follow-up. There were 316 participants (20.3%) in the low-normal weight group (baseline BMI=20.38 kg/), 737 participants (44.7%) in the high-normal weight group (baseline BMI=23.22 kg/), 449 participants (28.4%) in the overweight group (baseline BMI=26.24 kg/), and 107 participants (6.6%) in the  group (baseline BMI=30.65 kg/). After adjustment for confounding factors, the low-normal weight group and  group were associated with increased frailty compared with the high-normal weight group.Our results showed that the BMI trajectories of midlife individuals tended to be constant and those in both the low-normal weight group and  group had an increased risk of developing frailty in later life. Therefore, an optimal weight-targeting strategy should be considered for Asian elderly individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31363171>IL-29 promoted -induced inflammation and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Adipocyte-macrophage crosstalk plays a critical role to regulate adipose tissue microenvironment and cause chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of . Interleukin-29 (IL-29), a member of type 3 interferon family, plays a role in host defenses against microbes, however, little is known about its role in metabolic disorders. We explored the function of IL-29 in the pathogenesis of -induced inflammation and insulin resistance. We found that serum IL-29 level was significantly higher in obese patients. IL-29 upregulated IL-1β, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression and decreased glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity in human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes through reducing glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and AKT signals. In addition, IL-29 promoted monocyte/macrophage migration. Inhibition of IL-29 could reduce inflammatory cytokine production in macrophage-adipocyte coculture system, which mimic an obese microenvironment. In vivo, IL-29 reduced insulin sensitivity and increased the number of peritoneal macrophages in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. IL-29 increased M1/ macrophage ratio and enhanced MCP-1 expression in adipose tissues of HFD mice. Therefore, we have identified a critical role of IL-29 in -induced inflammation and insulin resistance, and we conclude that IL-29 may be a novel candidate target for treating  and insulin resistance in patients with metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31499286>Complications of Pregnancy in Morbidly Obese Patients: What is the Impact of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus?</a></h2><p>The synergistic role of severe  and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on pregnancy complications has been poorly studied. We aim to analyze the impact of GDM on pregnancy complications in women with class III .we performed a retrospective monocentric study including women with a pregestational BMI ≥ 40 kg/ with a singleton pregnancy from January 1996 to December 2014. We compared the risks of maternal, fetal and neonatal complications between patients with GDM and those without GDM.We included 354 patients, 121 (34.3%) had GDM and 63 needed insulin treatment (52.9% of the GDM women). Patients with GDM were older (30.4 ± 5.1 vs 28.9 ± 4.8 years,p = 0.008) and had more frequently a history of GDM (24.8% vs 6.1%; p < 0.0001). Patients with GDM were more often hospitalized (47.8% vs 29.8%, p = 0.001) and were more likely to have premature birth (11.7% vs. 5.3%, p = 0.031). Neonates from mothers with GDM were more frequently large for gestational age (31.6% vs 19.4%, p = 0.011), and had a higher rate of transfers to neonatal intensive unit (9.2% vs 4.0%, p=0.047). There was no difference for preeclampsia, C-section, shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycemia or postpartum complications. Outcomes were comparable in women with or without insulin therapy.The rate of GDM is particularly high in class III obese women. Morbidly obese women with GDM were more at risk for complications and needed more often insulin therapy. Our results suggest to pay a particular attention in this high-risk population.Copyright © 2019.

Demographics, body mass index (BMI), medical history, and laboratory parameters were compared for groups stratified by  (≥ 28 kg/) or CKD. An association between  and CKD was analyzed, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted for risk factors associated with CKD.In the overall population, 28.7% were obese and 54.8% had CKD; there were more women (58.8%) than men. The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes was similar between the obese and nonobese groups and between the CKD and non-CKD groups. Obese patients had significantly higher levels of serum uric acid and estimated glomerular filtration rates when compared with the nonobese group. When compared with those without CKD, patients with CKD were significantly older in addition to having higher BMI and serum uric acid levels. The multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that CKD was positively associated with age, BMI, and serum uric acid levels.Elderly obese patients with NAFLD are at a higher risk of CKD. NAFLD patients with advanced age, greater BMI, or higher serum uric acid levels are more prone to developing CKD. The renal function of NAFLD patients should be closely monitored.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31247010>Body composition from 18 to 22 years and pulmonary function at 22 years-1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort.</a></h2><p>The objective was to verify the association between body composition from 18 to 22 years and pulmonary function at 22 years of age. This longitudinal analysis was conducted with a Brazilian birth cohort data. The outcomes were the forced expiratory volume in the first second and forced vital capacity (FVC), measured at 22 years follow-up. Main exposures:  (body mass index ≥ 30kg/), and highest tertiles of fat mass (FM) and fat mass index (air displacement plethysmography) measured at 18 and 22 years-old follow-ups. The reference category (not exposed) was defined by those individuals who were not classified in the highest adiposity categories mentioned, in both ages. Multivariable linear regressions stratified by sex were used. The sample comprised 3,511 participants. Those who belonged to the highest adiposity categories in 18 and 22 years follow-ups showed lower pulmonary function at 22 years when compared to those who were not classified in the higher adiposity categories in both ages (reference category); those in the highest tertile of FM showed a mean FVC -313mL (95%CI -421; -206) and -259mL (95%CI -336; -182) in men and women, compared to the reference category, respectively. Those who changed from the higher to the lower adiposity categories (from 18 to 22 years) showed pulmonary function similar to the reference, and those who presented the opposite body composition trajectory, showed decreased pulmonary function results at 22 years, mainly among women. We concluded that high body adiposity in two follow-ups and especially contemporary adiposity was associated with lower pulmonary function at 22 years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31507109>[ASSOCIATION OF , SMOKING AND SOCIOECONOMIC STRATA WITH THE FIBROMYALGIA SYNDROME].</a></h2><p>This study aimed to examine a possible association between BMI levels, smoking and socio-economic status and the existence of fibromyalgia. is a worldwide epidemic with devastating impacts on the public's health. There are several indications that  might also be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia.Patients who were diagnosed with fibromyalgia were compared to population-based controls, matched in age and gender (by a ratio of 1:5). Body mass indices, smoking status and socioeconomic strata were retrieved from computerized medical records of the Clalit Health Services database. Body mass index was classified in WHO categories of underweight, normal, overweight and obese (<18.5, 18.5-<25, 25.0-<30, ≥30.0 kg/); χ2, t-tests, and logistic regression models were used to compare the study groups and assess the association between  and fibromyalgia.The study included 14,296 patients with fibromyalgia and 71,324 controls. Among patients with fibromyalgia the average BMI (body mass index) was higher than that of the controls 29.1± 6.2 vs. 28.0± 6.01, p<0.001) with every increment of 1 unit of the BMI score, there was an increment of 2.7% of the odds of having coexistent fibromyalgia. The chances of having fibromyalgia was 56% higher among subjects with  compared to individuals of normal weight.

Precision medicine, already recognised as a right approach for COPD, requests a special attention to be allocated for nutritional status. Free fat mass index FFMI and visceral fat VFA area measurements should be added to body mass index (BMI) in order to have a complete perspective of the nutritional status and disease prognosis. Prospective medical nutrition therapy should consider caloric intake for achieving a BMI of 20-24 kg/, nutritionally dense, small and frequent meals, choosing the moment for the most important meal when the level of energy is the highest for the patient. A resting period before mealtime is adviced.  paradox in COPD means a lower mortality associated with BMI between 25 and 32. This benefit is mainly related to higher muscular mass, as it has been described by some authors. The main objective in nutritional intervention will be to maintain muscular mass, adviced protein intake should be 1.2 g/kg body weight/day, higher vs general population. In the future, nutritional status evaluation should be included in pulmonary rehabilitation process, and a multidisciplinary team is expected to cooperate in order to achieve best pulmonary results.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522170>Lifestyle Interventions for Weight Management in People with Serious Mental Illness: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis, Trial Sequential Analysis, and Meta-Regression Analysis Exploring the Mediators and Moderators of Treatment Effects.</a></h2><p>Serious mental illness (SMI) reduces life expectancy, primarily due to somatic comorbidity linked to . Meta-analyses have found beneficial effects of lifestyle interventions in people with SMI and recommended their implementation to manage .The objective of this systematic review was to assess the benefits and harms of individualized lifestyle interventions for weight in people diagnosed with SMI and to explore potential mediators and moderators of the effect.The protocol was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42016049093). Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of individualized lifestyle interventions on weight management in people with SMI were included. Primary outcomes were differences in endpoint body mass index (BMI) and the proportion achieving clinically relevant weight loss (≥5%). Secondary outcomes included quality of life, cardiometabolic risk factors, and adverse effects.We included 41 RCTs (n = 4,267). All trials were at high risk of bias according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The experimental interventions reduced the mean difference in BMI by -0.63 kg/ (95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.02 to -0.23; p = 0.002; I2 = 70.7%) compared to the control groups. At postintervention follow-up (17 RCTs), the effect size remained similar but was no longer significant (BMI = -0.63 kg/; 95% CI = -1.30 to 0.04; p = 0.07; I2 = 48.8%). The risk ratio for losing ≥5% of baseline weight was 1.51 (95% CI = 1.07-2.13; p = 0.02) compared to the control groups. GRADE showed very low or low quality of evidence.There is a statistically significant, but clinically insignificant, mean effect of individualized lifestyle interventions for weight reduction in people with SMI.© 2019 S.

Predictors and severity of hypoglycaemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy, and gastric banding were investigated in a large prospective study.This study was performed at an excellence centre for BS at a tertiary care institution. Data of 333 patients (mean BMI: 44.9 ± 9.6 kg/; mean age: 40 ± 10 years; 80.7% women) were analysed in a prospective study with a 2-year observation period after BS. All patients underwent a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with measurements of blood glucose (BG) and insulin. For the purpose of this study, hypoglycaemia was defined as a post-challenge BG <2.8 mmol/L during the OGTT.72 (25.6%) of 281 patients showed post-challenge hypoglycaemia after surgery. Hypoglycaemia was different after various procedures: 32.6% of patients after RYGB, 22.6% after sleeve gastrectomy, but only 2.3% after gastric banding had hypoglycaemia. In the whole group, patients with hypoglycaemia had lost more weight (p = 0.013), had a slightly greater decrease in BMI (p = 0.037), a greater change in 2-hour post-challenge BG (p = 0.001), and a smaller change in 1-hour post-challenge insulin (p = 0.004) compared to patients without hypoglycaemia.This prospective study shows a higher prevalence of severe hypoglycaemia (25.6%) after BS than anticipated from retrospective registers. A systematic evaluation of glucose and insulin levels by OGTT 2 years post-surgery may help to identify patients at increased risk for symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) remains the most common bariatric surgery procedure performed, representing more than 50% of all primary bariatric interventions. Major surgical complications of SG include staple-line bleeding, leaking, and stenosis. A leak along the staple-line most commonly occurs at the gastroesophageal junction (GOJ). From January 2018 to December 2018, our centre performed 226 bariatric procedures, of which, 97.8% were primary bariatric procedures. The mean age and BMI were 38.7±8.3 years and 44 kg/, respectively. Out of the 202 primary SG performed, we encountered two cases of a staple-line leak (0.99%). This is the first reported case series of SG leaks from the Southeast Asia region. A summary of their characteristics, clinical presentation, subsequent management, and the outcome is discussed. Based on the latest available evidence from the literature, several methods may decrease staple-line leaks in SG. These include the use of a bougie size greater than 40 Fr, routine use of methylene blue test during surgery, beginning transection at 2-6 cm from the pylorus, mobilising the fundus before transection, and staying away from the GOJ at the last firing. Other methods include the proper alignment of the staple-line, control of staple-line bleeding, and performing staple-line reinforcement. The management of a staple-line leak remains challenging due to limited systematic, evidence-based literature being available.

Recent data indicated that a specific diet may affect the course and appearance of acne. The aim of the study was to analyze the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and acne prevalence and severity. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 143 consecutively recruited adolescents aged between 12 and 18. All participants were physically examined, including measurement of weight and height and type and severity of acne. Acne lesions were evaluated as not present (0), mild (1), moderate (2), and severe (3). The predominant type of acne lesions was used to classify the acne into one of the following subtypes: comedonic acne, papulo-pustular acne, and nodulo-cystic acne. Acne was present in 123 adolescents (86.0%) being more prevalent in teenagers ≥15 years old than in those between 12 and 14 years old (97.1% vs. 76.0%, respectively, P<0.001). The prevalence of acne did not differ significantly between teenagers with different BMI. However, those teenagers who were overweight or obese suffer from the inflammatory type of acne (papulo-pustular or nodulo-cystic) more often compared with underweight, slim, or normal-weight teenagers (P=0.03). The mean BMI value in patients with comedonic acne was significantly lower (mean BMI ± Standard Deviation (SD): 20.0±3.5 kg/) when compared with papulo-pustular acne (22.2±3.8 kg/, P=0.04) or nodulo-cystic acne (23.9±5.1 kg/, P<0.01). The BMI value correlated significantly with the severity of acne (ρ=0.33, P<0.001) and with higher number of skin areas involved with acne (ρ=0.23, P<0.01). Our findings clearly indicate the association between overweight/ and acne. Such a relationship has a significant impact on the treatment of patients with acne, as therapy should focus not only on proper selection of medications but also take into account modification of the patient's dietary habits, physical activity, and, if necessary, reduction of body weight.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536528>Trends in maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and its association with birth and maternal outcomes in California, 2007-2016: A retrospective cohort study.</a></h2><p>To determine recent trends in maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and to quantify its association with birth and maternal outcomes.A population-based retrospective cohort study included resident women with singleton births in the California Birth Statistical Master Files (BSMF) database from 2007 to 2016.

In the current study, we tested whether consumption of luteolin, an anti-inflammatory flavonoid, could mitigate adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance in obese ovariectomized mice. Nine-week-old ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice were fed a low-fat diet, high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD supplemented with 0.005% luteolin (HFD+L) for 16 weeks. Results showed no difference in body weight or fat mass between mice fed HFD+L and those fed HFD. However, luteolin supplementation resulted in lower CD11c macrophages in gonadal adipose tissue, as well as a trend toward lower macrophage infiltration. Luteolin supplementation also significantly lowered mRNA expression of inflammatory and M1 markers MCP-1, CD11c, TNF-α and IL-6, while maintaining expression of  marker MGL1. Consistent with this, the in vitro luteolin treatment, with or without the presence of estrogen, inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced polarization of RAW 264.7 cells toward M1 phenotype. We further found that luteolin supplementation protected mice from insulin resistance induced by HFD consumption; this improved insulin resistance was correlated with reductions in CD11c adipose tissue macrophages. Taken together, these findings indicate that dietary luteolin supplementation attenuates adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance found in mice with loss of ovarian function coupled with an HFD intake, and this effect may be partly mediated through suppressing M1-like polarization of macrophages in adipose tissue.

WAT browning confers beneficial effects on adiposity, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. In this study, it was found out that circNrxn2 sponged miR-103 and enhanced FGF10 levels in HFD mice WAT. We discovered that circNrxn2 promoted WAT browning and mitochondria functions. Furthermore, circNrxn2 also increased  macrophage polarization in HFD mouse adipose tissue, and the PPARγ signaling pathway participated in these biological processes. Moreover, eliminating adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) by clodronate-crippled circNrxn2 promoted WAT browning, and the simulation co-culture of macrophages and adipocytes results suggested that circNrxn2 promoted WAT browning through increasing  macrophage polarization. Our finding revealed that circNrxn2 acted as an endogenous miR-103 sponge, blocked miR-103 effects, and relieved its inhibition of FGF10 expression to promote WAT browning through increasing  macrophage polarization.

There is a lot of evidence that some polyphenols, such as green tea, have a positive impact on the OS state and consecutively, on inflammation.the purposes of this study were: a) evaluate OS biomarkers in both obese and normal weight women; and b) evaluate if green tea supplementation has an impact on OS and inflammatory cytokine biomarkers of obese women.we evaluated obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 40 kg/m²) and normal weight (BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m²) women. Blood samples were used to access malondialdehyde (MDA), trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and inflammatory cytokines. We randomly chose obese patients (18 individuals) and then gave them green tea supplementation for eight weeks.

The serum levels of MDA were higher in obese (2.52 ± 0.31 µmol/l) than in eutrophic women (2.13 ± 0.26 µmol/l; p = 0.000). On the other hand, lower TEAC values were observed in the obese (0.75 ± 0.06 mM/l) than in the eutrophic group (0.78 ± 0.04 mM/l; p = 0.009). After the green tea intervention, MDA decreased 4.7% and TEAC increased 10%. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) serum levels decreased 12.7% after treatment (p = 0.03).a) the obese group had lower antioxidant capacity than eutrophic; and b) green tea supplementation ameliorated TEAC and MDA and reduced serum levels of IL-6 in obese women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483797>Posturographic characteristics of the standing posture and the effects of the treatment of  on obese young women.</a></h2><p>To determine the impact of body weight on quiet standing postural sway characteristics in young women, this research compared spontaneous oscillations of the center of foot pressure (COP) between 32 obese (BMI: 36.4 ± 5.2 kg/), and 26 normal-weight (BMI: 21.4 ± 1.5 kg/) women and assessed the influence of  treatment and body weight reduction on postural sway. Trajectories of the COP were assessed while the subjects were standing quietly with eyes open (EO) and closed (EC). Both in the sagittal (AP) and frontal (ML) planes the sway range, average velocity, and maximal velocity of COP were calculated. Moreover, the total average and maximal velocities were computed. In the obese group, the tests were performed twice-before and after the  treatment. A greater (18% in EC) AP sway range and a substantial reduction of ML sway (25% in EO, 22% in EC) were observed in the obese women. The total COP velocities (average and maximal) were decreased in obese women (20% and 20% in EO) as well as the velocities in the frontal plane (EO: 33%, 41%; EC: 34%, 40%). Body weight reduction resulted in significant changes in postural sway. The following parameters increased: ML sway range (28% in EO), average (20% in EO, 16% in EC) and maximal ML (20% in EO) velocities. The results indicate that young obese women in the habitual standing position are characterized by the destabilizing influence of mass in the sagittal plane only in the absence of a visual control. This effect is dominated by the stabilizing mass effect in the frontal plane, which affects overall postural stability when standing. The reduction of body mass enables a decrease in ML static stability, likely due to natural changes in the base of support while standing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31383241>Information on Bedtimes and Wake Times Improves the Relation Between Self-Reported and Objective Assessments of Sleep in Adults.</a></h2><p>To investigate the correlation between self-reported and objective measures of total sleep time (TST) in adults and examine whether sex, race/ethnicity, and weight status influence this association.Participants were individuals who screened for sleep intervention studies, providing > 7 days of wrist actigraphy sleep data (TSTobj) and reporting sleep duration (TSTPSQI) using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire (n = 53 men, 60 women; 59% minority/Hispanics; age 30.9 ± 9.7 years; body mass index 26.2 ± 3.2 kg/). In addition, TSTbed/wake was calculated as the difference between bedtime and waketime, minus the time to fall asleep, from the PSQI. Univariate regression analyses were performed to assess the relation between TSTobj and TSTPSQI and TSTbed/wake and compare the relation by sex, race, and ethnicity. Bland-Altman tests were done to assess bias by sex, race/ethnicity, weight status, and sleep quality.TSTbed/wake correlated with TSTobj ( = .57,  < .0001). TSTPSQI and TSTbed/wake were greater than TSTobj (0.63 ± 0.99 hours and 0.79 ± 0.76 hours, respectively, both  < .0001). The difference between TSTPSQI and TSTobj did not vary by sex (β = .12,  = .52), race/ethnicity (β = .15,  = .48), age (β = -.01,  = .27), or body mass index (β = .04,  = .13) whereas that between TSTbed/wake and TSTobj varied by age (β = -.020,  = .0051), BMI (β = .054,  = .0021), race/ethnicity (β = .36,  = .021), and sleep efficiency (β = -.089,  < .0001).Calculating TST using self-reported bedtimes and wake times provided TST estimate that correlated with TSTobj but greater over-reporting occurred in younger and heavier individuals, non-whites or Hispanics, and those with low sleep efficiency. In clinical and research settings, asking individuals to report bedtimes, wake times, and length of time to fall asleep may more accurately estimate TST than asking about sleep duration alone.Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

Participants took phen/top (7.5/46-15/92 mg/d) for at least 3 months preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively. We compared weight loss, BMI changes, and odds for achieving BMI <40 for phen/top + LSG to historical controls. Controls had an initial BMI ≥50 and underwent LSG, without phen/top, at our center during the same timeframe (n = 40).Of the 25 participants recruited, 13 completed LSG. Phen/top participants had a baseline BMI of 61.2 ± 7.1 kg/m compared with 57.0 ± 5.6 kg/m for control participants. Percent initial weight loss was -39.3% (phen/top + LSG) versus -31.4% (control) at 12 months, P = .018; by 24 months, phen/top + LSG had an 11.2% greater initial weight loss, P = .007. At 24 months, the mean BMI was 33.8 kg/m for phen/top versus 42 kg/m for controls. The odds ratio for achieving a BMI <40 at 2 years with phen/top + LSG versus LSG alone was 4.1 (95% confidence interval, 0.8-21).Compared with LSG alone, phen/top combined with LSG may help patients with a BMI >50 achieve greater weight loss and reach a BMI <40.

In addition, ERS enhances macrophage activation. So far, the function of Hoxa5 in -induced chronic inflammation has been poorly understood. Herein, we demonstrate the importance of the transcription factor, Hoxa5, in determining adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) polarity and ERS. Hoxa5 decreased bodyweight, reduced inflammatory cytokine secretion and corresponded with an increased number of  macrophages in the adipose tissue of high-fat diet (HFD) mice. Transcriptome sequencing data showed that overexpression of Hoxa5 in adipocytes changed expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein processing-related genes. Based on transcriptome sequencing data and bioinformatics prediction, we have been suggested that Hoxa5 alleviated inflammatory responses by inhibiting ERS and by activating PPARγ pathway in mouse adipose tissue. Hoxa5 alleviated ERS and inflammatory responses by inhibiting the eIF2α/PERK signalling pathway in adipocytes. Hoxa5 also inhibited chronic inflammation of adipocytes by promoting  macrophage polarization. In addition, Hoxa5 transcriptionally activated the PPARγ pathway to promote polarization of  macrophages, which in turn alleviated chronic inflammation of adipocytes. Taken together, these results shed light on the mechanisms underlying Hoxa5-dependent inhibition of -induced chronic inflammation by reducing ERS and promoting polarization of  macrophages. These results suggest that Hoxa5 may be a potential therapeutic target for  and other metabolic syndromes.© 2019 The Authors.

During a clinic visit, the sleep habits of participants were recorded via a sleep history questionnaire, and BMI and WC measurements were also recorded. Multivariate analysis was used to examine the associations among sleep duration, sleep quality, general  (measured by BMI), and abdominal  (measured by WC).The authors studied participants who provided data for the variables of interest (N=3778; 1363 men and 2415 women). Of all participants, 3317 (87.8%) were overweight, and 2149 (56.9%) were obese. The mean (SD) BMI was 32.1 (7.2) kg/, and the mean (SD) WC was 103.3 (16.0) cm. Mean sleep duration was 6.3 (1.4) hours for men and 6.4 (1.5) hours for women. Among the men, a significant negative relationship was found between sleep duration and body composition: longer sleep was associated with lower BMI levels but negatively associated with WC in men (β=-1.06; P<.01)].

Outcome assessment occurred at weeks 0 and 24. Energy intake, activity, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) were measured with doubly labeled water (DLW; with and without adjustments for change in RMR), armband accelerometers, and indirect calorimetry, respectively. Appetite and compensatory health beliefs were measured by self-report.A per-protocol analysis included 171 participants (72.5% women; mean ± SD baseline body mass index: 31.5 ± 4.7 kg/). Significant (P < 0.01) compensation occurred in the 8 KKW (mean: 1.5 kg; 95% CI: 0.9, 2.2 kg) and 20 KKW (mean: 2.7 kg; 95% CI: 2.0, 3.5 kg) groups, and compensation differed significantly between the exercise groups (P = 0.01). Energy intake by adjusted DLW increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the 8 KKW (mean: 90.7 kcal/d; 95% CI: 35.1, 146.4 kcal/d) and 20 KKW (mean: 123.6 kcal/d; 95% CI: 64.5, 182.7 kcal/d) groups compared with control (mean: -2.3 kcal/d; 95% CI: -58.0, 53.5 kcal/d). Results were similar without DLW adjustment. RMR and physical activity (excluding structured exercise) did not differentially change among the 3 groups. Participants with higher compared with lower compensation reported increased appetite ratings and beliefs that healthy behaviors can compensate for unhealthy behaviors. Furthermore, they increased craving for sweet foods, increased sleep disturbance, and had worsening bodily pain.Compensation resulted from increased energy intake and concomitant increases in appetite, which can be treated with dietary or pharmacological interventions.

Weight, body composition, serum non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), M1- and -macrophage markers by qPCR and immunohistochemistry in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle were measured following a 12-h overnight fast (fed day, all groups) and a 24-h fast (IF groups only).IF70 resulted in greater weight and fat losses and reductions in serum NEFA versus DR70 and IF100 (P < 0.05) after fed days. Markers of inflammation in serum (TNFα, IL6 and IL10), subcutaneous adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (CD68, CD40 and CD163) were unchanged by DR or IF after fed days. After fasting, NEFA, M1-macrophages (CD40) in adipose tissue, and -macrophages (CD163) in muscle were increased in IF70 and IF100 (all P < 0.05) and the changes in NEFA and mRNA of pan-macrophage marker CD68 in adipose tissue were positively correlated (r = 0.56, P = 0.002).Unlike caloric restriction, IF transiently elevated markers of macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, possibly in response to marked increases in adipose tissue lipolysis.Crown Copyright © 2019.

Secondary objectives were to determine the impact of KE on nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration and glucoregulatory hormones.We conducted a randomized controlled crossover experiment in 15 individuals with  (mean ± SD age: 47 ± 10 y; BMI: 34 ± 5 kg/). After an overnight fast, participants consumed a KE drink [(R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate; 0.45 mL/kg body weight] or taste-matched control drink 30 min before completing a 75-g OGTT. Participants and study personnel performing laboratory analyses were blinded to each condition.The KE increased d-β-hydroxybutyrate to a maximum of ∼3.4 mM (P < 0.001) during the OGTT. Compared with the control drink, KE reduced glucose (-11%, P = 0.002), NEFA (-21%, P = 0.009), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (-31%, P = 0.001) areas under the curve (AUCs), whereas glucagon AUC increased (+11%, P = 0.030). No differences in triglyceride, C-peptide, and insulin AUCs were observed after the KE drink. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased and heart rate increased after the KE drink (both P < 0.01).A KE drink consumed before an OGTT lowered glucose and NEFA AUCs with no increase in circulating insulin.

In this study, metabolite profiles of AZD1979 in human hepatocytes revealed a series of glutathione-related metabolites, including the glutathionyl, cysteinyl, cysteinylglycinyl, and mercapturic acid conjugates. The formation of these metabolites was not inhibited by coincubation with the cytochrome P450 (P450) inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole. In efforts to identify the mechanistic features of this pathway, investigations were performed to characterize the structure of the glutathionyl conjugate M12 of AZD1979 and to identify the enzyme system catalyzing its formation. Studies with various human liver subcellular fractions established that the formation of M12 was NAD(P)H-independent and proceeded in cytosol and S9 fractions but not in microsomal or mitochondrial fractions. The formation of M12 was inhibited by ethacrynic acid, an inhibitor of glutathione -transferases (GSTs). Several human recombinant GSTs, including GSTA1, A2-2, M1a, -2, T1-1, and GST from human placenta, were incubated with AZD1979. All GSTs tested catalyzed the formation of M12, with GSTA2-2 being the most efficient. Metabolite M12 was purified from rat liver S9 incubations and its structure elucidated by NMR. These results establish that M12 is the product of the GST-catalyzed glutathione attack on the carbon atom  to the nitrogen atom of the strained spiro-azetidinyl moiety to give, after ring opening, the corresponding amino-thioether conjugate product, a direct conjugation pathway that occurs without the prior substrate bioactivation by P450. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The investigated compound, AZD1979, contains a 6-substituted-2-oxa-6-azaspiro[3.3]heptanyl derivative that is an example of strained heterocycles, including spiro-fused ring systems, that are widely used in synthetic organic chemistry. An unusual azetidinyl ring-opening reaction involving a nucleophilic attack by glutathione, which does not involve prior cytochrome P450-catalyzed bioactivation of the substrate and which is catalyzed by glutathione transferases, is reported. We propose a mechanism involving the protonated cyclic aminyl intermediate that undergoes nucleophilic attack by glutathione thiolate anion in this reaction, catalyzed by glutathione transferases.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31322697>The effect of sex and body weight on lung volumes during sleep.</a></h2><p>Low lung volumes are thought to contribute to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

All of these conditions may be associated with low lung volumes. The aim was to measure FRC during wake, NREM, and REM in NW and overweight (OW) men and women while in the supine and lateral body positions.Eighty-one healthy adults were instrumented for polysomnography, but with nasal pressure replaced with a sealed, non-vented mask connected to an N2 washout system. During wakefulness and sleep, repeated measurements of FRC were made in both supine and right lateral positions.Two hundred eighty-five FRC measures were obtained during sleep in 29 NW (body mass index [BMI] = 22 ± 0.3 kg/) and 29 OW (BMI = 29 ± 0.7 kg/) individuals. During wakefulness, FRC differed between BMI groups and positions (supine: OW = 58 ± 3 and NW = 68 ± 3% predicted; lateral OW = 71 ± 3, NW = 81 ± 3% predicted). FRC fell from wake to NREM sleep in all participants and in both positions by a similar amount. As a result, during NREM sleep FRC was lower in OW than NW individuals (supine 46 ± 3 and 56 ± 3% predicted, respectively). FRC during REM was similar to NREM and no sex differences were observed in any position or sleep stage.Reductions in FRC while supine and with increased body weight may contribute to worsened OSA in these conditions, but low lung volumes appear unlikely to explain the worsening of OSA in REM and in men versus women.© Sleep Research Society 2019.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common comorbidity in patients with MO. The aim is to study T2DM remission and to develop a prediction model for T2DM remission after two-stage surgical treatment of patients with MO.Materials and methods: The study included 97 patients with MO. The mean BMI was 68.08 (95% CI: 66.45 - 69.71) kg/. 70 (72,2%) patients with MO were diagnosed with T2DM. The first stage of treatment for the main group (n=60) included the IGB placement, for the control group (n=37) - conservative therapy. In the second stage of treatment the patients underwent bariatric surgery. The study addresses such indicators as BMI, percentage of weight loss, percentage of excess weight loss, ASA physical status class, fasting glucose level, HbA1c, C-peptide.Results: Two-stage treatment of morbidly obese patients with T2DM promotes complete T2DM remission in 68.1% of patients. The risk prediction model for failure to achieve complete T2DM remission 12 months after LRYGB based on a baseline C-peptide level has a high predictive value, AUC = 0.84 (95% CI: 0.69-0.93), OR = 0.23 ( 95% CI: 0.08-0.67).Conclusions: Two-stage treatment of patients with MO promotes improvement of carbohydrate metabolism indicators. With a C-peptide level > 3.7 ng/ml, prediction of complete T2DM remission 12 months after Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass is favorable.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304532>Association between pre-ablation bariatric surgery and atrial fibrillation recurrence in morbidly obese patients undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation.</a></h2><p> decreases arrhythmia-free survival after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation by mechanisms that are not fully understood. We investigated the impact of pre-ablation bariatric surgery (BS) on AF recurrence after ablation.In this retrospective observational cohort study, 239 consecutive morbidly obese patients (body mass index ≥40 kg/ or ≥35 kg/ with -related complications) were followed for a mean of 22 months prior to ablation. Of these patients, 51 had BS prior to ablation, and our primary outcome was whether BS was associated with a lower rate of AF recurrence during follow-up. Adjustment for confounding was performed with multivariable Cox proportional hazard models and propensity-score based analyses. During a mean follow-up of 36 months after ablation, 10/51 patients (20%) in the BS group had recurrent AF compared with 114/188 (61%) in the non-BS group (P < 0.0001). In the BS group, 6 patients (12%) underwent repeat ablation compared with 77 patients (41%) in the non-BS group, (P < 0.0001). On multivariable analysis, the association between BS and lower AF recurrence remained significant. Similarly, after weighting and adjusting for the inverse probability of the propensity score, BS was still associated with a lower hazard of AF recurrence (hazard ratio 0.14, 95% confidence interval 0.05-0.39; P = 0.002).Bariatric surgery is associated with a lower AF recurrence after ablation. Morbidly obese patients should be considered for BS prior to AF ablation, though prospective multicentre studies should be performed to confirm our novel finding.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

The outcome variable was , defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30kg/. Retail food outlets were classified as: supermarkets and establishments with a predominance of healthy, unhealthy, and mixed foods. Settings for physical activity were categorized as public and private. Characterization of the social environment used the census tracts' per capita income in tertiles and the crime rate. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed according to the generalized estimating equations model. An inverse association was found between density of public and private locations for physical activity and  (OR = 0.95, 95%CI: 0.92-0.99; OR = 0.98, 95%CI: 0.97-0.99) in models adjusted by individual and environmental variables. In all the models, the highest per capita income tertile was inversely associated with  (p ≤ 0.05). The food environment and crime rates were not independently associated with .

FFM4C was compared with SMM measured by magnetic resonance imaging.BIA and DXA overestimated and ADP underestimated FFM in comparison to 3C and 4C models with increasing BMI (all p < 0.001). -Differences were largest for DXA. In , BIA results were improved: valuecorrected = -valueuncorrected - a(BMI - 30 kg/), a = 0.256 for FFM and a = 0.298 for SMM. SMM accounts for 45% of FFM in women and 49% in men.In , the use of FFM is limited by a systematic error of reference methods. In addition, SMM accounts for about 50% of FFM only.

Higher N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is associated with increased risk of incident HF, but little information is available in black individuals. We examined race-specific differences in 1) the association of NT-proBNP with incident HF and 2) the predictive ability of NT-proBNP for incident HF across body mass index (BMI) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) categories.In a prospective case-cohort study, baseline NT-proBNP was measured among 687 participants with incident HF and 2,923 (weighted 20,075) non-case randomly selected participants. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to assess the objectives of our study. Global Wald Chi-square score estimated from multivariable Cox models was used to assess predictive ability of NT-proBNP across BMI and eGFR categories.In the multivariable model, a doubling of NT-proBNP concentration was associated with greater risk of incident HF among white individuals [hazard ratio (HR): 1.73; 95% CI: 1.55-1.94] than black individuals (HR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.34-1.70); Pinteraction by race = 0.024. Higher NT-proBNP was the strongest predictor of incident HF across all BMI and eGFR categories among white individuals. By contrast, among black individuals with  (BMI ≥ 30 kg/) or eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 , the predictive ability of NT-proBNP for incident HF was attenuated.The magnitude of the association of higher NT-proBNP with incident HF risk was greater among white individuals than black individuals. The diminished ability of NT-proBNP to predict the risk of HF in black population with  or impaired kidney function highlights the need of further investigations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513002>Bone Mineral Density Assessment By DXA Vs. QCT In Postmenopausal Females With Central .</a></h2><p>Although dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is gold standard for osteoporosis diagnosis, several reports have shown discordant T-score values measured by quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and DXA especially in obese subjects, but it is still not clear whether BMD measurement by two modalities is affected by overall  or central  in postmenopausal females. Therefore, the aims of this study were to compare BMD and T-scores by DXA and QCT and to evaluate whether these two osteoporosis assessment modalities yield different T-score values in postmenopausal females with  and central .This cross-sectional study enrolled 44 postmenopausal females, referred for osteoporosis screening. Anthropometric indices (BMI-body mass index, WC-waist circumference and ICO-index of central ) were measured and females underwent assessment of bone mineral density by DXA and QCT.Lumbar spine (LS) T-score values were significantly lower by DXA compared to qCT in females with BMI >25 kg/, (-1.9±1.5 vs. -2.3±1.2; p=0.039), in females with WC>88 cm(-1.9±1.5 vs. -2.4±1.2; p=0.008) and in females with ICO>0.5(-1.96±1.4 vs. -2.5±1.2; p=0.004). However, in normal weight females and in those without central , LS T-scores by DXA were not different than qCT. DXA at lumbar spine and proximal femur revealed osteoporosis in 47.7% and 11.4% respectively, while QCT detected osteoporosis in 61.4% of females (p<0.001). Measures of central ; ICO and WC were not associated with QCT bone mineral density (BMD) (r=0.14 and r=0.21, respectively), but were positively associated both with DXALS BMD (r=0.29 and r=0.31; p<0.05) and DXA proximal femur BMD (r=0.41 and r=0.44; p<0.01).Our results suggest that  is associated with lower T-scores by DXA compared to QCT. Caution is needed when assessing osteoporosis status in obese postmenopausal females.

There is a growing evidence of increasing prevalence of  among Saudi women across all age groups (44%). Since the prognostic significance of  was not studied in Saudi patients with breast cancer, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of BMI on pCR in LABC patients post NAC.This is a retrospective study between May 2005 to July 2010; 246 consecutive female patients who were diagnosed of LABC (Stage II & III) and underwent surgery in three tertiary care centers, representative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (King Saud Medical City, Riyadh; King Abdullah Hospital, Mecca and King Fahad Specialist Hospital, Dammam) were included in this study. All included patients have received NAC (Anthracycline/Taxane based combination chemotherapy and ± Herceptin). Patients who were diagnosed to have stage IV breast cancer due to presence of distant metastasis were excluded. Patients were categorized as normal (BMI <25 kg/), overweight (BMI of 25 to <30 kg/) and obese (BMI >30 kg/). pCR was defined as no invasive cancer in the breast or axillary tissue. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to evaluate the statistical associations between pCR and BMI with respect to the other previously established prognostic factors, namely age, tumor grade, stage, ER/ PR /Her-2neu status, molecular subtypes, and lympho-vascular invasion (LVI).The median age was 50 years (range 24-68). Molecular subtypes were as follows: luminal A; 23.2%, luminal B; 45.1%, triple negative; 16.7% and Her-2 neu positive; 15%. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma represents the majority of our cohort (92.7%). Eighty-six (35%) were stage II and 160 (65%) were stage III. Intermediate and high-grade malignancies were found in 52% and 44.3% of the patients respectively. Positive lymph vascular invasion was detected in 41.5%. Obese patients constitute 55.7% of our cohort. Pathologic complete response was achieved in 62 patients (25.2%). In Univariate analysis LVI and overweight / were negatively correlated with pCR (P= 0.037 and 0.000 respectively) while tumor grade was positively correlated with pCR (P= 0.008). In multivariate analysis, Overweight/  was the only significant independent factor correlating with pCR (P=0.000). No impact of BMI has been demonstrated on both disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) (P=0.93, 0.18 respectively).In this study, Overweight/ (which represent more than half of the patients =81.3 %) had a negative impact on pCR in Saudi patients with LABC treated with NAC. This poorer outcome in patients with abnormal weight (Overweight/) necessitates further prospective studies of this risk factor in order to optimize the care of this group of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550265>Association of  with heart failure outcomes in 11 Asian regions: A cohort study.</a></h2><p>Asians are predisposed to a lean heart failure (HF) phenotype. Data on the ' paradox', reported in Western populations, are scarce in Asia and have only utilised the traditional classification of body mass index (BMI). We aimed to investigate the association between  (defined by BMI and abdominal measures) and HF outcomes in Asia.Utilising the Asian Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure (ASIAN-HF) registry (11 Asian regions including Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Japan, and Korea; 46 centres with enrolment between 1 October 2012 and 6 October 2016), we prospectively examined 5,964 patients with symptomatic HF (mean age 61.3 ± 13.3 years, 26% women, mean BMI 25.3 ± 5.3 kg/, 16% with HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF; ejection fraction ≥ 50%]), among whom 2,051 also had waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) measurements (mean age 60.8 ± 12.9 years, 24% women, mean BMI 25.0 ± 5.2 kg/, 7% HFpEF). Patients were categorised by BMI quartiles or WHtR quartiles or 4 combined groups of BMI (low, <24.5 kg/ [lean], or high, ≥24.5 kg/ [obese]) and WHtR (low, <0.55 [thin], or high, ≥0.55 [fat]). Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine a 1-year composite outcome (HF hospitalisation or mortality). Across BMI quartiles, higher BMI was associated with lower risk of the composite outcome (ptrend < 0.001). Contrastingly, higher WHtR was associated with higher risk of the composite outcome. Individuals in the lean-fat group, with low BMI and high WHtR (13.9%), were more likely to be women (35.4%) and to be from low-income countries (47.7%) (predominantly in South/Southeast Asia), and had higher prevalence of diabetes (46%), worse quality of life scores (63.3 ± 24.2), and a higher rate of the composite outcome (51/232; 22%), compared to the other groups (p < 0.05 for all). Following multivariable adjustment, the lean-fat group had higher adjusted risk of the composite outcome (hazard ratio 1.93, 95% CI 1.17-3.18, p = 0.01), compared to the obese-thin group, with high BMI and low WHtR. Results were consistent across both HF subtypes (HFpEF and HF with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF]; pinteraction = 0.355). Selection bias and residual confounding are potential limitations of such multinational observational registries.In this cohort of Asian patients with HF, the ' paradox' is observed only when defined using BMI, with WHtR showing the opposite association with the composite outcome. Lean-fat patients, with high WHtR and low BMI, have the worst outcomes. A direct correlation between high WHtR and the composite outcome is apparent in both HFpEF and HFrEF.Asian Sudden Cardiac Death in HF (ASIAN-HF) Registry ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31454363>Nutrition status of nulliparous married Indian women 15-24 years: Decadal trends, predictors and program implications.</a></h2><p>In India, 66% of 8 million married adolescents (~5.3 million) are nulliparous and likely to conceive soon. Among married young women aged 20-24 years about 9.1 million are nulliparous. This group remains relatively less reached in maternal nutrition programs. Current estimates of their nutritional status and predictors of body mass index (BMI) are unavailable. Thinness (BMI <18.5 kg/), severe thinness (BMI <16 kg/), overweight or  (BMI ≥ 23kg/) prevalence estimates are presented based on a sample of 11,265 married nulliparous adolescents (15-19 years, married, no parity) and 15,358 young women (20-24 years, married, no parity) drawn from the National Family Health Surveys 2005-06 and 2015-16. Trends by age, time and state were analysed. Predictors of BMI were investigated using linear regression. Using BMI for age z score (BAZ) as standard reference, BMI cut-off was calculated for thinness (-2SD) and overweight or  (+1SD) among married nulliparous adolescents as recommended for population under 19 years. 35% sampled adolescents and 26% young women were thin; 4%-5% severely thin. Overweight or  was higher among married nulliparous young women than married nulliparous adolescents (21% versus 11%). Eight in 1000 were short, thin and young and six in 1000 were short, thin, anemic and young. At 15 years of age, prevalence of thinness based on BMI was 46.5% while based on BAZ, 7.6%. At 24 years of age thinness was 22.5%. Decadal reduction in thinness was half among married nulliparous adolescents (4% points) compared with married nulliparous young women (8% points). Decadal increase in overweight/  ranged from 4% to 5% in both age groups. Western states had high prevalence of thinness; Tamil Nadu had highest prevalence of overweight or .

BMI cut-off 16.49 kg/ and 24.12 kg/ had a high sensitivity (100%, 99.7%) and specificity (98.9%, 98.5%) to screen thin and overweight or obese adolescents, respectively. Owing to the high prevalence of both thinness and overweight/ among nulliparous married adolescents and women, nutritional anthropometry based screening should be initiated for this target group, along with a treatment package in states with high and persistent malnutrition.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the long-term effects of SG on T2DM remission with remission seen after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or gastric banding (GB).A literature search was performed in PubMed and Cochrane Library using the following search terms: 'sleeve gastrectomy', 'diabetes', 'gastric bypass' and 'gastric banding'. Studies published between January 2000 and April 2018, and with following inclusion criteria were selected for this review: BMI ≥ 35 kg/, age ≥ 18 years, follow-up ≥ 1 year, T2DM. Data was statistically analysed using a random-effects model and results were expressed as odds ratio with 95% confidence interval.After exclusion, 35 out of an initial 748 studies, consisting of 18 138 T2DM patients, remained for inclusion. Of these patients, 2480 underwent a SG. The remaining patients underwent a RYGB (n = 10,597) or GB (n = 5061). One year postoperatively, SG patients reached significantly (OR 0.71, p = 0.003) less T2DM remission than RYGB. After stratifying for different criteria for remission, RYGB still tended to result in higher remission rates, but the difference was not statistically significant. Beyond 1 year of follow-up, the difference between RYGB and SG in terms of T2DM remission decreased. SG was superior to the GB (OR 2.17, p = 0.001) after 1 year of follow-up.This review demonstrates important remission of T2DM following SG.

This study evaluated whether C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammation biomarker, mediated the effects of growth (annual increase) in body mass index (BMI) on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).BMI and biomarker data were used from wave I to wave IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health study; 4,545 adolescents; mean age = 14.9 years; 55.7% female) with valid CRP data. A causal moderated mediation analysis evaluated the direct and indirect effects of BMI slope on HbA1c via CRP across gender, with demographic and clinical characteristics as model covariates.The participants displayed a linear BMI growth of 0.53-0.58 kg//year throughout adolescence, with substantial interindividual variation. The BMI slope showed positive direct and indirect effects on HbA1c via CRP across gender, and there was a significant exposure-mediator interaction effect. A standardized increase in the BMI slope raised the probability of an abnormal HbA1c value by 6.0-8.5% in participants with various profiles. The total natural indirect effect accounted for 13.3-15.9% of the total effect in males and 21.2-22.7% in females.The findings provide support for the inflammation mechanism in the effects of adiposity on glucose homeostasis. In adolescents, excess BMI growth was linked with a higher risk of glucose dysregulation either directly or indirectly via chronic inflammation.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

However, prior studies included limited cancer deaths and had inconsistent findings. Therefore, we evaluated insulin resistance and cancer-specific and all-cause mortality in postmenopausal women participating in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI).Eligible were a subsample of 22 837 WHI participants aged 50-79 years enrolled at 40 US clinical centers from 1993 to 1998 who had baseline fasting glucose and insulin levels. Baseline insulin resistance was measured by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Cancers were verified by central medical record review and deaths verified by medical record and death certificate review enhanced by National Death Index queries. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. All statistical tests were two-sided.During a median of 18.9 years of follow-up, 1820 cancer deaths and 7415 total deaths occurred. Higher HOMA-IR quartile was associated with higher cancer-specific mortality (Q4 vs Q1, HR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.47; Ptrend = .003) and all-cause mortality (Q4 vs Q1, HR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.51 to 1.76; Ptrend < .001). A sensitivity analysis for diabetes status did not change findings. Among women with body mass index less than 25 kg/, higher HOMA-IR quartile was associated with higher cancer mortality (Fine and Gray, P = .004).High insulin resistance, as measured by HOMA-IR, identifies postmenopausal women at higher risk for cancer-specific and all-cause mortality who could potentially benefit from early intervention.© The Author(s) 2019.

Women were divided into groups according to the result of OGTT (GDM/no GDM) and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI): normal weight (≤24.9 kg/), overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/), and obese (≥30.0 kg/). Primary outcomes included macrosomia, caesarean delivery, and treatment at neonatal ward. Normal weight women without GDM constituted the reference group.Compared to reference group, overweight or obese women without GDM had an increased risk of macrosomia [odds ratio adjusted for age, parity, smoking and socio-economic status (aOR)1.18 (95% CI 1.09-1.28) and 1.50 (95% CI 1.19-1.88)], and caesarean delivery [aORs 1.17 (95% CI 1.07-1.28) and 1.52 (95% CI 1.37-1.69)], respectively. In normal weight GDM women the risk of macrosomia [aOR 1.17 (95% CI 0.85-1.62)] and caesarean delivery [aOR 1.10 (95% CI 0.96-1.27)] was not significantly increased as compared to normal weight women without GDM. GDM increased the risk of treatment at neonatal ward in all BMI categories and maternal  without GDM was also a risk factor for treatment at neonatal ward. Interaction p values between BMI and GDM on these outcomes were <0.001.Maternal overweight and  without GDM increased the risk of macrosomia and caesarean delivery when compared to the reference group. These risks were amplified when overweight/ was accompanied by GDM.  without GDM was a risk factor for treatment at neonatal ward; GDM increased this risk in all BMI categories.

The primary analyses consisted of 9-10 year olds divided into a training (n = 2724) and test (n = 1123) sets. Secondary analyses were conducted by sex, ethnicity, and race.The full sample model captured 12% of the variance in both the training and test sets, suggesting good generalizability. Stimulant medications and demographic factors were most strongly associated with BMI. Lower attention problems and matrix reasoning (i.e. nonverbal abstract problem solving and inductive reasoning) and higher social problems and screen time were robust positive correlates in the primary analyses and in analyses separated by sex.Beyond demographics and stimulant use, this study highlights abstract reasoning as an important cognitive variable and reaffirms social problems and screen time as significant correlates of BMI and as modifiable therapeutic targets. Prospective data are needed to understand the predictive power of these variables for BMI gain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505515>The Determinants of the Preferred Walking Speed in Individuals with .</a></h2><p>The preferred walking speed (PWS), also known as the "spontaneous" or "self-selected" walking speed, is the speed normally used during daily living activities and may represent an appropriate exercise intensity for weight reduction programs aiming to enhance a more negative energy balance.The aim of this study was to examine, simultaneously, the energetics, mechanics, and perceived exertion determinants of PWS in individuals with .Twenty-three adults with  (age 32.7 ± 6.8 years, body mass index 33.6 ± 2.6 kg/) were recruited. The participants performed 10 min of treadmill familiarization, and PWS was determined. Each subject performed six 5-min walking trials (PWS 0.56, 0.83, 1.11, 1.39, and 1.67 m/s). Gas exchanges were collected and analyzed to obtain the gross energy cost of walking (GCw), rated perceived exertion (RPE) was measured using a 6-20 Borg scale, and the external mechanical work (Wext) and the fraction of mechanical energy recovered by the pendular mechanism (Recovery) were computed using an instrumented treadmill. Second-order least-squares regression was used to calculate the optimal walking speed (OWS) of each variable.No significant difference was found between PWS (1.28 ± 0.13 m/s) and OWS for GCw (1.28 ± 0.10 m/s), RPE cost of walking (1.38 ± 0.14 m/s), and Recovery (1.48 ± 0.27 m/s; p > 0.06 for all), but the PWS was significantly faster than the OWS for Wext (0.98 ± 0.56 m/s; p < 0.02). Multiple regression (r = 0.72; p = 0.003) showed that ∼52% of the variance in PWS was explained by Recovery, Wext, and height.The main finding of this study was that obese adults may select their PWS in function of several competing demands, since this speed simultaneously minimizes pendular energy transduction, energy cost, and perceived exertion during walking. Moreover, recovery of mechanical work, external work, and height seem to be the major determinants of PWS in these individuals.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

This nonrandomized, therapeutic, open, single-arm study investigated the effects of progressive resistance training (PRT) on  indices in women with PCOS, and the relationship between  indices and telomere content.A total of 45 women with PCOS and 52 with non-PCOS (controls), aged 18 to 37 years, with body mass indexes of 18 to 39.9 kg/, performed three 1-hour sessions of PRT per week, for 16 weeks. Before and after PRT, measures included anthropometric indices and regions of interest of fat mass distribution, quantified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, metabolic and hormonal parameters, and telomere content. The general linear mixed models were used to determine the effects of PRT.PRT did reduce the waist-to-height ratio, waist circumference, and the index of conicity among PCOS (P < .01). However, PRT did not influence regions of interest, body mass index, and WHR. After PRT, the telomere content was associated with regions of interest and anthropometric indices in whole group independent of PCOS (P < .05).Resistance exercise improves  indices in PCOS, independent of changes in body weight, and the relationship between telomeres and  parameters in PCOS remain to be fully clarified.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31237934>Maternal pre-pregnancy  and timing of puberty in sons and daughters: a population-based cohort study.</a></h2><p>In many countries, an increased prevalence of  in pregnancy has coincided with a declining pubertal age. We aimed to explore the potential effect of maternal pre-pregnancy overweight and  on timing of puberty in sons and daughters.Between 2012 and 2018, 15 819 of 22 439 invited children from the Danish National Birth Cohort, born 2000-03, provided half-yearly information from the age of 11 years on the pubertal milestones: Tanner stages, voice break, first ejaculation, menarche, acne and axillary hair. We estimated adjusted mean monthly differences (with 95% confidence intervals) in age at attaining the pubertal milestones for children exposed to maternal pre-pregnancy  [body mass index (BMI) ≥30.0 kg/] or overweight (BMI 25.0 to 29.9 kg/) with normal weight (BMI 18.5 to 24.9 kg/) as reference. In mediation analysis, we explored whether childhood BMI at age 7 years mediated the associations.Maternal pre-pregnancy  was associated with earlier age at attaining most pubertal milestones in sons, and pre-pregnancy overweight and  were associated with earlier age at attaining all pubertal milestones in daughters. When combining all pubertal milestones, pre-pregnancy  [sons: -1.5 (-2.5, -0.4) months; daughters: -3.2 (-4.2, -2.1) months] and overweight [daughters only: -2.6 (-3.3, -1.8) months] were associated with earlier timing of puberty. The associations in sons were completely mediated by higher childhood BMI and partly so in daughters.Maternal pre-pregnancy  appears to lower timing of puberty through childhood  in sons and mainly through other mechanisms in daughters.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, treatment modalities targeting ATMs remain limited. The effects of lycopene, an antioxidant carotenoid compound, on adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance in high fat (HF)-diet-induced obese mice are examined.C57BL/6J mice are fed an HF diet or an HF diet containing lycopene (HF+LY) for 8 weeks. Lycopene attenuates HF-diet-induced glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia. Compared with HF mice, HF+LY mice exhibit attenuated adipocyte hypertrophy and macrophage infiltration in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Flow cytometry analysis of ATMs demonstrates that lycopene attenuated the increased number of ATMs in HF diet-fed mice. In addition, HF+LY mice have 23% fewer M1-polarized ATMs and 60% more -polarized ATMs than HF mice, resulting in the predominance of  over M1 in the ATM population. -dominant polarization is also seen in hepatic macrophages in HF+LY mice. Moreover, lycopene promotes IL-4-induced  polarization by increasing the phosphorylation levels of STAT6 and Akt in Raw 264.7 macrophages.Lycopene facilitates -dominant polarization in ATM, thereby attenuating HF diet-induced inflammation and insulin resistance in eWAT and the liver.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Defining novel costeffective protocols is important for reducing treatment costs. The study aimed to assess if Capacitive and Resistive Energy Transfer (TECAR) can reduce edema and the minimum number of sessions needed to observe volume reduction. Forty-eight severely obese subjects (age range: 46-78 years; BMI >40 kg/) with bilateral lower limb lymphedema were divided into three groups undergoing either manual lymphatic drainage, pressure therapy, or TECAR, in addition to a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program. They were compared to a control group composed by 12 women (age: 67.4 ± 8.9 years, BMI: 44.6 ± 4.1 Kg/) undergoing only the rehabilitation program. A handheld laser scanner 3D system was used for volume measurements. In addition, patients were evaluated with a Timed Up and Go (TUG) test and pain/heaviness of the lower limbs with a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). A significant volume reduction was observed after 6 sessions of TECAR: specifically, in the whole limb (PRE: 9.7+2.8 dm3; POST: 9.4+2.8 dm3; p<0.05) and in the thigh (PRE: 3.5+1.3 dm3; POST: 3.3+1.2 dm3; p<0.05). The TUG and VAS for pain showed a significant improvement in all groups. Our preliminary results suggest that TECAR can provide a relatively early reduction of lower limb edema with improvement of patients' function and pain.Copyright by International Society of Lymphology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31119286>Clustering-based characterization of clinical phenotypes in obstructive sleep apnoea using severity, , and craniofacial pattern.</a></h2><p>To identify and characterize the phenotypes of adult obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) patients based on clustering using OSA severity, , and craniofacial pattern.The samples consisted of 89 adult OSA patients whose polysomnography and lateral cephalogram were available.

Mice were fed an HFD to induce  and then administered PF. Body weight, epididymal fat and liver weight, glucose, lipid, insulin, and histologic characteristics were evaluated to determine the effect of PF on insulin resistance by analyzing the proportion of macrophages in epididymal fat and liver and measured inflammatory gene expression. PF administration significantly decreased the fasting and postprandial glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, total-cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The epididymal fat tissue and liver showed a significant decrease of fat accumulation in histological analysis. PF significantly reduced the number of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs), F4/80 Kupffer cells, and CD68 Kupffer cells, increased the proportion of  phenotype macrophages, and decreased the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines.

Thirty-day mortality and short-term complications were documented as well as long-term complications that were pooled into major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and included myocardial infarction, stroke, repeated CABG, percutaneous coronary intervention with or without stenting, and death. After pooling the study groups, survival and freedom from MACCE plots (Kaplan- Meier) were generated and Cox regression analysis used to identify predictive factors of survival. Average follow-up time was 5.6 years. Severely obese and obese patients were significantly younger than those with a normal BMI, more often males with identifiable risk factors of coronary artery disease (CAD) and a lower EuroSCORE II (1.6 vs. 2.7, p=0.002). The incidence of major early complications, 30-day mortality (2%), long-term survival (90% at 5 years, log-rank test p=0.088) and MACCE-free survival (81% at 5 years, log-rank test p=0.7) was similar for obese and non-obese patients.

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis suggested that breast tissue macrophages from obese versus lean women are more similar to tumor-associated macrophages. These changes positively correlated with adipose tissue interstitial fibrosis, and in vitro experiments indicated that obese ECM directly stimulates -biased macrophage functions. However, mammographic density cannot be used as a clinical indicator of these changes. Collectively, these data suggest that -associated interstitial fibrosis promotes a macrophage phenotype similar to tumor-associated macrophages, which may contribute to the link between  and breast cancer.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

This study examined secular trends in  prevalence by socioeconomic position and the resulting  inequalities in the German adult population.Data were drawn from three national examination surveys conducted in 1990-1992, 1997-1999 and 2008-2011 (n = 18,541; age range: 25-69 years).  was defined by a body mass index ≥30 kg/ using standardised measurements of body height and weight. Education and equivalised household disposable income were used as indicators of socioeconomic position. Time trends in socioeconomic inequalities in  were examined using linear probability and log-binomial regression models.In each survey period, the highest socioeconomic groups had the lowest prevalence of . The low and medium socioeconomic groups showed increases in  prevalence, whereas no such trend was observed in the high socioeconomic groups. Absolute inequalities in  by income increased by an average of 0.53 percentage points per year (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01-1.05, p = 0.047) among men and 0.47 percentage points per year (95% CI 0.05-0.90, p = 0.029) among women. Absolute inequalities in  by education increased on average by 0.64 percentage points per year (95% CI 0.19-1.08, p = 0.005) among women but not among men (0.33 percentage points, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.92, p = 0.283).These findings suggest a widening  gap between the top and the bottom of the socioeconomic spectrum. This has the potential to have adverse consequences for population health and health inequalities in coming decades.

Thus, knowledge of how , or more specifically total body fat percentage (TBF) and body mass index (BMI), affect measurements that are used to detect or track lymphedema is clinically important. Tissue dielectric constant (TDC) is one measure used to help characterize lymphedema features, detect its presence, and assess treatment-related changes. The goal of this research was to determine the extent to which TDC values depend on TBF and BMI. TDC was measured on both forearms (2.5mm depth) in 250 women (18-72 years) along with TBF (impedance, 50KHz). TBF was 12.2%- 54.4% (median=29.3%) and BMI was 14.7Kg/-44.3 Kg/ (median=22.6 Kg/). TDC values and interarm ratios were compared between subgroups that had TBF and BMI values in lower vs. upper quartiles. Subjects in the upper quartile had slightly lower TDC values (1.3 TDC units, p <0.01) that was at most a 5% differential. Contrastingly, TDC interarm ratios were not dependent on TBF or BMI levels. These findings suggest that when tracking lymphedema changes using the TDC method, treatment-related or temporal changes in a woman's TBF or BMI are unlikely to significantly impact TDC values or their interarm ratios.Copyright by International Society of Lymphology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659983>The  Paradox Revisited: Body Mass Index and Long-Term Outcomes After PCI From a Large Pooled Patient-Level Database.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous revascularization.In 13 randomized trials 22,922 patients were stratified (in kg/) as underweight (BMI &lt;18.5), normal weight (18.5≤BMI&lt;25, used as reference), overweight (25≤BMI&lt;30), and obese (Class I [30≤BMI&lt;35], Class II [35≤BMI&lt;40], or Class III [BMI≥40]).

The purpose of this review was to analyse comparative data on these three procedures to aid patient and procedure selection for patients seeking Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery (BMS).We examined published English language scientific literature available on PubMed for data comparing SG, RYGB, and OAGB for various groups of patients.There are a number of variables that can influence patient and procedure selection for individuals seeking BMS. High-quality data comparing each of these procedures for every patient subgroup, for each possible outcome measure is lacking. It is, therefore, not currently possible to make strict recommendations regarding patient and procedure selection. At the same time, the multidisciplinary teams should understand that risks of surgery may simply be too high for some patients - such as those suffering from end-stage organ disease and those suffering from mega  (BMI ≥ 70 kg/). Surgery should only be offered to such high-risk groups in dedicated centres with appropriate expertise. For other patients, surgeons should carefully consider the pros and cons of each procedure, their own experience, and patient preferences before deciding the most appropriate BMS procedure for them.This review examines various factors influencing patient and procedure selection in bariatric surgery.

Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: control (CT), obese induced by high-calorie diet (DIO) and DIO treated with exenatide (DIO + E). [H]Quinuclidinyl benzilate specific binding analysis showed that the equilibrium dissociation constant (K) did not differ among CT, DIO and DIO + E, indicating that affinity is not affected by high-calorie diet or its treatment with exenatide. On the other hand, the density of mAChRs obtained in DIO animals was lower than that obtained from CT rats, and that DIO + E restored the density of mAChRs. Immunoprecipitation assays reveal a decrease in the expression of M and M subtypes of DIO animals when compared with CT. Treatment with exenatide (DIO + E) restored the expression of the two subtypes similar to obtained from CT. On the other hand, the M, M and M mAChR subtypes expression did not differ among CT, DIO and DIO + E. Carbacol caused a concentration-dependent increase in the accumulation of total [H] inositol phosphate in CT, DIO and DIO + E. However, the magnitude of the maximal response to carbachol was lower in DIO when compared with those obtained from CT and DIO + E animals, which did not differ from each other. Our results indicate that  induced by high-calorie diet strongly influences the expression and intracellular signaling coupled to M-M mAChR subtypes. The exenatide ameliorated these effects, suggesting an important role on hippocampal muscarinic cholinergic system. This action of  induced by high-calorie diet and its treatment with exenatide might be a key step mediating cellular events important for learning and memory.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We previously reported that in adolescent girls at-risk for T2D with moderately elevated depression, randomization to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) produced greater decreases in depression at post-treament and greater decreases in fasting/2-h insulin at 1 year, compared to health education (HE). The current study is a secondary analysis of this parallel-group randomized controlled trial. We examined whether decreasing depression explained intervention effects on body composition and insulin outcomes. We hypothesized that decreases in depression would be an explanatory mediator and that indirect effects would be strongest at higher levels of baseline depression.Participants were 12-17 years girls with overweight/ and family history of T2D randomized to 6-week group CBT (n = 58) or HE (n = 61). Procedures took place at an outpatient pediatric clinic. At baseline, post-treatment, and 1 year, adolescents completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale to assess depression symptoms; body mass index (BMI [kg/]) was measured from height/fasting weight; insulin resistance was derived from 2-h oral glucose testing. Adiposity was assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and 1 year. Indirect effects of intervention were tested on 1-year changes in BMI, adiposity, and insulin through decreases in depression. Baseline depression was tested as a moderator of mediation.There was an indirect effect of CBT on decreased 1-year fasting insulin via decreases in depression during treatment, among adolescents with more elevated baseline depression.Decreasing elevated depression may be one mechanism in the targeted prevention of T2D in at-risk adolescents.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Pediatric Psychology 2019.

We retrospectively analyzed how BMI trajectories during the transition to adulthood were associated with a measure of pain interference obtained at age 29 in a longitudinal birth cohort study.Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 Cohort (follow-up from 1997 to 2015), were used to determine BMI trajectories from age 14 to 29 via group trajectory modeling. At age 29, respondents described whether pain interfered with their work inside and outside the home over the past four weeks (not at all, a little, or a lot). Multivariable ordinal logistic regression was used to evaluate pain interference according to BMI trajectory and study covariates.Among 7,875 respondents, 11% reported "a little" and 4% reported "a lot" of pain interference at age 29. Four BMI trajectory groups were identified, varying in starting BMI and rate of weight gain. The "obese" group (8% of respondents) had a starting BMI of 30 kg/ and gained an average of 0.7 kg//y. On multivariable analysis, this group was the most likely to have greater pain interference, compared with "high normal weight" (odds ratio [OR] = 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.14-1.88), "low normal weight" (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.13-1.87), and "overweight" trajectories (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.02-1.73). and rapid weight gain during the transition to adulthood were associated with higher risk of pain interference among young adults.© 2019 American Academy of Pain Medicine.

Metabolite profiling offers an opportunity to systematically discover new predictors for weight gain that are relatively easy to measure compared to traditional approaches.Using baseline metabolite profiling data of middle-aged individuals from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS; n = 1,508), we identified 42 metabolites associated (p < 0.05) with longitudinal change in body mass index (BMI). We performed stepwise linear regression to select 8 of these metabolites to build a metabolite risk score (MRS) for predicting future weight gain. We replicated the MRS using data from the Mexico City Diabetes Study (MCDS; n = 768), in which one standard deviation increase in the MRS corresponded to ~0.03 increase in BMI (kg/) per year (i.e. ~0.09 kg/year for a 1.7 m adult). We observed that none of the available anthropometric, lifestyle, and glycemic variables fully account for the MRS prediction of weight gain. Surprisingly, we found the MRS to be strongly correlated with baseline insulin sensitivity in both cohorts and to be negatively predictive of T2D in MCDS. Genome-wide association study of the MRS identified 2 genome-wide (p < 5 × 10-8) and 5 suggestively (p < 1 × 10-6) significant loci, several of which have been previously linked to -related phenotypes.We have constructed and validated a generalizable MRS for future weight gain that is an independent predictor distinct from several other known risk factors. The MRS captures a composite biological picture of weight gain, perhaps hinting at the anabolic effects of preserved insulin sensitivity.

MerTK is mainly expressed in anti-inflammatory  macrophages where it mediates transcriptional changes including suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancement of inflammatory repressors. MerTK is regulated by metabolic pathways through nuclear sensors including LXRs, PPARs, and RXRs, in response to apoptotic bodies or to other sources of cholesterol. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. It is a clinicopathological syndrome closely related to , insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. It includes a spectrum of conditions ranging from simple steatosis, characterized by hepatic fat accumulation with or without inflammation, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), defined by hepatic fat deposition with hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and accumulating fibrosis. Several studies support an association between NAFLD and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, a major cause of death worldwide. This pathological condition consists in a chronic and progressive inflammatory process in the intimal layer of large- and medium-sized arteries. The complications of advanced atherosclerosis include chronic or acute ischemic damage in the tissue perfused by the affected artery, leading to cellular death. By identifying specific targets influencing lipid metabolism and cardiovascular-related diseases, the present review highlights the role of MerTK in NAFLD-associated atherosclerotic lesions as a potential innovative therapeutic target. Therapeutic advantages might derive from the use of compounds selective for nuclear receptors targeting PPARs rather than LXRs regulating macrophage lipid metabolism and macrophage mediated inflammation, by favoring the expression of MerTK, which mediates an immunoregulatory action with a reduction in inflammation and in atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31482976>Validation of the two-minute step test in obese with comorbibities and morbidly obese patients.</a></h2><p>Cardiopulmonary fitness assessment is a valuable resource to obtain quantitative indicators of an individual's physical performance. The cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX), considered the gold standard test for this evaluation, is costly and difficult to be accessed by the general population. In order to make this evaluation more accessible, and to better reflect the performance of daily life activities, alternative tests were proposed. Morbidly obese patients present limitations that impair physical performance assessment and could benefit from a test of shorter duration, provided it is validated. This observational study aimed to validate the two-minute step test (2MST) as a tool to evaluate functional capacity (FC) in obese with comorbidities and morbidly obese patients, compared the 2MST with CPX as a measure of physical performance, and developed a predictive equation to estimate peak oxygen uptake (VO2) in the 2MST. The CPX and the 2MST were performed and metabolic and ventilatory parameters were recorded in 31 obese individuals (BMI>35 kg/). Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the peak VO2 best predictors. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to assess the agreement between the two methods. Peak VO2 measured by CPX and 2MST showed a strong correlation (r=0.70, P<0.001) and there was a moderate correlation between peak VO2 of the 2MST and the number of up-and-down step cycles (UDS) (r=0.55; P=0.01). The reference equation obtained was: VO2 (mL·kg-1·min-1) = 13.341 + 0.138 × total UDS - (0.183 × BMI), with an estimated standard error of 1.3 mL·kg-1·min-1.

Thus, this study investigates the effects of adzuki beans on  and gut microbiota in high fat diet-induced mice.In this study, adzuki bean hot water extract (AWE) is determined to have the most significant anti-adipogenic effect; it is able to inhibit lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and reduces body weight and adipose tissue weight in a dose-dependent manner. AWE treatment also decreases M1-polarized adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) while inducing -polarized ATMs. The number and size of fat vacuoles in liver lesions are significantly reduced, indicating that AWE could ameliorate steatosis in high fat diet-induced mice. The results also demonstrate that AWE-treated groups inhibit adipogenesis via activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and reduce peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins α expression. Moreover, the studies confirm that AWE decreases  through modulating gut microbiota.The results demonstrate that AWE supplementation ameliorates high fat diet-induced  and gut microbiota composition and suggests that AWE may have the potential to be developed into a functional food to improve metabolic disorders.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

During aging, chronic inflammation increases proportional to visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass and associates with escalating morbidity and mortality. Here, we utilize a mouse model to investigate the inflammatory status of visceral adipose tissue in lean aging mice and assess the effects of exercise training interventions. We randomized adult (11 months; n = 21) and old (23 months; n = 27) mice to resistance training (RT) or endurance training (ET), or to a sedentary control group (S). Strikingly, we observed an anti-inflammatory phenotype in the old mice, consisting of higher accumulation of  macrophages and IL-10 expression, compared to the adult mice. In concordance, old mice also had less VAT mass and smaller adipocytes compared to adult mice. In both age groups, exercise training enhanced the anti-inflammatory phenotype and increased PGC1-α mRNA expression.

Adipose tissue (AT) plays a crucial role in the development of , promoting the infiltration and accumulation of leukocytes in the tissue and sustaining adipocyte expansion. Anthocyanins exert a broad range of health benefits, but their effect in improving -related inflammation in vivo has been poorly characterized. We examined the effects of a purple corn cob extract in the context of AT inflammation in a murine diet-induced  (DIO) model.Male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to control diet (CTR + HO), high fat diet (HF + HO) or high fat diet plus purple corn extract (HF + RED) for 12 weeks. Blood glucose, AT, and liver gene expression, metabolism, biochemistry, and histology were analysed and flow cytometry was performed on AT leukocytes and Kupffer cells.RED extract intake resulted in lower MCP-1 mediated recruitment and proliferation of macrophages into crown-like structures in the AT. AT macrophages (ATM) of HF + RED group upregulated  markers (ArgI, Fizz1, TGFβ), downregulating inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, COX-2) thanks to the suppression of NF-kB signalling. ATM also increased the expression of iron metabolism-related genes (FABP4, Hmox1, Ferroportin, CD163, TfR1, Ceruloplasmin, FtL1, FtH1) associated with a reduction in iron storage and increased turnover. ATM from HF + RED mice did not respond to LPS treatment ex vivo, confirming the long-lasting effects of the treatment on  polarization. Adipocytes of HF + RED group improved lipid metabolism and displayed a lower inflammation grade. Liver histology revealed a remarkable reduction of steatosis in the HF + RED group, and Kupffer cell profiling displayed a marked switch towards the  phenotype.RED extract attenuated AT inflammation in vivo, with a long-lasting reprogramming of ATM and adipocyte profiles towards the anti-inflammatory phenotype, therefore representing a valuable supplement in the context of -associated disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494654>Effects of Weight Loss on Sweet Taste Preference and Palatability following Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Women with .</a></h2><p>Current evidence suggests that  is associated with alteration of sweet taste perception.

Twenty-seven with  or overweight were assigned to an  (OB) group (BMI: 29.8 ± 0.5 kg/) and 24 to a normal control (NC) group (BMI: 20.9 ± 0.3 kg/). The OB group underwent a 30-week weight loss intervention using CBT-based group therapy. The results of measurement of detection threshold, suprathreshold perceived intensity, preference, and palatability, elements of sweet taste perception, were compared before and after the intervention. Psychological variables and appetite-related hormonal levels were measured.Twenty-three patients and 22 controls completed the study. The OB group showed a 14.6% weight loss after the intervention. At baseline, the OB group preferred significantly higher sucrose concentrations than did the NC group; however, this difference was no longer significant after intervention. In the OB group, persistent pleasure and reduced desire for other taste, measured by repeated exposure to sweetness, normalized after weight loss to levels comparable to those seen in the NC group. No significant difference in discriminative perception of the threshold concentration or the suprathreshold sensory value was found between the two groups before or after intervention. A significant correlation was found between the basal preferred sucrose concentration and the serum leptin level of the OB group after adjusting for confounding factors, such as BMI, depressive symptom score, and trait-anxiety scores.Weight loss induced by CBT-based nonsurgical intervention resulted in the normalization of the sucrose preference and palatability of women with .

However, the behavioral and physiological mechanisms linking sleep and alterations in energy balance and metabolism are incompletely understood. In rodents, sleep regulation is closely related to appropriate brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic activity, but whether the same is true in humans has remained unknown. The present work examines whether sleep duration and quality are related to BAT volume and activity (measured by 18F-FDG) and BAT radiodensity in humans.A total of 118 healthy adults (69% women, 21.9 ± 2.2 years, body mass index: 24.9 ± 4.7 kg/) participated in this cross-sectional study. Sleep duration and other sleep variables were measured using a wrist-worn accelerometer for seven consecutive days for 24 hours per day. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to assess sleep quality. All participants then underwent a personalized cold exposure to determine their BAT volume, activity, and radiodensity (a proxy of the intracellular triglyceride content), using static positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CI) scan.Neither sleep duration nor quality was associated with BAT volume or activity (the latter represented by the mean and peak standardized 18F-FDG uptake values) or radiodensity (all p > .1). The lack of association remained after adjusting the analyses for sex, date of PET/CT, and body composition.Although experiments in rodent models indicate a strong relationship to exist between sleep regulation and BAT function, it seems that sleep duration and quality may not be directly related to the BAT variables examined in the present work.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between POP symptomatology, subjective outcomes of surgery and body mass index (BMI) in women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy for POP.Pre- and postoperative data from a validated pelvic floor questionnaire (electronic Personal Assessment Questionnaire-Pelvic Floor) were collected prospectively from 60 women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy for POP. Of these, 20 were normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/), 20 were overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/), and 20 were women with  (BMI 30-34.9 kg/). The relationship between BMI and symptom scores for prolapse, impact on vaginal symptoms on quality of life (VS-QoL) and 'overall change in condition' was assessed. Pre- and postoperative symptom scores were compared using repeated mixed analysis of variance test for BMI as a categorical variable (normal, overweight, and obese). Spearman rank order correlation test was carried out to evaluate BMI as a continuous variable. All women underwent vaginal hysterectomy using a standardized technique.Overall, 93% of women reported improvement in their condition. The main finding was that 'overall change in condition' was negatively correlated with increasing BMI (rs=-0.324, P=0.028). Irrespective of BMI, significant improvements were observed in symptoms of prolapse and VS-QoL at 3-month postoperation.With increasing BMI, women are likely to report lower levels of satisfaction following prolapse surgery, despite reporting equivalent improvements in symptoms. BMI is known to affect how individuals perceive their general health and well-being with obese individuals reporting poorer levels of subjective health status. Women with  may perceive change in their condition after prolapse surgery differently to women of normal weight.

We also assessed the roles of fat mass and fat-free mass on the same outcomes.Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with BMI and fat mass and fat-free mass indices were used as instrumental variables to estimate the associations with the cardiovascular conditions among 367 703 UK Biobank participants. After correcting for multiple testing, genetically predicted BMI was significantly positively associated with eight outcomes, including and with decreasing magnitude of association: aortic valve stenosis, heart failure, deep vein thrombosis, arterial hypertension, peripheral artery disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and pulmonary embolism. The odds ratio (OR) per 1 kg/ increase in BMI ranged from 1.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.11; P = 2.6 × 10-3] for pulmonary embolism to 1.13 (95% CI 1.05-1.21; P = 1.2 × 10-3) for aortic valve stenosis. There was suggestive evidence of positive associations of genetically predicted fat mass index with nine outcomes (P < 0.05). The strongest magnitude of association was with aortic valve stenosis (OR per 1 kg/ increase in fat mass index 1.46, 95% CI 1.13-1.88; P = 3.9 × 10-3). There was suggestive evidence of inverse associations of fat-free mass index with atrial fibrillation, ischaemic stroke, and abdominal aortic aneurysm.This study provides evidence that higher BMI and particularly fat mass index are associated with increased risk of aortic valve stenosis and most other cardiovascular conditions.© The Author(s) 2019.

A cross-sectional study involving a representative sample of 850 adult quilombolas (18 to 92 years) living in the geographic micro-region of Guanambi, Bahia, Brazil, was conducted. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed between OI [body fat percentage (BF%), body adiposity index (BAI), and body mass index (BMI)] and MetS. The balance between sensitivity and specificity defined the best predictive cutoff points of OI for MetS. The three OIs were predictors of MetS (significant area under ROC curve > 0.5). Among women, BF% showed a significantly greater area under the ROC curve (0.69, 95% CI: 0.65; 0.73) than the other OIs. Among men, the areas for BF%% and BMI were the same (0.81, 95% CI: 0.76; 0.85) and were greater than that of BAI. The best OI cutoff points to identify the presence of MetS in women and men were, respectively: 24.97 and 25.36 kg/ for BMI, 34.30 and 26.14% for BAI, and 37.7 and 23.8% for BF%.

The proportion of African ancestry (PAA), quantified using ADMIXTURE, was higher among self-reported AA (median: 87%; IQR: 79-92%) than among HL (26%; 15-41%) participants. Approximately 18% of AA and 59% of HL participants were non-US-born.Because of significant differences between sexes (PPAA*sex interaction = 4.8 × 10-22), we considered women and men separately. Among women, country of birth and genetic ancestry contributed independently to BMI. US-born women had a BMI 1.99 higher than those born abroad (P = 7.7 × 10-25). Every 10% increase in PAA was associated with a BMI 0.29 higher (P = 7.1 × 10-10). After accounting for PAA and country of birth, the contribution of self-reported ancestry was small (P = 0.046). The contribution of PAA to higher BMI was significantly more pronounced among US-born (0.35/10%PAA, P = 0.003) than among non-US-born (0.26/10%PAA, P = 0.01) women (PPAA*sex interaction = 0.004).

Hence, this study aimed at overweight adolescent boys to explore the effect of high intensity intermittent training (HIIT) on these anti-inflammatory cytokines and body composition parameters. Materials and methods Twenty overweight adolescent boys [aged: 18.0 ± 1.5 years, weight: 81.8 ± 4.3 kg, body mass index (BMI): 27.6 ± 0.8 kg/] completed this study. The subjects were randomly assigned into two groups of control (CG, n = 10) and training (TG, n = 10). Subjects in the TG performed their training sessions 3 days/week for 6 weeks. The baseline serum values of IL-4 and IL-13 and anthropometric features were measured 1 day before the beginning of exercise intervention and 1 day after the last training session in a fasting state. Results Six weeks of HIIT significantly increased the baseline serum levels of IL-4 (p = 0.022) and IL-13 (p = 0.014) in overweight adolescent boys. In addition, body weight (BW), BMI and body fat percent (BF%) were reduced in response to HIIT. Moreover, significantly negative correlations were found between changes of IL-4 and IL-13 with changes of BW, BMI and BF%. Conclusions HIIT seems to be an appropriate exercise modality for overweight adolescent boys to induce an anti-inflammatory cytokine response and, to improve body composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581307>Maternal and perinatal outcomes for women with body mass index ≥50 kg/m in a non-tertiary hospital setting.</a></h2><p> is prevalent in the Australian antenatal population, but there are scarce data on the prevalence and associated outcomes of body mass index (BMI) ≥50 kg/m .To examine the prevalence and outcomes for women with BMI ≥50 kg/m delivering in a non-tertiary hospital.Retrospective cohort study of women delivering a singleton pregnancy in a non-tertiary Victorian hospital during 2011-2016.

Objective To examine the association between TSH and lipids in children with severe . Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of records of children with severe  with simultaneous measurements of TSH and lipids. Children with TSH <0.3 mIU/L and ≥10 mIU/L were excluded. The relationship between TSH and lipids was evaluated using univariate/multiple variable linear and logistic regression. Results The study included 834 children (age 13.8 ± 4.1 years, males 46%, body mass index [BMI]: 36.9 ± 7.6 kg/; BMI z-score 2.6 ± 0.4). Seventy-four (8.9%) children had TSH between 5 and <10 mIU/L (high TSH [HTSH]).

The increments in energy expenditure were similar by HULA and WALK. Body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and metabolic parameters were measured at baseline and after HULA and WALK. The primary endpoint was the change in fat % in the android region.A total of 53subjects (waist 92 ± 1 cm, body mass index 28 ± 1 kg/) completed the study. Body weight changed similarly (-0.6 ± 0.2 vs. -0.5 ± 0.2 kg, nonsignificant; HULA vs. WALK). During the intervention the subjects hula-hooped on average 12.8 ± 0.5 min/day and walked 9,986 ± 376 steps/day. The % fat in the android region decreased significantly by HULA but not by WALK (between-group change p < 0.001). Trunk muscle mass increased more by HULA than by WALK (p < 0.05). Waist circumference decreased more by HULA than by WALK (-3.1 ± 0.3 cm vs. -0.7 ± 0.4 cm, p < 0.001; HULA vs. WALK). WALK but not HULA significantly lowered systolic blood pressure and increased HDL cholesterol while HULA significantly decreased LDL cholesterol.Hula-hooping with a weighted hula-hoop can be used to decrease abdominal fat % and increase trunk muscle mass in overweight subjects. Its LDL lowering effect resembles that described for resistance training.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

Recent studies find that lncRNA long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 689 (LINC00689) is associated with  and participates in eukaryotic gene expression. However, whether LINC00689 plays a critical role in glioma progression remains unknown. Here, we identified a highly expressed lncRNA LINC00689 in gliomas compared to normal brain tissues based on the GSE dataset (GSE4290). The analysis of our data indicated that the expression of LINC00689 was up-regulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Moreover, the high expression of LINC00689 was closely correlated with tumor size ≥3 cm, high tumor grade, low KPS scores and poor prognosis of glioma patients. Further investigation demonstrated that LINC00689 knockdown markedly repressed the proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis of glioma cells. Additionally, silencing of LINC00689 significantly suppressed the growth of glioma cells in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC00689 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by directly interacting with miR-338-3p to promote pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) expression. Notably, we also revealed that restoration of PKM2 abolished the effects of LINC00689 silencing on glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis. In summary, our results suggested that LINC00689/miR-338-3p/PKM2 axis might play an essential role in glioma progression.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

Analysis of the effectiveness in terms of weight loss is fundamental to understand the real potential of digital technologies as tools for delivery of weight loss interventions. For this, we need accurate and reliable anthropometric data. For reasons of convenience, self-reported weight and height often replace actual measurements in these interventions. This might lead to misclassification of BMI status during selection of participants and to bias in the assessment of the outcomes. Therefore, it is fundamental to have validation studies of self-reported web-based data.We aimed to validate online self-reported height, weight and BMI in a POEmaS trial subsample.We included 12.5% of the POEmaS' population (n=159). Anthropometric data reported on the web-platform were compared to measured data by paired T-tests. Agreement was assessed by Bland-Altman plots. Multinomial regression was used to investigate factors associated with self-reported weight validity.There was no significant difference between reported and measured weight (0.4 kg, SD 1.7; p=0.13) and BMI (0.03 kg/, SD 0.87; p=0.06). Reported height was on average 0.4 cm (SD 1.2) higher than the measured ones (p<0.001). For all anthropometric data, >=95% of the cases were within the limits of agreement. Higher measured BMI was the only factor associated with low accuracy of weight report. Each unit increase in BMI increased the odds that the reported weight was lower than the one measured (OR 1.13; 95%CI 1.01-1.26).Self-reported weight and BMI change showed good agreement with measured ones. Since these are the primary outcomes of the POEmaS trial, the findings of the validation study suggest that the outcomes' accuracy is high and that it does not vary across gender, age, study group. These findings are relevant to digital health researchers and assessors and suggest that digital health interventions for weight loss might rely on self-reported assessment of outcomes. This might be particularly useful when other modes of assessment, such as anthropometry and e-scales, are not feasible or not available. However, we acknowledge that these results might not be applicable to low educated populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132105>True Interindividual Variability Exists in Postprandial Appetite Responses in Healthy Men But Is Not Moderated by the FTO Genotype.</a></h2><p>After meal ingestion, a series of coordinated hormone responses occur concomitantly with changes in perceived appetite. It is not known whether interindividual variability in appetite exists in response to a meal.The aim of this study was to 1) assess the reproducibility of appetite responses to a meal; 2) quantify individual differences in responses; and 3) explore any moderating influence of the fat mass and  associated (FTO) gene.Using a replicated crossover design, 18 healthy men (mean ± SD age: 28.5 ± 9.8 y; BMI: 27.0 ± 5.0 kg/) recruited according to FTO genotype (9 AA, 9 TT) completed 2 identical control and 2 identical standardized meal conditions (5025 kJ) in randomized sequences. Perceived appetite and plasma acylated ghrelin, total peptide YY (PYY), insulin, and glucose concentrations were measured before and after interventions as primary outcomes. Interindividual differences were explored using Pearson's product-moment correlations between the first and second replicates of the control-adjusted meal response. Within-participant covariate-adjusted linear mixed models were used to quantify participant-by-condition and genotype-by-condition interactions.The meal suppressed acylated ghrelin and appetite perceptions [standardized effect size (ES): 0.18-4.26] and elevated total PYY, insulin, and glucose (ES: 1.96-21.60). For all variables, SD of change scores was greater in the meal than in the control conditions. Moderate-to-large positive correlations were observed between the 2 replicates of control-adjusted meal responses for all variables (r = 0.44-0.86, P ≤ 0.070). Participant-by-condition interactions were present for all variables (P ≤ 0.056). FTO genotype-by-condition interactions were nonsignificant (P ≥ 0.19) and treatment effect differences between genotype groups were small (ES ≤ 0.27) for all appetite parameters.Reproducibility of postprandial appetite responses is generally good. True interindividual variability is present beyond any random within-subject variation in healthy men but we detected no moderation by the FTO genotype.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ESG in adults.We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library through July 2019. Investigated outcomes included the percent total body weight loss (TBWL), body mass index reduction, percent excess weight loss (EWL), and adverse events.We extracted data from 8 original studies, published from 2016 through 2019, which included a total of 1772 patients. At 6 months, mean TBWL was 15.1% (95% CI, 14.3-16.0), mean decrease in body mass index was 5.65 kg/ (95% CI, 5.07-6.22), and mean excess weight loss was 57.7% (95% CI, 52.0-63.4). Weight loss was sustained at 12 months and 18-24 months with a TBWL of 16.5% (95% CI, 15.2-17.8) and 17.2% (95% CI, 14.6-19.7), respectively. The pooled post-ESG rate of severe adverse events was 2.2% (95% CI, 1.6%-3.1%], including pain or nausea requiring hospitalization (n = 18, 1.08%), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (n=9, 0.56%), and peri-gastric leak or fluid collection (n = 8, 0.48%).In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found ESG to produce clinically significant weight loss that was reproducible among independent centers and to have a low rate of severe adverse events.

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is most commonly used to assess FM and FFM as it is simple and inexpensive. Variables from BIA measurements are used in predictive equations to estimate FM and FFM. To date, these equations have not been validated for use in adolescents with severe .In a cohort of adolescents with severe  (SO), a BMI ≥ 120% of the 95th percentile, this study aimed to 1) derive a BIA predictive equation data from air displacement plethysmography (ADP) measurements; 2) reassess the equation in a second validation cohort; and 3) compare the accuracy of existing body composition equations.Adolescents with SO were assessed using ADP and BIA. FM values derived from ADP measurements from the first cohort (n = 27) were used to develop a BIA predictive equation (i.e., Hamilton). A second cohort (n = 65) was used to cross-validate the new and 9 existing BIA predictive equations.Ninety-two adolescents (15.8 ± 1.9 y; BMI: 46.1 ± 9.9 kg/) participated. Compared with measured FFM using ADP: 1) the Lazzer, Hamilton, Gray, and Kyle equations were without significant bias; 2) the Hamilton and Gray equations had the smallest absolute and relative differences; 3) the Kyle and Gray equations showed the strongest correlation; 4) the Hamilton equation most accurately predicted FFM within ± 5% of measured FFM; and 5) 8 out of 9 equations had similar root mean squared prediction error values (6.03-6.64 kg).The Hamilton BIA equation developed in this study best predicted body composition values for groups of adolescents with severe  in a validation cohort.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622411>The FTO genetic variants are associated with dietary intake and body mass index amongst Emirati population.</a></h2><p>The risk of  is determined by complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Little research to date has investigated the interaction between gene and food intake. The aim of the current study is to explore the potential effect of fat mass and -associated protein gene (FTO) rs9939609 and rs9930506 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on the pattern of food intake in the Emirati population.Adult healthy Emirati subjects with Body mass index (BMI) of 16-40 kg/ were included in the study. Genotyping for FTO rs9939609(A>T) and rs9930506(A>G) was performed using DNA from saliva samples. Subjects were categorized according to the WHO classification by calculating the BMI to compare different classes. Dietary intake was assessed by a sixty-one-item FFQ that estimated food and beverage intakes over the past year. The daily energy, macronutrient, and micronutrient consumption were computed.We included 169 subjects in the final analysis (mean age 30.49± 9.1years, 57.4% females). The mean BMI of the study population was 26.19 kg/. Both SNPs were in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. The rs9939609 AA genotype was significantly associated with higher BMI (p = 0.004); the effect was significant in females (p = 0.028), but not in males (p = 0.184). Carbohydrate intake was significantly higher in AA subjects with a trend of lower fat intake compared to other genotypes. The odds ratio for the AA was 3.78 in the fourth quartile and 2.67 for the A/T in the second quartile of total carbohydrate intake, considering the first quartile as a reference (95% CI = 1.017-14.1 and 1.03-6.88, respectively).

This was a cross-sectional study in adult RTR (body mass index (BMI) ≥18.5kg/). Body composition was evaluated by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and anthropometry. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated (eGFR) by CKD-EPI equation. The prevalence of sarcopenia in adult RTR (n=185; 57% men, 50 years and eGFR 55.80±1.52ml/min.) was 7% (FNIH), 11% (EWGSOP2) and 17% (EWGSOP).

Given the established importance of self-monitoring for weight loss, the aims were to evaluate bidirectional associations between adherence to self-monitoring and weight change and to examine the moderating effect of treatment condition on these associations.Adults with overweight/ (n = 276; 83% women; 92.8% White; Mage = 55.1 years; Mbody mass index = 35.2 kg/) were instructed to self-monitor dietary intake, daily weight, and physical activity minutes via paper diaries in GROUP and CONTROL and via a smartphone application in SMART. All participants were weighed monthly at the research center. Adherence to self-monitoring was assessed via examination of self-monitoring records.Generalized linear mixed models revealed that adherence to self-monitoring of dietary intake, self-weighing, and physical activity for each month was associated with weight change throughout that month, such that increased frequency of self-monitoring led to greater weight loss (ps < .001). For the GROUP condition only, poorer weight losses in 1 month were prospectively associated with poor adherence to self-monitoring the following month (ps ≤ .01).Results provide evidence of a bidirectional association between self-monitoring and weight change. Better self-monitoring was consistently associated with better weight loss across intervention and tracking modalities. Poorer weight loss was prospectively associated with poorer self-monitoring in group treatment, suggesting that social influences could drive adherence in this form of treatment.

Among Asian Indians the only previous study has shown reduced FMD in brothers.This study was a tertiary care hospital-based cross-sectional case control study in the outpatient department of the endocrine clinic over 18 months. In total, 41 brothers and 35 sisters of women with PCOS (diagnosed by 2003 Rotterdam criteria) were recruited.Age (±2 years), sex and BMI- (±1 kg/) matched controls were selected. Cases and controls underwent clinical and biochemical investigations. Cardiologists performed doppler ultrasonogram to determine CIMT and FMD in a blinded fashion.FMD was decreased in brothers [median 12.3% interquartile range (5.1, 19) versus 18.4% (12.6, 21.5), P = 0.002] and in sisters [10.8% (5.8, 17.2) versus 14.7% (11.4, 18.2), P = 0.027] when compared to controls.

Metabolic syndrome was more common in brothers (27% versus 5% in controls, P = 0.007) even after matching for age and BMI. Insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance and acanthosis) was higher in brothers as compared to controls. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate was significantly elevated in brothers.There may have been referral bias of patients with PCOS in a tertiary care institute, and the radiological assessment was performed by two cardiologists serially on different time frames over the study duration. Power was only 50% in CIMT for brothers.Siblings of women with PCOS had higher CVD risk over and above the already pre-existing higher metabolic risk associated with Asian Indian ethnicity and therefore the siblings require vigilant management.

The objective was to verify the effectiveness of a combined school and home-based  prevention program on excessive weight gain in adolescents. Teachers delivered the school-based primary prevention program to fifth and sixth graders (9 schools, 48 control classes, 49 intervention classes), which included encouraging healthy eating habits and physical activity. A subgroup of overweight or obese adolescents also received a home-based secondary prevention program delivered by community health professionals. Schools were randomized to intervention or control group. Intent-to-treat analysis used mixed models for repeated continuous measures and considered the cluster effect. The main outcomes were changes in body mass index (BMI) and percent body fat (%body fat) after one school-year of intervention and follow-up. Against our hypothesis, BMI increased more in the intervention group than in the control group (Δ=0.3kg/; p=0.05) with a greater decrease in %body fat among boys (Δ=-0.6%; p=0.03) in the control group. The intervention group increased physical activity by 12.5 minutes per week compared with the control group. Female adolescents in the intervention group ate healthier items more frequently than in the control group. The subgroup who received both the school and home interventions had an increase in %body fat than in the control group (Δ=0.89%; p=0.01). In this study, a behavioral change led to a small increased in physical activity and healthy eating habits but also to an overall increase in food intake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31398219>Do the body mass index and the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus influence the level of physical activity during pregnancy and postpartum?</a></h2><p> and lack of physical exercise are associated with the increase of diabetes mellitus in women of reproductive age and during the gestational period. The objective of the present study was to evaluate physical activity levels during the pregnancy and postpartum periods and the influence of body mass index (BMI) in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or low risk pregnancy. The Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ), translated and validated for Portuguese, was used for the evaluation of physical activity (PA) level. The sample was stratified according to preconception BMI and the presence or absence of diagnosis of GDM, resulting in four groups with 66 participants each: low risk pregnancy (LRP) with normal weight (BMI ≥ 18.5 and ≤ 24 kg/), LRP and overweight/obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/), GDM with normal weight and GDM with overweight/obese. The level of PA of each participant was measured as Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) during the preconceptional period (T0), in the third trimester of gestation (T1), and three months after delivery (T2). The comparison of the MET values showed that the values found in the evaluation three months after delivery (T2) were higher than 1.00 (1.10 MET for the LRP-normal weight, 1.06 MET for LRP-overweight/obese, 1.02 MET for the GDM- normal weight, 1.07 MET for the GDM-overweight/obese). On the pre-gestational (T0) and third trimester (T1) analyzes, the values were less than 1.00 MET. The analysis between groups in relation to BMI and diagnosis of GDM showed no difference.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31321930>Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Bronchial Asthma Patients: Assessment of Prevalence and Risk Factors.</a></h2><p>Sleep-related breathing disorders are group of respiratory disease among them obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent and seen among those having recognized risk factors. Recent studies have shown that asthma and OSA contribute bi directional relationship where each disorder adversely influences the other one. This study was planned to assess OSA among bronchial sthma patients.This study was conducted at Sleep lab of our department among adult patients of bronchial asthma after institutional ethical committee approval. Eligible and willing to participate patients were subjected to clinical assessment protocol that included history, clinical examination, measurement of Sleep Score, BMI, neck circumference etc followed by overnight Level 1 polysomnography.50 patients with age range 30 to 68 years constituted the study population with mean age of 48.16 years. 70% patients were female with male female ratio of 1:2.3. The prevalence of OSA in asthma patients was 46%. 12% patients had mild OSA, 14% had moderate while 20% were having severe OSA. Mean BMI in our study was 27.87 Kg/ . OSA patients were associated with more BMI compared to patients without OSA (42% vs. 30%) (p value 0.04). Asthma patients who were smokers had more OSA symptoms compared to non-smokers (p value 0.002). Asthma patients with OSA were also associated with higher neck circumference and more snoring at night time as compared to non OSA population. Uncontrolled asthma was seen in 18 patients and 16 of them were having OSA (p=0.001). Most common co morbid illness in patients with OSA was GERD (78.26%) followed by allergic rhinitis (56%). Most of these patients (82%) were not having associated major local anatomical defect.:OSA is not uncommon in asthma patients. Careful assessment of sleep related symptoms and demographic parameters of asthma patients are essential to suspect diagnosis of OSA. Additional factors like smoking, , GERD and allergic rhinitis are important contributing factor for higher risk of OSA among asthma patients. Early diagnosis of OSA in asthma patients by polysomnography may have a clinical benefit in the management of both diseases.© Journal of the Association of Physicians of India 2011.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493329>Effects of Left Gastric Artery Ligation Versus Sleeve Gastrectomy on -Induced Adipose Tissue Macrophage Infiltration and Inflammation in Diet-Induced Obese Rats.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND Bariatric procedures such as left gastric artery ligation (LGAL) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) have emerged as important procedures for treating morbid . In this study, we compared the effects of LGAL vs. SG on -induced adipose tissue macrophage infiltration and inflammation in diet-induced obese rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks to induce . SG, GLAL, or corresponding sham surgeries were performed in anesthetized rats. Inflammatory factor expression in serum and epididymal and retroperitoneal adipose tissues were analyzed 4 weeks after surgery. Macrophage infiltration and phenotype transformation were also assessed with Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. RESULTS Both LGAL and SG strongly attenuated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced fat accumulation in retroperitoneal and epididymal tissues. The expressions of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 were downregulated after LGAL and after SG by promoting activation of  macrophages, despite continued exposure to HFD. Furthermore, both LGAL and SG resulted in increased macrophage infiltration, but did not contribute to phenotype transformation of macrophages to M1. CONCLUSIONS LGAL and SG both reduced fat accumulation caused by HFD feeding. Therapies designed to ameliorate the inflammatory response by promoting activation of  macrophages may be valuable.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31344165>[Maximum aerobic power output in overweight and obese individuals].</a></h2><p>The evaluation of physical fitness is important to determine workloads and to assess the effectiveness of exercise interventions in obese people.To determine the maximum aerobic power output (MAPO) in overweight and obese individuals and to establish reference parameters for the Chilean population.One hundred five men and 218 women performed a cycle ergometer test up to 85% of their maximum heart rate. MAPO was determined by linear extrapolation of the theoretical maximum heart rate.Among men, MAPO values were 234.9 ± 48.4 w for body mass index (BMI) values between 30 and 34.9 kg/, 235.1 ± 69.7 w for BMI between 35 and 39.9 kg/, 270.2 ± 86.5 w for BMI over 40 kg/. MAPO relative values were 2.27 ± 0.5, 2.16 ± 0.6 and 1.96 ± 0.8 w/kg, respectively. Among women, MAPO was 172.6 ± 36.1 w for a BMI < 30 kg/, 169.2 ± 39.4 w for BMI between 30 and 34.9 kg/, 179.5 ± 48.8 w f179.5 ± 48.8 w for BMI between 35 and 39.9 kg/ and 202.3 ± 57.3 w for BMI of 40 kg/ or over. The relative values were 2.33 ± 0.5; 2.02 ± 0.5; 1.91 ± 0.5 and 1.81 ± 0.5 w / kg (p < 0.05).MAPO estimation with a cycle ergometer test is well tolerated in overweight and obese individuals. MAPO decreased along with BMI increments in women. No association between BMI and MAPO in men was observed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31338737>Cost-Utility of Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in Chinese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and  with a BMI ≥ 27.5 kg/: a Multi-Center Study with a 4-Year Follow-Up of Surgical Cohort.</a></h2><p>To find whether Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery was cost effective compared to conventional medical management (CMM) in Chinese patients with type 2 Diabetes(T2D) and  with a body mass index (BMI) ≥27.5 kg/m in four years.A total of 106 obese T2D individuals who underwent RYGB and 106 T2D patients treated with CMM were enrolled from three academic medical centers. Total health related costs, Glycated Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) and BMI was recorded. Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA) was used. Utility values according to results of A1c were obtained from published studies.Improvements were observed in A1C (8.6% at baseline to 6.2% in the first year, p < 0.001) and BMI (30.7 kg/m at baseline to 24.3 kg/m in the first year, p < 0.001), and the effect lasted for 4 years after RYGB. In the CMM group, A1C fluctuated in four years. The health utility for RYGB group scores 3.756, whereas CMM group scores 3.594 in four years. The total healthcare costs decreased sharply from the second year after RYGB ($8,483 [¥52,596] in the first year to $672[¥4,164] in the second year, p < 0.001) and maintained for 3 years. In the CMM group, the total healthcare costs changed without significance. RYGB costs US$19,359 (¥125,836) per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained (incremental cost-utility ratio [ICUR]) compared to CMM, which was lower than a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $20,277/QALY.Compared to CMM, RYGB is cost-effective for Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes and  4 years after operation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216384>Autologous transplantation of photoactivated subcutaneous adipose tissue improves glucose homeostasis in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence indicates that normal adipose tissue transplantation improves whole-body energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model. Adipose tissue macrophages are associated with glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes and  in humans, offering a potential target for therapeutics. However, whether transplantation of autologous adipose tissue that changes the macrophage phenotype directly contributes to systemic glucose intolerance has not been determined. We specifically developed our device, with more refined wavelengths of light to activate the macrophage phenotype in isolated subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) from host HFD mice. Autologous transplantation of photoactivated sWAT into HFD mice significantly reverses the M1 macrophage phenotype into , reduces the infiltration of macrophages in adipose tissues of HFD mice, and decreases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Strikingly, this transplantation reduced blood glucose levels and caused significant improvement in glucose tolerance, which was not shown in sham-operated or nonphotoactivated sWAT-transplanted HFD mice. Moreover, positron emission/computed tomography scans indicated higher glucose uptake in the heart but not in the liver, hindlimb muscles, or abdominal sWAT. These data suggested that the ability of photoactivation to shift Adipose tissue macrophage polarization in HFD mice caused a significant improvement in glucose homeostasis and that autologous transplantation might be a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of diabetes.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337202>Comparison of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption of different exercises in normal weight  women.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to compare the excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) between different types of exercises in women with normal weight  (NWO).Nine university students with NWO having body mass index <25 kg/ and body fat percentage >30% participated in the study. First, continuous exercise (CEx) on an ergometer for 30 minutes at 60% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and interval exercise (IEx) at 80% VO2max for 2 minutes were performed. This was followed by exercise performed at 40% VO2max for 1 minute and at 80% VO2max for 3 minutes, performed 6 times repeatedly for a total of 26 minutes. The accumulation of short duration exercise (AEx) was performed for 3-bouts of 10 minutes each at 60% VO2max.The major findings were as follows: energy consumption during the exercises showed no significant difference between CEx, IEx, and AEx; EPOC was higher in IEx and AEx as compared to CEx for all dependent variables (e.g. total oxygen consumption, total calorie, summation of heart rate, and EPOC duration); and the lipid profile showed no significant difference.Our study confirmed that when homogenizing the energy expenditure for various exercises in NWO individuals, EPOC was higher in IEx and AEx than in CEx. Therefore, IEx and AEx can be considered as effective exercise methods for increasing energy expenditure in NWO females.©2019 The Korean Society for Exercise Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554529>Critical Care Management of Status Epilepticus at a Tertiary Care University Hospital.</a></h2><p>Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurological emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to review the critical care management of patients with SE focusing on antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) as well as to determine the optimal dosing strategies of phenytoin (PHT) and predictors of its effectiveness.A retrospective chart review of adult patients with SE admitted to the University of Alberta Hospital, Canada, was conducted.Fifty-six admissions were included. Benzodiazepines (BDZs) were initially given in 89% of our patients. Following BDZs, PHT and levetiracetam were the most commonly initiated AEDs as first- and second-line agents and were deemed effective in 30/44 and 5/11 patients, respectively. Patients who received a PHT loading dose (LD) of 1000 mg were less likely to reach target levels compared with a weight-based LD ≥15 mg/kg (29% vs. 60%). Likewise, patients who received a maintenance dose (MD) of 300 mg/day were less likely to reach target compared with 400 mg/day or >5 mg/kg per day; however, this did not reach statistical significance. Three variables were found to be associated with PHT effectiveness: tonic-clonic SE (OR 5.01, 95% CI 1.02-24.7, p = 0.048), history of seizures and BMI <30 kg/ (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.03-1.07, p = 0.059).Further studies of the predictors of PHT effectiveness, specifically , are necessary to help individualize care. Finally, we suggest that PHT should be loaded according to the guidelines as 20 mg/kg followed by an MD of at least 400 mg/day or >5 mg/kg per day.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504108>A Bayesian Sensitivity Analysis to Partition BMI Into Components of Body Composition: An Application to Head and Neck Cancer Survival.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have suggested a "J-shaped" relationship between body mass index (BMI, kg/) and survival among head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. However, BMI is a vague measure of body composition. To provide greater resolution we used Bayesian sensitivity analysis, informed by external data, to model the relationship between predicted fat mass index (FMI, kg adipose tissue/), lean mass index (LMI, kg lean tissue/) and survival. We estimated posterior median hazard ratios (HR) and 95% credible intervals for the BMI-mortality relationship in a Bayesian framework using data from 1,180 adults in North Carolina with HNC diagnosed between 2002 and 2006. Risk factors were assessed by interview shortly after diagnosis and vital status through 2013 via the National Death Index. The relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality was convex with a nadir at 28.6 with greater risk observed throughout the normal weight range. The sensitivity analysis indicated that this was consistent with opposing increases in risk with FMI (1 kg/ increase, HR = 1.04 [1.00, 1.08]) and decreases with LMI (1 kg/ increase, HR = 0.90 [0.85, 0.95]). Patterns were similar for HNC-specific mortality but associations were stronger. Measures of body composition, rather than BMI, should be considered in relation to mortality risk.© The Author(s) 2019.
