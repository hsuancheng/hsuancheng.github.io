<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686182>From the prion-like propagation hypothesis to therapeutic strategies of anti-tau .</a></h2><p>The term "propagon" is used to define proteins that may transmit misfolding in vitro, in tissues or in organisms. Among propagons, misfolded tau is thought to be involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of various "tauopathies" that include Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and argyrophilic grain disease. Here, we review the available data in the literature and point out how the prion-like tau propagation has been extended from Alzheimer's disease to tauopathies. First, in Alzheimer's disease, the progression of tau aggregation follows stereotypical anatomical stages which may be considered as spreading. The mechanisms of the propagation are now subject to intensive and controversial research. It has been shown that tau may be secreted in the interstitial fluid in an active manner as reflected by high and constant concentration of extracellular tau during Alzheimer's pathology. Animal and cell models have been devised to mimic tau seeding and propagation, and despite their limitations, they have further supported to the prion-like propagation hypothesis. Finally, such new ways of thinking have led to different therapeutic strategies in anti-tau  among tauopathies and have stimulated new clinical trials. However, it appears that the prion-like propagation hypothesis mainly relies on data obtained in Alzheimer's disease. From this review, it appears that further studies are needed (1) to characterize extracellular tau species, (2) to find the right pathological tau species to target, (3) to follow in vivo tau pathology by brain imaging and biomarkers and (4) to interpret current clinical trial results aimed at reducing the progression of these pathologies. Such inputs will be essential to have a comprehensive view of these promising therapeutic strategies in tauopathies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681606>The Controversial Role of PD-1 and Its Ligands in Gynecological Malignancies.</a></h2><p>The programmed death-1 (PD-1, CD279) receptor with its ligands, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1, CD274, B7-H1), and programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2, CD273, B7-DC), are the key players of one of the immune checkpoint pathways inhibiting T-cell activation. PD-L1 and PD-L2 are expressed in different cancer cells and their microenvironment, including infiltrating immune cells. However, their prognostic value is still debated and their role in the tumor microenvironment has not been fully elucidated yet. Considering the importance that cancer  with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies gained in several tumor types, in this review article we aim to discuss the role of the PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 axis in gynecological cancers. PD-1 ligands have been detected in ovarian, cervical, vulvar and uterine cancers, and correlation with prognosis seems dependent from their distribution. About PD-L2, very few reports are available so far in gynecological malignancies, and its role is still not completely understood. Clinical trials using anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies, but not anti-PD-L2, are currently ongoing, in all types of gynecological cancers. They have shown good safety profiles in a certain cohort of patients, but response rates remain low and many aspects remain controversial. In this review, we propose possible solutions to enhance the clinical efficacy of PD-1 axis targeting therapies. Regarding PD-L2, it might be useful to better clarify its role in order to improve the efficiency of  in female malignancies.Copyright © 2019 Marinelli, Annibali, Aguzzi, Tuyaerts, Amant, Morelli, Santoni, Amantini, Maggi and Nabissi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679220>The Importance of Cancer Stem Cells in Gastrointestinal Cancers.</a></h2><p>Cancer is a major cause of death worldwide. Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are still an important cause of tumor-related deaths. Conventional therapeutic approaches like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy are indispensable but insufficient. Despite the advances in  and other conventional treatment strategies, some might argue that we are still far from curing cancer. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) might be to blame. Because sequencing technologies are moving fast in this precision-medicine era, molecular testing of tumors, circulating tumor cells, and CSCs have important implications for treatment decisions. Biomarkers offer prognostic values and targeted therapy availabilities as molecular predictive factors. CSCs are considered biomarkers of tumorigenesis development, metastasis, and recurrence. In this review, we summarize the important issues over CSCs and the development of new drugs that target GI CSCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680691>Anti-regulatory T cells are natural regulatory effector T cells.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692518>Recent advances and application of PD-1 blockade in sarcoma.</a></h2><p>The role of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) signaling pathway in tumor  is becoming increasingly important, and several PD-1-blocking agents have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. PD-1-blocking therapy alone or in combination with other therapeutic modalities has become a standard treatment for several kinds of solid tumors. However, sarcomas are not indications for anti-PD-1 therapy. Sarcomas are a group of heterogeneous diseases that can currently only be cured by surgery at the early stage. No effective treatments exist for sarcoma patients in advanced stages. Owning to the diversity of sarcomas, it is very difficult to conduct randomized controlled clinical studies on specific subtypes of sarcomas. Although clinical studies of sarcomas continue, few breakthroughs in the treatment of sarcomas have been achieved over the past decades. This review summarizes recent progress in anti-PD-1 therapy for sarcomas. Based on the published data, PD-1 blockade may be more effective in combination with other modalities for the treatment of sarcomas. In addition, biomarkers may be used to ascertain sensitivity to PD-1 blockade in sarcoma patients.© 2019 Zuo and Zhao.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684193>Cooperative and Escaping Mechanisms between Circulating Tumor Cells and Blood Constituents.</a></h2><p>Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths and despite measurable progress in the field, underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) disseminate within the bloodstream, where most of them die due to the attack of the immune system. On the other hand, recent evidence shows active interactions between CTCs and platelets, myeloid cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and other hematopoietic cells that secrete immunosuppressive cytokines, which aid CTCs to evade the immune system and enable metastasis. Platelets, for instance, regulate inflammation, recruit neutrophils, and cause fibrin clots, which may protect CTCs from the attack of Natural Killer cells or macrophages and facilitate extravasation. Recently, a correlation between the commensal microbiota and the inflammatory/immune tone of the organism has been stablished. Thus, the microbiota may affect the development of cancer-promoting conditions. Furthermore, CTCs may suffer phenotypic changes, as those caused by the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, that also contribute to the immune escape and resistance to . In this review, we discuss the findings regarding the collaborative biological events among CTCs, immune cells, and microbiome associated to immune escape and metastatic progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681766>Doxycycline Inducible Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells Targeting CD147 for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Therapy.</a></h2><p>Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy to hematological malignancies has demonstrated tremendous clinical outcomes. However, the therapeutic efficacy of CAR-T cells in solid tumors remains limited due to the scarcity of tumor-specific antigen targets and the poor infiltration of CAR-T cells into tumor tissue. In this study, we developed a novel inducible CAR-T cell system which targets CD147, a tumor-associated antigen for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To minimize potential toxicities of CAR-T cell therapy, the Tet-On 3G system was introduced to induce CD147CAR expression in the right place at the right time. Specifically, Tet-CD147CAR lentiviral vector (LV-Tet-CD147CAR) was constructed, which comprised CD147CAR controlled by the Tet-On system. Tet-CD147CART cells were successfully generated from activated T cells by infection with LV-Tet-CD147CAR. Proliferation, cytotoxicity, and cytokine secretion of Tet-CD147CART cells were significantly increased against CD147-positive cancer cells in the presence of doxycycline (Dox) compared to Tet-CD147CART cells in the absence of Dox and PBMCs. Consistently,  studies indicated that the tumor growth in nude mice was significantly inhibited by (Dox+) Tet-CD147CART cells through multiple intratumoral administration. Taken together, our results indicated that the expression and activity of CD147CAR were controlled by Dox both  and , which facilitated decreased toxicity and adverse effects to CAR-T cell therapy. Moreover, this study provides viable evidence in support of the potential benefits and translation of this strategy of CAR-T cells targeting CD147 for the treatment of patients with HCC.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Wei, Liu, Yong, Wei, Zhang, Lv, Zhang, Chen and Bian.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692041>Combination of attenuated Salmonella carrying PD-1 siRNA with nifuroxazide for colon cancer therapy.</a></h2><p>Colon cancer is a member of malignant tumors in the digestive system. Traditional treatment strategies are ineffective and improving the treatment of colon cancer is an urgent need. Targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) by monoclonal antibodies has shown some therapeutic effectiveness and has advantages. Additionally, the Stat3 inhibitor nifuroxazide was employed to promote the antitumor activity. Here, we hypothesized that combining nifuroxazide with PD-1 small interfering RNA carried by attenuated Salmonella would exert a synergistic antitumor effect on colon cancer. Indeed, treatment with this combination effectively inhibited the development of colon cancer in mice and improved the survival rate. These two novel anticancer agents worked synergistically to elicit potent antitumor immunity and achieve improved therapeutic efficacy. The underlying mechanisms are mainly involved with immune regulation and cell apoptosis. This study provides a previous framework for combining this Stat3 inhibitor with RNAi designed to block immune checkpoint signaling for cancer therapy.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683170>Potential role of microbiome in oncogenesis, outcome prediction and therapeutic targeting for head and neck cancer.</a></h2><p>In the last decade, human microbiome research is rapidly growing involving several fields of clinical medicine and population health. Although the microbiome seems to be linked to all sorts of diseases, cancer has the biggest potential to be investigated. Following the publication of the National Institute of Health - Human Microbiome Project (NIH-HMP), the link between Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) and microbiome seems to be a fast-moving field in research area. However, robust evidence-based literature is still quite scarce. Nevertheless the relationship between oral microbiome and HNC could have important consequences for prevention and early detection of this type of tumors. The aims of the present review are: (i) to discuss current pre-clinical evidence of a role of oral microbiome in HNC; (ii) to report recent developments in understanding the human microbiome's relationship with HNC oncogenesis; (iii) to explore the issue of treatment response and treatment toxicity; (iv) to describe the role of microbiota as potentially modifiable factor suitable for targeting by therapeutics. Further studies are needed to better establish the causal relationship between oral microbiome and HNC oncogenesis. Future trials should continue to explore oral microbiome in order to build the scientific and clinical rationale of HNC preventative and ameliorate treatment outcome.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report a single center experience encountered in 18 patients with refractory solid malignancies treated with adoptive cellular  (ACI) from haploidentical or matched donors following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. While seven patients were in partial and six in complete remission (CR), five patients suffered from relapsed diseases at the time of ACI. 1.5-year probabilities of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 19.5% and 16.1% for all patients. Patients in CR showed estimated 1.5-year OS and PFS of 50.1% and 42.7%, respectively. CR was induced or rather sustained in ten children, with two still being alive 9.6 and 9.3 years after ACI. Naïve, central and effector memory T-cells correlated with responses. However, the majority of patients relapsed. Cumulative incidence of relapse was 79.8% at 1.5 years. Acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) occurred in nine of 18 patients (50%) with aGVHD grade I-II observed in six (33%) and aGVHD grade III seen in three (17%) patients, manageable in all cases. Altogether, study results indicate that donor-derived ACI at its current state offers palliation but no clear curative benefit for refractory childhood cancers and warrants further improvement.Copyright: © 2019 Merker et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681571>Multi-omics Analysis of Microenvironment Characteristics and Immune Escape Mechanisms of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>The immune environment in primary tumor has a profound impact on . However, the clinical relevance of immune environment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is largely unknown. Here, the immune profile and its clinical response in HCC were investigated. The gene expression profiles of 569 HCCs from three cohorts (The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA,  = 257; Gene Expression Omnibus, GEO,  = 170; International Cancer Genome Consortium, ICGC,  = 142) were used in the current study. Five gene expression subtypes (C1-C5) responsible for global immune genes were identified in HCCs at stage I/II. It was found that subtype C4 was associated with upregulation and subtype C5 was associated with downregulation of immune profiles in most metagenes. Immune-correlation analysis of the five subtypes demonstrated that C3 and C4 had higher immune score and better prognostic outcome, as compared with other subtypes. Moreover, the mutation frequencies of TP53, CTNNB1, and AXIN1 had significant difference in the five subgroups. Further, the expression of PDCD1, CD274, PDCD1LG2, CTLA4, CD86, and CD80 was higher in subtype C4 in comparison with the other subtypes. The WGCNA of immune-related genes in the five subtypes revealed that blue and turquoise modules were positively correlated with subtype C4 and were associated with 12 common pathways in the KEGG database. These results were validated in external cohorts from the NCI (National Cancer Institute) cohort (GSE14520) and the ICGC (International Cancer Genome Consortium) cohort. In summary, one immune-enhanced subtype and one immune-decreased subtype having different immune and clinical characteristics may provide guidance for developing novel treatment strategies for immune system malfunction-related cancer.Copyright © 2019 Li, Wang, Ma, Zhang, Ou-yang, Qi and Liu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689930>Gemcitabine Combination Nano Therapies for Pancreatic Cancer.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest causes of cancer-related death in the United States, with a 5-year overall survival rate of 6 to 8%. These statistics suggest that immediate medical attention is needed. Gemcitabine (GEM) is the gold standard first-line single chemotherapy agent for pancreatic cancer but, after a few months, cells develop chemoresistance. Multiple clinical and experimental investigations have demonstrated that a combination or co-administration of other drugs as chemotherapies with GEM lead to superior therapeutic benefits. However, such combination therapies often induce severe systemic toxicities. Thus, developing strategies to deliver a combination of chemotherapeutic agents more securely to patients is needed. Nanoparticle-mediated delivery can offer to load a cocktail of drugs, increase stability and availability, on-demand and tumor-specific delivery while minimizing chemotherapy-associated adverse effects. This review discusses the available drugs being co-administered with GEM and the limitations associated during the process of co-administration. This review also helps in providing knowledge of the significant number of delivery platforms being used to overcome problems related to gemcitabine-based co-delivery of other chemotherapeutic drugs, thereby focusing on how nanocarriers have been fabricated, considering the modes of action, targeting receptors, pharmacology of chemo drugs incorporated with GEM, and the differences in the physiological environment where the targeting is to be done.

The development of immunotherapies has improved the survival of patients with HNSCC, but, the long-term prognosis of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC remains poor. HNSCC is characterized by intratumoral infiltration of regulatory T cells, dysfunctional natural killer cells, an elevated Treg/CD8 T cell ratio, and increased programmed cell death ligand 1 protein on tumor cells. This leads to an immunocompromised niche in favor of the proliferation and treatment resistance of cancer cells. To achieve an improved treatment response, several potential combination strategies, such as increasing the neoantigens for antigen presentation and therapeutic agents targeting components of the tumor microenvironment, have been explored and have shown promising results in preclinical studies. In addition, large-scale bioinformatic studies have also identified possible predictive biomarkers of HNSCC. As  has shown survival benefits in recent HNSCC clinical trials, a comprehensive investigation of immune cells and immune-related factors/cytokines and the immune profiling of tumor cells during the development of HNSCC may provide more insights into the complex immune microenvironment and thus, facilitate the development of novel immunotherapeutic agents.Copyright © 2019 Wang, Chan and Cho.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676264>Immune Networks and Therapeutic Targeting of iNKT Cells in Cancer.</a></h2><p>One of the primary goals in tumor  is to reset the immune system from tolerogenic to immunogenic - a process in which invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are implicated. iNKT cells develop in the thymus and perform immunosurveillance against tumor cells peripherally.

These humanized monoclonal antibodies against various immune checkpoints (receptors and ligands) effectively treat a number of malignancies by unleashing the immune system to destroy cancer cells. These drugs are not excreted by the kidneys or liver, have a long half-life, and undergo receptor-mediated clearance. Although these agents have greatly improved the prognosis of many cancers, immune-related end organ injury is a complication that has come to light in clinical practice. Although less common than other organ involvement, kidney lesions resulting in acute kidney injury and/or proteinuria are being described. Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis is the most common lesion seen on kidney biopsy, while acute tubular injury and glomerular lesions occur less commonly. Clinical findings and laboratory tests are suboptimal in predicting the underlying renal lesion, making kidney biopsy necessary in the majority of cases to definitely diagnose the lesion and potentially guide therapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitor discontinuation and corticosteroid therapy are recommended for acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. Based on a handful of cases, re-exposure to these drugs in patients who previously developed acute tubulointerstitial nephritis has been mixed. Although it is unclear whether re-exposure is appropriate, it should perhaps be considered in patients with limited options. When this approach is taken, patients should be closely monitored for recurrence of acute kidney injury. Treatment of cancer in patients with a kidney transplant with immune checkpoint inhibitors risks the development of acute rejection in some patients and requires close surveillance.Copyright © 2019 International Society of Nephrology.

Recently, numerous broadly neutralizing HIV-1 monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) have been developed which possess the characteristics necessary for potential prophylactic or therapeutic approaches. However, formulation complexities especially for multi-antibody deliveries, long infusion times, and production issues could limit the use of these bNAbs when deployed globally impacting their potential application. Here, we describe an approach utilizing synthetic DNA-encoded monoclonal antibodies (dMAbs) for direct in vivo production of prespecified neutralizing activity. We designed 16 different bNAbs as dMAbs cassettes and studied their activity in small and large animals. Sera from animals administered dMAbs neutralized multiple HIV-1 isolates with similar activity to their parental recombinant MAbs. Delivery of multiple dMAbs to a single animal led to increased neutralization breadth. Two dMAbs, PGDM1400 and PGT121, were advanced into non-human primates for study. High peak circulating levels (between 6-34µg/ml) of these dMAbs were measured and the sera of all animals displayed broad neutralizing activity.

Irreversible electroporation (IRE), a nonthermal ablative technique, may prolong survival of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Purpose To investigate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous IRE for locally advanced pancreatic cancer and locally recurring pancreatic cancer in a prospective phase II trial. Materials and Methods Between December 2012 and September 2017, participants with locally advanced pancreatic cancer or postresection local recurrence were prospectively treated with percutaneous CT-guided IRE ( identifier: ). The primary end point was median OS from diagnosis. The target median OS was 11.6 months for participants receiving no induction chemotherapy or gemcitabine-based induction chemotherapy and 14.9 months for those receiving induction 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX). Results Fifty participants (25 men and 25 women; median age, 61 years [interquartile range, 56-69 years]; 40 with locally advanced pancreatic cancer and 10 with local recurrence) were included. Median OS measured by using the Kaplan-Meier method was 17 months from diagnosis of locally advanced pancreatic cancer (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15 months, 19 months) and 10 months from IRE (95% CI: 8 months, 11 months). In the locally advanced pancreatic cancer group, 18 participants received no therapy or gemcitabine-based induction chemotherapy and 22 received FOLFIRINOX. The median OS from diagnosis was 17 months for both groups (95% CI: 7 months, 28 months and 15 months, 18 months, respectively;  = .26). For participants with postresection local recurrence, the median OS was 16 months from diagnosis of recurrence (95% CI: 11 months, 22 months) and 9 months from IRE (95% CI: 2 months, 16 months). After IRE, local recurrence developed in 23 of the 50 participants (46%). Tumor volume of 37 cm or greater (hazard ratio [HR], 2.9;  = .02), pre-IRE carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) level of 2000 U/mL or greater (HR, 12.1;  = .001), and decrease in CA 19-9 level of 50% or less 3 months after IRE (HR, 3.1;  = .01) were predictors of worse survival. Fourteen minor and 21 major complications occurred in 29 of the 50 participants (58%). Two participants died less than 90 days after IRE; one of these deaths was likely related to IRE. Conclusion The target median overall survival with CT-guided percutaneous irreversible electroporation was exceeded in participants with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (17 months) and those with local recurrence (16 months).© RSNA, 2019 See also the editorial by Goldberg in this issue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696344>Fairly rare small-diameter hepatocellular carcinoma with right adrenal gland metastasis having an inferior vena cava tumor thrombus: a case report.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may lead to extrahepatic metastasis (EHM). Most patients with EHM had either intrahepatic stage III or IVA tumor at the site of metastases. Herein, we present the case of a fairly rare 1.5-cm small-diameter HCC with right adrenal gland tumor having an inferior vena cava (IVC) tumor thrombus.A 75-year-old man had a 1.5-cm hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in segment 8 of the liver and a 3.0-cm right adrenal gland tumor with inferior vena cava (IVC) tumor thrombus. He underwent partial hepatectomy, right adrenalectomy, and IVC tumor thrombectomy. Tumor resection was successful, but the tumor progressed rapidly, and the patient died 8 months after the operation. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that both HCC cells and adrenal tumor cells were positive for HCC markers Glypican-3 and alpha-fetoprotein. In terms of adrenal carcinoma markers vimentin and Melan-A, vimentin was negative in the HCC and adrenal tumor, and Melan-A was negative in the HCC. In adrenal tumor, slight positivity of Melan-A was observed, but the intensity of staining was clearly weak compared with that in normal adrenal glands. CD133, one of the stem cell markers, was positive in both HCC and adrenal tumor cells. Next-generation amplicon sequencing analyses were performed using DNA derived from the HCC, adrenal tumor, and normal liver tissue. After exome data analyses for representative HCC-related genes as TERT, CTNNB1, TP53, and ARID2, TP53 mutation (exon3: c.G351 T: p.R117S) was found in both HCC cells and adrenal tumor cells. Conversely, no significant mutations in other genes were observed. These pathological findings and sequencing results showed that the adrenal tumor might be an adrenal metastasis of HCC in spite of small primary tumor size.This case suggests that the right adrenal tumor was a metastasis of HCC. Immunohistochemical staining and gene mutation analyses using NGS are very useful in differentiating the tumor origin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682447>Biodegradable Mesoporous Silica Achieved via Carbon Nanodots-Incorporated Framework Swelling for Debris-mediated Photothermal Synergistic .</a></h2><p>Incorporating carbon nanodots (CD) into mesoporous silica framework for extensive biomedicine, especially for the desirable cancer , is considered to be an unexplored challenge. Herein, a hydrogen bond/electrostatic-assisted co-assembly strategy was smartly exploited to uniformly incorporate polymer-coated CD into ordered mesoporous silica framework (CD@MSN). The obtained CD@MSN were not only biodegradable via the framework-incorporated CD-induced swelling, but also capable of gathering dispersive CD with enhanced photothermal effect and elevated targeting accumulation, which therefore can achieve photothermal imaging-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) in vitro and in vivo. Much interestingly, benefiting from the biodegraded debris, it was found that CD@MSN-mediated PTT can synergistically achieve immune-mediated inhibition of tumor metastasis via stimulating the proliferation and activation of NK cells and macrophages, and simultaneously up-regulating the secretion of corresponding cytokines (IFN-γ and Granzyme B).

Its advantages over DNA transfection make it attractive in applications where transient expression is desired. However, this has proved challenging due to mRNA's instability and susceptibility to degradation. Selenium is important for immune function and modulation, with selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) finding a niche in biomedicine as drug delivery vehicles, owing to their biocompatibility, low toxicity, and biodegradability. In this investigation, we synthesized chitosan-coated SeNPs with a folic acid targeting moiety for F mRNA delivery to cancer cells in vitro. Synthesized SeNPs were stable and well dispersed, and ranged from 59 to 102 nm in size. Nanoparticles bound and protected mRNA from RNase degradation, while exhibiting low cytotoxicity in the human embryonic kidney (HEK293), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), and nasopharyngeal (KB) cells in culture Moderate cytotoxicity evidenced in the colorectal carcinoma (Caco-2) and colon carcinoma (HT-29) cells was attributed to apoptosis induction by selenium, as confirmed by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining.

Although some patients achieve durable responses to checkpoint blockade, not all experience such benefits, and some suffer from significant immunotoxicities. Given this, biomarkers that predict response to therapy are essential, and testing for tumor programmed death ligand 1(PD-L1) expression is the current standard. The extent of PD-L1 expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) has demonstrated a correlation with treatment response, although limitations with this marker exist. Recently, tumor mutational burden has emerged as an alternative biomarker, and studies have demonstrated its utility, irrespective of the PD-L1 level of a tumor.

The CAR molecule, which recognizes cell-surface tumor-associated antigen independently of human leukocyte antigen (HLA), is composed by one or more signaling molecules to activate genetically modified T cells for killing, proliferation, and cytokine production.In order to make this treatment available for a larger number of patients, we developed a simple and efficient platform to generate and expand CAR-T cells.Our approach is based on a lentiviral vector composed by a second-generation CAR that signals through a 41BB and CD3-ζ endodomain.In this work, we show a high-level production of the lentiviral vector, which was successfully used to generate CAR-T cells. The CAR-T cells produced were highly cytotoxic and specific against CD19+ cells in vitro and in vivo, being able to fully control disease progression in a xenograft B-cell lymphoma mouse model. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of producing CAR-T cells in an academic context and can serve as a paradigm for similar institutions.

However, identifying patients for the potential therapeutic response and predicting therapy resistance and early relapse remains a challenge.Between 2016 and 2018, 60 patients were treated with pembrolizumab, among who 12 NSCLC patients had both baseline (before treatment) and serial (on treatment) periodical circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) samples. Those samples were sequenced on a 329 pan cancer-related gene panel. Analyses of tumor burden, blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB), maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF), and tumor clonal structure were performed in association with clinical response. Candidate resistance mutations involved in relapse and metastases were further investigated.ctDNA was detected and mutational profiling was performed for each patient. Those with a high baseline bTMB level showed significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) after pembrolizumab treatment. Tumor burden and therapeutic response significantly correlated with the MSAF instead of the bTMB. Clone analysis detected tumor progression about 2-4 months ahead of computed tomography (CT) scan. One mutation in gene PTCH1 (Protein patched homolog 1) and two acquired anti-PD1 candidate resistance mutations of gene B2M (β2 microglobulin) were identified in association with distant metastasis. The evolutionary tree of a representative patient was also described.This pilot study showed that MSAF could be another good indicator of therapeutic response, and clonal analysis could be clinically useful in monitoring clonal dynamics and detecting remote metastasis and early relapse.© 2019 The Authors.

Despite these developments, there is still an unmet clinical need for more advanced combination therapies for the subset of patients who remain resistant to  or targeted therapy alone. To our knowledge, no reports have been published on combinations of PD-1 blockades and c-KIT inhibitors in melanoma patients. Furthermore, data are limited regarding the safety and efficacy of this combination in patients harboring KIT mutations.We report a case of an 82-year-old female with metastatic melanoma who was found to have double KIT mutations at V559 and N822I.She was treated with a combination of c-KIT inhibitor and PD-1 blockade after being resistant to anti-PD-1 monotherapy.Patient developed two episodes of grade 2 liver toxicity requiring treatment breaks followed by a dose reduction. Her transaminitis eventually resolved and patient remained on combination treatment for almost two years with good control of her disease prior to progression.Treatment options for patients who progress after PD-1 inhibitors are very limited; therefore, there is a high unmet clinical need for this patient population. Combining Imatinib with checkpoint inhibitors may be efficacious in patients with metastatic melanoma and KIT mutations.

Chimigen® Molecules are fusion proteins of antigen(s) with the Fc fragment of a xenotypic antibody designed to target specific receptors on dendritic cells (DCs). Here we describe the production and pre-clinical evaluation of Chimigen® HBV (C-HBV), containing HBV PreS1 and PreS2 peptide fragments, HBV core and murine Fc, produced in insect cells. C-HBV binding to immature DCs and internalization by endocytosis was FcγRII (CD32) and mannose receptor (CD206) dependent and led to increased MHC I and MHC II surface expression. Upon exposure of human T cells isolated from HBV un-infected healthy and chronically HBV-infected donors to C-HBV-pulsed mature DCs , C-HBV induced vigorous T cell proliferation and enhanced expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α, perforin and granzyme B in both CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets. Re-stimulation of C-HBV-activated T cells from chronically infected donors with HBV PreS1/PreS2 and core overlapping peptides induced IFN-γ production in both CD4 and CD8 populations. C-HBV-activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from chronically HBV-infected patients stimulated granzyme B production by CD4CD25 T responder (Tresp) cells, accompanied by an increase in Annexin V staining on CD4CD25 T regulatory (Treg) cell phenotype, consistent with apoptosis.

Cytokines are critical to influencing the immune responses and interactions with non-immune cells. Recently, the IL-12 and IL-6 family of cytokines have accumulated newly defined members each with specific immune functions related to various cancers and tumorigenesis. There is a need to better understand how cytokines like IL-27, IL-30, and IL-35 interact with one another, and how a developing tumor can exploit these interactions to enhance immune suppression. Current cytokine-based immunotherapies are associated with cytotoxic side effects which limits the success of treatment.

In this review, we bring forth IL-27, IL-30, and IL-35, "sister cytokines," along with more recent additions to the IL-12 family, which serve distinct purposes despite sharing structural similarities. We highlight how these cytokines function in the tumor microenvironment by examining their direct effects on cancer cells as well their indirect actions via regulatory functions of immune cells that act to either instigate or inhibit tumor progression. Understanding the context dependent immunomodulatory outcomes of these sister cytokines, as well as their regulation within the tumor microenvironment, may shed light onto novel cancer therapeutic treatments or targets.Copyright © 2019 Kourko, Seaver, Odoardi, Basta and Gee.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683809>Hyperprogressive Disease during Anti-PD-1 (PDCD1) / PD-L1 (CD274) Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>Hyperprogressive disease (HPD) is a recently acknowledged pattern of rapid tumor progression after the initiation of immune checkpoint inhibitors. HPD has been observed across various types of tumors and has been associated with poor survival.

A total of nine articles was eligible (217 HPD cases, 1519 cancer patients) for meta-analysis. There was no standard definition of HPD, and the incidence of HPD ranged from 1 to 30%. We identified twenty-three baseline patient factors, of which five factors were statistically significantly associated with HPD. These were serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) above the upper normal limit (OR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.02-3.49,  = 0.043), more than two metastatic sites (OR = 1.86, 1.34-2.57,  < 0.001), liver metastases (OR = 3.33, 2.07-5.34,  < 0.001), Royal Marsden Hospital prognostic score of 2 or above (OR = 3.33, 1.96-5.66,  < 0.001), and positive PD-L1 expression status that was inversely correlated with HPD (OR = 0.60, 0.36-0.99,  = 0.044).

Univariate survival analysis found that positive PD-L1 expression were correlated with poor overall survival (P = 0.004) and inferior disease-free survival (P < 0.001).

This study is a non-randomized retrospective analysis of patients in one subset of patients seen by research nurses who operated in the standard head/neck and lung team not including patients in the phase 1 program. All patients were enrolled in clinical trials from January 16, 2013 to May 28, 2018 at USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Institute in Los Angeles. Patients who were required to give fresh research biopsies prior to intervention were part of the research biopsy group.  In total, 76 patients were analyzed in this study. Thirty-three patients were in the research biopsygroup and 43 patients were in the no biopsy group. Trials that required a fresh biopsy had a longer median screening duration (30 vs. 14 days) than trials that did not require a biopsy ( < 0.0001).  Our study shows that requiring biopsies prior to clinical trial treatment results in a statistically significant delay in treatment. The informed consent forms that were part of clinical trials involving mandatory research biopsies did not reflect this delay in treatment. However, these delays did not result in a statistically significant decrease in number of days on trial or days until progression of disease.Copyright © 2019 Cheng, Tiulim, Zhou, El-Khoueiry and Nieva.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694838>Management of pulmonary toxicity associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.</a></h2><p> has become a standard of care in oncology, following the recent approvals of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 and programmed cell death-1 inhibitors in lung cancer, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, bladder, head and neck cancers.

The positive clinical effects of this therapy have been associated to increased Th17 response and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) against to tumor antigens. Some synthetic compounds, such as diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP), are capable of triggering a DTH response in cutaneous malignancies and also to induce clinically relevant effects against melanoma. In this work, we evaluated Litre extract (LExT), a standardized extract of a Chilean stinging plant,  (Litre). As Litre plant is known to induce DTH, we used a murine B16 melanoma model to compare the topical and intratumor efficacy of LExT with synthetic DTH inducers (DPCP and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene [DNCB]). LExt contained mainly long chain catechols and sesquiterpenes. The intratumor injection of LExT induced a significant delay in tumor growth, similarly topical treatment of an established tumor with 0.1% LExT ointment induced a growth delay and even tumor regression in 15% of treated animals. No significant changes were observed on the T-cell populations associated to LExT treatment, and neither DNCB nor DPCP were capable to induce none of the LExT-induced antitumoral effects.

Among young children, atopic dermatitis, lower respiratory tract infections, and increased levels of total Immunoglobulin E (IgE) and allergen-specific IgE are important determinants.Breastfeeding has been demonstrated being protective for the onset of asthma. Allergen  has also been shown to have significant preventive effect decreasing asthma development. Inhaled corticosteroids use in early childhood prevents exacerbations but does not alter the natural history of asthma. Other interventions, such as the use of palivizumab, probiotics, vitamin D supplementation, and fish consumption presented controversial results.A good knowledge of risk factors for asthma development, from prenatal period to adulthood, may lead to efficacious preventive strategies.

The therapeutic index of this emerging modality is attenuated by the occurrence of immunologic toxicity syndromes that occur upon CAR T cell engraftment. Here we report on the low incidence of severe cytokine release syndrome in subjects treated with defined ratio CD4:CD8 T cell composition 4-1BB:zeta CAR T cell product who also received early intervention treatment. We report that early intervention with the administration of tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids may reduce the frequency at which subjects transition from mild CRS to severe CRS. While early intervention doubled the numbers of subjects dosed with tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids, there was no apparent detrimental effect on minimal residual disease negative complete remission rates, or subsequent persistence of functional CAR T cells compared to subjects who did not receive intervention. Moreover, early intervention therapy did not increase the propensity of subjects who experience neurotoxicity or place subjects at risk for infectious sequelae. These data support the contention that early intervention with the use of tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids in subjects with early signs of CRS is without negative impact on anti-tumor potency of CD19CAR T cells. This intervention serves to enhance the therapeutic index in relapsed/refractory patients and provides the rationale to apply CAR T cell therapy more broadly in ALL therapy.

Most preclinical studies have focused on T cell responses to antigen-specific stimulation. In contrast, little is known on the regulation of T cell responsiveness through continuous TCR triggering and consequent tonic signaling. Here, we addressed the question whether increasing the TCR affinity can lead to chronic interactions occurring directly between TCRs and MHC-(self) molecules, which may modulate the overall functional potency of tumor-redirected CD8 T cells. For this purpose, we developed two complementary human CD8 T cell models (i.e. HLA-A2 knock-in and knock-out) engineered with incremental-affinity TCRs to the HLA-A2/NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen.The impact of HLA-A2 recognition, depending on TCR affinity, was assessed at the levels of the TCR/CD3 complex, regulatory receptors, and signaling, under steady-state conditions and in kinetic studies. The quality of CD8 T cell responses was further evaluated by gene expression and multiplex cytokine profiling, as well as real-time quantitative cell killing, combined with co-culture assays.We found that HLA-A2 per se (in absence of cognate peptide) can trigger chronic activation followed by a tolerance-like state of tumor-redirected CD8 T cells with increased-affinity TCRs. HLA-A2 but not HLA-A2 T cells displayed an activation phenotype, associated with enhanced upregulation of c-CBL and multiple inhibitory receptors. T cell activation preceded TCR/CD3 downmodulation, impaired TCR signaling and functional hyporesponsiveness. This stepwise activation-to-hyporesponsive state was dependent on TCR affinity and already detectable at the upper end of the physiological affinity range (K ≤ 1 μM). Similar findings were made when affinity-increased HLA-A2 CD8 T cells were chronically exposed to HLA-A2-expressing target cells.Our observations indicate that sustained interactions between affinity-increased TCR and self-MHC can directly adjust the functional potential of T cells, even in the absence of antigen-specific stimulation. The observed tolerance-like state depends on TCR affinity and has therefore potential implications for the design of affinity-improved TCRs for adoptive T cell therapy, as several engineered TCRs currently used in clinical trials share similar affinity properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694137>[Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor microenvironment and related therapy].</a></h2><p>Neuroendocrine tumor(NET) is a kind of highly heterogeneous and ubiquitous tumor, frequently localized in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas.

Treatment is often initiated based on the severity of symptoms, physical examination findings, and, for some patients, the FEV or peak expiratory flow rates. Comorbidities such as gastroesophageal reflux disease and laryngopharyngeal reflux, rhinitis or rhinosinusitis, sleep apnea, recurrent infections, smoking, and substance abuse should be addressed. Two treatment modalities are indicated only for individuals with allergic asthma: allergen-specific  (commonly known as allergy shots), and biologic therapies that target type-2 (T2) inflammation. Allergen  is effective in decreasing symptoms and medication use in select patients with mild-to-moderate allergic asthma. In addition, patients who receive allergen  for allergic rhinitis may have a decreased risk of developing asthma. Omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, and dupilumab are monoclonal antibodies that target T2 inflammation and are indicated for either moderate-to-severe or severe asthma. These have been well studied to improve asthma symptoms and have specific characteristics unique to each individual medication.

Growing preclinical data show that combining vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can prime intensified immunogenicity and modulate immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, we focus on the safety and efficacy of approved and promising cancer vaccines alone or combined with ICIs in the treatment of several malignancies. Generally, the majority of clinical trials support the concept of synergy that combination therapy of vaccines and ICIs holds maximized potential to improve clinical outcomes. Importantly, the combination has acceptable safety and minimal additional toxicity compared with single-agent vaccines or ICIs. Additionally, the potential strategies of combining personalized tumor vaccines with ICIs will become priority option and future direction of vaccine development and application and the urgent need to develop effective biomarkers to screen appropriate patient populations and predict response to combination therapy.Copyright © 2019 Zhao, Chen, Ding and Liu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686137>Predictors of Overall and Progression-Free Survival in Patients with Ocular Melanoma Metastatic to the Liver Undergoing Y90 Radioembolization.</a></h2><p>To investigate predictors of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with ocular melanoma metastatic to the liver undergoing yttrium-90 (Y90) radioembolization, including the effect of concurrent .An IRB-approved retrospective review of 24 patients with ocular melanoma metastatic to the liver who underwent Y-90 treatment between June 2003 and January 2018 was performed.

Further directions in programming the immune system focus on the design of immunomodulatory biomaterials that can recruit, engage with, and program immune cells locally in vivo. Here, we synthesized shear-thinning and self-healing polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogels as a tunable and injectable biomaterial platform for local dendritic cell (DC) recruitment. PNP gels were formed from two populations of poly(ethylene glycol)--polylactide (PEG--PLA) NPs with the same diameter but different PEG brush length (2 or 5 kDa). PEG--PLA NPs with the longer PEG brush exhibited improved gel formation following self-assembly and faster recovery after shear-thinning. In all cases, model protein therapeutics were released via Fickian diffusion in vitro, and minor differences in the release rate between the gel formulations were observed. PNP hydrogels were loaded with the DC cytokine CCL21 and injected subcutaneously in a murine model. CCL21-loaded PNP hydrogels recruited DCs preferentially to the site of injection in vivo relative to non-CCL21-loaded hydrogels. Thus, PNP hydrogels comprise a simple and tunable platform biomaterial for in vivo immunomodulation following minimally invasive subcutaneous injection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695808>Integrin αβ-targeted radionuclide therapy combined with immune checkpoint blockade  synergistically enhances anti-tumor efficacy.</a></h2><p>Radiotherapy combined with  has revealed promising outcomes in both preclinical studies and ongoing clinical trials. Targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) is a branch of radiotherapy concerned with the use of radioisotopes, radiolabeled molecules or nanoparticles that deliver particulate radiation to cancer cells. TRT is a promising approach in cases of metastatic disease where conventional treatments are no longer effective. The increasing use of TRT raises the question of how to best integrate TRT with . In this study, we proposed a novel therapeutic regimen that combined programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-based  with peptide-based TRT (Lu as the radionuclide) in the murine colon cancer model.To explore the most appropriate timing of  after radionuclide therapy, the anti-PD-L1 antibody (αPD-L1 mAb) was delivered in a concurrent or sequential manner when Lu TRT was given.The results demonstrated that TRT led to an acute increase in PD-L1 expression on T cells, and TRT in combination with αPD-L1 mAb stimulated the infiltration of CD8 T cells, which improved local tumor control, overall survival and protection against tumor rechallenge. Moreover, our data revealed that the time window for this combination therapy may be critical to outcome.This therapeutic combination may be a promising approach to treating metastatic tumors in which TRT can be used.

The success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1) in melanoma quickly sprung to other cancer types and are considered the emerging face of oncology.Antibodies to CTLA-4 were first to enter the field, quickly followed by PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Combination anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies were investigated, and after demonstrating improved responses, rapidly gained approval. Certain tumor types previously considered non-immunogenic also demonstrated durable responses which has been a remarkable discovery. However, not all tumor types respond to immunotherapies and it is widely recognized that tumor-specific immune inflammatory status predicts the best responders. Ongoing translational work indicates specific upregulation in additional immune checkpoints that circumvent response to anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies.

Recently, a new global transcriptomic immune classification of solid tumours has identified six immune subtypes (ISs) (C1-C6). Our aim was to specifically characterise ISs in colorectal cancer (CRC) and assess their interplay with the consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs).Clinical and molecular information, including CMSs and ISs, were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (N = 625). Immune cell populations, differential gene expression and gene set enrichment analysis were performed to characterise ISs in the global CRC population by using CMSs.Only 5 ISs were identified in CRC, predominantly C1 wound healing (77%) and C2 IFN-γ dominant (17%). CMS1 showed the highest proportion of C2 (53%), whereas C1 was particularly dominant in CMS2 (91%). CMS3 had the highest representation of C3 inflammatory (7%) and C4 lymphocyte depleted ISs (4%), whereas all C6 TGF-β dominant cases belonged to CMS4 (2.3%). Prognostic relevance of ISs in CRC substantially differed from that reported for the global TCGA, and ISs had a greater ability to stratify the prognosis of CRC patients than CMS classification. C2 had higher densities of CD8, CD4 activated, follicular helper T cells, regulatory T cells and neutrophils and the highest M1/M2 polarisation. C2 had a heightened activation of pathways related to the immune system, apoptosis and DNA repair, mTOR signalling and oxidative phosphorylation, whereas C1 was more dependent of metabolic pathways.The correlation of IS and CMS allows a more precise categorisation of patients with relevant clinical and biological implications, which may be valuable tools to improve tailored therapeutic interventions in CRC patients.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

CD59 is a GPI-anchored membrane protein that prevents complement activation by inhibiting the formation of the membrane attack complex, which may protect cancer cells from complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). The interactions between CD59, TAMs and pancreatic cancer remain largely unknown. A tissue microarray of pancreatic cancer patients was used to evaluate the interrelationship of CD59 and TAMs and their survival impacts were analyzed. In a coculture system, THP-1 cells were used as a model to study the function of TAMs and the roles of pancreatic cancer-educated macrophages in regulating the expression of CD59 in pancreatic cancer cells were demonstrated by real-time PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence staining. The effects of macrophages on regulating CDC in pancreatic cancer cells were demonstrated by an in vitro study. To explore the potential mechanisms, RNA sequencing of pancreatic cancer cells with or without co-culture of THP-1 macrophages was performed, and the results showed that the IL-6R/STAT3 signaling pathway might participate in the regulation, which was further demonstrated by target-siRNA transfection, antibody neutralization and STAT3 inhibitors. Our data revealed that the infiltration of TAMs and the expression of CD59 of pancreatic cancer were paralleled, and higher infiltration of TAMs and higher expression of CD59 predicted worse survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Pancreatic cancer-educated macrophages could protect cancer cells from CDC by up-regulating CD59 via the IL-6R/STAT3 signaling pathway.

To date, a large number of clinical trials involving DC-based vaccines have been conducted with a view to treating tumors of different histological origins. However, DC-based vaccines had several drawbacks, including problems with targeted delivery of tumor antigens to DCs and prolong storage of cellular vaccines. Therefore, the development of other immunotherapeutic approaches capable of enhancing the immunogenicity of existing DC-based vaccines or directly triggering anti-tumor immune responses is of great interest. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by almost all types of eukaryotic cells for paracrine signaling. EVs can interact with target cells and change their functional activity by delivering different signaling molecules including mRNA, non-coding RNA, proteins, and lipids. EVs have potential benefits as natural vectors for the delivery of RNA and other therapeutic molecules targeted to DCs, T-lymphocytes, and tumor cells; therefore, EVs are a promising entity for the development of novel cell-free anti-tumor vaccines that may be a favourable alternative to DC-based vaccines. In the present review, we discuss the anti-tumor potential of EVs derived from DCs, tumors, and other cells. Methods of EV isolation are systematized, and key molecules carried by EVs that are necessary for the activation of a DC-mediated anti-tumor immune response are analyzed with a focus on the RNA component of EVs. Characteristics of anti-tumor immune responses induced by EVs  and  are reviewed. Finally, perspectives and challenges with the use of EVs for the development of anti-tumor cell-free vaccines are considered.Copyright © 2019 Markov, Oshchepkova and Mironova.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695411>PD-1 inhibitors dependent CD8 T cells inhibit mouse colon cancer cell metastasis.</a></h2><p>Colon cancer is a common digestive tract malignancy which ranks as the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. A current focus of anti-cancer research is harnessing the patient's own immune system for therapy. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), an immune suppressor, is upregulated in various activated immune cells, such as T cells, and in viral infections and tumors.The objective of this study was to investigate the function of PD-1 inhibitor on the metastasisi of mouse colon cancer cells.In the present study, we established an in situ colon cancer mouse model using the CT26 cell line. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was performed to detect colon cancer cell metastasis. The levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-12 (IL-12) in serum and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were detected by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). CD44 CD62L memory T cells, CD4 FoxP3 regulatory T cells, and IFN-γ and TNF-α levels in MLNs and spleen were detected by flow cytometry (FCM).We found that anti-PD-1 therapy inhibited colon cancer cells metastasis to the small intestine, liver, and lung, and lengthened the survival time of mice. However, the depletion of CD8 suppressed the activity of anti-PD-1 antibodies. In response to anti-PD-1 , the levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-12 (IL-12) in serum and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were significantly increased, while IL-6, IL-17, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) were decreased. CD8 depletion had the opposite effect. In addition, anti-PD-1 treatment significantly increased CD44 CD62L memory T cells, decreased CD4 FoxP3 regulatory T cells, and increased IFN-γ and TNF-α levels in MLNs and spleen. Furthermore, anti-PD-1 treatment cannot exert these roles when CD8 is depleted.These results suggest that PD-1 inhibitors rely on CD8+ T cells to exert anti-tumor immunity in colon cancer.© 2019 Gao et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687029>Autoimmune Limbic Encephalitis in a Patient with Acute Encephalopathy and Hyponatremia.</a></h2><p>Acute encephalopathy is a common clinical presentation for hospital admissions.

Among these CNA genes, five driver genes, including PI3KCA, PI3KCB, DVL3, WWTR1, and ERBB2, exhibited a strong association with immune cell infiltration, suggesting that the pathways that they participate in may be involved in regulating immune cell infiltration. Moreover, we also observed that the genes of immunotherapeutic targets were abundantly expressed in the wild-type samples, suggesting that  based on these immunotherapeutic targets may be applied to wild-type samples. In addition, the two CNA driver genes, DVL3 and ERBB2, might be sensitive and resistant biomarkers for examining the tumor's response to chemoradiotherapy, respectively. Particularly, the expression of ERBB2 was also observed to be higher in responders of chemotherapy than non-responders. Furthermore, a subset of CNA genes was identified to predict the prognosis of cervical cancer. In summary, our systematic data analysis of these CNA genes not only improved our understanding of the veiled mechanism behind immune cell infiltration, but also provided the potential clinical application of these CNA genes in cervical cancer.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Between March 2016 and January 2018, we conducted a pilot study in 89 patients, who had refractory/relapsed B-cell malignancies, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sequential infusion of anti-CD19 and anti-CD22, two single-specific, third-generation chimeric antigen receptor-engineered (CAR19/22) T-cell "cocktail". Among the 51 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the minimal residual disease-negative response rate was 96.0% (95% confidence interval (CI), 86.3 to 99.5). With a median follow-up of 16.7 months (range, 1.3 to 33.3), the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 13.6 months (95% CI, 6.5 to not reached, NR), and the median overall survival (OS) was 31.0 months (95% CI, 10.6 to NR). Among the 38 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the overall response rate was 72.2% (95% CI, 54.8 to 85.8), with a complete response rate of 50.0% (95% CI, 32.9 to 67.1). With a median follow-up of 14.4 months (range, 0.4 to 27.4), the median PFS was 9.9 months (95% CI, 3.3 to NR), and the median OS was 18.0 months (95% CI, 6.1 to NR). Antigen loss relapse occurred in one patient during follow-up. High-grade cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity occurred in 22.4% and 1.12% patients, respectively. All except one were reversible. Our results indicated that sequential infusion of CAR19/22 T-cell was safe, efficacious, and may have reduced the rate of antigen escape relapse in B-cell malignancies.

The past decade has witnessed historical advancement of cancer . A myriad of approaches have been explored to elicit or augment anticancer innate immunity and/or adaptive immunity. Recently, activation of stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING), an intracellular receptor residing in the endoplasmic reticulum, has shown great potential to enhance antitumor immunity through the induction of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including type I IFNs. A number of natural and synthetic STING agonists have been discovered or developed, and tested in preclinical models and in the clinic for the  of diseases such as cancer and infectious diseases. Cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), such as cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), cyclic dimeric adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP), and cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), are a class of STING agonists that can elicit immune responses. However, natural CDNs are hydrophilic small molecules with negative charges and are susceptible to enzymatic degradation, leading to low bioavailability in target tissues yet unwanted toxicities and narrow therapeutic windows. Drug delivery systems, coupled with nucleic acid chemistry, have been exploited to address these challenges. Here, we will discuss the underlying immunological mechanisms and approaches to STING activation, with a focus on the delivery of STING agonists, for cancer .© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692804>[Occipital condyle syndrome: the visible part of the iceberg].</a></h2><p>Occipital condyle syndrome is a rare clinical disorder, clinically defined by the association of intense occipital headaches and paralysis of the twelfth paired cranial nerve.

The favorable expression pattern has encouraged the development and clinical testing of 5T4-targeted antibody and vaccine therapies. 5T4 also represents a compelling and unexplored target for T-cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T-cell therapy. Our group has previously isolated high-avidity CD8 T-cell clones specific for an HLA-A2-restricted 5T4 epitope (residues 17-25; 5T4). In this report, targeted single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on 5T4-specific T-cell clones to sequence the highly variable complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of T-cell receptor α chain (TRA) and β chain (TRB) genes. Full-length TRA and TRB sequences were cloned into lentiviral vectors and transduced into CD8 T-cells from healthy donors. Redirected effector T-cell function against 5T4 was measured by cytotoxicity and cytokine release assays. Seven unique TRA-TRB pairs were identified. All seven TCRs exhibited high expression on CD8 T-cells with transduction efficiencies from 59 to 89%. TCR-transduced CD8 T-cells demonstrated redirected cytotoxicity and cytokine release in response to 5T4 on target-cells and killed 5T4/HLA-A2 kidney-, breast-, and colorectal-tumor cell lines as well as primary RCC tumor cells in vitro. TCR-transduced CD8 T-cells also detected presentation of 5T4 in TAP1/2-deficient T2 target-cells. TCR-transduced T-cells redirected to recognize the 5T4 epitope from a broadly shared tumor antigen are of interest for future testing as a cellular  strategy for HLA-A2 subjects with 5T4 tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679251>T Cell Receptors for Gene Transfer in Adoptive T Cell Therapy.</a></h2><p>The past decade has seen enormous progress in cancer . Checkpoint inhibitors are a class of  that act to recruit endogenous T cells of a patient's immune system against cancer-associated peptide- MHC antigens. In this process, mutated antigenic peptides referred to as neoantigens often serve as the target on cancer cells that are recognized by the T cell receptor (TCR) on endogenous T cells. Another successful  has involved adoptive T cell therapy, where therapeutic doses of T cells expressing a gene for an anti-cancer receptor are delivered to a patient. This approach has been used primarily against hematopoietic cancers using synthetic receptors called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). CARs typically contain an antibody fragment (single-chain Fv, scFv) against a cancer cell surface antigen such as the B cell molecule CD19. While therapeutic CARs (and full antibodies) target antigens expressed on cell surfaces, TCRs can target a much larger array of intracellular proteins by binding to any cellular peptide associated with an MHC product. These cancer targets include self-peptides from aberrantly expressed/overexpressed proteins or neoantigens. In this review, we discuss the use of TCRs in adoptive T cell therapy and their target antigens. We focus on two properties that impact sensitivity, potency, and possible toxic cross-reactivity of TCR-mediated therapy: (1) the affinity of the TCR for the target antigen, and (2) the density of the target antigen. Finally, we provide a comprehensive listing of the current clinical trials that involve TCRs in adoptive T cell cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680346>A Multifunctional Cascade Bioreactor Based on Hollow-Structured Cu MoS for Synergetic Cancer Chemo-Dynamic Therapy/Starvation Therapy/Phototherapy/ with Remarkably Enhanced Efficacy.</a></h2><p>The unique tumor microenvironment (TME) facilitates cancer proliferation and metastasis, and it is hard to cure cancer completely via monotherapy. Herein, a multifunctional cascade bioreactor based on hollow mesoporous Cu MoS (CMS) loaded with glucose oxidase (GOx) is constructed for synergetic cancer therapy by chemo-dynamic therapy (CDT)/starvation therapy/phototherapy/. The CMS harboring multivalent elements (Cu , Mo ) exhibit Fenton-like, glutathione (GSH) peroxidase-like and catalase-like activity. Once internalized into the tumor, CMS could generate ·OH for CDT via Fenton-like reaction and deplete overexpressed GSH in TME to alleviate antioxidant capability of the tumors. Moreover, under hypoxia TME, the catalase-like CMS could react with endogenous H O to generate O for activating the catalyzed oxidation of glucose by GOx for starvation therapy accompanied with the regeneration of H O . The regenerated H O can devote to Fenton-like reaction for realizing GOx-catalysis-enhanced CDT. Meanwhile, the CMS under 1064 nm laser irradiation shows remarkable tumor-killing ability by phototherapy due to its excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (η = 63.3%) and cytotoxic superoxide anion (·O  ) generation performance. More importantly, the PEGylated CMS@GOx-based synergistic therapy combined with checkpoint blockade therapy could elicit robust immune responses for both effectively ablating primary tumors and inhibiting cancer metastasis.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We tested whether T lymphocytes could be rendered sensitive to erythropoietin (Epo) through ectopic expression of its wild-type receptor, or a truncated form (EpoRm) which augments Epo signaling in erythrocyte progenitors. Both receptors could be expressed in human T lymphocytes; Epo ligation induced STAT5 phosphorylation, which was abrogated by non-toxic concentrations of the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. EpoRm had higher expression and triggered more potent stimulation than its wild-type counterpart, including superior T-cell survival and proliferation. Using a bicistronic vector, we expressed EpoRm together with an anti-CD19-41BB-CD3z chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), while maintaining the functions of each receptor. In the presence of Epo, EpoRm-CAR-T cells had greater ex vivo expansion than CAR-T cells, and killed CD19+ leukemic cells more effectively in long-term cultures. In immunodeficient mice, physiologic levels of murine Epo were sufficient to preferentially expand EpoRm-CAR-T cells, yielding a significantly higher anti-leukemic activity. Thus, outfitting adoptive T cells with EpoRm should yield greater effector-to-target ratios with a smaller number of infused cells; Epo or ruxolitinib administration could be used to adjust their levels post-infusion, maximizing anti-tumor activity and minimizing toxicity.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Hematology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686247>First-line PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy vs chemotherapy alone for negative or < 1% PD-L1-expressing metastatic non-small-cell lung cancers.</a></h2><p>Single-agent anti-PD-1/PD-L1 clinical efficacy against < 1% PD-L1-expressing non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) is controversial.This meta-analysis examined randomized-trial data comparing first-line PD-1/PD-L1-inhibitor + chemotherapy (CT) vs CT alone for advanced < 1% PD-L1 NSCLCs.

Activation of beta-adrenergic signaling results in suppression of antitumor immune response and limits the efficacy of cancer . Beta-adrenergic signaling is also involved in regulation of hematopoietic reconstitution, which is critical to the graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect and to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

The advent of checkpoint blockade  over the past few years represents a paradigm shift in cancer therapy. However, the prevalence of severe immune-related adverse events with CTLA-4 and PD1 pathway blockade in clinical studies especially in combination therapy groups, is a cause for concern. Immunotherapies with cytokines have also been extensively explored but they have been associated with adverse events in clinical trials. Oncolytic vectors engineered to express checkpoint blockade antibodies and cytokines could provide an avenue for reducing the clinical toxicity associated with systemic therapy by concentrating the immunomodulatory payload at the site of disease. In this study, we engineered six different recombinant viruses, NDVs expressing checkpoint inhibitors (rNDV-anti-PD1 and rNDV-anti-PDL1), superagonists (rNDV-anti-CD28) and immunocytokines, where these antibodies are fused to an immunostimulatory cytokine such as IL12 (rNDV-anti-CD28-mIL12, rNDV-anti-PD1-mIL12 and rNDV-anti-PDL1-mIL12). These six engineered viruses induced tumor control and survival benefit both in a highly aggressive unilateral and bilateral B16-F10 murine melanoma model, indicative of an abscopal effect. The data represent a strong proof-of-concept, on which further clinical evaluation could build. Checkpoint inhibitor therapy has shown tremendous efficacy but also frequent and often severe side effects-especially when multiple drugs of this class are used simultaneously. Similarly, many investigational  agents, which have shown promise in animal models, have failed in clinical trials due to dose-limiting toxicity when administered systemically. This study utilized a murine melanoma model to evaluate the efficacy of intratumoral injections of recombinant NDVs engineered to express multiple immunotherapeutic proteins with well-documented side effects in humans. Our results indicate that intratumoral administration of these recombinant NDVs, particularly when combined with systemic CTLA4 checkpoint inhibition, exerts a robust effect in treated and non-treated tumors indicative of a systemic anti-tumoral response. The intratumoral delivery of rNDVs expressing immunotherapeutic proteins may be an effective method of targeting immune cell populations most relevant for anti-tumoral immunity and allowing to restrict the use of systemic  agents.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698455>Rational design of a trimeric APRIL-based CAR-binding domain enables efficient targeting of multiple myeloma.</a></h2><p>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells (CARTs) have shown tremendous potential for the treatment of certain B-cell malignancies, including patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Targeting the B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) has produced the most promising results for CART therapy of MM to date, but not all remissions are sustained. Emergence of BCMA escape variants has been reported under the selective pressure of monospecific anti-BCMA CART treatment. Thus, there is a clinical need for continuous improvement of CART therapies for MM. Here, we show that a novel trimeric APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand)-based CAR efficiently targets both BCMA+ and BCMA- MM. Modeled after the natural ligand-receptor pair, APRIL-based CARs allow for bispecific targeting of the MM-associated antigens BCMA and transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI). However, natural ligands as CAR antigen-binding domains may require further engineering to promote optimal binding and multimerization to adequately trigger T-cell activation. We found that using a trimeric rather than a monomeric APRIL format as the antigen-binding domain enhanced binding to BCMA and TACI and CART activity against MM in vitro and in vivo. Dual-specific, trimeric APRIL-based CAR are a promising therapeutic approach for MM with potential for preventing and treating BCMA escape.© 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677848>Anti-CD19 CAR T-Cell Therapy for B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.</a></h2><p>CAR T-cells are autologous T-cells transduced with a chimeric antigen receptor which targets the modified T-cell against a specified cancer antigen.

Subsequently, studies aiming to validate clinical efficacy of this oral treatment were complicated by a number of factors, including the modification of clinical definitions, the implications of which were not recognized at that time. The objective of this review is to integrate our pre-clinical and clinical research in this field conducted over the past 30 years to demonstrate the evolution of the idea of communication between mucosal surfaces through the common mucosal immune system and the development of an effective oral NTHi . Our earliest studies recruited subjects with chronic sputum production and high levels of culture-positive sputum for Gram-negative bacteria but by 2000, the clinical diagnostic focus had switched from "chronic bronchitis" to "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease" (COPD), which was functionally defined using spirometry. This change led to variable clinical trial results, confirming the importance of chronic sputum production and culture-positive sputum. Additional conditioning factors such as patient age and gender were influential in study populations with low culture-positive sputum production. Through this period, studies in human and in rodent models provided new insights into airway protection mechanisms and the pathogenesis of airway inflammation. Key findings were the importance of a dysbiosis within the airway microbiome, and the critical role of an interdependence between the bronchus and the gut, with a Peyer's patch-dependent extra-bronchus "loop" controlling the composition of the bronchus microbiome. Within this context, intercurrent virus infections initiate a microbiome-dependant hypersensitivity reaction involving Peyer's patch-derived Th17 cells. We conclude that whole-cell killed NTHi  has consistent and significant benefits when examined in the context of changing clinical disease definitions, age and gender, and has the potential to change the natural history of chronic airway disease.© 2019 Clancy and Cripps.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681338>Demystifying Cancer  for Lay Audiences.</a></h2><p> is now mainstream.

In contrast to T cells, NK cells elicit rapid anti-tumor responses based on signals from activating and inhibitory cell surface receptors. They also lyse target cells via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, a critical mode of action of several therapeutic antibodies used to treat cancer. A body of evidence shows that NK cells can exhibit potent anti-tumor activity against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, disease-associated mechanisms often restrain the proper functions of endogenous NK cells, leading to inadequate tumor control and risk for disease progression. Although allogeneic NK cells can prevent leukemia relapse in certain settings of stem cell transplantation, not all patients are eligible for this type of therapy. Moreover, remissions induced by adoptively infused NK cells are only transient and require subsequent therapy to maintain durable responses. Hence, new strategies are needed to trigger full and durable anti-leukemia responses by NK cells in patients with myeloid malignancies. To achieve this, we need to better understand the interplay between the malignant cells, their microenvironment, and the NK cells. This review focuses on mechanisms that are involved in suppressing NK cells in patients with myeloid leukemia and MDS, and means to restore their full anti-tumor potential. It also discusses novel molecular targets and approaches, such as bi- and tri-specific antibodies and immune checkpoint inhibitors, to redirect and/or unleash the NK cells against the leukemic cells.Copyright © 2019 Carlsten and Järås.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690625>An engineered antibody fragment targeting mutant β-catenin via Major Histocompatibility Complex I neoantigen presentation.</a></h2><p>Mutations in CTNNB1, the gene encoding β-catenin, are common in colon and liver cancers, the most frequent mutation affecting Ser-45 in β-catenin. Peptides derived from wild-type β-catenin have previously been shown to be presented on the cell surface as part of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I, suggesting an opportunity for targeting this common driver gene mutation with antibody-based therapies. Here, crystal structures of both the wild-type and S45F mutant peptide bound to HLA-A*03:01 at 2.20 and 2.45 Å resolutions, respectively, confirmed the accessibility of the phenylalanine residue for antibody recognition. Phage display was then used to identify single chain variable fragment clones that selectively bind the S45F mutant peptide presented in HLA-A*03:01 and have minimal wild-type or other off-target binding. Following initial characterization of five clones, we selected a single clone, E10, for further investigation. We developed a computational model of the binding of E10 to the mutant peptide bound HLA-A3, incorporating data from affinity maturation as initial validation. In the future, our model may be used to design clones with maintained specificity and higher affinity. Such derivatives could be adapted into either cell-based (CAR-T) or protein-based (bispecific T-cell engagers) therapies to target cancer cells harboring the S45F mutation in CTNNB1.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695990>Neuroendocrine Tumor: A Rare, Aggressive Tumor of the Gallbladder.</a></h2><p>We report a case of rare and aggressive gallbladder neuroendocrine carcinoma (GB-NEC), diagnosed with the help of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).

Despite advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of fibrosis, it remains uncured. Fibrogenic processes share conserved core cellular and molecular pathways across organs. In this study, we aimed to elucidate shared and organ-specific features of fibrosis using murine precision-cut tissue slices (PCTS) prepared from small intestine, liver and kidneys. PCTS displayed substantial differences in their baseline gene expression profiles: 70% of the extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes were differentially expressed across the organs. Culture for 48 h induced significant changes in ECM regulation and triggered the onset of fibrogenesis in all PCTS in organ-specific manner. TGFβ signalling was activated during 48 h culture in all PCTS. However, the degree of its involvement varied: both canonical and non-canonical TGFβ pathways were activated in liver and kidney slices, while only canonical, Smad-dependent, cascade was involved in intestinal slices. The treatment with galunisertib blocked the TGFβRI/SMAD2 signalling in all PCTS, but attenuated culture-induced dysregulation of ECM homeostasis and mitigated the onset of fibrogenesis with organ-specificity. In conclusion, regardless the many common features in pathophysiology of organ fibrosis, PCTS displayed diversity in culture-induced responses and in response to the treatment with TGFβRI kinase inhibitor galunisertib, even though it targets a core fibrosis pathway. A clear understanding of the common and organ-specific features of fibrosis is the basis for developing novel antifibrotic therapies.Copyright © 2019.

While it has been established that intra-tumoral heterogeneity may have prognostic significance in HNSCC, we are only beginning to describe and define such heterogeneity at a cellular resolution. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have been critical in this regard, opening new avenues in our understanding of more nuanced tumor biology by identifying distinct cellular subpopulations, dissecting signaling within the tumor microenvironment, and characterizing cellular genomic mutations and copy number aberrations. The combined effect of these insights is likely to be robust and meaningful changes in existing diagnostic and treatment algorithms through the application of novel biomarkers as well as targeted therapeutics.

This technology enables the investigation of cancer-related genetic aberrations that are predominantly located in the exonic regions. WES delivers high-throughput results at a reasonable price. Here, we review analysis tools enabling utilization of WES data in clinical and research settings. Technically, WES initially allows the detection of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variations (CNVs), and data obtained through these methods can be combined and further utilized. Variant calling algorithms for SNVs range from standalone tools to machine learning-based combined pipelines. Tools for CNV detection compare the number of reads aligned to a dedicated segment. Both SNVs and CNVs help to identify mutations resulting in pharmacologically druggable alterations. The identification of homologous recombination deficiency enables the use of PARP inhibitors. Determining microsatellite instability and tumor mutation burden helps to select patients eligible for . To pave the way for clinical applications, we have to recognize some limitations of WES, including its restricted ability to detect CNVs, low coverage compared to targeted sequencing, and the missing consensus regarding references and minimal application requirements.

The maturation of next-generation sequencing is reinforced by Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved methods for cancer screening, detection, and follow-up.

Prophylaxis was administered during the neutropenic period following each chemotherapy cycle.The primary outcome was proven or probable invasive fungal disease as adjudicated by blinded central review. Secondary outcomes were invasive aspergillosis, empirical antifungal therapy, and overall survival.The second interim efficacy analysis and an unplanned futility analysis based on 394 patients appeared to have suggested futility, so the study was closed to accrual. Among the 517 participants who were randomized (median age, 9 years [range, 0-26 years]; 44% female), 508 (98%) completed the trial. The 23 proven or probable invasive fungal disease events (6 caspofungin vs 17 fluconazole) included 14 molds, 7 yeasts, and 2 fungi not further categorized. The 5-month cumulative incidence of proven or probable invasive fungal disease was 3.1% (95% CI, 1.3%-7.0%) in the caspofungin group vs 7.2% (95% CI, 4.4%-11.8%) in the fluconazole group (overall P = .03 by log-rank test) and for cumulative incidence of proven or probable invasive aspergillosis was 0.5% (95% CI, 0.1%-3.5%) with caspofungin vs 3.1% (95% CI, 1.4%-6.9%) with fluconazole (overall P = .046 by log-rank test). No statistically significant differences in empirical antifungal therapy (71.9% caspofungin vs 69.5% fluconazole, overall P = .78 by log-rank test) or 2-year overall survival (68.8% caspofungin vs 70.8% fluconazole, overall P = .66 by log-rank test) were observed. The most common toxicities were hypokalemia (22 caspofungin vs 13 fluconazole), respiratory failure (6 caspofungin vs 9 fluconazole), and elevated alanine transaminase (4 caspofungin vs 8 fluconazole).Among children, adolescents, and young adults with acute myeloid leukemia, prophylaxis with caspofungin compared with fluconazole resulted in significantly lower incidence of invasive fungal disease. The findings suggest that caspofungin may be considered for prophylaxis against invasive fungal disease, although study interpretation is limited by early termination due to an unplanned interim analysis that appeared to have suggested futility.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698088>Tumor antigenS heterogeneity and immune response-targeting neoantigens in breast cancer.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer is both the most common type of cancer and the most frequent cause of cancer mortality in women, mainly because of its heterogeneity and limited immunogenicity. The aim of specific active cancer  is to stimulate the host's immune response against cancer cells directly using a vaccine platform carrying one or more tumor antigens. In particular, the ideal tumor antigen should be able to elicit T cell and B cell responses, be specific for the tumor and be expressed at high levels on cancer cells. Neoantigens are ideal targets for  because they are exclusive to individual patient's tumors, are absent in healthy tissues and are not subject to immune tolerance mechanisms. Thus, neoantigens should generate a specific reaction towards tumors since they constitute the largest fraction of targets of tumor-infiltrating T cells.

Therapeutic treatment with rMVA-CD40L-expressing tumor-associated antigens results in the control of established tumors. The expansion of tumor-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells is essential for the therapeutic antitumor effects. Strikingly, rMVA-CD40L also induces strong natural killer (NK) cell activation and expansion.

The success of checkpoint blockade therapy has demonstrated the potentially curative value of preexisting tumor-primed T cells in cancer treatment. Given the results from checkpoint blockade therapy, we hypothesized that endogenous T cells contribute to long-term survival following ACT. Here, we describe a therapeutic approach combining ACT with an oncolytic vaccine that allows simultaneous analysis of antitumor immunity mediated by transferred and endogenous T cells. We found that, in addition to promoting the expansion and tumor infiltration of the transferred T cells, oncolytic vaccines boosted tumor-primed host T cells. We determined that transferred T cells contributed to rapid destruction of large tumor masses while endogenous T cells concurrently prevented the emergence of antigen-loss variants. Moreover, while transferred T cells disappeared shortly after tumor regression, endogenous T cells secured long-term memory with a broad repertoire of antigen specificity. Our findings suggest that this combination strategy may exploit the full potential of ACT and tumor-primed host T cells to eliminate the primary tumor, prevent immune escape, and provide long-term protective memory.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685557>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells at diagnosis may discriminate between benign and malignant ovarian tumors.</a></h2><p>The behavior of the immune system as a driver in the progression of ovarian cancer has barely been studied.

This implies differential regulation or response to cholesterol within different breast cancer subtypes. We evaluated differences in side-chain hydroxycholesterol and liver X nuclear receptor signalling between Oestrogen Receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative breast cancers and cell lines. Cell line models of ER-positive and ER-negative disease were treated with Liver X Receptor (LXR) ligands and transcriptional activity assessed using luciferase reporters, qPCR and MTT.

A central telephone randomisation service used a minimisation computer algorithm to allocate treatments in a 1 : 1 ratio.A total of 93 NHS hospitals throughout England, Northern Ireland and Wales.A total of 977 patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic myeloma.Patients were randomised to receive levofloxacin or placebo tablets for 12 weeks at the start of antimyeloma treatment. Treatment allocation was blinded and balanced by centre, estimated glomerular filtration rate and intention to give high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation. Follow-up was at 4-week intervals up to 16 weeks, with a further follow-up at 1 year.The primary outcome was to assess the number of febrile episodes (or deaths) in the first 12 weeks from randomisation. Secondary outcomes included number of deaths and infection-related deaths, days in hospital, carriage and invasive infections, response to antimyeloma treatment and its relation to infection, quality of life and overall survival within the first 12 weeks and beyond.In total, 977 patients were randomised (levofloxacin,  = 489; placebo,  = 488). A total of 134 (27%) events (febrile episodes,  = 119; deaths,  = 15) occurred in the placebo arm and 95 (19%) events (febrile episodes,  = 91; deaths,  = 4) occurred in the levofloxacin arm; the hazard ratio for time to first event (febrile episode or death) within the first 12 weeks was 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.51 to 0.86;  = 0.002).

The success of T cell-directed checkpoint inhibitors of CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 has opened a new approach for cancer  and resulted in extensive research on immune checkpoints. However, it is only in recent years that research on NK cell exhaustion and potential checkpoints impacting NK cells has become popular. NK cells, as the major player in innate immunity, are critical for immune surveillance, particularly the control of metastasis and hematological cancers. The balance between activating and inhibitory signals fine tunes the activation and effector functions of NK cells, and transformed cells modulate NK cells by upregulating negative signaling that "exhausts" NK cells. Exhausted NK cells with excessive expression of inhibitory receptors (checkpoint molecules) are impaired in the recognition of tumor cells as well as antitumor cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion. Therefore, an understanding of the potential checkpoint molecules involved in NK cell exhaustion is particularly important in terms of NK cell-targeted cancer .

ITH is a widely recognized feature of solid tumors and poses distinct challenges related to the development of effective therapeutic strategies, including cancer neoantigen vaccines. Here, we performed deep targeted DNA sequencing of multiple metastases from melanoma patients and observed ubiquitous sharing of clonal and subclonal single nucleotide variants (SNVs) encoding putative HLA class I-restricted neoantigen epitopes. However, spontaneous antitumor CD8+ T cell immunity in peripheral blood and tumors was restricted to a few clonal neoantigens featuring an oligo-/monoclonal T cell-receptor (TCR) repertoire. Moreover, in various tumors of the 4 patients examined, no neoantigen-specific TCR clonotypes were identified despite clonal neoantigen expression. Mature dendritic cell (mDC) vaccination with tumor-encoded amino acid-substituted (AAS) peptides revealed diverse neoantigen-specific CD8+ T responses, each composed of multiple TCR clonotypes. Isolation of T cell clones by limiting dilution from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) permitted functional validation regarding neoantigen specificity. Gene transfer of TCRαβ heterodimers specific for clonal neoantigens confirmed correct TCR clonotype assignments based on high-throughput TCRBV CDR3 sequencing.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have become the most promising type of treatment in oncology in general, and significantly so in NSCLC. Limited data is available about mechanisms of primary resistance. Data is lacking about mechanisms involved in acquired resistance or mixed responses in NSCLC. We aimed to identify mechanisms of resistance by studying biopsies taken from sites of secondary progression.We identified all cases of NSCLC that have received ICI for advanced disease in our institute. Of these cases, those that have demonstrated acquired resistance or mixed responses, and have underwent a biopsy from a progressive lesion were analyzed. Selected specimens were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS; Oncomine™ Solid Tumour Fusion Transcript Kit).Out of 664 lung cancer cases, 249 were NSCLC that have received ICI. Of these, eight cases matched our search criteria. Two of them demonstrated transformation to small cell lung cancer (SCLC; 2/8, 25%). NGS verified a common origin to a matched pre-treatment NSCLC specimen and an on-treatment progressive SCLC specimen. In two cases no tumor cells were found and in the remaining four the pathology was similar to the initial biopsy. In one of the cases of SCLC transformation platinum-etoposide chemotherapy was administered, with short-term benefit only and further disease progression.Mechanisms of acquired resistance to ICI include SCLC transformation.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) comprise populations of immature myeloid cells in tumor-bearing hosts with a highly immunosuppressive capacity. We could previously identify RIG-I-like helicases (RLH) as targets for the  of pancreatic cancer inducing immunogenic tumor cell death and type I interferons (IFN) as key mediators linking innate with adaptive immunity.Mice with orthotopically implanted Kras p53 Ptf1a-Cre (KPC) pancreatic tumors were treated intravenously with the RLH ligand polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), and the immune cell environment in tumor and spleen was characterized. A comprehensive analysis of the suppressive capacity as well as the whole transcriptomic profile of isolated MDSC subsets was performed. Antigen presentation capability of MDSC from mice with ovalbumin (OVA)-expressing tumors was investigated in T cell proliferation assays. The role of IFN in MDSC function was investigated in Ifnar1 mice.MDSC were strongly induced in orthotopic KPC-derived pancreatic cancer, and frequencies of MDSC subsets correlated with tumor weight and G-CSF serum levels, whereas other immune cell populations decreased. Administration of the RLH-ligand induced a IFN-driven immune response, with increased activation of T cells and dendritic cells (DC), and a reduced suppressive capacity of both polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSC and monocytic (M)-MDSC fractions. Whole transcriptomic analysis confirmed an IFN-driven gene signature of MDSC, a switch from a M2/G2- towards a M1/G1-polarized phenotype, and the induction of genes involved in the antigen presentation machinery. Nevertheless, MDSC failed to present tumor antigen to T cells. Interestingly, we found MDSC with reduced suppressive function in Ifnar1-deficient hosts; however, there was a common flaw in immune cell activation, which was reflected by defective immune cell activation and tumor control.We provide evidence that the treatment with immunostimulatory RNA reprograms the TME of pancreatic cancer by reducing the suppressive activity of MDSC, polarizing myeloid cells into a M1-like state and recruiting DC. We postulate that tumor cell-targeting combination strategies may benefit from RLH-based TME remodeling. In addition, we provide novel insights into the dual role of IFN signaling in MDSC's suppressive function and provide evidence that host-intrinsic IFN signaling may be critical for MDSC to gain suppressive function during tumor development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690372>Allergen : definition, indications, and reactions.</a></h2><p>Specific allergen  is the administration of increasing amounts of specific allergens to which the patient has type I immediate hypersensitivity.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of a multicentre cohort of patients with SIAC (n=195) were collected using tissue microarrays. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains for PD-L1, PD-1, and CD8 were performed, and microsatellite instability was evaluated using an IHC stain. Tumour microenvironment immune type (TMIT) I [PD-L1-positive tumour cells and CD8-high tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)] and TMIT III (PD-L1-positive tumour cells and CD8-low TILs) show the best and worse prognoses, respectively. PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with high microsatellite instability (MSI) status. CD8-high TILs were positively correlated with PD-1-high TILs and high MSI. The TMIT I subgroup demonstrated a more patent CD8/PD-L1/PD-1 signalling pathway compared to other TMITs. Therefore, the TMIT I subgroup can be expected to have an effective response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies in SIAC. Such classification of SIACs into four immune types can be useful in predicting the prognosis of patients and the identification of -responsive subgroups.Copyright © 2019 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia.

Intravenous (i.v.) injection of B16 melanoma cells (H-2K) leads to lethal disseminated pulmonary metastasis in Balb/c recipients (H-2K). This lack of immune control is related to low major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression on B16 cells which is associated with delayed and decreased anti-tumour adaptive immune responses (e.g., alloantibody formation) as: (i) other tumour types with normal H-2K expression are rejected with concomitant antibody production; (ii) preincubation of B16 with IFN-gamma to upregulate H-2K expression resulted in improved antibody production and anti-tumour activity. The delayed/decreased anti-tumour adaptive immune responses induced by B16 inoculation is not able to interrupt progression of primary metastases, while it is able to effectively eliminate secondary inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) B16 cells from progression. This is due to the presence of an immunosuppressive TME within the primary metastases characterized by increased regulatory T cells (Tregs) and an increased T helper cells (Th) 2/1 profile. These tumour-induced immunosuppressive T cell populations are counteracted by improved adaptive immunity via active and passive immunization, resulting in effective elimination of the TME, destruction of the metastatic tumour and a reversal of Th2/1 profile in a time-sensitive manner. Thus, we here demonstrate that the TME is not irreversible and adaptive immunity is able to eradicate established solid tumour and its immunosuppressive TME. This study will help design treatments to overcome the immunosuppressive effect of the TME and improve efficacy of cancer .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676387>Oncolytic Newcastle disease virus expressing a checkpoint inhibitor as a radioenhancing agent for murine melanoma.</a></h2><p>Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting negative regulators, or checkpoint molecules (e.g. PD1/PD-L1 & CTLA4), of anti-tumoural T cells have demonstrated clinical efficacy in treating several neoplastic diseases. While many patients enjoy remarkable responses to checkpoint inhibitors, a majority show adverse effects. Understanding how checkpoint inhibitors may augment established chemotherapy or radiotherapy regimens or other immunotherapies like oncolytic viruses may lead to better clinical outcomes measured by improved efficacy with reduced toxicity. Here, we assess how Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an oncolytic virus in clinical testing, may interact with radiotherapy to enhance checkpoint inhibitor blockade.An immunocompetent B16-F10 murine melanoma model, generally considered to be a poorly immunogenic or "cold" tumour, was utilised to query whether combining localised radiotherapy with NDV may be more effective than either therapy alone in controlling tumours in mice treated with anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies. We also investigated whether localised administration of a checkpoint inhibitor through an intratumoural injection of NDV that expresses anti-CTLA4 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) is comparable to systemic administration of anti-CTLA4 when combined with radiation in mediating its anti-tumour efficacy. Response rates were characterised by measuring tumour size over time, observation of complete tumour regression, and overall survival.Our results show that combining NDV plus radiotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors (PD1 or CTLA4 targeted mAbs) results in significantly better complete tumour regression rates with an abscopal effect in a murine model of melanoma than either single therapy combined with checkpoint inhibitors. Finally, we also show that localised administration of a recombinant NDV expressing anti-CTLA4 plus radiation is comparable to systemic anti-CTLA4 plus radiation in mediating its anti-tumour effect as assayed by survival benefit.Our results show that oncolytic NDV plus radiotherapy work together with checkpoint inhibitors to enhance tumour clearance of murine melanoma. NDV is an effective radiotherapy dose-sparing and immunotherapeutic agent capable of transgenic, in vivo expression of an anti-CTLA4 targeted scFv antibody with the potential to spare systemic exposure.The National Institutes of Health grant HHSN272201400008C supported the work.

However, as patient outcomes are heterogeneous, clinical tools to aid in prognostication are needed. The Lung Immune Prognostic Index (LIPI) correlates with outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with ICI, but its applicability beyond NSCLC is poorly defined. We sought to determine whether LIPI is associated with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) in a pooled, real-world, retrospective cohort of patients with solid tumors treated with ICI. Of the total pooled cohort (N = 578), 47.2%, 38.2% and 14.5% of patients were stratified into good, intermediate and poor LIPI group, respectively. Median OS were 22.8 (95% CI 17.4-29.5), 7.8 (95% CI 6.6-9.6), and 2.5 months (95% CI 1.4-3.4) (p < 0.0001). Median PFS were 9.9 (95% CI 7.2-11.5), 3.6 (95% CI 2.7-4.3), and 1.4 months (95% CI 1.2-2.2) (p < 0.0001). ORR was also associated with LIPI group (p < 0.001). Intermediate and poor LIPI were independently prognostic of OS compared to good LIPI, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.8 (95% CI 1.4-2.3, p < 0.001) and 3.6 (95% CI 2.5-5.1, p < 0.001), respectively.

Nevertheless, the efficacy of  in solid tumors still needs improvements due to the immunosuppressive properties of tumor cells and the microenvironment. To overcome these limitations, we prepared a novel tumor-targeting delivery system based on the underlying mechanism of immune-targeted cell death that encapsulated granzyme B protein within a porous polymeric nanocapsule. : A cell-penetrating peptide TAT was attached onto granzyme B (GrB) to enhance its transmembrane transport efficiency and potency to induce cell apoptosis. The endocytosis and internalization pathways of GrB-TAT (GrB-T) were analyzed in comparison with perforin by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the positively charged GrB-T was wrapped into nanoparticles by p-2-methacryloyloxy ethyl phosphorylcholine (PMPC)-modified HA (hyaluronic acid). The nanoparticles (called TCiGNPs) were characterized in terms of zeta potential and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The  anti-tumor effects of GrB-T were examined by cell apoptosis assay and Western blotting analysis. The  anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy of TCiGNPs was evaluated in a mouse tumor model. : The TAT peptide could play a role similar to perforin to mediate direct transmembrane transfer of GrB and improve GrB-induced cell apoptosis. The TCiGNPs were successfully synthesized and accumulated in the solid tumor through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. In the tumor microenvironment, TCiGNPs could be degraded by hyaluronidase and triggered the release of GrB-T. The TAT peptide enabled the translocation of GrB across the plasma membrane to induce tumor cell apoptosis  : We successfully developed a granzyme B delivery system with a GrB-T core and a PMPC/HA shell that simulated CTL/NK cell-mediated cancer  mechanism.

Apidae include the honeybee, bumblebee, and sweat bee, which are all docile and tend to sting mostly on provocation. The Africanized killer bee, a product of interbreeding between the domestic and African honeybee, is very aggressive and is mostly found in Mexico, Central America, Arizona, and California.

ICIs can produce durable antitumor responses but they are also associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Endocrinopathies have reported as one of the most common irAEs of ICIs.This study aimed to quantify association of endocrine adverse events (AEs) and ICI therapy and also to characterize the profiles of ICI-related endocrine complications from real-world practice. Data from the first quarter of 2014 to first quarter of 2019 in FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database were gathered to conduct disproportionality analysis. The definition of endocrine AEs relied on the preferred terms (PTs) provided by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Two signal indices based on statistical shrinkage transformation, reporting odds ratios (ROR) and information component (IC), were used to evaluate correlations between ICIs and endocrine events. For ROR, it was defined a signal if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (ROR) more than one, with at least 3 cases. For IC, lower end of the 95% confidence interval of IC (IC) exceeding zero was deemed statistically significant.A total of 29,294,336 records were involved, among these 6260 records related to endocrine AEs after ICIs treatment were identified. In general, male had a slightly lower reporting frequencies for ICIs-related endocrinopathies compared with female but not significant (ROR = 0.98 95%CI: 0.93-1.04) and the difference varied in several common endocrine AEs. Notably, in general, ICI drugs were significantly associated with over-reporting frequencies of endocrine complications, corresponding to IC = 2.49 and ROR = 5.99. For monotherapy, three strategies (anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4) were all associated with significant increasing endocrine events. Different reporting frequencies emerged when anti-CTLA-4 therapy was compared with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 medications for endocrine toxicities, corresponding to ROR = 1.68 (95%CI 1.55-1.83), ROR = 2.54 (95%CI 2.20-2.93), respectively. Combination therapy was associated with higher risk of endocrinopathies compared with monotherapy (ROR = 2.00, 95%CI 1.89-2.11). When further analysis, the spectrum of endocrine AEs differed in  regimens. Hypothyroidism (N = 885,14.14%), adrenal insufficiency(N = 730,11.66%), hypophysitis (N = 688,10.99%) and hyperthyroidism (N = 472,7.54%) were top 4 ranked endocrine events after ICI therapy and their reporting frequency also differed in ICI immunotherapies.Our pharmacovigilance analysis shows a high reporting frequency of endocrine AEs provoked by ICI monotherapy (especially anti-CTLA-4 therapy) and further reinforced by combination therapy. In addition, treatment with different ICI immunotherapies may result in a unique and distinct profile of endocrinopathies. Early recognition and management of ICI-related endocrine irAEs is of vital importance in clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695425>An Immunoscore System Based On CD3 And CD8 Infiltrating Lymphocytes Densities To Predict The Outcome Of Patients With Colorectal Adenocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the Immunoscore (IS) methodology as a prognostic marker of colorectal adenocarcinoma in Tunisian population. Tumor blocks were retrospectively collected from 106 patients with sporadic colorectal cancer.Immunohistochemical staining and images analysis software were used to quantify the density of CD3 and CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the center of the tumor and invasive margin.The density of CD3 and CD8 was significantly associated with 5-year overall survival (=0.001 and =0.00098, respectively) and 5-year disease-free survival (=0.0006 and =0.0056, respectively). The earlier stage and the absence of vascular emboli showed a significant association with IS analysis. Cox multivariate regression analysis revealed that Immunoscore (from I0 to I4) was more significantly correlated with overall survival (=0.00011) and disease-free survival (=0.0008) than Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging (=0.057 and =0.039, respectively). Patients with low IS were associated with inferior disease-free survival and overall survival, contrary to patients with high IS.This is the first study which evaluated the prognostic value of IS methodology in colorectal cancer in African and Arabic population. The IS methodology carries out in this study allows to estimate the risk of relapse in patients with colorectal cancer.

In the present study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the landscape of tumor fusion neoantigens in cancer and proposed a score scheme to quantitatively assess their immunogenic potentials. By analyzing three large-scale tumor datasets, we demonstrated that (1) the tumor fusion candidate neoantigen burden is not related to the  outcome; (2) fusion neoantigens tend to have notably higher immunogenic potentials than SNV&indel-based candidate neoantigens, making them better candidates for cancer vaccines; (3) fusion candidate neoantigens distribute sparsely between individual patients. Although several recurrent candidate neoantigens exist, they usually have extremely low immunogenic potentials, suggesting that vaccination-based cancer  must be personalized; (4) compared with fusion mutations involving tumor passenger genes, fusion mutations involving oncogenic genes have remarkably low immunogenic potentials, indicating that they undergo selection pressure during tumorigenesis.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Patients are at risk for both local and distant disease relapse after primary surgery. However, there may be a window of opportunity for surgery, if mediastinal downstaging has been obtained after induction therapy. This manuscript reviews the outcome of patients treated by neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NA-C) followed by surgery, compared with patients treated with definitive sequential or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT), illustrated by a single-centre retrospective case series.Of 53 eligible patients, 19 received NA-C and underwent surgical resection, whilst 20 and 14 received concurrent or sequential definitive CRT, respectively. A significant difference in progression-free survival favouring NA-C followed by surgery over both CRT modalities was found. However, this translated only in an overall survival benefit in comparison with sequential definitive CRT. A trend for better outcome was observed in selected surgical patients with single-level mediastinal involvement and complete resection.Our case series results are consistent with the present standard of care of CRT, and restrict surgical resection to carefully selected patients.  will likely change the treatment paradigm.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695800>Theranostics in immuno-oncology using nanobody derivatives.</a></h2><p>Targeted therapy and  have become mainstream in cancer treatment.

A growing modality in precision oncology is the development of theranostics, as this enables patient selection, treatment and monitoring. In this approach, labeled compounds and an imaging technology are used to diagnose patients and select the best treatment option, whereas for therapy, related compounds are used to target cancer cells or the tumor stroma. In this context, nanobodies and nanobody-directed therapeutics have gained interest. This interest stems from their high antigen specificity, small size, ease of labeling and engineering, allowing specific imaging and design of therapies targeting antigens on tumor cells, immune cells as well as proteins in the tumor environment.

Quality evaluation of included studies was performed, and meta-analyses with regards to overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were conducted using RevMan 5.3 and STATA 11.A total of 12 eligible studies with 1340 cancer patients were included. Combined results showed that elevated PLR was a negative factor affecting the efficacy of ICIs in cancer patients. Patients with high PLR had a significantly shorter OS compared to those with low PLR (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.46 to 2.80, P < 0.0001), as well as PFS (HR = 1.74, 95%CI: 1.27 to 2.38, P = 0.0006).

Surgery is currently the optimal treatment for early-stage NSCLC, however, the postoperative recurrence rate is relatively high and the long-term survival of these patients is still a problem to be overcomed. Previous studies have shown that early-stage NSCLC patients may benefit from preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy when compared to surgery alone, although the benefit is only moderate.

Among them, the most common disorders are Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and some forms of familial parkinsonism. Both α-syn fibrils and oligomers have been found to exert toxic effects on neurons or oligodendroglial cells, can activate neuroinflammatory responses, and mediate the spreading of α-syn pathology. This poses the question of which is the most toxic α-syn species. What is worst, α-syn appears as a very peculiar protein, exerting multiple physiological functions in neurons, especially at synapses, but without acquiring a stable tertiary structure. Its conformation is particularly plastic, and the protein can exist in a natively unfolded state (mainly in solution), partially α-helical folded state (when it interacts with biological membranes), or oligomeric state (tetramers or dimers with debated functional profile). The extent of α-syn expression impinges on the resilience of neuronal cells, as multiplications of its gene locus, or overexpression, can cause neurodegeneration and onset of motor phenotype. For these reasons, one of the main challenges in the field of synucleinopathies, which still nowadays can only be managed by symptomatic therapies, has been the development of strategies aimed at reducing α-syn levels, oligomer formation, fibrillation, or cell-to-cell transmission. This review resumes the therapeutic approaches that have been proposed or are under development to counteract α-syn pathology by direct targeting of this protein and discuss their pros and cons in relation to the current state-of-the-art α-syn biology.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686845>Lenvatinib combined nivolumab injection followed by extended right hepatectomy is a feasible treatment for patients with massive hepatocellular carcinoma: a case report.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive malignant tumor.

Conventional treatment options include postoperative (adjuvant) and preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although these treatment modalities have shown to decrease tumor burden, a major limitation to chemothearpy/radiotherapy is the high recurrence rate in patients. Immune-modulation strategies have emerged as a promising new therapeutic avenue to reduce this recurrence rate while minimizing undesirable systemic side effects. This review will focus specifically on the mechanisms of monoclonal antibodies: immune checkpoint inhibitors and cytokines, as well as current drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and new clinical/pre-clinical trials. Finally, this review will investigate emerging methods used to monitor tumor response post-treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although a subset of patients is able to achieve durable responses, the majority experience eventual disease progression on existing therapies. Trials evaluating novel combinatorial strategies, checkpoint inhibitors, immune agonists, T cell-based therapies, intratumoral agents, and others are ongoing. While strides have been made in the treatment of advanced melanoma, further research is needed to identify alternative immune and molecular targets in order to overcome resistance and achieve better clinical outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695152>A CD133-AKT-Wnt signaling axis drives glioblastoma brain tumor-initiating cells.</a></h2><p>Mechanistic insight into signaling pathways downstream of surface receptors has been revolutionized with integrated cancer genomics. This has fostered current treatment modalities, namely , to capitalize on targeting key oncogenic signaling nodes downstream of a limited number of surface markers. Unfortunately, rudimentary mechanistic understanding of most other cell surface proteins has reduced the clinical utility of these markers. CD133 has reproducibly been shown to correlate with disease progression, recurrence, and poor overall survivorship in the malignant adult brain tumor, glioblastoma (GBM). Using several patient-derived CD133 and CD133 GBMs we describe intrinsic differences in determinants of stemness, which we owe to a CD133-AKT-Wnt signaling axis in which CD133 functions as a putative cell surface receptor for AKT-dependent Wnt activation. These findings may have implications for personalized oncology trials targeting PI3K/AKT or Wnt as both pathways may be activated independent of their canonical drivers, leading to treatment resistance and disease relapse.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676746>Skin Prick Testing to Identify Food Allergens in 8393 Children and Adolescents with Asthma in Chongqing, Southwest China.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND The prevalence of food allergies in asthmatic children and adolescents has significantly increased over recent years. Nevertheless, the relevant clinical analyses are still lacking in China. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine common food allergens in pediatric patients with asthma in Chongqing, Southwest China. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 8393 asthmatic patients from Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (CHCMU) were enrolled in this retrospective study between October 2014 and July 2017. All patients underwent skin prick test (SPT) with 10 food allergens and recorded history of clinical reactivity. The correlations among the positive rates, categories of allergens, gender, age, and living environment were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 2544 patients (30.31%) had a positive SPT, while the prevalence of food allergy was 8%. Sea crab, peanut, and sea shrimp were the most common food allergens found in the studied population. The frequent food allergies were sea crab, peanuts, and sea shrimp.

Epidemiological studies have highlighted that exposure to antibiotic therapy influences the probability of response to ICPI and predict for shorter patient survival across malignancies. Whilst a number of studies have reproducibly documented the detrimental effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics, the immune-biologic mechanisms underlying the association with outcome are poorly understood. Perturbation of the gut microbiota, an increasingly well-characterized factor capable of influencing ICPI-mediated immune reconstitution, has been indicated as a putative mechanism to explain the adverse effects attributed to antibiotic exposure in the context of ICPI therapy. Prospective studies are required to validate antibiotic-mediated gut perturbations as a mechanism of ICPI refractoriness and guide the development of strategies to overcome this barrier to an effective delivery of anti-cancer .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691903>Functions of p53 in pluripotent stem cells.</a></h2><p>Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are capable of unlimited self-renewal in culture and differentiation into all functional cell types in the body, and thus hold great promise for regenerative medicine. To achieve their clinical potential, it is critical for PSCs to maintain genomic stability during the extended proliferation. The critical tumor suppressor p53 is required to maintain genomic stability of mammalian cells. In response to DNA damage or oncogenic stress, p53 plays multiple roles in maintaining genomic stability of somatic cells by inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence to prevent the passage of genetic mutations to the daughter cells. p53 is also required to maintain the genomic stability of PSCs. However, in response to the genotoxic stresses, a primary role of p53 in PSCs is to induce the differentiation of PSCs and inhibit pluripotency, providing mechanisms to maintain the genomic stability of the self-renewing PSCs. In addition, the roles of p53 in cellular metabolism might also contribute to genomic stability of PSCs by limiting oxidative stress. In summary, the elucidation of the roles of p53 in PSCs will be a prerequisite for developing safe PSC-based cell therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690374>Allergic and nonallergic rhinitis.</a></h2><p>Rhinitis is characterized by nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and/or posterior nasal drainage. It affects a significant portion of the population and presents a large burden economically and on quality of life. Rhinitis is broadly characterized as allergic and nonallergic, of which nonallergic rhinitis may be divided into inflammatory and noninflammatory etiologies. The inflammatory causes include nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia, postinfectious, and rhinitis associated with nasal polyps. The noninflammatory causes include idiopathic nonallergic (vasomotor) rhinitis, medication-induced rhinitis, hormone related (e.g., pregnancy), and systemic disease related. Allergic rhinitis is classified as intermittent or persistent and mild versus moderate-severe. The nasal mucosa is extremely vascular; parasympathetic stimulation promotes an increase in nasal cavity resistance and nasal gland secretion, whereas sympathetic stimulation leads to vasoconstriction. The diagnosis of rhinitis begins with a directed history, particularly noting pattern, chronicity, and triggers of symptoms. Examination of the nasal cavity with attention to appearance of the septum and inferior turbinates is recommended. Skin testing for aeroallergens is helpful in demonstrating the presence or absence of immunoglobulin E antibodies and to differentiate nonallergic from allergic rhinitis. Treatment includes patient education, irritant or allergen avoidance, and pharmacotherapy. Medications used for the treatment of rhinitis include intranasal corticosteroids, oral and intranasal antihistamines, intranasal anticholinergic agents, oral decongestants, and leukotriene receptor antagonists. When used in combination, an intranasal antihistamine spray and nasal steroid provide greater symptomatic relief than monotherapy. Allergen  is the only disease-modifying intervention available for allergic rhinitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693899>Hepatocytes Delete Regulatory T Cells by Enclysis, a CD4 T Cell Engulfment Process.</a></h2><p>CD4 T cells play critical roles in directing immunity, both as T helper and as regulatory T (Treg) cells. Here, we demonstrate that hepatocytes can modulate T cell populations through engulfment of live CD4 lymphocytes. We term this phenomenon enclysis to reflect the specific enclosure of CD4 T cells in hepatocytes. Enclysis is selective for CD4 but not CD8 cells, independent of antigen-specific activation, and occurs in human hepatocytes in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) facilitates T cell early adhesion and internalization, whereas hepatocytes form membrane lamellipodia or blebs to mediate engulfment. T cell internalization is unaffected by wortmannin and Rho kinase inhibition. Hepatocytes engulf Treg cells more efficiently than non-Treg cells, but Treg cell-containing vesicles preferentially acidify overnight. Thus, enclysis is a biological process with potential effects on immunomodulation and opens a new field for research to fully understand CD4 T cell dynamics in liver inflammation.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Molecular imaging modalities such as MRI and PET can be used to track and monitor TAM dynamics in tumors non-invasively, based on specific uptake and quantification of MRI-detectable nanoparticles or PET-detectable radiotracers. Particular molecular signatures can be leveraged to target anti-inflammatory TAM, which support tumor growth, and pro-inflammatory TAM, which suppress tumor growth. In addition, TAM-directed imaging probes can be designed to include immune modulating properties, thereby leading to combined diagnostic and therapeutic (theranostic) effects. In this review, we will discuss the complementary role of TAM-directed radiotracers and iron oxide nanoparticles for monitoring cancer immunotherapies with PET and MRI technologies. In addition, we will outline how TAM-directed imaging and therapy is interdependent and can be connected towards improved clinical outcomes.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677920>The B7x Immune Checkpoint Pathway: From Discovery to Clinical Trial.</a></h2><p>B7x (B7 homolog x, also known as B7-H4, B7S1, and VTCN1) was discovered by ourselves and others in 2003 as the seventh member of the B7 family. It is an inhibitory immune checkpoint of great significance to human disease. Tissue-expressed B7x minimizes autoimmune and inflammatory responses. It is overexpressed in a broad spectrum of human cancers, where it suppresses antitumor immunity. Further, B7x and PD-L1 tend to have mutually exclusive expression in cancer cells. Therapeutics targeting B7x are effective in animal models of cancers and autoimmune disorders, and early-phase clinical trials are underway to determine the efficacy and safety of targeting B7x in human diseases. It took 15 years moving from the discovery of B7x to clinical trials. Further studies will be necessary to identify its receptors, reveal its physiological functions in organs, and combine therapies targeting B7x with other treatments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Neu5Gc synthesis starts from the N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) precursor modified by an hydroxylic group addition catalyzed by CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase enzyme (CMAH). In humans, CMAH was inactivated by a 92 bp deletion occurred 2-3 million years ago. Few other mammals do not synthetize Neu5Gc, however livestock species used for food production and as a source of biological materials for medical applications carry Neu5Gc. Trace amounts of Neu5Gc are up taken through the diet and incorporated into various tissues including epithelia and endothelia cells. Humans carry "natural," diet-induced Anti-Neu5Gc antibodies and when undertaking medical treatments or receiving transplants or devices that contain animal derived products they can cause immunological reaction affecting pharmacology, immune tolerance, and severe side effect like serum sickness disease (SSD). Neu5Gc null mice have been the main experimental model to study such phenotype. With the recent advances in genome editing, pigs and cattle KO for Neu5Gc have been generated always in association with the αGal KO. These large animals are normal and fertile and provide additional experimental models to study such mutation. Moreover, they will be the base for the development of new therapeutic applications like polyclonal IgG , Bioprosthetic Heart Valves, cells and tissues replacement.Copyright © 2019 Perota and Galli.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677539>Can Bioactive Lipid(s) Augment Anti-cancer Action of  and Prevent Cytokine Storm?</a></h2><p>It is desired to selectively kill tumor cells with little or no action on normal cells. Current treatment options are associated with significant side effects including therapy with immune check point inhibitors (ICI). ICI therapy induced side effects are due to excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). At the same time, production of appropriate amounts of IL-6 and TNF-α are needed to eliminate tumor cells. Hence, methods are needed that can selectively eliminate tumor cells and tone down the side effects of cytokine storm. Studies showed that IL-6 and TNF-α activate phospholipases to induce the release of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from the cell membrane phospholipid pool. PUFAs form precursors to pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids and are capable of suppressing IL-6 and TNF-α excess production. PUFAs are endowed with capacity to selectively kill tumor cells by augmenting free radical generation and accumulation of toxic lipid peroxides in tumor but not normal cells. NK cells, TILs (tumor infiltrating cells) and γδ T cells release toxic granules (also called as cytolytic granules) that contain unsaturated fatty acids localized between the granule delimiting membrane and the granule core. Thus, lipids are a universal component of cytolytic granules and play an important role in their cytotoxic actions. Based on this evidence, it is suggested that a combination of ICI/TILs and PUFAs may form a novel method of eliminating cancer with few side effects.Copyright © 2019 IMSS. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Unlike the direct therapeutic targeting of tumor cells, cancer  is a new strategy that boosts the host's immune system to detect specific cancer cells for efficient elimination. Nanoparticles incorporating immunomodulatory agents can activate immune cells and modulate the tumor microenvironment to enhance antitumor immunity. Such nanoparticle-based cancer immunotherapies have received considerable attention and have been extensively studied in recent years. This review thus focuses on nanoparticle-based platforms (especially naturally derived nanoparticles and synthetic nanoparticles) utilized in recent advances; summarizes delivery systems that incorporate various immune-modulating agents, including peptides and nucleic acids, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and other small immunostimulating agents; and introduces combinational cancer  with nanoparticles, especially nanoparticle-based photo- and nanoparticle-based chemo-. Undoubtedly, the recent studies introduced in this review prove that nanoparticle-incorporated cancer  is a highly promising treatment modality for patients with cancer.

The highly porous framework of UPMSNP provides a large capacity for aPD-L1. Fer capping of the pores extends the period of aPD-L1 release and provides MR visibility of the aPD-L1 loaded UPMSNP. As-chosen Cbz chemotherapy prior to the local  induces strong immunogenic cell death, dendritic cell maturation, and upregulation of PD-L1 of tumor cells. Finally, tumor growth inhibition of sequential MR image-guided local delivery of Fer-ICB-UPMSNPs and a tumor specific adoptive immune reaction are demonstrated in the pretreated Tramp C1 PC mouse model with Cbz chemotherapy. The tumor suppression is superior to those obtained with systemic ICB treatment after Cbz, only Fer-ICB-UPMSNP or only Cbz.

The limited therapeutic options for muscle-invasive and advanced/metastatic urothelial cancer are one of the major unmet needs for patients with this neoplasm, in Italy and worldwide. Advances in cancer  and in understanding molecular biology of bladder cancer are, however, rapidly altering the therapeutic landscape for targeted subgroups of patients with advanced/metastatic disease.

C-HBV targets the host immune system through specific receptors present on dendritic cells (DCs) which facilitates antigen internalization, processing and presentation on MHC class I and II to induce both cellular and humoral immune responses against HBV antigens. T cell responses, previously assessed by  antigen presentation assays using human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived DCs and T cells from uninfected and HBV chronic infected donors, demonstrated that C-HBV was highly immunogenic. A vaccine dose response study was performed in sheep to analyze the immunogenicity of C-HBV . Sheep (n = 8/group) received three consecutive subcutaneous injections of each dose of C-HBV at four-week intervals. Analysis of serum antibody levels confirmed C-HBV induced a dose-dependent antibody response to C-HBV and S1/S2-Core. Kinetics of the S1/S2-Core specific antibody response was similar to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-specific antibody responses induced by ENGERIX-B. Analysis of cell-mediated immune responses (CMI) confirmed C-HBV induced both dose-dependent S1/S2-Core-specific lymphocyte proliferative responses and IFN-γ secretion. These responses were stronger with blood lymphocytes than with cells isolated from the lymph node draining the vaccination site. No correlation was seen between antibody titres and CMI.

Here, a red blood cell membrane (mRBC)-camouflaged hollow MnO (HMnO ) catalytic nanosystem embedded with lactate oxidase (LOX) and a glycolysis inhibitor (denoted as PMLR) is constructed for intra/extracellular lactic acid exhaustion as well as synergistic metabolic therapy and  of tumor. Benefiting from the long-circulation property of the mRBC, the nanosystem can gradually accumulate in a tumor site through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The extracellular nanosystem consumes lactic acid in the TME by catalyzing its oxidation reaction via LOX. Meanwhile, the intracellular nanosystem releases the glycolysis inhibitor to cut off the source of lactic acid, as well as achieve antitumor metabolic therapy through the blockade of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) supply. Both the extracellular and intracellular processes can be sensitized by O , which can be produced during the decomposition of endogenous H O catalyzed by the PMLR nanosystem. The results show that the PMLR nanosystem can ceaselessly remove lactic acid, and then lead to an immunocompetent TME.

Unfortunately, not all patients respond to therapy while severe immune-related adverse effects are prevalent. Currently, patient stratification is based on  marker expression through immunohistochemical analysis on biopsied material. However, expression can be heterogeneous within and between tumor lesions, amplifying the sampling limitations of biopsies. Analysis of  target expression by non-invasive quantitative molecular imaging with PET or SPECT may overcome this issue. In this review, an overview of tracers that have been developed for preclinical and clinical imaging of key  targets, such as programmed cell death-1, programmed cell death ligand-1, IDO1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 is presented.

Although primary GBM patients receive extensive therapies, tumors may recur within months, and there is no objective and scientific method to predict prognosis. Adoptive  holds great promise for GBM treatment. However, the expression profiles of the tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and tumor immune microenvironment (TME) genes used in  of GBM patients have not been fully described. The present study aimed to develop a predictive tool to evaluate patient survival based on full analysis of the expression levels of TAAs and TME genes.Expression profiles of a panel of 87 TAAs and 8 TME genes significantly correlated with poor prognosis were evaluated in 44 GBM patients and 10 normal brain tissues using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A linear formula (the LASSO algorithm based in the R package) weighted by regression coefficients was used to develop a multi-element expression score to predict prognosis; this formula was cross-validated by the leave-one-out method in different GBM cohorts.After analysis of gene expression, clinical features, and overall survival (OS), a total of 8 TAAs (CHI3L1, EZH2, TRIOBP, PCNA, PIK3R1, PRKDC, SART3 and EPCAM), 1 TME gene (FOXP3) and 4 clinical features (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR), number of basophils (BAS), age and treatment with standard radiotherapy and chemotherapy) were included in the formula. There were significant differences between high and low scoring groups identified using the formula in different GBM cohorts (TCGA (n=732) and GEO databases (n=84)), implying poor and good prognosis, respectively.The multi-element expression score was significantly associated with OS of GBM patients.

Here, we designed a biomaterials-based strategy for converting tumor-derived antigenic microparticles (T-MPs) into a cancer vaccine to meet this conundrum and demonstrated its therapeutic potential in multiple murine tumor models. The internal cavity of T-MPs was employed to store nano-Fe3O4 (Fe3O4/T-MPs) and then dense adjuvant CpG-loaded liposome arrays (CpG/Lipo) were tethered on the surface of Fe3O4/T-MP through mild surface engineering to get a vaccine (Fe3O4/T-MPs-CpG/Lipo), demonstrating that co-delivery of Fe3O4/T-MPs and CpG/Lipo to antigen presenting cells (APCs) could elicit strong tumor antigen-specific host immune response. Meanwhile, vaccines distributed in TME could reverse infiltrated tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) into a tumor-suppressive M1 phenotype by nano-Fe3O4, amazingly induce abundant infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and transform "cold" tumor into "hot" tumor. Furthermore, amplified antitumor immunity was realized by the combination of Fe3O4/T-MPs-CpG/Lipo vaccine and immune checkpoint PD-L1 blockade, specifically inhibiting ∼83% progression of B16F10-bearing mice and extending the median survival time to 3 months. Overall, this study synergistically modulates tumor immunosuppressive network and host antitumor immunity in a spatiotemporal manner, which suggests a general cell-engineering strategy tailored to personalized vaccine from autologous cancer cell materials of each individual patient.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683225>Gene signatures of tumor inflammation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) predict responses to immune checkpoint blockade in lung cancer with high accuracy.</a></h2><p>Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has resulted in striking clinical responses, but only in a subset of patients. The goal of this study was to evaluate transcriptional signatures previously reported in the literature in an independent cohort of NSCLC patients receiving ICB.This retrospective study analyzed transcriptional profiles from pre-treatment tumor samples of 52 chemotherapy-refractory advanced NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy. Gene signatures based on published reports were created and examined for their association with response to therapy and progression-free and overall survival (PFS, OS).Two signatures predicting response and outcomes were identified. One reflected the degree of immune infiltration and upregulation of interferon-gamma-induced genes. A second reflected the EMT status. Compared to those not responding to therapy, patients whose tumors responded to ICB had higher scores in an inflammatory gene signature (6.0 ± 2.9 vs -5.5 ± 3.4, p = 0.014) or a more epithelial phenotype (-1.7 ± 1.0 vs 2.1 ± 1.2, p = 0.016). Both signatures demonstrated a satisfactory predictive accuracy for response: AUC of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.84) for the inflammatory and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.85) for EMT signatures, respectively. A weighted score combining EMT and inflammatory signatures showed increased predictive value with AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.99). Kaplan-Meier curves for patients above and below the median combined score showed a significant separation for PFS and OS (all p < 0.01, log rank test).The EMT/Inflammation signature score may be useful in directing checkpoint inhibitor therapy in lung cancer and suggests that reversal of EMT might augment efficacy of ICB.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Increasing evidence suggests that the therapeutic efficacy of these tumor antigen-targeting mAbs is mediated - at least partially - by myeloid effector cells, which are controlled by the innate immune checkpoint interaction between CD47 and SIRPα. We and others have previously demonstrated that inhibiting CD47-SIRPα interactions can substantially potentiate antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and cytotoxicity (ADCC) of tumor cells by IgG antibodies both in vivo and in vitro. IgA antibodies are superior in killing cancer cells by neutrophils compared to IgG antibodies with the same variable regions, but the impact of CD47-SIRPα on IgA-mediated killing has not been investigated. Here, we show that checkpoint inhibition of CD47-SIRPα interactions further enhances destruction of IgA antibody-opsonized cancer cells by human neutrophils. This was shown for multiple tumor types and IgA antibodies against different antigens, i.e. HER2/neu and EGFR. Consequently, combining IgA antibodies against HER2/neu or EGFR with SIRPα inhibition proved to be effective in eradicating cancer cells in vivo. In a syngeneic in vivo model, the eradication of cancer cells was predominantly mediated by granulocytes, which were actively recruited to the tumor site by SIRPα blockade. We conclude that IgA-mediated tumor cell destruction can be further enhanced by CD47-SIRPα checkpoint inhibition. These findings provide a basis for targeting CD47-SIRPα interactions in combination with IgA therapeutic antibodies to improve their potential clinical efficacy in tumor patients.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696204>CXCR3 from chemokine receptor family correlates with immune infiltration and predicts poor survival in osteosarcoma.</a></h2><p>Chemokine receptors have a crucial role in regulating tumor mediating immunity and also implicated in the prognosis of some cancers. Here, the association between CXC chemokine receptors (CXCR2-5) and prognosis in osteosarcoma was studied.Differences between CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, and CXCR5 expression and overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses. The associations of CXCR3 expression with clinical features and the prognosis were also analyzed. The signaling pathways modulated by CXCR3 were investigated. The correlations between CXCR3 and immune infiltrates were investigated.The expression of CXCR2, CXCR4, and CXCR5 was not associated with the prognosis, but CXCR3 low expression was correlated with worse OS and EFS of osteosarcoma, especially for female, patients aged less than 15.1 years, or patients without metastasis. Low CXCR3 expression was related to tumor site and histologic response (P&lt;0.05), but not associated with other clinical characteristics. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that CXCR3 remained independently associated with the prognosis, especially for OS (HR = 3.26, 95% CI = 1.15-9.24, P = 0.026). The cell adhesion, apoptosis, metabolism, KRAS, P53, NOTCH, reactive oxygen species (ROS), PI3K/Akt/mTOR, VEGF, inflammation, and immune-related pathways such as IL-6/JAK/STAT3, TNF-α via NF-κB, Toll/NOD-like receptor, and complement were modulated by CXCR3. CXCR3 expression showed an especially positive correlation with immune infiltration of T cells CD8, macrophages M1, plasma cells, and NK cells activated.CXCR3 may be an independent risk factor for the prognosis and was most likely to benefit from  in osteosarcoma.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689443>HLA DR2b-binding peptides from human endogenous retrovirus envelope, Epstein-Barr virus and brain proteins in the context of molecular mimicry in multiple sclerosis.</a></h2><p>The aetiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) is as yet poorly understood. Multiple mechanisms in different disease stages are responsible for immunopathology in MS. HLA Class II DR2b (DRB1*1501 β, DRA1*0101 α) is the strongest genetic risk factor for MS. Remnants of ancient retroviruses in the human genome, termed human endogenous retroviruses (HERV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection are also associated with MS. In silico analyses of human endogenous retroviral envelope (HERV env) proteins and three myelin proteins that are principal targets of an autoimmune response in MS showed sequence similarities between potential T epitopes within pairs of viral and myelin peptides predicted to bind HLA DR2b. This led to the proposal that such molecular mimicry may potentially trigger MS. HLA DR2b binding characteristics of previously identified peptides from the three myelin proteins and HERV env proteins as well as additional in silico predicted peptides from other encephalitogenic brain proteins and EBV proteins were studied to further investigate molecular mimicry. Peptides containing potential T epitopes from the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and HERV env previously predicted to bind HLA DR2b as well as other pertinent potential HLA DR2b-restricted T epitopes were confirmed to bind HLA DR2b molecules. Molecular modelling of HLA DR2b in complex with high affinity peptides derived from MOG and HERV env proteins showed that their binding could occur in a similar manner to a HLA DR2b-binding peptide containing a known T epitope. A structurally related pair of peptides predicted to bind HLA DR2b from the EBV protein EBNA1 and β synuclein, a brain protein implicated in MS, were also shown to similarly bind HLA DR2b. The findings justify investigating CD4 + T cell responses to the identified peptides.Copyright © 2019.

This syndrome is well documented and characterized by attenuated function of innate and adaptive immune cells. Several pharmacological interventions aimed to restore the immune response are emerging of which interferon-gamma (IFNγ) is one. It is of paramount relevance to obtain clinical information on optimal timing of the IFNγ-treatment, -tolerance, -effectiveness and outcome before performing a RCT. We describe the effects of IFNγ in a cohort of 18 adult and 2 pediatric sepsis patients.In this open-label prospective multi-center case-series, IFNγ treatment was initiated in patients selected on clinical and immunological criteria early (< 4 days) or late (> 7 days) following the onset of sepsis.

These have led to the development of important methods for cancer therapy including virotherapy, , chemotherapy, targeted drug therapy, and many others. Along with this, there have also been some developments on analytical and computational models to help provide insights into clinical observations. This work develops a new mathematical model that combines important interactions between tumor cells and cells in the immune systems including natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and cytotoxic CD8 T cells combined with drug delivery to these cell sites. These interactions are described via a system of ordinary differential equations that are solved numerically. A stability analysis of this model is also performed to determine conditions for tumor-free equilibrium to be stable. We also study the influence of proliferation rates and drug interventions in the dynamics of all the cells involved. Another contribution is the development of a novel parameter estimation methodology to determine optimal parameters in the model that can reproduce a given dataset. Our results seem to suggest that the model employed is a robust candidate for studying the dynamics of tumor cells and it helps to provide the dynamic interactions between the tumor cells, immune system, and drug-response systems.Copyright © 2019 Pranav Unni and Padmanabhan Seshaiyer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681619>Possible Abscopal Effect Observed in Frontal Meningioma After Localized IMRT on Posterior Meningioma Resection Cavity Without Adjuvant .</a></h2><p> Localized radiation therapy (RT) is known to infrequently cause off-target or "abscopal" effects at distant metastatic lesions. The mechanism through which abscopal effects occur remains unknown, but is thought to be caused by a humoral immune response to tumor-specific antigens generated by RT. Combination treatment regimens involving RT and  to boost the humoral immune response have demonstrated synergistic effects in promoting and accelerating abscopal effects in metastatic cancer. Nevertheless, abscopal effects, particularly after RT alone, remain exceedingly rare.  We report the case of an 84-year-old man with an atypical meningioma, who demonstrated a radiographically significant response to an untreated second intracranial lesion, likely also a meningioma, after intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to a separate, detatched resection cavity. Serial annual MRI imaging starting at 2- to 3.5-year (most recent) post-IMRT follow-up demonstrated a persistent decrease in both tumor size and surrounding edema in the untreated second lesion, suggestive of a possible abscopal effect.

Molecular targeted agents were developed during the 10-year period from 2007 to 2016, but every test of these agents from phase II or phase III clinical trial failed due to a low response rate and high toxicity.

As recommended by updated Barcelona Clinical Liver cancer (BCLC) treatment algorithms, lenvatinib is now feasible as an alternative to sorafenib as a first-line treatment for advanced HCC. Regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab are appropriate supplements for sorafenib as second-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC who are resistant, show progression or do not tolerate sorafenib.

Granulocytic MDSC (G-MDSC) were defined as CD11b+CD14-CD15+ and monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC) were defined as CD11b+CD14+HLA-DRlow/-.MDSC infiltration occurred in approximately one-third (35.5%) of CTCL lesions, with a predilection for non-MF lesions (p < 0.05). The predominant morphology of MDSC was granulocytic. Although in MF lesions the presence of MDSC infiltrates did not correlate with clinical stage, it conferred significantly worse overall survival outcomes (p < 0.05).

Thus, efforts continue in the search for novel  strategies, being one of the most promising the use of peptides derived from major allergens. This work tries to determine the therapeutic potential and safety of 5 dodecapeptides derived from the main allergen of olive-pollen allergy, Ole e 1. The immunomodulatory capacity of these peptides was studied using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from 19 olive-pollen-allergic patients and 10 healthy controls. We determined the capacity of these peptides to inhibit the proliferative response toward olive-pollen allergenic extract and to induce the regulatory cytokines, IL-10 and IL-35. To test the safety and absence of allergenicity of the peptides, the basophil activation was analyzed by flow-cytometry, using peripheral blood. The results showed that two of five peptides inhibited near to 30% the proliferative response against the total olive-pollen allergenic extract in olive-pollen-allergic patients. Inhibition increased to nearly 35% when the 5 peptides were used in combination. In both cases, a statistically significant induction of IL-10 and IL-35 secretion was observed in the supernatants of allergic patients PBMCs cultures.

Our data demonstrated that inhibition of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) function with TIMO could overcome MDSCs-mediated immunosuppression and promote antigen-specific T-lymphocyte responses, resulting in the restoration of cytotoxic T cell-mediated tumor control. We further demonstrated that TIMO and anti-PD1 combination therapy promoted tumor growth control in a syngeneic ovarian tumor model. Our results provided proof of concept for a new combination strategy involving the use of a selective inhibitor of PI3Kδ/γ to inhibit the function of MDSCs to enhance tumor responses to immune checkpoint blocking antibodies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696981>Massively Evoking Immunogenic Cell Death by Focused Mitochondrial Oxidative Stress using an AIE Luminogen with a Twisted Molecular Structure.</a></h2><p>Immunogenic cell death (ICD) provides momentous theoretical principle for modern cancer . However, the currently available ICD inducers are still very limited and photosensitizer-based ones can hardly induce sufficient ICD to achieve satisfactory cancer  by themselves. Herein, an organic photosensitizer (named TPE-DPA-TCyP) with a twisted molecular structure, strong aggregation-induced emission activity, and specific ability is reported for effectively inducing focused mitochondrial oxidative stress of cancer cells, which can serve as a much superior ICD inducer to the popularly used ones, including chlorin e6 (Ce6), pheophorbide A, and oxaliplatin. Furthermore, more effective in vivo ICD immunogenicity of TPE-DPA-TCyP than Ce6 is also demonstrated using a prophylactic tumor vaccination model. The underlying mechanism of the effectiveness and robustness of TPE-DPA-TCyP in inducing antitumor immunity and immune-memory effect in vivo is verified by immune cell analyses. This study thus reveals that inducing focused mitochondrial oxidative stress is a highly effective strategy to evoke abundant and large-scale ICD.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy was allowed. Monotherapy and combination dose-escalation cohorts ran concurrently to guide expansion doses beginning October 16, 2015; the study is ongoing.The protein agonist BMS-986156 was administered intravenously at a dose of 10, 30, 100, 240, or 800 mg every 2 weeks as monotherapy, and in the combination group 30, 100, 240, or 800 mg plus 240 mg of nivolumab every 2 weeks; same-dose cohorts were pooled for analysis. One cohort also received 480 mg of BMS-986156 plus 480 mg of nivolumab every 4 weeks.The primary end points were safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxic effects. Additional end points included antitumor activity per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, and exploratory biomarker analyses.With a follow-up range of 1.4 to 101.7 weeks (follow-up ongoing), 34 patients (16 women and 18 men; median age, 56.6 years [range, 28-75 years]) received monotherapy (4 patients completed initial treatment), and 258 patients (140 women and 118 men; median age, 60 years [range, 21-87 years]) received combination therapy (65 patients completed initial treatment). No grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse events occurred with BMS-986156 monotherapy; grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 24 patients (9.3%) receiving BMS-986156 plus nivolumab, with no grade 5 treatment-related adverse events. One dose-limiting toxic effect (grade 4 elevated creatine phosphokinase levels) occurred in a patient receiving 800 mg of BMS-986156 plus 240 mg of nivolumab every 2 weeks; BMS-986156 with or without nivolumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics with dose-related increase after a single dose. Peripheral T-cell and natural killer-cell proliferation increased after administration of BMS-986156 with or without nivolumab. No consistent and significant modulation of intratumoral CD8+ T cells and FoxP3+ regulatory T cells was observed.

Dose-intensified chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation failed to improve the prognosis of patients with ATL; however, we first revealed that allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) might improve their prognosis. We showed that reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation using peripheral blood was feasible for elderly patients. Further, the prognosis of patients in remission, who receive cord blood transplantation, has been recently improved and is equivalent to that of patients who receive transplants from other stem cell sources. As for the timing of HCT, the patients who underwent transplantation early showed better outcomes than those who underwent transplantation late. Based on the analysis of patients with aggressive ATL, including those who received transplants, we identified five prognostic factors for poor outcomes: acute-type ATL, poor performance status, high soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels, hypercalcemia, and high C-reactive protein level. Next, we developed a new prognostic index: the modified ATL-PI. The overall survival (OS) rates were significantly higher in patients who underwent allo-HCT than those who did not in the intermediate and high-risk groups stratified using the modified ATL-PI. Two new anti-cancer agents, mogamulizumab and lenalidomide, were recently approved for ATL patients in Japan. They are expected to induce longer survival in ATL patients when administered along with transplantation. However, a retrospective analysis that the risk of severe, acute, and corticosteroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease was higher in patients who received mogamulizumab before allo-HCT, and that mogamulizumab might increase the transplant-related mortality (TRM) rates and decrease the OS rates compared to those of patients who did not receive mogamulizumab. However, our recent study showed that administration of mogamulizumab before allo-HCT tended to improve the survival of patients with ATL. In conclusion, allo-HCT procedures for patients with aggressive ATL have considerably progressed and have helped improve the prognosis of these patients; however, many concerns still remain to be resolved.

The programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligand (PD-L1) are expressed in various malignant tumors and have emerged as potential immunotherapeutic targets. However, the immunobiology of TETs is poorly understood. We evaluated PD-L1 expression and the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD8 and CD3 expression) in surgical TET specimens from 39 patients via immunohistochemistry and determined their relation to clinicopathological parameters. Cases with membranous reactivity of the PD-L1 antibody in ≥1% of tumor cells were considered positive. Positive PD-L1 expression was observed in 53.9% of cases. Histologically, PD-L1 expression was positive in 2/6 type A, 2/6 type AB, 3/9 type B1, 4/4 type B2, 5/6 type B3, and 5/8 type C TET cases. Thus, the number of cases with PD-L1 expression and the percent expression of PD-L1 were significantly higher in more aggressive thymomas (type B2 or B3). CD3+ and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were diffusely and abundantly distributed in all cases. These data suggest that a PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is a promising treatment for TETs, with more beneficial treatment effects for aggressive thymomas such as type B2 or B3.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683784>Targeting Immune-Related Biological Processes in Solid Tumors: We do Need Biomarkers.</a></h2><p> has become the standard-of-care in many solid tumors.

We treated 46 recipients of HCT (N=33) or SOT (N=13) with established EBV associated lymphomas, who failed rituximab therapy, with 3rd-party EBV-CTLs. Treatment cycles consisted of 3 weekly infusions of EBV-CTLs and 3 weeks of observation.The EBV-CTLs did not induce significant toxicities or graft injury. One patient developed grade I skin GVHD requiring topical therapy. Complete and sustained partial remissions were achieved in 68% of HCT recipients and 54% of SOT recipients. For patients who achieved CR/PR or stable disease after cycle 1, overall survival was 88.9% and 81.8% respectively at 1 year. Although only 1/11 patients (9.1%) with progression of disease (POD) after cycle 1 who received additional EBV-CTLs from the same donor survived, 3 of 5 with POD subsequently treated with EBV-CTLs from a different donor achieved CR or durable PR (60%) and survive > 1 year. Maximal responses were achieved after a median of 2 cycles.Third party EBV-CTLs of defined HLA restriction provide safe, immediately accessible treatment for EBV PTLD. Secondary treatment with EBV-CTLs restricted by a different HLA allele (switch therapy) can also induce remissions if initial EBV-CTLs are ineffective.

Adaptive immunity is principally founded on T-cell and B-cell populations, but also includes the host microbiome. The gastrointestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem with a great organism diversity and refined genomic structure that resides in the intestinal tract and has a central position in human health and disease.5 Neuroimmune dysregulation, relying of the highly sensitive and fine-tuned equilibrium between microbiome and adaptive immunity, can tip the scales towards neuroinflammation and disruption of higher-order brain networks.4,6,7 During the last decade, the human microbiome and the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB)-axis have become a novel epicentre in mental health research as a potentially vital new determinant in the field of neuroimmunoregulation, brain development, emotions, cognition and behaviour.7 The MGB-axis represents a bidirectional, key communication pathway between the immune system and the brain, thus partly also mediating the regulation of cognitive and emotional processing. An imbalanced human microbiome might greatly influence proper neuroimmune reactions and neurodevelopment with long-lasting effects and could thus play a pivotal role in the susceptibility and aetiology of psychiatric illness. Recent research offers first evidence that patients with SCZ show marked disturbances of gut bacterial taxa composition with a decreased microbiome diversity index, party associated with specific SCZ phenotype, symptom severity and treatment response.8,9 As the elegant education of the adaptive immune compartment depends on the colonization niche, antigen type and metabolic property of different gut microbes, T-cell differentiation as well as a continuous diversification of B-cell repertoire is expressed through microbiome-related, antigen-specific receptors that define a unique clonotype.10 However, there is only sparse evidence on the precise role of the microbiome on the programming of T- and B-cells in the underlying neurobiological pathways of SCZ and even less findings on the association of molecular T- and B-cell receptor repertoire signature and microbiome clonal landscape with specific phenotypical features of the disease.11 The latest conceptual advances in immunology urge an integrative re-evaluation of previous immunological findings in SCZ through modern approaches. High-throughput, next-generation sequencing (NGS) represents a powerful singlecell transcriptomic tool to profile the whole clonal landscape of T and B cells and human microbiome. NGS thus offers a unique opportunity for in-depth characterization of cellular and molecular signatures of adaptive immune receptor repertoires and microbiome taxonomy in SCZ and investigation of their intersection as a relevant pathway of disease progression and phenotype differentiation. SCZ patients are likely to show a diverging host-microbiome immune homeostasis with disease-specific clonotypes of adaptive immune receptor repertoires associated with altered microbiome taxonomy and molecular signature differences, which, in turn, may be related to distinct symptomatic phenotypes and neurocognitive patterns. Such sophisticated immuno-bioinformatic analyses may transform our understanding of SCZ by identification of novel neuroimmune pathways, offering us clinically accessible symptomatic and diagnostic biomarkers important for personalized medicine implications.12 An increased understanding and better characterization of immuno-phenotypes in SCZ will better guide the development of novel immune-based treatments in this severe disease and pave the way for possible prevention options through implementation of antibody engineering, vaccine design, and cellular .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689518>The STAT signaling profile at the single cell level reveals novel insights in the association of FOXP3+ T regulatory cells with recurrent spontaneous abortions before and after lymphocyte .</a></h2><p>Foxp3+ T regulatory cell (Tregs) are central in the pathobiology of recurrent spontaneous abortions (RSA).

LIT partially restored all of these signaling axes in Tregs only in women who achieved pregnancy after treatment.

Gal3 expression is altered in many types of cancer, with increased expression generally associated with poor prognosis. Although the mechanisms remain unknown, Gal3 has been implicated in several biological processes involved in cancer progression, including suppression of T cell-mediated immune responses. Extracellular Gal3 binding to the plasma membrane of T cells alters membrane organization and the formation of an immunological synapse. Its multivalent capacity allows Gal3 to interact specifically with different membrane proteins and lipids, influencing endocytosis, trafficking and T cell receptor signalling. The ability of Gal3 to inhibit T cell responses may provide a mechanism by which Gal3 aids in cancer progression.

The recent introduction of the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), or plus chemotherapy, both resulted in the survival benefit for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but it remains unanswered which is superior. The current study aimed to estimate the comparative efficacy and safety of ICI-chemotherapy versus ICI-monotherapy in advanced NSCLC.Studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that ICI monotherapy or ICI plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy in NSCLC were included with available primary endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate, or treatment-related adverse events. A fixed-effect or random-effects model was adopted depending on between-study heterogeneity.A total of 20 RCTs involving 12,025 patients with NSCLC were included. Both ICI-monotherapy and ICI-chemotherapy resulted in significantly prolonged survival compared to chemotherapy and the former led to significantly longer PFS. The magnitude of survival benefits appeared to be greatest among those treated with pembrolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy (OS, 0.56; PFS, 0.54). Additionally, OS and PFS advantages of ICI therapies were observed in patients with NSCLC with low or high programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression level, but not in intermediate PD-L1 TPS.Pembrolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy was recommended as the optimal first-line therapy for advanced patients with NSCLC.

Overexpression of CD47 usually predicts a negative prognosis and seems to contribute to cancer immune evasion. The inhibition of CD47 has shown impressive results in clinical trials in hematologic malignancies, however, for gastrointestinal tumors only preclinical data is available. Inhibition of this myeloid immune checkpoint may yield great clinical benefit due to the abundance of myeloid effector cells.

Two of these phase III randomized trials showed that the anti-PD1 antibodies nivolumab and pembrolizumab were superior to investigators' choice chemotherapy in second-line platinum-refractory R/M HNSCC. Recently, a third phase III randomized trial, KEYNOTE-048, showed that pembrolizumab with chemotherapy was superior to the EXTREME regimen (cis- or carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cetuximab) in all patients, and pembrolizumab monotherapy was superior in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 in first-line R/M HNSCC. Pembrolizumab is now approved as monotherapy in PD-L1 expressing disease (combined positive score ≥1) or in combination with chemotherapy for all patients with R/M HNSCC. Thus, PD-L1 biomarker testing will be routinely used in R/M HNSCC, and this employs a scoring system that incorporates immune cell staining, referred to as the combined positive score (CPS). Additionally, for the 85% of patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1, clinical judgment will guide the choice of pembrolizumab monotherapy or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, until more detailed clinical data are forthcoming to better inform this decision.

This current series of colonic MALT lymphomas shows the indolent nature of the disease, which may be treated with various modalities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683168>Alterations in composition of immune cells and impairment of anti-tumor immune response in aged oral cancer-bearing mice.</a></h2><p>Aging has been suggested to be associated with immune dysregulation. An understanding of alterations in the host immunity with advancing age is, therefore, important for designing immune therapy for elderly cancer patients. In this context, not much is known about age-associated alterations in the immune system in oral cancer.To evaluate age-associated alterations in the immune system, which might affect anti-tumor immune responses in oral cancer, we performed a comparative analysis of the proportion of different immune cells, the proliferative capacity of T cell compartment, and the response against immune therapies targeting immune check point molecules between young and aged oral cancer-bearing mice.The proportion of immune regulatory cells, such as regulatory T cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells, was significantly increased in aged mice compared to that in young mice. Moreover, the expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 on both CD4 and CD8 T cells was elevated in aged mice compared to that in young mice, and the proliferative abilities of CD4 and CD8 T cells derived from aged mice were significantly reduced following stimulation of T-cell receptors. Moreover, tumor growth was significantly enhanced in aged mice compared to that in young mice. However, immunotherapies targeting PD-1, CTLA-4, and PD-L1 resulted in faster tumor regression in aged mice than in young mice.Together, our results indicate that age-associated alterations in the immune system are directly associated with the impairment of anti-tumor immunity in aged mice bearing oral cancer, and might facilitate the progression of the tumor.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The infection causes acute respiratory disease, which was responsible for 838 deaths in these countries, mainly in Saudi Arabia. Viral genomic RNA was detected in whole blood, serum and plasma of infected patients, raising concerns of the safety of blood supplies, especially in endemic areas.Four apheresis platelet units in 100% plasma were inoculated with a clinical MERS-CoV isolate. Spiked units were then treated with amotosalen/UVA to inactivate MERS-CoV. Infectious and genomic viral titres were quantified by plaque assay and quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Inactivated samples were successively passaged thrice on Vero E6 cells to exclude the presence of residual replication-competent viral particles in inactivated platelets.Complete inactivation of MERS-CoV in spiked platelet units was achieved by treatment with Amotosalen/UVA light with a mean log reduction of 4·48 ± 0·3. Passaging of the inactivated samples in Vero E6 showed no viral replication even after 9 days of incubation and three passages. Viral genomic RNA titration in inactivated samples showed titres comparable to those in pre-treatment samples.Amotosalen and UVA light treatment of MERS-CoV-spiked platelet concentrates efficiently and completely inactivated MERS-CoV infectivity (>4 logs), suggesting that such treatment could minimise the risk of transfusion-related MERS-CoV transmission.© 2019 British Blood Transfusion Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681596>Determining Optimal Routes to Surgery for Borderline Resectable Venous Pancreatic Cancer-Where Is the Least Harm and Most Benefit?</a></h2><p>Surgery among patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) and venous disease has emerged as a viable strategy to achieve curative treatment. By definition, these patients are at increased risk of a positive resection margin, however, controversy exists with regards to necessity of radical surgery and optimum pathways with no consensus on definitive treatment. A surgery first approach is possible though outcomes vary but patients can have an efficient pathway to surgery, particularly if biliary drainage is avoided which limits overall complications. Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is emerging as a widely used strategy to improve oncological outcomes, including resection margin status. However, some patients progress on NAT whilst others suffer major complications whilst elderly patients are unlikely to be offered effective NAT limiting the widespread applicability of this therapy. In this article an overview of the entire pathway is presented along with assimilation of current best evidence to determine optimal routes to surgery for BRPC with venous involvement.Copyright © 2019 Pandé and Roberts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689243>CD47 blockade augmentation of Trastuzumab antitumor efficacy dependent upon antibody-dependent-cellular-phagocytosis.</a></h2><p>The HER2-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), Trastuzumab, has been the mainstay of therapy for HER2+ breast cancers (BC) for ~20 years. However, its therapeutic mechanism of action (MOA) remains unclear, with antitumor responses to Trastuzumab remaining heterologous and metastatic HER2+ BC remaining incurable. Consequently, understanding its MOA could enable rational strategies to enhance its efficacy. Using both novel murine and human versions of Trastuzumab, we found its antitumor activity dependent on Fcγ-Receptor stimulation of tumor-associated-macrophages (TAM) and Antibody-Dependent-Cellular-Phagocytosis (ADCP), but not cytotoxicity (ADCC). Trastuzumab also stimulated TAM activation and expansion, but did not require adaptive immunity, natural killer cells, and/or neutrophils. Moreover, inhibition of the innate immune ADCP checkpoint, CD47, significantly enhanced Trastuzumab-mediated ADCP, TAM expansion and activation, resulting in the emergence of a unique hyper-phagocytic macrophage population, improved antitumor responses and prolonged survival. In addition, we found tumor-associated CD47 expression was inversely associated with survival in HER2+ BC patients and that human HER2+ BC xenografts treated with Trastuzumab+CD47 inhibition underwent complete tumor regression. Collectively, our study identifies Trastuzumab-mediated ADCP as a significant antitumor MOA that may be clinically enabled by CD47 blockade to augment therapeutic efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684954>The tumor inflammation signature (TIS) is associated with anti-PD-1 treatment benefit in the CERTIM pan-cancer cohort.</a></h2><p>The 18-gene tumor inflammation signature (TIS) is a clinical research assay that enriches for clinical benefit to immune checkpoint blockade. We evaluated its ability to predict clinical benefit of  in cancer patients treated with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in routine clinical care.The CERTIM cohort is a prospective cohort which includes patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors in Cochin University hospital. RNA extracted from 58 archival formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor blocks (including 38 lung cancers, 5 melanomas, 10 renal carcinomas, 4 urothelial carcinomas and 1 colon carcinoma) was hybridized to a beta version of the NanoString PanCancer IO360™ CodeSet using nCounter technology. Gene expression signatures were correlated with tumor responses (by RECIST criteria) and overall survival. PD-L1 immunostaining on tumor cells was assessed in 37 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples and tumor mutational burden (TMB) measured by whole exome sequencing in 19 of these.TIS scores were significantly associated with complete or partial response to anti-PD-1 treatment in the whole cohort (odds ratio = 2.64, 95% CI [1.4; 6.0], p = 0.008), as well as in the NSCLC population (odds ratio = 3.27, 95% CI [1.2; 11.6], p = 0.03). Patients whose tumor had a high TIS score (upper tertile) showed prolonged overall survival compared to patients whose tumor had lower TIS scores, both in the whole cohort (hazard ratio = 0.37, 95% CI [0.18, 0.76], p = 0.005) and in the NSCLC population (hazard ratio = 0.36, 95% CI [0.14, 0.90], p = 0.02). In the latter, the TIS score was independent from either PD-L1 staining on tumor cells (spearman coefficient 0.2) and TMB (spearman coefficient - 0.2).These results indicate that validated gene expression assay measuring the level of tumor microenvironment inflammation such as TIS, are accurate and independent predictive biomarkers and can be easily implemented in the clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677604>Engineered Jurkat Cells for Targeting Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen on Prostate Cancer Cells by Nanobody-Based Chimeric Antigen Receptor</a></h2><p>Recently, modification of T cells with CAR has been an attractive approach for adoptive  of cancers. Typically, CARs contain a scFv. Most often, scfvs are derived from a monoclonal antibody of murine origin and may be a trigger for host immune system that leads to the T-cell clearance. Nanobody is a specific antigen-binding fragment derived from camelid that has great homology to human VH and low immunogenic potential. Therefore, in this study, nanobody was employed instead of scFv in CAR construct.In this study, a CAR was constructed based on a nanobody against PSMA (NBPII-CAR). At first, Jurkat cells were electroporated with NBPII-CAR, and then flow cytometry was performed for NBPII-CAR expression. For functional analysis, CAR T cells were co-cultured with prostate cancer cells and analyzed for IL-2 secretion, CD25 expression, and cell proliferation.Flow cytometry results confirmed the expression of NBPII-CAR on the transfected Jurkat cells. Our data showed the specificity of engineered Jurkat cells against prostate cancer cells by not only increasing the IL-2 cytokine (about 370 pg/ml) but also expressing the T-cell activation marker CD25 (about 30%). In addition, proliferation of engineered Jurkat cells increased nearly 60% when co-cultured with LNCaP (PSMA+), as compared with DU145 (PSMA-).Here, we describe the ability of nanobody-based CAR to recognize PSMA that leads to the activation of Jurkat cells. This construct might be used as a promising candidate for clinical applications in prostate cancer therapy.</p></html>
