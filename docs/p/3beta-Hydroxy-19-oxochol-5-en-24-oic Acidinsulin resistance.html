However, little is known about its direct impact on the liver.To investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of AITC in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (commonly referred to as NAFLD).To establish a mouse and cellular model of NAFLD, C57BL/6 mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 8 wk, and AML-12 cells were treated with 200 μM palmitate  for 24 h. For AITC treatment, mice were administered AITC (100 mg/kg/d) orally and AML-12 cells were treated with AITC (20 μmol/L).AITC significantly ameliorated HFD-induced weight gain, hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation . Furthermore, serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were markedly reduced in AITC-treated mice. Mechanistically, AITC significantly downregulated the protein levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and its lipogenesis target genes and upregulated the levels of proteins involved in fatty  β-oxidation, as well as the upstream mediators Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα), in the livers of HFD-fed mice. AITC also attenuated the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Consistently, AITC relieved palmitate -induced lipid accumulation and inflammation in AML-12 cells  through the Sirt1/AMPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. Importantly, further studies showed that the curative effect of AITC on lipid accumulation was abolished by siRNA-mediated knockdown of either Sirt1 or AMPKα in AML-12 cells.AITC significantly ameliorates hepatic steatosis and inflammation by activating the Sirt1/AMPK pathway and inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. Therefore, AITC is a potential therapeutic agent for NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566019>Epigenome- and Transcriptome-wide Changes in Muscle Stem Cells from Low Birth Weight Men.</a></h1><p>: Being born with low birth weight (LBW) is a risk factor for muscle  and type 2 diabetes (T2D), which may be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms programmed by the intrauterine environment. Epigenetic mechanisms exert their prime effects in developing cells. We hypothesized that muscle  in LBW subjects may be due to early differential epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations in their immature muscle progenitor cells. : Muscle progenitor cells were obtained from 23 healthy young adult men born at term with LBW, and 15 BMI-matched normal birth weight (NBW) controls. The cells were subsequently cultured and differentiated into myotubes. DNA and RNA were harvested before and after differentiation for genome-wide DNA methylation and RNA expression measurements. After correcting for multiple comparisons (q ≤ 0.05), 56 CpG sites were found to be significantly, differentially methylated in myoblasts from LBW compared with NBW men, of which the top five gene-annotated CpG sites () previously have been associated to regulation of cholesterol, fatty  and glucose metabolism and muscle development or hypertrophy. LBW men displayed markedly decreased myotube gene expression levels of the AMPK-repressing tyrosine kinase gene  and the histone deacetylase gene . Silencing of  and  was associated with impaired myotube formation, which for  reduced muscle glucose uptake. : The data provides evidence of impaired muscle development predisposing LBW individuals to T2D is linked to and potentially caused by distinct DNA methylation and transcriptional changes including down regulation of  and  in their immature myoblast stem cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655133>β-Klotho gene variation is associated with liver damage in children with NAFLD.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in adults and children. Along with obesity, diabetes and , genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile  metabolism and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, it remains to be defined the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with liver damage in NAFLD.We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on liver damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of KLB mutant.The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with increased risk of ballooning and lobular inflammation. KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free fatty  caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB down-regulation obtained by the expression of KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular lipid accumulation and up-regulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression.In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, thus, it has been identified as a therapeutic target. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the KLB rs17618244 G>A genetic variant on liver damage severity in pediatric patients with NAFLD, and the effect of KLB mutant on hepatocellular damage.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating lipid metabolism include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty  synthase (FAS), zinc α 2 glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, , IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured. Liver tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing lipogenesis were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia,  and hepatic fat accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in liver, and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group. Therefore, abnormal lipid metabolism in the liver of developmental rats could be exacerbated by combined exposed to fructose and BPA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555216>Genetics of Growth Disorders-Which Patients Require Genetic Testing?</a></h1><p>The second 360° European Meeting on Growth Hormone Disorders, held in Barcelona, Spain, in June 2017, included a session entitled  vs. , which examined current concepts of genetics and growth in the clinical setting, in terms of both growth failure and overgrowth. For patients with short stature, multiple genes have been identified that result in GH deficiency, which may be isolated or associated with additional pituitary hormone deficiencies, or in growth hormone , primary -like growth factor (IGF) -labile subunit deficiency, IGF-I deficiency, IGF-II deficiency, IGF-I , and primary PAPP-A2 deficiency. While genetic causes of short stature were previously thought to primarily be associated with the GH-IGF-I axis, it is now established that multiple genetic anomalies not associated with the GH-IGF-I axis can result in short stature. A number of genetic anomalies have also been shown to be associated with overgrowth, some of which involve the GH-IGF-I axis. In patients with overgrowth in combination with an intellectual disability, two predominant gene families, the epigenetic regulator genes, and PI3K/AKT pathway genes, have now been identified. Specific processes should be followed for decisions on which patients require genetic testing and which genes should be examined for anomalies. The decision to carry out genetic testing should be directed by the clinical process, not merely for research purposes. The intention of genetic testing should be to direct the clinical options for management of the growth disorder.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461819>[25-hydroxyvitamin D, sex hormone levels and cardiovascular risk among men in northeast area of Henan province].</a></h1><p> To examine associations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations with sex hormone levels and cardiovascular risk factors.

Mice ( = 10) were fed with HFD for 16 weeks to induce obesity and hepatosteatosis and then divided into two groups: HFD + vehicle group injected with the vehicle solution (saline) and HFD + compound C group injected with compound C in saline (5 mg/kg i.p., once a day) for 4 weeks. Liver histology was observed. The expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism and proinflammation in liver tissue were examined. NLRP3 inflammasome expression in liver tissue was detected by the western blot assay. HepG2 cells were pretreated with compound C and/or AICAR for 1 h and then treated with palmitic  (PA) for 3 h. The cells were collected, and mRNA levels were determined.There was a significant reduction in body-weight gain and daily food intake in the HFD + compound C group compared with the HFD + vehicle group ( < 0.05). The glucose tolerance test (GTT) and  tolerance test (ITT) showed that compound C alleviated . Histology analysis showed a significant reduction of hepatic steatosis by compound C. Compound C also significantly decreased fatty  synthesis genes, while increased fatty  oxidation genes. Furthermore, compound C significantly reduced the expression of proinflammatory markers and NLRP3 inflammasome ( < 0.05). Compound C enhanced mRNA levels of SOD1, SOD2, catalase, GPx1, and GPx4 and reduced the p-AMPK/AMPK ratio, which were stimulated by palmitic  (PA). The effect was enhanced by AICAR.Our data suggest that compound C is a potent NAFLD suppressor and an attractive therapeutic target for hepatic steatosis and related metabolic disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31577934>Dietary Sugars Alter Hepatic Fatty  Oxidation via Transcriptional and Post-translational Modifications of Mitochondrial Proteins.</a></h1><p>Dietary sugars, fructose and glucose, promote hepatic de novo lipogenesis and modify the effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) on the development of . Here, we show that fructose and glucose supplementation of an HFD exert divergent effects on hepatic mitochondrial function and fatty  oxidation. This is mediated via three different nodes of regulation, including differential effects on malonyl-CoA levels, effects on mitochondrial size/protein abundance, and acetylation of mitochondrial proteins. HFD- and HFD plus fructose-fed mice have decreased CTP1a activity, the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty  oxidation, whereas knockdown of fructose metabolism increases CPT1a and its acylcarnitine products. Furthermore, fructose-supplemented HFD leads to increased acetylation of ACADL and CPT1a, which is associated with decreased fat metabolism. In summary, dietary fructose, but not glucose, supplementation of HFD impairs mitochondrial size, function, and protein acetylation, resulting in decreased fatty  oxidation and development of metabolic dysregulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by . Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty  concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS. Free fatty  and liver fat were inversely associated with muscle IS, which argues for lipid-targeted interventions.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625210>Genes acting in longevity-related pathways in the endoparasitoid, Pteromalus puparum.</a></h1><p>Among insects, lifespans vary over a broad range, from the short-lived mayflies to the 17-year periodical cicadas. Generally, lifespans are determined by a phase in life, the reproductive lifespan, which varies among species. Numerous pathways, such as the /-like growth factor signaling pathway, the target of rapamycin pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinases pathways, influence aging and lifespan. Components of these pathways were identified as lifespan-related genes, including genes mediating growth, metabolism, development, , and other processes. Many age-related genes have been discovered in fruit flies, honeybees, and ants among other insect species. Studies of insect aging and longevity can help understand insect biology and develop new pest management technologies. In this paper, we interrogated the new Pteromalus puparum genome, from which we predicted 133 putative lifespan-related genes based on their homology with known lifespan-related genes of Drosophila melanogaster. These genes function in five signaling pathways and three physiological processes. The conserved domain structures of these genes were predicted and their expression patterns were analyzed. Amino  sequence alignments and domain structure analysis indicate that most components remain conserved across at least six insect orders. The data in this paper will facilitate future work on parasitoid lifespans, which may have economic value in biocontrol programs.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635188>A Fermented Food Product Containing Lactic  Bacteria Protects ZDF Rats from the Development of Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h1><p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disease, which involves a maintained hyperglycemia due to the development of an  process. Among multiple risk factors, host intestinal microbiota has received increasing attention in T2D etiology and progression. In the present study, we have explored the effect of long-term supplementation with a non-dairy fermented food product (FFP) in Zucker Diabetic and Fatty (ZDF) rats T2D model. The supplementation with FFP induced an improvement in glucose homeostasis according to the results obtained from fasting blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance test, and pancreatic function. Importantly, a significantly reduced intestinal glucose absorption was found in the FFP-treated rats. Supplemented animals also showed a greater survival suggesting a better health status as a result of the FFP intake. Some dissimilarities have been observed in the gut microbiota population between control and FFP-treated rats, and interestingly a tendency for better cardiometabolic markers values was appreciated in this group.

Emerging data suggest that chronic vinegar ingestion impacts fat metabolism and reduces adiposity, although no study has yet corroborated the events of vinegar supplementation metabolically through a metabolomics approach. To examine the impact of daily vinegar ingestion on glucose homeostasis, adiposity, and the metabolome, an 8-week, randomized controlled trial design was implemented utilizing two parallel treatment arms: daily red wine vinegar ingestion and a control treatment. Participants were 45 healthy adults at increased risk for metabolic complications as determined by high waist circumferences. Measurements and blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention. Central adiposity and visceral fat were assessed by waist circumference and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, respectively.

Again, adiponectin upregulates mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle thereby improving glucose/lipid metabolism and . These findings suggested that activation of adiponectin/AdipoR signaling could represent a viable therapeutic approach to lifestyle-linked diseases associated with prevalent obesity thus contributing to healthy longevity in humans. Indeed, they have led to the successful discovery of AdipoRon, a small-molecule AdipoR-activating compound. Thus far, AdipoRon has been found not only to improve  in mice but to prolong their lifespan shortened by high-fat diet. Additionally, our structure-based drug discovery research has led to AdipoR being identified as an entirely novel structure having a zinc iron bound within its seven-transmembrane domain as well as an opposite orientation to that of G protein-coupled receptors. It is expected that increasing insight into AdipoR signaling will facilitate the structure-based optimization of candidate small-molecule AdipoR-activating compounds for human use as well as the development of molecularly targeted and calorie-limiting/exercise-mimicking agents for lifestyle-linked diseases.© The Japan Diabetes Society 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511709>Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma 34C>G variant and anthropometric parameters in metabolic syndrome.</a></h1><p>To determine the frequency of 34 Cytosine >Guanine (proline 12 alanine) variant of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, and to associate it with metabolic syndrome,  and anthropometric obesity parameters.The cross-sectional comparative study was conducted at the University of Health Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan, from September 2016 to 2017, and comprised patients of metabolic syndrome and healthy controls.

Though effective in reducing psychoses, acute olanzapine treatment causes rapid increases in blood glucose that are believed to be mediated by increases in liver glucose output, skeletal muscle , and beta cell dysfunction. Further, the acute lipidemic response to olanzapine has been largely unexplored. While females have been reported to be more susceptible to olanzapine-induced weight gain, there is little known about the impact of sex on the acute response to SGAs. The purpose of this study was to determine if the acute effects of SGAs on glucose and lipid metabolism display a sexually dimorphic response in C57BL/6 J mice and examine potential mechanisms mediating this effect. Age matched male and female C57BL/6 J mice were treated with olanzapine (5 mg/ kg, IP) or vehicle control and blood glucose was measured at baseline, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min post-treatment and tissues and serum harvested. These experiments were repeated, and mice underwent an  (0.5 IU/kg) or pyruvate tolerance test (2 g/kg) following 60 min of olanzapine treatment. Females were protected against olanzapine-induced increases in blood glucose and pyruvate intolerance compared to male mice, and this occurred despite the development of severe . In male mice olanzapine increased the glucagon: ratio whereas in females this ratio was reduced. When challenged with exogenous glucagon (1 mg/kg IP), females were less responsive than males. Male and female mice displayed similar increases in whole body fatty  oxidation, serum fatty  and liver triglyceride accumulation. Our findings provide evidence that while there are no apparent sex differences in the lipid metabolism response to olanzapine, that females are protected from acute olanzapine-induced excursions in blood glucose. This is likely due in part to reductions in the glucagon: ratio and glucagon responsiveness which could impact olanzapine induced increases in liver glucose production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The exact mechanisms by which the plasma FFA profile of subjects with T2DM changes is unclear, but it is thought that dietary fats and changes to lipid metabolism are likely to contribute. Therefore, establishing the changes in concentrations of specific FFAs in an individual's plasma is important. Each type of FFA has different effects on physiological processes, including the regulation of lipolysis and lipogenesis in adipose tissue, inflammation, endocrine signalling and the composition and properties of cellular membranes. Alterations in such processes due to altered plasma FFA concentrations/profiles can potentially result in the development of  and coagulatory defects. Finally, fibrates and statins, lipid-regulating drugs prescribed to subjects with T2DM, are also thought to exert part of their beneficial effects by impacting on plasma FFA concentrations. Thus, it is also interesting to consider their effects on the concentration of FFAs in plasma. Collectively, we review how FFAs are altered in T2DM and explore the likely downstream physiological and pathological implications of such changes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665391>A Combination of Metabolites Predicts Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet Pattern and Its Associations with  Sensitivity and Lipid Homeostasis in the General Population: The Fenland Study, United Kingdom.</a></h1><p>Cardiometabolic benefits of the Mediterranean diet have been recognized, but underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.We aimed to investigate how the Mediterranean diet could influence circulating metabolites and how the metabolites could mediate the associations of the diet with cardiometabolic risk factors.Among 10,806 participants (58.9% women, mean age = 48.4 y) in the Fenland Study (2004-2015) in the United Kingdom, we assessed dietary consumption with FFQs and conducted a targeted metabolomics assay for 175 plasma metabolites (acylcarnitines, amines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids). We examined cross-sectional associations of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and its major components with each metabolite, modeling multivariable-adjusted linear regression. We used the regression estimates to summarize metabolites associated with the MDS into a metabolite score as a marker of the diet. Subsequently, we assessed how much metabolite subclasses and the metabolite score would mediate the associations of the MDS with circulating lipids, homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR), and other metabolic factors by comparing regression estimates upon adjustment for the metabolites.Sixty-six metabolites were significantly associated with the MDS (P ≤ 0.003, corrected for false discovery rate) (Spearman correlations, r: -0.28 to +0.28). The metabolite score was moderately correlated with the MDS (r = 0.43). Of MDS components, consumption of nuts, cereals, and meats contributed to variations in acylcarnitines; fruits, to amino  and amines; and fish, to phospholipids. The metabolite score was estimated to explain 37.2% of the inverse association of the MDS with HOMA-IR (P for mediation < 0.05). The associations of the MDS with cardiometabolic factors were estimated to be mediated by acylcarnitines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids.Multiple metabolites relate to the Mediterranean diet in a healthy general British population and highlight the potential to identify a set of biomarkers for an overall diet. The associations may involve pathways of phospholipid metabolism, carnitine metabolism, and development of  and dyslipidemia.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571412>Impact of Acipimox Therapy on Free Fatty  Efflux and Endothelial Function in the Metabolic Syndrome: A Randomized Trial.</a></h1><p> is associated with increased lipolysis and elevated concentrations of free fatty  (FFA), which in turn contribute to impaired vascular function. It was hypothesized that lowering FFA with acipimox, a nicotinic  derivative that impairs FFA efflux, would improve endothelial function, measured by flow-mediated dilation (FMD), in individuals with metabolic syndrome.A total of 18 participants with metabolic syndrome and 17 healthy controls were enrolled and treated with acipimox 250 mg orally every 6 hours or placebo for 7 days in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial.Acipimox reduced FFA concentrations among individuals with metabolic syndrome to near normal levels (P = 0.01), but there was no change among healthy controls (P = 0.17). Acipimox did not improve endothelial-dependent FMD in either group (metabolic syndrome: P = 0.42; healthy controls: P = 0.16), although endothelial-independent nitroglycerin-mediated dilation among those with metabolic syndrome tended to increase (20.3%, P = 0.06). There were no changes in blood lipids or markers of inflammation following therapy. There was minimal correlation between change in FMD and baseline measures of BMI ( ρ = -0.09) or waist circumference ( ρ = -0.15).In groups with normal or elevated baseline FFA, short-term reductions do not improve endothelial function assessed by FMD.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415180>Regulation of mitochondrial metabolism in murine skeletal muscle by the medium-chain fatty  receptor Gpr84.</a></h1><p>Fatty  receptors have been recognized as important players in glycaemic control. This study is the first to describe a role for the medium-chain fatty  (MCFA) receptor G-protein-coupled receptor (Gpr) 84 in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and  secretion. We are able to show that Gpr84 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Mice with global deletion of  [ knockout (KO)] exhibit a mild impairment in glucose tolerance when fed a MCFA-enriched diet. Studies in mice and pancreatic islets suggest that glucose intolerance is accompanied by a defect in  secretion. MCFA-fed KO mice also exhibit a significant impairment in the intrinsic respiratory capacity of their skeletal muscle mitochondria, but at the same time also exhibit a substantial increase in mitochondrial content. Changes in canonical pathways of mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover are unable to explain these mitochondrial differences. Our results show that Gpr84 plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial function and quality control.-Montgomery, M. K., Osborne, B., Brandon, A. E., O'Reilly, L., Fiveash, C. E., Brown, S. H.

In this study, the regulatory effects of tartary buckwheat starch on blood lipid level and gut microbiota (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, and Escherichia coli) in mice fed with a high-fat diet was investigated. Male C57BL/6 mice were separately fed with a normal diet (CON), a high-fat diet (HFD), and high-fat diet supplemented with buckwheat-resistant starch (HFD+BRS) for 6 weeks. After the feedings, lipid profile, blood glucose, plasma levels of cytokines, short-chain fatty  content in the colon and intestinal flora of fecal were measured. Furthermore, the antioxidant indices of the liver and duodenum tissues were measured to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of mice. Significantly reduced plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), glucose, and cytokines were observed in the HFD+BRS group, accompanied by an increased antioxidant capacity in the liver and duodenum. In addition, supplementation with BRS significantly inhibited the increase in plasma lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6 levels. Gut microbiota composition was regulated by the supplement of BRS, which promoted the growth of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterococcus, as well as inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli. In contrast to the HFD group, the content of short-chain fatty  in mice colon increased in the BRS group. In conclusion, BRS benefited the cholesterol and glucose metabolism, as well as optimized gut microbiota composition in mice fed with a high-fat diet. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study identified the beneficial effects of tartary buckwheat-resistant starch on the regulation of blood lipids and intestinal flora in mice fed a high-fat diet. The result of this study will provide a basis for the development of probiotic products supplemented with tartary buckwheat-resistant starch and direction for further research.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31432072>Plasma metabolomics profiles suggest beneficial effects of a low-glycemic load dietary pattern on inflammation and energy metabolism.</a></h1><p>Low-glycemic load dietary patterns, characterized by consumption of whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables, are associated with reduced risk of several chronic diseases.Using samples from a randomized, controlled, crossover feeding trial, we evaluated the effects on metabolic profiles of a low-glycemic whole-grain dietary pattern (WG) compared with a dietary pattern high in refined grains and added sugars (RG) for 28 d. LC-MS-based targeted metabolomics analysis was performed on fasting plasma samples from 80 healthy participants (n = 40 men, n = 40 women) aged 18-45 y. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate differences in response between diets for individual metabolites. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)-defined pathways and 2 novel data-driven analyses were conducted to consider differences at the pathway level.There were 121 metabolites with detectable signal in >98% of all plasma samples. Eighteen metabolites were significantly different between diets at day 28 [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05]. Inositol, hydroxyphenylpyruvate, citrulline, ornithine, 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic , glutamine, and oxaloacetate were higher after the WG diet than after the RG diet, whereas melatonin, betaine, creatine, acetylcholine, aspartate, hydroxyproline, methylhistidine, tryptophan, cystamine, carnitine, and trimethylamine were lower. Analyses using KEGG-defined pathways revealed statistically significant differences in tryptophan metabolism between diets, with kynurenine and melatonin positively associated with serum C-reactive protein concentrations. Novel data-driven methods at the metabolite and network levels found correlations among metabolites involved in branched-chain amino  (BCAA) degradation, trimethylamine-N-oxide production, and β oxidation of fatty  (FDR < 0.1) that differed between diets, with more favorable metabolic profiles detected after the WG diet. Higher BCAAs and trimethylamine were positively associated with homeostasis model assessment-.These exploratory metabolomics results support beneficial effects of a low-glycemic load dietary pattern characterized by whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables, compared with a diet high in refined grains and added sugars on inflammation and energy metabolism pathways.

Given that -related endothelial dysfunction in obesity attributes to fatty--induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, in this study, we addressed the possible role of TRPM2 in obesity-related endothelial  and the underlying mechanisms. Whole-cell patch clamp technique, intracellular Ca concentration measurement, western blot, vasorelaxation assay, and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese model were employed to assess the relationship between TRPM2 and endothelial  response. We found that both the expression and activity of TRPM2 were higher in endothelial cells of obese mice. Palmitate rose a cationic current in endothelial cells which was inhibited or enlarged by TRPM2 knockdown or overexpression. Silencing of TRPM2 remarkably improved -induced endothelial Akt activation, nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation and nitric oxide (NO) production, while TRPM2 overexpression resulted in the opposite effects. Furthermore, TRPM2-mediated Ca entry, CaMKII activation and the following activation of PERK/ATF4/TRB3 cascade were involved in the mechanism of obesity or palmitate-induced endothelial . Notably, in vivo study, knockdown of TRPM2 with adeno-associated virus harboring short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) against TRPM2 alleviated endothelial  and ameliorated endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in obese mice. Thus, these results suggest that TRPM2-activated Ca signaling is necessary to induce -related endothelial dysfunction in obesity. Downregulation or pharmacological inhibition of TRPM2 channels may lead to the development of effective drugs for treatment of endothelial dysfunction associated with oxidative stress state.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, this study was conducted to initially assess the effects of systemic administration of rbIL-8 on response to a glucose challenge, blood metabolites, , growth hormone, -like growth factor-1, immune cell populations, and inflammatory parameters in Holstein bull calves. Calves from 30 ± 6 d of life were individually housed and randomly allocated to 1 of 2 treatment groups: rbIL-8 (rbIL-8, n = 10) and control (CTR, n = 8). Calves assigned to the rbIL-8 group received 1 s.c. injection (d 1, 0900 h) and 6 i.v. injections (d 1 at 1600 h, d 2 and 3 at 0900 h and 1600 h, and d 4 at 0900 h) of rbIL-8 (4 μg/kg of body weight), whereas the CTR group received 2 mL of sterile saline solution at each time point. Day of enrollment was considered as d 1, and the study duration was 10 d.  concentrations and whole-body glucose disappearance were evaluated by an i.v. glucose tolerance test conducted at 12 h and 7 d following the last rbIL-8 injection. Rectal temperature and blood samples were collected on d 1, 2, 3, and 4 at -30 (before treatment, 0830 h), 30, 60, 120, 240, and 360 min relative to treatment, and daily at 0830 h for the rest of the study period. Serum was harvested, and the following parameters were measured: β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), nonesterified fatty , glucose, , plasma urea nitrogen, haptoglobin, and differential blood count. Significant differences were considered when P ≤ 0.05 and a trend if 0.05 <P ≤ 0.10. Serum glucose levels and glucose area under the curve (AUC) did not differ between treatment groups in response to the glucose challenge. However, calves treated with rbIL-8 had greater serum  concentration and  AUC compared with controls. Administration of rbIL-8 increased rectal temperature (rbIL-8 = 39.3 ± 0.1; CTR = 38.9 ± 0.1°C; ±standard error), BHB concentrations (rbIL-8 = 3.54 ± 0.10; CTR = 2.99 ± 0.12 mg/dL), counts of lymphocytes (rbIL-8 = 4.52 ± 0.12; CTR = 3.84 ± 0.14 × 10/μL), monocytes (rbIL-8 = 0.87 ± 0.03; CTR = 0.67 ± 0.04 × 10/μL), and granulocytes (rbIL-8 = 3.54 ± 0.22; CTR = 2.66 ± 0.24 × 10/μL).

Obesity, low-grade chronic inflammatory status, and  (IR) often coexist in PCOS. The Mediterranean diet (MD) is an anti-inflammatory dietary pattern, which is rich in complex carbohydrates and fiber, and high in monounsaturated fat. There is a close association among obesity, low-grade chronic inflammation, IR, and hormonal derangements in PCOS. The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the adherence to MD, the dietary intake, and the body composition and their association with PCOS clinical severity in a cohort of treatment-naïve women with PCOS when compared with a control group of healthy women matched for age and body mass index (BMI). In this case-controlled, cross-sectional study, we enrolled 112 patients with PCOS and 112 controls. PREvención con DIetaMEDiterránea (PREDIMED) and seven-day food records were used to evaluate the degree of adherence to the MD and dietary pattern, respectively. Body composition was evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) phase-sensitive system. Testosterone levels and Ferriman-Gallwey score assessed the clinical severity of PCOS. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined with a nephelometric assay with CardioPhase high sensitivity. PCOS women showed higher testosterone levels, Ferriman-Gallwey score, fasting  and glucose levels, and Homeostatic Model Assessment (HoMA)-IR when compared with the control group ( < 0.001). In addition, we found that the PCOS women consumed less extra-virgin olive oil, legumes, fish/seafood, and nuts compared with control group. Despite no differences in energy intake between the two groups, the PCOS women consumed a lower quantity of complex carbohydrate, fiber, monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA), and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), and higher quantity of simple carbohydrate, total fat, saturated fatty  (SFA), PUFA and n-6 PUFA than the control group. The PCOS women have an adverse body composition when compared with controls, with the lowest values of phase angle (PhA) and fat-free mass ( < 0.001). Additionally, after adjusting for BMI and total energy intake, testosterone levels showed significant negative correlations with PREDIMED score ( < 0.001) and consumption of protein ( = 0.005), complex carbohydrate ( < 0.001), fiber ( < 0.001), MUFA ( < 0.001), n-3 PUFA ( = 0.001), and positive associations with CRP levels, simple carbohydrate, SFA, n-6 PUFA ( < 0.001, respectively), and PUFA ( = 0.002). The cut-off for PREDIMED score ≤ 6 ( < 0.001, area under the curve (AUC) 0.848, standard error 0.036, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.768 to 0.909) could serve as a threshold for significantly increased risk of high value of testosterone levels. In conclusion, a novel direct association between the adherence to MD and the clinical severity of the disease was reported in women with PCOS. This association could support a therapeutic role of foods and nutrients of the Mediterranean dietary pattern in the PCOS pathogenesis likely involving their inflammatory status, IR, and hyperandrogenemia. In addition, we reported a different body composition that is characterized by lower PhA and fat-free mass than controls. These data suggested a role of PhA as a useful marker of the clinical severity of this syndrome and provided strong evidence regarding the strategic relevance of the nutritional assessment in the management of women with PCOS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620596>The effect of thalidomide on visceral fat pad mass and triglyceride concentration of the skeletal muscles in rats.</a></h1><p>Body fats, especially both of abdominal fat pad mass and skeletal muscle fat content, are inversely related to  action.

Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561638>Metabolic Fingerprint of Acromegaly and its Potential Usefulness in Clinical Practice.</a></h1><p>-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and growth hormone (GH) levels are the main targets for monitoring acromegaly activity, but they are not in close relationship with the clinical course of the disease and the associated comorbidities. The present study was aimed at identifying metabolites that could be used as biomarkers for a better disease phenotyping. For this purpose, metabolic fingerprint using an untargeted metabolomic approach was examined in serum from 30 patients with acromegaly and 30 age-matched controls. Patients with acromegaly presented fewer branched-chain amino  (BCAAs) compared to the control group (valine: 4.75 ± 0.87 vs. 5.20 ± 1.06 arbitrary units (AUs),  < 0.05; isoleucine: 2.54 ± 0.41 vs. 2.80 ± 0.51 AUs;  < 0.05). BCAAs were also lower in patients with active disease compared to patients with normal levels of IGF-1 with or without medical treatment.

These findings indicate that low levels of BCAAs represent the main metabolic fingerprint of acromegaly and that GH, rather than IGF-1, might be the primary mediator. In addition, our results suggest that the assessment of BCAAs could help to identify active disease and to monitor the response to therapeutic strategies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474235>Niacin nutrition and rumen-protected niacin supplementation in dairy cows: an updated review.</a></h1><p>As the precursor to NAD+ and NADP+, niacin is important for catabolic and anabolic redox reactions. In addition, niacin is known for its anti-lipolytic action via a hydroxycarboxylic -2-receptor-dependent mechanism. The anti-lipolytic effects of traditional free niacin supplementation during transition periods had been studied extensively, but the reported effects are ambiguous. In the past decade, a series of studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of rumen-protected niacin (RPN) on production performance and metabolic status in early lactation and on heat stress in dairy cows. Feeding RPN seems more effective than free niacin regarding increasing circulating niacin concentration. The rebound of plasma NEFA was found after termination of niacin abomasal infusion. Feeding RPN or infusion of niacin via the abomasum could suppress lipolysis and reduce  in early lactation. Additionally, RPN supplementation could possibly relieve heat stress through vasodilation during moderate to severe heat stress condition. However, these beneficial effects of niacin supplementation have not always been observed. The inconsistent results across studies may be related to dosages of niacin supplementation, rebound of plasma NEFA concentration, stage of lactation or severity of heat stress. Overall, the current review is to present updated information on niacin nutrition in dairy cows and the recommendations are given for future research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487425>Mannan Oligosaccharide Suppresses Lipid Accumulation and Appetite in Western-Diet-Induced Obese Mice Via Reshaping Gut Microbiome and Enhancing Short-Chain Fatty  Production.</a></h1><p>Obesity is associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis. Mannose oligosaccharide (MOS) has been reported to be a potential prebiotic. The present study is aimed to determine the effects of MOS on western-diet-induced obesity and to uncover the mediating roles of the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites.Three-month-old male ICR mice are fed with a high-fat and high-fructose diet for 8 weeks. The diet-induced obese mice are then orally administrated with MOS (100 and 200 mg kg  d ) for 4 weeks. MOS significantly reduces bodyweight gain, , fatty liver, and inflammatory responses in obese mice. MOS also stimulates lipolysis and inhibits lipogenesis in the adipose tissues. Moreover, MOS restructures the gut microbiome by enhancing the abundance of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in obese mice. The microbial metabolite SCFAs are also increased in the feces and serum. Correlation analysis indicates that the appetite suppression and lipid-lowering effects of MOS are highly correlated with the butyrate levels.MOS suppresses the appetite, which results in less lipid deposition. The lower appetite is likely due to an altered gut microbiome and elevated SCFAs production. MOS may be a potential nutraceutical used in body weight management and gut health improvement.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Here, the study aimed to ascertain whether and how exercise mediates IR in T2DM. An in vivo mouse model of high-fat diet-induced IR and an in vitro high-glucose-induced IR model were constructed. High long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) expression was detected in T2MD and was positively correlated with HOMA-IR and resistin levels. Then, short hairpin RNA targeting MALAT1 (sh-MALAT1) or pcDNA-MALAT1 was delivered into human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to knock down or upregulate its expression, respectively. Silencing of MALAT1 resulted in reduced levels of resistin, Ang II, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and p- receptor substrate-1 (p-IRS)/ISR-1, and decreased cell migration, as well as enhanced glucose uptake and levels of nitric oxide (NO) and p-Akt/Akt. In the IR mouse model, exercise was observed to downregulate MALAT1 to reduce resistin, whereby exercise reduced homeostatic model assessment- (HOMA-IR). Besides, exercise also elevated microRNA-382-3p (miR-382-3p) expression in the serum of IR mice. Dual-luciferase reporter and RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays identified that MALAT1 could bind to miR-382-3p to upregulate resistin. Collectively, the key observations of the study provide evidence that inhibition of MALAT1 elevates miR-382-3p to repress resistin, which consequently underlies the mechanism of exercise protecting against IR, highlighting a direction for T2DM therapy development.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

BAT has been previously assumed to contain a homogeneous population of brown adipocytes. Utilizing multiple mouse models capable of genetically labeling different cellular populations, as well as single-cell RNA sequencing, and 3D tissue profiling, we discovered a new brown adipocyte subpopulation with low thermogenic activity co-existing with the classical high thermogenic brown adipocytes within the BAT. These low thermogenic brown adipocytes had significantly lower Ucp1 and Adipoq expression, larger lipid droplets, and lower mitochondrial content. Functional analyses showed that the low thermogenic brown adipocytes have significant lower basal mitochondrial respiration, and they are specialized in fatty  uptake. Upon changes in environmental temperature, the two brown adipocyte subpopulations underwent dynamic inter-conversions. Cold exposure converted low thermogenic brown adipocytes into high thermogenic cells, and a thermoneutral environment had the opposite effect. This recruitment of high thermogenic brown adipocytes by cold stimulation is not affected by high fat diet feeding, but significantly declined with age. Our results revealed a high degree of functional heterogeneity of brown adipocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654570>Fibroblast growth factor 21 protects against lipotoxicity-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction via regulation of AMPK signaling and lipid metabolism.</a></h1><p>Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is known as a potent metabolic regulator but its protective mechanisms against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis remain elusive. Here, we aimed to examine the regulatory pathways whereby FGF21 mediates islet lipid metabolism in lipotoxicity-treated cells and animal models. Rat β-cell line (INS-1E cells) and islets isolated from C57/BL6J mice were exposed to palmitic  (PA) with/without FGF21, mimicking lipotoxic conditions. Resultant  secretion and intracellular signaling were analyzed with Western blotting and RNA-seq. C57/BL6J and global FGF21 knockout (KO) mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce lipotoxicity and given with a long-acting mimetic of FGF21.  and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced lipid accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated  secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty  (FA) oxidation and reduced lipid deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell lipid accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

HMB is a leucine metabolite, which is one of three branched chain amino . HMB plays multiple roles in the human body of which most important ones include protein metabolism,  activity and skeletal muscle hypertrophy. The ergogenic effects of HMB supplementation are related to the enhancement of sarcolemma integrity, inhibition of protein degradation (ubiquitin pathway), decreased cell apoptosis, increased protein synthesis (mTOR pathway), stimulation of the growth hormone/-like growth factor-1 (GH/IGF-1) axis and enhancement of muscle stem cells proliferation and differentiation. HMB supplementation has been carried out with various groups of athletes. In endurance and martial arts athletes, HMB supplementation revealed positive effects on specific aerobic capacity variables. Positive results were also disclosed in  trained athletes, where changes in strength, body fat and muscle mass as well as anaerobic performance and power output were observed. The purpose of this review was to present the main mechanisms of HMB action, especially related to muscle protein synthesis and degradation, and ergogenic effects on different types of sports and physical activities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415794>Creosote bush-derived NDGA attenuates molecular and pathological changes in a novel mouse model of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).</a></h1><p>Creosote bush (Larrea tridentata)-derived nordihydroguaiaretic  (NDGA) was shown to have profound effects on the core components of metabolic syndrome. This study investigated the in vivo potential of NDGA for prevention or attenuation of the pathophysiologic abnormalities of NASH. A novel dietary NASH model with feeding C57BL/6J mice with a high trans-fat, high cholesterol and high fructose (HTF) diet, was used. The HTF diet fed mice exhibited obesity, , hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, inflammation, ER stress, oxidative stress, and liver injury. NDGA attenuated these metabolic abnormalities as well as hepatic steatosis and fibrosis together with attenuated expression of genes encoding fibrosis, progenitor and macrophage markers with no effect on the levels of mRNAs for lipogenic enzymes. NDGA increased expression of fatty  oxidation genes.

We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the obesity-associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of deoxycholic , cholic , 1H-indole-3-acetic , 3-indole acrylic  and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. 2-Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic , l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the body weight and triglycerides and improved  mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on.

How long-term dietary BCAAs impact late-life health and lifespan is unknown. Here, we show that when dietary BCAAs are varied against a fixed, isocaloric macronutrient background, long-term exposure to high BCAA diets leads to hyperphagia, obesity and reduced lifespan. These effects are not due to elevated BCAA  or hepatic mTOR activation, but rather due to a shift in the relative quantity of dietary BCAAs and other AAs, notably tryptophan and threonine. Increasing the ratio of BCAAs to these AAs resulted in hyperphagia and is associated with central serotonin depletion. Preventing hyperphagia by calorie restriction or pair-feeding averts the health costs of a high BCAA diet. Our data highlight a role for amino  quality in energy balance and show that health costs of chronic high BCAA intakes need not be due to intrinsic toxicity but, rather, a consequence of hyperphagia driven by AA imbalance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31439647>Crucial Role of the SH2B1 PH Domain for the Control of Energy Balance.</a></h1><p>Disruption of the adaptor protein SH2B1 (SH2-B, PSM) is associated with severe obesity, , and neurobehavioral abnormalities in mice and humans.

Four obesity-associated human  variants lie in the Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, suggesting that the PH domain is essential for SH2B1's function. We generated a mouse model of a human variant in this domain (P322S). P322S/P322S mice exhibited substantial prenatal lethality. Examination of the P322S/+ metabolic phenotype revealed late-onset glucose intolerance. To circumvent P322S/P322S lethality, mice containing a two-amino  deletion within the SH2B1 PH domain (ΔP317, R318 [ΔPR]) were studied. Mice homozygous for ΔPR were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and exhibited obesity plus  and glucose intolerance beyond that attributable to their increased adiposity.

BCAAs had robust associations with many adverse metabolic risk factors (increased glucose, , Homeostatic Model Assessment for  (HOMA-IR), triglycerides; decreased HDL cholesterol). However, paradoxically, participants with lower levels of BCAAs had greater mortality and MACE possibly because increasing age and frailty, both of which were associated with lower BCAA levels, are powerful risk factors for these outcomes in older people. Overall, amino  that were lowest in frail subjects (BCAAs, α-aminobutyric  (AABA), histidine, lysine, methionine, threonine, tyrosine) were inversely associated with mortality and MACE. In conclusion, BCAAs are biomarkers for important outcomes in older people including cardiometabolic risk factors, frailty and mortality.

ELOVL fatty  elongase 6 (Elovl6) is responsible for converting C16 saturated and monounsaturated fatty  (FAs) into C18 species. We have previously shown that Elovl6 contributes to obesity-induced  by modifying hepatic C16/C18-related FA composition. To define the precise molecular mechanism by which hepatic Elovl6 affects energy homeostasis and metabolic disease, we generated liver-specific Elovl6 knockout (LKO) mice. Unexpectedly, LKO mice were not protected from high-fat diet-induced . Instead, LKO mice exhibited higher  sensitivity than controls when consuming a high-sucrose diet (HSD), which induces lipogenesis. Hepatic patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (Pnpla3) expression was downregulated in LKO mice, and adenoviral Pnpla3 restoration reversed the enhancement in  sensitivity in HSD-fed LKO mice. Lipidomic analyzes showed that the hepatic ceramide(d18:1/18:0) content was lower in LKO mice, which may explain the effect on  sensitivity. Ceramide(d18:1/18:0) enhances protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity by interfering with the binding of PP2A to its biological inhibitor I2PP2A, leading to Akt dephosphorylation. Its production involves the formation of an Elovl6-ceramide synthase 4 (CerS4) complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a Pnpla3-CerS4 complex on lipid droplets (LDs). Consistent with this, liver-specific Elovl6 deletion in ob/ob mice reduced both hepatic ceramide(d18:1/18:0) and PP2A activity, and ameliorated .

In the present study, we hypothesized that the increased milk production associated with rbIL-8 treatment is a consequence of increased postpartum dry matter intake (DMI) and orchestrated homeorhetic changes that prioritize milk production. Cows were enrolled into 1 of 3 treatment groups: those assigned to the control group (CTR; n = 70) received an intrauterine (IU) administration of 500 mL of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) solution and 1 mL of DPBS solution intravenously (IV; jugular vein), those assigned to the rbIL-8 IV group (rbIL8-IV, n = 70) received an IV injection of 167 μg of rbIL-8 and 500 mL of DPBS solution IU, and cows assigned to the rbIL-8 IU group (rbIL8-IU, n = 70) received an IU administration with 1,195 μg of rbIL-8 diluted in 499.5 mL of DPBS solution and 1 mL of DPBS solution IV.

Additionally, liver biopsy samples were taken at 14 DIM from the same subgroup of cows to measure triglyceride levels and cell proliferation and apoptosis. Cows treated with rbIL8-IU produced more milk (CTR = 36.9 ± 1.5; rbIL8-IU = 38.5 ± 1.5; rbIL8-IV = 36.6 ± 1.5 kg/d), energy-corrected milk (CTR = 42.9 ± 0.9; rbIL8-IU = 46.1 ± 0.8; rbIL8-IV = 43.7 ± 0.9 kg/d), and fat-corrected milk (CTR = 44.3 ± 0.9; rbIL8-IU = 47.8 ± 0.9; rbIL8-IV = 45.2 ± 0.9 kg/d) yields when compared with CTR cows, and no differences were observed between rbIL8-IV and CTR cows. The administration of rbIL8-IU significantly increased DMI compared with CTR (CTR = 18.8 ± 0.3; rbIL8-IU = 19.9 ± 0.3; rbIL8-IV = 19.3 ± 0.3 kg/d). Recombinant bIL-8 treatment did not affect glucose, , or fatty  (i.e., IVICT only) concentrations or their area under the curve in response to an intravenous glucose tolerance test and IVICT when compared with CTR. Moreover, rbIL-8 treatment administered IU or IV increased liver triglyceride levels. Additionally, cows treated with rbIL8-IU tended to have lower odds of developing hyperketonemia (odds ratio = 0.46, 95% confidence interval: 0.19 to 1.10), lower odds of clinical ketosis and displaced abomasum combined (odds ratio = 0.17, 95% confidence interval: 0.03 to 0.89), and lower odds of diseases combined (odds ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.21 to 0.86) when compared with CTR. We conclude that the administration of rbIL8-IU increases DMI, milk production, fat-corrected milk, and energy-corrected milk while improving overall health during the postpartum period. This study supports the use of rbIL-8 administered IU shortly after calving to improve health and production responses in lactating cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

MetS was defined using Chinese Diabetes Society's criteria. Logistic regression analysis was used to obtain odds ratios (OR) of determinants of MetS.  The overall prevalence of MetS was 66.5%, with the highest prevalence in T2DM (68.1%), followed by those in LADA (44.3%) and T1DM (34.2%) ( < 0.05 for all comparisons). After adjustment for traditional risk factors, T2DM had a 2.8-fold [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.36-3.37] MetS risk compared with LADA, whereas T1DM had significantly lower OR than LADA (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50-0.92). After further adjustment for , the OR of T2DM vs. LADA was slightly reduced but the OR of T1DM vs. LADA was greatly attenuated to non-significance (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.70-1.33). In addition to types of diabetes, age, gender, geographical residence, education attainment, alcohol consumption and HOMA2-IR were independent determinants of MetS.  MetS was highly prevalent, not only in T2DM but also in T1DM and LADA in Chinese newly diagnosed patients; higher risk of MetS in LADA than in T1DM was partially attributable to higher  in LADA.Copyright © 2019 Li, Cao, Tang, Yan, Zhou, Liu, Ji, Yang and Zhou.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31499737>Modeling the dynamics of glucose, , and free fatty  with time delay: The impact of bariatric surgery on type 2 diabetes mellitus.</a></h1><p>The role of free fatty  (FFA) on Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) progression has been studied extensively with prior studies suggesting that individuals with shared familial genetic predisposition to metabolic-related diseases may be vulnerable to dysfunctional plasma FFA regulation. A harmful cycle arises when FFA are not properly regulated by  contributing to the development of , a key indicator for T2DM, since prolonged  may lead to hyperglycemia. We introduce a hypothesis-driven dynamical model and use it to evaluate the role of FFA on  progression that is mathematically constructed within the context of individuals that have genetic predisposition to dysfunctional plasma FFA. The dynamics of the nonlinear interactions that involve glucose, , and FFA are modeled by incorporating a fixed-time delay with the corresponding delay-differential equations being studied numerically. The results of computational studies, that is, extensive simulations, are compared to the known minimal ordinary differential equations model. Parameter estimation and model validation are carried out using clinical data of patients who underwent bariatric surgery. These estimates provide a quantitative measure that is used to evaluate the regulation of lipolysis by  action measured by  sensitivity, within a metabolically heterogeneous population (non-diabetic to diabetic). Results show that key metabolic factors improve after surgery, such as the effect of  inhibition of FFA on  and glucose regulation, results that do match prior clinical studies. These findings indicate that the reduction in weight or body mass due to surgery improve  action for the regulation of glucose, FFA, and  levels. This reinforces what we know, namely, that  action is essential for regulating FFA and glucose levels and is a robust effect that can be observed not only in the long-term, but also in the short-term; thereby preventing the manifestation of T2DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552888>Protective effect of hydrogen sulfide on oxidative stress-induced neurodegenerative diseases.</a></h1><p>Hydrogen sulfide is an antioxidant molecule that has a wide range of biological effects against oxidative stress. Balanced oxidative stress is also vital for maintaining cellular function in biological system, where reactive oxygen species are the main source of oxidative stress. When the normal redox balance is disturbed, deoxyribonucleic , lipid, and protein molecules are oxidized under pathological conditions, like diabetes mellitus that leads to diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In diabetes mellitus-induced diabetic peripheral neuropathy, due to hyperglycemia, pancreatic beta cell (β cell) shows  to  secretion. As a consequence, glucose metabolism is disturbed in neuronal cells which are distracted from providing proper cell signaling pathway. Not only diabetic peripheral neuropathy but also other central damages occur in brain neuropathy. Neurological studies regarding type 1 diabetes mellitus patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have shown changes in the central nervous system because high blood glucose levels (HbA1c) appeared with poor cognitive function. Oxidative stress plays a role in inhibiting  signaling that is necessary for brain function. Hydrogen sulfide exhibits antioxidant effects against oxidative stress, where cystathionine β synthase, cystathionine γ lyase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase are the endogenous sources of hydrogen sulfide. This review is to explore the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus-induced diabetic peripheral neuropathy and other neurological comorbid disorders under the oxidative stress condition and the anti-oxidative effects of hydrogen sulfide.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626814>Mathematical model of diabetes and lipid metabolism.</a></h1><p>An original model of diabetes linked to carbohydrate and lipid intake is presented and applied to predict the effects on biomarkers of various diets. The variables (biomarkers) are concentrations of fasting plasma glucose, , leptin, glucagon, non-esterified fatty  (NEFA) and very low density lipoprotein triglyceride (VLDLTG), as well as muscle lipids, hepatic lipids, pancreatic lipids, fat mass and mass of β-cells. The model predicts isocaloric high carbohydrate low fat (HCLF) diet and low carbohydrate high fat (LCHF) diet trajectories to health which vary in fat mass by at most a few kilograms at steady state. The LCHF trajectories to health are faster than isocaloric HCLF trajectories with respect to fat mass loss, although these trajectories may be slower initially if parameters are adjusting from HCLF values. On LC diets, leptin sensitivity and VLDLTG clearance are thought to increase. Increasing leptin sensitivity and VLDLTG clearance is predicted to lower lipids including fat mass and VLDLTG. The model predicts that changes in VLDLTG due to a change in diet happen rapidly, approaching steady state values after a few weeks, reflecting leptin sensitivity and VLDLTG clearance which are much harder to measure. The model predicts that if only  sensitivity increases on a LC diet, steady state fat mass would increase slightly. If leptin and  sensitivities increase concurrently, the combined effect could be a decrease in fat mass, consistent with the fact that increasing  sensitivity is often associated with fat mass loss in trials. The model predicts trajectories to fat type II diabetes with hypertriglyceridemia due to high carbohydrate moderate fat diets, on which  rises before falling, as ectopic fat deposits increase; made fatter and more diabetic by higher lipid consumption. It predicts trajectories to non-diabetic states with raised fat mass, VLDLTG and muscle, hepatic and pancreatic lipids due to moderate carbohydrate high fat diets. The model predicts paths to lean type II diabetes, on a diet of moderate energy but low β-cell replication rate or high death rate.Copyright © 2019.

We investigated the effects of isocaloric isoproteic supplementation of either whey protein (WG) or hydrolysed collagen supplementation (CG) on dietary intake, adiposity and biochemical markers in overweight women.In this randomized double-blind study, 37 women, [mean ± SE, age 40.6 ± 1.7 year; BMI (kg/m) 30.9 ± 0.6], consumed sachets containing 40 g/day of concentrated whey protein (25 g total protein, 2.4 leucine, 1.0 valine, 1.5 isoleucine,  = 17) or 38 g/day of hydrolysed collagen (26 g total protein, 1.02 leucine, 0.91 valine, 0.53 isoleucine,  = 20) in the afternoon snack. The compliance was set at >70% of the total theoretical doses. The dietary intake was evaluated by a 6-day food record questionnaire. At the beginning and after eight weeks of follow-up, body composition was evaluated by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and lipid profile, , C-reactive protein, adiponectin, leptin and nesfastin plasma concentrations were analyzed.Supplements were isocaloric and isoproteic. There were no differences in caloric intake ( = 0.103), protein ( = 0.085), carbohydrate ( = 0.797) and lipids ( = 0.109) intakes. The branched chain amino  (BCAA) (GC: 1.8 ± 0.1 g vs. WG: 5.5 ± 0.3 g,  < 0.001) and leucine intake (CG: 0.1 ± 0.1 g vs. WG: 2.6 ± 0.1 g,  < 0.001) were higher in WG compared to CG. BMI increased in the CG (0.2 ± 1.1 kg/m,  = 0.044) but did not change in WG. WG decreased the android fat (-0.1 ± 0.3 kg,  = 0.031) and increased nesfatin concentrations (4.9 ± 3.2 ng/mL,  = 0.014) compared to CG.Whey protein supplementation in overweight women increased nesfatin concentrations and could promote increase of resting metabolic rate as part of body composition improvement programs compared to collagen supplementation for 8 weeks.

All the above precede the onset of full-blown type 2 diabetes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2016 more than 1.9 billion people over 18 years of age were overweight and about 600 million were obese. Currently, the primary hypothesis explaining the probability of occurrence of  assigns a fundamental role of lipids accumulation in adipocytes or nonadipose tissue (muscle, liver) and the locally developing chronic inflammation caused by adipocytes hypertrophy. However, the major molecular pathways are unknown. The sphingolipid ceramide is the main culprit that combines a plethora of nutrients (e.g., saturated fatty ) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFα) to the progression of . The accumulation of sphingolipid ceramide in tissues of obese humans, rodents and Western-diet non-human primates is in line with diabetes, hypertension, cardiac failure or atherosclerosis. In hypertrophied adipose tissue, after adipocytes excel their storage capacity, neutral lipids begin to accumulate in nonadipose tissues, inducing organ dysfunction. Furthermore, obesity is closely related to the development of chronic inflammation and the release of cytokines directly from adipocytes or from macrophages that infiltrate adipose tissue. Enzymes taking part in ceramide metabolism are potential therapeutic targets to manipulate sphingolipids content in tissues, either by inhibition of their synthesis or through stimulation of ceramides degradation. In this review, we will evaluate the mechanisms responsible for the development of  and possible therapeutic perspectives.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31435783>Circulatory miRNA biomarkers of metabolic syndrome.</a></h1><p>Circulatory microRNAs (c-miRNAs) exert important roles in the molecular dysregulation of cardio-metabolic diseases. However, little is known whether dysregulated miRNA expression occurs when risk factors are elevated, as in the metabolic syndrome (MetS). This study quantified c-miRNA expression in individuals with MetS compared to healthy, further examining the relationship of gene pathways with the underlying pathogenesis.Expression of 26 miRNAs was quantified in plasma from 40 women (20 healthy and 20 MetS) and 39 men (20 healthy and 19 MetS) by qPCR. In silico analysis was performed to investigate biological effects of the dysregulated miRNAs. Dysregulated miRNA expression was further validated in an independent cohort of 20 women (10 healthy and 10 MetS).Regression model adjusted for age and sex identified miR-15a-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-370-3p and miR-375 as important predictors of MetS presence. Analysis of predictive miRNAs in the validation cohort strengthened the relationship with miR-15a-5p and miR-17-5p expression. These miRNAs share genes involved in the regulation of metabolic pathways including , wnt, fatty  metabolism and AMPK.miR-15a-5p and miR-17-5p were identified as predictive biomarkers of MetS, irrespective of sexes, further demonstrating the relationship of c-miRNAs to known pathways of metabolic disturbances present in cardio-metabolic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646058>A Case of Treatment  and Complications in a Patient with Stiff Person Syndrome and Cerebellar Ataxia.</a></h1><p>Antibodies against glutamic  decarboxylase (GAD) are associated with Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS).A 50-year-old woman presented with symptoms progressed over 9 years, resulting in a cerebellar ataxia and right upper limb tremor.

Ingestion of taurine helps to improve obesity and its related metabolic disorders. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the protective role of taurine against obesity is not completely understood. In this study, it was found that intraperitoneal treatment of mice with taurine alleviated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, improved  sensitivity, and increased energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis of the mice. Meanwhile, administration of the mice with taurine markedly induced the browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) with significantly elevated expression of PGC1α, UCP1, and other thermogenic genes in iWAT.  studies indicated that taurine also induced the development of brown-like adipocytes in C3H10T1/2 white adipocytes. Knockdown of PGC1α blunted the role of taurine in promoting the brown-like adipocyte phenotypes in C3H10T1/2 cells. Moreover, taurine treatment enhanced AMPK phosphorylation  and , and knockdown of AMPKα1 prevented taurine-mediated induction of PGC1α in C3H10T1/2 cells. Consistently, specific knockdown of PGC1α in iWAT of the HFD-fed mice inhibited taurine-induced browning of iWAT, with the role of taurine in the enhancement of adaptive thermogenesis, the prevention of obesity, and the improvement of  sensitivity being partially impaired. These results reveal a functional role of taurine in facilitating the browning of white adipose tissue, which depends on the induction of PGC1α. Our studies also suggest a potential mechanism for the protective role of taurine against obesity, which involves taurine-mediated browning of white adipose tissue.© 2019 Guo et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540136>Liraglutide Inhibits Hepatitis C Virus Replication Through an AMP Activated Protein Kinase Dependent Mechanism.</a></h1><p> and diabetes are both associated with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and the glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) receptor agonist, liraglutide, is a common therapy for diabetes. Our aim was to investigate whether liraglutide treatment can inhibit HCV replication. A cell culture-produced HCV infectious system was generated by transfection of in vitro-transcribed genomic JFH-1 ribonucleic  (RNA) into Huh-7.5 cells. Total RNA samples were extracted to determine the efficiency of HCV replication. The Ava5 cells were treated with liraglutide and cell viability was calculated. A Western blot analysis of the protein expression was performed. The immunoreactive blot signals were also detected. Liraglutide activated GLP-1 receptors in the HCV infectious system, and inhibited subgenomic HCV RNA replication in the HuH-7.5 cells. The Western blot analysis revealed both HCV protein and replicon RNA were reduced after treatment with liraglutide in a dose-dependent manner. Liraglutide decreased the cell viability of HCV RNA at an optimum concentration of 120 μg/mL, activated the 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the phosphorylated- transducer of regulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (CAMP) response element-binding protein 2 (TORC2), thereby decreasing the cell viability of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and G6pase RNA Therefore, we conclude that liraglutide can inhibit HCV replication via an AMPK/TORC2-dependent pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667519>Short-term dietary reduction of branched-chain amino  reduces meal-induced  secretion and modifies microbiome composition in type 2 diabetes: a randomized controlled crossover trial.</a></h1><p>Epidemiological studies have shown that increased circulating branched-chain amino  (BCAAs) are associated with  and type 2 diabetes (T2D). This may result from altered energy metabolism or dietary habits.We hypothesized that a lower intake of BCAAs improves tissue-specific  sensitivity.This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial examined well-controlled T2D patients receiving isocaloric diets (protein: 1 g/kg body weight) for 4 wk. Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake. The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess  signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001). Under clamp conditions, whole-body and hepatic  sensitivity did not differ between diets. After the BCAA- diet, however, the oral glucose sensitivity index was 24% (P < 0.01) and circulating fibroblast-growth factor 21 was 21% higher (P < 0.05), whereas meal-derived  secretion was 28% lower (P < 0.05). Adipose tissue expression of the mechanistic target of rapamycin was 13% lower, whereas the mitochondrial respiratory control ratio was 1.7-fold higher (both P < 0.05). The fecal microbiome was enriched in Bacteroidetes but depleted of Firmicutes.Short-term dietary reduction of BCAAs decreases postprandial  secretion and improves white adipose tissue metabolism and gut microbiome composition.

Despite an accumulating number of studies, no pharmacotherapy that targets NAFLD has received general approval for clinical use.Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a promising approach to treat diabetes, obesity, and associated metabolic disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, on NAFLD and obesity-associated metabolic symptoms in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.Delayed intervention with NGI001 protected against body weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia, compared with HFD alone. Adipocyte hypertrophy was prevented by administering NGI001. NGI001 inhibited impaired glucose metabolism and regulated the secretion of adipokines associated with . In addition, NGI001 supplementation suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, and had little impact on kidney function. In-depth investigations showed NGI001 ameliorated fat deposition and increased AMPK phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of its major downstream target, ACC, in human hepatocytes, HuS-E/2 cells. This cascade ultimately led to the downregulation of downstream fatty  synthesis-related molecules and the upregulation of downstream β oxidation-associated molecules. Surprisingly, NGI001 decreased gene and protein expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and glucose uptake in oleic -treated HuS-E/2 cells.Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of the novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, to attenuate or delay the onset of diet-induced metabolic diseases and NAFLD.This article is protected by copyright.

Importantly, data among pregnant women are scarce. We investigated individual plasma phospholipid n-3 and n-6 PUFAs in early to midpregnancy in relation to subsequent risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).Within the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Fetal Growth Studies-Singleton Cohort (n = 2,802), individual plasma phospholipid n-3 and n-6 PUFAs levels were measured at gestational weeks (GWs) 10-14, 15-26, 23-31, and 33-39 among 107 GDM cases (ascertained on average at GW 27) and 214 non-GDM controls. Conditional logistic regression was used, adjusting for major risk factors for GDM. After adjusting for covariates, individual n-3 eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were inversely correlated with  markers, whereas individual n-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic  (DGLA) was positively correlated with  markers. At GW 15-26, a standard deviation (SD) increase in total n-3 PUFAs and individual n-3 DPA was associated with a 36% (adjusted odds ratio 0.64; 95% CI 0.42-0.96; P = 0.042) and 33% (0.67; 95% CI 0.45-0.99; P = 0.047) lower risk of GDM, respectively; however, the significance did not persist after post hoc false-discovery rate (FDR) correction (FDR-corrected P values > 0.05). Associations between total n-6 PUFAs and GDM were null, whereas associations with individual n-6 PUFAs were differential. Per SD increase, gamma-linolenic  (GLA) at GWs 10-14 and DGLA at GWs 10-14 and 15-26 were significantly associated with a 1.40- to 1.95-fold higher risk of GDM, whereas docosatetraenoic  (DTA) at GW 15-26 was associated with a 45% (0.55; 95% CI 0.37-0.83) lower risk of GDM (all FDR-corrected P values < 0.05). Null associations were observed for linoleic  (LA) in either gestational window in relation to risk of GDM. Women with high (≥median) n-3 PUFAs and low (<median) n-6 PUFAs levels had a 64% (95% CI 0.14-0.95; P value = 0.039) lower risk of GDM versus women with low n-3 and high n-6 PUFAs. Limitations include the inability to distinguish between exogenous and endogenous influences on circulating PUFA levels and the lack of causality inherent in observational studies.Our findings may suggest a potential role of primarily endogenously metabolized plasma phospholipid n-6 PUFAs including GLA, DGLA, and DTA in early to midpregnancy in the development of GDM. Null findings on primarily diet-derived n-3 EPA and DHA and n-6 LA do not provide strong evidence to suggest a beneficial role in prevention of GDM, although not excluding the potential benefit of EPA and DHA on glucose- homeostasis given the inverse associations with  markers.

The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the energy status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by  and amino  availability, and its metabolic actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing  to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino  supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; 2) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In these mice, GA effectively lowered fasting blood glucose concentrations from 26.3 ± 4.09 to 17.4 ± 3.38 mmol L, and improved oral glucose and  tolerance. Furthermore, GA treatment accelerated lipid transport and promoted fatty  oxidation, which reduced lipid accumulation and inhibited expression of inflammatory cytokines, including those involved in the proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ)- and nuclear factor κB (NFκB)-mediated signaling pathways. In addition, the anti-inflammatory effects increased the ratio of  to glucagon.

Moreover, dysbiotic gut microbiota has been suggested to promote systemic low-grade inflammation and  through the release of endotoxins particularly lipopolysaccharides. We have previously shown that exercise training improves intestinal metabolism in healthy men. To understand whether changes in intestinal metabolism interact with gut microbiota and its release of inflammatory markers, we studied the effects of sprint interval (SIT) and moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) on intestinal metabolism and microbiota in .Twenty-six, sedentary subjects (prediabetic n=9, T2D n=17; age 49[SD 4] years; BMI 30.5[SD 3]) were randomized into SIT or MICT. Intestinal -stimulated glucose uptake (GU) and fatty  uptake (FAU) from circulation were measured using PET. Gut microbiota composition was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and serum inflammatory markers with multiplex assays and enzyme-linked immunoassay kit.VO2peak improved only after SIT (p=0.01). Both training modes reduced systematic and intestinal inflammatory markers (TNF α, LBP) (time p<0.05). Training modified microbiota profile by increasing Bacteroidetes phylum (time p=0.03) and decreasing Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio (time p=0.04). Moreover, there was a decrease in Clostridium genus (time p=0.04) and Blautia (time p=0.051). Only MICT decreased jejunal FAU (p=0.02). Training had no significant effect on intestinal GU. Colonic GU associated positively with Bacteroidetes and inversely with Firmicutes phylum, ratio Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes and Blautia genus.Intestinal substrate uptake associates with gut microbiota composition and activity and whole-body  sensitivity.

The pre-diabetic rats were then treated with OA (80 mg/kg) or metformin (500 mg/kg) in the presence and absence of dietary interventions for a period of 12 weeks. The effects of OA were evaluated on parameters including plasma triglycerides (TGs), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, bilirubin, AST, ALT, SREBP and antioxidant profile while the livers were collected for histological analysis.The findings of this study showed that the administration of OA to pre-diabetic rats ameliorated body/liver weights ratio and significantly decreased plasma triglycerides (TGs) and VLDL. Furthermore, OA also ameliorated hepatic oxidative stress, lowered the SREBP expression and intrahepatic TGs. In addition, OA administration decreased plasma concentrations of bilirubin and liver damage enzyme biomarkers.The findings of the study suggest that OA ameliorates the risk of developing pre-diabetes-related NAFLD through the prevention of intrahepatic fat accumulation while also lowering hepatic inflammation.© 2019 Gamede et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557503>Protocatechuic  exhibits hepatoprotective, vasculoprotective, antioxidant and -like effects in dexamethasone-induced -resistant rats.</a></h1><p>Protocatechuic  (PCA), the natural phenolic antioxidant, reportedly exhibited hypoglycemic and -like effects. Recent studies have reported its cardioprotective effect in glucocorticoid (GC)-induced hypertensive rats. Nevertheless, its beneficial role has not been investigated in the setting of GCs excess-induced . This study aimed to investigate the possible protective potential and the plausible mechanisms of pretreatment with PCA against GCs-induced , liver steatosis and vascular dysfunction.  was induced in male Wistar rats by a 7-day treatment with dexamethasone (DEX) (1 mg/kg/day, i.p.). PCA (50, 100 mg/kg/day, orally) was started 7 days before DEX administration and continued during the test period. PCA significantly and dose-dependently attenuated DEX-induced a) glucose intolerance (↓ AUC), b) hyperglycemia (↓ fasting blood glucose), c) impaired  sensitivity [↓fasting plasma  and homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) index)] and d) dyslipidemia (↓total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol). PCA mitigated DEX-induced liver steatosis with associated reduction in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity. Moreover, PCA ameliorated DEX-induced vascular dysfunction and enhanced ACh-induced relaxation in aortic rings. The metabolic ameliorating effects of PCA might be attributed to the enhanced  signaling in soleus muscles (↑AKT phosphorylation) and mitigating gluconeogenesis (↓ hepatic mRNA expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). The vasculoprotective effect of PCA might be related to its ability to restore normal mRNA expression of [endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and NADPH Oxidase 4 (NOX4)]. PCA restored normal oxidative balance [↓ oxidant species, malondialdehyde (MDA) and (↑ antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD)]. The findings herein reveal for the first time that PCA may be taken as a supplement with GCs to limit their metabolic and vascular side effects through its hypoglycemic, -sensitizing, hypolipidemic and antioxidant effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Gut microbiota is influenced by maternal factors, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Our aim was to explore the effects of maternal high-fat feeding on the relationship linking gut microbiota and cognitive development in the offspring. Murine offspring born to dams undergoing normal diet (NDm) and high-fat diet (HFDm) were studied at 1 or 6 months of age to assess cognitive function by Y-maze test, cerebral glucose metabolism and  sensitivity by Positron Emission Tomography, brain density by Computed Tomography, microbiota profile (colon, caecum) and inferred metabolic pathways (KEGG analysis) by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. From 3 weeks post-weaning, mice born to HFDm developed hyperphagia and overweight, showing reduction in memory and exploratory behaviour, and brain  in adulthood. We identified a panel of bacteria characterizing offspring born to HFD dams from early life, and correlating with dysfunction in memory and exploratory behaviour in adults (including Proteobacteria phylum, Parabacteroides and unclassified Rikenellaceae genera). Microbiota-derived metabolic pathways involved in fatty , essential aminoacid and vitamin processing, sulphur metabolism, glutaminergic activation and Alzheimer's disease were differently present in the HFDm and NDm offspring groups. Our results document tight relationships between gut dysbiosis and memory and behavioural impairment in relation to maternal HFD. Persistent bacterial signatures induced by maternal HFD during infancy can influence cognition during adulthood, opening the possibility of microbiota-targeted strategies to contrast cognitive decline.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31530015>NDUFAB1 protects against obesity and  by enhancing mitochondrial metabolism.</a></h1><p>Mitochondria are fundamental organelles for cellular and systemic metabolism, and their dysfunction has been implicated in the development of diverse metabolic diseases. Boosted mitochondrial metabolism might be able to protect against metabolic stress and prevent metabolic disorders. Here we show that NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDU)-FAB1, also known as mitochondrial acyl carrier protein, acts as a novel enhancer of mitochondrial metabolism and protects against obesity and . Mechanistically, NDUFAB1 coordinately enhances lipoylation and activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase mediated by the mitochondrial fatty  synthesis pathway and increases the assembly of respiratory complexes and supercomplexes. Skeletal muscle-specific ablation of NDUFAB1 causes systemic disruption of glucose homeostasis and defective  signaling, leading to growth arrest and early death within 5 postnatal days. In contrast, NDUFAB1 overexpression effectively protects mice against obesity and  when the animals are challenged with a high-fat diet.

Mechanism of the high association of metabolic syndrome with the use of atypical antipsychotics is not clear. Literature and our data suggest that chronic inflammation- or stress-induced dysregulation of the peripheral down-stream kynurenine (Kyn) metabolism, shared by both Sz and metabolic syndrome, contributes to the development of metabolic syndrome in Sz patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Correction of dysregulation of the peripheral down-stream metabolism of Kyn would prevent/treat metabolic syndrome. This is a pre-clinical trial of the effect of benserazide (BRZ), an inhibitor of the key enzymes of Kyn metabolism, on olanzapine-induced mouse model of metabolic syndrome. Olanzapine is one of the most effective atypical antipsychotics but has high potential to induce metabolic syndrome.

Forty Sprague-Daley rats were equally categorized into control, exercise, seaweed, and exercise plus seaweed (ES) groups. Rats in respective groups performed RE (once per 2 days) or received seaweed (250 mg/kg bodyweight, orally) for 10 weeks. Results showed that seaweed consumption in combination with RE significantly ( < 0.05) increased maximal weight carrying capacity compared to RE alone. FHL muscle mass was significantly higher in both exercise and ES groups. Notably, high-intensity RE-induced lipid peroxidation, as evidenced by elevated thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) in muscle, was substantially diminished ( < 0.05) by seaweed treatment. This antioxidative effect of seaweed was further represented by augmented superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione levels in seaweed groups. We noticed increased  concentrations and HOMA-IR, while the fasting blood glucose levels remained stable in seaweed and ES groups. Our findings conclude that seaweed in combination with RE enhanced maximal carrying strength and attenuated oxidative stress through improved antioxidant capacity.

However, studies on the effects of myricitrin on obesity are limited. We hypothesized that dietary myricitrin would attenuate the adiposity and metabolic dysfunction that occur in obesity. To test this hypothesis, mice were randomly fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD supplemented with myricitrin for 16 weeks. Myricitrin significantly reduced white adipose tissue (WAT) mass, adipocyte size, and plasma leptin levels, and also attenuated dyslipidemia. These changes appeared to result from increased energy expenditure and activation of the carnitine acyltransferase (CPT) and -oxidation in WAT. Expressions of the proinflammatory genes , , , and  were also lower in the WAT of myricitrin-supplemented mice. Moreover, myricitrin markedly reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation and plasma aspartate transaminase levels by increasing CPT activity and reducing fatty  synthase activity in the liver. Myricitrin-supplemented mice also showed improved glucose tolerance,  sensitivity, and decreased hyperinsulinemia, along with decreased levels of circulating resistin. In conclusion, long-term consumption of a myricitrin-supplemented diet may effectively protect against HFD-induced obesity and related metabolic disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623832>The saturated fatty  palmitate induces  through Smad3-mediated down-regulation of FNDC5 in myotubes.</a></h1><p>Elevated plasma free fatty  (FFA) levels are associated with  and can cause lipotoxicity in skeletal muscles. In response to FFAs, skeletal muscle can secrete a variety of cytokines. Irisin, one such muscle-secreted cytokine, can improve glucose tolerance, glucose uptake, and lipid metabolism. It is produced by the transmembrane protein fibronectin type Ⅲ domain containing 5 (FNDC5) by specific proteases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the FNDC5 response to palmitate and their relationships with  in C2C12 myotubes. RNA sequencing analysis results from C2C12 myotubes treated with palmitate showed that palmitate could activate the TGF-β signaling pathway. Palmitate directly affected the expression of Smad3, but not its phosphorylation level, in C2C12 myotubes. Furthermore, knockdown and knockout of Smad3 alleviated the inhibitory effect of palmitate on the expression of FNDC5. In contrast, overexpression of Smad3 aggravated the inhibition of FNDC5 expression. There is a Smad3 binding motif in the -660 bp to -649 bp region of the Fndc5 promoter. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of this region also alleviated the inhibition of FNDC5 expression in response to palmitate. More importantly, inhibition of FNDC5 expression mediated by Smad3 led to a decrease in  sensitivity in C2C12 myotubes. Collectively, these findings suggest that palmitate could induce  through Smad3-mediated down-regulation of the Fndc5 gene.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

While the mechanisms regulating macrophage recruitment in obesity have been delineated, the signals directing macrophage persistence in VAT are poorly understood. We previously showed that the neuroimmune guidance cue netrin-1 is expressed in the VAT of obese mice and humans, where it promotes macrophage accumulation. To better understand the source of netrin-1 and its effects on adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) fate and function in obesity, we generated mice with myeloid-specific deletion of netrin-1 (   ; Ntn1). Interestingly, Ntn1 mice showed a modest decrease in HFD-induced adiposity and adipocyte size, in the absence of changes in food intake or leptin, that was accompanied by an increase in markers of adipocyte beiging (, UCP-1). Using single cell RNA-seq, combined with conventional histological and flow cytometry techniques, we show that myeloid-specific deletion of netrin-1 caused a 50% attrition of ATMs in HFD-fed mice, particularly of the resident macrophage subset, and altered the phenotype of residual ATMs to enhance lipid handling. Pseudotime analysis of single cell transcriptomes showed that in the absence of netrin-1, macrophages in the obese VAT underwent a phenotypic switch with the majority of ATMs activating a program of genes specialized in lipid handling, including fatty  uptake and intracellular transport, lipid droplet formation and lipolysis, and regulation of lipid localization. Furthermore, Ntn1 macrophages had reduced expression of genes involved in arachidonic  metabolism, and targeted LCMS/MS metabololipidomics analysis revealed decreases in proinflammatory eicosanoids (5-HETE, 6- LTB, TXB, PGD) in the obese VAT. Collectively, our data show that targeted deletion of netrin-1 in macrophages reprograms the ATM phenotype in obesity, leading to reduced adipose inflammation, and improved lipid handling and metabolic function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660472>Three Novel Mutations I65S, R66S, and G86R Divulge Significant Conformational Variations in the PTB Domain of the IRS1 Gene.</a></h1><p> receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) is one of the major substrates for the IR, and their interaction mediates several downstream  signaling pathways.

Hepatic  can result in increased release of glucose (from gluconeogenesis) and free fatty  (due to enhanced lipolysis), which can lead in turn to fetal overgrowth. However, the relationship between maternal metabolic factors (such as circulating levels of triglycerides, free fatty  [FFA], or adipokines) and excessive fetal birthweight in NAFLD has not been carefully examined. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between NAFLD and the subsequent risk of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) birthweight.Singleton nondiabetic pregnant women were evaluated for the presence of fatty liver at 10-14 weeks of gestation by abdominal ultrasound. The degree of fatty liver was classified as Grade 0-3 steatosis. At the time of liver ultrasound, maternal blood was taken after fasting and measured for adiponectin and FFA. LGA was defined as birthweight >90th percentile for gestational age.A total of 623 women were included in the analysis. The frequency of LGA was 10.9% (68/623), and the frequency of NAFLD was 18.9%. The risk of LGA increased significantly in patients with Grade 2-3 steatosis in the first trimester. The relationship between Grade 2-3 steatosis and LGA remained significant after adjustment for maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, GDM, and maternal serum triglyceride levels. The concentration of maternal blood adiponectin at 10-14 weeks was significantly lower in cases with LGA than non-LGA, but the maternal blood FFA concentrations were not different between the groups.The presence of Grade 2-3 steatosis on ultrasound in early pregnancy was associated with the increased risk of delivering an LGA infant, even after adjustment for multiple confounding factors including GDM.

Increased oxidative stress in adipose tissue contributes to the development of  and metabolic syndrome in obesity. The present study aimed to investigate the role of peroxisomal fitness in maintaining adipocyte function, which has been underrated in the obesity research area.Reduced peroxisomal gene expressions in white adipose tissue (WAT) of obese mice suggested a close correlation between peroxisomes and obesity. Pex5 siRNA increased cellular ROS and inflammatory mediators in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. On the other hands, H2O2 or TNFα treatment significantly decreased biogenesis- and function-related peroxisomal proteins, suggesting a positive feedback loop of ROS/inflammation and peroxisomal dysfunction. Correspondingly, catalase (a major peroxisomal antioxidant)-knockout mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) exhibited suppressed peroxisomal proteins along with increased oxidative stress and accelerated obesity. In response to fenofibrate (a peroxisomal proliferator) treatment, WAT of HFD-fed wild type mice showed not only increases in peroxisomal biogenesis and fatty  oxidation, but also attenuated features of adipocyte dysfunction and obesity. However, these results were not observed in PPAR-α null obese mice.

The antidiabetic mechanism of FJG may be related to regulation of the -signaling pathway in skeletal muscle.

In the present study, we generated mice lacking the  gene, which encodes an essential scaffold subunit of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex in adipose tissues (-AKO mice) and we examined the role of CCR4-NOT in adipocyte function. -AKO mice showed reduced masses of white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), indicating abnormal organization and function of those tissues. Indeed, -AKO mice showed hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, , and glucose intolerance and they could not maintain a normal body temperature during cold exposure. Muscle-like fibrous material appeared in both WAT and BAT of -AKO mice, suggesting the acquisition of non-adipose tissue characteristics. Gene expression analysis using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that the levels of adipose tissue-related mRNAs, including those of metabolic genes, decreased, whereas the levels of inflammatory response-related mRNAs increased. These data suggest that the CCR4-NOT complex ensures proper adipose tissue function by maintaining adipocyte-specific mRNAs at appropriate levels and by simultaneously suppressing mRNAs that would impair adipocyte function if overexpressed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676981>Circulating palmitoleic  is an independent determinant of  sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals: a longitudinal analysis.</a></h1><p>Experimental studies suggest that the fatty  palmitoleate may act as an adipocyte-derived lipid hormone (or 'lipokine') to regulate systemic metabolism. We investigated the relationship of circulating palmitoleate with  sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in humans.Plasma NEFA concentration and composition were determined in non-diabetic individuals from the Relationship between  Sensitivity and Cardiovascular disease (RISC) study cohort at baseline (n = 1234) and after a 3 year follow-up (n = 924). Glucose tolerance,  secretion and beta cell function were assessed during an OGTT. Whole-body  sensitivity was measured by a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (M/I) and OGTT (oral glucose  sensitivity index [OGIS]). The liver  index was calculated using clinical and biochemical data. Body composition including fat mass was determined by bioelectrical impedance.Circulating palmitoleate was proportional to fat mass (r = 0.21, p < 0.0001) and total NEFA levels (r = 0.19, p < 0.0001). It correlated with whole-body  sensitivity (M/I: standardised regression coefficient [std. β] = 0.16, p < 0.0001), liver  (std. β = -0.14, p < 0.0001), beta cell function (potentiation: std. β = 0.08, p = 0.045) and glucose tolerance (2 h glucose: std. β = -0.24, p < 0.0001) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, adiposity and other NEFA. High palmitoleate concentrations prevented the decrease in  sensitivity associated with excess palmitate (p = 0.0001). In a longitudinal analysis, a positive independent relationship was observed between changes in palmitoleate and  sensitivity over time (std. β = 0.07, p = 0.04).We demonstrated that plasma palmitoleate is an independent determinant of  sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals. These results support the role of palmitoleate as a beneficial lipokine released by adipose tissue to prevent the negative effects of adiposity and excess NEFA on systemic glucose metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652837>Deregulated Lysophosphatidic  Metabolism and Signaling in Liver Cancer.</a></h1><p>Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide due to late diagnosis and scarcity of treatment options. The major risk factor for liver cancer is cirrhosis with the underlying causes of cirrhosis being viral infection (hepatitis B or C), metabolic deregulation (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the presence of obesity and diabetes), alcohol or cholestatic disorders. Lysophosphatidic  (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid with numerous effects, most of them compatible with the hallmarks of cancer (proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, evasion of apoptosis, deregulated metabolism, neoangiogenesis, etc.). Autotaxin (ATX) is the enzyme responsible for the bulk of extracellular LPA production, and together with LPA signaling is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, fibrosis and cancer. This review discusses the most important findings and the mechanisms related to ATX/LPA/LPAR involvement on metabolic, viral and cholestatic liver disorders and their progression to liver cancer in the context of human patients and mouse models. It focuses on the role of ATX/LPA in NAFLD development and its progression to liver cancer as NAFLD has an increasing incidence which is associated with the increasing incidence of liver cancer. Bearing in mind that adipose tissue accounts for the largest amount of LPA production, many studies have implicated LPA in adipose tissue metabolism and inflammation, liver steatosis, , glucose intolerance and lipogenesis. At the same time, LPA and ATX play crucial roles in fibrotic diseases. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually developed on the background of liver fibrosis, therapies that both delay the progression of fibrosis and prevent its development to malignancy would be very promising. Therefore, ATX/LPA signaling appears as an attractive therapeutic target as evidenced by the fact that it is involved in both liver fibrosis progression and liver cancer development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630283>Beneficial effect of ER stress preconditioning in protection against FFA-induced adipocyte inflammation via XBP1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.</a></h1><p>Adipose tissue inflammation is closely associated with the development of obesity and . Free fatty  (FFAs) are a major inducer of obesity-related . Previously, we reported that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress potentially mediated retinal inflammation in diabetic retinopathy. The unfolded protein response (UPR) protects cells against damage induced by oxidative stress. X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) plays a major role in protecting cells by modulating the UPR. However, the link between ER stress and adipocyte inflammation has been poorly investigated. In the present study, we found that pretreatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with a low dose of ER stress inducer tunicamycin inhibited FFA-induced upregulated expression of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, FFAs induced phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB was largely inhibited by pretreatment with tunicamycin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Knockdown of XBP1 by siRNA markedly mitigated the protective effects of preconditioning against inflammation. Conversely, overexpression of XBP1 alleviated FFA-induced phosphorylation of IκB-α, IKKα/β, and NF-κB, which was accompanied by decreased inflammatory cytokine expression. Collectively, these results imply a beneficial role of ER stress preconditioning in protecting against FFA-induced 3T3-L1 adipocyte inflammation, which is likely mediated through inhibition of the IKK/NF-κB pathway via XBP1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663815>Preventive Action of Sterculic Oil on Metabolic Syndrome Development on a Fructose-Induced Rat Model.</a></h1><p>The metabolic syndrome (MS) underlies metabolic disorders considered risk factors for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in most of the world. Sterculic  has been proposed as a potential tool for the treatment of MS since it inhibits the activity of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a central enzyme in lipid metabolism. We analyzed the effect of sterculic oil (SO) co-administration with 30% fructose in drinking water on the development of MS in male Wistar rats. After 8 weeks, 0.4% SO exerted a protective effect from MS development since parameters altered by fructose (blood pressure, , serum glucose and triglycerides, steatosis, and adiposity) were similar to those of control rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443599>TNF-α in Combination with Palmitate Enhances IL-8 Production via The MyD88- Independent TLR4 Signaling Pathway: Potential Relevance to Metabolic Inflammation.</a></h1><p>Elevated levels of IL-8 (CXCL8) in obesity have been linked with  and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The mechanisms that lead to the profound production of IL-8 in obesity remains to be understood. TNF-α and saturated free fatty  (FFAs) are increased in obese humans and correlate with . Hence, we sought to investigate whether the cooccurrence of TNF-α and FFAs led to increase the production of IL-8 by human monocytes. We found that co-stimulation of human monocytes with palmitate and TNF-α led to increased IL-8 production as compared to those stimulated with palmitate or TNF-α alone. The synergistic production of IL-8 by TNF-α/palmitate was suppressed by neutralizing anti- Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) antibody and by genetic silencing of TLR4. Both MyD88-deficient and MyD88-competent cells responded comparably to TNF-α/Palmitate. However, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon (TRIF) inhibition or interferon regulatory transcription factor 3 (IRF3) knockdown partly blocked the synergistic production of IL-8. Our human data show that increased adipose tissue TNF-α expression correlated positively with IL-8 expression ( = 0.49,  = 0.001). IL-8 and TNF-α correlated positively with macrophage markers including CD68, CD163 and CD86 in adipose tissue. These findings suggest that the signaling cross-talk between saturated fatty  palmitate and TNF-α may be a key driver in obesity-associated chronic inflammation via an excessive production of IL-8.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518760>Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of novel dual FFA1 (GPR40)/PPARδ agonists as potential anti-diabetic agents.</a></h1><p>The free fatty  receptor 1 (FFA1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) were considered as potential anti-diabetic targets, and the dual FFA1/PPARδ agonists might provide synergistic effect in  secretion and sensibility. Herein, we further develop dual agonists by screening 7 series of heterocycles, resulting in the discovery of compound 19 with considerable oral pharmacokinetic profile. Compound 19 exhibited a balanced potency between FFA1 and PPARδ, and high selectivity over PPARα and PPARγ.

C57BL/6 type 8 week-old male mice (n = 10/per group) were fed with standard chow or three isocaloric diets consisting fructose, monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA), or saturated fatty  (SFA) for 15 weeks. After the dietary manipulation, the mice were sacrificed, tissues and blood were collected. Consequently, body weight gains, liver weights, and plasma homeostasis model of assessment- (HOMA-IR) values in were at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). The plasma concentrations of the non-esterified fatty  (NEFA), triglyceride (TG), and liver steatosis were found to be at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC1),  receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) in the liver were affected by the intake of SFA and fructose. Furthermore, the plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) and the thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) in the liver were elevated in SFA and fructose group (p < 0.05). The plasma level of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL -10) was found to be lower in the SFA group compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the inflammation and oxidation are related with the fatty - and fructose-induced impaired  signaling and fat accumulation in liver. Hence, in order to decrease the oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory response, it is substantial to reduce the saturated fat and added sugar or to replace with the unsaturated fat and complex carbohydrates in diet.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether epigenetics and environmental factors interact to promote progressive NAFLD during IR. We examined the miRNA signature in  receptor haploinsufficient (InsR+/-) and wild-type (wt) HSCs by RNAseq ( = 4 per group). Then, we evaluated their impact in an IR-NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) model (InsR+/- mice fed standard or methionine choline deficient (MCD) diet,  = 10 per group) and in vitro. InsR+/- HSCs displayed 36 differentially expressed miRNAs ( < 0.05 vs. wt), whose expression was then analyzed in the liver of InsR+/- mice fed an MCD diet. We found that miR-101-3p negatively associated with both InsR+/- genotype and MCD ( < 0.05) and the histological spectrum of liver damage ( < 0.01). miR-101-3p was reduced in InsR+/- hepatocytes and HSCs and even more in InsR+/- cells exposed to  (0.33 µM) and fatty  (0.25 mM), resembling the IR-NASH model. Conversely,  induced miR-101-3p expression in wt cells but not in InsR+/- ones ( < 0.05). In conclusion, IR combined with diet-induced liver injury favors miR-101-3p downregulation, which may promote progressive NAFLD through HSC and hepatocyte transdifferentiation and proliferation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615571>Fatty , epigenetic mechanisms and chronic diseases: a systematic review.</a></h1><p>Chronic illnesses like obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases, are worldwide major causes of morbidity and mortality. These pathological conditions involve interactions between environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors. Recent advances in nutriepigenomics are contributing to clarify the role of some nutritional factors, including dietary fatty  in gene expression regulation. This systematic review assesses currently available information concerning the role of the different fatty  on epigenetic mechanisms that affect the development of chronic diseases or induce protective effects on metabolic alterations.A targeted search was conducted in the PubMed/Medline databases using the keywords "fatty  and epigenetic". The data were analyzed according to the PRISMA-P guidelines.Consumption fatty  like n-3 PUFA: EPA and DHA, and MUFA: oleic and palmitoleic  was associated with an improvement of metabolic alterations. On the other hand, fatty  that have been associated with the presence or development of obesity, T2D, pro-inflammatory profile, atherosclerosis and IR were n-6 PUFA, saturated fatty  (stearic and palmitic), and trans fatty  (elaidic), have been also linked with epigenetic changes.Fatty  can regulate gene expression by modifying epigenetic mechanisms and consequently result in positive or negative impacts on metabolic outcomes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555072>Type-2-Diabetes Alters CSF but Not Plasma Metabolomic and AD Risk Profiles in Vervet Monkeys.</a></h1><p>Epidemiological studies suggest that individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have a twofold to fourfold increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, the exact mechanisms linking the two diseases are unknown. In both conditions, the majority of pathophysiological changes, including glucose and  dysregulation, , and AD-related changes in Aβ and tau, occur decades before the onset of clinical symptoms and diagnosis. In this study, we investigated the relationship between metabolic biomarkers associated with T2D and amyloid pathology including Aβ levels, from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and fasting plasma of healthy, pre-diabetic (PreD), and T2D vervet monkeys (). Consistent with the human disease, T2D monkeys have increased plasma and CSF glucose levels as they transition from normoglycemia to PreD and diabetic states. Although plasma levels of acylcarnitines and amino  remained largely unchanged, peripheral hyperglycemia correlated with decreased CSF acylcarnitines and CSF amino , including branched chain amino  (BCAA) concentrations, suggesting profound changes in cerebral metabolism coincident with systemic glucose dysregulation. Moreover, CSF Aβ  and CSF Aβ  levels decreased in T2D monkeys, a phenomenon observed in the human course of AD which coincides with increased amyloid deposition within the brain. In agreement with previous studies in mice, CSF Aβ  and CSF Aβ  were highly correlated with CSF glucose levels, suggesting that glucose levels in the brain are associated with changes in Aβ metabolism. Interestingly, CSF Aβ  and CSF Aβ  levels were also highly correlated with plasma but not CSF lactate levels, suggesting that plasma lactate might serve as a potential biomarker of disease progression in AD. Moreover, CSF glucose and plasma lactate levels were correlated with CSF amino  and acylcarnitine levels, demonstrating alterations in cerebral metabolism occurring with the onset of T2D. Together, these data suggest that peripheral metabolic changes associated with the development of T2D produce alterations in brain metabolism that lead to early changes in the amyloid cascade, similar to those observed in pre-symptomatic AD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31489455>Mechanisms of hyperinsulinaemia in apparently healthy non-obese young adults: role of  secretion, clearance and action and associations with plasma amino .</a></h1><p>This study aimed to examine the metabolic health of young apparently healthy non-obese adults to better understand mechanisms of hyperinsulinaemia.Non-obese (BMI < 30 kg/m) adults aged 18-35 years (N = 254) underwent a stable isotope-labelled OGTT.  sensitivity, glucose effectiveness and beta cell function were determined using oral minimal models. Individuals were stratified into quartiles based on their  response during the OGTT, with quartile 1 having the lowest and quartile 4 the highest responses.Thirteen per cent of individuals had impaired fasting glucose (IFG; n = 14) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; n = 19), allowing comparisons across the continuum of  responses within the spectrum of normoglycaemia and prediabetes. BMI (~24 kg/m) was similar across  quartiles and in those with IFG and IGT. Despite similar glycaemic excursions, fasting , triacylglycerols and cholesterol were elevated in quartile 4.  sensitivity was lowest in quartile 4, and accompanied by increased  secretion and reduced  clearance. Individuals with IFG had similar  sensitivity and beta cell function to those in quartiles 2 and 3, but were more  sensitive than individuals in quartile 4.

Plasma branched-chain amino  were not elevated in quartile 4, IFG or IGT.Hyperinsulinaemia within normoglycaemic young, non-obese adults manifests due to increased  secretion and reduced  clearance. Individual phenotypic characterisation revealed that the most hyperinsulinaemic were more similar to individuals with IGT than IFG, suggesting that hyperinsulinaemic individuals may be on the continuum toward IGT.

It included patients with biopsy-proven NASH. The patients were randomized into three groups: NAC (1.2 g) + UDCA (15 mg/kg) + MTF (850-1500 mg/day) (n=26); UDCA (20 mg/kg) + MTF (850-1500 mg/day) (n=13); NAC (1.2g) + MTF (850-1500 mg/day) (n=14) for 48 weeks. Clinical, laboratory and the second liver biopsies were performed after 48 weeks.A total of 53 patients were evaluated; 17 (32.1%) were males; median age ±54 (IQR=15, 21-71) years. In the baseline, no difference was seen between groups according clinical and histological parameters. The groups differed only in cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides. No significant differences in biochemical and histologic parameters were found between these the three groups after 48 weeks of treatment. In the intragroup analysis (intention-to-treat) comparing histological and biochemical features, there were significant improvements in the steatosis degree (P=0.014), ballooning (0.027) and, consequently, in the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) (P=0.005), and in the ALT levels at the end of the treatment only in the NAC + MTF group. No significant evidence of modification in the liver fibrosis could be observed in any of the groups.This multicenter study suggests that the association of NAC + MTF could reduce the liver disease activity in patients with NASH.

We report that, and show how, the anti-lipolytic effect of  can be fully explained by protein kinase B (PKB/Akt)-dependent activation of the phosphodiesterase PDE3B. Through the same PKB-dependent pathway β-adrenergic receptor signalling, via cAMP and PI3Kα, is anti-lipolytic and inhibits its own stimulation of lipolysis by 50%. Through this pathway both  and β-adrenergic signalling control phosphorylation of FOXO1. The dose-response of lipolysis is bell-shaped, such that  is anti-lipolytic at low concentrations, but at higher concentrations of  lipolysis was increasingly restored due to inhibition of PDE3B. The control of lipolysis was not altered in adipocytes from diabetic individuals. However, the release of fatty  was increased by 50% in diabetes due to reduced reesterification of lipolytically liberated fatty . In conclusion, our results reveal mechanisms of control by  and β-adrenergic stimulation - in human adipocytes - that define a network of checks and balances ensuring robust control to secure uninterrupted supply of fatty  without reaching concentrations that put cellular integrity at risk.

To assess cell proliferation and determine the optimal BP concentration, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) were treated with BPs at various relatively low concentrations (10 mmol/L) for different periods of time. Our in vitro study results demonstrated that BP application reversed the process by which high glucose inhibits bone formation and stimulates bone resorption through osteoclast-specific gene and protein expression (P<0.05). In vivo, fat accumulation and  were induced in T2DM rats. We used crosslinked hyaluronic  as the drug delivery vehicle for BPs to ensure that BPs administered at a dose of 30 µg/kg could settle into the prepared hole in rats. Thereafter, implants were inserted into cylindrical holes of a specific size, created parallel to the long axis of the femora. The outcomes of the in vivo study revealed that BPs promoted bone formation, which reversed the reduction in the DM group according to double fluorescence labeling, micro-CT, biomechanical and histomorphometric analyses (P<0.05). Furthermore, intergroup comparisons revealed significant correlation coefficients (P<0.05) between the micro-CT and biomechanical parameters. Therefore, local administration of BPs could stimulation bone remodeling and represent an effective treatment strategy for preventing decayed implant osseointegration under T2DM conditions.AJTR Copyright © 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31449894>Dietary Apigenin promotes lipid catabolism, thermogenesis, and browning in adipose tissues of HFD-Fed mice.</a></h1><p>Dietary Apigenin (AP), a natural flavonoid from plants, could alleviate high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity and its complication.

In five studies providing data on vitamin B12 concentrations for both groups, women with GDM had lower vitamin B12 levels when compared with non-GDM women. Women with vitamin B12 deficiency were at higher risk for developing GDM when compared with those who were vitamin B12 sufficient: OR 1.81 (95% CI, 1.25-2.63, I: 0%).

This study was designed to determine the relationships between bilirubin, body fat distribution, and adipose tissue inflammation in patients with type 2 DM and the effect of bilirubin in an obese animal model.Body fat distribution was measured using an abdominal dual bioelectrical impedance analyzer in patients with type 2 DM. We also measured glycemic control, lipid profile, serum bilirubin concentration and other clinical characteristics, and determined their relationships with body fat distribution. In the animal study, biliverdin (20 mg/kg daily) was orally administered to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese (DIO) mice for 2 weeks, after which intraperitoneal  tolerance testing was performed. Then, adipocyte area, adipocytokine expression, and macrophage polarization were evaluated in epididymal adipose tissues.In the clinical study, univariate analysis showed that a lower bilirubin concentration was significantly correlated with higher body mass index, waist circumference, triglyceride, uric , creatinine, visceral fat area and lower HDL-C. In multivariate analyses, bilirubin concentration significantly correlated with diastolic blood pressure, creatinine, and visceral fat area. However, there was no association between bilirubin concentration and subcutaneous fat area. In the animal study, DIO mice treated with biliverdin had smaller adipocytes than untreated DIO mice and biliverdin improved HFD-induced . Biliverdin treatment reversed the higher gene expression of Cd11c, encoding an M1 macrophage marker, and Tnfa, encoding the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α, in the adipose tissues of DIO mice.

Glucose and lipid metabolism are closely linked in white adipose tissue (WAT), yet the underlying mechanisms of the effect of iTFAs in WAT are poorly understood.Parameters of glucose homeostasis, lipid profiles and markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress of WAT were measured in rats maintained on a high-fat diet containing margarine (HFD-M) (n=10) compared to controls maintained on standard chow (n=10) over 16 weeks.Fat mass and body weight was significantly increased in rats maintained on the HFD-M compared to controls (<0.01). HFD-M rats had increased levels of  (INS), homeostasis model assessment of  and serum lipid profile was significantly altered. The expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and the phosphorylation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1-alpha and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were significantly increased in subcutaneous and retroperitoneal adipose depots of HFD-M-fed rats. In vitro, wider ER lumens were observed in 100μmol/L elaidic  (EA)-treated human mature adipocytes. We observed activation of ER stress markers, impaired INS receptor signaling and increased lipogenesis in adipocytes after EA exposure. These effects could be alleviated by inhibiting ER stress in adipocytes in vitro.Collectively these data suggest that ER stress may be involved in INS  and lipid metabolism disorders induced by high-fat diet containing iTFAs. These findings suggest that WAT could be regarded as a key target organ for inhibiting ER stress to reverse the impaired INS receptor signaling, alleviate lipid metabolism disorders, and provide a novel approach to prevent and treat INS  and dyslipidemia-related chronic diseases such as T2MD and CVDs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599919>A ketone monoester drink reduces the glycemic response to an oral glucose challenge in individuals with obesity: a randomized trial.</a></h1><p>Exogenous ketones make it possible to reach a state of ketosis that may improve metabolic control in humans.The main objective of this study was to determine whether the ingestion of a ketone monoester (KE) drink before a 2-h oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) would lower blood glucose concentrations. Secondary objectives were to determine the impact of KE on nonesterified fatty  (NEFA) concentration and glucoregulatory hormones.We conducted a randomized controlled crossover experiment in 15 individuals with obesity (mean ± SD age: 47 ± 10 y; BMI: 34 ± 5 kg/m2). After an overnight fast, participants consumed a KE drink [(R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate; 0.45 mL/kg body weight] or taste-matched control drink 30 min before completing a 75-g OGTT. Participants and study personnel performing laboratory analyses were blinded to each condition.The KE increased d-β-hydroxybutyrate to a maximum of ∼3.4 mM (P < 0.001) during the OGTT. Compared with the control drink, KE reduced glucose (-11%, P = 0.002), NEFA (-21%, P = 0.009), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (-31%, P = 0.001) areas under the curve (AUCs), whereas glucagon AUC increased (+11%, P = 0.030). No differences in triglyceride, C-peptide, and  AUCs were observed after the KE drink. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased and heart rate increased after the KE drink (both P < 0.01).A KE drink consumed before an OGTT lowered glucose and NEFA AUCs with no increase in circulating . Our results suggest that a single drink of KE may acutely improve metabolic control in individuals with obesity.

Despite significant disease burden and mortality associated with advanced disease, i.e., nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), there is currently no approved medication for NASH. Farnesoid X receptor agonists have been investigated as candidates for the treatment of NASH. Obeticholic , approved for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, has gained significant attention after showing promising results in patients with NASH and fibrosis. Three trials investigating the effect of obeticholic  in patients with NASH have been completed and the preliminary results of an ongoing one have also been made public. Generally, treatment with obeticholic  improved hepatic histology, including inflammation and fibrosis, the latter being the main histological predictor of advanced disease. Nonetheless, there were adverse effects, the most common being pruritus and unfavorable changes in the lipid profile. Pruritus led to discontinuation of treatment in some patients. Obeticholic , however, is not the only farnesoid X receptor agonist currently investigated for the treatment of NASH. Another farnesoid X receptor agonist, cilofexor, in combination with firsocostat, an acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor, improved hepatic steatosis, liver stiffness, liver function tests and serum fibrosis markers, without causing pruritus after 12 weeks of treatment. In conclusion, current evidence regarding the effect of farnesoid X receptor agonists on hepatic histology in patients with NASH is promising, but several safety issues need further evaluation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Machine learning applied to high-resolution metabolomics and clinical phenotype data offers a novel framework for developing a NAFLD screening panel in youth. Here, untargeted metabolomics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed on plasma samples from a combined cross-sectional sample of children and adolescents ages 2-25 years old with NAFLD (n = 222) and without NAFLD (n = 337), confirmed by liver biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging. Anthropometrics, blood lipids, liver enzymes, and glucose and  metabolism were also assessed. A machine learning approach was applied to the metabolomics and clinical phenotype data sets, which were split into training and test sets, and included dimension reduction, feature selection, and classification model development. The selected metabolite features were the amino  serine, leucine/isoleucine, and tryptophan; three putatively annotated compounds (dihydrothymine and two phospholipids); and two unknowns. The selected clinical phenotype variables were waist circumference, whole-body  sensitivity index (WBISI) based on the oral glucose tolerance test, and blood triglycerides. The highest performing classification model was random forest, which had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94, sensitivity of 73%, and specificity of 97% for detecting NAFLD cases. A second classification model was developed using the homeostasis model assessment of  substituted for the WBISI. Similarly, the highest performing classification model was random forest, which had an AUROC of 0.92, sensitivity of 73%, and specificity of 94%.  The identified screening panel consisting of both metabolomics and clinical features has promising potential for screening for NAFLD in youth. Further development of this panel and independent validation testing in other cohorts are warranted.© 2019 The Authors.

To address these questions, plasma metabolite patterns were determined every 5 min during exercise (30 min, ~45% of V̇O, ~63 W) and recovery in overnight-fasted sedentary, obese,  resistant women under controlled conditions of diet and physical activity. We hypothesized that improved fitness and  sensitivity following a ~14 wk training and weight loss intervention would lead to fixed workload plasma metabolomics signatures reflective of metabolic health and muscle metabolism. Pattern analysis over the first 15 min of exercise-regardless of pre- vs. post-intervention status-highlighted anticipated increases in fatty  tissue uptake and oxidation (e.g., reduced long-chain fatty ), diminution of non-oxidative fates of glucose (e.g., lowered sorbitol-pathway metabolites and glycerol-3-galactoside [possible glycerolipid synthesis metabolite]), and enhanced tissue amino  use (e.g., drops in amino ; modest increase in urea). A novel observation was that exercise significantly increased several xenometabolites ("non-self" molecules, from microbes or foods), including benzoic /salicylic /salicylaldehyde, hexadecanol/octadecanol/dodecanol, and chlorogenic . In addition, many non-annotated metabolites changed with exercise. Although exercise itself strongly impacted the global metabolome, there were surprisingly few intervention-associated differences despite marked improvements in  sensitivity, fitness, and adiposity. These results, and previously-reported plasma acylcarnitine profiles, support the principle that most metabolic changes during sub-maximal aerobic exercise are closely tethered to absolute ATP turnover rate (workload), regardless of fitness or metabolic health status.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31452923>Linoleic  in diets of mice increases total endocannabinoid levels in bowel and liver: modification by dietary glucose.</a></h1><p>Linoleic  (LA) is an essential fatty  involved in the biosynthesis of arachidonic  and prostaglandins. LA is known to induce obesity and . In this study, two concentrations of LA with or without added glucose (G) were fed to mice to investigate their effects on endocannabinoid (EC) biology.Four groups of C57BL/6 mice were provided with diets containing 1% or 8% LA with or without added G (LAG) for 8 weeks. Body weights, food intake, circulating glucose and  levels were measured throughout the study. Following euthanasia, plasma, bowel and hepatic ECs, monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty  amide hydroxylase protein levels (enzymes responsible for EC degradation) and transcriptional activity of PPARα in liver were quantified. Liver was probed for evidence of  receptor activity perturbation.Increasing dietary LA from 1% to 8% significantly increased circulating, small bowel and hepatic ECs. 1%LAG fed mice had lowest feed efficiency, and only liver levels of both ECs were reduced by addition of G. Addition of G to 1% LA diets resulted in elevated monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty  amide hydroxylase protein levels ( < 0.001 and  < 0.001, respectively) in liver due to increased transcriptional activity of PPARα ( < 0.05). The reduced EC levels with addition of G also correlated with a measure of enhanced  action.In conclusion, body weight of mice is influenced by the source of calorie intake. Furthermore, tissue EC/g are dependent on tissue-specific synthesis and degradation that are modulated by dietary LA and G which also influence food efficiency, and down-stream  signalling pathways. The findings could potentially be useful information for weight management efforts in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613643>Influence of Obesity, Weight Loss, and Free Fatty  on Skeletal Muscle Clock Gene Expression.</a></h1><p>The molecular circadian clock plays a role in metabolic homeostasis.

Skeletal muscle clock gene expression was affected by obesity and weight loss.  mRNA (P=0.05) was increased and  mRNA (P<0.05) was decreased in obese versus normal weight women and restored to control levels after RYGB-induced weight loss. , ,  and  mRNA (P<0.05) was decreased in obese men as compared to normal weight men. Expression of all other clock genes was unaltered by obesity or weight loss in both cohorts. We correlated clock gene expression with clinical characteristics of the participants.

Circadian time-course studies revealed that core clock genes oscillate over time (P<0.05), with , , , ,  and  expression profiles altered by palmitate treatment. In conclusion, skeletal muscle clock gene expression and function is altered by obesity, coincident with changes in plasma lipid levels. Palmitate exposure disrupts clock gene expression in myotubes, indicating dyslipidemia directly alters the circadian program. Strategies to reduce lipid overload and prevent elevations in NEFA and cholesterol levels may sustain circadian clock signals in skeletal muscle.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646708>: Relationship between indices during late gestation in dairy cows and effects on newborn metabolism.</a></h1><p>To investigate the relationship between  indices ["Revised quantitative  sensitivity check index" (RQUICKI; RQ), "Revised quantitative  sensitivity check index - β-hydroxybutyrate" (RQUICKI ; RQ ), and "Homeostasis model assessment-" (HOMA-IR; HR)], and metabolic parameters in dams during late gestation, and their newborn calves.

Associated with the metabolic syndrome, NAFLD is mostly driven by -resistant white adipose tissue lipolysis that results in an increased hepatic fatty  influx and the ectopic accumulation of fat in the liver. Upregulation of beta-oxidation as one compensatory mechanism leads to an increase in mitochondrial tricarboxylic  cycle flux and ATP generation. The progression of NAFLD is associated with alterations in the mitochondrial molecular composition and respiratory capacity, which increases their vulnerability to different stressors, including calcium and pro-inflammatory molecules, which result in an increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that, altogether, may ultimately lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. This may activate further pro-inflammatory pathways involved in the progression from steatosis to steatohepatitis (NASH). Mushroom-enriched diets, or the administration of their isolated bioactive compounds, have been shown to display beneficial effects on , hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation by regulating nutrient uptake and lipid metabolism as well as modulating the antioxidant activity of the cell. In addition, the gut microbiota has also been described to be modulated by mushroom bioactive molecules, with implications in reducing liver inflammation during NAFLD progression. Dietary mushroom extracts have been reported to have anti-tumorigenic properties and to induce cell-death via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. This calls for particular attention to the potential therapeutic properties of these natural compounds which may push the development of novel pharmacological options to treat NASH and HCC. We here review the diverse effects of mushroom-enriched diets in liver disease, emphasizing those effects that are dependent on mitochondria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552262>The Role of the IGF-1 Signaling Cascade in Muscle Protein Synthesis and Anabolic  in Aging Skeletal Muscle.</a></h1><p>Sarcopenia is defined as the combined loss of skeletal muscle strength, function, and/or mass with aging. This degenerative loss of muscle mass is associated with poor quality of life and early mortality humans. The loss of muscle mass occurs due to acute changes in daily muscle net protein balance (NPB). It is generally believed a poor NPB occurs due to reduced muscle protein synthetic responses to exercise, dietary amino  availability, or an insensitivity of  to suppress breakdown. Hence, aging muscles appear to be resistant to the anabolic action of exercise and protein (amino  or hormonal) when compared to their younger counterparts. The mechanisms that underpin anabolic  to anabolic stimuli (protein and  exercise) are multifactorial and may be partly driven by poor lifestyle choices (increased sedentary time and reduced dietary protein intake) as well as an inherent dysregulated mechanism in old muscles irrespective of the environmental stimuli. The  like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), Akt /Protein Kinase B and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is the primary driver between mechanical contraction and protein synthesis and may be a site of dysregulation between old and younger people. Therefore, our review aims to describe and summarize the differences seen in older muscle in this pathway in response to  exercise (RE) and describe approaches that researchers have sought out to maximize the response in muscle. Furthermore, this review will present the hypothesis that inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1) may be implicated in IGF-1 signaling and thus sarcopenia, based on recent evidence that IGF-1 and  share some intracellular bound signaling events and that IP6K1 has been implicated in skeletal muscle .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505460>GLUCOCORTICOID REGULATION OF AMINO  TRANSPORT IN PRIMARY HUMAN TROPHOBLAST CELLS.</a></h1><p>Excess maternal glucocorticoids reduce placental amino  transport and fetal growth, but whether these effects are mediated directly on the syncytiotrophoblast remains unknown. We hypothesised that glucocorticoids inhibit mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and -stimulated System A amino  transport activity in primary human trophoblast (PHT) cells. Syncytialised PHTs, isolated from term placentas (n=15), were treated with either cortisol (1μM) or dexamethasone (1μM), ±  (1nM) for 24 hours. Compared to vehicle, dexamethasone increased mRNA expression, but not protein abundance of the mTOR suppressor, regulated in development and DNA damage response 1 (REDD1). Dexamethasone enhanced  receptor abundance, activated mTOR complex 1 and 2 signaling and stimulated System A activity, measured by Na+-dependent 14C-methylaminoisobutyric  uptake. Cortisol also activated mTORC1 without significantly altering  receptor or mTORC2 read-outs, or System A activity. Both glucocorticoids downregulated expression of the glucocorticoid receptor and the System A transporter genes SLC38A1, SLC38A2 and SLC38A4, without altering SNAT1 or SNAT4 protein abundance. Neither cortisol nor dexamethasone affected System L amino  transport.  further enhanced mTOR and System A activity, irrespective of glucocorticoid treatment and despite downregulating its own receptor. Contrary to our hypothesis, glucocorticoids do not inhibit mTOR signaling or cause  in cultured PHT cells. We speculate that glucocorticoids stimulate System A activity in PHT cells by activating mTOR signaling, which regulates amino  transporters post-translationally. We conclude that down-regulation of placental nutrient transport in vivo following excess maternal glucocorticoids is not mediated by a direct effect on the placenta.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613536>Fibrate Medications.</a></h1><p>The fibrates are a type of amphipathic carboxylic , belonging to the class of drugs used to lower serum cholesterol levels. They are currently the most important class of drugs combating the worldwide epidemic of atherogenic dyslipidemia.

The amyloid cascade hypothesis based on the fundamental role of amyloid has been the central hypothesis in the last 30 years. However, since amyloid-directed treatments have shown no relevant beneficial results other theories have been postulated to explain the origin of the pathology. The brain is a highly metabolically active energy-consuming tissue in the human body. It has an almost complete dependence on the metabolism of glucose and uses most of its energy for synaptic transmission. Thus, alterations on the utilization or availability of glucose may be cause for the appearance of neurodegenerative pathologies like AD. In this review article, the hypothesis known as Type 3 Diabetes (T3D) will be evaluated by summarizing some of the data that has been reported in recent years. According to published research, the adherence over time to low saturated fatty  diets in the context of the Mediterranean diet would reduce the inflammatory levels in brain, with a decrease in the pro-inflammatory glial activation and mitochondrial oxidative stress. In this situation, the  receptor pathway would be able to fine tune the mitochondrial biogenesis in neuronal cells, regulation the adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate intracellular balance, and becoming a key factor involved in the preservation of the synaptic connexions and neuronal plasticity. In addition, new targets and strategies for the treatment of AD will be considered in this review for their potential as new pharmacological or non-pharmacological approaches.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500257>Late-Evening Snack with Branched-Chain Amino -Enriched Nutrients Does Not Always Inhibit Overt Diabetes in Patients with Cirrhosis: A Pilot Study.</a></h1><p>Cirrhosis patients often have abnormal glucose metabolism. We investigated the effects of a late-evening snack (LES) with branched-chain amino -enriched nutrients (BCAA-EN) on glucose metabolism in cirrhosis patients. LES with BCAA-EN was administered for 1 week in 13 patients with cirrhosis and hypoalbuminemia. Blood glucose (BG) levels were measured every 15 min. The patients were divided into two groups based on BG levels: group 1 (G1,  = 11): nocturnal BG levels <200 mg/dL and group 2 (G2,  = 2): nocturnal BG levels ≥200 mg/dL. G1 had nocturnal BG levels <200 mg/dL, whereas G2 had nocturnal BG levels ≥200 mg/dL. The average BG levels did not significantly change after BCAA-EN administration in G1 (before 91.9 ± 29.0 mg/dL; after 89.0 ± 24.3 mg/dl). However, the average BG levels significantly increased after BCAA-EN administration in G2 (before 153.6 ± 43.3 mg/dL; after 200.9 ± 59.7 mg/dL) ( < 0.01). The glycated albumin level (16.6 ± 0.9% vs. 16.2 ± 2.1%), fasting immunoreactive  (F-IRI) level (53.9 ± 34.0 μU/mL vs. 16.5 ± 11.0 μU/mL), and homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) score (17.85 ± 10.58 vs. 4.02 ± 2.59) were significantly higher in G2 than in G1 ( < 0.05,  < 0.05, and  < 0.01, respectively). The quantitative  sensitivity check indices (0.32 ± 0.03 vs. 0.27 ± 0.02) were significantly higher in G1 than in G2 ( < 0.01). One patient in G2 was obese and had type 2 diabetes. The other patient was obese and had a high HOMA-IR score and F-IRI level. A LES with BCAA-EN does not inhibit overt diabetes in most cirrhosis patients. However, close attention should be paid to fluctuations in BG levels in cirrhosis patients who present with obesity and severe .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425955>Assessment of PON1 activity and circulating TF levels in relation to BMI, testosterone, HOMA-IR, HDL-C, LDL-C, CHO, SOD activity and TAC in women with PCOS: An observational study.</a></h1><p>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common female endocrinopathy among premenopausal women associated with hyperandrogenism, obesity, dyslipidemia,  and inflammation. Oxidative stress is an important component of cardio-metabolic risk seen in PCOS.A total of 95 women with PCOS and 95 healthy controls were included in this observational study. Serum PON1 activity and stress markers were measured by spectrophotometric methods. Circulating TF level was measured by ELISA.We found decreased PON1 activity and increased TF levels in women with PCOS compared to healthy controls. Fasting , HOMA-IR, testosterone, LDL-C, MDA, PC and SOD activity were significantly increased whereas FGIR, QUICKI, HDLC, CAT and TAC were significantly decreased in PCOS women than controls. We observed a positive association of PON1 activity with FGIR, QUICKI, HDL-C and TAC, and its negative association was observed with LH, testosterone, fasting  and HOMA-IR in PCOS women. We further observed a positive association of TF with waist, waist to hip ratio, BMI, glucose 1hr, cholesterol, LDL-C, SGPT, uric  and SOD activity in PCOS women.Decreased PON1 activity and raised circulating TF levels are respective indicators of pro-inflammatory and procoagulant status in PCOS women. The imbalanced oxidant/antioxidant status further supports the evidences that PCOS is an oxidant state. Further, the association of PON1 activity and TF levels with the clinical, laboratory findings and stress marker levels suggest that these factors taken together are involved in aggravating the pro-inflammatory status in PCOS women.Copyright © 2019 Diabetes India.

Ginsenoside Rg1 (GRg1), the major active ginsenoside enriched in tonic food ginseng, was reported to help alleviate liver diseases. In the present study, GRg1 was evaluated for its impact on palmitic  (PA)-induced hepatic  model in vitro. in HepG2 cells was induced by 0.5 mM PA exposure for 24 h and then the effect of GRg1 on cellular glucose consumption was measured. Expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphate (G6Pase) were analyzed by Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Activation of protein kinases and transcript factor was analyzed by measuring protein phosphorylation. The influence of GRg1 on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HepG2 was also examined.GRg1 reversed PA-induced decrease in glucose consumption of HepG2 cells by downregulating gluconeogenesis genes G6pase and PEPCK. GRg1 increased Akt activation but inhibited JNK activation in PA-challenged HepG2 cells. Cellular ROS level was elevated in -resistant HepG2 cells but was reduced by GRg1.Together these findings indicate that GRg1 protects against hepatic  via preserving  signaling sensitivity and is a promising alternative medicine.Copyright © 2019.

Obesity and overweight are closely related to metabolic diseases and diabetes. However, the role of adipose tissue in the pathogenesis of GDM remains to be studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of vitamin D (VD) levels, VD receptor (VDR), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) expression with GDM in overweight or obese women.One hundred and forty pregnant women with full-term single-birth cesarean-section were selected as the study subjects and grouped (70 GDM women, including 35 non-overweight/non-obese women [group G1] and 35 women with overweight or obesity [group G2]; 70 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance, including 35 non-overweight/non-obese women [group N1] and 35 overweight/obese women [group N2]). The levels of serum VD, blood biochemistry, and adiponectin were compared in these women. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was isolated from the abdominal wall incision. VDR and PPARγ messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript levels in these adipose tissues were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The differences between the levels of PPARγ protein and phosphorylated PPARγ Ser273 were detected by Western blotting.The serum VD level of GDM women was lower in comparison to that of women with normal glucose tolerance (G1 vs. N1: 20.62 ± 7.87 ng/mL vs. 25.85 ± 7.29 ng/mL, G2 vs. N2: 17.06 ± 6.74 ng/mL vs. 21.62 ± 7.18 ng/mL, P < 0.05), and the lowest in overweight/obese GDM women. VDR and PPARγ mRNA expression was higher in the adipose tissues of GDM women in comparison to that of women with normal glucose tolerance (VDR mRNA: G1 vs. N1: 210.00 [90.58-311.46] vs. 89.34 [63.74-159.92], G2 vs. N2: 298.67 [170.84-451.25] vs. 198.28 [119.46-261.23], PPARγ mRNA: G1 vs. N1: 100.72 [88.61-123.87] vs. 87.52 [66.37-100.04], G2 vs. N2: 117.33 [100.08-149.00] vs. 89.90 [76.95-109.09], P < 0.05), and their expression was the highest in GDM + overweight/obese women. VDR mRNA levels positively correlated with the pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), pre-delivery BMI, fasting blood glucose (FBG), homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR), and PPARγ mRNA while it negatively correlated with the VD and the adiponectin levels (r = 0.395, 0.336, 0.240, 0.190, 0.235, -0.350, -0.294, respectively, P < 0.05). The degree of PPARγ Ser273 phosphorylation increased in obese and GDM pregnant women. PPARγ mRNA levels positively correlated with pre-pregnancy BMI, pre-delivery BMI, FBG, HOMA-IR, serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, free fatty , and VDR mRNA, while it negatively correlated with the VD and adiponectin levels (r = 0.276, 0.199, 0.210, 0.230, 0.182, 0.214, 0.270, 0.235, -0.232, -0.199, respectively, P < 0.05).Both GDM and overweight/obese women had decreased serum VD levels and up-regulated VDR and PPARγ mRNA expression in adipose tissue, which was further higher in the overweight or obese women with GDM.

However, efficacious pharmacological treatment for NASH is lacking. A major issue for preclinical evaluation of potential therapeutics for NASH is the limited number of appropriate animal models, i.e., models that do not require long-term dietary intervention and adequately mimic disease progression in humans. The present study aimed to evaluate a 3-wk dietary mouse model of NASH and validate it by studying the effects of liraglutide, a compound in advanced clinical development for NASH. C57BL6/J mice were fed a diet high in fat (60%), cholesterol (1.25%), and cholic  (0.5%), along with 2% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin in drinking water (HFCC-CDX diet). Histological and biological parameters were measured at 1 and 3 wk. After 1-wk diet induction, liraglutide was administrated daily for 2 wk and then NASH-associated phenotypic aspects were evaluated in comparison with control mice. Prior to treatment with liraglutide, mice fed the HFCC-CDX diet for 1 wk developed liver steatosis and had increased levels of oxidative-stress markers and hepatic and systemic inflammation. For mice not treated with liraglutide, these aspects were even more pronounced after 3 wk of the dietary period, with additional liver  and fibrosis. Liraglutide treatment corrected the diet-induced alterations in glucose metabolism and significantly reduced hepatic steatosis and inflammation. This study provides a novel 3-wk dietary model of mice that rapidly develop NASH features, and this model will be suitable for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of compounds in preclinical drug development for NASH. We propose a diet high in fat (60%), cholesterol (1.25%), and cholic  (0.5%) along with 2% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin in drinking water (HFCC-CDX diet) as a new dietary model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. We used the HFCC-CDX model to reproduce the main features of disease development in humans for the purpose of facilitating the rapid screening of drug candidates and prioritizing the more promising candidates for advanced preclinical assessment and subsequent clinical trials.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31539818>Parenteral amino  supplementation with high-dose  prevents hypoaminoacidemia during cardiac surgery.</a></h1><p>Surgery triggers a stress response that produces  and hyperglycemia. During cardiac surgery, the administration of high-dose  along with dextrose titration maintains normoglycemia, but dramatically decreases plasma amino  (AAs) compared with preoperative fasting levels. Hypoaminoacidemia limits protein synthesis and prevents anabolic responses after surgery. We investigated whether parenteral infusion of AAs during and immediately after cardiac surgery would prevent hypoaminoacidemia in patients who receive high-dose  therapy.Sixteen patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery were randomly allocated to receive AAs with % kcal equivalent to either 20% (n = 8) or 35% (n = 8) of their measured resting energy expenditure (REE).  was infused at a constant rate of 5 mU/(kg × min), whereas dextrose was titrated to maintain normoglycemia during and until 5 h after surgery. Plasma AA concentrations were measured at baseline before and after surgery.Compared with the 20% AA group after surgery, AA concentrations were significantly higher in the 35% AA group for 12 of 20 AAs (P < 0.032), including all branched-chain AAs. In the 20% AA group, total essential AAs decreased by 21% and nonessential AAs decreased by 14% after surgery compared with preoperative fasting levels. In contrast, giving 35% AAs prevented this unfavorable decrease in AAs, and in fact allowed for a 23% and 12% increase in essential and nonessential AAs, respectively.AA supplementation at 35% REE, but not 20% REE, can effectively prevent hypoaminoacidemia caused by high-dose  therapy during cardiac surgery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The present study investigated the potential role of isoimperatorin on 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. mRNA and protein levels of differentiation- and lipid accumulation-associated genes, as well as the adipogenesis-related signaling pathway were analyzed in control and isoimperatorin-treated differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. Results determined that isoimperatorin promoted 3T3-L1 fibroblast adipogenesis in a dose-dependent manner compared with standard differentiation inducers. Isoimperatorin significantly increased mRNA and protein expression of the crucial adipogenic transcription factors peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα). mRNA expression of the downstream adipogenesis-related genes sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1c, adipocyte protein 2, fatty  synthase, adiponectin and diacylglycerol -acyltransferase 2 were also significantly increased following isoimperatorin treatment. The underlying mechanism likely involved activation of the Akt signaling pathway. Taken together, the present findings indicated that isoimperatorin may alter PPARγ and C/EBPα expression via the Akt signaling pathway, resulting in promotion of adipogenesis.

Methyl ferulic  (MFA) is a biologically active monomer isolated from the root of  Hasskarl. It has been reported that MFA has a hepatoprotective effect against alcohol-induced liver injury  and . However, the effect of MFA on ethanol-induced  in ALD remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether MFA could exert protective effects against hepatic  in ethanol-induced L-02 cells and ALD rats. ALD was induced in vivo by feeding Lieber-DeCarli diet containing 5% (w/v) alcohol for 16 weeks to Sprague-Dawley rats.  was induced  in human hepatocyte L-02 cells with 200 mM ethanol for 24 h followed by 10-7 nM  for 30 min. MFA exhibited the effects of inhibited , reduced enzymatic capacity for hepatic gluconeogenesis, and increased hepatic glycogen synthesis both  and . In addition, the results of transcriptome sequencing of liver tissues in the ethanol- and MFA-treated groups indicated that "pyruvate metabolism," "glycolysis/gluconeogenesis," and "fatty  metabolism" were significantly different between ethanol- and MFA-treated groups. Further studies suggested that MFA activated the hepatic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway  and .

Once activated, it promotes glucose-stimulated  secretion (GSIS). However, increased levels of FFAs lead to lipotoxicity, inducing loss of β-cell function. FFAR1 plays a key role in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and previous studies have indicated the importance of developing anti-diabetic therapies against FFAR1, although its role in the regulation of β-cell function remains unclear. The present study investigated the role of FFAR1 under lipotoxic conditions using palmitic  (PA). The rat insulinoma 1 clone 832/13 (INS-1 832/13) cell line was used as a model as it physiologically resembles native pancreatic β-cells. Key players of the  signaling pathway, such as mTOR, Akt, IRS-1, and the  receptor (INSR1β), were selected as candidates to be analyzed under lipotoxic conditions.We revealed that PA-induced lipotoxicity affected GSIS in INS-1 cells and negatively modulated the activity of both IRS-1 and Akt. Reduced phosphorylation of both IRS-1 S636/639 and Akt S473 was observed, in addition to decreased expression of both INSR1β and FFAR1. Moreover, transient knockdown of FFAR1 led to a reduction in IRS-1 mRNA expression and an increase in INSR1β mRNA. Finally, PA affected localization of FFAR1 from the cytoplasm to the perinucleus.In conclusion, our study suggests a novel regulatory involvement of FFAR1 in crosstalk with mTOR-Akt and IRS-1 signaling in β-cells under lipotoxic conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659239>Uncarboxylated osteocalcin ameliorates hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice via activating  signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>Osteocalcin, expressed in osteoblasts of the bone marrow, undergoes post-translational carboxylation and deposits in mineralized bone matrix. A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate  secretion and  sensitivity. As  is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, , and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body  sensitivity, glucose metabolism, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced  sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body  sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting fatty- β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic  sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31472955>Vitexin alleviates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by activating AMPK in high fat diet fed mice.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a most common liver disorder characterized by accumulation of fat in the liver and currently there is no approved treatment for it. Obesity and diabetes being leading cause of NAFLD, compounds having anti-obesity activity and potential to reduce  are considered suitable candidate for NAFLD treatment. In this study, we checked effect of vitexin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, on high fat diet (HFD) induced NAFLD in C57BL/6J mice. In presence of vitexin, significant reduction in body and liver weight, triglyceride and cholesterol content in serum and liver was observed. Serum Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were reduced significantly by vitexin which were elevated in HFD group whereas serum lipase activity remained unchanged. Vitexin suppressed de novo lipogenesis by downregulating expression of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBP-α), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), Fatty  synthase (FAS) and Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC). Additionally, it also enhanced fatty  oxidation and lipolysis by upregulating Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α), carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1a (CPT-1a) and Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). Inhibition of lipogenesis and activation of lipolysis and fatty  oxidation by vitexin was found to be mediated by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Vitexin also improved  signalling by activating  receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and its downstream target AKT. AMPK activation of vitexin was possibly through binding of vitexin to leptin receptor (LepR) which was confirmed by molecular docking studies and by observed enhanced expression of LepR. Thus, we propose that vitexin alleviates NAFLD by activating AMPK possibly by binding to LepR.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Two and seven days of forearm immobilization led to a 40±7% and 52±7% decrease in FGU, respectively (P<0.001), with no difference between day 2 and 7 and no effect of HFD. Forearm NEFA balance tended to increase following two and seven days of immobilization (P=0.095).forearm immobilization leads to a rapid and substantial decrease in FGU, which is accompanied by an increase in forearm NEFA balance but is not exacerbated by excess dietary fat intake.

Here, we showed that treatment of diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice with 2-AAA, significantly reduced body weight, decreased fat accumulation and lowered fasting glucose. Furthermore, Dhtkd1-/- mice, in which the substrate of DHTKD1 2-AAA increased to a significant high level, were resistant to DIO and obesity-related . Further study showed that 2-AAA induced higher energy expenditure due to increased adipocyte thermogenesis via up-regulating PGC1α and UCP1 mediated by β3AR activation, and stimulated lipolysis depending on enhanced expression of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) through activating β3AR signaling. Moreover, 2-AAA could alleviate the diabetic symptoms of db/db mice.

In this study, we aimed to unravel the role of both intestinal barrier integrity and microbiota in NAFLD/NASH development.C57BL/6J mice were fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or methionine-choline-deficient diet for 1 week or longer to recapitulate aspects of NASH (steatosis, inflammation, ). Genetic and pharmacological strategies were then used to modulate intestinal barrier integrity.We show that disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier and gut vascular barrier (GVB) are early events in NASH pathogenesis. Mice fed HFD for only 1 week undergo a diet-induced dysbiosis that drives GVB damage and bacterial translocation into the liver. Fecal microbiota transplantation from HFD-fed mice into specific pathogen-free recipients induces GVB damage and epididymal adipose tissue enlargement. GVB disruption depends on interference with the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, as shown by genetic intervention driving β-catenin activation only in endothelial cells, preventing GVB disruption and NASH development. The bile  analogue and farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic  (OCA) drives β-catenin activation in endothelial cells. Accordingly, pharmacologic intervention with OCA protects against GVB disruption, both as a preventive and therapeutic agent. Importantly, we found upregulation of the GVB leakage marker in the colon of patients with NASH.We have identified a new player in NASH development, the GVB, whose damage leads to bacteria or bacterial product translocation into the blood circulation. Treatment aimed at restoring β-catenin activation in endothelial cells, such as administration of OCA, protects against GVB damage and NASH development.The incidence of fatty liver disease is reaching epidemic levels in the USA, with more than 30% of adults having NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), which can progress to more severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Herein, we show that disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier and gut vascular barrier are early events in the development of NASH. We show that the drug obeticholic  protects against barrier disruption and thereby prevents the development of NASH, providing further evidence for its use in the prevention or treatment of NASH.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

The objective of this study was to assess the effects of low (≤0.75) . high (>0.75) drops in body condition score (BCS) until day 60 post-partum on energy metabolism indices during mid-lactation in Holstein cows.Twenty-eight Holstein cows were included in the study from the day of calving to day 120 of lactation. Whole blood samples were taken on 60, 90, and 120 days in milk (DIM). Serum was analyzed for , glucose, non-esterified fatty  (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels.In cows with low BCS drop (LoD group),  did not change significantly through days 60 to 120 of lactation, but increased in high drop cows (HiD group) (P<0.001). Glucose concentrations decreased linearly in the LoD cows (P=0.039) and showed a quadratic increase in the HiD group on day 90 (P=0.028). Concentrations of non-esterified fatty  showed both linear (P=0.04) and quadratic (P=0.002) changes in the HiD group. The HiD cows had significantly higher concentrations of  on day 120 (P=0.017) compared to the LoD group. Glucose concentration was lower (P<0.01) in HiD cows on 60 DIM. The concentration of non-esterified fatty  was higher in HiD cows on day 90 (P<0.01). Surrogate indices of  (calculated based on the concentrations of the measured metabolites) were different between the groups on day 90, indicating decreased  sensitivity in the HiD cows.Greater depletion of body reserves during early lactation may result in some inconsistencies in energy metabolism during mid-lactation periods. Controlling BCS loss during early lactation may help alleviate such alterations possibly through modifying  sensitivity of the tissues.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451009>Improvement of Lipoprotein Profile and Metabolic Endotoxemia by a Lifestyle Intervention That Modifies the Gut Microbiota in Subjects With Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h1><p>Background Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a serious health problem over the world; thus, the aim of the present work was to develop a lifestyle intervention to decrease the dysbiosis of gut microbiota and reduce the biochemical abnormalities of MetS. Methods and Results The prevalence of MetS was evaluated in 1065 subjects of Mexico City, Mexico, and the gut microbiota in a subsample. Subjects with MetS were selected for a pragmatic study based on a lifestyle intervention with a low-saturated-fat diet, reduced-energy intake, with functional foods and physical activity, and a second group was selected for a randomized control-placebo study to assess the gut microbiota after the dietary intervention. Prevalence of MetS was 53%, and the higher the body mass index, the higher the gut microbiota dysbiosis. The higher the Homeostatic Model Assessment for , the lower the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. The pragmatic study revealed that after 15 days on a low-saturated-fat diet, there was a 24% reduction in serum triglycerides; and after a 75-day lifestyle intervention, MetS was reduced by 44.8%, with a reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, small low-density lipoprotein particles, glucose intolerance, lipopolysaccharide, and branched-chain amino . The randomized control-placebo study showed that after the lifestyle intervention, there was a decrease in the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota associated with a reduction in the Prevotella/ Bacteroides ratio and an increase in the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Conclusions A lifestyle intervention significantly decreased MetS components, small low-density lipoprotein particle concentration, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and metabolic endotoxemia, reducing the risk of atherosclerosis.

However, for hypermetabolic conditions stemming from burn trauma or cancer cachexia, browning is thought to contribute to energy wasting and supraphysiological nutritional requirements. Metformin's impact on this phenomenon and underlying mechanisms have not been explored.We used both a murine burn model and human ex vivo adipose explants to assess metformin and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)'s effects on the development of subcutaneous beige adipose. Enzymes involved in fat homeostasis and browning, as well as mitochondrial dynamics, were assessed to determine metformin's effects.Treatment with the biguanide metformin lowers lipolysis in beige fat by inducing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) independently of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation. Increased PP2A activity catalyzes the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser 79) and hormone sensitive lipase (Ser 660), thus promoting fat storage and the "whitening" of otherwise lipolytic beige adipocytes. Moreover, co-incubation of metformin with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic  countered the anti-lipolytic effects of this biguanide in human adipose. Additionally, we show that metformin does not activate this pathway in the WAT of control mice and that AICAR sustains the browning of white adipose, offering further evidence that metformin acts independently of this cellular energy sensor.This work provides novel insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of metformin's therapeutic benefits and potential as an agent to reduce the lipotoxicity associated with hypermetabolism and adipose browning.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We thus generated fatty -binding protein 4 (Fabp4)-GDF5 transgenic (TG) mice and showed that GDF5 TG mice developed a relative lean phenotype on a high-fat diet (HFD) and showed increased  sensitivity. Over expression of GDF5 in adipose tissues greatly promoted the thermogenic process in sWAT after cold or β3-agonist treatment. In TG mice, sWAT showed an important thermogenic effect as the thermogenic gene expression was markedly increased, which was consistent with the typical features of beige adipocytes. Moreover, knockdown of the protein GDF5 impaired browning program in sWAT after thermogenic stimuli. Enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) signaling was also identified in sWAT of HFD-fed GDF5 mice, and thermogenesis in mature adipocytes induced by GDF5 protein could be partly blocked by a p38 MAPK inhibitor. Taken together, our data suggest that GDF5 could improve  sensitivity and prevent metabolic syndrome, the adaptive thermogenesis in sWAT could mediate the obesity  effects of GDF5 in mice and partially resulted in the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551816>BCAA Catabolic Defect Alters Glucose Metabolism in Lean Mice.</a></h1><p>Recent studies show branched-chain amino  (BCAA) catabolic pathway is defective in obese animals and humans, contributing to the pathogenesis of  and diabetes. However, in the context of obesity, various processes including the dysfunctional lipid metabolism can affect  sensitivity and glycemic regulation. It remains unclear how BCAA catabolic defect may exert direct impacts on glucose metabolism without the disturbance of obesity. The current study characterized the glucose metabolism in lean mice in which the genetic deletion of PP2Cm leads to moderate BCAA catabolic defect. Interestingly, compared to the wildtype control, lean PP2Cm deficient mice showed enhanced  sensitivity and glucose tolerance, lower body weight, and the preference for carbohydrate over lipids utilization. Metabolomics profiling of plasma and tissues revealed significantly different metabolic patterns in the PP2Cm deficient mice, featured by the marked alterations in glucose metabolic processes, including gluconeogenesis/glycolysis, glycogen metabolism, and tricarboxylic  cycle. The metabolic changes of glucose were predominantly observed in liver but not skeletal muscle or white adipose tissue. The elevated branched-chain keto  (BCKAs) resulted from the BCAA catabolic defect may play a critical role in regulating the expression of key regulators of glucose metabolic processes and the activity of respiratory Complex II/succinate dehydrogenase in TCA cycle. Together, these results show BCAA catabolic defect significantly alters glucose metabolism in lean mice with some impacts different or even opposite from those in obese mice, highlighting the critical role of BCAA catabolism in glycemic regulation and the complex interplay between macronutrients in lean and obese animals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31506152>[Correlation between serum microRNA-122 and  in obese children].</a></h1><p>To study the relationship between serum microRNA-122 (miR-122) and  in obese children.Forty-seven children with severely obesity aged 7-14 years and 45 age- and gender matched healthy children with normal weight (control group) were enrolled.

We investigated 11 lactating cows presumed to have SARA based on duration of ruminal pH <5.6 and reticulum pH <6.3 in 2015-2016. Kraft pulp (KP) was used to supplement feed of 7 of the cows studied in an effort to reduce SARA. We continuously monitored ruminal pH and measured blood concentrations of hormones and metabolites related to energy metabolism. Blood measurements included glucose (GLU), total cholesterol (TC), free fatty  (FFA), , adiponectin (ADN), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Additionally, we analyzed milk data (milk yield, milk fat percentage, milk protein percentage, milk urea nitrogen, and protein fat ratio) and reproduction data. The results demonstrated that ADN levels at 4 weeks post-parturition correlated with the total amount of time that the ruminal or reticulum fluid pH was under the threshold during 1 week post-parturition, as well as the numbers of days the cows were diagnosed with SARA (SARA-positive days) up to 30 days post-parturition. SARA-positive days in 2016 were higher than those in 2015. In both years, numbers of SARA-positive days for cows supplemented with KP were lower than those for cows without KP. Increased ADN levels may be a compensatory reaction to frequent SARA which modulates the inflammatory response against high LPS levels and improves  caused by LPS.

However, development of uncoupler-based therapy remains challenging due to its potentially lethal side effects. Here we identify pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) as a key modifier of the toxicity profile of dinitrophenol (DNP), a prototypical mitochondrial uncoupler. PDH activation by dichloroacetic  (DCA) protects mice from DNP-induced hyperlactacidemia, hyperthermia and death while preserving the ability of DNP to promote fuel oxidation and improve  sensitivity in mice. Mechanistically, PDH activation switches on mitochondrial glucose oxidation to accommodate increased glycolytic flux, leading to reduced lactate secretion during uncoupler treatments. We devised a chemical screening strategy and discovered compound 6j as a dual action compound that simultaneously activates PDH and uncouples mitochondrial respiration. Compound 6j exhibits excellent efficacy and safety profile in restoring glucose homeostasis in diabetic mice. This work establishes a new principle to safely harness the power of chemical uncouplers for the treatment of metabolic disease.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565055>First Report on Association of Hyperuricemia with Type 2 Diabetes in a Vietnamese Population.</a></h1><p>Uric  is a powerful free-radical scavenger in humans, but hyperuricemia may induce  and beta-cell dysfunction.

II. Pharmacokinetics, whole-animal performance, and lipid metabolism.</a></h1><p>Dairy cows cope with severe energy insufficiency in early lactation by engaging in intense and sustained mobilization of fatty  from adipose tissue. An unwanted side effect of this adaptation is excessive lipid accumulation in the liver, which in turn impairs hepatic functions. Mice experiencing increased hepatic fatty  flux are protected from this condition through coordinated actions of the newly described hormone fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) on liver and adipose tissue. The possibility of an analogous role for FGF21 in dairy cows is suggested by its rapid increase in plasma levels around parturition followed by chronically elevated levels in the first few weeks of lactation. To test this hypothesis, dairy cows were randomly assigned on d 12.6 ± 2.2 (± standard error) of lactation to receive either an excipient (control; n = 6) or recombinant human FGF21 (n = 7), first as an FGF21 bolus of 3 mg/kg of body weight (BW) followed 2 d later by a constant i.v. infusion of FGF21 at a rate of 6.3 mg/kg of metabolic BW for 9 consecutive days. After bolus administration, human FGF21 circulated with a half-life of 194 min, and its constant infusion increased total plasma concentration 117-fold over levels in excipient-infused cows. The FGF21 treatment had no effect on voluntary feed intake, milk yield, milk energy output, or net energy balance measured over the 9-d infusion or on final BW. Plasma fatty  circulated at lower concentrations in the FGF21 group than in the control group for the 8-h period following bolus administration, but this reduction was not significant during the period of constant i.v. infusion. Treatment with FGF21 caused a 50% reduction in triglyceride content in liver biopsies taken at the end of the constant i.v. infusion without altering the mRNA abundance of key genes involved in the transport, acyl coenzyme A activation, or oxidation of fatty . In contrast, FGF21 treatment ablated the recovery of plasma -like growth factor-1 seen in control cows during the 9-d i.v. infusion period despite a tendency for higher plasma growth hormone. This effect was associated with increased hepatic mRNA abundance of the intracellular inhibitor of growth hormone receptor trafficking, LEPROT. Overall, these data confirm the ability of FGF21 to reduce lipid accumulation in bovine liver and suggest the possibility that FGF21 does so by attenuating the hepatic influx of adipose tissue-derived fatty .Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

While the role of adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) pro-inflammatory signalling in the development of  has been established, it is less clear how WAT inflammation is initiated. Here, we show that ATMs isolated from obese mice and humans exhibit markers of increased rate of de novo phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis. Macrophage-specific knockout of phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase A (CCTα), the rate-limiting enzyme of de novo PC biosynthesis pathway, alleviated obesity-induced WAT inflammation and . Mechanistically, CCTα-deficient macrophages showed reduced ER stress and inflammation in response to palmitate. Surprisingly, this was not due to lower exogenous palmitate incorporation into cellular PCs. Instead, CCTα-null macrophages had lower membrane PC turnover, leading to elevated membrane polyunsaturated fatty  levels that negated the pro-inflammatory effects of palmitate.

This study was conducted in VDR-KO mice, VDR-Tg mice and wild-type mice. Energy metabolism was determined based on the energy expenditure, oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange rate, food and water intake, and a cool room test. VDR expression in the tissues of VDR-Tg mice was assessed by western blotting.

Our results show that overexpression of VDR in adipose tissue induced an increase in body weight, fat mass, and serum lipid levels, and a decline in energy metabolism; these changes were ameliorated by VDR-KO mice. Overexpression of VDR in the adipose tissue of VDR-Tg mice induced a state of , which corresponded with decreased expression of UCP1, UCP2, UCP3, CPT2 and HK in both white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue; these changes were also reversed by VDR-KO mice.

Visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT and SAT, respectively) biopsies were collected at baseline to determine mRNA levels for enzymes involved in BCAA catabolism.Before surgery, patients with obesity had lower BCFAs and greater BCAAs than control subjects. OAGB increased BCFA and decreased BCAA levels.  (assessed by HOMA) correlated inversely with BCFAs and positively with BCAAs. Expression of genes involved in BCAA catabolism in VAT (but not SAT) was lower in patients with obesity than in lean controls.OAGB-induced weight loss increases circulating BCFAs and decreases circulating BCAAs in patients with morbid obesity, perhaps by altering BCAA catabolism in VAT.

Fasted serum was collected from 49 participants (41 women) and analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS to quantify 45 sphingolipids. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool was performed to profile the gut microbiome.Confirming the link to deteriorated glucose homeostasis, serum ceramides were positively correlated with fasting glucose, but inversely correlated with fasting and OGTT-derived measures of  sensitivity and β-cell function. Significant associations with gut dysbiosis were demonstrated, with SM and ceramides being inversely correlated with gene richness. Ceramides with fatty  chain lengths of 20-24 carbons were the most associated with low richness. Diet-induced weight loss, which improved gene richness, decreased most sphingolipids. Thirty-one MGS, mostly corresponding to unidentified bacteria species, were inversely correlated with ceramides, including a number of Bifidobacterium and Methanobrevibacter smithii. Higher ceramide levels were also associated with increased metagenomic modules for lipopolysaccharide synthesis and flagellan synthesis, two pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and decreased enrichment of genes involved in methanogenesis and bile  metabolism.This study identifies an association between gut microbiota richness, ceramides, and diabetes risk in overweight/obese humans, and suggests that the gut microbiota may contribute to dysregulation of lipid metabolism in metabolic disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575938>Phenotypic and transcriptomic responses of two Nilaparvata lugens populations to the Mudgo rice containing Bph1.</a></h1><p>The Bph1 gene was the first reported brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens)  gene in Mudgo rice and was widely used as a commercial cultivar for controlling BPH infestations. However, rapid adaptations of BPH on the Mudgo rice resulted in its  breakdown and the emergence of virulent BPH populations. Thus, specific BPH populations and rice varieties can serve as good model systems for studying the roles of different bio-compounds and proteins in the insect-plant interactions. Although our understandings have been improved on the complexity of BPH and rice interactions, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we analyzed the feeding performances and the transcriptomic responses of two BPH populations (Mugdo-BPH and TN1-BPH) during compatible (Mudog-BPH feeding on Mudgo rice) and incompatible (TN1-BPH feeding on Mudgo rice) interactions. The electrical penetration graph (EPG) results indicated that the BPH feeding and performances during the incompatible interaction are significantly affected in terms of decreased honeydew, loss of weight, decreased phloem sap ingestion (N4 waveform), but increased non-penetration (NP waveform) phase. Abundance of glucose and trehalose was reduced in BPH during the incompatible interaction. Transcriptomic surveys of insects in both interactions revealed that genes involved in cuticle formation, detoxification, metabolite transport, digestion, RNA processing, lipid or fatty  metabolism, and proteolysis were significantly down-regulated during the incompatible interaction, whereas genes involved in  signaling were significantly upregulated.

Since the effect of empagliflozin or other SGLT2 inhibitors on the whole cardiac metabolic profile was never analysed before, and with the purpose to contribute to elucidate the benefits at cardiac level of the use of empagliflozin, we explored the effect of the treatment with empagliflozin for six weeks on the cardiac metabolomic profile of Zucker diabetic fatty rats, a model of early stage T2DM, using untargeted metabolomics approach. Empagliflozin reduced significantly the cardiac content of sphingolipids (ceramides and sphingomyelins) and glycerophospholipids (major bioactive contributing factors linking  to cardiac damage) and decreased the cardiac content of the fatty  transporter cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36); induced significant decreases of the cardiac levels of essential glycolysis intermediaries 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate, and regulated the abundance of several amino  of relevance as tricarboxylic  suppliers and/or in the metabolic control of the cardiac function as glutamic , gamma-aminobutyric  and sarcosine.

In 122 federally employed women without diabetes, 73 black (58 African American and 15 African immigrant) and 49 white; age 44{plus minus}10 (mean{plus minus}SD); BMI 30.0{plus minus}5.6 kg/m2 we measured lipoprotein subfractions using nuclear magnetic resonance. Hepatic fat was measured by proton MRS,  sensitivity index (SI) calculated by minimal modeling from a frequently-sampled intravenous glucose test, RBC fatty  profiles by gas chromatography were used to estimate SCD-1 indices. Hepatic fat, S, and SCD-1 were similar in black women and lower than in whites, regardless of menopausal status. Fasting and postprandial large, medium and small TRLPs, but not very small TRLPs, were lower in black women. Fasting large, medium and very small TRLPs negatively correlated with S and positively correlated with visceral and hepatic fat, and SCD-1 activity in both groups. In multivariate models, visceral fat and SCD-1 were associated with total fasting TRLP concentrations (adjR= 0.39, P=0.001). Black women had smaller postprandial changes in large (P=0.005) and medium TRLPs (P=0.007).  Lower visceral fat and SCD-1 activity may contribute to the paradoxical association of lower fasting and postprandial TRLP subfractions despite  in black compared to white pre- and post-menopausal women. Similar concentrations of very small TRLPs are related to  and could be important mediators of cardiometabolic disease risk in women.  .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514320>Serum Secretogranin III Concentrations Were Increased in Subjects with Metabolic Syndrome and Independently Associated with Fasting Plasma Glucose Levels.</a></h1><p>Secretogranin III (SCG3) plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of secretory granules in endocrine cells, and thus affects glucose homeostasis by regulating  secretion by pancreatic beta cells.  and compensatory hyperinsulinemia are hallmarks of metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, the role of SCG3 in MetS remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between serum SCG3 levels and metabolic parameters in subjects with and without MetS. This was a case control study, and 295 subjects were recruited. Serum SCG3 concentrations were compared between groups. Associations between SCG3 levels and clinico-metabolic parameters were also examined. We found serum SCG3 levels were higher in the MetS group than non-MetS group (122.6 ± 79.2 vs. 90.6 ± 58.5 nmol/L,  = 0.009). Specifically, elevated SCG3 levels were found in subjects with high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, central obesity, or hypertriglyceridemia. Additionally, MetS was an independent factor of serum SCG3 levels in multivariate linear regression analyses. Moreover, FPG, free fatty , and waist circumference were positively associated with serum SCG3 concentrations after adjusting for  levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and cardiovascular risk factors. In conclusion, serum SCG3 concentrations were higher in subjects with MetS and were independently associated with FPG levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555354>Upregulation of GABA receptor promotes long-term potentiation and depotentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region of mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</a></h1><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a long-term metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels,  and a relative lack of . A previous study has reported that an association exists between γ-aminobutyric  (GABA) and the hippocampus. The current study therefore aimed to assess the effect of the GABA receptor (GABA-R) on the long-term potentiation (LTP) and depotentiation of the hippocampal CA1 region in mice with T2DM. Mice were divided into four groups: A normal group consisting of healthy mice and a GABA-R, negative control and blank group all comprising T2DM mice. The weight and blood glucose level of all mice were measured and GABA-R mRNA and protein expression were detected. A hydroxyl free radical (OH-) kit was used to determine the hippocampal OH-content. Using an electrophysiological experiment, the population spike (PS) slope was observed every 5 min. The results revealed that as GABA-R levels increased, the weight, blood glucose level and OH content of the T2DM mice significantly decreased, and the neuron microstructures in the mice hippocampal tissue improved. The PS slope also significantly increased and the level of depotentiation improved. The results of the current study support the theory that the upregulation of GABA-R protects the neuronal ultrastructure and promotes LTP and depotentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region by inhibiting the accumulation of OH in T2DM mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666083>Predictive and diagnostic biomarkers for gestational diabetes and its associated metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.</a></h1><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as the presence of high blood glucose levels with the onset, or detected for the first time during pregnancy, as a result of increased . GDM may be induced by dysregulation of pancreatic β-cell function and/or by alteration of secreted gestational hormones and peptides related with glucose homeostasis. It may affect one out of five pregnancies, leading to perinatal morbidity and adverse neonatal outcomes, and high risk of chronic metabolic and cardiovascular injuries in both mother and offspring. Currently, GDM diagnosis is based on evaluation of glucose homeostasis at late stages of pregnancy, but increased age and body-weight, and familiar or previous occurrence of GDM, may conditionate this criteria. In addition, an earlier and more specific detection of GDM with associated metabolic and cardiovascular risk could improve GDM development and outcomes. In this sense, 1st-2nd trimester-released biomarkers found in maternal plasma including adipose tissue-derived factors such as adiponectin, visfatin, omentin-1, fatty -binding protein-4 and retinol binding-protein-4 have shown correlations with GDM development. Moreover, placenta-related factors such as sex hormone-binding globulin, afamin, fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factors-21/23, ficolin-3 and follistatin, or specific micro-RNAs may participate in GDM progression and be useful for its recognition. Finally, urine-excreted metabolites such as those related with serotonin system, non-polar amino- and ketone bodies, may complete a predictive or early-diagnostic panel of biomarkers for GDM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31484323>Indole-3-Acetic  Alleviates Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Mice via Attenuation of Hepatic Lipogenesis, and Oxidative and Inflammatory Stress.</a></h1><p>Recent evidences have linked indole-3-acetic  (IAA), a gut microbiota-derived metabolite from dietary tryptophan, with the  to liver diseases. However, data supporting IAA-mediated protection against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) from an in vivo study is lacking. In this study, we assessed the role of IAA in attenuating high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD in male C57BL/6 mice. Administration of IAA (50 mg/kg body weight) by intraperitoneal injection was found to alleviate HFD-induced elevation in fasting blood glucose and homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) index as well as plasma total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) activity. Histological examination further presented the protective effect of IAA on liver damage induced by HFD feeding. HFD-induced an increase in liver total triglycerides and cholesterol, together with the upregulation of genes related to lipogenesis including sterol regulatory element binding-protein 1 (Srebf1), steraroyl coenzyme decarboxylase 1 (Scd1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (Acaca), and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, mitochondrial (Gpam), which were mitigated by IAA treatment. The results of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malonaldehyde (MDA) level along with superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione (GSH) content in liver tissue evidenced the protection of IAA against HFD-induced oxidative stress. Additionally, IAA attenuated the inflammatory response of liver in mice exposed to HFD as shown by the reduction in the F4/80-positive macrophage infiltration and the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). In conclusion, our findings uncover that IAA alleviates HFD-induced hepatotoxicity in mice, which proves to be associated with the amelioration in , lipid metabolism, and oxidative and inflammatory stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678493>Identification of a subset of trace amine-associated receptors and ligands as potential modulators of  secretion.</a></h1><p>The worldwide prevalence of diabetes has reached 8.5% among adults, and this is characterised by elevated glucose concentrations and failing  secretion. Furthermore, most people with type 2 diabetes are either obese or overweight, with the associated dyslipidaemia contributing to the development of  and increased cardiovascular risk. Here we incubated INS-1 pancreatic β-cells for 72h in RPMI-1640 media, or media supplemented with 28mM glucose, 200µM palmitic , and 200µM oleic  as a cellular model of diabetic glucolipotoxicity. Illumina HiSeq gene expression analysis showed the trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) family to be among the most highly downregulated by glucolipotoxicity. Importantly, MetaCore integrated knowledge database, from Clarivate Analytics, indicated potential TAAR impact on  secretion through adenylyl cyclase signalling pathways. We therefore investigated the effect of TAAR ligands on cAMP signalling and  secretion, and found that only the branch of the TAAR family tree that is activated by isopentylamine, 2-phenylethylamine, p-tyramine, and agmatine significantly increased intracellular cAMP and resulted in increased  secretion from INS-1 cells and primary mouse islets under normal conditions. Crucially however, this enhancement was not evident when the receptor family was downregulated by glucolipotoxic conditions. This data indicates that a subset of TAARs are regulators of  secretion in pancreatic β-cells, and that their downregulation contributes to glucolipotoxic inhibition of  secretion. As such they may be potential targets for treatment of type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Most studies revealed that the MetS is accompanied with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and . It can be said that, in treating or preventing the MetS and its components, lifestyle adjustment and weight loss have a vital role. According to various studies, among natural compounds, celery (Apium graveolens) is one of the most important sources of phytochemicals such as phenolic , flavones, flavonols, and antioxidants such as vitamin C, beta-carotene (Provitamin A), and manganese. These antioxidants have a role in decreasing the oxidative damage. The phytochemicals in celery decrease the activity of proinflammatory cytokines and prevent inflammation. Also, flavonoids in celery suppress cardiovascular inflammation. Oxidative stress and inflammation in the blood stream are the main risk factors in increasing cardiovascular disease, especially atherosclerosis.

Nevertheless, the concentration of these molecules has not been systematically addressed in pregnant women.This meta-analysis is aimed at evaluating the difference in free fatty  plasma levels between women with gestational diabetes and healthy pregnant controls and their intrinsic and extrinsic determinants.We performed a systematic search to find relevant studies published in English and Spanish using PubMed, SCOPUS, and ISI Web of Knowledge. We included observational studies measuring the mean plasma levels of free fatty  among gestational diabetes and healthy pregnant women, with at least ten subjects being analyzed in each group. The standardized mean difference (SMD) by random effects modeling was used. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's , , and   statistics.Among the 290 identified studies, twelve were selected for analysis. A total of 2426 women were included, from which 21% were diagnosed as having gestational diabetes. There were significantly higher levels of free fatty  among women with gestational diabetes (SMD: 0.86; 0.54-1.18;  < 0.001) when compared to healthy pregnant controls and between-study heterogeneity (  = 91%). The metaregression analysis showed that the gestational age at inclusion was the only cofactor influencing the mean levels of free fatty , indicating a trend towards lower plasma levels of free fatty  later in gestation (estimate: -0.074; -0.143 to -0.004;  = 0.036). No significant publication bias was found nor a trend towards greater results in small studies.Women with gestational diabetes have higher levels of free fatty  when compared to healthy pregnant controls.

The aim of this study was to determine the FA profile and pro-antioxidant status in sarcopenic frail elderly patients enrolled in a nutritional and physical activity program and to evaluate their correlation with clinical markers. Moreover, the possible changes, produced after a short-term clinical protocol, were evaluated. Plasma and erythrocyte FA composition and pro-antioxidant status were analyzed in sarcopenic elderly subjects recruited for the randomized clinical study and treated with a placebo or dietary supplement, a personalized diet, and standardized physical activity. Subjects were tested before and after 30 days of treatment. Pearson correlations between biochemical parameters and patients' characteristics at recruitment indicate interesting features of sarcopenic status such as negative correlation among the plasma FA profile, age, and physical characteristics. Physical activity and dietetic program alone for 30 days induced a decrease of saturated FA concentration with a significant increase of dihomo-gamma-linolenic . Supplementation plus physical activity induced a significant decrease of linoleic , omega-6 polyunsaturated FAs, and an increase of stearic and oleic  concentration. Moreover, glutathione reductase activity, which is an indicator of antioxidant status, significantly increased in erythrocytes. Changes over time between groups indicate significant differences for saturated FAs, which suggest that the amino  supplementation restores FA levels that are consumed during physical activity. A relationship between FA and clinical/metabolic status revealed unique correlations and a specific metabolic and lipidomic fingerprint in sarcopenic elderly.

Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a principle intracellular energy sensor exerting protective effect against T2D. Strikingly, compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK, considerably inhibited the secretion of IL-1β when THP-1 cells were stimulated with LPS plus palmitic  (PA). The underlying mechanism was examined with respect to the effect of compound C on NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex which controls the processing and production of IL-1β. Interestingly, compound C significantly attenuated the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. This phenomenon was reproduced in AMPK siRNA-transfected THP-1 cells, indicating that compound C exerts this function despite AMPK knockdown. Also, it significantly suppresses the mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In conclusion, compound C was shown to significantly attenuate the NLRP3 inflammasome despite AMPK knockdown, rendering it as the novel target of compound C. Potentially, compound C attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome through the suppression of mitochondrial ROS production. These findings offer initial evidence into compound C as a novel pharmacological agent with significant therapeutic potential in NLRP3 inflammasome-related disorders, including obesity, , and T2D.

NAFLD is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity and cardiovascular disease and begins with intrahepatic triacylglycerol accumulation. Under healthy conditions, the liver regulates lipid metabolism to meet systemic energy needs in the fed and fasted states. The processes of fatty  uptake, fatty  synthesis and the intracellular partitioning of fatty  into storage, oxidation and secretion pathways are tightly regulated. When one or more of these processes becomes dysregulated, excess lipid accumulation can occur. Although genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the development of NAFLD, it remains unclear why an imbalance in these pathways begins. The regulation of fatty  partitioning occurs at several points, including during triacylglycerol synthesis, lipid droplet formation and lipolysis. These processes are influenced by enzyme function, intake of dietary fats and sugars and whole-body metabolism, and are further affected by the presence of obesity or .

This association has been demonstrated in multiple adult and pediatric cohorts. The mechanistic link explaining this association is the pattern of lipid partitioning in the face of excess calories and energy surplus. A tight relation exists between typical lipid deposition patterns, specifically within the skeletal muscle and liver, as well as the intra-abdominal compartment and whole body  sensitivity. The impact of lipid deposition within  responsive tissues such as the liver and skeletal muscle relates to the ability of fatty  derivates to inhibit elements of the  signal transduction pathway. Strengthening the relation of obesity and reduced  sensitivity are the observations that weight gain reduces  sensitivity while weight loss increases it. This manifests as the appearance of cardiovascular risk factor clustering with weight gain and its recovery in the face of weight loss. Both obesity , via the adipocytokine profile it induces, and low  sensitivity, are independent determinants of the adverse metabolic phenotype characteristic of the metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553330>Characteristics of amino  profile and incretin hormones in patients with gallstone disease - a pilot study.</a></h1><p>Gallstone disease is associated with , type 2 diabetes mellitus and increased risk of incident ischemic heart disease.

While prolonged HFD-induced metabolic complications are partly mediated by increased food intake during the light (inactive) phase, such a link has not yet been established in short-term HFD-fed mice. Herein, we hypothesized that a short bout of HFD desynchronizes feeding behavior, thereby contributing to glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis. To this end, 12-wk-old C57BL/6J littermates were fed a HFD for 4 days either ad libitum or intermittently. Intermittent-fed mice were fasted for 8 h during their inactive phase. Initiation of HFD led to an immediate increase in food intake already during the first light phase. Moreover, glucose tolerance was significantly impaired in ad libitum- but not in intermittent HFD-fed mice, indicating that desynchronized feeding behavior contributes to short-term HFD-induced glucose intolerance. Of note, overall food intake was similar between the groups, as was body weight. However, intermittent HFD-fed mice revealed higher fat depot weights. Phosphorylation of hormone sensitivity lipase and free fatty  release from isolated adipocytes were significantly elevated, suggesting increased lipolysis in intermittent HFD-fed mice. Moreover, hepatic mRNA expression of lipogenetic enzymes and liver triglyceride levels were significantly increased in intermittent HFD-fed mice. Importantly, food deprivation decreased respiratory exchange ratio promptly in intermittent- but not in ad libitum HFD-fed mice. In conclusion, retaining a normal feeding pattern prevented HFD-induced impairment of metabolic flexibility in short-term HFD-fed mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584131>Circulating metabolites and the risk of type 2 diabetes: a prospective study of 11,896 young adults from four Finnish cohorts.</a></h1><p>Metabolomics technologies have identified numerous blood biomarkers for type 2 diabetes risk in case-control studies of middle-aged and older individuals. We aimed to validate existing and identify novel metabolic biomarkers predictive of future diabetes in large cohorts of young adults.NMR metabolomics was used to quantify 229 circulating metabolic measures in 11,896 individuals from four Finnish observational cohorts (baseline age 24-45 years). Associations between baseline metabolites and risk of developing diabetes during 8-15 years of follow-up (392 incident cases) were adjusted for sex, age, BMI and fasting glucose. Prospective metabolite associations were also tested with fasting glucose, 2 h glucose and HOMA-IR at follow-up.Out of 229 metabolic measures, 113 were associated with incident type 2 diabetes in meta-analysis of the four cohorts (ORs per 1 SD: 0.59-1.50; p< 0.0009). Among the strongest biomarkers of diabetes risk were branched-chain and aromatic amino  (OR 1.31-1.33) and triacylglycerol within VLDL particles (OR 1.33-1.50), as well as linoleic n-6 fatty  (OR 0.75) and non-esterified cholesterol in large HDL particles (OR 0.59). The metabolic biomarkers were more strongly associated with deterioration in post-load glucose and  than with future fasting hyperglycaemia. A multi-metabolite score comprised of phenylalanine, non-esterified cholesterol in large HDL and the ratio of cholesteryl ester to total lipid in large VLDL was associated with future diabetes risk (OR 10.1 comparing individuals in upper vs lower fifth of the multi-metabolite score) in one of the cohorts (mean age 31 years).Metabolic biomarkers across multiple molecular pathways are already predictive of the long-term risk of diabetes in young adults. Comprehensive metabolic profiling may help to target preventive interventions for young asymptomatic individuals at increased risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480627>Lyophilized Maqui () Berry Induces Browning in the Subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue and Ameliorates the  in High Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h1><p>Maqui () berry features a unique profile of anthocyanidins that includes high amounts of delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside-5-O-glucoside and delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside and has shown positive effects on fasting glucose and  levels in humans and murine models of type 2 diabetes and obesity. The molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of maqui on the onset and development of the obese phenotype and  was investigated in high fat diet-induced obese mice supplemented with a lyophilized maqui berry. Maqui-dietary supplemented animals showed better  response and decreased weight gain but also a differential expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis, fatty  oxidation, multilocular lipid droplet formation and thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT). These changes correlated with an increased expression of the carbohydrate response element binding protein b (), the sterol regulatory binding protein 1c () and Cellular repressor of adenovirus early region 1A-stimulated genes 1 () and an improvement in the fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) signaling. Our evidence suggests that maqui dietary supplementation activates the induction of fuel storage and thermogenesis characteristic of a brown-like phenotype in scWAT and counteracts the unhealthy metabolic impact of an HFD. This induction constitutes a putative strategy to prevent/treat diet-induced obesity and its associated comorbidities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612510>Potential roles of Citrulline and watermelon extract on metabolic and inflammatory variables in diabetes mellitus, current evidence and future directions: A systematic review.</a></h1><p>Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent endocrine disorder worldwide. Citrulline is an α-amino , which is abundant in watermelon, and a precursor of arginine and nitric oxide. Decreased bioavailability of nitric oxide is associated with . The present systematic review focused on the existing evidence of citrulline and watermelon extract effects on metabolic and inflammatory parameters in diabetes mellitus.A systematic search of the databases PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, ProQuest and Google Scholar was conducted for relevant papers published from inception until October 2018. All clinical trials, animal and in vitro studies published in English-language that assessed the role of citrulline and watermelon extract on diabetes mellitus, were eligible. Studies providing inadequate information were excluded.Out of 1262 articles we found, only 8 articles met the inclusion criteria for analysis. In three studies an increase in the synthesis of nitric oxide was reported with citrulline and watermelon extract supplementation. Four studies showed a significant reduction in blood glucose after supplementation with watermelon extract, and two studies reported a decrease in a number of inflammatory biomarkers following citrulline supplementation. Although citrulline intake caused a significant reduction in HOMA-IR in one study, inconsistent results were revealed on the effects of citrulline and watermelon extract on  levels and lipid profile.Citrulline and watermelon extract could improve nitric oxide synthesis, glycemic status and inflammation in diabetes mellitus. However, further studies are required to shed light on the underlying mechanisms.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598849>TLR4 knockout can improve dysfunction of β-cell by rebalancing proteomics disorders in pancreas of obese rats.</a></h1><p>Studies showed that TLR4 knockout (TLR4) could mitigate obesity and  induced by high-fat diet in rats. In this study, we further investigated the effects of TLR4 on islet function and pancreatic proteomics in obese rats by high-fat diet.PA-induced lipotoxicity β-cells, SD and TLR4 rats were used in this study. iTRAQ was used to screen out meaningful differential proteins.The protein expression level was evaluated by Western blotting; the cell apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay.TLR4 could reduce inflammatory and regulate body composition in obese rats, and improve β-cells function. The quantitative analysis of protein revealed that TLR4 rebalanced proteomics disorders in pancreas of obese rats. In addition, the pathways involved in differential proteins were mainly metabolic pathways, arachidonic  metabolism, ECM-receptor interaction, pancreatic secretion, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and FoxO signaling pathway. Further analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) revealed that Stk39 and Ass1 interacting through Mapk14-Ywhae were node proteins and participated in inflammatory response, carboxylic  metabolic process, and small molecule metabolic process. In vitro experiments we confirmed that silencing TLR4 can inhibit PA-induced β-cell apoptosis,  secretion disorders, and increase Ass1 expression. While, overexpression of Ass1 in β-cell inhibited PA or LPS-induced β-cell damage.Our study confirmed that TLR4 could improve dysfunction of β-cell, and the underlying mechanism might be involved in ebalancing proteomics disorders in pancreas, affecting the expression of Ass1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608010>Mechanisms Underlying Type 2 Diabetes Remission After Metabolic Surgery.</a></h1><p>Type 2 diabetes prevalence is increasing dramatically worldwide. Metabolic surgery is the most effective treatment for selected patients with diabetes and/or obesity. When compared to intensive medical therapy and lifestyle intervention, metabolic surgery has shown superiority in achieving glycemic improvement, reducing number of medications and cardiovascular risk factors, which translates in long-term benefits on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms underlying diabetes improvement after metabolic surgery have not yet been clearly understood but englobe a complex interaction among improvements in beta cell function and  secretion,  sensitivity, intestinal gluconeogenesis, changes in glucose utilization, and absorption by the gut and changes in the secretory pattern and morphology of adipose tissue. These are achieved through different mediators which include an enhancement in gut hormones release, especially, glucagon-like peptide 1, changes in bile  circulation, gut microbiome, and glucose transporters expression. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive appraisal of what is known so far to better understand the mechanisms through which metabolic surgery improves glycemic control facilitating future research in the field.Copyright © 2019 Pérez-Pevida, Escalada, Miras and Frühbeck.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467335>Arterio-venous metabolomics exploration reveals major changes across liver and intestine in the obese Yucatan minipig.</a></h1><p>Blood circulation mainly aims at distributing the nutrients required for tissue metabolism and collecting safely the by-products of all tissues to be further metabolized or eliminated. The simultaneous study of arterial (A) and venous (V) specific metabolites therefore has appeared to be a more relevant approach to understand and study the metabolism of a given organ. We propose to implement this approach by applying a metabolomics (NMR) strategy on paired AV blood across the intestine and liver on high fat/high sugar (HFHS)-fed minipigs. Our objective was to unravel kinetically and sequentially the metabolic adaptations to early obesity/ onset specifically on these two tissues. After two months of HFHS feeding our study of AV ratios of the metabolome highlighted three major features. First, the hepatic metabolism switched from carbohydrate to lipid utilization. Second, the energy demand of the intestine increased, resulting in an enhanced uptake of glutamine, glutamate, and the recruitment of novel energy substrates (choline and creatine). Third, the uptake of methionine and threonine was considered to be driven by an increased intestine turnover to cope with the new high-density diet. Finally, the unique combination of experimental data and modelling predictions suggested that HFHS feeding was associated with changes in tryptophan metabolism and fatty  β-oxidation, which may play an important role in lipid hepatic accumulation and  sensitivity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581129>Hyperinsulinemia: does it tip the balance toward intrahepatic fat accumulation?</a></h1><p>In health, the liver is metabolically flexible over the course of the day, as it undertakes a multitude of physiological processes including the regulation of intrahepatic and systemic glucose and lipid levels. The liver is the first organ to receive  and through a cascade of complex series of steps,  not only plays a key role in the intrahepatic regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism but also in the regulation of systemic glucose and lipid concentrations. Thus, when intra-hepatic  signalling becomes aberrant then this may lead to perturbations in intra-hepatic metabolic processes that have the potential to impact on metabolic health. For example, obesity is associated with intra-hepatic fat accumulation (known as non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD)) and hyperinsulinaemia, the latter as a result of  hypersecretion or impaired hepatic  extraction. Although  signalling directly alters intra- and extra-hepatic metabolism, the regulation of hepatic glucose and fatty  metabolism is also indirectly driven by substrate availability. Here we discuss the direct and indirect effects of  on intrahepatic processes such as the synthesis of fatty  and peripherally regulating the flux of fatty  to the liver; processes that may play a role in the development of  and/or IHTAG accumulation in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415760>Oxidative stress induced by palmitic  modulates K2.3 channels in vascular endothelium.</a></h1><p>Elevated plasma free fatty  level has been implicated in the development of , inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. However, the underlying mechanisms still remain to be defined. Herein, we investigated the effect of palmitic  (PA), the most abundant saturated fatty  in the human body, on small-conductance Ca-activated potassium channels (K2.3)-mediated relaxation in rodent  arteries and the underlying molecular mechanism. The effect of PA on K2.3 in endothelium was evaluated using real-time PCR, Western blotting, whole-cell patch voltage-clamp, wire and pressure myograph system, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by using dihydroethidium and 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. K2.3-mediated vasodilatation responses to acetylcholine and NS309 (agonist of K2.3 and K3.1) were impaired by incubation of normal mesenteric arteries with 100 μM PA for 24 h. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), PA decreased K2.3 current and expression at mRNA and protein levels. Incubation with the NADPH oxidase (Nox) inhibitor dibenziodolium (DPI) partly inhibited the PA-induced ROS production and restored K2.3 expression. Inhibition of either p38-MAPK or NF-κB using specific inhibitors (SB203580, SB202190 or Bay11-7082, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate) attenuated PA-induced downregulation of K2.3 and inhibition of p38-MAPK also attenuated PA-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. Furthermore, DPI reversed the increment of phospho-p38-MAPK by PA. These results demonstrated that PA downregulated K2.3 expressions via Nox/ROS/p38-MAPK/NF-κB signaling leading to endothelial vasodilatory dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigated whether exercise intensity modulates the hepatokine response to acute exercise. Ten young, healthy men undertook three 8-h experimental trials: moderate-intensity exercise (MOD; 55% peak oxygen uptake), high-intensity exercise (HIGH; 75% peak oxygen uptake), and control (CON; rest), in a randomised, counterbalanced order. Exercise trials commenced with a treadmill run of varied duration to match gross exercise energy expenditure between trials (MOD vs HIGH; 2475 ± 70 vs 2488 ± 58 kJ). Circulating FGF21, follistatin, LECT2, glucagon, , glucose and nonesterified fatty  (NEFA) were measured before exercise and at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7 h postexercise. Plasma FGF21 concentrations were increased up to 4 h postexercise compared with CON ( ≤ 0.022) with greater increases observed at 1, 2, and 4 h postexercise during HIGH versus MOD ( ≤ 0.025). Irrespective of intensity ( ≥ 0.606), plasma follistatin concentrations were elevated at 4 and 7 h postexercise ( ≤ 0.053). Plasma LECT2 concentrations were increased immediately postexercise ( ≤ 0.046) but were not significant after correcting for plasma volume shifts. Plasma glucagon (1 h;  = 0.032) and NEFA (4 and 7 h;  ≤ 0.029) responses to exercise were accentuated in HIGH versus MOD. These findings demonstrate that acute exercise augments circulating FGF21 and follistatin. Exercise-induced changes in FGF21 are intensity-dependent and may support the greater metabolic benefit of high-intensity exercise.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554925>Over-expression of miR-34c leads to early-life visceral fat accumulation and .</a></h1><p>Overweight children and adolescents are at high risk for adult and late life obesity. This report investigates some underlying mechanisms contributing to obesity during early life in an animal model. We generated a strain of transgenic mice, cU2, overexpressing human microRNA 34c, a microRNA functionally implicated in adipogenesis. Male and female cU2 mice exhibit significant weight gain, accompanied by marked increase in abdominal fat mass and metabolic abnormalities, including reduction of both glucose clearance rate and  sensitivity, as early as two months of age. Adipogenesis derailment at this early age is suggested by decreased expression of adiponectin, the fat mass and obesity-associated gene, and the adiponectin receptor R1, coupled with a reduction of the brown fat biomarker PAT2 and the adipogenesis inhibitor SIRT1. Notably, adiponectin is an important adipokine and an essential regulator of glucose and fatty  homeostasis. cU2 mice may provide a crucial animal model for investigating the role of miR-34c in early onset  and visceral fat mass increase, contributing to accelerated body weight gain and metabolic disorders. Intervention in this dysregulation may open a new preventive strategy to control early-life weight gain and abnormal , and thus prevalent adult and late life obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554919>Plasma metabolites associated with homeostatic model assessment of : metabolite-model design and external validation.</a></h1><p>Different plasma metabolites have been related to  (IR).

The aim of this study is to identify a multi-metabolite model associated to the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-IR values. We performed a cross-sectional metabolomics analysis of samples collected from overweight and obese subjects from two independent studies. The training step was performed in 236 subjects from the SATIN study and validated in 102 subjects from the GLYNDIET study. Plasma metabolomics profile was analyzed using three different approaches: GC/quadrupole-TOF, LC/quadrupole-TOF, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Associations between metabolites and HOMA-IR were assessed using elastic net regression analysis with a leave-one-out cross validation (CV) and 100 CV runs. HOMA-IR was analyzed both as linear and categorical (median or lower versus higher than the median). Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed based on metabolites' weighted models. A set of 30 metabolites discriminating extremes of HOMA-IR were consistently selected. These metabolites comprised some amino , lipid species and different organic . The area under the curve (AUC) for the discrimination between HOMA-IR extreme categories was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.74-0.90), based on the multi-metabolite model weighted with the regression coefficients of metabolites in the validation dataset. We identified a set of metabolites discriminating between extremes of HOMA-IR and able to predict HOMA-IR with high accuracy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450982>Butyrolactone-I, an efficient α-glucosidase inhibitor, improves type 2 diabetes with potent TNF-α-lowering properties through modulating gut microbiota in db/db mice.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of butyrolactone-I (A6) on type 2 diabetes (T2D) in db/db mice because A6 was found to inhibit α-glucosidase activities and TNF-α release, which were associated with improving T2D. Male db/db mice were divided into 6 groups and given an equivalent volume of olive oil, acarbose, or different doses of A6 for 4 wk ( = 8/group).

We found a correlation between 2-aminoadipic  (2-AAA) and adipogenic differentiation. Also, circulatory 2-AAA was positively associated with obesity-related factors (fat mass, fat percent, waist circumference, BMI, BMI z-score, triglycerides, , and HOMA-IR) at baseline and after 2 years in the children cohort study. Of these factors, increased BMI z-score and HOMA-IR were the primary independent factors associated with higher 2-AAA levels, and the baseline 2-AAA level was an indicator of the BMI z-score after 2 years. To validate the relationship between 2-AAA and obesity-related factors, we analyzed changes in 2-AAA levels following obesity intervention programs in two independent studies. In both studies, changes in 2-AAA levels during the intervention period were positively correlated with changes in the BMI z-score and HOMA-IR after adjusting for confounders. Moreover, the 2-AAA levels were increased in cell and mouse models of obesity-related . Excess 2-AAA levels led to impaired  signaling in -sensitive cells (liver, skeletal muscle and adipose cells) and caused abnormal gluconeogenesis.

Current dietary guidelines discourage the consumption of saturated fat and dietary sources rich in saturated fat, such as dairy products, despite data suggesting that full-fat dairy consumption is protective against metabolic syndrome. This narrative review assessed the recent epidemiological and clinical research that examined the consumption of dairy-derived saturated fatty  (SFA) on metabolic syndrome risk. In addition, this review evaluated studies of individual SFA to gain insight into the potential mechanisms at play with intake of a diet enriched with these dairy-derived fatty . This work underscores that SFA are a heterogenous class of fatty  that can differ considerably in their biological activity within the body depending on their length and specific chemical structure. In summary, previous work on the impact of dairy-derived SFA consumption on disease risk suggests that there is currently insufficient evidence to support current dietary guidelines which consolidate all dietary SFA into a single group of nutrients whose consumption should be reduced, regardless of dietary source, food matrix, and composition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31484696>Four nights of sleep restriction suppress the postprandial lipemic response and decrease satiety.</a></h1><p>Chronic sleep restriction, or inadequate sleep, is associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic disease. Laboratory studies demonstrate that sleep restriction causes impaired whole-body  sensitivity and glucose disposal. Evidence suggests that inadequate sleep also impairs adipose tissue  sensitivity and the NEFA rebound during intravenous glucose tolerance tests, yet no studies have examined the effects of sleep restriction on high-fat meal lipemia. We assessed the effect of 5 h time in bed (TIB) per night for four consecutive nights on postprandial lipemia following a standardized high-fat dinner (HFD). Furthermore, we assessed whether one night of recovery sleep (10 h TIB) was sufficient to restore postprandial metabolism to baseline. We found that postprandial triglyceride (TG) area under the curve was suppressed by sleep restriction ( = 0.01), but returned to baseline values following one night of recovery. Sleep restriction decreased NEFAs throughout the HFD ( = 0.02) and NEFAs remained suppressed in the recovery condition ( = 0.04). Sleep restriction also decreased participant-reported fullness or satiety ( = 0.03), and decreased postprandial interleukin-6 ( < 0.01). Our findings indicate that four nights of 5 h TIB per night impair postprandial lipemia and that one night of recovery sleep may be adequate for recovery of TG metabolism, but not for markers of adipocyte function.Copyright © 2019 Ness et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678325>Extracellular vesicles as an emerging tool for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a series of interacting pathophysiological cascades, including the aggregation of β-amyloid plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles derived from hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. AD is the cause of approximately 70% of dementia, an irreversible and untreatable syndrome at its late stage.

These models are generated by manipulating the diet of either the animal itself, or its mother during her pregnancy, and in comparison to traditional genetic and knock out models, have the advantage that they more accurately reflect the etiology of human T2DM. This chapter will discuss some of the most widely used nutritional models of T2DM: Diet-induced obesity (DIO) in adult rodents, and studies of offspring of mothers fed a low-protein, high-fat and/or high-sugar diet during pregnancy and/or lactation. Several common mechanisms have been identified through which these nutritional manipulations can lead to metabolic disease, including pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, impaired  signaling in skeletal muscle, and the excess accumulation of visceral adipose tissue and consequent deposition of nonesterified fatty  in peripheral tissues. In addition, there is an emerging concept that obesity/poor quality diets result in increased production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from adipose tissue leading to a state of chronic low-grade inflammation, and that this is likely to represent an important link between obesity/diet and metabolic dysfunction. The following chapter will discuss the most common nutritional models of T2DM in experimental animals, their application, and relationship to human etiology, and will highlight the important insights these models have provided into the pathogenesis of T2DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586692>Anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic effects of a special fraction of Luohanguo extract on obese T2DM rats.</a></h1><p>Luohanguo (LHG), a traditional Chinese medicine, could clear heat, moisten the lung, soothe the throat, restore the voice, and lubricate intestine and open the bowels. LHG has been utilized for the treatment of sore throats and hyperglycemia in folk medicine as a homology of medicine and food. The hypoglycemic pharmacology of LHG has attracted considerable attention, and mogrosides have been considered to be active ingredients against diabetes mellitus. We have found that these mogrosides could be metabolized into their secondary glycosides containing 1-3 glucose residues in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats in previous studies. These metabolites may be the antidiabetic components of LHG in vivo. Thus far, no reports have been found on reducing blood glucose of mogrosides containing 1-3 glucose residues.The aim of this study was to confirm that mogrosides containing 1-3 glucose residues were the active components of LHG for antidiabetic effects and to understand their potential mechanisms of action.First, the special fraction of mogrosides containing 1-3 glucose residues was separated from a 50% ethanol extract of LHG, and the chemical components were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and named low-polar Siraitia grosvenorii glycosides (L-SGgly). Second, the antidiabetic effects of L-SGgly were evaluated by HFD/STZ-induced (high-fat diet and streptozocin) obese T2DM rats by indexing fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting  (FINS), and , and then compared with other fractions in the separation process. The changes in serum lipid levels were also detected. Finally, possible mechanisms of antidiabetic activity of L-SGgly were identified as increasing GLP-1 levels and activating liver AMPK in T2DM rats.The chemical analysis of L-SGgly showed that they contain 11-oxomogroside V, mogroside V, mogroside III, mogroside IIE, mogroside IIIA, mogroside IIA, and mogroside IA, respectively. The total content of the mogrosides in L-SGgly was 54.4%, including 15.7% mogroside IIA and 12.6% mogroside IA. L-SGgly showed excellent effects on obese T2DM rats compared with the other fractions of LHG extract, including significantly reducing the levels of FBG (p < 0.001) and modifying  (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, they could significantly decrease the content of triglyceride (p < 0.01), total cholesterol (p < 0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.01) and free fatty  (p < 0.001) and increase the content of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.001) in serum of T2DM rats. Moreover, L-SGgly can significantly increase (p < 0.01) GLP-1 levels and decrease (p < 0.01) IL-6 levels in T2DM rat serum. AMPK-activating activity in T2DM rats was also upregulated by L-SGgly, but no statistical significance was shown.L-SGgly, fractions separated from LHG extract, were verified to have obvious anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic effects on T2DM rats. Furthermore, L-SGgly regulated  secretion in T2DM rats by increasing GLP-1 levels. These findings provide an explanation for the antidiabetic role of LHG.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.
