This study focuses on the adverse effects of oral supplementation of 1.3% LC in ApoE mice and whether the parenteral administration of LC (subcutaneously, sub) has any impact on the development of atherosclerosis.Mice are randomly divided into three groups (n = 15). All mice are fed a high- diet (HFD). The number of Ly6C monocytes; degree of atherosclerosis; plasma LC, γ-butyrobetaine (γBB), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) levels; and microbial community composition are analyzed. Compared with the HFD and HFD ± LC (sub) groups, the number of Ly6C monocytes, atherosclerotic plaque area, and plasma γBB and TMAO levels are increased in the HFD ± LC (oral) group (p < 0.001). Plasma LC levels in the HFD ± LC (sub) group are higher than those in other groups. The levels of γBB, TMAO, and Ly6C monocytes are positively correlated with atherosclerotic plaque area (p < 0.01), and TMAO is positively correlated with Bacteroidetes and negatively correlated with Firmicutes at the phylum level.In contrast with oral LC administration, subcutaneous LC administration, which bypasses its conversion to TMAO in the liver, does not have a detrimental effect on the development of atherosclerosis in male ApoE mice. Taking LC parenterally may be preferable among patients who require LC supplementation.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Elevated acylcarnitine levels are found in obese, insulin resistant humans and rodents, and coincide with lower free carnitine. We hypothesized that increasing free carnitine levels by administration of the carnitine precursor γ-butyrobetaine (γBB) could facilitate FAO, thereby improving insulin sensitivity.C57BL/6N mice were fed with a high  or chow diet with or without γBB supplementation (n=10 per group). After 8weeks of diet, indirect calorimetry, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity tests were performed. AC profiles and carnitine biosynthesis intermediates were analyzed in plasma and tissues by tandem mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography tandem MS.γBB supplementation did not facilitate FAO, was unable to curb bodyweight and did not prevent impaired glucose homeostasis in the HFD fed mice in spite of marked alterations in the acylcarnitine profiles in plasma and liver. Remarkably, γBB did not affect the acylcarnitine profile in other tissues, most notably muscle. Administration of a bolus acetylcarnitine also caused significant changes in plasma and liver, but not in muscle acylcarnitine profiles, again without effect on glucose tolerance.Altogether, increasing carnitine availability affects acylcarnitine profiles in plasma and liver but does not modulate glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity. This may be due to the lack of an effect on muscle acylcarnitine profiles, as muscle tissue is an important contributor to whole body insulin sensitivity. These results warrant caution on making associations between plasma acylcarnitine levels and insulin resistance.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Considering that the carnitine doses in these mice studies were up to 100 times higher than those used in clinical studies, the present study aimed to address possible safety concerns associated with long-term supplementation of a carnitine dose used in clinical trials. Two groups of NMRI mice were fed either a control or a carnitine-supplemented diet (1 g/kg diet) from weaning to 19 months of age, and parameters of hepatic  and stress signalling and skeletal muscle gene expression were analysed in the mice at 19 months of age. Concentrations of free carnitine and acetylcarnitine in plasma and tissues were higher in the carnitine than in the control group (P&lt;0·05). Plasma concentrations of free carnitine and acetylcarnitine were higher in mice at adult age (10 and 15 months) than at advanced age (19 months) (P&lt;0·05). Hepatic mRNA and protein levels of genes involved in  and stress signalling and hepatic and plasma  concentrations did not differ between the carnitine and the control group. Skeletal muscle transcriptome analysis in 19-month-old mice revealed only a moderate regulation between carnitine and control group. Lifelong carnitine supplementation prevents an age-dependent impairment of plasma carnitine status, but safety concerns associated with long-term supplementation of carnitine at doses used in clinical trials can be considered as unfounded.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26458767>Quantitative acylcarnitine determination by UHPLC-MS/MS--Going beyond tandem MS acylcarnitine "profiles".</a></h2><p>Tandem MS "profiling" of acylcarnitines and amino acids was conceived as a first-tier screening method, and its application to expanded newborn screening has been enormously successful. However, unlike amino acid screening (which uses amino acid analysis as its second-tier validation of screening results), acylcarnitine "profiling" also assumed the role of second-tier validation, due to the lack of a generally accepted second-tier acylcarnitine determination method. In this report, we present results from the application of our validated UHPLC-MS/MS second-tier method for the quantification of total carnitine, free carnitine, butyrobetaine, and acylcarnitines to patient samples with known diagnoses: malonic acidemia, short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD) or isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (IBD), 3-methyl-crotonyl carboxylase deficiency (3-MCC) or ß-ketothiolase deficiency (BKT), and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA). We demonstrate the assay's ability to separate constitutional isomers and diastereomeric acylcarnitines and generate values with a high level of accuracy and precision. These capabilities are unavailable when using tandem MS "profiles". We also show examples of research interest, where separation of acylcarnitine species and accurate and precise acylcarnitine quantification is necessary.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Resistant starches (RS) alter the human microbiota. We sought to determine whether diets varying in RS and carbohydrate (CHO) content affect plasma TMAO levels. We also assessed postprandial glucose and insulin responses and plasma  changes to diets high and low in RS. In a cross-over trial, fifty-two men and women consumed a 2-week baseline diet (41 percentage of energy (%E) CHO, 40 % , 19 % protein), followed by 2-week high- and low-RS diets separated by 2-week washouts. RS diets were assigned at random within the context of higher (51-53 %E) v. lower CHO (39-40 %E) intake. Measurements were obtained in the fasting state and, for glucose and insulin, during a meal test matching the composition of the assigned diet. With lower CHO intake, plasma TMAO, carnitine, betaine and γ-butyrobetaine concentrations were higher after the high- v. low-RS diet (P<0·01 each). These metabolites were not differentially affected by high v. low RS when CHO intake was high. Although the high-RS meal reduced postprandial insulin and glucose responses when CHO intake was low (P<0·01 each), RS did not affect fasting lipids, lipoproteins, glucose or insulin irrespective of dietary CHO content. In conclusion, a lower-CHO diet high in RS was associated with higher plasma TMAO levels. These findings, together with the absence of change in fasting lipids, suggest that short-term high-RS diets do not improve markers of cardiometabolic health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26371012>A Phospholipid-Protein Complex from Antarctic Krill Reduced Plasma Homocysteine Levels and Increased Plasma Trimethylamine-N-Oxide (TMAO) and Carnitine Levels in Male Wistar Rats.</a></h2><p>Seafood is assumed to be beneficial for cardiovascular health, mainly based on plasma  lowering and anti-inflammatory effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, other plasma risk factors linked to cardiovascular disease are less studied. This study aimed to penetrate the effect of a phospholipid-protein complex (PPC) from Antarctic krill on one-carbon  and production of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in rats. Male Wistar rats were fed isoenergetic control, 6%, or 11% PPC diets for four weeks. Rats fed PPC had reduced total homocysteine plasma level and increased levels of choline, dimethylglycine and cysteine, whereas the plasma level of methionine was unchanged compared to control. PPC feeding increased the plasma level of TMAO, carnitine, its precursors trimethyllysine and γ-butyrobetaine. There was a close correlation between plasma TMAO and carnitine, trimethyllysine, and γ-butyrobetaine, but not between TMAO and choline. The present data suggest that PPC has a homocysteine lowering effect and is associated with altered plasma concentrations of metabolites related to one-carbon  and B-vitamin status in rats. Moreover, the present study reveals a non-obligatory role of gut microbiota in the increased plasma TMAO level as it can be explained by the PPC's content of TMAO. The increased level of carnitine and carnitine precursors is interpreted to reflect increased carnitine biosynthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29925775>Inulin Supplementation Does Not Reduce Plasma Trimethylamine -Oxide Concentrations in Individuals at Risk for Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Trimethylamine -oxide (TMAO) is associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Prebiotic supplementation has been purported to reduce TMAO production, but whether prebiotics reduce fasting or postprandial TMAO levels is unclear. Sedentary, overweight/obese adults at risk for T2DM ( = 18) were randomized to consume a standardized diet (55% carbohydrate, 30% ) with 10 g/day of either an inulin supplement or maltodextrin placebo for 6 weeks. Blood samples were obtained in the fasting state and hourly during a 4-h high- challenge meal (820 kcal; 25% carbohydrate, 63% ; 317.4 mg choline, 62.5 mg betaine, 8.1 mg l-carnitine) before and after the diet. Plasma TMAO and trimethylamine (TMA) moieties (choline, l-carnitine, betaine, and &gamma;-butyrobetaine) were measured using isocratic ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). There were no differences in fasting or postprandial TMAO or TMA moieties between the inulin and placebo groups at baseline (all  > 0.05). There were no significant changes in fasting or postprandial plasma TMAO or TMA moiety concentrations following inulin or placebo. These findings suggest that inulin supplementation for 6 weeks did not reduce fasting or postprandial TMAO in individuals at risk for T2DM. Future studies are needed to identify efficacious interventions that reduce plasma TMAO concentrations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28197778>Evaluating effects of L-carnitine on human bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.</a></h2><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells showing potential for use in regenerative medicine. Culture techniques that are more stable and methods for the more efficient production of MSCs with therapeutic efficacy are needed. We evaluate the effects of growing bone marrow (Bm)-derived MSCs in the presence of L-carnitine, which is believed to promote  and to suppress apoptosis. The presence of L-carnitine decreased the degree of drug-induced apoptosis and suppressed adipogenic differentiation. Metabolomic analysis by means of the exhaustive investigation of metabolic products showed that, in addition to increased β-oxidation and the expression of all carnitine derivatives other than  (an intermediate in carnitine synthesis), polysaturated and polyunsaturated acids were down-regulated. An integrated analysis incorporating both serial analysis of gene expression and metabolomics revealed increases in cell survival, suggesting the utility of carnitine. The addition of carnitine elevated the oxygen consumption rate by BmMSCs that had been cultured for only a few generations and those that had become senescent following repeated replication indicating that mitochondrial activation occurred. Our exhaustive analysis of the effects of various carnitine metabolites thus suggests that the addition of L-carnitine to BmMSCs during expansion enables efficient cell production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30830480>Metabolomic analyses reveal  abnormalities and hepatic dysfunction in non-human primate model for Yersinia pestis.</a></h2><p>Pneumonic plague is caused by the aerosolized form of Yersinia pestis and is a highly virulent infection with complex clinical consequences, and without treatment, the fatality rate approaches 100%. The exact mechanisms of disease progression are unclear, with limited work done using metabolite profiling to study disease progression.The aim of this pilot study was to profile the plasma metabolomics in an animal model of Y. pestis infection.In this study, African Green monkeys were challenged with the highly virulent, aerosolized Y. pestis strain CO92, and untargeted metabolomics profiling of plasma was performed using liquid and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry.At early time points post-exposure, we found significant increases in polyunsaturated, long chain fatty acid metabolites with p values ranging from as low as 0.000001 (ratio = 1.94) for the metabolite eicosapentaenoate to 0.04 (ratio = 1.36) for the metabolite adrenate when compared to time-matched controls. Multiple acyl carnitines metabolites were increased at earlier time points and could be a result of fatty acid oxidation defects with p values ranging from as low as 0.00001 (ratio = 2.95) for the metabolite octanoylcarnitine to 0.04 (ratio = 1.33) for metabolite  when compared to time-matched controls. Dicarboxylic acids are important metabolic products of fatty acids oxidation, and when compared to time matched controls, were higher at earlier time points where metabolite tetradecanedioate has a ratio of 4.09 with significant p value of 0.000002 and adipate with a ratio of 1.12 and p value of 0.004. The metabolites from lysolipids (with significant p values ranging from 0.00006 for 1-oleoylglycerophosphoethanolamine to 0.04 for 1-stearoylglycerophosphoethanolamine and a ratio of 0.47 and 0.78, respectively) and bile acid  (with significant p values ranging from 0.02 for cholate to 0.04 for deoxycholate and a ratio of 0.39 and 0.66, respectively) pathways were significantly lower compared to their time-matched controls during the entire course of infection. Metabolite levels from amino acid pathways were disrupted, and a few from the leucine, isoleucine and valine pathway were significantly higher (p values ranging from 0.002 to 0.04 and ratios ranging from 1.3 to 1.5, respectively), whereas metabolites from the urea cycle, arginine and proline pathways were significantly lower (p values ranging from 0.00008 to 0.02 and ratios ranging from 0.5 to 0.7, respectively) during the course of infection.The involvement of several  pathways post-infection suggested activation of pathways linked to inflammation and oxidative stress. Metabolite data further showed increased energy demand, and multiple metabolites indicated potential hepatic dysfunction. Integration of blood metabolomics and transcriptomics data identified linoleate as a core metabolite with cross-talk with multiple genes from various time points. Collectively, the data from this study provided new insights into the mechanisms of Y. pestis pathogenesis that may aid in development of therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25989106>Methyl-γ-butyrobetaine decreases levels of acylcarnitines and attenuates the development of atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>The elevation of the levels of l-carnitine and its fatty acid esters, acylcarnitines, in tissue or plasma has been linked to the development of atherosclerosis. Recently, a potent inhibitor of l-carnitine biosynthesis and transport, methyl-γ-butyrobetaine (methyl-GBB), was discovered. In this study, we evaluated the effects of γ-butyrobetaine (GBB), l-carnitine and methyl-GBB administration on the progression of atherosclerosis.Apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE(-/-)) mice were treated with methyl-GBB, l-carnitine or GBB for 4months. Following the treatment, the amount of atherosclerotic lesions, the number of immune cells in atherosclerotic lesions and the plasma  profile were analysed. The l-carnitine and acylcarnitine levels were determined in the aortic tissues of CD-1 outbred mice 2weeks after treatment with methyl-GBB at the dose of 10mg/kg.Treatment with methyl-GBB decreased the acylcarnitine and l-carnitine levels in the aortic tissues by seventeen- and ten-fold, respectively. Methyl-GBB treatment at a dose of 10mg/kg reduced the size of atherosclerotic plaques by 36%. Neither l-carnitine nor GBB treatment affected the development of atherosclerosis.Methyl-GBB administration significantly attenuated the development of atherosclerosis in apoE(-/-)mice. Our results demonstrate that decreasing the acylcarnitine pools can attenuate the development of atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We performed randomized-controlled dietary intervention studies to explore the impact of chronic dietary patterns on TMAO levels,  and renal excretion.Volunteers (N = 113) were enrolled in a randomized 2-arm (high- or low-saturated ) crossover design study. Within each arm, three 4-week isocaloric diets (with washout period between each) were evaluated (all meals prepared in metabolic kitchen with 25% calories from protein) to examine the effects of red meat, white meat, or non-meat protein on TMAO . Trimethylamine N-oxide and other trimethylamine (TMA) related metabolites were quantified at the end of each diet period. A random subset (N = 13) of subjects also participated in heavy isotope tracer studies. Chronic red meat, but not white meat or non-meat ingestion, increased plasma and urine TMAO (each >two-fold; P < 0.0001). Red meat ingestion also significantly reduced fractional renal excretion of TMAO (P < 0.05), but conversely, increased fractional renal excretion of carnitine, and two alternative gut microbiota-generated metabolites of carnitine, γ-butyrobetaine, and crotonobetaine (P < 0.05). Oral isotope challenge revealed red meat or white meat (vs. non-meat) increased TMA and TMAO production from carnitine (P < 0.05 each) but not choline. Dietary-saturated  failed to impact TMAO or its metabolites.Chronic dietary red meat increases systemic TMAO levels through: (i) enhanced dietary precursors; (ii) increased microbial TMA/TMAO production from carnitine, but not choline; and (iii) reduced renal TMAO excretion. Discontinuation of dietary red meat reduces plasma TMAO within 4 weeks.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author(s) 2018.

Many follow a low-phenylalanine (low-Phe) diet devoid of animal protein in combination with medical foods (MFs).To assess  in participants with PKU consuming amino acid MFs (AA-MFs) or glycomacropeptide MFs (GMP-MFs), we conducted fatty acid and metabolomics analyses.We used subsets of fasting plasma and urine samples from our randomized crossover trial in which participants with early-treated classical and variant (milder) PKU consumed a low-Phe diet combined with AA-MFs or GMP-MFs for 3 wk each. Fatty acid profiles of red blood cell (RBC) membranes were determined for 25 adults (aged 18-49 y) with PKU and 143 control participants. Metabolomics analyses of plasma and urine samples were conducted by Metabolon for 9-10 adolescent and adult participants with PKU and for 15 control participants.RBC fatty acid profiles were not significantly different with AA-MFs or GMP-MFs. PKU participants showed higher total n-6:n-3 (ω-6:ω-3) fatty acids (mean ± SD percentages of total fatty acids: AA-MF = 5.45% ± 1.07%; controls = 4.33%; P < 0.001) and lower docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; AA-MF = 3.21% ± 0.98%; controls = 3.70% ± 1.01%; P = 0.02) and eicosapentaenoic acid (AA-MF = 0.33% ± 0.12%; controls = 0.60% ± 0.43%; P < 0.001) in RBCs than did control participants. Despite higher carnitine intake from AA-MFs than GMP-MFs (mean ± SE intake: AA-MFs = 58.6 ± 5.3 mg/d; GMP-MFs = 0.3 ± 0.01 mg/d; P < 0.001), plasma concentrations of carnitine were similar and not different from those in the control group (AA-MF compared with GMP-MF, P = 0.73). AA-MFs resulted in higher urinary excretion of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which is synthesized by bacteria from carnitine, compared with GMP-MFs (mean ± SE scaled intensity-TMAO: AA-MFs = 1.2 ± 0.1, GMP-MFs = 0.9 ± 0.1; P = 0.005). Plasma  was lower in PKU participants than in control participants, suggesting reduced carnitine biosynthesis in PKU (AA-MF = 0.9 ± 0.1; GMP-MF = 1.0 ± 0.1; controls = 1.3 ± 0.1; AA-MF compared with controls, P = 0.01; GMP-MF compared with controls, P = 0.04).Supplementation with DHA is needed in PKU. Carnitine supplementation of AA-MFs shows reduced bioavailability due, in part, to bacterial degradation to TMAO, whereas the bioavailability of carnitine is greater with prebiotic GMP-MFs.

Krill oil (RIMFROST Sublime®) is a phospholipid-rich oil with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA): docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ratio of 1.8:1. In this pilot study we determined if krill oil could favourable affect plasma  parameters and parameters involved in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis.The study was conducted as a 28 days intervention study examining effect-parameters of dietary supplementation with krill oil (832.5 mg EPA and DHA per day). 17 healthy volunteers in the age group 18-36 (mean age 23 ± 4 years) participated. Plasma lipids, lipoprotein particle sizes, fatty acid composition in plasma and red blood cells (RBCs), plasma cytokines, antioxidant capacity, acylcarntines, carnitine, choline, betaine, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) were measured before and after supplementation.Plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) and large very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) & chylomicron particle concentrations decreased after 28 days of krill oil intake. A significant reduction in the TAG/HDL cholesterol resulted. Krill oil supplementation decreased n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio both in plasma and RBCs. This was due to increased EPA, DHA and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and reduced amount of arachidonic acid (AA). The increase of n-3 fatty acids and wt % of EPA and DHA in RBC was of smaller magnitude than found in plasma. Krill oil intake increased the antioxidant capacity, double bond index (DBI) and the fatty acid anti-inflammatory index. The plasma atherogenicity index remained constant whereas the thrombogenicity index decreased. Plasma choline, betaine and the carnitine precursor, γ-butyrobetaine were increased after krill oil supplementation whereas the TMAO and carnitine concentrations remained unchanged.Krill oil consumption is considered health beneficial as it decreases cardiovascular disease risk parameters through effects on plasma TAGs, lipoprotein particles, fatty acid profile, redox status and possible inflammation. Noteworthy, no adverse effects on plasma levels of TMAO and carnitine were found.</p></html>
