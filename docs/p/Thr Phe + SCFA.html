In particular, we report model complexes of the general formula fac-[M(L)(CO)] (M = Re, Tc, Re) where L denotes NOTA-Pyr (1) or NODAGA-Pyr (2), which are derived from conjugation of NOTA/NODAGA with pyrrolidine (Pyr). Further, as proof-of-principle, we synthesized the peptide bioconjugate NODAGA-sst-ANT (3) and explored its complexation with the fac-[Re(CO)] and fac-[Tc][Tc(CO)] cores; sst-ANT denotes the somatostatin receptor (SSTR) antagonist 4-NO--c(DCys-Tyr-DTrp-Lys--Cys)-DTyr-NH. Rhenium complexes Re-1 through Re-3 were synthesized and characterized spectroscopically, and receptor binding affinity was demonstrated for Re-3 in SSTR-expressing cells (AR42J, IC = 91 nM). Radiolabeled complexes [Tc]Tc/[Re]Re-1/2 and [Tc]Tc-3 were prepared in high radiochemical yield (>90%, determined by radio-HPLC) by reacting [Tc]/[Re][Tc/Re(OH)(CO)] with 1-3 and correlated well with the respective Re-1 through Re-3 standards in comparative HPLC studies. All radiotracers remained intact through 24 h (Tc-labeled complexes) or 48 h (Re-labeled complexes) against 1 mM l-histidine and 1 mM l-cysteine (pH 7.4, 37 °C). Similarly, rat serum stability studies displayed no decomposition and low nonspecific binding of 9-24% through 4 h. Biodistribution of [Tc]Tc-3 in healthy CF-1 mice demonstrated a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Rapid clearance was observed within 1 h post-injection, predominantly via the renal system (82% of the injected dose was excreted in urine by 1 h), with low kidney retention (% ID/g: 11 at 1 h, 5 at 4 h, and 1 at 24 h) and low nonspecific uptake in other organs/tissues. Our findings establish NOTA and NODAGA as outstanding BFCs for the fac-[M(CO)] core in the design and development of organometallic radiopharmaceuticals. Future in vivo studies of [Tc]Tc- and [Re]Re-tricarbonyl complexes of NODAGA/NOTA-biomolecule conjugates will further probe the potential of these chelates for nuclear medicine applications in diagnostic imaging and targeted radiotherapy, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27704838>Analysis of Differential Efficacy and Affinity of GABA (α1/α2) Selective Modulators.</a></h2><p>Selective modulators of the γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) family of receptors have the potential to treat a range of disease states related to cognition, pain, and anxiety. While the development of various α subunit-selective modulators is currently underway for the treatment of anxiety disorders, a mechanistic understanding of the correlation between their bioactivity and efficacy, based on ligand-target interactions, is currently still lacking. In order to alleviate this situation, in the current study we have analyzed, using ligand- and structure-based methods, a data set of 5440 GABA modulators. The Spearman correlation (ρ) between binding activity and efficacy of compounds was calculated to be 0.008 and 0.31 against the α1 and α2 subunits of GABA receptor, respectively; in other words, the compounds had little diversity in structure and bioactivity, but they differed significantly in efficacy. Two compounds were selected as a case study for detailed interaction analysis due to the small difference in their structures and affinities (ΔpK = 0.45 log units, ΔpK = 0 log units) as compared to larger relative efficacies (ΔRE = 1.03, ΔRE = 0.21). Docking analysis suggested that His-101 is involved in a characteristic interaction of the α1 receptor with both compounds 1 and 2. Residues such as -77, -142, Asn-60, and Arg-144 of the γ chain of the α1γ2 complex also showed interactions with heterocyclic rings of both compounds 1 and 2, but these interactions were disturbed in the case of α2γ2 complex docking results. Binding pocket stability analysis based on molecular dynamics identified three substitutions in the loop C region of the α2 subunit, namely, G200E, I201T, and V202I, causing a reduction in the flexibility of α2 compared to α1. These amino  in α2, as compared to α1, were also observed to decrease the vibrational and dihedral entropy and to increase the hydrogen bond content in α2 in the apo state. However, freezing of both α1 and α2 was observed in the ligand-bound state, with an increased number of internal hydrogen bonds and increased entropy. Therefore, we hypothesize that the amino acid differences in the loop C region of α2 are responsible for conformational changes in the protein structure compared to α1, as well as for the binding modes of compounds and hence their functional signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26851853>Milk protein yield and mammary metabolism are affected by phenylalanine deficiency but not by threonine or tryptophan deficiency.</a></h2><p>Efficient milk protein synthesis requires that the essential AA be presented to the mammary gland in the right amount and proportion to maximize protein synthesis and minimize losses. This study investigated the effects of individual AA deficiencies on cow productivity, mammary metabolism, and glucose whole-body rate of appearance. Five Holstein cows were used in a 5 × 5 Latin square design trial with 10-d periods. Treatments were abomasal infusions of (1) water (CTL); (2) complete AA mixture (TAA); (3) TAA without  (No-); (4) TAA without  (No-); and (5) TAA without Trp (No-Trp). Each treatment was compared with TAA. Treatment did not affect milk, fat, or lactose yields. Arterial concentrations of , , and Trp decreased with their respective deletions by 60, 76, and 69%. In response to the decreased arterial supply of the deleted AA, mammary plasma flow significantly increased by 55% with No- but did not increase with No- or No-Trp. Mammary uptake of  was reduced by No-, accompanied by a reduced milk protein yield; uptakes of  and Trp were not affected by their respective deletions, and milk protein yield did not decrease with these treatments. Deletion of  tended to reduce its mammary uptake relative to milk output (U:O), accompanied by an increased U:O of Tyr, but deletion of  and Trp did not affect the U:O of the corresponding AA. Plasma urea-N concentration was lower with CTL and tended to be higher with No-. Arterial concentrations and mammary uptake of acetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, and lactate were unaffected by treatment. Treatment had no effect on glucose rate of appearance at the whole-body level. Lactose output as a percentage of glucose whole-body rate of appearance was not affected by treatment. Overall, the study indicated that a deficiency of  negatively affected productivity and mammary metabolism but that a deficiency of  or Trp did not.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

The aim of this study was to perform a side-by-side comparison of the in vitro and in vivo performance of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (NODAGA = 1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric acid,4,7-acetic acid, JR11 = p-Cl--cyclo(D-Cys-Aph(Hor)-D-Aph(cbm)-Lys--Cys)D-Tyr-NH2), a somatostatin receptor 2 antagonist, with the clinically used sst2 agonist 64Cu-DOTA-TATE ((TATE = D--cyclo(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys--Cys)). In vitro studies demonstrated Kd values of 5.7±0.95 nM (Bmax = 4.1±0.18 nM) for the antagonist 64/natCu-NODAGA-JR11 and 20.1±4.4. nM (Bmax = 0.48±0.18 nM) for the agonist 64/natCu-DOTA-TATE. Cell uptake studies showed the expected differences between agonists and antagonists. Whereas 64Cu-DOTA-TATE (the agonist) showed very effective internalization in the cell culture assay (with 50% internalized at 4 hours post-peptide addition under the given experimental conditions), 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (the antagonist) showed little internalization but strong receptor-mediated uptake at the cell membrane. Biodistribution studies of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 showed rapid blood clearance and tumor uptake with increasing tumor-to-relevant organ ratios within the first 4 hours and in some cases, 24 hours, respectively. The tumor washout was slow or non-existent in the first 4 hours, whereas the kidney washout was very efficient, leading to high and increasing tumor-to-kidney ratios over time. Specificity of tumor uptake was proven by co-injection of high excess of non-radiolabeled peptide, which led to >80% tumor blocking. 64Cu-DOTA-TATE showed less favorable pharmacokinetics, with the exception of lower kidney uptake. Blood clearance was distinctly slower and persistent higher blood values were found at 24 hours. Uptake in the liver and lung was relatively high and also persistent. The tumor uptake was specific and similar to that of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 at 1 h, but release from the tumor was very fast, particularly between 4 and 24 hours. Tumor-to-normal organ ratios were distinctly lower after 1 hour. This is indicative of insufficient in vivo stability. PET studies of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 reflected the biodistribution data with nicely delineated tumor and low background. 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 shows promising pharmacokinetic properties for further translation into the clinic.</p></html>
