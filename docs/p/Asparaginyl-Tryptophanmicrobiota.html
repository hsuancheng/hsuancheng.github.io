We quantified sputum inflammatory cells and inflammatory markers (IL-27, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, LTB, MPO) by ELISA, total bacterial load (16S) and pathogenic bacteria by qRT-PCR.AATD-AT patients were younger but had similar spirometric and DLCO values compared to cigarette smoke-associated COPD, despite a lower burden of smoking history. Compared to cigarette smoke-associated COPD, AATD-noT and AATD-AT patients had lower sputum neutrophil levels (=0.0446, =0.0135), total bacterial load (16S) (=0.0081, =0.0223),  (=0.0115, =0.0127) and  (=0.0013, =0.0001). Sputum IL-27 was significantly elevated in CS and cigarette smoke-associated COPD. AATD-AT, but not AATD-noT patients, had IL-27 sputum levels (pg/ml) significantly lower than COPD (=0.0297) and these positively correlated with FEV% predicted values (=0.578, =0.0307).Compared to cigarette smoke-associated COPD, AATD-AT (COPD) patients have a distinct airway inflammatory and microbiological profile. The decreased sputum bacterial load and IL-27 levels in AATD-AT patients suggests that augmentation therapy play a role in these changes.© 2019 Balbi et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681174>Effect of Metformin on Short-Term High-Fat Diet-Induced Weight Gain and Anxiety-Like Behavior and the Gut .</a></h1><p>The pathogenic factors of the complex epidemic disorder-obesity, have expanded from genetic background, endocrine factors, abnormal feeding behaviors, and direct neural control of adipose tissue physiology. As a chronic metabolic disease, it is important to find new potential therapeutic targets and locate a sensitive time window for intervention. In this study, we focus on the early stage of a high-fat diet mouse model: a short-term 3-week treatment. Our results showed that this short-term 3-week HFD can already induce significant body weight gain, increased adipocyte size and surprisingly, anxiety-like behavior of the animals. Then we tried the early intervention with metformin, already reported for its effects in long-term HFD induced obesity. For a short-term 3-week co-treatment, metformin alleviated the HFD-induced increase in body weight, the increase in adipocyte size and furthermore, the anxiety-like behavior. Differences were noted among the normal diet (ND), HFD, and HFD with metformin co-treatment groups in gut , including its composition and diversity. The possible involvement of gut  cannot be ruled out. Intense phospho-AMPK staining was found in the metformin treatment group in the habenular nuclei, hippocampus and basal ganglia of the brain compared with the HFD group, implying that the anxiolytic effect of metformin could be due to the direct activation of the AMPK pathway in the anxiety-related brain nuclei.Copyright © 2019 Ji, Wang and Li.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671720>The Human Milk  is Modulated by Maternal Diet.</a></h1><p>Human milk microorganisms contribute not only to the healthy development of the immune system in infants, but also in shaping the gut .

A total of 342, 26-d-old Cobb500 broilers were divided into 5 groups with 6 replicates. Treatments were as follows: (a) Low stocking density (L, 9 birds per cage); (b) High stocking density (H, 12 birds per cage); (c) H + 50 ppm NAM; (d) H + 500 ppm BA; (e) H + 50 ppm NAM + 500 ppm BA (COMB). The results showed that high stocking density significantly reduced the feed intake and body weight gain of broilers, while COMB improved the growth performance at high stocking density. High stocking density significantly reduced the liver metallothionein content, liver mitochondrial membrane potential and the activities of Na+K+-ATPase and Ca2+Mg2+-ATPase. In contrast, the liver metallothionein contents in the NAM, BA and COMB fed group were higher than those in the H group. COMB increased the activity of ATPase as well, but it failed to enhance the mitochondrial membrane potential. Stocking density also affected gut  of broilers. The high-density group increased the relative abundance of Blautia. Supplementation of BA and NAM increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, respectively. In conclusion, a combination of NAM and BA can improve the performance, antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial function and intestinal  of broilers at high stocking density.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692530>Pediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: current perspectives on diagnosis and management.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents the most common cause of chronic liver disease in childhood. To date, the "multiple-hit" hypothesis is largely recognized as an explanation of NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. Obesity and features of the metabolic syndrome have been closely linked to NAFLD development. Due to the increased prevalence of obesity worldwide, NAFLD has reached epidemic proportions over time. Given its unfavorable cardiometabolic burden (such as cardiovascular and metabolic consequences), it represents a worrying phenomenon needing a more comprehensive and successful management. Laboratory tests and classical imaging techniques play a pivotal role in NAFLD diagnosis, but novel noninvasive alternative methods to diagnose and monitor NAFLD have been investigated. Currently, lifestyle modifications remain the mainstay treatment, although its efficacy is poor because of the lack of compliance. Pediatric research is focusing on multiple alternative treatments targeting the main pathogenic factors such as insulin-resistance, dyslipidemia, gut-liver axis and , oxidative stress, and proinflammatory pathways. Results from these studies are promising but larger validation is needed. Innovative therapeutic approaches might add an important piece in the complex knowledge of pediatric NAFLD. We aimed to summarize recent insights into NAFLD diagnosis and treatment in children, with a focus on possible future perspectives in pediatric research.© 2019 Di Sessa et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684193>Cooperative and Escaping Mechanisms between Circulating Tumor Cells and Blood Constituents.</a></h1><p>Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths and despite measurable progress in the field, underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) disseminate within the bloodstream, where most of them die due to the attack of the immune system. On the other hand, recent evidence shows active interactions between CTCs and platelets, myeloid cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and other hematopoietic cells that secrete immunosuppressive cytokines, which aid CTCs to evade the immune system and enable metastasis. Platelets, for instance, regulate inflammation, recruit neutrophils, and cause fibrin clots, which may protect CTCs from the attack of Natural Killer cells or macrophages and facilitate extravasation. Recently, a correlation between the commensal  and the inflammatory/immune tone of the organism has been stablished. Thus, the  may affect the development of cancer-promoting conditions. Furthermore, CTCs may suffer phenotypic changes, as those caused by the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, that also contribute to the immune escape and resistance to immunotherapy.

Although the microbiome seems to be linked to all sorts of diseases, cancer has the biggest potential to be investigated. Following the publication of the National Institute of Health - Human Microbiome Project (NIH-HMP), the link between Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) and microbiome seems to be a fast-moving field in research area. However, robust evidence-based literature is still quite scarce. Nevertheless the relationship between oral microbiome and HNC could have important consequences for prevention and early detection of this type of tumors. The aims of the present review are: (i) to discuss current pre-clinical evidence of a role of oral microbiome in HNC; (ii) to report recent developments in understanding the human microbiome's relationship with HNC oncogenesis; (iii) to explore the issue of treatment response and treatment toxicity; (iv) to describe the role of  as potentially modifiable factor suitable for targeting by therapeutics. Further studies are needed to better establish the causal relationship between oral microbiome and HNC oncogenesis. Future trials should continue to explore oral microbiome in order to build the scientific and clinical rationale of HNC preventative and ameliorate treatment outcome.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to study the different effects of FO versus soybean oil (SO) on growth, intestinal health and immune function of neonates with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) using a weaned piglet model. Forty pairs of male IUGR and normal birth weight piglets, weaned at 21 ± 1 d, were fed diets containing either 4% FO or SO for 3 weeks consecutively. Growth performance, nutrient digestibility and intestinal function parameters, immunology and  composition were determined. IUGR led to a poor growth rate, nutrient digestibility and abnormal immunology variables, whereas feeding FO diet improved systemic and gut immunity, as indicated by increased plasma concentration of immunoglobulin G and decreased CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes, and down-regulated intestinal expression of genes (MyD88, NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-10). Although IUGR tended to decrease villous height, feeding FO diet tended to increase the villi-crypt ratio and up-regulated expressions of tight junction genes (Claudin-1 and ZO-1), together with increased mucosa contents of n-3 PUFAs and a lower Σn-6/Σn-3 ratio. Besides, FO diet decreased the abundance of pathogenic bacteria Spirochaetes, and increased phylum Actinobacteria, and genera Blautia and Bifidobacterium in colonic digesta. Our findings indicate that IUGR impairs growth rate, nutrient digestibility, and partly immunology variables, whereas feeding FO-supplemented diet could improve intestinal function and immunity of both IUGR and NBW pigs, associated with the altered gut microbiome and mucosal fatty acid profile.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670167>Reduction in pathogenic load of wheat by tempering with saline organic acid solutions at different seasonal temperatures.</a></h1><p>As a raw agricultural commodity, wheat is exposed to microbial contamination; therefore, enteric pathogens may be among its  creating a food safety risk in milled products. This research evaluates (1) the effectiveness of organic acids dissolved in saline solutions to reduce the counts of pathogenic microorganisms in soft and hard wheat, and also investigates the effect of seasonal temperature on (2) survivability of pathogens in wheat kernels and on (3) pathogen inactivation during tempering with saline organic acid solutions. Wheat samples were inoculated with cocktails of either 5 serovars of Salmonella enterica, 5 E. coli O157:H7 or 6 non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strains to achieve a concentration of ~7 log CFU/g. Inoculated samples were allowed to stand for 7-days at temperatures (2.0, 10.8, 24.2, 32 °C) corresponding to those experienced during winter, spring/fall, and summer (average and maximum) in the main wheat growing regions in the state of Nebraska, USA. Besides water, solutions containing acid (acetic or lactic 2.5% or 5.0% v/v) and NaCl (~26% w/v) were used for tempering the wheat to 15.0% (soft) and 15.5% (hard) moisture at the different seasonal temperatures. The survival of pathogenic microorganisms throughout the resting period, and before and after tempering was analyzed by plating samples on injury-recovery media. The survival rate of pathogenic microorganisms on wheat kernels was higher at temperatures experienced during the winter (2.0 °C) and spring/fall (10.8 °C) months. Regardless of tempering temperature, the initial pathogen load was reduced significantly by all solutions when compared to the control tempered with water (P ≤ .05). The combination of lactic acid (5.0%) and NaCl was the most effective treatment against Salmonella enterica, E. coli O157:H7 and non-O157 STEC, with average reduction values of 1.8, 1.8 and 1.6 log CFU/g for soft wheat and 2.6, 2.4 and 2.4 log CFU/g for hard wheat, respectively. Implementation of organic acids and NaCl in tempering water may have the potential to reduce the risk of pathogen contamination in milled products.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

With the growing interest of the use of mastic oil in the food and pharmaceutical industry, systematic in vivo studies are needed to address controlled usage and safety issues. In the present work we evaluated the safety of mastic oil using as a model the zebrafish lateral line system. In addition, we studied the gene expression profile of zebrafish fed with mastic oil-supplemented diet using microarray analysis. Our results showed that the hair cells of lateral line neuromasts are functional upon exposure of zebrafish larvae up to 20 ppm of mastic essential oil, while treatment with higher concentrations, 100 and 200 ppm, resulted in increased larvae mortality. Dietary supplementation of zebrafish with mastic essential oil led to differential expression of interferon response-related genes as well as the immune responsive gene 1 () that links cellular metabolism with immune defense. Notably, , a constituent of the mucus hydrogel that protects the host against invading pathogens, was up-regulated.

Thirty healthy subjects, ages 18 to 45, were randomized into three cohorts of 10 subjects each, receiving either 200, 400 or 600 mg of CRS3123 (eight subjects per cohort) or placebo (two subjects per cohort) by oral administration twice daily for 10 days. CRS3123 was generally safe and well tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAEs), or severe treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported. All subjects completed their assigned treatment and follow-up visits, and there were no trends in systemic, vital signs or laboratory TEAEs. There were no QTcF interval changes or any clinically significant changes in other ECG intervals or morphology. CRS3123 showed limited but detectable systemic uptake; although absorption increased with increasing dose, the increase was less than dose proportional. Importantly, the bulk of the oral dose was not absorbed, and fecal concentrations were substantially above the MIC value of 1 μg/ml at all dosages tested. Subjects receiving either of the two lower doses of CRS3123 exhibited minimal disruption of normal gut  after ten days of twice-daily dosing.

Preventing infections is becoming increasingly important, as frontline antibiotics become less effective and frequently induce recurrence by disrupting intestinal . The clinically most advanced vaccine approaches prevent symptoms once C. difficile infection is established by inducing immunity to secreted clostridial cytotoxins. However, they do not inhibit bacterial colonization and thereby favor asymptomatic carriage. Synthetic oligosaccharides resembling the C. difficile surface glycans PS-I, PS-II, and PS-III are immunogenic and serve as basis for colonization-preventing vaccines. Here, we demonstrate that glycoconjugate vaccine candidates based on synthetic oligosaccharides protected mice from infections with two different C. difficile strains. Four synthetic antigens, ranging in size from di- to hexasaccharides, were conjugated to CRM197, a carrier protein used in commercial vaccines. The vaccine candidates induced glycan-specific antibodies in mice and substantially limited C. difficile colonization and colitis after experimental infection. The glycoconjugates ameliorated intestinal pathology more substantially than a toxin-targeting vaccine. Colonization of the gut by C. difficile was selectively inhibited while intestinal  remained preserved. Passive transfer experiments with anti-PS-I serum revealed that protection is mediated by specific anti-glycan antibodies, however, cell-mediated immunity likely also contributed to protection in vivo.

Different strategies including phytase supplementation and more recently lactic acid (LA) are used to enhance the P availability from cereals in pig diets; however, their impact on the gut  has been rarely related to fecal shedding of opportunistic pathogens. The present study investigated the effect of phytase supplementation and the treatment of dietary cereals with 2.5% LA on the fecal microbiome composition of metabolic active bacteria and expression of virulence factor genes of enterotoxigenic  and  in growing pigs. Phytase supplementation reduced the fecal abundance of the most abundant  family, whereas the LA-treatment of cereals had a stronger impact on the bacterial community, reducing amylolytic, pullulanolytic and hemicellulolytic ,  and  as well as the fecal bacterial species richness (Chao1) and diversity (Shannon index). Mainly the family  benefited from the decline in the aforementioned families, being enriched by both dietary treatments. Multigroup data integration using sparse partial least squares-discriminant analysis showed that among the most discriminative operational taxonomic units (OTU) especially two unclassified -OTUs, one -like OTU and one OTU within the  group were associated with calcium and P levels but were negatively linked with complex carbohydrates in feces.

Without modifying the total bacterial gene copies and virulence factor expression of , both dietary phytase supplementation and LA-treatment of cereals drastically altered the bacterial community composition in pig feces. Results thereby allowed for the characterization of bacterial nutrient dependencies, indicating a link between fecal P availability, complex carbohydrate composition and alterations in the predominant genera.Copyright © 2019 Klinsoda, Vötterl, Zebeli and Metzler-Zebeli.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683407>[The analysis of the relationship between the fungal  from soil and tongue coating of 18 patients with precancerous lesions of upper gastrointestinal].</a></h1><p>The fungal  from self-retained soil and tongue coating of 18 patients with precancerous lesions of upper gastrointestinal (PLUG) were sequenced.

To what extent environmental influences affect the differential distribution of these microbial populations may therefore significantly impact the successful farming of the host. Using a sea-based container culture (SBCC) system for the on-growing of European lobster (Homarus gammarus), we tracked the bacterial gut  over a 1-year period. We compared these communities with lobsters of the same cohort, retained in a land-based culture (LBC) system to assess the effects of the culture environment on gut bacterial assemblage and describe the phylogenetic structure of the  to compare deterministic and stochastic assembly across both environments. Bacterial gut communities from SBCCs were generally more phylogenetically clustered, and therefore deterministically assembled, compared to those reared in land-based systems. Lobsters in SBCCs displayed significantly more species-rich and species-diverse gut  compared to those retained in LBC. A reduction in the bacterial diversity of the gut was also associated with higher infection prevalence of the enteric viral pathogen Homarus gammarus nudivirus (HgNV). SBCCs may therefore benefit the overall health of the host by promoting the assembly of a more diverse gut bacterial community and reducing the susceptibility to disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686768>Prebiotic UG1601 mitigates constipation-related events in association with gut : A randomized placebo-controlled intervention study.</a></h1><p>Constipation is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder and its etiology is multifactorial. Growing evidence suggests that intestinal dysbiosis is associated with the development of constipation. Prebiotics are subjected to bacterial fermentation in the gut to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which can help relieve constipation symptoms. The prebiotic UG1601 consists of inulin, lactitol, and aloe vera gel, which are known laxatives, but randomized, controlled clinical trials that examine the effects of this supplement on gut  composition are lacking.To assess the efficacy of the prebiotic UG1601 in suppressing constipation-related adverse events in subjects with mild constipation.Adults with a stool frequency of less than thrice a week were randomized to receive either prebiotics or a placebo supplement for 4 wk. All participants provided their fecal and blood samples at baseline and at the end of intervention. Gastrointestinal symptoms and stool frequency were evaluated. The concentrations of serum endotoxemia markers and fecal SCFAs were determined. The relative abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria and the gut microbial community in the responders and non-responders in the prebiotics supplementation group were evaluated.There were no significant differences in gastrointestinal symptoms between groups, although the prebiotic group showed greater symptom improvement. However, after prebiotic usage, serum cluster of differentiation (CD) 14 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations were significantly decreased (CD14,  = 0.012; LPS,  < 0.001). The change in LPS concentration was significantly larger in the prebiotic group than in the placebo group ( < 0.001). Fecal SCFAs concentrations did not differ between groups, while the relative abundance of , a major butyrate producer, was significantly increased in the prebiotic group ( = 0.045). The abundances of the phylum Firmicutes and the family Lachnospiraceae (phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia) ( = 0.009) were decreased in the responders within the prebiotic group. In addition, the proportions of the phylum Firmicutes, the class Clostridia, and the order Clostridiales were inversely correlated with several fecal SCFAs ( < 0.05).Alterations in gut  composition, including a decrease in the phylum Firmicutes and an increase in butyrate-producing bacteria, following prebiotic UG1601 supplementation might help alleviate symptom scores and endotoxemia.©The Author(s) 2019.

Cost and health concerns associated with sucrose spurred the development and consumption of other sugars and sweeteners, with the average American consuming 10 times more sugar than 100 y ago. In this review, we discuss how gut microbes are affected by changes in the consumption of sugars and other sweeteners through transcriptional, abundance, and genetic adaptations. We propose that these adaptations result in microbes taking on different metabolic, ecological, and genetic profiles along the intestinal tract. We suggest novel approaches to assess the consequences of these changes on host-microbe interactions to determine the safety of novel sugars and sweeteners.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681013>Intestinal  Confer Protection by Priming the Immune System of Red Palm Weevil  Olivier (Coleoptera: Dryophthoridae).</a></h1><p>The immune system of animals, including insects, is the vital factor to maintain the symbiotic interactions between animals and their associated microbes. However, the effects of gut  on insect immunity remain mostly elusive. Red palm weevil (RPW),  Olivier, is a destructive pest of palm trees worldwide, which has forged alliances with its gut . Here, we found that the aposymbiotic insects succumbed at a significantly faster rate than conventionally reared (CR) ones upon bacterial infection. Physiological assays confirmed that CR insects had stronger antimicrobial activity and higher phenoloxidase activity in contrast to germfree (GF) ones, indicating that the systemic immune responses of GF individuals were compromised markedly. Interestingly, under the bacterial challenge conditions, the reassociation of gut  with GF insects could enhance their survival rate by rescuing their immunocompetence. Furthermore, comparative transcriptome analysis uncovered that 35 immune-related genes, including pathogen recognition receptors, effectors and immune signaling pathway, were significantly downregulated in GF insects as compared to CR ones. Collectively, our findings corrobate that intestinal commensal bacteria have profound immunostimulatory effects on RPW larvae. Therefore, knowledge on the effects of gut  on RPW immune defenses may contribute to of set up efficient control strategies of this pest.Copyright © 2019 Muhammad, Habineza, Ji, Hou and Shi.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686026>Home chemical and microbial transitions across urbanization.</a></h1><p>Urbanization represents a profound shift in human behaviour, and has considerable cultural and health-associated consequences.

The microbial composition of the human gut  is modulated by diet and other lifestyle habits and it has been reported that microbial diversity is altered in obese people. Obesity is a worldwide health problem that negatively impacts the quality of life. Currently, the widespread treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery. Interestingly, gut  has been shown to be a relevant factor in effective weight loss after bariatric surgery. Since that the human gut  of normal subjects differs between geographic regions, it is possible that rearrangements of the gut  in dysbiosis context are also region-specific. To better understand how gut  contribute to obesity, this study compared the composition of the human gut  of obese and lean people from six different regions and showed that the  compositions in the context of obesity were specific to each studied geographic location. Furthermore, we analyzed the functional patterns using shotgun DNA metagenomic sequencing and compared the results with other obesity-related metagenomic studies, we observed that microbial contribution to functional pathways were country-specific. Nevertheless, our study showed that although microbial composition of obese patients was country-specific, the overall metabolic functions appeared to be the same between countries, indicating that different  components contribute to similar metabolic outcomes to yield functional redundancy. Furthermore, we studied the  functional changes of obese patients after bariatric surgery, by shotgun metagenomics sequencing and observed that changes in functional pathways were specific to the type of obesity treatment. In all, our study provides new insights into the differences and similarities of obese gut  in relation to geographic location and obesity treatments.Copyright © 2019 Medina, Li, Thomson, Artacho, Pérez-Brocal and Moya.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697315>MDiNE: A model to estimate differential co-occurrence networks in microbiome studies.</a></h1><p>The human  is the collection of microorganisms colonizing the human body, and plays an integral part in human health. A growing trend in microbiome analysis is to construct a network to estimate the co-occurrence patterns among taxa through precision matrices. Existing methods do not facilitate investigation into how these networks change with respect to covariates.We propose a new model called Microbiome Differential Network Estimation (MDiNE) to estimate network changes with respect to a binary covariate. The counts of individual taxa in the samples are modelled through a multinomial distribution whose probabilities depend on a latent Gaussian random variable. A sparse precision matrix over all the latent terms determines the co-occurrence network among taxa. The model fit is obtained and evaluated using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods. The performance of our model is evaluated through an extensive simulation study, and is shown to outperform existing methods in terms of estimation of network parameters. We also demonstrate an application of the model to estimate changes in the intestinal microbial network topology with respect to Crohn's disease.MDiNE is implemented in a freely available R package: https://github.com/kevinmcgregor/mdine.A file containing supplemental material has been submitted with this manuscript.© The Author(s) 2019.

Its composition and function are shaped by host- and intra- interactions. Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that target bacteria and have the potential to modulate bacterial communities.To summarise phage biology and the clinical applications of phages in gastroenterology METHODS: PubMed was searched to identify relevant studies.Phages induce bacterial cell lysis, integration of viral DNA into the bacteria and/or coexistence in a stable equilibrium. Bacteria and phages have co-evolved and their dynamic interactions are yet to be fully understood. The increasing need to modulate microbial communities (e.g., gut , multidrug-resistant bacteria) has been a strong stimulus for research in phages as an antibacterial therapy. In gastroenterology, phage therapy has been mainly studied in infectious diseases such as cholera. However, it is currently being explored in several other circumstances such as treating Clostridioides difficile colitis, targeting adherent-invasive Escherichia coli in Crohn's disease or eradicating Fusobacterium nucleatum in colorectal cancer. Overall, phage therapy has a favourable and acceptable safety profile. Presently, trials with phage therapy are ongoing in Crohn's disease.Phage therapy is a promising therapeutic tool against pathogenic bacteria in the fields of infectious diseases and gastroenterology.

Perturbation of the healthy gut microbiome has been suggested to play a role in the development of inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Environmental and genetic factors can influence the composition of the microbiome; therefore, identification of microbial communities linked with a disease phenotype has become the first step towards defining the microbiome's role in health and disease. Use of 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing for profiling bacterial community has helped in advancing microbiome research. Despite its wide use, there is no uniform protocol for 16S rRNA-based taxonomic profiling analysis. Another limitation is the low resolution of taxonomic assignment due to technical difficulties such as smaller sequencing reads, as well as use of only forward (R1) reads in the final analysis due to low quality of reverse (R2) reads. There is need for a simplified method with high resolution to characterize bacterial diversity in a given biospecimen. Advancements in sequencing technology with the ability to sequence longer reads at high resolution have helped to overcome some of these challenges. Present sequencing technology combined with a publicly available metagenomic analysis pipeline such as R-based Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm-2 (DADA2) has helped advance microbial profiling at high resolution, as DADA2 can assign sequence at the genus and species levels. Described here is a guide for performing bacterial profiling using two-step amplification of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, followed by analysis using freely available analysis tools (i.e., DADA2, Phyloseq, and METAGENassist). It is believed that this simple and complete workflow will serve as an excellent tool for researchers interested in performing microbiome profiling studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687714>Ingestion of Bifidobacterium longum subspecies infantis strain CCFM687 regulated emotional behavior and the central BDNF pathway in chronic stress-induced depressive mice through reshaping the gut .</a></h1><p>Increasing evidence points to the effect of the gut  on central nervous system functions. Supplementation of certain microbial strains has been demonstrated to alleviate depressive behaviors and neurological abnormalities. This study took the approach to screen for an anti-depressive Bifidobacterium longum strain from fourteen candidates and systematically verified its effect in a chronic stress-induced depression mice model. B. longum subsp. infantis strain CCFM687 could significantly enhance the biosynthesis of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HTP) in vitro in RIN14B cells through up-regulation of the Tph1 gene expression. Administration of CCFM687 in mice significantly improved the scores in behavioral tests and increased the level of 5-HTP and serotonin (5-HT) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the brain. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the PFC was also increased, possibly through the 5-HT1A-CREB-BDNF pathway. In addition, CCFM687 alleviated the hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response and accordingly reversed the peripheral inflammation status. Moreover, the stress-induced structural and functional dysbiosis of the gut microbiome was improved by CCFM687, through increased alpha diversity and abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, in conjunction with inhibition of pathogenic gene expression. In summary, these results indicate that supplementation of B. longum subsp. infantis strain CCFM687 may prevent the onset of depression from chronic stress, and RIN14B could serve as an efficient cell model for rapid screening of anti-depressive probiotics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679421>Guidelines for Transparency on Gut Microbiome Studies in Essential and Experimental Hypertension.</a></h1><p>Hypertension is a complex and modifiable condition in which environmental factors contribute to both onset and progression.

We also provide best practice advice on sampling, storage of fecal/cecal samples, DNA extraction, sequencing methods (including metagenomics and 16S rRNA), and computational analyses.

Its presence within the animal and human intestinal  was correlated with immunomodulatory effects, mediated by both propionibacterial surface components and by secreted metabolites. It is widely implemented, both in the manufacture of fermented dairy products such as Swiss-type cheeses, and in the production of probiotic food complements, under the form of freeze-dried powders. The bottleneck of this drying process consists in the limited survival of bacteria during drying and storage. Protective pre-treatments have been applied to other bacteria and may, in a strain-dependent manner, confer enhanced resistance. However, very little information was yet published on  adaptation to freeze-drying. In this report, an immunomodulatory strain of this probiotic bacterium was cultured under hyperosmotic constraint in order to trigger osmoadaptation. This adaptation was then combined with acid or thermal pre-treatment. Such combination led to accumulation of key stress proteins, of intracellular compatible solute glycine betaine, to modulation of the propionibacterial membrane composition, and to enhanced survival upon freeze-drying.

In recent years, gut  has emerged as a new contributor to the metabolic syndrome establishment and associated cardiovascular diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that a positive modulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway, through phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibition could prevent cardiovascular alterations and gut dysbiosis that may be associated to metabolic syndrome. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were randomly divided into 4 groups: control, cafeteria diet (CD) and sildenafil citrate treated groups (5mg/kg per os) were given either a CD or a standard chow diet for 10 weeks. Body weight, arterial blood pressure and glucose tolerance test were monitored. At the 10th week, cardiac inotropy and coronary perfusion pressure were evaluated on isolated heart according to Langendorff method. Cumulative concentration response curves to phenylephrine and acetylcholine were determined on thoracic aorta rings for vascular reactivity evaluation. Faecal samples were collected for the gut  analysis. Compared to the control group, CD-fed rats showed a significant increase in body weight gain, arterial blood pressure and were glucose intolerant. This group showed also a decrease in β-adrenoceptor-induced cardiac inotropy and coronary vasodilation. Gut  analysis revealed a significant reduction in the abundance of Lactobocillus spp in cafeteria diet-fed rats when compared to the control ones. Sildenafil citrate long-term treatment decreased weight gain and arterial blood pressure, improved coronary vasodilation and reduced α1-adrenoceptor-induced vasoconstriction in CD group. However, it did not reverse gut dysbiosis induced by chronic CD feeding. These results suggest that cGMP pathway targeting may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the management of the metabolic syndrome and associated cardiovascular disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690068>Orally Administered CLA Ameliorates DSS-induced Colitis in Mice via Intestinal Barrier Improvement, Oxidative Stress Reduction, Inflammatory Cytokine and Gut  Modulation.</a></h1><p>Dietary supplementation with CLA has been reported to alleviate the effect of colitis in mice, but the mechanisms involved need further exploration. The study aimed to investigate how orally administered CLA alleviates DSS-induced colitis in mice. CLA was administered at five different doses: 40 mg/d, 20 mg/d, 10 mg/d, 5 mg/d and 2.5 mg/d. Doses of CLA at 10 mg/d and higher alleviated colitis symptoms and reduced inflammation induced by DSS, in which 40 mg/d, 20 mg/d and 10 mg/d CLA significantly increased the concentration of MUC2 and goblet cells, but neither 5 mg/d CLA nor 2.5 mg/d CLA had any effects. Meanwhile, 40 mg/d CLA and 20 mg/d CLA treatments significantly up-regulated the concentration of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin and claudin-3) and ameliorated epithelial apoptosis caused by DSS. Moreover, oxidative stress-related enzymes (SOD, GSH-PX, CAT) and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-10, IL-6) were modulated by 40 mg/d CLA and 20 mg/d CLA. Furthermore, 40 mg/d CLA rebalanced the gut  damaged by DSS, including reducing Bacteroides and increasing Bifidobacterium and Odoribacter.

However, little is known about its potential efficiency regarding polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans-contaminated soils. Thus, phytoremediation of aged dioxins/furans-contaminated soil was carried out through microcosm experiments vegetated with alfalfa combined with different amendments: an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal inoculum (), a biosurfactant (rhamnolipids), a dioxins/furans degrading-bacterium ( RW1), and native . The total dioxins/furans dissipation was estimated to 23%, which corresponds to 48 ng.kg of soil, after six months of culture in the vegetated soil combined with the four amendments compared to the non-vegetated soil. Our findings showed that the dioxins/furans dissipation resulted from the stimulation of soil microbial enzyme activities (fluorescein diacetate hydrolase and dehydrogenase) and the increase of bacterial abundance, richness, and diversity, as well as fungal diversity. Amplicon sequencing using Illumina MiSeq analysis led to identification of several bacterial (Bacillaceae, Sphingomonadaceae) and fungal () groups known to be involved in dioxins/furans degradation.

However, little is known about microbial metabolic reprogramming or the role it plays in regulating the fitness of commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the gut. Here, we report that intestinal inflammation reprograms the metabolic pathways of Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia coli LF82, in the gut to adapt to the inflammatory environment. We found that E. coli LF82 shifts its metabolism to catabolize L-serine in the inflamed gut in order to maximize its growth potential. However, L-serine catabolism has a minimal effect on its fitness in the healthy gut. In fact, the absence of genes involved in L-serine utilization reduces the competitive fitness of E. coli LF82 and Citrobacter rodentium only during inflammation. The concentration of luminal L-serine is largely dependent on dietary intake. Accordingly, withholding amino acids from the diet markedly reduces their availability in the gut lumen. Hence, inflammation-induced blooms of E. coli LF82 are significantly blunted when amino acids-particularly L-serine-are removed from the diet. Thus, the ability to catabolize L-serine increases bacterial fitness and provides Enterobacteriaceae with a growth advantage against competitors in the inflamed gut.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685464>cfr(B), (C), and a new -like gene, (E), in  strains recovered across Latin America.</a></h1><p>Cfr is a radical -adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) enzyme that confers cross-resistance to antibiotics targeting the 23S rRNA through hypermethylation of nucleotide A2503.

This finding could result from the translocation of still alive bacteria from gut to joints through blood, since the diversified dormant  of healthy human blood can be transiently resuscitated in vitro. The recent finding of gut microbiome in human cartilage, which differed between osteoarthritis and controls, suggests that a similar trafficking of dead or alive bacteria from gut  physiologically occurs between gut and epiphysial bone marrow. Subchondral  could enhance cartilage healing and transform components of deep cartilage matrix in metabolites with immunosuppressive properties. The differences of microbiome observed between hip and knee cartilage, either in osteoarthritis or controls, might be the counterpart of subtle differences in chondrocyte metabolism, themselves in line with differences in DNA methylation according to joints. Although bacteria theoretically cannot reach chondrocytes from the surface of intact cartilage, some bacteria enter the vascular channels of the epiphysial growth cartilage in young animals, whereas others can infect chondrocytes in vitro. In osteoarthritis, the early osteochondral plate angiogenesis may further enhance the ability of  to locate close to the deeper layers of cartilage, and this might lead to focal dysbiosis, low-grade inflammation, cartilage degradation, epigenetic changes in chondrocytes and worsening of osteoarthritis. More studies on cartilage across different ethnic groups, weights, and according to age, are needed, to confirm the silent presence of gut  close to human cartilage and better understand its physiologic and pathogenic significance.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, phenolics like flavan-3-ols (F3O) are poorly absorbed along the gastrointestinal tract and structurally rearranged by gut , yielding smaller and more polar metabolites like phenyl-γ-valerolactones, phenylvaleric acids and their conjugates. The present work investigated the ability of F3O-derived metabolites to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), by linking five experimental models with increasing realism. First, an in silico study examined the physical-chemical characteristics of F3O metabolites to predict those most likely to cross the BBB. Some of these metabolites were then tested at physiological concentrations to cross the luminal and abluminal membranes of brain microvascular endothelial cells, cultured in vitro. Finally, three different in vivo studies in rats injected with pure 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone, and rats and pigs fed grapes or a F3O-rich cocoa extract, respectively, confirmed the presence of 5-(hydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone-sulfate (3',4' isomer) in the brain. This work highlighted, with different experimental models, the BBB permeability of one of the main F3O-derived metabolites. It may support the neuroprotective effects of phenolic-rich foods in the frame of the "gut-brain axis".</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694526>Saccharomyces boulardii alleviates ulcerative colitis carcinogenesis in mice by reducing TNF-α and IL-6 levels and functions and by rebalancing intestinal .</a></h1><p>To explore the inhibition mechanism of Saccharomyces boulardii (S. boulardii) on ulcerative colitis (UC) carcinogenesis.C57BL/6 mice were treated with azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS) to develop a UC carcinogenesis model. The treatment group was lavaged with S. boulardii (5 × 10 CFU/d) for 12 weeks. The mice were sacrificed and the tumor load in the treatment group was compared with that of a control group. The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in colon tissue were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The influence of S. boulardii on TNF-α and IL-6 regulation was also investigated using different colon cell lines. Differences in intestinal  in both stool and intestinal mucosa samples were assessed using 16S rDNA sequencing.S. boulardii treatment reduced AOM/DSS-induced UC carcinogenesis in mice, as indicated by the reduced tumor load and reduced TNF-α and IL-6 levels in vivo, as well its effects on TNF-α and IL-6 activities in vitro. Significant changes in both fecal and mucosal  were observed among the control, the AOM/DSS treated, and AOM/DSS plus S. boulardii treated groups. For fecal , the AOM/DSS treated group was lower in Lactobacillus, but higher in Oscillibacter and Lachnoclostridium than the control group. After intervention with S. boulardii, the percentage of Bacillus and Lactococcus increased, but Lachnoclostridium, Oscillibacter, Bacteroides, and Pseudomonas decreased. For the intestinal mucosal , the AOM/DSS treated group was lower in Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 and higher in Alloprevotella than the control group. After S. boulardii exposure, the percentage contributions of Lachnoclostridium and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136 increased.S. boulardii effectively reduced UC carcinogenesis in an AOM/DSS induced mice model. This positive result can likely be attributed to the reduction of TNF-α and IL-6 levels or the blockade of their function combined with alterations to the intestinal .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684053>Quality and Safety of Fresh Chicken Fillets after High Pressure Processing: Survival of Indigenous  and Inoculated .</a></h1><p>The effect of high-pressure processing (HPP) on  , the indigenous  and the shelf-life of chicken fillets was evaluated. Chicken fillets were inoculated with different inocula (2, 4, and 6 log CFU/g) of a 4-strain cocktail of , vacuum-packed, processed or not with HPP (500 MPa/10 min) and stored at 4 °C and 12 °C. Total viable counts (TVC), ,  spp., , lactic acid bacteria (LAB),  and yeasts/molds were determined along with the pH and sensory analysis. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to monitor the succession of indigenous  isolates and inoculated  strains. The main spoilage microorganism of HPP-treated samples was  detected after 3 days of storage. HPP decreased the inoculated  population. For the low and medium inoculum case it was detected throughout the shelf-life at both temperatures in populations near to the detection limit or after enrichment. In the high inoculum case, the pathogen decreased ≥5-log cycles after HPP, while increased subsequently to 1.6 and 4.5 log CFU/g at 4 °C and 12 °C, respectively, by the end of the shelf-life. PFGE showed that  isolates exhibited a significant diversity among control samples, whereas this was limited for the HPP-treated samples. The survival and distribution of different  strains depended on the initial inoculum and storage temperature. In conclusion, HPP increased the shelf-life (for 5 and 4 days, at 4 °C and 12 °C, respectively) and enhanced the safety of chicken meat.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671757>Maternal Human Milk Oligosaccharide Profile Modulates the Impact of an Intervention with Iron and Galacto-Oligosaccharides in Kenyan Infants.</a></h1><p>There is little data on human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) composition in Sub-Saharan Africa. Iron fortificants adversely affect the infant gut , while co-provision of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) mitigates most of the adverse effects. Whether variations in maternal HMO profile can influence the infant response to iron and/or GOS fortificants is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine HMO profiles and the secretor/non-secretor phenotype of lactating Kenyan mothers and investigate their effects on the maternal and infant gut , and on the infant response to a fortification intervention with 5 mg iron (2.5 mg as sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate and 2.5 mg as ferrous fumarate) and 7.5 g GOS. We studied mother-infant pairs ( = 80) participating in a 4-month intervention trial in which the infants (aged 6.5-9.5 months) received daily a micronutrient powder without iron, with iron or with iron and GOS. We assessed: (1) maternal secretor status and HMO composition; (2) effects of secretor status on the maternal and infant gut  in a cross-sectional analysis at baseline of the intervention trial; and (3) interactions between secretor status and intervention groups during the intervention trial on the infant gut , gut inflammation, iron status, growth and infectious morbidity. Secretor prevalence was 72% and HMOs differed between secretors and non-secretors and over time of lactation. Secretor status did not predict the baseline composition of the maternal and infant gut . There was a secretor-status-by-intervention-group interaction on  ( = 0.021), Z-scores for length-for-age ( = 0.022) and weight-for-age ( = 0.018), and soluble transferrin receptor ( = 0.041). In the no iron group, longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea was higher among infants of non-secretors (23.8%) than of secretors (10.4%) ( = 0.001). In conclusion, HMO profile may modulate the infant gut  response to fortificant iron; compared to infants of secretor mothers, infants of non-secretor mothers may be more vulnerable to the adverse effect of iron but also benefit more from the co-provision of GOS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669656>A method to assess bioavailability of antibiotics in anthropogenic polluted ecosystems by using a bacterial fitness test.</a></h1><p>Antibiotics released in the environment exert a selective pressure on the resident . It is well accepted that the mere measurement of antibiotics does not reflect the actual bioavailability. In fact, antibiotics can be adsorbed or complexed to particles and/or chemicals in water and soil. Bioavailable concentrations of antibiotics in soil and water are subjected to great uncertainty, therefore biological assays are increasingly recognized as that allow an indirect determination of the residual antibiotic activity. Here we propose how a fitness test for bacteria can be used to qualitatively assess the bioavailability of a specific antibiotic in the environment. The findings show that by using a pair of resistant and sensitive bacterial strains, the resulting fitness can indirectly reflect antibiotic bioavailability. Hence, this test can be used as a complementary assay to other biological and chemical tests to assess bioavailability of antibiotics.Copyright © 2018.

The commensal  is known to contribute to IgA production in the gut; however, the role of dietary antigens in IgA production is poorly understood. To understand the effect of dietary antigens on IgA production, post-weaning mice were maintained on an elemental diet without any large immunogenic molecules. We found that dietary antigens contribute to IgA production in PPs through induction of follicular helper T cells and germinal center B cells. The role of dietary antigens in the PP responses was further confirmed by adding bovine serum albumin (BSA) into the elemental diet. Although dietary antigens are important for PP responses, they have fewer effects than the  on the development and maturation of ILFs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that dietary antigens are essential for a normal antigen-specific IgA response to  serovar Typhimurium infection.

Vancomycin, the antimicrobial agent usually used to treat bacterial nosocomial infections, is associated with gut dysbiosis. As a lung-gut immunologic axis has been described, this study aimed to evaluate both the immunologic and histopathologic effects on the lungs and the large intestine resulting from vancomycin-induced gut dysbiosis in the P. aeruginosa pneumonia murine model. Metagenomic analysis demonstrated that vancomycin-induced gut dysbiosis resulted in higher Proteobacteria and lower Bacteroidetes populations in feces. Given that gut dysbiosis could augment the proinflammatory status of the intestines leading to a variety of acute inflammatory diseases, bone marrow-derived macrophages were stimulated with cecal content from dysbiotic mice showing a higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines and lower expression of IL-10. Dysbiotic mice showed higher levels of viable bacteria in the lungs and spleen when acutely infected with P. aeruginosa, with more lung and cecal damage and increased IL-10 expression in bronchoalveolar lavage. The susceptible and tissue damage phenotype was reversed when dysbiotic mice received fecal  transplantation. In spite of higher recruitment of CD11b+ cells in the lungs, there was no higher CD80+ expression, DC+ cell amounts or proinflammatory cytokine expression. Taken together, our results indicate that the bacterial community found in vancomycin-induced dysbiosis dysregulates the gut inflammatory status, influencing the lung-gut immunologic axis to favor increased opportunistic infections, for example, by P. aeruginosa.©2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695016>Dietary Fat Influences the Expression of Genes Related to Sterol Metabolism and the Composition of Cecal  and Its Metabolites in Rats.</a></h1><p>Numerous studies have evaluated the composition of gut  in experimental animals fed high-fat or low-fiber diets. However, few reports have focused on the effects of different fatty acid (FA) compositions on the diversity of gut  and its metabolites. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the effects of different dietary fats on liver mRNA expression levels of genes related to cholesterol and bile acid (BA) metabolism, as well as to investigate cecal  composition and bacterial metabolites composition in rats. Four-week-old male Wistar/ST rats were fed a 15% fat diet for 30 days, including from different sources (soybean oil, lard, menhaden oil, or tuna oil). Then, the rats' cecal  composition was determined by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene using next-generation sequencing. Lard diet drastically decreased the expression level of liver ATP-binding cassette subfamily G genes (Abcg5 and Abcg8 genes) compared with other diets. Menhaden oil diet increased the fecal BA excretion compared with soybean oil and lard diets. Fecal BA excretion tended to be positively correlated with the relative abundance of Firmicutes, and negatively correlated with the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes. These results have shown that dietary fats with different FA compositions have a different effect on the relative composition of cecal , and in particular, menhaden oil may have very different effects compared to other experimental fats. The effects of fish oils on the cecal  may differ greatly depending on the ratio of EPA to DHA and the composition of FA other than n-3 polyunsaturated FA. Our results provided new insights on the way different dietary fat sources affect sterol metabolism and alter cecal  composition in rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687412>Gut  Modulation on Intestinal Mucosal Adaptive Immunity.</a></h1><p>The mammalian intestine harbors a remarkable number of microbes and their components and metabolites, which are fundamental for the instigation and development of the host immune system. The intestinal innate and adaptive immunity coordinate and interact with the symbionts contributing to the intestinal homeostasis through establishment of a mutually beneficial relationship by tolerating to symbiotic  and retaining the ability to exert proinflammatory response towards invasive pathogens. Imbalance between the intestinal immune system and commensal organisms disrupts the intestinal microbiological homeostasis, leading to  dysbiosis, compromised integrity of the intestinal barrier, and proinflammatory immune responses towards symbionts. This, in turn, exacerbates the degree of the imbalance. Intestinal adaptive immunity plays a critical role in maintaining immune tolerance towards symbionts and the integrity of intestinal barrier, while the innate immune system regulates the adaptive immune responses to intestinal commensal bacteria. In this review, we will summarize recent findings on the effects and mechanisms of gut  on intestinal adaptive immunity and the plasticity of several immune cells under diverse microenvironmental settings.Copyright © 2019 Li Wang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697827>The primacy of gastrointestinal tract antigen presenting cells in lethal graft-versus-host disease.</a></h1><p>Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains a cornerstone of curative therapy for high-risk and/or advanced hematological malignancies but remains limited by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD is initiated by the interaction between recipient antigen presenting cells (APC) and donor T-cells, culminating in T-cell differentiation along pathogenic type-1 (Th1/Tc1) and type-17 (Th17/Tc17) paradigms, at the expense of tolerogenic regulatory T-cell (Treg/Tr1) patterns. Type-1 and type-17 T-cells secrete cytokines (e.g. GM-CSF and IFNg) critical to the cytokine storm that amplifies donor APC expansion and their alloantigen presentation. It is become increasingly clear that pathogenic donor T-cell differentiation is initiated by both professional recipient APC (e.g. dendritic cells (DC)) and non-professional APC (e.g. epithelial and mesenchymal), particularly within the GI-tract. In the immediate peri-transplant period, these APC are profoundly modified by PAMP/DAMP signals derived from conditioning and intestinal . Subsequently donor DC in the GI-tract are activated by DAMP/PAMP signals in the colon that gain access to the lamina propria once the mucosal barrier mucosa is compromised by GVHD. This results in donor DC expansion and alloantigen presentation in the colon, and their subsequent migration into the mesenteric lymph nodes. Here, new donor T-cells are primed, expanded, differentiated and imprinted with gut-homing integrins permissive of migration into the damaged GI-tract, resulting in the lethal feed-forward cascade of GVHD. These new insights into our understanding of the cellular and molecular factors initiating GVHD, both spatially and temporally, give rise to a number of logical therapeutic targets, focusing on the inhibition of APC function in the GI-tract.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Hematology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683517>Immunomodulatory Effect of Gut -Derived Bioactive Peptides on Human Immune System from Healthy Controls and Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p>Bioactive peptides secreted by probiotic  (peptide B7) and opportunistic pathogen  (peptide B12) modulate the intestinal cytokine milieu in health. Here, we characterized their capacity to modulate both the mucosal cytokine production and the phenotype of circulating antigen presenting cells (APCs) in active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The IBD mucosa produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines referred to healthy controls (HCs). Peptides B7 and B12, however, did not ameliorate the mucosal cytokine milieu in IBD. Human circulating APCs (B-cells, monocytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs)) were characterized by flow cytometry in presence/absence of the peptides. Circulating B-cells, monocytes, and cDCs from IBD patients were more activated than those from HCs. Peptide B7, but not B12, decreased CCR2 expression on all APC subsets from HC, but not IBD patients. Moreover, both peptides tend to further increase their pro-inflammatory profile in IBD. In summary, IBD patients display mucosal and circulating APC pro-inflammatory properties. Peptide B7 immunomodulatory capacity elicited over circulating APCs from HC, but not IBD patients, suggests the presence of disrupted modulatory mechanisms for this peptide in IBD.

However, the relationship between fecal  and hematologic malignancy requires further investigation. This study aimed to characterize the relationship of the fecal microbial community in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 40 MM patients and healthy controls (n=17) were retrospectively collected from the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University between October 2018 and May 2019. The fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing for the fecal microbial community, as well as diversity and correlation analysis. Furthermore, 21 MM patients and their family members were selected for the matched pair analysis to confirm the fecal  taxonomic changes by qRT-PCR assay. RESULTS Diversity analysis showed that diversity measured by Shannon index was lower in MM patients compared with healthy controls. At the phylum level, higher abundances of Proteobacteria but lower abundances of Actinobacteria were identified in the MM group in comparison with the healthy control group. At the genus level, the proportion of Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Roseburia was significantly higher in the MM group. The matched pair analysis showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Faecalibacterium were significantly more abundant in the MM group. Further analysis on prognostic risk factors revealed that the Faecalibacterium prausnitzii level was significantly correlated with ISS stage. CONCLUSIONS Our study highlights the imbalanced composition and diversity of the gastrointestinal microbiome in MM patients, which could be further used as a potential biomarker for MM risk screening, therapeutic strategies, and prognostic prediction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680787>The Duplex Interaction of Microbiome with Chemoradiation and Immunotherapy: Potential Implications for Colorectal Cancer.</a></h1><p>Gut  has the ability to modify the metabolism of wide array of therapeutic drugs. Current treatment modalities used in colorectal cancer have a narrow therapeutic index with a side effects profile that decreases tolerance to these treatments and adversely affects treatment outcome. Harnessing the gut  ability to modify oncotherapeutic drugs metabolism and hence efficacy, could be potentially used to improve treatment outcomes in colorectal cancer patients.

Dysbiosis is associated with proinflammatory and pathological state-like metabolic diseases, autoimmune diseases and HIV infection. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the possible role of dysbiosis in triggering and/or exacerbating symptoms of autoimmune diseases and HIV infection. There are no data about the influence of the microbiome on the development of autoimmune diseases during HIV infection. We can hypothesize that untreated patients may be more susceptible to the development of autoimmune diseases, due to the presence of dysbiosis. Eubiosis, re-established by probiotic administration, can be used to reduce triggers for autoimmune diseases in untreated HIV patients, although clinical studies are needed to evaluate the role of the microbiome in autoimmune diseases in HIV patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680550>Influences of melatonin and endotoxin lipopolysaccharide on goose productive performance and gut .</a></h1><p>1.

Monomeric flavan-3-ols are rapidly absorbed in the small intestine and released in the blood stream as phase II conjugates. Polymeric flavan-3-ols are extensively metabolized by colonic gut  into phenyl-γ-valerolactones and their related phenylvaleric acids. These molecules are the main circulating metabolites in humans after the ingestion of flavan-3-ol rich-products; nevertheless, they have received less attention and their role is not understood yet. Here, we describe the quantification of 8 phenyl-γ-valerolactones and 3 phenylvaleric acids in the urine of 11 subjects on consumption of apples by using UHPLC-ESI-Triple Quad-MS with pure reference compounds. Phenyl-γ-valerolactones, mainly as sulfate and glucuronic acid conjugates, reached maximum excretion between 6 and 12 after apple consumption, with a decline thereafter. Significant differences were detected in the cumulative excretion rates within subjects and in the ratio of dihydroxyphenyl-γ-valerolactone sulfate to glucuronide conjugates.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were supplemented with d-fagomine, ω-3 PUFAs, or both, for 23 weeks. Bacterial subgroups were evaluated in fecal DNA by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and short-chain fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography. We found that the populations of the genus  remained stable over time in animals supplemented with d-fagomine, independently of ω-3 PUFA supplementation. Animals in these groups gained less weight than controls and rats given only ω-3 PUFAs. d-Fagomine supplementation together with ω-3 PUFAs maintained the relative populations of . ω-3 PUFAs alone or combined with d-fagomine reduced the amount of acetic acid and total short-chain fatty acids in feces.

Here we tested the hypothesis that maternal exercise before and during pregnancy would positively affect glucose homeostasis, pancreatic cell function, and gut  dysbiosis in high-fat diet (HFD) fed dams. Female C57BL/6 mice were fed either a HFD or a low-fat diet (LFD) for 12 weeks. The HFD mice were split into two groups for 4 weeks prior to pregnancy initiation and throughout the pregnancy: sedentary (HFD) or exercised (HFD + Ex). Food intake, body weight, body composition, and glucose and insulin tolerance were measured. At gestation day 19, blood, pancreas, gonadal visceral and subcutaneous fat, plantaris muscle, and cecum were collected for analysis. Both HFD and HFD + Ex mice had impaired glucose clearance compared to LFD mice at 15 days of gestation. No changes were found in pancreatic α- or β-cell health. HFD + Ex mice had significantly reduced visceral fat mass, serum insulin, and leptin levels and increased high-density lipoprotein levels, compared to HFD-fed mice. In contrast to our hypothesis,  diversity and composition were not different among groups. The relative abundance of five bacterial phyla, such as Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Deferribacteres, and Actinobacteria, were not significantly altered with diet or exercise during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that maternal exercise prevents excess visceral fat accumulation, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia associated with a HFD, but not through the alterations of gut  composition or diversity during pregnancy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The association of glycans to the bacterial cell surface is typically mediated by carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs). Here we report the structure of RiCBM86 appended to a GH10 xylanase from Roseburia intestinalis. This CBM represents a new family of xylan binding CBMs present in xylanases from abundant and prevalent healthy human gut Clostridiales. RiCBM86 adopts a canonical β-sandwich fold, but shows structural divergence from known CBMs. The structure of RiCBM86 has been determined with a bound xylohexaose, which revealed an open and shallow binding site. RiCBM86 recognizes only a single xylosyl ring with direct hydrogen bonds. This mode of recognition is unprecedented amongst previously reported xylan-binding type-B CBMs that display more extensive hydrogen-bonding patterns to their ligands or employ Ca to mediate ligand binding. The architecture of RiCBM86 is consistent with an atypically low binding affinity (K ≈0.5 mM for xylohexaose) compared to most xylan binding CBMs. Analyses using NMR spectroscopy corroborated the observations from the complex structure and the preference of RiCBM86 to arabinoxylan over glucuronoxylan, consistent with the largely negatively charged surface flanking the binding site. Mutational analysis and affinity electrophoresis established the importance of key binding residues, which are conserved in the family.

As such, the gut-liver axis enables the host to control and shape the gut  and to protect the intestinal barrier. Gut -host communication is based on several gut-derived compounds, such as short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, methylamines, amino acid-derived metabolites, and microbial-associated molecular patterns, which act as communication signals, and multiple host receptors, which sense the signals, thereby stimulating signaling and metabolic pathways in all key tissues of energy metabolism and food intake regulation.

We measured the copy numbers of 16S rRNA and the serum and BALF cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, receptor for advanced glycation end products, and angiopoietin-2).We analyzed 47 mechanically ventilated patients diagnosed with (n = 40) or without (n = 7; control) ARDS. The alpha diversity was significantly decreased in ARDS patients compared with that of the controls (6.24 vs. 8.07, P = 0.03). The 16S rRNA gene copy numbers tended to be increased in the ARDS group compared with the controls (3.83 × 10 vs. 1.01 × 10 copies/mL, P = 0.06). ARDS patients were subdivided into the hospital survivor (n = 24) and non-survivor groups (n = 16). Serum IL-6 levels were significantly higher in the non-survivors than in the survivors (567 vs. 214 pg/mL, P = 0.027). The 16S rRNA copy number was significantly correlated with serum IL-6 levels in non-survivors (r = 0.615, P < 0.05). The copy numbers and relative abundance of betaproteobacteria were significantly lower in the non-survivors than in the survivors (713 vs. 7812, P = 0.012; 1.22% vs. 0.08%, P = 0.02, respectively). Conversely, the copy numbers of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Enterobacteriaceae were significantly correlated with serum IL-6 levels in the non-survivors (r = 0.579, P < 0.05; r = 0.604, P < 0.05; r = 0.588, P < 0.05, respectively).The lung bacterial burden tended to be increased, and the alpha diversity was significantly decreased in ARDS patients. The decreased Betaproteobacteria and increased Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Enterobacteriaceae might represent a unique microbial community structure correlated with increased serum IL-6 and hospital mortality.The institutional review boards of Hiroshima University (Trial registration: E-447-4, registered 16 October 2019) and Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine (Trial registration: ERB-C-973, registered 19 October 2017) approved an opt-out method of informed consent.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689559>Abnormal Eating Patterns Cause Circadian Disruption and Promote Alcohol-Associated Colon Carcinogenesis.</a></h1><p>Alcohol intake with circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) increases colon cancer risk. We hypothesized that eating during or around physiologic rest time, a common habit in modern society, causes CRD and investigated the mechanisms by which it promotes alcohol-associated colon carcinogenesis.Effect of feeding time on CRD was assessed using B6 PER2::LUC mice. TS4Cre×APC mice were used to model colon polyposis and to assess the effects of feeding schedules, alcohol consumption, and prebiotic treatment on  composition, short-chain-fatty-acid (SCFA) levels, colon inflammation and cancer risk. The relationship between butyrate signaling and a proinflammatory profile was assessed by inactivating the butyrate receptor GPR109A.Eating at rest (Wrong-time eating: WTE) shifted the phase of the colon rhythm PER2::LUC mice. In TS4Cre×APC mice, a combination of WTE and alcohol exposure (WTE+Alcohol) decreased the levels of SCFA-producing bacteria and of butyrate, reduced colonic densities of Tregs, induced a proinflammatory profile, characterized by hyperpermeability and an elevated mucosal Th17/Treg ratio, and promoted CRC. Prebiotic treatment improved the mucosal inflammatory profile and attenuated inflammation and cancer. WTE+Alcohol-induced polyposis was associated with increased STAT3 expression. Decreased butyrate signaling activated epithelial STAT3 in vitro. The relationship between butyrate signaling and a proinflammatory profile was confirmed in human colorectal cancers using The Cancer Genome Atlas.Abnormal timing of food intake caused CRD and interacts with alcohol consumption to promote colon carcinogenesis by inducing a pro-tumorigenic inflammatory profile driven by changes in the colon  and butyrate signaling.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, the vaginal ecosystem can be thrown off balance by a wide variety of factors. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection in women of childbearing age, but its etiology is not yet fully understood, with different controversial theories being raised over the years. What is generally accepted is that BV is often characterized by a shift in the composition of the normal vaginal , from a Lactobacillus species dominated  to a mixture of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria. During BV, a polymicrobial biofilm develops in the vaginal microenvironment, being mainly composed of Gardnerella species. The interactions between vaginal microorganisms are thought to play a pivotal role in the shift from health to disease and might also increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections acquisition. Here we review the current knowledge regarding the specific interactions that occur in the vaginal niche and discuss mechanisms by which these interactions might be mediated. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of novel strategies to fight chronic vaginal infections.© FEMS 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671369>Activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor by dioxin directly shifts gut  in zebrafish.</a></h1><p>Gut  is of critical importance to host health. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is found to be closely involved in the regulation of gut microbial dynamics. However, it is still not clear how AhR signaling shapes the gut . In the present study, adult zebrafish were acutely exposed to an AhR antagonist (CH223191), an AhR agonist (polychlorinated biphenyl 126; PCB126) or their combination for 7 d. Overall intestinal health and gut microbial community were temporally monitored (1 d, 3 d and 7 d) and inter-compared among different groups. The results showed that single exposure to PCB126 significantly disrupted the overall health of intestines (i.e., neural signaling, inflammation, epithelial barrier integrity, oxidative stress). However, CH223191 failed to inhibit but enhanced the physiological toxicities of PCB126, implying the involvement of extra mechanisms rather than AhR in the regulation of intestinal physiological activities. Dysbiosis of gut  was also caused by PCB126 over time as a function of sex. It is intriguing that CH223191 successfully abolished the holistic effects of dioxin on gut , which inferred that growth of gut microbes was directly controlled by AhR activation without the involvement of host feedback modulation. When coming to detailed alterations at certain taxon, both antagonistic and synergistic interactions existed between CH223191 and dioxin, depending on fish sex, exposure duration and bacterial species. Correlation analysis found that gut inflammation was positively associated with pathogenic Legionella bacteria, but was negatively associated with epithelial barrier integrity, suggesting that integral intestinal epithelial barrier can prevent the influx of pathogenic bacteria to induce inflammatory response. Overall, this study has deciphered, for the first time, the direct regulative effects of AhR activity on gut . Future research is warranted to elucidate the specific mechanisms of AhR action on certain bacterial population.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of inoculation with three Lactobacillus species on the chemical parameters and microbiological quality (beneficial and harmful ) of grass silage.Three species: L. paracasei-LPa, L. brevis-LB and L. plantarum-LPl, isolated from sugar beet silage and characterized based on 16S rDNA sequences and biochemical parameters, were analyzed in the study. Single strains and their combinations were used as silage inoculants. The basic chemical and microbiological (qPCR) parameters of silages were determined. Based on the results of AHC and PCA, it was determined that silages inoculated with single LAB strains and LPa+LB and commercial additive (0+) were characterized by the best quality, particularly with regard to microbiological parameters and as the only one from the tested variants, it lowered the pH significantly. A consortium of three Lactobacillus species had no influence on silage quality, whereas LPa+LB and LPl+LB combinations as well as a commercial additive exerted positive effects. Inoculation inhibited the growth of toxin-producing fungi.Only the appropriate LAB composition can improve the quality of the ensiled material (antagonistic relationship). Only combination LPa+LB was able to improve the value of low dry silage, nevertheless, almost all combinations were able to reduced concentrations of toxin-producing fungi.

The reported prevalence rate of complete IgA deficiency in healthy children ranges from 1:170 to 1:400, and as a solitary condition, it is often considered of limited clinical importance. However, patients with IgA deficiency can develop recurrent respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, as well as allergic and autoimmune diseases. In children referred for recurrent respiratory tract infections, the observed prevalence rate increases more than tenfold. This review discusses several aspects of IgA deficiency in children, including immunologic and microbiome changes in early childhood and the potential consequences of this condition in later life. It illustrates the importance of early identification of children with impaired IgA production who deserve appropriate clinical care and follow-up.Copyright © 2019.

In addition, an association between gut  and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is widely observed in previously published reports. This meta-analysis critically examines the association between gut , and oxidative stress in T2DM.A systematic search for clinical trials was performed in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus web databases up to 1 Jan 2019. Primary search terms include "", "diabetes", and "oxidative stress". Study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. All clinical trials that compared the effects of probiotic supplementations with a control group using end points serum levels of fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) and oxidative stress biomarkers were included. Two independent researchers screened the data extracted from the relevant studies. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) was estimated using the random or fixed effects model. Heterogeneity among the studies was assessed using Q-test.Overall, 13 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving 840 subjects with T2DM were included in the meta-analysis. The analysis showed that probiotics intake resulted in significant improvement in serum levels of FBS [SMD: -0.35, 95% CI: (-0.59, -0.12)], total antioxidant status (TAS) [SMD: 0.33, 95% CI: (0.11, 0.55)], total glutathione (GSH) [SMD: 0.41, 95% CI: (0.26, 0.56)] and malondialdehyde (MDA) [SMD: -0.54, 95% CI: (-0.83, -0.26)]. No significant improvement was found in HbA1C [SMD: -0.06, 95% CI:(-0.82, 0.69)], and nitric oxide (NO) [SMD:-0.24, 95% CI:(-1.10, 0.62)] levels.It seems that gut  can exert beneficial effects in diabetic patients via altering oxidative stress' biomarkers. The beneficial effect of gut  however was modest on FBS and non-significant on HbA1C. These results need to be confirmed by conducting more reliable RCTs.CRD42019134905.

Here, we examine the airway  during the first three months of life by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in the population-based Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC) cohort consisting of 700 children monitored for the development of asthma since birth. Microbial diversity and the relative abundances of Veillonella and Prevotella in the airways at age one month are associated with asthma by age 6 years, both individually and with additional taxa in a multivariable model. Higher relative abundance of these bacteria is furthermore associated with an airway immune profile dominated by reduced TNF-α and IL-1β and increased CCL2 and CCL17, which itself is an independent predictor for asthma.

IGFs take part in the embryonal development and postnatal growth, in interaction with the growth hormone (GH). The physiological effects of IGF1 are promotion of tissue growth and development, stimulation of cell proliferation, effects on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anabolic, anti-oxidant, neuro- and hepatoprotective properties. Our knowledge about the GH/IGF axis is diverse, partly contradictory, their research is continued intensively nowadays. We considered it worthwhile to review and interpret this information. Study on GH/IGF medical reports, with particular reference to the less known metabolic control. 75% of the growth factors are produced in the liver by GH and insulin stimulation; their effects are expressed on specific receptors, and modified by specific binding proteins. IGF1 directly increases the muscle mass, bone density, and the structure of the bones. Intestinal  induces secretion of IGF1, which promotes the development and remodeling of the bones. Short-chain fatty acids, produced in microbial fermented fibers, induce secretion of IGF1, suggesting that microbial activity also affects bone health  IGF1. IGF1 also has a direct and indirect glucose-lowering effect, enhances free fatty acid oxidation in the muscle, reducing the flow of free fatty acid into the liver, improving insulin signaling, resulting in the reduction of hepatic glucose output, and improves insulin sensitivity. IGF1 directly influences the expression of circadian BMAL1 in hypothalamic cells: this refers to the newly recognized 'zeitgeber' role of IGF1. The bioactivity of insulin-like peptides in the brain is characterized by neuronal survival, excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, maintenance of normal free fatty acid levels, improvement of cognitive function, protection against cell damage, neurogenesis and angiogenesis. The effects of IGF2 are less outlined, however, it has a relevant role in the development of the fetus, and acts protectively on the brain. Lack or over-expression of IGF1 can be detected or may causally associated in many pathological conditions. According to these collected data, insulin sensitivity may be improved by different pathways. The role of IGFs in these processes should be a task of future research.

The aim of this report was to use metagenomic analyses to investigate the relationship between the oral microbiome and caries in preschool children. A total of 25 preschoolers, aged 3 to 5 years old with severe early childhood caries (ECC), and 19 age-matched, caries-free children as controls were recruited. Saliva samples were collected from the participants and were subjected to metagenomic analyses, whereby the oral microbial communities were investigated. The metagenomic analyses revealed substantial  differences between the two groups, indicating apparent shifts of the oral microbiome present in the ECC group. At the species level, the ECC-enriched microbes included , ,  and  Interestingly,  and  exhibited apparent differences at the strain level but not the species level between the ECC and control groups. Functional examination showed that the ECC group displayed extensive alterations in metabolic genes/pathways/modules, including enriched functions in sugar metabolism. Finally, an SVM (support vector machine) classifier comprising seven species was developed and generated a moderately good performance in predicting caries onset (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 78.33%). Together, these findings indicate that caries is associated with considerable changes in the oral microbiome, some of which can potentially be exploited as therapeutic targets or diagnostic markers. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. .) Dental caries is a highly prevalent oral disease that can lead to severe dental damage and may greatly compromise the quality of life of the affected individuals. Previous studies, including those based on 16S rRNA gene, have revealed that the oral  plays a prominent role in development of the disease. But the approach of those studies was limited in analyzing several key microbiome traits, including species- or strain-level composition and functional profile. Here, we performed metagenomic analyses for a cohort of preschool children with or without caries. Our results showed that caries was associated with extensive  differences at various taxonomic and functional levels. Some caries-associated species had not been previously reported, some of which may have significant clinical implications. A microbiome gene catalogue from children with caries was constructed for the first time. The results demonstrated that caries is associated with alterations of the oral microbiome, including changes in microbial composition and metabolic functional profile.Copyright © 2019 Wang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685604>Ketone body receptor GPR43 regulates lipid metabolism under ketogenic conditions.</a></h1><p>Ketone bodies, including β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, are important alternative energy sources during energy shortage. β-Hydroxybutyrate also acts as a signaling molecule via specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs); however, the specific associated GPCRs and physiological functions of acetoacetate remain unknown. Here we identified acetoacetate as an endogenous agonist for short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) receptor GPR43 by ligand screening in a heterologous expression system. Under ketogenic conditions, such as starvation and low-carbohydrate diets, plasma acetoacetate levels increased markedly, whereas plasma and cecal SCFA levels decreased dramatically, along with an altered gut  composition. In addition, -deficient mice showed reduced weight loss and suppressed plasma lipoprotein lipase activity during fasting and eucaloric ketogenic diet feeding. Moreover, -deficient mice exhibited minimal weight decrease after intermittent fasting. These observations provide insight into the role of ketone bodies in energy metabolism under shifts in nutrition and may contribute to the development of preventive medicine via diet and foods.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Despite its lifesaving potential, immune-mediated allo-reactivity inherent to the allogeneic transplantation can be observed within up to 50% of all allo-HCT patients regularly resulting in the manifestation of acute and/or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Mechanistically, especially donor T cells are assumed to chiefly drive inflammation that can occur in virtually all organs, with the skin, liver, and gut representing as the most frequently affected anatomic sites. Especially in the presence of intestinal manifestations of GvHD, the risk that the disease takes a life-threatening, potentially fatal course is significantly increased.

Considering the lack of data assessing renal handling of TMAO, we conducted this study to explore renal excretion and mechanisms of accumulation of TMAO during CKD. We prospectively measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) with gold standard methods and plasma concentrations of trimethylamine (TMA), TMAO, choline, betaine, and carnitine by LC-MS/MS in 124 controls, CKD, and hemodialysis (HD) patients. Renal clearance of each metabolite was assessed in a sub-group of 32 patients. Plasma TMAO was inversely correlated with mGFR ( = 0.388,  < 0.001), confirming elevation of TMAO plasma levels in CKD. TMAO clearances were not significantly different from mGFR, with a mean ± SD TMAO fractional excretion of 105% ± 32%. This suggests a complete renal excretion of TMAO by glomerular filtration with a negligible participation of tubular secretion or reabsorption, during all stages of CKD. Moreover, TMAO was effectively removed within 4 h of hemodiafiltration, showing a higher fractional reduction value than that of urea (84.9% ± 6.5% vs. 79.2% ± 5.7%,  = 0.04). This study reports a strong correlation between plasma TMAO levels and mGFR, in CKD, that can be mainly related to a decrease in TMAO glomerular filtration.

What constitutes a unique feature of this model is its twofold objective of introducing an ileal microbial community and mimicking a dietary weaning transition. This model should then be ideally suited to test the dietary weaning strategies of piglets in vitro. Regarding the , the main phyla making up the model were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria although Bacteroidetes decreased after inoculation (p = 0.043 in ileum, p = 0.021 in colon) and Delta-Proteobacteria were favoured (p = 0.083 in ileum, p = 0.043 in colon) compared to Gamma-Proteobacteria. The designed model led to a low representation of Bacilli - especially Lactobacillus sp. in the ileum and a weak representation of Bacteroidia in the proximal colon. However, Mitsuokella and Prevotella were part of the major genera of the model along with Bifidobacterium, Fusobacterium, Megasphaera and Bacteroides. As a result of weaning, two major changes - normally occurring in vivo - were detected in the system: firstly, Firmicutes diminished when Bacteroidetes increased particularly in the proximal colon; secondly, Bacteroides decreased and Prevotella increased (mean value for four runs). In terms of metabolite production, while a ratio acetate: propionate: butyrate of 60:26:14 was obtained in post-weaned colon, the expected inversion of the ratio propionate: butyrate in the post-weaned ileum was unfortunately not observed. To conclude, the so-called baby-SPIME model meets expectations regarding the resident  of the proximal colon bioreactor and the metabolites produced thereof. In terms of the evolution of major groups of bacteria, the in vitro weaning process appeared to be successful. However, higher concentration of butyric acid would have been expected in ileum part of newly weaned piglets, as observed in vivo. The  in the ileum bioreactor seemed in fact to act like a pre-colon. This suggests that microbial profile in ileum bioreactor had to be improved.Copyright © 2019.

We conducted a microcosm study to explore the responses of the non-target soil invertebrate Enchytraeus crypticus gut  and resistomes to copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) and copper nitrate by using bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons sequencing and high throughput quantitative PCR. The results showed that exposure to Cu resulted in higher bioaccumulation (P < 0.05) and lower body weight and reproduction (P < 0.05) of Enchytraeus crypticus than exposure to CuO NPs. Nevertheless, exposure to CuO NPs for 21 days markedly increased the alpha-diversity of the gut  of Enchytraeus crypticus (P < 0.05) and shifted the gut microbial communities, with a significant decline in the relative abundance of the phylum Planctomycetes (from 37.26% to 19.80%, P < 0.05) and a significant elevation in the relative abundance of the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Acidobacteria (P < 0.05). The number of detected ARGs in the Enchytraeus crypticus gut significantly decreased from 45 in the Control treatment to 16 in the Cu(NO) treatment and 20 in the CuO NPs treatment. The abundance of ARGs in the Enchytraeus crypticus gut were also significantly decreased to 38.48% when exposure to Cu(NO) and 44.90% when exposure to CuO NPs (P < 0.05) compared with the controls. These results extend our understanding of the effects of metallic oxide nanoparticles on the gut  and resistome of soil invertebrates.Copyright © 2019.

Some fungal species are commensal organisms that are part of the normal human , and, as such, do not pose a threat to the immune system. However, when the natural balance of this association is disturbed or the host's immune system is compromised, these fungal pathogens overtake the organism, and cause IFI. To understand the invasiveness of these pathogens and to address the growing problem of IFI, it is essential to identify the cellular processes of the invading organism and their virulence. In this review, we will discuss the prevalence and current options available to treat IFI, including recent reports of drug resistance. Nevertheless, the main focus of this review is to describe the glycobiology of human fungal pathogens and how various components of the fungal cell wall, particularly cell wall polysaccharides and glycoconjugates, are involved in fungal pathogenicity, their biosynthesis and how they can be potentially exploited to develop novel antifungal treatment options. We will specifically describe the nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) that are important in fungal survival and suggest that the inhibition of fungal NSTs may potentially be useful to prevent the establishment of fungal infections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669313>Does the gut  contribute to the oligodendrocyte progenitor niche?</a></h1><p>The past decade has seen a growing number of studies on the relationship between the gut  and the brain. This mini-review will focus on the unexpected findings linking the microbiome to myelination. We first address the temporal correlation between the acquisition of a gut  in the developing organism and developmental myelination. We then review the factors impacting the composition of the child's gut , ranging from maternal stress to modality of delivery and from breastfeeding and diet composition to antibiotic treatment early in life. We discuss the topic of gut-brain communication with an emphasis on myelination, and propose the concept that gut microbes produce metabolites which may constitute a "metabolic" niche. Distinct bacterial communities may create very different "niches", some permissive and others inhibitory for myelin generation or maintenance. We speculate that this concept of "gut dysbiosis" may also in part explain the reduced myelin content detected in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. We conclude by envisioning intervention with probiotics and prebiotics to favor the formation of a microbial metabolic "niche" favoring myelin production to promote brain health.Copyright © 2019.

For this study, raw yak milk, qula, and fermented yak milk samples were collected from the Aba Tibetan autonomous region of China. The genus and species microbial composition of these samples were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and groEL gene amplicons, and the volatile profile of the samples was quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results indicated variation in abundance of  at the genus level among the fermented yak milk samples, with Lactobacillus as the most abundant genus in the majority of samples, ranging from 41.6 to 98.26%. The volatile profile of the samples varied among those collected from different villages. Correlations between bacterial composition and volatile compounds of the samples were also observed. Lactobacillus displayed a significant correlation with volatile compounds such as benzaldehyde, 2,3-pentanedione, ethanol, and ethyl acetate, whereas the samples with relatively high abundance of Streptococcus and Lactococcus displayed relatively low contents of volatile compounds.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

The present study aims to assess the impact of a high fat diet on tuberculosis progression and  composition in an experimental animal model using a C3HeB/FeJ mouse strain submitted to single or multiple consecutive aerosol infections. These models allowed us to study the protection induced by Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination as well as by the natural immunity induced by chemotherapy after a low dose  infection. Our results show that a high fat diet is able to trigger a pro-inflammatory response, which results in a faster progression toward active tuberculosis and an impaired protective effect of BCG vaccination, which is not the case for natural immunity. This may be related to dysbiosis and a reduction in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the gut  caused by a decrease in the abundance of the Porphyromonadaceae family and, in particular, the  genus. It should also be noted that a high fat diet is also related to an increase in the genera , and , which have previously been related to dysbiotic processes. As diabetes mellitus type 2 is a risk factor for developing tuberculosis, these findings may prove useful in the search for new prophylactic strategies for this population subset.Copyright © 2019 Arias, Goig, Cardona, Torres-Puente, Díaz, Rosales, Garcia, Tapia, Comas, Vilaplana and Cardona.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678829>Drugging the gut : toward rational modulation of bacterial composition in the gut.</a></h1><p>The human gastrointestinal tract hosts almost a trillion microorganisms, organized in a complex community known as the gut , an integral part of human physiology and metabolism.

Previously, it was thought that C. difficile was primarily a hospital-acquired infection, however, with the emergence of community-associated cases, and whole-genome sequencing suggesting the majority of the hospital C. difficile infection (CDI) cases are genetically distinct from one another, there is compelling evidence that sources/reservoirs of C. difficile outside hospitals play a significant role in the transmission of CDI.To review the 'One Health' aspects of CDI, focusing on how community sources/reservoirs might be acting as a conduit in the transfer of C. difficile between animals and humans. The importance of a One Health approach in managing CDI is discussed.A literature search was performed on PubMed and Web of Science for relevant papers published from 01 January 2000 to 10 July 2019.We present evidence that demonstrates transmission of C. difficile in hospitals from asymptomatic carriers to symptomatic CDI patients. The source of colonization is most probably community reservoirs, such as foods and the environment, where toxigenic C. difficile strains have frequently been isolated. With high-resolution genomic sequencing, the transmission of C. difficile between animals and humans is likely despite a clear epidemiological link often being absent. The ways in which C. difficile from animals and humans can disseminate through foods and the environment are discussed; and an interconnected transmission pathway for C. difficile involving food animals, humans and the environment is presented.C. difficile is a well-established pathogen of both humans and animals that contaminates foods and the environment.

In our previous study, we found that the absence of gut  can influence the expression of microRNAs and mRNAs in the hippocampal region of the germ-free (GF) mice. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly being recognized as an important functional transcriptional regulator in the brain. In the present study, we aim to identify possible biological pathways and functional networks for lncRNA-associated transcript of the gut  in relation to the brain function. The profiles of lncRNA and mRNA from specific pathogen-free (SPF), colonized GF (CGF), and GF mice were generated using the Agilent Mouse LncRNA Array v2.0. Differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified, and lncRNA target genes were also predicted. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was performed to analyze related signaling pathways and biological functions associated with these dysregulated mRNAs and target genes. Validation with quantitative real-time PCR was performed on several key genes. Compared with SPF mice a total of 2230 DE lncRNAs were found in GF mice. Among these, 1355 were upregulated and 875 were downregulated. After comparing the target genes of DE lncRNAs with mRNA datasets, 669 overlapping genes were identified. IPA core analyses revealed that most of these genes were highly associated with cardiac hypertrophy, nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFAT) gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), calcium, and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathways. Additionally, mRNA expression levels of APP, CASP9, IGFBP2, PTGDS, and TGFBR2 genes that are involved in central nervous system functions were significantly changed in the GF mouse hippocampus. Through this study, for the first time, we describe the effect of gut  on the hippocampal lncRNA regulation.

Among  detected in sewages, also belong representatives of the phylum . In the past, environmental enterococci in addition to coliforms were widely used as indicators of faecal contamination. Regarding the enterococcal strains as potential pathogenic bacteria, their pathogenicity is mainly caused by production of virulence factors. Therefore, the aim of the study was to analyse incidence of virulence factors in enterococci from cows' dung water. Species identification of 24 enterococci using MALDI-TOF MS system allotted 23 strains to the species  with highly probable species identification and  EEV20 with a score value meaning secure genus identification/probable species identification. Enterococci were absent of cytolysin A gene, hyaluronidase gene, and element IS gene. It can be concluded that they are not invasive which is very important from safety aspect.

In this study, we aim to investigate whether L-Arabinose could inhibit colitis by modulating gut . L-Arabinose was administrated in mice daily in a DSS-induced colitis model. The histological analysis, disease index and the expression of inflammatory genes were measured. 16S-rRNA sequence analysis was performed to investigate gut . Intriguingly, we found that L-Arabinose could repress DSS-induced colitis and inhibit p38-/p65-dependent inflammation activation. Besides that, our data revealed that L-Arabinose modulated gut  disturbed by DSS treatment. Additionally, by antibiotic treatment, the perturbed gut  was responsible for the suppressive effects of L-Arabinose on DSS-induced colitis. Lastly, Caco-2 cells was used to confirm the protective effects of L-Arabinose. As expected, the expression levels of pro-inflammatory proteins in Caco-2 cells treated with L-Arabinose in absence or presence of TNFα. Our work suggested that L-Arabinose exert anti-inflammation effect in DSS-induced colitis. These beneficial effects may be related to the diversity and composition of the gut  regulated by L-Arabinose.

This study evaluated the impact of a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and microalgae (Aurantiochytrium limacinum) supplementation on caecal, colonic and faecal microbial ecosystem and on blood inflammatory parameters of horses fed high-fibre or high-starch diets. Six fistulated geldings in a 2×2 Latin-square design were alternatively supplemented and received during each period 100% hay (4 weeks) followed by a 56/44 hay/barley diet (3 weeks). Caecal, colonic and faecal samples were collected 4h after the morning meal three times per diet, at 5-day intervals, to measure bacterial richness, diversity, and composition and microbial end-products. Blood was simultaneously collected for measuring inflammatory markers. The starchy diet clearly modified the microbial ecosystem in the three digestive segments, with an increase of the amylolytic function and a decrease of the fibrolytic one. However no effect of the diet was observed on the blood parameters. When horses were supplemented, no significant change was found in lipopolysaccharides, Prostaglandin-E2, Serum Amyloid A concentrations and complete blood count neither in cellulose-utilising, starch-utilising and lactate-utilising bacteria concentrations nor in the volatile fatty acids and lactate concentrations and pH. Under supplementation, relative abundance of Family XIII Clostridiales increased in caecum and faeces irrespective of diet, and relative abundance of Veillonellaceae was higher during hay/barley diet in colon and faeces. Most variations of faecal bacterial taxa under supplementation were not observed in the hindgut. However, all variations suggested that supplementation could increase the fibrolytic function whatever the diet, and limit dysbiosis when horses' diet changed from high-fibre to high-starch.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680836>Alterations of the Gut  in Multiple System Atrophy Patients.</a></h1><p>Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease, and the pathogenesis is still quite challenging.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the prevalence of AMR genes are increasing, and prediction of antimicrobial susceptibility based on sequence information could support targeted antimicrobial therapy in a clinical setting. Complete identification of insertion sequence (IS) elements carrying promoter sequences upstream of resistance genes is necessary for prediction of AMR. However,  assemblies from short reads alone are often fractured due to repeat regions and the presence of multiple copies of identical IS elements. Identification of plasmids in clinical isolates can aid in the surveillance of the dissemination of AMR, and comprehensive sequence databases support microbiome and metagenomic studies. We tested several short-read, hybrid and long-lead assembly pipelines by assembling the type strain  CCUG4856 (=ATCC25285=NCTC9343) with Illumina short reads and long reads generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION sequencing. Hybrid assembly with Unicycler, using quality filtered Illumina reads and Filtlong filtered and Canu-corrected ONT reads, produced the assembly of highest quality. This approach was then applied to six clinical multidrug-resistant  isolates and, with minimal manual finishing of chromosomal assemblies of three isolates, complete, circular assemblies of all isolates were produced. Eleven circular, putative plasmids were identified in the six assemblies, of which only three corresponded to a known cultured  plasmid. Complete IS elements could be identified upstream of AMR genes; however, there was not complete correlation between the absence of IS elements and antimicrobial susceptibility.

However, the specific responses of intestinal metabolome under simulated weightlessness and its relationship with the intestinal microbiome and immune characteristics remain largely unknown. In the current study, 20 adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into the control group and the simulated weightlessness group using a hindlimb unloading model. The metabolomic profiling of cecal contents from eight rats of each group was investigated by gas chromatography-time of flight/mass spectrometry. The significantly different metabolites, biomarkers, and related pathways were identified. Multivariate analysis, such as principal component analysis and orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis, demonstrated an obvious separation between the control group and the simulated weightlessness group. Significantly different metabolites, such as xylose, sinapinic acid, indolelactate, and digalacturonic acid, were identified, which participate in mainly pyrimidine metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and valine, leucine and isoleucine metabolism. Cytidine-5'-monophosphate, 4-hydroxypyridine, and phloretic acid were determined as pivotal biomarkers under simulated weightlessness. Moreover, the significantly different metabolites were remarkably correlated with dysbiosis of the intestinal  and disturbance of immunological characteristics induced by simulated weightlessness.

In patients with DT2, diabetic cardiomyopathy is a recognized cause of cardiac insufficiency secondary to chronic hyperglycaemia and myocardial lipotoxicity, which promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (and, frequently, apoptosis of these cells), interstitial fibrosis and a decrease in myocardial contractile performance. Several studies have shown that diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with modifications to the intestinal , and changes in the synthesis of bacterial metabolites and their diffusion into the host, some of which appear to have direct deleterious effects on cardiac contractility. These findings open up new perspectives for pathophysiological studies by establishing the presence of a '-myocardium' axis and raising the possibility of innovative new treatments.

The  also interacts with and metabolizes compounds produced by the host, such as primary bile acids. Lactate and bile acids (BA) are of particular interest in gastrointestinal diseases because they have been associated with metabolic acidosis and bile acid diarrhea, respectively. The objectives of this study were to validate an enzymatic assay to quantify D-, L-, and total lactate in canine feces, and to characterize fecal lactate and BA concentrations as well as bacterial abundances in healthy dogs and dogs with gastrointestinal diseases. Fecal samples were collected from 34 healthy dogs, 15 dogs with chronic enteropathy (CE), and 36 dogs with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). Lactate was quantified with an enzymatic assay, BA with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and 11 bacterial groups with qPCR. A fecal lactate reference interval was established from 34 healthy dogs and was 0.7-1.4 mM, 0.3-6.0 mM, and 1.0-7.0 mM for D-, L-, and total lactate, respectively. The assay to measure D-, L-, and total lactate in canine fecal samples was linear, accurate, precise, and reproducible. Significant increases in fecal lactate and decreases in secondary BA concentrations were observed in dogs with CE and dogs with EPI. Dogs with EPI had an increased abundance of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium; a decreased abundance of Fusobacterium and Clostridium hiranonis; and a higher Dysbiosis Index when compared to healthy dogs.

Alteration in the uterine , which is dependent on the nutrients and hormones available to the uterus, is likely to play an important role in uterine-related diseases such as hysteromyoma, adenomyosis, and endometriosis. Uterine mucosa is an important tissue barrier whose main function is to offer protection against pathogens and other toxic factors, while maintaining a symbiotic relationship with commensal microbes. These characteristics are shared by all the mucosal tissues; however, the uterine mucosa is unique since it changes cyclically during the menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy. The immune system, besides its role in the defense process, plays crucial roles in reproduction as it ensures local immune tolerance to fetal/paternal antigens, trophoblast invasion, and vascular remodeling. The human endometrium contains a conspicuous number of immune cells, mainly Natural Killers (NK) cells, which are phenotypically distinct from peripheral cytotoxic NK, cells and macrophages. The endometrium also contains few lymphoid aggregates comprising B cell and CD8 T cells. The number and the phenotype of these cells change during the menstrual cycle.

Recently, gut microbial metabolism was found to be important for maintaining correct physiology. Here, we describe the development and validation of a UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS method for targeted quantification of 39 metabolites related to tryptophan and tyrosine metabolism, branched chain amino acids and gut-derived metabolites in human plasma and urine. Extraction from plasma was optimised using 96-well plates, shown to be effective in removing phospholipids. Urine was filtered and diluted ten-fold. Metabolites were separated with reverse phase chromatography and detected using triple quadrupole MS. Linear ranges (from ppb to ppm) and correlation coefficients ( > 0.990) were established for both matrices independently and the method was shown to be linear for all tested metabolites. At medium spiked concentration, recovery was over 80% in both matrices, while analytical precision was excellent (CV < 15%). Matrix effects were minimal and retention time stability was excellent. The applicability of the methods was tested on biological samples, and metabolite concentrations were found to be in agreement with available data. The method allows the analysis of up to 96 samples per day and was demonstrated to be stable for up to three weeks from acquisition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672735>Whole-Genome Sequences of Five Strains of Kocuria rosea, NCTC2676, NCTC7514, NCTC7512, NCTC7528, and NCTC7511.</a></h1><p> is a Gram-positive coccus found in the environment and within normal human skin , and more recently, it has been potentially implicated as an opportunistic pathogen.

TRALI is one of the leading causes of transfusion-related fatalities and specific therapies are unavailable. Neutrophils are recognized as the major pathogenic cells, whereas T regulatory cells and dendritic cells appear to be important for protection against TRALI. The pathogenesis, however, is complex and incompletely understood. It is frequently postulated that the complement system plays an important role in the TRALI pathogenesis. In this article, we assess the evidence regarding the involvement of complement in TRALI from both human and animal studies. We hypothesize about the potential connection between the complement system and neutrophils in TRALI. Additionally, we draw parallels between TRALI and other acute pulmonary disorders of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome regarding the involvement of complement. We conclude that, even though a role for complement in the TRALI pathogenesis seems plausible, studies investigating the role of complement in TRALI are remarkably limited in number and also present conflicting findings. Different types of TRALI animal models, diverse experimental conditions, and the composition of the gastrointestinal  may perhaps all be factors which contribute to these discrepancies. More systematic studies are warranted to shed light on the contribution of the complement cascade in TRALI. The underlying clinical condition of the patient, which influences the susceptibility to TRALI, as well as the transfusion factor (antibody-mediated vs non-antibody-mediated), will be important to take into consideration when researching the contribution of complement. This should significantly increase our understanding of the role of complement in TRALI and may potentially result in promising new treatment strategies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It is currently unknown whether rectal swabs give comparable results to faecal samples regarding  community composition in neonates and infants. To study how well the two sampling methods correlate in infants, we compared the 16S-rRNA-based sequencing results of 131 paired rectal swabs and faecal samples collected from 116 infants at two timepoints in early life. The paired samples were highly comparable regarding both diversity and overall community composition, and strongly correlated on taxonomical level. We observed no significant nor relevant contribution of sampling method to the variation in overall gut  community composition in a multivariable model.

To investigate the prebiotic effect of patchouli essential oil (PEO) and its derived compounds through the modulation of gut  (GM). C57BL/6J mice were treated with the PEO and three active components of PEO,  patchouli alcohol (PA), pogostone (PO) and β-patchoulene (β-PAE) for 15 consecutive days. Fecal samples and mucosa were collected for GM biomarkers studies. PEO, PA, PO, and β-PAE improve the gut epithelial barrier by altering the status of E-cadherin vs. N-cadherin expressions, and increasing the mucosal p-lysozyme and Muc 2. Moreover, the treatments also facilitate the polarization of M1 to M2 macrophage phenotypes, meanwhile, suppress the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Fecal microbial DNAs were analyzed and evaluated for GM composition by ERIC-PCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The GM diversity was increased with the treated groups compared to the control. Further analysis showed that some known short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, , , , , and  were significantly enriched in the treated groups. In addition, the key SCFAs receptors, GPR 41, 43 and 109a, were significantly stimulated in the gut epithelial layer of the treated mice.

It is a complex disorder with numerous contributing (epi)genetic and environmental factors. Currently, treatment consists of behavioural and pharmacological therapy. However, ADHD medication is associated with several side effects, and concerns about long-term effects and efficacy exist. Therefore, there is considerable interest in the development of alternative treatment options. Double-blind research investigating the effects of a few-foods diet (FFD) has demonstrated a significant decrease in ADHD symptoms following an FFD. However, an FFD requires a considerable effort of both child and parents, limiting its applicability as a general ADHD treatment. To make FFD intervention less challenging or potentially obsolete, we need to understand how, and in which children, an FFD affects ADHD behaviour and, consequently, the child's well-being. We hypothesise that an FFD affects brain function, and that the nutritional impact on ADHD is effectuated by a complex interplay between the , gut and brain, that is, the -gut-brain axis.The Biomarker Research in ADHD: the Impact of Nutrition (BRAIN) study is an open-label trial with researchers blinded to changes in ADHD symptoms during sample processing and initial data analyses.The Medical Research and Ethics Committee of Wageningen University has approved this study (NL63851.081.17, application 17/24).

Gut  play pivotal roles in mediating psychological behaviors by regulating gut barrier integrity and systemic inflammatory responses. Here, we found that oral sesamin administration (50 mg/kg·bodyweight/day) significantly attenuated depressive, aversive, repetitive, and anxiety-like behaviors in a long-term multiple nonsocial stress-treated mice model. Sesamin inhibited stress-induced gut barrier integrity damage, reduced circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, and suppressed neuroinflammatory responses. Moreover, sesamin treatment also restructured the gut microbiome by enhancing the relative abundances of Bacteroidales and S24-7. The correlation analysis indicated that the  composition changes were strongly correlated with behavioral disorders, serotonin, norepinephrine, and LPS levels. In conclusion, sesamin has preventive effects on stress-induced behavioral and psychological disorders, which might be highly related to the reshaped  composition.

Therefore, we examined the allergic rhinitis (AR)-inhibitory effects of water-extracted RG (wRG), 50% ethanol-extracted RG (eRG), and bifidobacteria-fermented eRG (fRG) in vivo.RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate/A23187. Mice with AR were prepared by treatment with ovalbumin. Allergic markers IgE, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-5 were assayed in the blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, nasal mucosa, and colon using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mast cells, eosinophils, and Th2 cell populations were assayed using a flow cytometer.RG products potently inhibited IL-4 expression in phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate/A23187-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. Of tested RG products, fRG most potently inhibited IL-4 expression. RG products also alleviated ovalbumin-induced AR in mice. Of these, fRG most potently reduced nasal allergy symptoms and blood IgE levels. fRG treatment also reduced IL-4 and IL-5 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, nasal mucosa, and reduced mast cells, eosinophils, and Th2 cell populations.

The HAP strain isolated from roach intestine was Enterococcus faecium strain CGMCC1.2136. The experiment was a simple completely randomized design and lasted for eight weeks. Two hundred and seventy fish with an average weight of 12 g randomly distributed into nine tanks. The trial consisted of three treatments with three respective replications. During the experimental period, fish received basal diet without any bacterial supplementation (as the control group), basal diet enriched with 10 CFU g HAP or 10 CFU g CP. At the end of the experiment, serum immune parameters of those fish fed HAP including alkaline phosphatase activity, total protein content, total immunoglobulin level, lysozyme activity and complement activity (ACH50) were significantly higher that other experimental groups (P < 0.05). Similarly, dietary supplementation of HAP resulted in better mucosal immune parameters in comparison to control group and commercial probiotic administration (P < 0.05). Intestinal heterotrophic bacteria and autochthonous LAB counts of those fish fed HAP were significantly higher than other experimental groups at the end of the experiment as well as 15 days seizing probiotic administrations (P < 0.05). Fish fed with HAP containing diet presented significantly higher amylase, lipase and protease activity in comparison to the CP fed fish and the control group (P < 0.05). Growth indices of those fish fed HAP were significantly higher than other treatments (P < 0.05). The highest carcass protein and ash content along with the lowest body moisture content belonged to those fish received HAP (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the use host-HAP resulted in better immune competence and growth performance and it seems aquaculture sector should probably focus on the development of probiotics isolated from the cultured species instead of using terrestrial probiotics with greatly different requirements and environmental conditions.Copyright © 2019.

Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal  were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/B index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate metabolism" were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and energy utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids (caproate, 2-methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic  to increase utilization of carbohydrates and energy, enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The objective of FMT is to re-establish a healthy and diverse gut microbial environment, and FMT has been used in patients with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). From 2009 to 2015, over 20,623 adult patients were reported to have Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), according to the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program. Approximately 233,000 Canadians are living with IBD, and an estimated 18% of Canadians are living with IBS. FMT is used with the aim of fostering a healthy microbial environment in the gastrointestinal tract in these populations. FMT may be administered via different preparations. Lyophilized FMT is prepared by freezing a filtered stool sample solution from a healthy donor, then freeze drying the sample through sublimation to a powder form. It can be administered orally and through colonoscopy. In contrast, frozen FMT treatment involves freezing filtered stool samples at −80°C, thawing prior to administration, then administrating orally, by enema or via colonscopy. It is suggested that lyophilized FMT is easier to store (e.g., at standard refrigerator temperature of 4°C) and that the powder material is easier to encapsulate.

Therefore, it is crucial to investigate farm management practices such as the bedding materials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of recycled manure solids (RMS) as bedding material on bulk tank milk and microbiological implications for cheese quality. Bulk tank samples were collected from 84 dairy farms using RMS or straw bedding. The use of RMS did not influence thermophilic and mesophilic aerobic viable counts from spores. However, straw-milk samples gave higher values for mesophilic anaerobic spore-forming bacteria (0.44 log cfu/mL) than RMS-milk samples (0.17 log cfu/mL). The presence of thermoresistant lactic acid bacteria was not increased in milk from farms using RMS. Nevertheless, taxonomic profiles of thermoresistant bacteria isolated were different between the 2 types of milk. More Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus spp. were identified in RMS-milk samples. Thermoresistant enterococci and streptococci could easily end up in cheese. Therefore, milk proteolytic activities of these isolates were tested. Neither Streptococcus spp. nor Enterococcus faecium isolates exhibited proteolytic activities, whereas 53% of E. faecalis showed some. Also, only 1 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus was detected. Survival of selected RMS-milk samples isolates (3 E. faecalis and 1 Streptococcus thermophilus) was evaluated during a model Cheddar cheese manufacture. Although those strains survived well, they did not modify the acidification curve of milk.

Our objective was to investigate whether these dysbiotic bacteria act as pathobionts of T. vaginalis infection by altering pathogenic capabilities of the parasite, particularly in regard to adhesion to vaginal substrates and viability of human ectocervical cells. Assays interrogated the performance of T. vaginalis adhesion to biofilm produced by vaginal dysbiotic bacteria and whether these bacteria were capable of altering the ability of the parasite to bind to mucins and cells. The binding activities of T. vaginalis were quantified by flow cytometry. Host cell viability and apoptosis, as affected by T. vaginalis with or without the bacteria, were also measured experimentally. An in vitro biofilm was shown to provide adhesion for T. vaginalis. The binding of parasites to mucins and cells was modulated by the vaginal dysbiotic bacteria. Parasite cytoadhesion was significantly increased by these bacteria. In addition, these bacteria enhanced the pathogenic effects of the parasite to host cells. Together, this study showed that dysbiotic bacteria accompanying T. vaginalis infection in the vagina function as pathobionts as they are capable of enhancing the pathogenic capabilities of this parasite.

Total fecal concentrations of BCFAs were found to correlate weakly with serum creatinine concentration (rho, 0.33; P = .05), blood urea nitrogen concentration (rho, 0.40; P = .01), and pCS concentration (rho, 0.35; P = .04).Fecal isovaleric acid concentrations were higher in CKD cats, particularly in late stage disease, compared to healthy geriatric cats. Fecal BCFA concentrations correlated with pCS and were higher in cats with muscle wasting, providing evidence for malassimilation of protein in CKD cats.© 2019 The Authors.

However, the tissue-specific factors controlling this dialogue remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that T cell responses to commensal colonization are associated with the development of organized cellular clusters within the skin epithelium. These organized lymphocyte clusters are surrounded by keratinocytes expressing a discrete program associated with antigen presentation and antimicrobial defense. Notably, IL-22-mediated keratinocyte-intrinsic MHC class II expression was required for the selective accumulation of commensal-induced IFN-γ, but not IL-17A-producing CD4 T cells within the skin. Taking these data together, this work uncovers an unexpected role for MHC class II expression by keratinocytes in the control of homeostatic type 1 responses to the .

The purpose of our study was to investigate the effects of omega-7-enriched Decaisnea insignis seed oil (DISO) on reducing TMAO formation to prevent the L-carnitine-induced hepatic damage in mice. Feeding of mice with 3% L-carnitine in drinking water clearly increased the serum and urinary levels of TMAO (p<0.05 vs Normal), whereas the serum and urinary TMAO formation was sharply reduced by DISO administration (p<0.05). Meanwhile, DISO resulted in strong inhibition against the elevation of hepatic injury markers (AST, ALT and ALP) activities and dyslipidemia (TC, TG, LDL-C and HDL-C), as well as liver inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α and TNF-β) release in L-carnitine-fed mice, respectively (p<0.05). As revealed by 16S rDNA gene sequencing, DISO significantly inhibited the L-carnitine-induced elevations in the abundance of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Erysipelotrichaceae, and the increases in the proportion of Lactobacillus and Akkermansia, revealing that DISO attenuated the L-carnitine-caused gut dysbiosis. These findings suggested that DISO could alleviate liver dysfunction in L-carnitine-fed mice, which might be due to the protection against TMAO formation by modulating the gut .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694714>Antibiotic therapy and outcome from immune-checkpoint inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI) therapy is governed by a complex interplay of tumor and host-related determinants. Epidemiological studies have highlighted that exposure to antibiotic therapy influences the probability of response to ICPI and predict for shorter patient survival across malignancies. Whilst a number of studies have reproducibly documented the detrimental effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics, the immune-biologic mechanisms underlying the association with outcome are poorly understood. Perturbation of the gut , an increasingly well-characterized factor capable of influencing ICPI-mediated immune reconstitution, has been indicated as a putative mechanism to explain the adverse effects attributed to antibiotic exposure in the context of ICPI therapy. Prospective studies are required to validate antibiotic-mediated gut perturbations as a mechanism of ICPI refractoriness and guide the development of strategies to overcome this barrier to an effective delivery of anti-cancer immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689143>The gut  is a major regulator of androgen metabolism in intestinal contents.</a></h1><p>Androgens exert important effects both in androgen-responsive tissues and in the intestinal tract. To determine the impact of the gut  (GM) on intestinal androgen metabolism, we measured unconjugated (free) and glucuronidated androgen levels in intestinal contents from the small intestine, with a low bacterial density, and from cecum and colon, with a high bacterial density. Using a specific, sensitive gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method, we detected high levels of glucuronidated testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in small intestinal content of mice of both sexes, while in the distal intestine, we observed remarkably high levels of free DHT, exceeding serum levels by more than 20-fold. Similarly, in young adult men, high levels of unconjugated DHT, more than 70-fold higher than in serum, were detected in feces. In contrast to mice with a normal GM composition, germ-free mice had high levels of glucuronidated T and DHT, but very low free DHT levels, in the distal intestine. These findings demonstrate that the GM is involved in intestinal metabolism and deglucuronidation of DHT and T, resulting in extremely high free levels of the most potent androgen, DHT, in the colonic content of young and healthy mice and men.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682994>Both gut  and cytokines act to atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice.</a></h1><p>Several studies have suggested a role for the gut microbiome and cytokines in atherosclerosis development, but combined analyses of the changes of the gut  and cytokines have not been explored previously.We treated ApoE-/- and wild-type mice with a high-fat diet for 12 weeks. The gut microbiome and cytokine composition were analyzed using 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing and RayBio Quantibody Arrays, respectively. GO and KEGG analysis were performed to rationalize the potential mechanisms involved in the process of atherosclerosis.Gut bacterial characteristics in ApoE-/- mice were clearly separated and 21 gut bacterial clades were detected by the LEfSe analysis showing significant differences during the development of atherosclerosis. The relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia, Bacteroidaceae, Bacteroides, and Akkermansia showed significant positive correlations with serum total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Additionally, the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae was positive with the level of HDL and the abundance of Rikenellaceae showed a negative relationship with the level of TG and LDL. Thirteen differentially expressed proteins were identified with P-value < 0.05. CXCL5, FGF2, and E-Selectin were significantly negatively associated with Akkermansia and Verrucomicrobia. Additionally, CXCL5 was significantly negatively correlated with Bacteroides and Bacteroidaceae. Three "cellular component" subcategories, 24 ″molecular function" subcategories, 752 ″biological process" subcategories and 29 statistically remarkable KEGG pathway categories were identified.Gut  changes of the mice having atherosclerosis and their relationship with the inflammatory status could be one of the major etiological mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2019.

The endocannabinoidome (eCBome) - a complex signaling system including the endocannabinoid system, approximately 50 receptors and metabolic enzymes, and more than 20 lipid mediators with important physiopathologic functions modulates gastrointestinal tract function and may mediate host cell-microbe communications there. Germ-free (GF) mice, which lack an intestinal microbiome and so differ drastically from conventionally reared (CR) mice, offer a unique opportunity to explore the eCBome in a microbe-free model and in the presence of a reintroduced functional gut microbiome through fecal microbiome transfer (FMT). We aimed to gain direct evidence for a link between the microbiome and eCBome systems by investigating eCBome alterations in the gut in GF mice before and after FMT. Basal eCBome gene expression and lipid profiles were measured in various segments of the intestine of GF and CR mice at juvenile and adult ages using targeted qPCR transcriptomics and LC-MS/MS lipidomics. GF mice exhibited age-dependent modifications in intestinal eCBome gene expression and lipid mediator levels. FMT from CR donor mice to age-matched GF male mice reversed several of these alterations, particularly in the ileum and jejunum, after only 1 week, demonstrating that the gut microbiome directly impacts the host eCBome and providing a cause-effect relationship between the presence or absence of intestinal microbes and eCBome signaling. These results open the way to new studies investigating the mechanisms through which intestinal microorganisms exploit eCBome signaling to exert some of their physiopathologic functions.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672864> and the social brain.</a></h1><p>Sociability can facilitate mutually beneficial outcomes such as division of labor, cooperative care, and increased immunity, but sociability can also promote negative outcomes, including aggression and coercion.

Previous studies have found a positive correlation between thymic atrophy and colitis severity. It was, therefore, worthwhile to investigate the effect of thymopentin (TP5), a synthetic pentapeptide corresponding to the active domain of the thymopoietin, on colitis.  Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice were treated with TP5 by subcutaneous injection. Body weight, colon length, colon weight, immune organ index, disease activity index (DAI) score, and the peripheral blood profile were examined. The immune cells of the spleen and colon were analyzed by flow cytometry. Histology was performed on isolated colon tissues for cytokine analysis. Bacterial DNA was extracted from mouse colonic feces to assess the intestinal . Intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs), HCT116, CT26, and splenocytes were cultured and treated with TP5.  TP5 treatment increased the body weight and colon length, decreased the DAI score, and restored colon architecture of colitic mice. TP5 also decreased the infiltration of immune cells and expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Importantly, the damaged thymus and compromised lymphocytes in peripheral blood were significantly restored by TP5. Also, the production of IL-22, both in innate and adaptive lymphoid cells, was triggered by TP5. Given the critical role of IL-22 in mucosal host defense, we tested the effect of TP5 on mucus barrier and gut  and found that the number of goblet cells and the level of Mucin-2 expression were restored, and the composition of the gut microbiome was normalized after TP5 treatment. The critical role of IL-22 in the protective effect of TP5 on colitis was further confirmed by administering the anti-IL-22 antibody (αIL-22), which completely abolished the effect of TP5. Furthermore, TP5 significantly increased the expression level of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γ (RORγt), a transcription factor for IL-22. Consistent with this, RORγt inhibitor abrogated the upregulation of IL-22 induced by TP5.  TP5 exerts a protective effect on DSS-induced colitis by triggering the production of IL-22 in both innate and adaptive lymphocytes. This study delineates TP5 as an immunomodulator that may be a potential drug for the treatment of UC.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684843>Effect of nutrition on neurodegenerative diseases. A systematic review.</a></h1><p>Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive functional loss of neurons in the brain, causing cognitive impairment and motoneuron disability. Although multifactorial interactions are evident, nutrition plays an essential role in the pathogenesis and evolution of these diseases. A systematic literature search was performed, and the prevalence of studies evaluated the effect of the Mediterranean diet (MeDiet), nutritional support, EPA and DHA, and vitamins on memory and cognition impairment. The data showed that malnutrition and low body mass index (BMI) is correlated with the higher development of dementia and mortality. MeDiet, nutritional support, and calorie-controlled diets play a protective effect against cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD) while malnutrition and insulin resistance represent significant risk factors. Malnutrition activates also the gut--brain axis dysfunction that exacerbate neurogenerative process. Omega-3 and -6, and the vitamins supplementation seem to be less effective in protecting neuron degeneration. Insulin activity is a prevalent factor contributing to brain health while malnutrition correlated with the higher development of dementia and mortality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687392>Preliminary Study on the Effect of  TL on Cecal Bacterial Community Structure of Broiler Chickens.</a></h1><p>Probiotics can promote the health and growth performance of animals through modulation of intestinal .

In this study, we investigated the effect of the probiotic strain  TL on the growth performance and cecum microflora composition in Cobb 500 broiler chickens. In total, 180 broilers were randomly divided into three groups-each group comprised 4 pens, and each pen contained 15 chickens. The three groups were fed either a control diet, or a diet supplemented with either the antibiotic chlortetracycline or  TL. Broilers were weighed, and cecum contents were collected on days 7, 14, 21, and 35, respectively. The broilers in both the antibiotic and probiotic groups exhibited significant weight gain compared with controls, exhibiting increases of 16.02% and 13.40%, respectively, after 35 days ( < 0.01). Similarly, the feed conversion ratio (FCR, 1-35 days) of broilers in the chlortetracycline and  TL groups was lower than that of the controls. HiSeq high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA of the cecal  was performed on days 7, 14, 21, and 35, respectively. The / ratio was higher in the chlortetracycline and  TL groups than in the control group on days 14, 21, and 35, and especially on day 21. The prevalence of genera , , , and  () was higher in the antibiotic and probiotic groups, while that of ,  (), and  was higher in the control group. In this study, the changes in the  of the probiotic group were similar to those in the antibiotic group.

This study investigated the effects of CYP on the intestinal  and gut defence barrier of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). Different groups of experimental fish were fed a normal control diet (NC), a low CYP diet (LYP) and a high CYP diet (HYP) for 8 weeks. After the feeding trial, the fish were assessed for intestinal enzyme activity, intestinal histology, immune-related gene expression, intestinal SCFAs and intestinal . Our results indicated that the intestinal integrity and antioxidant enzyme (CAT and SOD) activity in the common carp were enhanced following CYP supplementation. The mRNA levels of anti-inflammatory (TGF-β), tight binding protein (occludin and ZO-1) and pathway factor genes (TLR4 and NF-κB) were significantly upregulated in the HYP group (P＜0.05), which was accompanied by an increase in the level of pro-inflammatory IL-1β in the gut (P＜0.05). High-throughput sequencing revealed that Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes bacteria were most abundant in the microbial community in the gut of the common carp. The relative abundances of Bacteroides, Flavobacterium and Lactobacillus were increased, while the abundances of pathogenic microorganisms such as Enterobacteriaceae, Shewanella, Pseudomonas and Vibrio were reduced after treatment with CYP. Furthermore, the concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the gut were also increased (P＜0.05). Finally, our results revealed correlations between gut , SCFAs, non-specific immunity and antioxidant enzymes in CYP-fed carp. These results suggest that CYP-supplemented feed could improve the immunity of the common carp by modulating the intestinal microflora and enhancing the gut defence barrier and has the potential to be used as an immunostimulating feed additive in aquaculture.Copyright © 2019.

We sought to develop a three-dimensional gingivae-biofilm interface model using a commercially available gingival epithelium to study the tissue inflammatory response to oral biofilms associated with "health", "gingivitis" and "periodontitis". These biofilms were developed by sequential addition of microorganisms to mimic the formation of supra- and sub-gingival plaque in vivo. Secondly, to mimic the interactions between gingival epithelium and immune cells in vivo, we integrated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD14 monocytes into our three-dimensional model and were able to assess the inflammatory response in the immune cells cultured with and without gingival epithelium. We describe a differential inflammatory response in immune cells cultured with epithelial tissue, and more so following incubation with epithelium stimulated by "gingivitis-associated" biofilm. These results suggest that gingival epithelium-derived soluble mediators may control the inflammatory status of immune cells in vitro, and therefore targeting of the epithelial response may offer novel therapies.

Unfortunately, clinical trials aiming to detect predictive factors of disease, in individuals with a high risk of T1DM, reported negative results. Hence, actually there are no tools or strategies to prevent T1DM onset. The importance of the gut microbiome in autoimmune diseases is increasingly recognized and recent data suggest that intestinal dysbiosis has a pathogenic role in T1DM by affecting both intestinal immunostasis and the permeability of the gut barrier. An improved understanding of the mechanisms whereby dysbiosis in the gut favors T1DM development may help develop new intervention strategies to reduce both the incidence and burden of T1DM.

Due to the epidemic obesity, NAFLD is representing a global health issue and the leading cause of liver damage worldwide. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is closely related to insulin resistance (IR), adiposity and physical inactivity as well as genetic and epigenetic factors corroborate to the development and progression of hepatic steatosis and liver injury. Emerging evidence has outlined the implication of gut  and gut-derived endotoxins as actively contributors to NAFLD pathophysiology probably due to the tight anatomo-functional crosstalk between the gut and the liver. Obesity, nutrition and environmental factors might alter intestinal permeability producing a favorable micro-environment for bacterial overgrowth, mucosal inflammation and translocation of both invasive pathogens and harmful byproducts, which, in turn, influence hepatic fat composition and exacerbated pro-inflammatory and fibrotic processes. To date, no therapeutic interventions are available for NAFLD prevention and management, except for modifications in lifestyle, diet and physical exercise even though they show discouraging results due to the poor compliance of patients. The premise of this review is to discuss the role of gut-liver axis in NAFLD and emphasize the beneficial effects of probiotics on gut  composition as a novel attractive therapeutic strategy to introduce in clinical practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680713>Changes in stool frequency following chicory inulin consumption, and effects on stool consistency, quality of life and composition of gut .</a></h1><p>Inulin is a soluble dietary fibre, also classified as a prebiotic, extracted from chicory roots. The present study aimed to determine the effect of consumption of native chicory inulin on the stool frequency of middle-aged to older adults (40-75 years old) with uncomfortably but not clinically relevant low stool frequency, specified as two to four days without bowel movements per week. Two randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover trials were conducted using similar protocols in differing populations. Trial A was conducted in Amsterdam, The Netherlands and subsequently Trial B was conducted in Newcastle, United Kingdom. Both trials involved supplementation for 5 weeks with 10 g per day of inulin or placebo, a washout period of 2 weeks, and then crossed over to receive the other treatment. In Trial B, faecal gut  composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In Trial A, which 10 volunteers completed, the stool frequency was significantly increased to an average 4.9 ± 0.23 (SEM) times per week during inulin periods versus 3.6 ± 0.25 in the periods with placebo ( = 0.01). In contrast, in Trial B which 20 volunteers completed, there was no significant effect of the inulin on stool frequency (7.5 ± 2.1 times per week with inulin, 8.1 ± 3.0 with placebo,  = 0.35). However, many subjects in Trial B had a stool frequency >5 per week also for the placebo period, in breach of the inclusion criteria. Combining the data of 16 low stool frequency subjects from Trials A and B showed a significant effect of inulin to increase stool frequency from 4.1 to 5.0 per week ( = 0.032). Regarding secondary outcomes, stool consistency was significantly softer with inulin treatment compared to placebo periods, it increased 0.29 on the Bristol stool scale ( = 0.008) when data from all subjects of Trials A and B were combined. No other differences in bowel habit parameters due to inulin consumption were significant. None of the differences in specific bacterial abundance, alpha or beta diversity were significant, however the trends were in directions consistent with published studies on other types of inulin. We conclude that 10 g per day of native chicory inulin can increase stool frequency in subjects with low stool frequency.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681784>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)-A Textbook Case for Multi-Centric Banking of Human Biological Materials.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory condition affecting mainly the gastro-intestinal tract with two main entities: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Although the exact mechanisms underlying the initial development of IBD are not fully understood, it is believed that an abnormal immune response is elicited against the intestinal  in genetically predisposed individuals. Crucial elements of the etiopathogenesis have been elucidated by research using human biological materials. The estimated prevalence of IBD is 0.5% in the Western world. Although incidence rates are increasing, both conditions are not "common" in general terms mandating a multicentric approach. Biological material from numerous Belgian patients have been collected over time in a number of university hospitals in Belgium (UH Ghent: 800 CD patients, 350 UC patients, 600 normal controls; UH Leuven: 2,600 CD patients, 1,380 UC patients, 98 IC/IBDU patients, 6,260 normal controls). Within the setting of the Flemish Center Medical Innovation (CMI) initiative and later on the Flemish biobank network a prospective study was set-up across three Belgian IBD centers (University Hospitals Brussels, Ghent, and Leuven). Human biological materials and data have been collected prospectively from newly diagnosed CD and UC patients. The analyses hereof have generated new insights which have been published in the most renowned journals. The approach of well-thought off, multi-centric, structured, and systematic biobanking has proven to be a success-story and thus a textbook case for multi-centric banking of human biological materials.

Five bacterial species with the capacity to degrade polymers and/or produce acidic fermentation products detectable in human feces were used in the experiments. The bacteria showed preferential use of certain polysaccharides over others for growth, and this influenced their fermentation output qualitatively. These kinds of studies are essential in developing concepts of how the gut microbial community shares habitat resources, directly and indirectly, when presented with mixtures of polysaccharides that are found in human diets. The concepts are required in planning dietary interventions that might correct imbalances in the functioning of the human  so as to support measures to reduce metabolic conditions such as obesity.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675176>Emerging insights on the interaction between anticancer and immunosuppressant drugs and intestinal  in pediatric patients.</a></h1><p>Diseases affecting the immune system such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are pathological conditions affecting the pediatric population and are often associated with alterations in the intestinal , such as a decrease in bacterial diversity.

Any condition (environmental, pharmacological/toxicological, physical, or neuro-humoral) that changes the vascular endothelium has great consequences for the organism's wellness and on the outcome and evolution of severe cardiovascular pathologies. Thus, knowledge of the mechanisms, both endogenous and external, that affect endothelial dysfunction is pivotal to preventing and treating these disorders. In recent decades, significant attention has been focused on gut  and how these symbiotic microorganisms can influence host health and disease development. Indeed, dysbiosis has been reported to be at the base of a range of different pathologies, including pathologies of the cardiovascular system. The study of the mechanism underlying this relationship has led to the identification of a series of metabolites (released by gut bacteria) that exert different effects on all the components of the vascular system, and in particular on endothelial cells.

We investigate the potential changes of 5-FU treatment and the modulations of probiotics on gut  in a mouse model.Male BALB/c mice received either 5-FU or saline (S). They were separated and fed saline, Lactobacillus casei variety rhamnosus (Lcr) and Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 (BG). Lcr and BG were simultaneously administered with 5-FU for 5 days. Stool specimens were collected for DNA extraction and pyrosequenced for bio-informatic analysis.Fecal microbial communities were obviously diverse. Bacteroides and Bacteroidaceae were the most abundant  in FU.BG group while S24_7 was the most in S. S group. At phylum and class levels, abundances of Betaproteobacteria, Erysipelotrichi, Gammaproteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia were significantly increased in the FU groups. Probiotics supplementation did increase the abundances of Enterobacteriales and Turicibacterales. We demonstrated probiotics did modulate the abundance and diversity of gut . Bacterial motility proteins were found enriched and upregulated in the S.BG group. No mortality was noted. No bacterial translocation was found in spleen and blood among the 6 groups.Gut  of mice undergoing chemotherapy exhibited a distinct disruption in bacterial composition. Probiotic did modulate the abundance and diversity of gut . This is the first study to analyze the effects and safety of Lactobacillus strains on 5-FU-induced mucositis systematically and assess changes in the intestinal  after probiotic intervention.This article is protected by copyright.

Most methods for quantification of poly-P pools suffer from low accuracy and specificity. More powerful and implementable P-analysis tools are required for poly-P quantification, which will help in improved evaluation of processes in laboratory and full-scale EBPR systems. This study developed two methods to quantify poly-P pools by releasing the poly-P from the cell. During experimental optimization, it was observed that two different methods resulted in the highest phosphate release: acetate addition at a pH of 4.8 and exposure to EDTA solution with a concentration of 1% (w/v). Treatment with EDTA resulted in a higher amount of phosphate release from all sludge samples. This was characterized by P-release of 1.5-2.5 times higher than the control tests. In contrast, treatments with acetate addition at a low pH exhibited that P-release depended upon the types of the sludge samples. The highest P-release amount and rate were found in highly-enriched PAO sludge samples, but with fewer influences on the sludge collected from WWTP, which may be attributed to the lower fraction of PAOs in the sludge. Overall, the proposed approaches to quantify the poly-P concentration can be applied in simple, user-friendly, and cost-effective ways.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the prevalence of these bacteria in developing countries has not been extensively investigated. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the prevalence of cefotaxime-resistant commensal  harboring  among residents of a representative Vietnamese village and assessed the characteristics of these isolates.The stool samples, one stool sample per resident, of 612 residents were cultured on MacConkey agar with cefotaxime. Resulting -like colonies were isolated and examined further for the presence of colistin-resistant extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing  with . Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed, and clonal relationship among colistin-resistant isolates was assessed.Thirty-one of the 451 cefotaxime-resistant  isolates were resistant to colistin and the majority possessed  , and/or  , except for two isolates that produced the AmpC β-lactamase. All  ESBL-producing  isolates were multidrug-resistant (5-11 antibiotics). The isolates contained various plasmid replicon types, including the most prevalent types IncHI2 (54.8%), IncFIB (48.4%), and IncN (41.9%). In addition, 83.9% of the  ESBL- isolates possessed a transposon IS segment. Furthermore, 77.4% of the  ESBL- isolates belonged to phylogenetic group A. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis indicated limited clonal expansion of a specific strain.These results demonstrate the wide dissemination of colistin-resistant ESBL- harboring  among commensal bacteria of rural residents in Vietnam, suggesting possible mobilization of the  gene among ESBL-producing , which is a great public health concern.© 2019 Kawahara et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669832>Diet, , and Colorectal Cancer.</a></h1><p>The intestinal epithelium is a very dynamic tissue under a high regenerative pressure, which makes it susceptible to malignant transformation.

However, information on the metabolic dynamics that occur longitudinally through the colon is limited. Here, gas and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry were applied to generate metabolic profiles of the region-specific microbial communities cultured using an in vitro platform simulating the ascending (AC), transverse (TC), and descending (DC) colon regions. Comparative analysis revealed a large divergence between metabolic profiles of the AC to the TC and DC regions in terms of short chain fatty acid production, metabolic spectrum, and conversion of bile acids. Metagenomic evaluation revealed that the regionally derived metabolic profiles had strong correlation to community composition and genetic potential. Together, the results provide key insights regarding the metabolic divergence of the regional communities that are integral to understanding the structure-function relationship of the gut .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683780>High Betaine, a Trimethylamine N-Oxide Related Metabolite, Is Prospectively Associated with Low Future Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in the PREVEND Study.</a></h1><p>Gut -related metabolites, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), choline, and betaine, have been shown to be associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Moreover, lower plasma betaine concentrations have been reported in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, few studies have explored the association of betaine with incident T2DM, especially in the general population. The goals of this study were to evaluate the performance of a newly developed betaine assay and to prospectively explore the potential clinical associations of betaine and future risk of T2DM in a large population-based cohort.We developed a high-throughput, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy procedure for acquiring spectra that allow for the accurate quantification of plasma/serum betaine and TMAO. Assay performance for betaine quantification was assessed and Cox proportional hazards regression was employed to evaluate the association of betaine with incident T2DM in 4336 participants in the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND) study.Betaine assay results were linear (y = 1.02X - 3.75) over a wide range of concentrations (26.0-1135 µM). The limit of blank (LOB), limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were 6.4, 8.9, and 13.2 µM, respectively. Coefficients of variation for intra- and inter-assay precision ranged from 1.5-4.3% and 2.5-5.5%, respectively. Deming regression analysis of results produced by NMR and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry(LC-MS/MS) revealed an R value of 0.94 (Y = 1.08x - 1.89) and a small bias for higher values by NMR. The reference interval, in a cohort of apparently healthy adult participants ( = 501), was determined to be 23.8 to 74.7 µM (mean of 42.9 ± 12.6 µM). In the PREVEND study ( = 4336, excluding subjects with T2DM at baseline), higher betaine was associated with older age and lower body mass index, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and hsCRP. During a median follow-up of 7.3 (interquartile range (IQR), 5.9-7.7) years, 224 new T2DM cases were ascertained. Cox proportional hazards regression models revealed that the highest tertile of betaine was associated with a lower incidence of T2DM. Hazard ratio (HR) for the crude model was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.44-0.85,  = 0.004). The association remained significant even after adjusting for multiple clinical covariates and T2DM risk factors, including fasting glucose. HR for the fully-adjusted model was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.32-0.80,  = 0.003).The newly developed NMR-based betaine assay exhibits performance characteristics that are consistent with usage in the clinical laboratory. Betaine levels may be useful for assessing the risk of future T2DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681197> Induces Immune Enhancing and Shapes Gut  in Social Wasps.</a></h1><p>Trained immunity is the enhanced response of the innate immune system to a secondary infection after an initial encounter with a microorganism. This non-specific response to reinfection is a primitive form of adaptation that has been shown to be conserved from plants to mammals. Insects lack an acquired immune component and rely solely on an innate one, and they have expanded it upon traits of plasticity and adaptation against pathogens in the form of immune priming. The recent discoveries of the role of  in the insect's ecology and the ability of this yeast to induce trained immunity in different organisms suggest that insects could have developed mechanisms of adaptation and immune enhancing. Here, we report that two yeast strains of , previously shown to induce trained immunity in mammals, enhance resistance to  infection in the paper wasp . The reduction of injected  load by  strains was statistically significant in future foundresses but not in workers, and this occurs before and after hibernation. We thus investigated if the effect on  was mirrored by variation in the gut  composition. Foundresses, showing immune enhancing, had statistically significant changes in composition and diversity of gut bacterial communities but not in the fungal communities. Our results demonstrate that  can prime insect responses against bacterial infections, providing an advantage to future foundress wasps to carry these microorganisms. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the generation of specific and long-lasting immune response against pathogenic infections in insects and the influence of the induction of trained immunity on the commensal gut  could have a major impact on modern immunology.Copyright © 2019 Meriggi, Di Paola, Vitali, Rivero, Cappa, Turillazzi, Gori, Dapporto, Beani, Turillazzi and Cavalieri.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681624>Identification of Gut  and Metabolites Signature in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome.</a></h1><p> Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder. However, the underlying mechanism of IBS is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate potential mechanism and novel biomarkers of IBS through evaluation of the metabolomic and microbiologic profile.  Fecal samples were collected from 15 irritable bowel syndrome patients and 15 healthy controls. By using gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) and 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, fecal metabolites and  of healthy controls and the IBS patients were measured.  IBS patients had a significantly differential metabolite profile as compared to healthy controls, and 4 clusters with 31 metabolites, including a group of amino acids and fatty acids, were significantly up-regulated as compared to the healthy controls. In addition, 19 microbes were significantly up-regulated, and 12 microbes were down-regulated in the IBS group, when compared with the healthy controls. Some clusters of fecal metabolites or microorganisms were significantly correlated with the severity of IBS symptoms, such as the frequency of abdominal pain/discomfort and the number of bowel movements. Correlation of the metabolite levels with abundances of microbial genera showed some statistically significant metabolite-microbe associations. Four differentially abundant amino acids clustered together were positively correlated with some microbes, including , and so on.  The finding of this study puts a global perspective on metabolomics and  profiling in IBS patients and provides a theoretical basis for future research on pathophysiology of IBS.Copyright © 2019 Zhu, Liu, Li, Zhang, Zhang, Chen, Zhao, Chen, Gu, Min and Zhang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682463>Alterations in Oral  in HIV are Related to Decreased Pulmonary Function.</a></h1><p>Mechanisms of HIV-associated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are poorly understood. The oral microbiome shapes the lung microbiome and gut dysbiosis can impact lung diseases; however, relationships of the oral and gut microbiome to COPD in HIV have not been explored.To examine alterations in the oral and gut microbiome associated with pulmonary disease in persons with HIV (PWH).75 PWH and 93 HIV-uninfected men from the Multicenter AIDS cohort study performed pulmonary function testing. Sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA in saliva and stool was performed. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling, permutational multivariate analysis of variance and linear discriminant analysis to analyze communities by HIV and lung function.Oral microbiome composition differed by HIV and smoking status. Alterations of oral microbial communities were observed in PWH with abnormal lung function with increases in relative abundance of Veillonella, Streptococcus and Lactobacillus. There were no significant associations between the oral microbiome and lung function in HIV-uninfected individuals. No associations with HIV status or lung function were seen with the gut microbiome.Alterations of oral  in PWH were related to impaired pulmonary function and to systemic inflammation. These results suggest that the oral microbiome may serve as a biomarker of lung function in HIV and that its disruption may contribute to COPD pathogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680937>Neuroinflammation and the Gut : Possible Alternative Therapeutic Targets to Counteract Alzheimer's Disease?</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multi-factorial disease affecting various brain systems. This complexity implies that successful therapies must be directed against several core neuropathological targets rather than single ones. The scientific community has made great efforts to identify the right AD targets beside the historic amyloid-β (Aβ). Neuroinflammation is re-emerging as determinant in the neuropathological process of AD. A new theory, still in its infancy, highlights the role of gut  (GM) in the control of brain development, but also in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Bidirectional communication between the central and the enteric nervous systems, called gut-brain axes, is largely influenced by GM and the immune system is a potential key mediator of this interaction. Growing evidence points to the role of GM in the maturation and activation of host microglia and peripheral immune cells. Several recent studies have found abnormalities in GM (dysbiosis) in AD populations. These observations raise the intriguing question whether and how GM dysbiosis could contribute to AD development through action on the immune system and whether, in a therapeutic prospective, the development of strategies preserving a healthy GM might become a valuable approach to prevent AD. Here, we review the evidence from animal models and humans of the role of GM in neuroinflammation and AD.Copyright © 2019 Cerovic, Forloni and Balducci.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674054>Long-term impact of tylosin on fecal  and fecal bile acids of healthy dogs.</a></h1><p>Tylosin is commonly prescribed to dogs with diarrhea.

However, studies on the MiTBamp in MDD are lacking. The aim of the present study was to analyze the gut  composition and the MiTBamp in MDD patients.We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool samples from 26 MDD patients and 29 healthy controls (HCs). In addition to the  community and the MiTBamp analyses, we also built a classification based on the Random Forests (RF) and Boruta algorithm to identify the gut  as biomarkers for MDD.The Bacteroidetes abundance was strongly reduced whereas that of Actinobacteria was significantly increased in the MDD patients compared with the abundance in the HCs. Most noteworthy, the MDD patients had increased levels of Bifidobacterium, which is commonly used as a probiotic. Four Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologies (KOs) (K01817, K11358, K01626, K01667) abundances in the MiTBamp were significantly lower in the MDD group. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between the K01626 abundance and the HAMD scores in the MDD group. Finally, RF classification at the genus level can achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.890.The present findings enabled a better understanding of the changes in gut  and the related Trp pathway in MDD.

However, most of the microbial antigens targeted by gut IgA remain unknown, and the functional effects of IgA targeting these antigens are currently understudied. This study provides a framework for identifying and characterizing gut  antigens targeted by gut IgA. We developed a small intestinal  culture assay to harvest lamina propria IgA from gnotobiotic mice, with the aim of identifying antigenic targets in a model human gut commensal,  VPI-5482. Colonization by  induced a microbe-specific IgA response that was reactive against diverse antigens, including capsular polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides, and proteins. IgA against microbial protein antigens targeted membrane and secreted proteins with diverse functionalities, including an IgA specific against proteins of the polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL) that are necessary for utilization of fructan, which is an important dietary polysaccharide. Further analyses demonstrated that the presence of dietary fructan increased the production of fructan PUL-specific IgA, which then downregulated the expression of fructan PUL in , both  and  Since the expression of fructan PUL has been associated with the ability of  to colonize the gut in the presence of dietary fructans, our work suggests a novel role for gut IgA in regulating microbial colonization by modulating their metabolism. Given the significant impact that gut microbes have on our health, it is essential to identify key host and environmental factors that shape this diverse community. While many studies have highlighted the impact of diet on gut , little is known about how the host regulates this critical diet- interaction. In our present study, we discovered that gut IgA targeted a protein complex involved in the utilization of an important dietary polysaccharide: fructan. While the presence of dietary fructans was previously thought to allow unrestricted growth of fructan-utilizing bacteria, our work shows that gut IgA, by targeting proteins responsible for fructan utilization, provides the host with tools that can restrict the microbial utilization of such polysaccharides, thereby controlling their growth.Copyright © 2019 Joglekar et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681786>Plant-Based Fat, Dietary Patterns Rich in Vegetable Fat and Gut  Modulation.</a></h1><p>Diet is advocated as a key factor influencing gut .

We investigated if the dietary minerals interact with the gut  to alter circulating lipid profiles, implicated in CVD and metabolic syndrome.Plasma samples from Wistar rats fed a control or HNaLK diet with or without antibiotic treatment (n = 7 each, a total of 28) were subjected to lipidomics analysis. Lipidomic data were then analyzed using various statistical and bioinformatics tools, which detected numerous lipid species altered by the treatments, and consistently demonstrated interactions between the gut  and the HNaLK diet in altering circulating lipids, mainly triglycerides (TGs). We identified two distinct TG groups, differentially regulated by antibiotic treatment. One group (cluster 1), representing the majority of TG species detected, was downregulated, whereas the other group (cluster 2) was upregulated by antibiotic treatment. Interestingly, cluster 2 TGs were also regulated by the diet. Cluster 2 TGs exhibited greater carbon-chain length and double-bond content and included TGs composed of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, previously associated with reduced diabetes risk.The HNaLK diet interacts with gut bacteria to alter plasma lipid profiles, which may be related to its health effects.

Ten 30-day-old male yak calves were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The maternal grazing (MG) group was maternally nursed and grazed, and the early weaning (EW) group was supplied milk replacer, starter feed, and alfalfa hay twice per day. Compared with the yak calves in the MG group, the yak calves in the EW group showed significantly increased body weight, body height, body length, and chest girth. When suffering to the potential mechanism of improved growth of yak calves, except for the enhanced ruminal fermentation, the significantly increased total volatile fatty acids, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, and valerate in the caecum in the EW group could also serve to promote the growth of calves. By using 16S rDNA sequencing, some significantly increased caecal phylum and genera, which were all related to the enhanced caecal fermentation by utilizing both the fibrous and non-fibrous carbohydrates, were identified in the EW group. In conclusion, early weaning of yak calves by supplying them with alfalfa hay, starter feed, and milk replacer is more beneficial to the growth of yak calves when compared with maternal grazing and nursing, in part due to alterations in caecal  and fermentation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678900>Bile acid abnormality induced by intestinal dysbiosis might explain lipid metabolism in Parkinson's disease.</a></h1><p>Intestinal dysbiosis refers to an imbalance in the intestinal flora. The concept of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), a condition of abnormal proliferation of the small intestine , has been proposed as a form of small intestine dysbiosis. In Parkinson's disease patients, weight loss and metabolic disorders such as lipid abnormalities are frequently encountered. This was a prospective investigation of the presence of SIBO using the lactulose breath test, Parkinson's disease symptoms, medications, abdominal symptoms, and blood data involving 39 Parkinson's disease patients. Of the 39 patients, 19 were positive for SIBO, 16 were negative, and 4 were equivocal. SIBO-positive patients had a significantly smaller dopaminergic drug load (dopamine replacement of Parkinson's disease drug potency) (P = 0.009) and significantly lower serum triglyceride (TG) (P = 0.024) and total bilirubin (P = 0.019) levels. No relationship was seen between the presence or absence of SIBO and motor or abdominal symptoms. The following hypothesis was developed with regard to the possibility that intestinal bacterial overgrowth has various effects that are exhibited via bile acid metabolism in Parkinson's disease patients. Serum bilirubin levels become higher as bilirubin metabolism declines with decreases in the intestinal bacteria. At the same time, bile acid is broken down due to increased intestinal bacteria, and lipid absorption decreases. This induces low serum TG levels and leads to weight loss. By a similar mechanism, there is less absorption of vitamin D as bile acid levels decrease, leading to osteoporosis and fractures. The possibility that some of the non-motor manifestations accompanying Parkinson's disease are caused by intestinal dysbiosis needs to be considered.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Meconium samples could be divided into three distinct types that were not influenced by the delivery method.The distribution patterns of bacterial communities in the meconium, placenta, and foetal membranes were highly similar and had nothing to do with the mode of delivery. For approximately half of the placental microorganisms, the same sequence could be found in the vaginal, rectal, and oral samples of the mother.Copyright © 2019.

Milk bacteria appear to, amongst others, originate from the maternal gut. A mother's postnatal psychosocial distress may alter maternal gut , which in turn may affect the bacteria present in milk. The aim of this study was to explore whether maternal postnatal psychosocial distress was related to alterations in the relative abundances of specific bacteria and to milk microbial diversity. Healthy mothers ( = 77;  = 51 with complete data) collected breast milk samples at 2, 6, and 12 weeks postpartum and filled in mood questionnaires on experienced stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum. A metataxonomic approach (16S rRNA gene sequencing (region V3 and V4) using Illumina MiSeq technology) was used to assess bacterial abundances and diversity. For the group as a whole, an increase in diversity of the milk bacterial community was observed during the first 3 months of breastfeeding (Shannon index). This general increase in diversity appears to be explained by an increase of  and other minor genera, together with a decrease in . With respect to psychological distress and milk microbial composition, no significant differences in the relative abundance of major bacterial genera were detected between women with high ( = 13) and low ( = 13) psychosocial distress. However, progressive and distinct changes in the content of , , and  at the phylum level and , , and  at the genera level were observed in milk samples of women with low psychosocial distress. With respect to milk microbial diversity, high maternal psychosocial distress, compared to low maternal psychosocial distress, was related to significantly lower bacterial diversity in milk at 3 months post-delivery. Anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms separately were unrelated to specific bacterial profiles. The current study suggests a potential relation between maternal psychosocial distress and milk , providing first evidence of a possible mechanism through which post-partum psychological symptoms may affect infant development and health.Copyright © 2019 Browne, Aparicio, Alba, Hechler, Beijers, Rodríguez, Fernández and de Weerth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697309>Illuminating the dynamic rare biosphere of the Greenland Ice Sheet's Dark Zone.</a></h1><p>Greenland's Dark Zone is the largest contiguous region of bare terrestrial ice in the Northern Hemisphere and microbial processes play an important role in driving its darkening and thereby amplifying melt and runoff from the ice sheet. However, the dynamics of these  have not been fully identified. Here we present joint 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA (cDNA) comparison of input (snow), storage (cryoconite), and output (supraglacial stream water) habitats across the Dark Zone over the melt season. We reveal that all three Dark Zone communities have a preponderance of rare taxa exhibiting high protein synthesis potential (PSP). Furthermore, taxa with high PSP represent highly connected 'bottlenecks' within community structure, consistent with their roles as metabolic hubs. Finally, low abundance-high PSP taxa affiliated with Methylobacterium within snow and stream water suggest a novel role for Methylobacterium in the carbon cycle of Greenlandic snowpacks, and importantly, the export of potentially active methylotrophs to the bed of the Greenland Ice Sheet. By comparing the dynamics of bulk and potentially active  in the Dark Zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet we provide novel insights into the mechanisms and impacts of the microbial colonization of this critical region of our melting planet.© FEMS 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677982>Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes levels in gut  and effects of hosts TLR2/TLR4 gene expression levels in adult type 1 diabetes patients in Istanbul, Turkey.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to determine and compare the levels of both Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in the gut  and TLR2/TLR4 gene expression in the blood of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and healthy individuals. These results may serve as a preliminary assessment to guide future research.Between January and October 2014, stool and blood samples were collected from 53 adult T1DM patients and 53 age- and gender-matched healthy individuals. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes levels were assessed from stool sample DNA and TLR2 and TLR4 expression levels were analyzed via qPCR using RNA from EDTA blood samples from both patients and healthy controls.The amounts of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were statistically significantly higher and lower, respectively, in the T1DM group than in the healthy control group (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). In addition, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratios in patients with T1DM were significantly lower than in healthy controls. The TLR4 and TLR2 gene expression levels in T1DM patients were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively, compared to those in the control group.Our data are the first to show a relationship between T1DM and gut  in our country. In addition, our results provide information about the connections between T1DM, gut , and TLR2 and TLR4 expression. We believe that Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in the gut  may play a role in the autoimmune process of T1DM and that these findings should be further investigated in the future.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

While the diversity of phages in gut ecosystems is getting increasingly well characterized, knowledge is limited how phages contribute to the evolution and ecology of their host bacteria. Here, we show that biologically active prophages are widely distributed in phylogenetically diverse strains of the gut symbiont  Nearly all human- and rodent-derived strains, but less than half of the tested strains of porcine origin, contain active prophages, suggesting different roles of phages in the evolution of host-specific lineages. To gain insight into the ecological role of  phages, we developed strain  6475 as a model to study its phages. After administration to mice,  6475 produces active phages throughout the entire intestinal tract, with the highest number detected in the distal colon. Inactivation of  abolished  phage production, which suggests that activation of the SOS response drives phage production in the gut. In conventional mice, phage production reduces bacterial fitness as fewer wild-type bacteria survive gut transit compared to the mutant lacking prophages. However, in gnotobiotic mice, phage production provides  with a competitive advantage over a sensitive host. Collectively, we uncovered that the presence of prophages, although being associated with a fitness trade-off, can be advantageous for a gut symbiont by killing a competitor strain in its intestinal niche. Bacteriophages derived from lysogens are abundant in gut microbiomes. Currently, mechanistic knowledge is lacking on the ecological ramifications of prophage carriage yet essential to explain the abundance of lysogens in the gut. An extensive screen in the bacterial gut symbiont  revealed that biologically active prophages are widely distributed in this species. In strain  6475, phages are produced throughout the intestinal tract but phage production is associated with reduced fitness of the lysogen. However, phage production provides a competitive advantage in direct competition with a non-lysogenic strain of  that is sensitive to these phages. This combination of increased competition with a fitness trade-off provides a potential explanation for the domination of lysogens in gut ecosystem and how lysogens can co-exist with sensitive hosts.Copyright © 2019 Oh et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691208>Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 Ameliorated Visceral Hypersensitivity in Rats Through the Gut-Brain Axis.</a></h1><p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and alterations in bowel habits. Current treatments for IBS are unsatisfactory due to its multifactorial pathogenesis involving the -gut-brain axis. Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 (PS128) was reported to exhibit neuromodulatory activity which may be beneficial for improving IBS. This study aimed to investigate the effect of PS128 on visceral hypersensitivity (VH) and the gut-brain axis using a 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)-induced VH rat model without colonic inflammation induction, mimicking the characteristics of IBS. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered with PS128 (10 CFU in 0.2 mL saline/rat/day) or saline (0.2 mL saline/rat/day) for 14 days. Colorectal distension (CRD) with simultaneous electromyography recording was performed 30 min before and 30 min after the 5-HTP injection. Levels of neuropeptides and neurotrophins were analyzed. PS128 significantly reduced VH induced by the 5-HTP injection and CRD. Neurotransmitter protein levels, substance P, CGRP, BDNF, and NGF, were decreased in the dorsal root ganglion but increased in the spinal cord in response to the 5-HTP injection; PS128 reversed these changes. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was modulated by PS128 with decreased corticosterone concentration in serum and the expression of mineralocorticoid receptors in the amygdala. Oral administration of PS128 inhibited 5-HTP-induced VH during CRD. The ameliorative effect on VH suggests the potential application of PS128 for IBS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685533>Flexible cobamide metabolism in  ( 630 Δ.</a></h1><p> is an opportunistic pathogen known for its ability to colonize the human gut under conditions of dysbiosis.

To address the importance of cobamides to , we studied  630 Δ and mutant derivatives under cobamide-dependent conditions  Our results show that  can use a surprisingly diverse array of cobamides for methionine and deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, and can use alternative metabolites or enzymes, respectively, to bypass these cobamide-dependent processes.  630 Δ produces the cobamide pseudocobalamin when provided the early precursor 5-aminolevulinc acid or the late intermediate cobinamide, and produces other cobamides if provided an alternative lower ligand. The ability of  630 Δ to take up cobamides and Cbi at micromolar or lower concentrations requires the transporter BtuFCD. Genomic analysis revealed genetic variations in in the  locus of different  strains, which may result in differences in the ability to take up cobamides and Cbi. These results together demonstrate that, like other aspects of its physiology, cobamide metabolism in  is versatile. The ability of the opportunistic pathogen  to cause disease is closely linked to its propensity to adapt to conditions created by dysbiosis of the human gut . The cobamide (vitamin B) metabolism of  has been underexplored, though it has seven metabolic pathways that are predicted to require cobamide-dependent enzymes.

Here, we characterized the gut  of the  species complex from Central America (known as the Midas cichlid complex), encompassing 158 wild specimens (13 species) collected from seven Nicaraguan lakes, and combined these data with previously published data from two African lakes (spanning 29 species). Our aim was to comprehensively explore trends in  variation and persistence along the large spatial and temporal scales of cichlid diversification (from the oldest radiation in L. Tanganyika, 9-12 My old, to young ones in Nicaraguan crater lakes, <0.5 My old), in allopatry and sympatry (within and across lakes), and across the range of dietary niches (from highly specialized to generalist feeders). Despite their extraordinary diversity, cichlids shared a remarkably conserved microbial taxonomic profile, which argues for a primary role of the host genetics in the assembly and maintenance of these microbial communities. Within this partly constrained  profile, geographic isolation (continent and lake) represented the first level of discrimination. For the Midas cichlid, a partial congruency was found between host  and genetic distances, suggesting that microbial communities have partly diversified along their cichlid phylogeographic history of crater lake colonization. In sympatry (within lakes), the young and poorly ecologically diversified cichlid assemblages of Central American lakes display largely unresolved gut microbiotas (in terms of both alpha and beta diversities), whereas the phylogenetically and ecologically diverse species found in African lakes showed greater microbial interspecific diversity. This pattern largely points to the level of habitat segregation, trophic niche overlap, and reproductive barriers as major modulators of the gut  connectivity among sympatric species.Copyright © 2019 Baldo, Riera, Salzburger and Barluenga.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685095>Oropharyngeal Microbiome in Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Decreased Diversity and Abundance.</a></h1><p>To explore and analyze diversity and abundance of oropharyngeal  in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).This was a cross-sectional study. Middle-aged men, suspected to have OSA, referred to full-night polysomnography, and willing to provide oropharyngeal swab samples, were consecutively enrolled. OSA severity was assessed by apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) as non-OSA (AHI < 5 events/h) and OSA (AHI ≥ 15 events/h). Bacterial DNA of oropharyngeal samples was extracted and quality test performed. Oropharyngeal  was analyzed using 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis carried out after sequencing.Samples from 51 men (25 in the non-OSA group and 26 in the OSA group) were sent for examination. Of these, 40 samples were found to have sufficient concentration of DNA and were analyzed for bioinformatics. In alpha diversity analysis, the OSA group exhibited significantly lower sobs (198.33 ± 21.71 versus 216.57 ± 26.21, P = .022), chao (221.30 ± 26.62 versus 243.86 ± 26.20, P = .014), ace (222.17 ± 27.15 versus 242.42 ± 25.81, P = .028) and shannon index (3.14 ± 0.23 versus 3.31 ± 0.26, P = .035), suggesting a reduction in microbial species diversity. We further divided participants into non-OSA, moderate OSA, and severe OSA groups and observed a significant decrease in the bacterial biodiversity of OSA groups compared with the non-OSA group, with the most significant decrease occurring in the moderate OSA group. Principal coordinate analysis showed two extremely different oropharyngeal microbial communities in non-OSA and OSA groups. More interestingly, proportion of Neisseria was slightly higher in the severe OSA group (20.64%), followed by the moderate OSA and non-OSA groups (12.57% and 9.69%, respectively). Glaciecola was not detected in the OSA groups compared to the non-OSA group (0 versus 0.772 ± 0.4754, P < .001).Middle-aged men with OSA showed less oropharyngeal species diversity and altered abundance, on which further confirmation is warranted.© 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678050>The Role of the Gut Microbiome in Colorectal Cancer: Where Are We?

Theabrownin is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea. Here, we show that theabrownin alters the gut  in mice and humans, predominantly suppressing microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Theabrownin increases the levels of ileal conjugated bile acids (BAs) which, in turn, inhibit the intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling pathway, resulting in increased hepatic production and fecal excretion of BAs, reduced hepatic cholesterol, and decreased lipogenesis. The inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling is accompanied by increased gene expression of enzymes in the alternative BA synthetic pathway, production of hepatic chenodeoxycholic acid, activation of hepatic FXR, and hepatic lipolysis. Our results shed light into the mechanisms behind the cholesterol- and lipid-lowering effects of Pu-erh tea, and suggest that decreased intestinal BSH microbes and/or decreased FXR-FGF15 signaling may be potential anti-hypercholesterolemia and anti-hyperlipidemia therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681193>The Effect of  on Gut , Immune Response and Intestinal Barrier Function During the Development of Necrotic Enteritis in Chickens.</a></h1><p>Necrotic enteritis (NE) causes huge economic losses to the poultry industry.

However, whether or not it exerts a beneficial effect on NE in chickens remains elusive. Therefore, we investigated the impact of  on immune response and intestinal  during the development of NE in chickens, including experimental stages with basal diets, high-fishmeal-supplementation diets, and  challenge. Chickens were divided into two groups from day 1 to day 20: one group had its diet supplemented with  supplementation and one did not. At day 20, the chickens were divided into four groups:  challenged and unchallenged chickens with and without  supplementation. All groups were fed a basal diet for 13 days and thereafter a basal diet with 50% fishmeal from day 14 to 24. Chickens were infected with  from day 21 to 23. At days 13, 20 and 24, samples were collected for analysis of the relative expression of immune response and intestinal mucosa barrier-related genes and intestinal microbes. The results show that  can inhibit the increase in IL-17A gene expression and the reduction in Claudin-1 gene induced-expression caused by  challenge. Moreover,  was found to increase the expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 in infected chickens. Although  was found to have a significant beneficial effect on the structure of intestinal bacteria in the basal diet groups and decrease the abundance of  in the gut, it did not significantly affect the occurrence of intestinal lesions and did not significantly correct the shift in gut bacterial composition post  infection. In conclusion, although  promotes the expression of anti-inflammatory and tight junction protein genes and inhibits pro-inflammatory genes in challenged chickens, it is not adequate to improve the structure of intestinal  in NE chickens. Therefore, more effective schemes of  supplementation to prevent and treat NE in chickens need to be identified.Copyright © 2019 Huang, Peng, Gao, Wei, Xiang, Yuan and Xu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685450>Gut microbiome and adaptive immunity in schizophrenia.</a></h1><p>Over the past few years, immunopathogenesis has emerged as one of the most compelling aetiopathological models of schizophrenia (SCZ), suggesting a chronic, immune-based, low-grade inflammatory background of this devastating disorder.1,2 Mounting evidence points towards a prominent role of the adaptive immune system in SCZ, suggesting alterations in defense mechanisms, such as altered T-cell function and a shift towards B-cell immunity.3 Immune cells have the ability to infiltrate the brain and mediate a neuroimmune cross-talk through activation of microglia, production of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, leading to neuroinflammation, as mediator of neuroprogressive and neurodegenerative changes in SCZ.4 Antipsychotic drugs, commonly used to treat SCZ, are also known to affect the adaptive immune system, interfering with the differentiation and function of immune cells, towards their normalization in response to treatment. Adaptive immunity is principally founded on T-cell and B-cell populations, but also includes the host microbiome. The gastrointestinal  is a complex ecosystem with a great organism diversity and refined genomic structure that resides in the intestinal tract and has a central position in human health and disease.5 Neuroimmune dysregulation, relying of the highly sensitive and fine-tuned equilibrium between microbiome and adaptive immunity, can tip the scales towards neuroinflammation and disruption of higher-order brain networks.4,6,7 During the last decade, the human microbiome and the -gut-brain (MGB)-axis have become a novel epicentre in mental health research as a potentially vital new determinant in the field of neuroimmunoregulation, brain development, emotions, cognition and behaviour.7 The MGB-axis represents a bidirectional, key communication pathway between the immune system and the brain, thus partly also mediating the regulation of cognitive and emotional processing. An imbalanced human microbiome might greatly influence proper neuroimmune reactions and neurodevelopment with long-lasting effects and could thus play a pivotal role in the susceptibility and aetiology of psychiatric illness. Recent research offers first evidence that patients with SCZ show marked disturbances of gut bacterial taxa composition with a decreased microbiome diversity index, party associated with specific SCZ phenotype, symptom severity and treatment response.8,9 As the elegant education of the adaptive immune compartment depends on the colonization niche, antigen type and metabolic property of different gut microbes, T-cell differentiation as well as a continuous diversification of B-cell repertoire is expressed through microbiome-related, antigen-specific receptors that define a unique clonotype.10 However, there is only sparse evidence on the precise role of the microbiome on the programming of T- and B-cells in the underlying neurobiological pathways of SCZ and even less findings on the association of molecular T- and B-cell receptor repertoire signature and microbiome clonal landscape with specific phenotypical features of the disease.11 The latest conceptual advances in immunology urge an integrative re-evaluation of previous immunological findings in SCZ through modern approaches. High-throughput, next-generation sequencing (NGS) represents a powerful singlecell transcriptomic tool to profile the whole clonal landscape of T and B cells and human microbiome. NGS thus offers a unique opportunity for in-depth characterization of cellular and molecular signatures of adaptive immune receptor repertoires and microbiome taxonomy in SCZ and investigation of their intersection as a relevant pathway of disease progression and phenotype differentiation. SCZ patients are likely to show a diverging host-microbiome immune homeostasis with disease-specific clonotypes of adaptive immune receptor repertoires associated with altered microbiome taxonomy and molecular signature differences, which, in turn, may be related to distinct symptomatic phenotypes and neurocognitive patterns. Such sophisticated immuno-bioinformatic analyses may transform our understanding of SCZ by identification of novel neuroimmune pathways, offering us clinically accessible symptomatic and diagnostic biomarkers important for personalized medicine implications.12 An increased understanding and better characterization of immuno-phenotypes in SCZ will better guide the development of novel immune-based treatments in this severe disease and pave the way for possible prevention options through implementation of antibody engineering, vaccine design, and cellular immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695125>Publisher Correction: Effect of endogenous  on the molecular composition of cloud water: a study by Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS).</a></h1><p>An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670354>Whole barley prevents obesity and dyslipidemia without the involvement of the gut  in germ free C57BL/6J obese mice.</a></h1><p>Whole barley (WB) consumption is the subject of renewed interest because of its health benefits. However, there are still controversies regarding the mechanisms of the anti-obesity effects of WB. The gut  has recently become a focus of research into obesity-related disorders. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of the gut  to the anti-obesity effects of WB. Germ-free (GF) C57BL/6J mice underwent gastric inoculation with human feces to obtain human flora-associated (HFA) mice, and then both the GF and HFA mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) containing 46% WB or refined barley for 9 weeks. Features of obesity and dyslipidemia were compared between the GF and HFA mice and the cecal  was analyzed using next-generation sequencing of microbial 16S rRNA. WB prevents obesity and hypercholesterolemia in the GF and HFA mice. The mechanism may include the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, because sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA) expression was downregulated, and a reduction in cholesterol accumulation, because cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) expression was upregulated, independent of the gut . Furthermore, WB intake enriched a variety of bacterial genera that are negatively associated with obesity, including Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Clostridium cluster XIVa, suggesting that WB counteracted gut dysbiosis in obese mice. Thus, WB helps prevent obesity and dyslipidemia via both gut -dependent and independent mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675589>Effects of cadmium on intestinal histology and  in freshwater crayfish (Procambarus clarkii).</a></h1><p>In this study, Procambarus clarkii (P. clarkii) were exposed to different concentrations (0, 2, 5 and 10 mg/L) of cadmium (Cd).

We aimed to identify potential intestinal microbial pattern in IBS-D patients with SIBO.Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients fulfilling Rome III criteria were recruited and randomly divided into an exploratory cohort (57 cases) and a validation cohort (20 cases). SIBO was identified according to standard glucose hydrogen breath test. For 16S rRNA gene sequencing, samples of duodenal mucosa, duodenal fluid, rectal mucosa, and fresh feces were collected and performed. The α and β diversity, as well as differences in microbial composition and function, in SIBO and SIBO IBS-D subjects were evaluated.The microbial diversity and composition obviously differed between SIBO and SIBO IBS-D in duodenal and rectal mucosa but not in duodenal fluid and fresh feces. For rectal mucosal , it displayed markedly reduced aerobe and Gram-negative bacteria and increased facultative anaerobe and Gram-positive bacteria, moreover, altered functions of microbial metabolism in SIBO IBS-D. Significantly higher rectal mucosa-related microbial dysbiosis index was observed in SIBO IBS-D, and a cut-off value at -0.37 had a sensitivity of 56.55% and specificity of 90.91% to identify the SIBO in IBS-D subjects.Mucosal , rather than luminal bacteria, has a more apparent dysbiosis in SIBO IBS-D patients relative to those without SIBO. Rectal mucosa-associated  may act as a potential predictor of SIBO in IBS-D patients.© 2019 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672153>Effect of Enterococcus faecalis 2001 on colitis and depressive-like behavior in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice: involvement of the brain-gut axis.</a></h1><p>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including those with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, have higher rates of psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety; however, the mechanism of psychiatric disorder development remains unclear. Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut  is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest a close relationship between IBD and depression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31688969>Physiology of the Incretin Hormones, GIP and GLP-1-Regulation of Release and Posttranslational Modifications.</a></h1><p>The focus of this article is on the analysis of the release and postrelease fate of the incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide. Their actions are dealt with to the extent that they are linked to their secretion. For both hormones, their posttranslational processing is analyzed in detail, because of its importance for the understanding of the molecular heterogeneity of the hormones. Methods of analysis, in particular regarding measurements in plasma from in vivo experiments, are discussed in detail in relation to the molecular heterogeneity of the hormones, and the importance of the designations "total" versus "intact hormones" is explained. Both hormones are substrates for the ubiquitous enzyme, dipeptidyl peptidase-4, which inactivates the peptides with dramatic consequences for their physiological spectrum of activities. The role of endogenous and exogenous antagonists of the receptors is discussed in detail because of their importance for the elucidation of the physiology and pathophysiology of the hormones. Regarding the actual secretion, the most important factors are discussed, including gastric emptying rate and the influence of the different macronutrients. Additional factors discussed are the role of bile, paracrine regulation, the role of the , pharmaceuticals, and exercise. Finally, the secretion during pathological conditions is discussed. © 2019 American Physiological Society. Compr Physiol 9:1339-1381, 2019.Copyright © 2019 American Physiological Society.

While the absorption and metabolism of (poly)phenols has been described, it is not clear how their metabolic fate is affected under pathological conditions. This study evaluated the metabolic fate of berry (poly)phenols in an in vivo model of hypertension as well as the associated  response. Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed either a low-salt diet (0.26% NaCl) or a high-salt diet (8% NaCl), with or without a berry mixture (blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, Portuguese crowberry and strawberry tree fruit) for 9 weeks. The salt-enriched diet promoted an increase in the urinary excretion of berry (poly)phenol metabolites, while the abundance of these metabolites decreased in faeces, as revealed by UPLC-MS/MS. Moreover, salt and berries modulated gut  composition as demonstrated by 16S rRNA analysis. Some changes in the  composition were associated with the high-salt diet and revealed an expansion of the families  and . However, this effect was mitigated by the dietary supplementation with berries. Alterations in the metabolic fate of (poly)phenols occur in parallel with the modulation of gut  in hypertensive rats. Thus, beneficial effects of (poly)phenols could be related with these interlinked modifications, between metabolites and  environments.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685531>Developmental and cellular age direct conversion of CD4 T cells into RORγ or Helios colon Treg cells.</a></h1><p>RORγ and Helios Treg cells in the colon are phenotypically and functionally distinct, but their origins and relationships are poorly understood. In monocolonized and normal mice, single-cell RNA-seq revealed sharing of TCR clonotypes between these Treg cell populations, potentially denoting a common progenitor. In a polyclonal Treg cell replacement system, naive conventional CD4 (Tconv) cells, but not pre-existing tTregs, could differentiate into RORγ pTregs upon interaction with gut . A smaller proportion of Tconv cells converted into Helios pTreg cells, but these dominated when the Tconv cells originated from preweaning mice. T cells from infant mice were predominantly immature, insensitive to RORγ-inducing bacterial cues and to IL6, and showed evidence of higher TCR-transmitted signals, which are also characteristics of recent thymic emigrants (RTEs). Correspondingly, transfer of adult RTEs or Nur77 Tconv cells mainly yielded Helios pTreg cells, recapitulating the infant/adult difference. Thus, CD4 Tconv cells can differentiate into both RORγ and Helios pTreg cells, providing a physiological adaptation of colonic Treg cells as a function of the age of the cell or of the individual.© 2019 Pratama et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681025>Corrigendum: Physiological and Biochemical Effects of Intrinsically High and Low Exercise Capacities Through Multiomics Approaches.</a></h1><p>[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2019.01201.].Copyright © 2019 Tung, Hsu, Liao, Ho, Huang and Huang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695050>Comparison of oral microbiome profiles in stimulated and unstimulated saliva, tongue, and mouth-rinsed water.</a></h1><p>Epidemiological studies using saliva have revealed relationships between the oral microbiome and many oral and systemic diseases. However, when collecting from a large number of participants such as a large-scale cohort study, the time it takes to collect saliva can be a problem. Mouth-rinsed water, which is water that has been used to rinse the oral cavity, can be used as an alternative method for collecting saliva for oral microbiome analysis because it can be collected in a shorter time than saliva. The purpose of this study was to verify whether mouth-rinsed water is a suitable saliva substitute for analyzing the oral microbiome. We collected samples of mouth-rinsed water, stimulated saliva, unstimulated saliva, and tongue coating from 10 systemic healthy participants, and compared the microbial diversity and composition of the samples using next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA-encoding genes. The results showed that the microbial diversity of mouth-rinsed water was similar to that of unstimulated and stimulated saliva, and significantly higher than that of tongue-coating samples. The microbial composition at the species level of mouth-rinsed water also showed a very high correlation with the composition of unstimulated and stimulated saliva. These results suggest that the mouth-rinsed water is a suitable collection method instead of saliva for oral microbiome analysis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692924>Effect of poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) as natural polymers on mesenchymal stem cells.</a></h1><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are stromal multipotent stem cells that can differentiate into multiple cell types, including fibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and myoblasts, thus allowing them to contribute to the regeneration of various tissues, especially bone tissue. MSCs are now considered one of the most promising cell types in the field of tissue engineering. Traditional petri dish-based culture of MSCs generate heterogeneity, which leads to inconsistent efficacy of MSC applications. Biodegradable and biocompatible polymers, poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) (PHAs), are actively used for the manufacture of scaffolds that serve as carriers for MSC growth. The growth and differentiation of MSCs grown on PHA scaffolds depend on the physicochemical properties of the polymers, the 3D and surface microstructure of the scaffolds, and the biological activity of PHAs, which was discovered in a series of investigations. The mechanisms of the biological activity of PHAs in relation to MSCs remain insufficiently studied. We suggest that this effect on MSCs could be associated with the natural properties of bacteria-derived PHAs, especially the most widespread representative poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB). This biopolymer is present in the bacteria of mammalian , whereas endogenous poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) is found in mammalian tissues. The possible association of PHA effects on MSCs with various biological functions of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) in bacteria and eukaryotes, including in humans, is discussed in this paper.©The Author(s) 2019.

It has been reported that phloretin has anti-inflammatory effects in ulcerative colitis (UC) mice. However, the role of the gut  in the phloretin anti-UC process remains unclear. In this study, we observed that the anti-UC effect of phloretin was affected by co-housing, probably because of the transmissible nature of the gut micobiota. Through fecal micobiota transplantation (FMT), the effects of the gut  on the anti-UC of phloretin were further confirmed. UC was induced in mice by administrating 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for 7 days. Phloretin (60 mg/kg) was administered by gavage every day during the experiment. Fecal microbes (10 CFU/mL) from phloretin-treated UC mice were administered by gavage to non-phloretin-treated UC mice for 7 days. The results showed that FMT, like phloretin, ameliorated UC by improving disease symptoms and colon inflammation, balancing inflammatory cytokines, maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, restoring systemic immune function, inhibiting NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and ameliorating the oxidant stress. Both FMT and phloretin treatment increased the levels of Bacteroidetes, Alistipes and Lactobacillus and decreased those of Firmicutes, Oscillibacter and Ruminiclostridium_6. Correlation analysis between gut microbes and micro-environmental factors revealed that Alistipes abundance was negatively correlated with DAI, pathological score, and TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β levels, and Alistipes was more abundant in phloretin or FMT treated UC mice. Oscillibacter abundance was significantly positively correlated with IL-6 and IL-1β levels and pathological score, and Oscillibacter was increased in UC mice. Furthermore, network analysis of the dominant genera revealed that Alistipes abundance was negatively related to Oscillibacter abundance. In conclusion, this study suggests that the anti-UC effects of phloretin are achieved through regulation of the gut  and phloretin has the potential to be developed as a promising agent for the treatment of UC.Copyright © 2019.

New approaches are needed to improve respiratory health and reduce premature mortality of chronic diseases by 30% till 2030 (UN Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs). Planetary health is defined as the health of human civilization and the state of the natural systems on which it depends. Planetary health and human health are interconnected, and both need to be considered by individuals and governments while addressing several SDGs.The concept of the Nature Step has evolved from innovative research indicating, how changed lifestyle in urban surroundings reduces contact with biodiverse environments, impoverishes , affects immune regulation and increases risk of NCDs. The Nature Step calls for strengthening connections to nature. Physical activity in natural environments should be promoted, use of fresh vegetables, fruits and water increased, and consumption of sugary drinks, tobacco and alcohol restricted. Nature relatedness should be part of everyday life and especially emphasized in the care of children and the elderly. Taking "nature" to modern cities in a controlled way is possible but a challenge for urban planning, nature conservation, housing, traffic arrangements, energy production, and importantly for supplying and distributing food. Actions against the well-known respiratory risk factors, air pollution and smoking, should be taken simultaneously.In Finland and elsewhere in Europe, successful programmes have been implemented to reduce the burden of respiratory disorders and other NCDs. Unhealthy behaviour can be changed by well-coordinated actions involving all stakeholders. The growing public health concern caused by NCDs in urban surroundings cannot be solved by health care alone; a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681810>Respiratory Dysbiosis in Canine Bacterial Pneumonia: Standard Culture vs. Microbiome Sequencing.</a></h1><p>It is unknown how the respiratory microbiome influences and is influenced by bacterial pneumonia in dogs, as culture of lung samples and not microbial sequencing guides clinical practice. While accurate identification of pathogens are essential for treatment, not all bacteria are cultivable and the impact of respiratory dysbiosis on development of pneumonia is unclear. The study purposes were to (1) characterize the lung microbiome in canine bacterial pneumonia and compare deviations in dominant microbial populations with historical healthy controls, (2) compare bacteria identified by culture vs. 16S rDNA sequencing from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) culture-, and (3) evaluate similarities in lung and oropharyngeal (OP) microbial communities in community-acquired and secondary bacterial pneumonia. Twenty BALF samples from 15 client-owned dogs diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia were enrolled. From a subset of dogs, OP swabs were collected. Extracted DNA underwent PCR of the 16S rRNA gene. Relative abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were determined. The relative abundance of bacterial community members found in health was decreased in dogs with pneumonia. Taxa identified via culture were not always the dominant phylotype identified with sequencing. Dogs with community-acquired pneumonia were more likely to have overgrowth of a single organism suggesting loss of dominant species associated with health. Dogs with secondary bacterial pneumonia had a greater regional continuity between the upper and lower airways. Collectively, these data suggest that dysbiosis occurs in canine bacterial pneumonia, and culture-independent techniques may provide greater depth of understanding of the changes in bacterial community composition that occur in disease.Copyright © 2019 Vientós-Plotts, Ericsson, Rindt and Reinero.</p></html>
