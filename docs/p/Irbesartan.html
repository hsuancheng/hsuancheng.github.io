Pretreatment baseline blood pressure (BP) and posttreatment BP on the 28th day were measured. Plasma  concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence. The KCNJ11 I337V gene polymorphism was determined using high-throughput TaqMan technology.The HapMap data in the Han Chinese population showed that the I337V was used as a representative for 4 common functional polymorphisms. Our results showed that the association of antihypertensive response to  and the KCNJ11 genetic variant in the total sample was not significant. However, in nonsmokers, relative to the GG genotype, subjects with the homozygous AA genotype had a significantly higher therapeutic response to  (adjusted beta ± SE: 4.7±1.9 mm Hg, P = 0.015). In smokers, the subjects with the homozygous AA genotype had a significantly lower therapeutic response to  (adjusted beta ± SE: -5.6±2.5 mm Hg, P = 0.026). A multivariate linear regression model confirmed that there was a significant interactive effect between the KCNJ11 gene and smoking on  treatment (interaction P = 0.001).The interactive effect of smoking status and the KCNJ11 genotype may influence the antihypertensive effects of , which indicates a consideration for future individualized antihypertensive drug treatment.© American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2015.

Relating the initial albuminuria reduction to subsequent renoprotection assumes that the initial ARB-induced albuminuria reduction remains stable during follow-up. The aim of this study was to assess individual albuminuria fluctuations after the initial ARB response and to determine whether taking individual albuminuria fluctuations into account improves renal outcome prediction.Patients with diabetes and nephropathy treated with losartan or  in the RENAAL and IDNT trials were included. Patients with >30% reduction in albuminuria 3 months after ARB initiation were stratified by the subsequent change in albuminuria until Month 12 in enhanced responders (>50% albuminuria reduction), sustained responders (between 20 and 50% reduction), and response escapers (<20% reduction). Predictive performance of the individual albuminuria exposure until Month 3 was compared with the exposure over the first 12 months using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves.Following ARB initiation, 388 (36.3%) patients showed an >30% reduction in albuminuria. Among these patients, the albuminuria level further decreased in 174 (44.8%), remained stable in 123 (31.7%), and increased in 91 (23.5%) patients. Similar albuminuria fluctuations were observed in patients with <30% albuminuria reduction. Renal risk prediction improved when using the albuminuria exposure during the first 12 months versus the initial Month 3 change [ROC difference: 0.78 (95% CI 0.75-0.82) versus 0.68 (0.64-0.72); P < 0.0001].Following the initial response to ARBs, a large within-patient albuminuria variability is observed. Hence, incorporating multiple albuminuria measurements over time in risk algorithms may be more appropriate to monitor treatment effects and quantify renal risk.© The Author 2016.

Thus, a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of anti-HTN drugs and statins may be useful for treating CVD. This study evaluated the efficacy of an FDC of  and atorvastatin (Rovelito) in Korean patients.Patients with HTN and hypercholesterolemia were screened for this prospective, observational, descriptive, multi-center, phase IV study. Eligible patients were administered with Rovelito for 3 months. Dose adjustment was allowed based on the physician's discretion. Blood pressure (BP) goal was <140/90 mmHg, and blood lipid goal was based on Adult Treatment Panel III. Compliance with therapeutic lifestyle modification and safety of the study drugs were evaluated.Of the 2,777 patients enrolled in this study, 931 were analyzed for clinical efficacy. BP and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals were achieved in 801 (86.04%) and 797 (85.61%) patients, respectively. For the BP goal, higher baseline BP and higher body mass index were risk factors for treatment failure. For LDL-C goal, baseline LDL-C level, number of concomitant drugs, smoking status, and alcohol consumption were risk factors for treatment failure. Of the 931 participants, 694 (74.54%) achieved the treatment goals for both BP and LDL-C. Smoking status, alcohol consumption, number of concomitant drugs, and higher baseline LDL-C and BP levels were risk factors for treatment failure in both BP and LDL-C goals. Adherence with Rovelito was 97.90%±5.79%, and incidence of adverse events was 4.19% (116).FDC of  and atorvastatin (Rovelito) could be extremely helpful in treating patients with both HTN and hypercholesterolemia. Poor metabolic profiles were risk factors for poor treatment response and the reason for choosing Rovelito. Therapeutic lifestyle modification should still be underscored despite the 75% treatment success rate with Rovelito for both conditions.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23692319>Angiotensin II antagonists - an assessment of their acute toxicity.</a></h2><p>In Germany, increasing prescription rates of angiotensin II antagonists resulted in rising enquiries to Poisons Information Centres (PICs) during the last decade.

Inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) efficaciously suppressed angiotensin II (ANG II)-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis by blocking insulin-like growth factor II receptor (IGF-IIR) signaling. However, the detailed mechanism by which ANG II induces ERK-mediated IGF-IIR signaling remains elusive. Here, we found that ANG II activated ERK to upregulate IGF-IIR expression via the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT R). ERK activation subsequently phosphorylates HSF1 at serine 307, leading to a secondary phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase III (GSK3) at serine 303. Moreover, we found that ANG II mediated ERK/GSK3-induced IGF-IIR protein stability by downregulating the E3 ubiquitin ligase of IGF-IIR RING finger protein CXXVI (RNF126). The expression of RNF126 decreased following ANG II-induced HSF1 phosphorylation, resulting in IGF-IIR protein stability and increased cardiomyocyte injury. Inhibition of GSK3 significantly alleviated ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, these results suggest that HSF1 phosphorylation stabilizes IGF-IIR protein stability by downregulating RNF126 during cardiac hypertrophy. ANG II activates ERK/GSK3 to phosphorylate HSF1, resulting in RNF126 degradation, which stabilizes IGF-IIR protein expression and eventually results in cardiac hypertrophy. HSF1 could be a valuable therapeutic target for cardiac diseases among hypertensive patients.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24418215>Renal protection by low dose  in diabetic nephropathy is paralleled by a reduction of , not of endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>Diabetes can disrupt endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis which leads to ER stress.

Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect markers of ER stress, renal damage and infiltrating cells. Glomerulosclerosis and apoptosis were evaluated. Diabetic mRen2-transgenic rats developed renal injury with proteinuria, tubulointerstitial cell proliferation as well as glomerulosclerosis and podocyte injury. Moreover, an increase in , podocyte ER stress and apoptosis was detected.  somewhat lowered blood pressure and reduced proteinuria, tubulointerstitial cell proliferation and glomerulosclerosis. Podocyte damage was ameliorated but markers of ER stress (calnexin, grp78) and apoptosis were not reduced by .

Patients with diabetes or established cardiovascular, renal, or liver disease were excluded. Blood samples and 24-hour urine were analyzed at baseline and 6 months after pharmaceutical BP normalization. Serum creatinine was measured and eGFR was calculated.

Eight ARBs are clinically available [azilsartan, candesartan, eprosartan, , losartan, olmesartan, telmisartan, valsartan]. Azilsartan (in some countries), candesartan, and olmesartan are orally administered as prodrugs, whereas the blocking action of some is mediated through active metabolites. On the basis of their chemical structures, ARBs use different binding pockets in the receptor, which are associated with differences in dissociation times and, in most cases, apparently insurmountable antagonism. The physicochemical differences between ARBs also manifest in different tissue penetration, including passage through the blood-brain barrier. Differences in binding mode and tissue penetration are also associated with differences in pharmacokinetic profile, particularly duration of action. Although generally highly specific for angiotensin II type 1 receptors, some ARBs, particularly telmisartan, are partial agonists at peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. All of these properties are comprehensively reviewed in this article. Although there is general consensus that a continuous receptor blockade over a 24-hour period is desirable, the clinical relevance of other pharmacological differences between individual ARBs remains to be assessed.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function', 'diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28733707>Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers Inhibit KAT II Activity in the Brain-Its Possible Clinical Applications.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are one of the most frequently recommended antihypertensive drugs. Apart from their activity towards the circulatory system, ARBs also penetrate the blood-brain barrier and display neuroprotective effects. Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is an endogenous metabolite of tryptophan produced by kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II) in the brain. Antagonism towards all ionotropic glutamate (GLU) receptors is the main mechanism of KYNA action. An elevated brain level of KYNA is linked with memory impairment and psychotic symptoms. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of three ARBs: , losartan, and telmisartan on KYNA production and KAT II activity in rat brain. The effect of ARBs on KYNA production was analyzed in rat brain cortical slices and on isolated KAT II enzyme. , losartan, and telmisartan decreased KYNA production and KAT II activity in a dose-dependent manner in rat brain cortex in vitro. Molecular docking suggested that the examined ARBs could bind to an active site of KAT II. In conclusion, ARBs decrease KYNA production in rat brain by direct inhibition of KAT II enzymatic activity.

We examined the extent to which the angiotensin-II type 1 receptor blocker (AT1RB)  and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) perindopril affected the apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, cytochrome-c and Ku70 in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats.Animals were divided into five groups of eight each, four of which received STZ (60mg/kg in a single dose, i.p.) to induce diabetes. The groups were performed as untreated diabetic; non-diabetic control; daily  (15mg/kg/day) or perindopril (6mg/kg/day) and also combined  and perindopril (respectively, 5mg/kg/day, 3mg/kg/day) were applied by gavage for 30days to STZ-diabetic rats. The kidney tissue analysis was performed by using immunohistochemical staining with Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, cytochrome-c and Ku70 antibodies and by using Western blot analysis with caspase-3 and cytochrome-c antibodies.Immunoreactivity of Bax, caspase-3, cytochrome-c and Ku70 was increased in the tubuli and glomeruli of the untreated diabetic group, but decreased in all treated diabetic groups. In the  and perindopril treated diabetic groups Bcl-2 immunoreactivity was higher than that of the untreated diabetic group. Caspase-3 and cytoplasmic cytochrome-c protein levels increased in the untreated diabetic group.We conclude that the increased expression of Bax and caspase-3, and the increased level of cytoplasmic cytochrome-c relate to renal tissue injury. This case is also seen in the early stages of diabetes as a result of the damage caused by local increased expression of renin angiotensin system (RAS) in the renal tissue, which is induced by hyperglycemia. The increase of the cytosolic cytochrome-c, caspase-3 and Ku70 expression in the tubuli is suggestive of apoptosis. Overall, our results show that treatments of  and perindopril are effective and efficient in preventing renal tissue injury and apoptosis by blocking the RAS in experimental diabetic nephropathy and reducing the expression of proteins associated with apoptosis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The method is based on the reaction of carboxylic acid group of the oxidized  with a mixture of potassium iodate (KIO(3)) and iodide (KI) to form yellow colored triiodide ions in aqueous medium at 30+/-1 degrees C. The reaction is followed spectrophotometrically by measuring the rate of change of absorbance at 352 nm. The initial-rate and fixed-time (DeltaA) methods are adopted for constructing the calibration curves, which were found to be linear over the concentration ranges of 10.0-60.0 and 7.5-60.0 microg ml(-1) respectively. The regression analysis of calibration data yielded the linear equations: rate=-2.138 x 10(-6)+1.058 x 10(-4)C and DeltaA=-3.75 x 10(-3)+3.25 x 10(-3)C for initial rate and fixed time (DeltaA) methods, respectively. The limit of detection for initial rate and fixed time methods are 0.21 and 2.40 mug ml(-1), respectively. The various activation parameters such as E(a), DeltaH++, DeltaS++ and DeltaG++ are also calculated for the reaction and found to be 70.95+/-0.43 kJ mol(-1), 68.48+/-0.21 kJ mol(-1), 16.54+/-0.24 J K(-1) mol(-1) and -4.94+/-0.07 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The proposed methods are optimized and validated as per the guidelines of International Conference on Harmonisation (U.S.A.). The point and interval hypothesis tests have been performed which indicate that there is no significant difference between the proposed methods and the reference method.

Here, we characterize two angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), telmisartan and , as new selective PPAR modulators (SPPARMs). Analysis of PPARgamma protein conformation using protease protection showed that telmisartan directly interacts with the receptor, producing a distinct conformational change compared with a glitazone. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down and fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays revealed selective cofactor binding by the ARBs compared with glitazones with an attenuated release of the nuclear receptor corepressor and absence of transcriptional intermediary factor 2 recruitment by ARBs. Consistently, selective cofactor binding resulted in differential gene expression profiles in adipocytes (ARB versus glitazone treated) assessed by oligo microarray analysis. Finally, telmisartan improved insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obese mice in the absence of  gain. The present study identifies two ARBs as new SPPARMs. SPPARM activity by ARBs could retain the metabolic efficacy of PPARgamma activation with reduction in adverse effects exerting in parallel AT1 receptor blockade. This may provide a new therapeutic option for better cardiovascular risk management in metabolic diseases and may initiate the development of new classes of drugs combining potent antihypertensive and antidiabetic actions.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23176212>Class- and molecule-specific differential effects of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 (AT1) receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily and contains 359 amino acids. AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs, e.g., eprosartan, losartan, candesartan, valsartan, telmisartan, olmesartan, , and azilsartan) have been developed and are available for clinical use, and basic and clinical studies have shown that ARBs are useful for preventing the development of cardiovascular disease. While most ARBs have common molecular structures (biphenyl-tetrazol and imidazole groups), they also show slightly different structures. Some of the benefits conferred by ARBs may not be class-specific effects, and instead may be molecule-specific effects. Their common molecular structures are thought to be responsible for their class effects, whereas their slightly different structures may be important for promoting molecule-specific effects. This review focuses on current evidence regarding the class- and molecule-specific differential effects of ARBs from basic experiments to clinical settings.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27564102>Angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) is an independent prognosticator of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and promotes cells proliferation via mTOR activation.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the angiotensin II/ angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) and angiotensin II type II receptor (AT2R) signaling pathway in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the expression levels of AT1R and AT2R in tissues from 152 surgically resected ESCC patients, and those expression levels were then correlated with treatment outcomes. The angiotensin II/AT1R/AT2R signaling pathway and its biological effects in the context of ESCC were investigated in vitro and in vivo.In human samples, AT1R overexpression was univariately associated with inferior overall survival and remained multivariately independent (hazard ratio=1.812). In vitro, angiotensin II stimulated the growth of ESCC cells in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with  or AT1R-RNAi knockdown but not treatment with PD123319 significantly decreased the level of angiotensin II-induced ESCC cell proliferation. Angiotensin II also caused mTOR activation in a dose-dependent manner, and everolimus or mTOR-RNAi knockdown significantly suppressed the level of angiotensin II-induced ESCC cell proliferation. Furthermore, AT1R-RNAi knockdown suppressed the activation of mTOR. Clinically, AT1R expression was also correlated with phosphorylated mTOR expression. In a xenograft model, local angiotensin II injection enhanced tumor growth, and this effect could be decreased by treatment with  or everolimus. In a 4-NQO-induced-ESCC murine model,  significantly decreased the incidence of esophageal tumor.These findings suggest that AT1R overexpression is an independent adverse prognosticator for patients with ESCC and that angiotensin II/AT1R signaling stimulates ESCC growth, in part through mTOR activation.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22529804>Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and double thrombophilic defect: a new observation.</a></h2><p>WE REPORT THE FIRST CASE OF NONARTERITIC ANTERIOR ISCHEMIC NEUROPATHY (NAION) ASSOCIATED WITH DOUBLE THROMBOPHILIA: protein S deficiency and prothrombin G20210A mutation. A 58-year-old man is presented including the clinical and laboratory findings, cardiovascular profile and thrombophilia screening. The patient presented with 3/10 vision and an inferior altitudinal defect in the right eye. Funduscopic examination of the right eye revealed a hyperemic optic disk with blurred superior optic disk border and sectoral nerve fiber layer edema. Complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were normal, suggesting a NAION. A workup of cardiovascular risk factors revealed , arterial hypertension and high-risk asymptomatic coronary artery disease. Due to the family history of deep vein thrombosis in the patient's daughter, a thrombophilia screening was additionally performed. The results revealed a double thrombophilic defect, namely congenital protein S deficiency and heterozygosity for prothrombin G20210A mutation, which were also identified in the patient's daughter. Anticoagulant warfarin therapy was initiated and the patient underwent a triple bypass surgery. At three-month follow-up, the right optic disk edema had resolved, leaving a pale superior optic nerve head. Visual acuity in the right eye had slightly improved to 4/10; however, the dense inferior altitudinal field defect had remained unchanged. The patient is currently treated with warfarin, atorvastatin,  and metoprolol. This case suggests that the first line of investigation in all patients with NAION involves assessment of cardiovascular risk factors. However, careful history taking will identify NAION patients who are eligible for additional thrombophilia screening: young patients without vasculopathic risk factors, bilateral or recurrent NAION, idiopathic or recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), positive family history of VTE, and VTE in young age or in unusual sites (e.g. cerebral, hepatic, mesenteric, or renal vein).</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15806974>[The renoprotect effect of shenhua recipe on 5/6 renal ablation rats].</a></h2><p>To investigate the reno protective effect of Shenhua recipe on the experimental model of 5/6 renal ablation.5/6 renal ablation rats were underlying this experiment.

So, we investigated renal protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, alone and in combination with  in a rat model of diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic rats, injected with nicotinamide-streptozotocin, were treated orally for 12 weeks with either vehicle, dapagliflozin 2 mg/kg/day,  30 mg/kg/day, or combination of both drugs; respectively. Biochemical analysis included blood glucose, HbA1c, urinary albumin excretion, creatinine clearance, TGF-β1, sRAGE, oxidative markers, and histopathological examination of kidneys. Treatment with dapagliflozin, , and especially their combination, produced significant reduction in albuminuria, improved renal function parameters, increased sRAGE level and improved inflammatory and oxidative markers, together with amelioration of renal histopathological changes. Beside glycemic control, dapagliflozin produced higher sRAGE levels than , suggesting that inhibition of AGE-RAGE axis is important in its renoprotective action. Combination of dapagliflozin and  produced more remarkable protective effects on renal function and structure, than use of either agent alone. It is concluded that, combination of SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin and ARB,  could offer more effective renal protection and represent a promising therapeutic option for management of diabetic nephropathy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Chronic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation, shown by elevated plasma renin activity (PRA), is implicated in many of the features of metabolic syndrome. The direct renin inhibitor aliskiren may be of benefit in this patient group as aliskiren targets the RAAS at the rate-limiting step. In this double-blind study, 141 patients with hypertension (mean baseline BP 155/93 mm Hg) and metabolic syndrome (modified National Cholesterol Education Program ATP III criteria) were randomized to aliskiren 300 mg or  300 mg once daily. Patients treated with aliskiren 300 mg had their mean sitting blood pressure (BP) lowered by 13.8/7.1 mm Hg after 12 weeks, significantly greater (P≤0.001) than the 5.8/2.8 mm Hg reduction observed in patients treated with  300 mg. A significantly greater proportion of patients treated with aliskiren achieved BP control to <135/85 mm Hg (29.2 vs 16.7% with ; P=0.019).

Young Ren2 and age-matched Sprague-Dawley (SD) controls (age 6-9 wk) were treated with a renin inhibitor (aliskiren), an ARB (), or vehicle for 21 days. Ren2 rats exhibited increases in systolic pressure (SBP), albuminuria, and renal 3-nitrotyrosine content as well as ultrastructural podocyte foot-process effacement and diminution of the podocyte-specific protein nephrin. Structural and functional alterations were accompanied by increased renal cortical ANG II, AT1R, as well as NADPH oxidase subunit (Nox2) expression compared with SD controls.

Treatment of patients with MetS regularly includes drugs prescribed simultaneously to treat diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the development of novel multidrug formulations is recommended. However, the main problem with these drugs is their low solubility. The use of binary co-amorphous systems emerges as a promising strategy to increase drug solubility. In the present study,  (IBS) and glimepiride (GMP), class II active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), widely used in the treatment of arterial hypertension and diabetes, were selected to develop a novel binary co-amorphous system with remarkable enhancement in the dissolution of both APIs. The phase diagram of IBS-GMP was constructed and co-amorphous systems were prepared by melt-quench, in a wide range of compositions. Dissolution profile (studied at pH 1.2 and 37°C for mole fractions 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5) demonstrated that the x = 0.01 formulation presents the highest enhancement in its dissolution. GMP went from being practically insoluble to reach 3.9 ± 0.9 μg/mL, and IBS showed a 12-fold increment with respect to the dissolution of its crystalline form. Infrared studies showed that the increase in the dissolution profile is related to the intermolecular interactions (hydrogen bonds), which were dependent of composition. Results of structural and thermal characterization performed by XRD and DSC showed that samples have remained in amorphous state for more than 10 months of storage.

Molecular mechanisms underlying this are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that c-Src activation, through receptor tyrosine kinase transactivation, is critically involved in synergistic interactions between Aldo and Ang II and that it is upstream of promigratory signaling pathways in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).VSMCs from WKY rats were studied. At low concentrations (10(-10) mol/L) Aldo and Ang II alone did not influence c-Src activation, whereas in combination they rapidly increased phosphorylation (P<0.01), an effect blocked by eplerenone (Aldo receptor antagonist) and  (AT1R blocker). This synergism was attenuated by AG1478 and AG1296 (inhibitors of EGFR and PDGFR, respectively), but not by AG1024 (IGFR inhibitor). Aldo and Ang II costimulation induced c-Src-dependent activation of NAD(P)H oxidase and c-Src-independent activation of ERK1/2 (P<0.05), without effect on ERK5, p38MAPK, or JNK. Aldo/Ang II synergistically activated RhoA/Rho kinase and VSMC migration, effects blocked by PP2, apocynin, and fasudil, inhibitors of c-Src, NADPH oxidase, and Rho kinase, respectively.Aldo/Ang II synergistically activate c-Src, an immediate signaling response, through EGFR and PDGFR, but not IGFR transactivation. This is associated with activation of redox-regulated RhoA/Rho kinase, which controls VSMC migration. Although Aldo and Ang II interact to stimulate ERK1/2, such effects are c-Src-independent. These findings indicate differential signaling in Aldo-Ang II crosstalk and highlight the importance of c-Src in redox-sensitive RhoA, but not ERK1/2 signaling. Blockade of Aldo/Ang II may be therapeutically useful in vascular remodeling associated with abnormal VSMC migration.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18946564>Short-term effects of  treatment on microalbuminuria in patients with normotensive type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>To observe the short-term effects of  treatment on microalbuminuria in patients with normotensive type 2 diabetes.A total of 40 normotensive type 2 diabetes patients (mean age 55.1+/-11.4 years) who had microalbuminuria were included in this non-comparative and prospective research study. The study took place in Ege University Hospital, Bornova-Izmir, Turkey, between January 2005 and April 2005. Patients were treated with  300mg/day for 3 months. Physical examination, medical history, systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels, microalbuminuria, diabetes markers fasting and non-fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c],  profile, creatinine and urea were obtained at baseline and after 3 months of  treatment. The primary assessment criterion was the change in microalbuminuria.The mean microalbuminuria level at baseline was 110.8+/-93.1mg/24 hours. It significantly decreased to 45.6+/-62.5mg/24 hours at the end of 3 months of  treatment (p<0.001). When patients were stratified according to the change in the microalbuminuria status after treatment, 90% of them either returned to normo albuminuria or their microalbuminuria decreased.

Results were compared with those in the iliac artery and abdominal aorta and the coronary circulation of the Wistar rat. Ang II, III, and IV decreased coronary flow in SHRs and Wistar rats, with Ang III and IV being approximately 10 and approximately 1000 times less potent than Ang II. Ang-(1-7) decreased coronary flow at concentrations >1 micromol/L in SHRs. The Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist  blocked the effects of Ang II, III, and IV, whereas the Ang II type 2 receptor antagonist PD123319 blocked the effects of Ang-(1-7). The maximal Ang II- and III-induced decreases in coronary flow in SHRs were twice as large as those in Wistar rats. PD123319 enhanced the constrictor effects of Ang II and III in Wistar rats so that, in the presence of this drug, their effects were comparable to those in SHRs. In contrast, PD123319 did not alter the Ang II- and III-induced responses in SHRs and blocked the constrictor effect of Ang II in iliac arteries. Ang II type 2 receptor-mediated relaxation did not occur in iliac arteries and abdominal aortas, and the constrictor effects of Ang metabolites in these vessels were identical in Wistar rats and SHRs. In conclusion, coronary constriction induced by Ang II, Ang III, and Ang-(1-7) is enhanced in SHRs as compared with Wistar rats. This is attributable to the absence of counterregulatory Ang II type 2 receptor-mediated relaxation and/or a change of the Ang II type 2 receptor phenotype from relaxant to constrictor.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15037537>Blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor stabilizes atherosclerotic plaques in humans by inhibiting prostaglandin E2-dependent matrix metalloproteinase activity.</a></h2><p>Clinical trials have demonstrated that agents that inhibit the angiotensin II pathway confer benefit beyond the reduction of blood pressure alone.

Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the effect of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist  on the inflammatory infiltration and expression of COX-2/mPGES-1 and MMPs in human carotid plaques.Seventy patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis were randomized to  (300 mg/d) or chlorthalidone (50 mg/d) for 4 months before endarterectomy. Plaques were subjected to analysis of COX-1, COX-2, mPGES-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9, angiotensin II, AT(1), AT2, and collagen content by immunocytochemistry, Western blot, and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, whereas zymography was used to detect MMP activity. Immunohistochemistry was also used to identify CD68+ macrophages, CD3+ T lymphocytes, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and HLA-DR+ inflammatory cells. Plaques from the  group had fewer (P<0.0001) macrophages, T lymphocytes, and HLA-DR+ cells; less (P<0.0001) immunoreactivity for COX-2/mPGES-1 and MMPs; reduced (P<0.0001) gelatinolytic activity; and increased (P<0.0001) collagen content.

However, there currently exists limited "pooled" data examining the long-term efficacy of ARB treatment in controlling BP or mitigating cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the long-term effects of ARBs as a class on BP control, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, cerebrovascular events (ie, stroke), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception to March 2015. Two evaluators independently reviewed studies for eligibility. Randomized controlled hypertension trials were included if they reported on ARB efficacy in either BP control (relative to placebo for periods ≥ 6 months) or cardiovascular/cerebrovascular outcomes (relative to non-ARB antihypertensive therapies for periods ≥ 24 months). Studies were pooled with a random-effects model using weighted mean differences (WMDs) and relative risks for continuous and dichotomous outcomes, respectively. A total of 11 articles were included in the narrative synthesis, representing seven unique trials (16,864 participants). Six ARB agents were studied: candesartan, eprosartan, , olmesartan, losartan (each represented by one trial arm), and telmisartan (represented by two arms). ARB therapy significantly reduced mean systolic BP (WMD: -4.86; 95% CI: -6.19, -3.53 mm Hg) and diastolic BP (WMD: -2.75; 95% CI: -3.65, -1.86 mm Hg] compared to placebo. The risk of stroke was reduced by 21% in the ARB group compared with alternative antihypertensives (risk ratio: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.96). ARBs did not, however, produce statistically significant reductions in the risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure hospitalization, or mortality. Our findings suggest that ARBs, as a class, are more effective than placebo therapy in long-term BP lowering in patients with essential hypertension. Long-term ARB treatment may also confer enhanced protection against stroke but not other cardiovascular outcomes relative to placebo.Copyright © 2016 American Society of Hypertension.

Our aim was to determine whether urinary angiotensinogen and renin are circulating RAAS-independent markers during RAAS blockade.Urinary and plasma levels of angiotensinogen, renin, and albumin were measured in 22 patients with type 2 , hypertension, and albuminuria, during 2-month treatment periods with placebo, aliskiren, , or their combination in random order in a crossover study.Aliskiren and  both increased plasma renin 3-4-fold, and above 10-fold when combined.  decreased plasma angiotensinogen by approximately 25%, and no changes in plasma angiotensinogen were observed during the combination. Urine contained aliskiren at micromolar levels, blocking urinary renin by above 90%. Both blockers reduced urinary angiotensinogen, significant for  only. Combination blockade reduced urinary angiotensinogen even further. Reductions in urinary angiotensinogen paralleled albuminuria changes, and the urine/plasma concentration ratio of angiotensinogen was identical to that of albumin under all conditions. In contrast, urinary renin did not follow albumin, and remained unaltered after all treatments. Yet, the urine/plasma concentration ratio of renin was more than 100-fold higher than that of angiotensinogen and albumin, and approximately 4-fold reduced by single RAAS blockade, and more than 10-fold by dual RAAS blockade.Aliskiren filters into urine and influences urinary renin measurements. The urine/plasma renin ratio, but not urinary renin alone, may reflect the renal efficacy of RAAS blockade. Urinary angiotensinogen is a marker of filtration barrier damage rather than intrarenal RAAS activity.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function', 'diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18806627>Role of angiotensin II, endothelin-1 and L-type calcium channel in the development of glomerular, tubulointerstitial and perivascular fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Fibrosis is a hallmark of renal damage in several diseases, including arterial hypertension.

Glomerular fibrosis was lowered by BMS (P < 0.001), whereas tubulointerstitial fibrosis was blunted by bosentan (P < 0.001) and  (P < 0.005). Perivascular fibrosis was reduced by nifedipine and BMS. As only  and  plus BMS decreased blood pressure (P < 0.001 vs. placebo), these effects on fibrosis were independent of blood pressure.Angiotensin II and L-type calcium channels modulate fibrosis selectively in the tubulointerstitial and in the perivascular compartments, respectively.

Diabetic state was associated with increased ACE2 in Akita mice, whereas additional loss of ACE2 in these mice leads to increased plasma and tissue angiotensin II levels, resulting in systolic dysfunction on a background of impaired diastolic function. Downregulation of SERCA2 and lipotoxicity were equivalent in Akita and Akita/ACE2KO hearts and are likely mediators of the diastolic dysfunction. However, greater activation of protein kinase C and loss of Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation occurred in the Akita/ACE2KO hearts. Systolic dysfunction in Akita/ACE2KO mice was linked to enhanced activation of NADPH oxidase and metalloproteinases, resulting in greater oxidative stress and degradation of the extracellular matrix. Impaired flow-mediated dilation in vivo correlated with increased vascular oxidative stress in Akita/ACE2KO mice.

The gradual decline in kidney function in the presence of these risk factors is also associated with increased cardiovascular disease. Excess angiotensin II production by the renin-angiotensin system is responsible, at least in part, for development of hypertension and for damage in the kidneys and the cardiovascular system. Pharmacological targeting of the renin-angiotensin system not only reduces blood pressure, but may also provides more direct vascular protection.

All ARBs tested to date have proved effective in improving at least some aspects of renal dysfunction. Few within-class comparative studies exist. Telmisartan provides superior reductions in proteinuria to losartan, however, even when blood pressures are equalized with concomitant antihypertensives. This superiority is probably linked to higher receptor affinity, longer plasma half-life and higher lipophilicity of telmisartan compared with other ARBs.

Therapy with delapril/manidipine also appears to exert beneficial effects that extend beyond a reduction in BP, including nephroprotective activity and an improvement in fibrinolytic balance, supporting its value as a treatment option in these patient populations at high or very high cardiovascular risk because of the presence of organ damage, diabetes or renal disease.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30576864>Investigating tissue bioconcentration and the behavioural effects of two pharmaceutical pollutants on sea trout (Salmo trutta) in the laboratory and field.</a></h2><p>Pharmaceuticals entering aquatic ecosystems via wastewater effluents are of increasing concern for wild animals. Because some pharmaceuticals are designed to modulate human behaviour, measuring the impacts of exposure to pharmaceuticals on fish behaviour has become a valuable endpoint. While laboratory studies have shown that pharmaceuticals can affect fish behaviour, there is a lack of understanding if behaviour is similarly affected in natural environments. Here, we exposed sea trout (Salmo trutta) smolts to two concentrations of two pharmaceutical pollutants often detected in surface waters: temazepam (a benzodiazepine, anxiolytic) or  (an angiotensin II receptor blocker, anti-hypertensive). We tested the hypothesis that changes to behavioural traits (anxiety and activity) measured in laboratory trials following exposure are predictive of behaviour in the natural environment (downstream migration). Measures of anxiety and activity in the laboratory assay did not vary with temazepam treatment, but temazepam-exposed fish began migrating faster in the field. Activity in the laboratory assay did predict overall migration speed in the field. In contrast to temazepam, we found that  exposure did not affect behaviour in the laboratory, field, or the relationship between the two endpoints. However,  was also not readily taken up into fish tissue (i.e. below detection levels in the muscle tissue), while temazepam bioconcentrated (bioconcentration factor 7.68) rapidly (t < 24 h). Our findings add to a growing literature showing that benzodiazepine pollutants can modulate fish behaviour and that laboratory assays may be less sensitive at detecting the effects of pollutants compared to measuring effects in natural settings. Therefore, we underscore the importance of measuring behavioural effects in the natural environment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, Euonymus alatus showed therapeutic potential in the treatment of  and its chronic complications. In this study, effects of Euonymus alatus and its mechanism in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy were investigated. Diabetic nephropathy was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by uninephrectomy plus streptozotocin (STZ) administration. Euonymus alatus and , as a positive control, were lavaged to these rats for 12 weeks. Our data showed that Euonymus alatus was efficient in lowering HbA1c, improving blood lipids, decreasing 24 h urine protein and protecting kidney function. Pathological studies found kidney damage, including extracellular matrix expansion and glomerulosclerosis, were improved by Euonymus alatus treatment. Further investigation found that the herb had a role in downregulating the expression of transform growth factor β(1). In conclusion, Euonymus alatus has a protective role in diabetic nephropathy, which may be related to its downregulation of transform growth factor β(1) expression.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28618426>Renoprotective Effect of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers in Diabetic Patients with Proteinuria.</a></h2><p>Limited evidence exists on the choice of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in diabetic patients with nephropathy. We aim to assess the renal effectiveness and safety of these drugs among diabetic nephropathy patients.This retrospective cohort study was conducted with diabetic nephropathy patients who initiated ACEI or ARB monotherapy. The primary outcome was a composite of end stage of renal disease and renal transplantation, and the secondary outcome was all-cause mortality. The safety endpoint was hyperkalemia.Three thousand seven hundred and thirty-nine ACEI users and 3,316 ARB users were identified.

Experimental animals were maintained on either , a selective AT1-receptor antagonist, or no treatment. Measurement of cardiac hypertrophy, diastolic function, and sarcoendoplasmic reticulum adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase; SERCA) and phospholamban (PLB) gene expression was assessed at 6 weeks after MI. Myocardial infarction caused a significant increase in myocardial mass and left ventricular (LV) filling pressure, whereas LV systolic pressure and +dP/dt were reduced. The time constant of isovolumic relaxation (tau) was markedly prolonged after MI. Post-MI hypertrophy was associated with substantial increases in the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), but no significant changes in SERCA or PLB levels. Although  treatment did not significantly alter post-MI LV systolic or filling pressures, it nevertheless effectively decreased ventricular hypertrophy, improved tau, and normalized ANP expression. These results demonstrate that AT1-receptor antagonism has important effects on myocardial hypertrophy and ANP gene expression, which are independent of ventricular loading conditions. In addition, the improvement in diastolic function was not related to changes in SERCA and PLB gene expression, suggesting that enhanced myocardial relaxation was related to the blockade of AII effects on myocyte function or through a reduction of ventricular hypertrophy itself or both.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11999756>Fast screening method for the determination of angiotensin II receptor antagonists in human plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorimetric detection.</a></h2><p>A selective, accurate and precise high-performance liquid chromatographic assay coupled to fluorescence detection was developed for the detection of some angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARA II): Losartan, , Valsartan, Candesartan cilexetil and its metabolite Candesartan MI.

This procedure allowed recoveries close to 80% for all these drugs excluding Candesartan cilexetil (70%) which presented adsorption processes on glass and plastic walls. The analytes and potential interferences were separated on a reversed-phase column, muBondapak C18, at room temperature. A gradient elution mode was used to carry out the separation, the optimal mobile phase being composed of acetonitrile-5 mM acetate buffer, pH 4, at variable flow-rates (from 1.0 to 1.2 ml/min). Fluorescence detector was set at an excitation wavelength of 250 nm and an emission wavelength of 375 nm. Intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations for all the compounds were lower than 8% except for Losartan (12%) and the method assesses a quite good accuracy (percentage of relative error approximately 6% in most of the cases). The limit of quantitation for these compounds was 3 ng/ml for Candesartan cilexetil and M1, 16 ng/ml for Losartan and 50 ng/ml for  and Valsartan, which allows their determination at expected plasma concentration levels.

Individuals with diabetes are not only more likely to develop hypertension, dyslipidemia, and , but are also at a significantly higher risk for coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke. Angiotensin II plays a key pathophysiological role in the progression of diabetic renal disease, and blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II antagonists has therefore become an important therapeutic strategy to reduce renal and cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes. Several studies have demonstrated the effects of angiotensin II antagonists on the reduction of albuminuria and the progression of renal disease from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria. More importantly, several endpoint trials have shown that the antiproteinuric effects of losartan and  translate into cardiovascular and renoprotective benefits beyond blood pressure lowering, thereby delaying the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation by several years. These and other studies indicate that angiotensin II antagonists not only improve survival and quality of life of patients with diabetic nephropathy, but also have the potential to reduce the substantial healthcare burden associated with managing these patients. ACEi also appear to exert similar beneficial effects in diabetic patients, but whether clinically significant differences in renoprotection or mortality exist between angiotensin II antagonists and ACEi in patients with type 2 diabetes remains to be fully investigated in appropriate head-to-head studies.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26005800>Prognostic significance of quantitative assessment of focal myocardial fibrosis in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of myocardial focal fibrosis quantified by late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).One-hundred eleven HFpEF patients (mean age: 70 ± 14 years, 55 (50%) female) were enrolled. We excluded patients with previous history of coronary artery disease and/or ischemic pattern of hyper enhancement on LGE MRI.

Major adverse cardiovascular events were defined as cardiovascular death and heart failure requiring hospitalization.During a mean follow up period of 851 ± 609 days, 10 events (2 cardiovascular death, 8 hospitalization for heart failure decompensation) were observed. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of LGE% for the detection of future events was 0.721 (95% CI: 0.628-0.802).

The blood pressure control remains a fundamental mechanism for prevention of cardiovascular disease. The renin-angiotensin system is believed to play an important role along different steps of the cardiovascular disease continuum. Convincing evidence accumulated over the last decade that therapeutic intervention with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is effective to slow down or block the progression of cardiovascular disease at different steps of the continuum, with measurable clinical benefits. However, despite the shared mechanism of action, each ARB is characterized by specific pharmacological properties that may influence its clinical efficacy. Indeed, important differences among available ARBs emerged from clinical studies. Therefore, generalization of results obtained with a specific ARB to all available ARBs may be misleading.

Blood samples were taken before torasemide administration and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after administration. After this first study period, patients received either  150 mg (five female and seven male patients aged 69+/-8 years) or losartan 100 mg (two female and ten male patients aged 61+/-8 years) once daily.

The target compounds were detected at concentrations ranging from low ng/L to a few μg/L, which are in the range commonly found in municipal wastewater of the studied area. The changes in concentrations between two sampling points were negligible for most compounds, i.e. from -10 to 10%. A higher decrease in concentrations (25-60 %) during the pass through the pipe was observed for diltiazem, citalopram, clarithromycin, bezafibrate and amlodipine. Negative removal was calculated for sulfamethoxazole (-66 ± 15%) and  (-58 ± 25%), which may be due to the conversion of conjugates back to their parent compounds in the sewer. The results show that microbial transformation of pharmaceuticals begins in sewer, albeit to different extents for different compounds.

Screening can lead to early identification and treatment, both of which incur costs. However, identification and treatment may slow or prevent progression to a more expensive stage of the disease and thus may save money. We assessed the health economic impact of screening for nephropathy (microalbuminuria and overt nephropathy) followed by optimal renoprotective-based antihypertensive therapy in a US setting.A Markov model simulated the lifetime impact of screening with semi-quantitative urine dipsticks in a primary care setting of hypertensive patients with type 2  and subsequent treatment with  300 mg in patients identified as having nephropathy. Progression from no nephropathy to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was simulated. Probabilities, utilities, medication and ESRD treatment costs came from published sources. Clinical outcomes and direct medical costs were projected. Second order Monte Carlo simulation was used to account for uncertainty in multiple parameters. Annual discount rates of 3% were used where appropriate.Screening, followed by optimized treatment, led to a 44% reduction in the cumulative incidence of ESRD and improvements in non-discounted life expectancy of 0.25 +/- 0.22 years/patient (mean +/- SD). Quality-adjusted life expectancy was improved by 0.18 +/- 0.15 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)/patient and direct costs increased by $244 +/- 3499/patient. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $20 011 per QALY gained for screening and optimized treatment versus no screening. There was a 77% probability that screening and optimized therapy would be considered cost effective with a willingness to pay a threshold of $50 000.In patients with type 2  and hypertension, screening for nephropathy and treatment with a renoprotective-based antihypertensive agent was projected to improve patient outcomes and represent excellent value in a US setting.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22939518>Effect of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system on the progression of type 2 diabetic nephropathy: a randomized trial.</a></h2><p>Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers has been shown to lessen the rate of decrease in glomerular filtration rate in patients with diabetic nephropathy.A multicenter open-label randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of combining the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril and the angiotensin II receptor blocker  with that of each drug in monotherapy (at both high and equipotent doses) in slowing the progression of type 2 diabetic nephropathy.133 patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy (age, 66 ± 8 years; 76% men) from 17 centers in Spain.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:2) to lisinopril (n = 35),  (n = 28), or the combination of both (n = 70).The primary composite outcome was a >50% increase in baseline serum creatinine level, end-stage renal disease, or death.Baseline values for mean estimated glomerular filtration rate and blood pressure were 49 ± 21 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and 153 ± 19/81 ± 11 mm Hg.

It participates in the control of hemostasis, blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, platelet and leukocyte interactions with the vessel wall, regulation of vascular tone, and of blood pressure. Many crucial vasoactive endogenous compounds are produced by the endothelial cells to control the functions of vascular smooth muscle cells and of circulating blood cells. These complex systems determine a fine equilibrium which regulates the vascular tone. Impairments in endothelium-dependent vasodilation lead to the so called endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction is then characterized by unbalanced concentrations of vasodilating and vasoconstricting factors, the most important being represented by nitric oxide (NO) and angiotensin II (AT II). High angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity leads to increased AT II generation, reduced NO levels with subsequent vasoconstriction. The net acute effect results in contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells and reduced lumen diameter. Furthermore, when increased ACE activity is chronically sustained, increase in growth, proliferation and differentiation of the vascular smooth muscle cells takes place; at the same time, a decrease in the anti-proliferative action by NO, a decrease in fibinolysis and an increase in platelets aggregation may be observed. AT II is then involved not only in the regulation of blood pressure, but also in vascular , permeability, smooth muscle cells remodelling, and oxidative stress which in turn lead to atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular risk. Given the pivotal role exerted by AT II in contributing to alteration of endothelial function, treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may be of particular interest to restore a physiological activity of endothelial cells. In this view, the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), has been shown to positively affect the endothelial function, beyond the antihypertensive action displayed by these compounds. In this review, attention has been specifically focused on an ARB, , to examine its effects on endothelial function.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23639758> administration therapeutically influences circulating endothelial progenitor cell and microparticle mobilization by involvement of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</a></h2><p>Circulating microparticles (MPs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) correlate with endothelial dysfunction and contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In this context, we explored whether the angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist, , exerts a pharmacological control in the atherosclerotic process by the improvement of EPC mobilization and inhibitory effects on MP release and VEGF and SDF-1α levels in the hypertensive-hypercholesterolemic (HH) hamster model. The HH hamsters were treated with  (50mg/kg b.w/day administered by gavage) for 4 month (HHI). We analyzed MP/EPC infiltration in vascular wall before and after  administration as well as the endothelial function and expression of VEGF/SDF-1α in plasma and tissue and of molecular pathways activated by them. The results showed that treatment with  significantly increased EPC infiltration and decreased MP infiltration. The mechanisms underlying this response include the reduction/increase of a number of specific membrane receptors exposed by MPs (TF, P-Selectin, E-Selectin, PSGL-1, Rantes), respectively, by EPCs (β2-Integrins, α4β1-integrin), the augmentation of endothelium-mediated vasodilation and the reduction of protein expression of VEGF/SDF-1α followed by: (1) the diminishment of pro-inflammatory endothelial cytokines: VEGFR1, VEGFR2, CXCR4, Tie2, PIGF with role in EPC homing to sites of damaged endothelium; and (2) the increase of protein expression of COX-2, PGI2 synthase molecules with role in the improvement of arterial wall vasodilatation. In conclusion, the study underlines that  administration therapeutically improves/reduces EPC, respectively, MP mobilization and this action may be of salutary relevance contributing to its beneficial cardiovascular effects.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The left ventricular/ ratio was increased 43% in hearts from rats with untreated left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) versus control hearts (P < .05). However, there was no difference in either the left ventricular/ ratio (2.78 +/- 0.08 versus 2.81 +/- 0.20 mg/g; P = NS) or myocyte cross-sectional area in the AT1-blocker-treated versus untreated LVH hearts.

Furthermore, db/db mice and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice were used to investigate the effects of CA against DN in vivo.The results showed that CA activated Nrf2, inhibited NF-κB pathway and regulated related downstream genes in mGMC under HG condition. A 14-week treatment of mice with CA reduced water uptake and urine volume, attenuated diabetes-induced albuminuria, increased urine creatinine, and subsequently improved the glomerular sclerosis and mesangial expansion in db/db mice. Similarly, a 20-week oral administration of CA improved kidney damage in STZ-induced diabetic mice. In addition, CA inhibited the expression of profibrotic factors, such as TGF-β1, fibronectin and E-cadherin. Compared to , CA exerted better glucose lowering effect, and in kidney, CA was more potent to reduce fibronectin and E-cadherin expression. In all the animal experiment, CA did not lead to abnormal damages to other tissues.These findings suggest that CA is a safe compound which exerts the protective effects on diabetes-induced kidney complications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

All ARBs have high affinity for the AT receptor, expressed in various tissues, including smooth muscle cells, heart, kidney, and brain. Since activation of ATR, the target of these drugs, leads, among other effects, to vascular smooth muscle cell growth, proliferation and contraction, activation of fibroblasts, cardiac hypertrophy, aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex, thirst-fluid intake (hypervolemia), etc., the ARBs are nowadays one of the most useful cardiovascular drug classes used in clinical practice. However, significant differences in their pharmacological and clinical properties exist that may favor use of particular agents over others within the class, and, in fact, two of these drugs, candesartan and valsartan, continuously appear to distinguish themselves from the rest of the 'pack' in recent clinical trials.

Rats were made diabetic with streptozotocin for 5 or 12 weeks. In the final 3 weeks, rats were treated with vehicle,  (ARB) or +thiorphan (ARNI). Blood pressure, measured by telemetry in the 5-week group, was lowered identically by ARB and ARNI. The heart weight/tibia length ratio in 12-week diabetic animals was lower after ARNI compared with after ARB. Proteinuria and albuminuria were observed from 8 weeks of diabetes onwards. ARNI reduced proteinuria more strongly than ARB, and a similar trend was seen for albuminuria. Kidneys of ARNI-treated animals showed less severe segmental glomerulosclerosis than those of ARB-treated animals. After 12 weeks, no differences between ARNI- and ARB-treated animals were found regarding diuresis, natriuresis, plasma endothelin-1, vascular reactivity (acetylcholine response) or kidney sodium transporters. Only ARNI-treated rats displayed endothelin type B receptor-mediated vasodilation. In conclusion, ARNI reduces proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and heart weight in diabetic TGR(mREN2)27 rats more strongly than does ARB, and this occurs independently of blood pressure.© 2016 The Author(s). published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the Biochemical Society.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818100>Degradation of seventeen contaminants of emerging concern in municipal wastewater effluents by sonochemical advanced oxidation processes.</a></h2><p>The simultaneous degradation of seventeen emerging concern pollutants in effluent from the municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) of Bogotá-Colombia was studied using high frequency ultrasound (375 kHz). The considered compounds in the effluent corresponded to pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, carbamazepine, venlafaxine, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, valsartan, losartan, , sulfamethoxazole, clarithromycin, azithromycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, trimethoprim and clindamycin); cocaine and its major metabolite benzoylecgonine. Due to limitation of the MWTP for the pollutants elimination, ultrasound was applied to remove these compounds. Interestingly, ultrasonic physical action led to releasing of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole from suspended solids, whereas the chemical effects induced degradation of the rest of compounds. For the latter ones, an interesting correlation between the sonodegradation and arithmetic multiplication between hydrophobicity and concentration of pollutants was established. Afterwards, the sonochemical process was complemented with ferrous ions (sono-Fenton), ferrous ions plus light (sono-photo-Fenton) or ferrous ions plus light in presence of oxalic acid (sono-photo-Fenton/oxalic acid). Additionally, to clarify fundamental aspects of the different systems, individual treatments in distilled water of a model pollutant (valsartan) were performed. The complemented processes significantly enhanced all compounds degradation, following the order: sono-photo-Fenton/oxalic acid > sono-photo-Fenton ∼ sono-Fenton > sonochemistry. The Fe addition improved the pollutants elimination by generation of more hydroxyl radicals in the solution bulk. Meanwhile, oxalic acid avoided Fe precipitation favoring the iron catalytic cycle. Thus, the work demonstrates the high potentiality of the sono-photo-Fenton/oxalic acid system for the pollutants elimination in real-world wastewater matrices.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1R) blockers (ARBs) reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus by mostly unknown molecular mechanisms. To identify new antidiabetic mechanisms of ARBs, we studied the regulation of adiponectin by angiotensin II (Ang II) and different ARBs in murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes and obese Zucker rats. Adiponectin protein expression was markedly stimulated by Ang II (5 nmol/L), which was inhibited by blockade of the AT2R, and further enhanced by the ARB . -mediated adiponectin upregulation started beyond the concentrations needed for AT1R blockade and was also present in the absence of Ang II, implicating an AT1R-independent mechanism of action. Recently, certain ARBs (, telmisartan) were identified as ligands of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma. Telmisartan also stimulated adiponectin protein expression, whereas the non-PPARgamma-activating ARB eprosartan had no effect. Blockade of PPARgamma activation by the PPARgamma antagonist GW9662 markedly inhibited -induced adiponectin expression. Cognate mRNA levels of adiponectin were not affected by ARBs. Kinetic studies using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide showed that  prevented the cellular depletion of adiponectin protein. Finally, administration of  to obese Zucker rats improved insulin sensitivity and attenuated adiponectin serum depletion. The present study demonstrates that AT2R activation and certain ARBs induce adiponectin in adipocytes, which was associated with an improvement of parameters of insulin sensitivity in vivo. ARB-induced adiponectin stimulation is likely to be mediated via PPARgamma activation involving a post-transcriptional mechanism.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27146583>Evaluation of γ-cyclodextrin effect on permeation of lipophilic drugs: application of cellophane/fused octanol membrane.</a></h2><p>According to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System, oral bioavailability of drugs is determined by their aqueous solubility and the ability of the dissolved drug molecules to permeate lipophilic biological membranes. Similarly topical bioavailability of ophthalmic drugs is determined by their solubility in the aqueous tear fluid and their ability to permeate the lipophilic cornea. Enabling pharmaceutical excipients such as cyclodextrins can have profound effect on the drug bioavailability.

In this study, the permeation enhancing effect of γ-cyclodextrin (γCD) on saturated drug solutions containing hydrocortisone (HC),  (IBS), or telmisartan (TEL) was evaluated using cellophane and fused cellulose-octanol membranes in a conventional Franz diffusion cell system. The flux (J), the flux ratio (J) and the apparent permeability coefficients (P) demonstrate that γCD increases drug permeability. However, its efficacy depends on the drug properties.

It is a marker and predictor of cardiovascular disease. CRP possesses numerous cardiovascular effects (clotting, generation of oxygen radicals, increase in the expression of adhesion molecules and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, plaque destabilization) that could result in cardiovascular disease. This review describes the effects of various cardiovascular drugs on the levels of CRP in health and disease. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors (aspirin, rofecoxib, celecoxib), platelet aggregation inhibitors (clopidogrel, abciximab),  lowering agents (statins, ezetimibe, fenofibrate, niacin, diets), beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists and antioxidants (vitamin E), as well as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ramipril, captopril, fosinopril), reduce serum levels of CRP; while enalapril and trandolapril have not been shown to have the same effect. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (valsartan, , olmesartan, telmisartan) markedly reduce serum levels of CRP. The findings with other ARBs (losartan and candesartan) were inconsistent. Antidiabetic agents (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) reduce CRP levels, while insulin is ineffective. Calcium channel antagonists have variable effects on CRP levels. Hydrochlorothiazide and oral estrogen do not affect CRP. The CRP-lowering effect of statins is more pronounced than their  lowering effect and is not dependent on their hypolipemic activity. The effect of atorvastatin on CRP seems to be dose-dependent. CRP-lowering effect of statins is likely to contribute to the favorable outcome of statin therapy. The data suggest that  lowering agents, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, antidiabetic agents, antiinflammatory and antiplatelet agents, vitamin E, and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists lower serum or plasma levels of CRP, while vitamin C, oral estrogen and hydrochlorothiazide do not affect CRP levels.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20826135> enhances GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport in skeletal muscle cells.</a></h2><p>, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker has been reported to alleviate metabolic disorder in animal studies and human clinical trials.

As muscle glucose transport plays a major role in maintaining systemic glucose homeostasis, we investigated the effect of  on glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells.

In L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts,  caused a significant increase in glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface in a concentration-dependent manner. Valsartan, another angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker had no effect on either glucose uptake or GLUT4 translocation, implying that these actions on glucose transport are independent of angiotensin II receptor blockade. Moreover,  exerted these effects in an additive manner with insulin, but not with acute treatment for 3 h, suggesting that they may require the synthesis of new proteins. Finally, in insulin-resistant Zucker fatty rat,  (50 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks) significantly ameliorated insulin resistance without increasing  gain.

Hyperglycemia induces several pathological alterations which upregulate this system, accounting for overexpression of its downstream signaling molecules, amongst which angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone hold prime pathological notoriety. Although it is well known that elevated plasma levels of Ang II play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of type-II diabetic mellitus, by inducing and aggravating insulin resistance, it is not quite much known that it equally elevates the possibility/risk of development of diabetic complications. Also, amongst the various diabetic complications, the effects of Ang II upregulation are more widely acknowledged in studies concerning the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy; however, its role in exacerbating diabetic retinopathy has not received much attention. Ang II, indeed, plays a detrimental role in the progression of diabetic retinopathy by augmenting the principal events involved in its pathogenesis, namely oxidative stress, angiogenesis and inflammation. The utility of angiotensin receptor blockers has shown positive results in research studies and hence, might potentially provide a novel adjuvant therapy for treating this complication and preventing the associated vision-loss in diabetic patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The Shen-Yan-Fang-Shuai Formula (SYFSF) is a traditional Chinese formula composed of Astragali radix, ,  Baill, and four other herbs. It has been widely used as an effective treatment for DKD patients in China. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying SYFSF's renoprotection. In this study, we compared the protective effect of SYFSF to  on the histology and renal cells in type 2 DKD rat model and high-glucose (HG) cultured mesangial cells, respectively. We found that SYFSF could significantly decrease urinary albumin, cholesterol, and triglyceride. And a decrease in serum creatinine was also found in SYFSF-treated group compared with -treated rats. In addition, SYFSF inhibited the interstitial expansion and glomerulosclerosis in diabetic rats. Notably, SYFSF markedly downregulated the expression of MCP-1, TGF-1, collagen IV, and fibronectin in diabetic rat models and HG-induced mesangial cell models. The renoprotection was closely associated with a reduced expression of TNF- and phosphorylated NF-Bp65. Our study suggests that SYFSF may ameliorate diabetic kidney injury. The observed renoprotection is probably attributable to an inhibition of inflammatory response and extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation mediated by TNF-/NF-Bp65 signaling pathway.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643769>.</a></h2><p> is an angiotensin II receptor blocker used alone or in combination with other agents in the therapy of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy.  is associated with a low rate of transient serum aminotransferase elevations and has been linked to rare instances of acute  injury.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10764658>Blockade of angiotensin II type 1 receptor and not of endothelin receptor prevents hypertension and cardiovascular disease in transgenic (mREN2)27 rats via adrenocortical steroid-independent mechanisms.</a></h2><p>We investigated the role of angiotensin II (Ang II) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in transgenic (mREN2)27 rats, a model of the monogenic renin-dependent form of severe hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

After 4 weeks of treatment, during which BW and BP were measured weekly, animals were euthanized, and the heart, left ventricle, right ventricle, adrenal gland, brain, and kidney were weighed.

The tension responses of ET-free segments of the thoracic aorta to 5 x 10(-6) mmol/L phenylephrine, 60 mmol/L KCl, and cumulative doses of ET-1 were assessed. The density of ET-1 receptor subtypes in the aorta and vascular structural changes in the mesenteric arterioles (100 to 200 microm ID) were also measured with autoradiography and myography, respectively. Compared with all other groups, group I rats showed significantly (P<0.001) lower systolic BP (group I, 161+/-8 mm Hg; group P, 269+/-23 mm Hg; group B, 275+/-17 mm Hg; and group BMS, 254+/-21 mm Hg), left ventricular  (2.28+/-0.15 versus 3. 71+/-0.26, 3.38+/-0.27, and 3.96+/-0.51 mg/g BW, respectively), tension responses to vasoconstrictors, and normalized media thickness of the mesenteric arterioles (22.3+/-0.6 versus 25.3+/-0.5, 25.5+/-0.7, and 24.1+/-1.5 microm, respectively).

In humans, mutations in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) have been reported to cause the full-blown metabolic syndrome, and drugs that activate PPARgamma have proven to be effective agents for the prevention and treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Here we report that telmisartan, a structurally unique angiotensin II receptor antagonist used for the treatment of hypertension, can function as a partial agonist of PPARgamma; influence the expression of PPARgamma target genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism; and reduce glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels in rats fed a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. None of the other commercially available angiotensin II receptor antagonists appeared to activate PPARgamma when tested at concentrations typically achieved in plasma with conventional oral dosing. In contrast to ordinary antihypertensive and antidiabetic agents, molecules that can simultaneously block the angiotensin II receptor and activate PPARgamma have the potential to treat both hemodynamic and biochemical features of the metabolic syndrome and could provide unique opportunities for the prevention and treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in high-risk populations.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23949470>Angiotensin-(1-7) protects from experimental acute lung injury.</a></h2><p>Recently, recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 was shown to protect mice from acute lung injury, an effect attributed to reduced bioavailability of angiotensin II. Since angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 metabolizes angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1-7), we hypothesized that this effect is alternatively mediated by angiotensin-(1-7) and activation of its receptor(s).To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of intravenously infused angiotensin-(1-7) in three experimental models of acute lung injury.Animal research laboratory.Male Sprague-Dawley rats, Balb/c mice, and C57Bl6/J mice.Angiotensin-(1-7) was administered with ventilator- or acid aspiration-induced lung injury in mice or 30 minutes after oleic acid infusion in rats. In vitro, the effect of angiotensin-(1-7) on transendothelial electrical resistance of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells was analyzed.Infusion of angiotensin-(1-7) starting 30 minutes after oleic acid administration protected rats from acute lung injury as evident by reduced lung edema, myeloperoxidase activity, histological lung injury score, and pulmonary vascular resistance while systemic arterial pressure was stabilized. Such effects were largely reproduced by the nonpeptidic angiotensin-(1-7) analog AVE0991. Infusion of angiotensin-(1-7) was equally protective in murine models of ventilator- or acid aspiration-induced lung injury. In the oleic acid model, the two distinct angiotensin-(1-7) receptor blockers A779 and D-Pro-angiotensin-(1-7) reversed the normalizing effects of angiotensin-(1-7) on systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics, but only D-Pro-angiotensin-(1-7) blocked the protection from lung edema and protein leak, whereas A779 restored the infiltration of neutrophils. Rats were also protected from acute lung injury by the AT1 antagonist ; however, this effect was again blocked by A779 and D-Pro-angiotensin-(1-7). In vitro, angiotensin-(1-7) protected pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells from thrombin-induced  failure, yet D-Pro-angiotensin-(1-7) or NO synthase inhibition blocked this effect.Angiotensin-(1-7) or its analogs attenuate the key features of acute lung injury and may present a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this disease.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21296052> increased PPARγ activity in vivo in white adipose tissue of atherosclerotic mice and improved adipose tissue dysfunction.</a></h2><p>The effect of the PPARγ agonistic action of an AT(1) receptor blocker, , on adipose tissue dysfunction was explored using atherosclerotic model mice.

Studies have reported that  (Irbe), an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) widely prescribed for CKD, activates hepatic PPARα. However, Irbe's renal PPARα-activating effects and the role of PPARα signalling in the renoprotective effects of Irbe are unknown. Herein, these aspects were investigated in healthy kidneys of wild-type (WT) and Ppara-null (KO) mice and in the murine protein-overload nephropathy (PON) model respectively. The results were compared with those of losartan (Los), another ARB that does not activate PPARα. PPARα and its target gene expression were significantly increased only in the kidneys of Irbe-treated WT mice and not in KO or Los-treated mice, suggesting that the renal PPARα-activating effect was Irbe-specific. Irbe-treated-PON-WT mice exhibited decreased urine protein excretion, tubular injury, oxidative stress (OS), and pro-inflammatory and apoptosis-stimulating responses, and they exhibited maintenance of fatty acid . Furthermore, the expression of PPARα and that of its target mRNAs encoding proteins involved in OS, pro-inflammatory responses, apoptosis and fatty acid  was maintained upon Irbe treatment. These renoprotective effects of Irbe were reversed by the PPARα antagonist MK886 and were not detected in Irbe-treated-PON-KO mice.

Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have anti-inflammatory properties via inhibition of angiotensin II (Ang II)/Ang II type I receptor axis (AT1). Inhibition of the classical RAS pathway is also involved in upregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which activates the Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway to counteract inflammatory signaling and acts as a partner of the amino acid transporter, BAT-1, to absorb tryptophan for regulation of microbiota-gut-brain axis. In this study, we determined the effects of ARB  on stress-induced intestinal inflammation. C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 2-week intermittent restraint stress. They were orally treated during the stress with either vehicle, 3 or 10 mg/kg/day . Restraint stress resulted in colon inflammation with higher histological damage scores, increased expression of Nox4, TLR-4 and IL1-β, accumulation of reactive  species (ROS), and activation of the ACE-angiotensin II-AT1 receptor axis. Stress also downregulated intestinal amino acid transporter, ACE2/BAT-1, and activity of intestinal mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), resulting in decrease in α-defensins, changes in intestinal microbial contents, and perturbation of tryptophan metabolism with activation of the kynurenine pathway.

The initial reduction in SBP and albuminuria independently correlated with cardiovascular protection: HR per 5 mmHg SBP reduction 0.97 (95% CI 0.94-0.99) and HR per decrement log albuminuria 0.87 (95% CI 0.76-0.99). Across all SBP categories at Month 6, a progressively lower cardiovascular risk was observed with a lower albuminuria level. This was particularly evident in patients who reached the guideline recommended SBP target of ≤130 mmHg.The SBP and albuminuria response to ARB therapy is variable and discordant. Therapies intervening in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with the aim of improving cardiovascular outcomes may therefore require a dual approach targeting both blood pressure and albuminuria.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29538199>Hypertensive crisis with 2 target organ impairment induced by glycyrrhizin: A case report.</a></h2><p>Glycyrrhizin is the main active component of licorice. Licorice and glycyrrhizin induced hypertension has been widely reported, yet licorice and glycyrrhizin induced hypertensive crisis has been rarely known.The case of this report was a 47-year-old woman, who took 225 mg of glycyrrhizin daily for 3 years due to primary biliary cholangitis. She was found to have a dramatically elevated blood pressure of about 230/110 mmHg without a history of hypertension and was referred to the emergency department.Hypokalemia, hypertensive retinopathy, and nephropathy were found during the following work-up.

Intravenous sodium nitroprusside was used during the first few days. Nifedipine and  were taken after discharge, and the dosage was reduced gradually under supervision.She stopped all the anti-hypertensive drugs 6 months since glycyrrhizin was stopped. Her blood pressure was about 110/60 mmHg after repetitive measurement.

The main cause of stroke is atherosclerosis, and the most common risk factor for atherosclerosis is hypertension. Therefore, antihypertensive treatments are recommended for the prevention of stroke. Three angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), telmisartan,  and candesartan, inhibit the expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), which is one of the pleiotropic effects of these drugs. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is the ligand of RAGE, and has been recently identified as a lethal mediator of severe sepsis. HMGB1 is an intracellular protein, which acts as an inflammatory cytokine when released into the extracellular milieu. Extracellular HMGB1 causes multiple organ failure and contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertension, , diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and stroke. This is the first review of the literature evaluating the potential of three ARBs for the HMGB1-RAGE axis on stroke therapy, including prevention and acute treatment. This review covers clinical and experimental studies conducted between 1976 and 2013. We propose that ARBs, which inhibit the HMGB1/RAGE axis, may offer a novel option for prevention and acute treatment of stroke. However, additional clinical studies are necessary to verify the efficacy of ARBs.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31021475>Dendrobium candidum protects against diabetic kidney lesions through regulating vascular endothelial growth factor, Glucose Transporter 1, and connective tissue growth factor expression in rats.</a></h2><p> (DM) remains a great health problem with approximate 30% of patients with DM eventually suffering from diabetic nephropathy. The search for exogenous protective factors has recently received wide attention. The current study aimed to investigate the protective effects of Dendrobium candidum (DC) on kidneys in diabetic rats. Initially, streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were established and randomly divided into the model group, DC group (0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 g/kg) and  group (17.5 mg/kg). The biochemical indexes, pathological changes, and the expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), GLUT-1, and CTGF were examined.

Therefore, AT1R blockers (ARBs) have been widely used as therapeutic drugs for these diseases. Recent basic research and clinical studies have resulted in the discovery of interesting phenomena associated with AT1R function. For example, ligand-independent activation of AT1R by mechanical stress and agonistic autoantibodies, as well as via receptor mutations, has been shown to decrease the inverse agonistic efficacy of ARBs, though the molecular mechanisms of such phenomena had remained elusive until recently. Furthermore, although AT1R is believed to exist as a monomer, recent studies have demonstrated that AT1R can homodimerize and heterodimerize with other G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), altering the receptor signaling properties. Therefore, formation of both AT1R homodimers and AT1R-GPCR heterodimer may be involved in the pathogenesis of human disease states, such as atherosclerosis and preeclampsia. Finally, biased AT1R ligands that can preferentially activate the β-arrestin-mediated signaling pathway have been discovered. Such β-arrestin-biased AT1R ligands may be better therapeutic drugs for cardiovascular diseases. New findings on AT1R described herein could provide a conceptual framework for application of ARBs in the treatment of diseases, as well as for novel drug development. Since AT1R is an extensively studied member of the GPCR superfamily encoded in the human genome, this review is relevant for understanding the functions of other members of this superfamily.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we investigated roles of Apelin in aortic remodeling and fibrosis in rats with transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to TAC and then randomized to daily deliver Apelin-13 (50μg/kg) or angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1) blocker  (50mg/kg) for 4 weeks. Pressure overload resulted in myocardial hypertrophy, systolic dysfunction, aortic remodeling and adventitial fibrosis with reduced levels of Apelin in ascending aortas of rat after TAC compared with sham-operated group. These changes were associated with marked increases in levels of miRNA-122, TGFβ1, CTGF, NFAT5, LGR4, and β-catenin. More importantly, Apelin and  treatment strikingly prevented TAC-mediated aortic remodeling and adventitial fibrosis in pressure overloaded rats by blocking AT1 receptor and miRNA-122 levels and repressing activation of the CTGF-NFAT5 and LGR4-β-catenin signaling. In cultured primary rat adventitial fibroblasts, exposure to angiotensin II (100nmolL) led to significant increases in cellular migration and levels of TGFβ1, CTGF, NFAT5, LGR4 and β-catenin, which were effectively reversed by pre-treatment with Apelin (100nmolL) and miRNA-122 inhibitor (50nmolL). In conclusion, Apelin counterregulated against TAC-mediated ascending aortic remodeling and angiotensin II-induced promotion of cellular migration by blocking AT1 receptor and miRNA-122 levels and preventing activation of the TGFβ1-CTGF-NFAT5 and LGR4-β-catenin signaling, ultimately contributing to attenuation of aortic adventitial fibrosis.

Molecular mechanisms underlying their formation and signaling are unclear. We investigated the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS), Rho kinase, and lipid rafts in microparticle formation and examined their functional significance in endothelial cells (ECs).Microparticle formation from angiotensin II (Ang II)-stimulated ECs and apolipoprotein E(-/-) mice was assessed by annexin V or by CD144 staining and electron microscopy.

Ang II-stimulated effects were inhibited by  (Ang II receptor type I blocker) and fasudil (Rho kinase inhibitor). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin and nystatin, which disrupt lipid rafts/caveolae, blocked microparticle release.

The levels of oxidative stress indicators, such as nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA), were evaluated in renal tissue homogenates using the automatic biochemical analyzer. The inhibitory effect of gliquidone on renal interstitial fibrosis and its association with Notch / Snail1 signaling pathway in diabetic nephropathy was investigated using molecular biological techniques.It was found that low-, medium- and high-dose gliquidone improved the mice's general health condition, such as mental status, fur condition, eating, and drinking. Gliquidone reduced the  and the kidney  / ratio of mice. Gliquidone improved the kidney function, indicated by reductions in urinary protein, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine and triglyceride. Gliquidone treatment increased levels of nitric oxide and superoxide dismutase, but decreased level of malondialdehyde. The expression of Jagged1/Notch1/hes1/Snail1/α-SMA decreased, while the expression of E-cadherin increased in gliquidone-treated kidneys. High dose gliquidone showed the best effect, one that was similar to that of the positive control drug .Taken together, our results suggested that gliquidone can ameliorate the diabetic symptoms of diabetic nephropathy through inhibiting Notch / Snail1 signaling pathway, improving anti -oxidative response and delaying renal interstitial fibrosis.

In this study, we demonstrated that Ser994 of IR is a direct substrate for TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a new member of the IKK-related kinase family. TBK1 was found to co-immunoprecipitate with the IR, in the liver of OZR supporting an in vivo association between the IR and TBK1. Interestingly, a marked increase in the association between TBK1 and the IR was found in the liver of OZR as well as in other models of insulin resistance/diabetes. Taken together, these findings suggest that TBK1 could be involved in the insulin resistance mechanism related with IR Ser994 phosphorylation in a genetic model of diabetes.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'inflammation', 'obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19929980> has no short-term effect on insulin resistance in hypertensive patients with additional cardiometabolic risk factors (i-RESPOND).</a></h2><p>Intervention studies have shown that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) may reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Evidence indicate that the angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers can suppress atherogenesis, but the exact mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. The study was undertaken to investigate the potential effects and molecular mechanisms of an angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker  on atherogenesis in high cholesterol-diet apolipoprotein E knock-out mice.Adult male apolipoprotein E knock-out mice were given normal diet or high cholesterol-diet and randomized to receive no treatment or  10 mg kg(-1) d(-1) for 12 weeks. The apolipoprotein E knock-out mice with high cholesterol-diet were associated with a marked increase in atherosclerotic lesion area, plasma lipid and angiotensin II levels, as well as the expressions of angiotensin type 1 receptor in the aorta. High cholesterol-diet feeding increases the activity of NADPH oxidase subunits (p47(phox) and Rac), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, janus kinase 2, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, nuclear factor-kappaB and the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 6, monocyte chemoattactant protein-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in the aortas. These changes were suppressed in mice that were treated with  10 mg kg(-1) d(-1), with no significant change in systolic blood pressure and plasma lipid levels.The results suggest that  can attenuate atherosclerosis, and this effect is partly related to the inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammatory signal transduction pathways which eventually leads to the decrease in the expression of inflammatory cytokines.Copyright  2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However currently clinical laboratory and histopathological tests do not provide region-specific and accurate biomarkers for early detection of kidney disease. The present study was conducted to identify sensitive biomarkers for early detection and progression of tubulo-interstitial nephropathy in aristolochic acid I-induced rats at weeks 4, 8 and 12. Biomarkers were validated using aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) rats at week 24, adenine-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD) rats and CKD patients. Compared with control rats, AAN rats showed anemia, increased serum urea and creatinine, progressive renal interstitial fibrosis, activation of nuclear factor-kappa B, and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant, and pro-fibrotic proteins at weeks 8 and 12. However, no significant difference was found at week 4. Metabolomics identified 12-ketodeoxycholic acid, taurochenodesoxycholic acid, LPC(15:0) and docosahexaenoic acid as biomarkers for early detection of tubulo-interstitial nephropathy. With prolonging aristolochic acid I exposure, LPE(20:2), cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid and LPC(17:0) were identified as biomarkers for progression from early to advanced AAN and lysoPE(22:5), indoxyl sulfate, uric acid and creatinine as biomarkers of advanced AAN.

However, ARBs may cause a low incidence of headache, upper respiratory infection, back pain, muscle cramps, fatigue, dizziness, and many other side effects. In some cases, such toxicity is associated with pharmacokinetic alterations.The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system plays an important role in a lot of clinically important pharmacokinetic drug interactions.

Angiotensin II-receptor blockers (ARBs) are effective antihypertensive drugs that have been reported to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) to differing extents, with favorable effects on glucose metabolism and the incidence of new-onset diabetes. Among the ARBs, telmisartan is a partial activator of PPARgamma,  is a weak partial activator, and olmesartan has no effect on PPARgamma activation.The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects on glucose homeostasis of combining rosuvastatin with ARBs of varying PPARgamma-activating potency in Greek adults with impaired fasting glucose, mixed dyslipidemia, and stage 1 hypertension.This was a 24-week, randomized, open-label study. Inclusion criteria were impaired fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (100-125 mg/dL [5.6-6.9 mmol/L]), mixed dyslipidemia (LDL-C >160 mg/dL [4.14 mmol/L] and triglycerides >150 mg/dL [1.69 mmol/L]), and stage 1 hypertension (systolic blood pressure 140-159 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure 90-99 mm Hg).

The primary end point was change in the following indices of glucose metabolism after 6 months of treatment: FPG, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), HOMA of beta-cell function (HOMA-B), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)). Secondary end points included changes in anthropometric variables, blood pressure, serum lipids, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Tolerability was monitored throughout the study.After the 12-week dietary intervention, 151 white patients (78 female, 73 male) met the inclusion criteria and were randomized to receive RT (n = 52), RI (n = 48), or RO (n = 51).

At 6 months, the RT group had a 29% decrease in HOMA-IR (from a median [range] of 2.6 [0.6-6.6] to 1.8 [0.5-5.1]), the RI group had a 16% increase (from 2.5 [0.5-6.2] to 2.9 [0.5-8.1]), and the RO group had a 14% increase (from 2.4 [0.5-7.9] to 2.7 [0.5-5.2]) (all, P < 0.05 vs baseline). The improvement in the RT group was statistically significant compared with the RI group (P < 0.01) and the RO group (P < 0.05). The changes from baseline in FPG and HbA(1c) were not significant in any group. Fasting serum insulin decreased by 21% in the RT group (from 10.4 [2.4-28.1] to 8.2 [2.4-18.8] microU/mL), whereas it increased by 12% in the RI group (from 9.1 [2.0-26.5] to 10.2 [2.0-25.2] microU/mL) and by 8% in the RO group (from 10.1 [2.0-29.6] to 10.9 [2.0-19.1] microU/mL) (all, P < 0.05 vs baseline). Again, there was a significant difference between the RT group and the RI group (P < 0.01) and RO group (P < 0.05). Levels of hs-CRP decreased by 44% in the RT group (from 2.2 [0.3-7.9] to 1.2 [0.4-7.0] mg/L), by 12% in the RI group (from 2.2 [0.3-12.3] to 1.9 [0.2-11.4] mg/L), and by 22% in the RO group (from 2.1 [0.7-4.0] to 1.7 [0.7-6.2] mg/L). The difference was statistically significant for the RT group compared with baseline and with the RI and RO groups (all comparisons, P < 0.05). Blood pressure was significantly reduced from baseline in all 3 groups, with no significant differences between groups. No serious adverse events were reported during the study, nor were there any clinically significant elevations in aminotransferases or creatine kinase.In this small, randomized, open-label study, the RT combination had favorable effects on HOMA-IR, fasting serum insulin, and hs-CRP compared with the RI and RO combinations in Greek adults with impaired fasting glucose, mixed hyperlipidemia, and stage 1 hypertension.Copyright  2010 Excerpta Medica Inc.

Fifteen compounds, commonly present in HWW, were considered: acetaminophen, diclofenac, carbamazepine, venlafaxine, loratadine, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, valsartan, , sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, clarithromycin, azithromycin, erythromycin and clindamycin. Initially, HWW was characterized in terms of global parameters and the pharmaceuticals content. HWW contained a moderate amount of organic matter (i.e., total organic carbon: 131.56 mg L (C)) mainly associated to biodegradable components. However, the most of pharmaceuticals were found at levels upper than their predicted no effect concentration (PNEC). Then, a conventional biological treatment was applied to the HWW. After 36 h, such process mainly removed biodegradable substances, but had a limited action on the pharmaceuticals. The resultant biotreated water was submitted to the sonochemical process (375 kHz and 88 W L, 1.5 h), which due to its chemical (i.e., radical attacks) and physical (i.e., suspended solids disaggregation) effects induced a considerable pharmaceuticals degradation (pondered removal: 58.82%), demonstrating the complementarity of the proposed combination. Afterwards, Fe (5 ppm) and UVC light (4 W) were added to the sonochemical system (generating sono-photo-Fenton process), which significantly increased up to 82.86% the pondered pharmaceuticals removal. Subsequently, to understand fundamental aspects of the pharmaceuticals degradations, a model compound (norfloxacin) in distilled water was treated by sonochemical system, sono-photo-Fenton process and their sub-systems (i.e., sono-Fenton and UVC alone). This allowed proving the hydroxyl radical action in sonochemical treatment, plus the contribution of Fenton reaction and direct photodegradation in the pharmaceuticals removal by sono-photo-Fenton. Finally, it was found that 91.13% of the initial pharmaceuticals load in HWW was removed by the biological/sono-photo-Fenton combination.

Further, we sought to elucidate the correlation between VEGF level and certain clinical parameters, such as albumin excretion rate (AER), before and after treatment with angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker.We recruited 166 type 2 diabetic patients at various stages of diabetic nephropathy (DN) and 46 healthy control subjects for a cross-sectional study. We recruited another 42 hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria for a longitudinal study involving a 6-month  treatment protocol. Urinary VEGF (uVEGF) levels were determined using ELISA.In the cross-sectional study, hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients who received RAS inhibitor presented lower uVEGF levels than those who did not receive the RAS inhibitor. Statistical analysis indicated that uVEGF level was independently correlated with the AER. In the longitudinal study involving the 6-month  treatment, we demonstrated that uVEGF levels decreased significantly in patients who achieved a 50% AER reduction (remission group, n=32). In contrast, uVEGF levels remained unchanged in patients who did not exhibit a 50% AER reduction (nonremission group, n=10). Furthermore, the change in uVEGF was significantly correlated with the change in AER (r=0.65, P<0.01) before and after 6 months of  treatment. This result held true even after we had adjusted for the decrease in average blood pressure.The protective effect of the RAS inhibitor in DN patients is associated with the suppression of VEGF. Accordingly, it may be possible to use uVEGF as a marker of DN progression. We suggest that uVEGF may be an important target for therapeutic intervention in the context of DN.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7594426>Early and late haemodynamic and morphological effects of angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor blockade during genetic hypertension development.</a></h2><p>To investigate the haemodynamic and morphological effects resulting from the chronic administration to young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) of a new selective angiotensin II subtype 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, SR 47436/BMS-186295 (SR/BMS) both during and after the treatment period.SR/BMS (60 mg/kg per day, orally) or distilled water was chronically (from 4 to 20 weeks of age) administered to SHR. At age 8, 14, 20 and 28 weeks the effects of SR/BMS on the systemic and regional haemodynamic (radioactive microsphere technique) and the cardiac and vascular morphological parameters (automatic image analysis) were investigated.SR/BMS limited genetic hypertension development and opposed the age-related rises in total peripheral and regional vascular resistances. Simultaneously, it limited the age-related increases in heart , left ventricular cross-sectional area and collagen content. Age-related increases in aortic media thickness and amount of collagen were also significantly reduced, whereas aortic compliance was increased. Eight weeks after withdrawal of treatment the antihypertensive effect of SR/BMS, although attenuated, and the limitation of cardiac and vascular remodelling, persisted.Early AT1 receptor blockade in SHR opposes genetic hypertension development during the treatment period and persistently after its interruption. Prevention of genetic hypertension development during the treatment period can be accounted for by the limitation of the age-related development of the haemodynamic and morphological abnormalities, whereas the persistence of the antihypertensive effect observed after drug withdrawal is due mainly to a maintained prevention of the development of the cardiovascular morphological alterations.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28434933>Assessing the Eligibility Criteria in Phase III Randomized Controlled Trials of Drug Therapy in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction: The Critical Play-Off Between a "Pure" Patient Phenotype and the Generalizability of Trial Findings.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effect of the different eligibility criteria used by phase III clinical studies in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) on patient selection, phenotype, and survival.We applied the key eligibility criteria of 7 phase III HFpEF studies (Digitalis Investigation Group Ancillary, Candesartan in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure and Preserved Left-Ventricular Ejection Fraction, Perindopril in Elderly People With Chronic Heart Failure,  in Heart Failure With Preserved Systolic Function, Japanese Diastolic Heart Failure, Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist, and Efficacy and Safety of LCZ696 Compared to Valsartan, on Morbidity and Mortality in Heart Failure Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction [PARAGON-HF; ongoing]) to a typical and well-characterized HFpEF population (n = 557) seen in modern European cardiological practice.

Recent clinical trials have shown the added benefits of ARBs in hypertensive patients (reduction in left ventricular hypertrophy, improvement in diastolic function, decrease in ventricular arrhythmias, reduction in microalbuminuria, and improvement in renal function), and cardioprotective effect in patients with heart failure. Several large long-term studies are in progress to assess the beneficial effects of ARBs on cardiac hypertrophy, renal function, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients with or without diabetes mellitus, and the value of these drugs in patients with heart disease and diabetic nephropathy. The ARBs specifically block the interaction of angiotensin II at the AT1 receptor, thereby relaxing smooth muscle, increasing salt and water excretion, reducing plasma volume, and decreasing cellular hypertrophy. These agents exert their blood pressure-lowering effect mainly by reducing peripheral vascular resistance usually without a rise in heart rate. Most of the commercially available ARBs control blood pressure for 24 h after once daily dosing. Sustained efficacy of blood pressure control, without any evidence of tachyphylaxis, has been demonstrated after long-term administration (3 years) of some of the ARBs. The efficacy of ARBs is similar to that of thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium channel blockers in patients with similar degree of hypertension. Higher daily doses, dietary salt restriction, and concomitant diuretic or ACE inhibitor administration amplify the antihypertensive effect of ARBs. The ARBs have a low incidence of adverse effects (headache, upper respiratory infection, back pain, muscle cramps, fatigue and dizziness), even in the elderly patients. After the approval of losartan, five other ARBs (candesartan cilexetil, eprosartan, , telmisartan, and valsartan) and three combinations with hydrochlorothiazide (, losartan and valsartan) have been approved as antihypertensive agents, and some 28 compounds are in various stages of development. The ARBs are non-peptide compounds with varied structures; some (candesartan, losartan, , and valsartan) have a common tetrazolo-biphenyl structure. Except for , all active ARBs have a carboxylic acid group. Candesartan cilexetil is a prodrug, while losartan has a metabolite (EXP3174) which is more active than the parent drug. No other metabolites of ARBs contribute significantly to the antihypertensive effect. The variation in the molecular structure of the ARBs results in differences in the binding affinity to the receptor and pharmacokinetic profiles. The differences observed in  solubility, absorption/distribution, plasma protein binding, bioavailability, biotransformation, plasma half-life, and systemic elimination influence the time of onset, duration of action, and efficacy of the ARBs. On the basis of the daily mg dose, the antihypertensive potency of the ARBs follows the sequence: candesartan cilexetil > telmisartan approximately = losartan >  approximately = valsartan > eprosartan. After oral administration, the ARBs are rapidly absorbed (time for peak plasma levels = 0.5-4 h) but they have a wide range of bioavailability (from a low of 13% for eprosartan to a high of 60-80% for ); food does not influence the bioavailability, except for valsartan (a reduction of 40-50%) and eprosartan (increase). A limited dose-peak plasma levels/areas under the plasma level-time curve proportionality is observed for some of the ARBs. Most of these drugs have high plasma protein binding (95-100%);  has the lowest binding among the group (90%). The steady-state volumes of distribution vary from a low of 9 L (candesartan) to a high of 500 L (telmisartan).

CYP induces granulosa cell apoptosis and oxidative stress.  (IRB) is a unique ARB with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ) agonistic activity. As PPAR-ɣ activation exerts anti-inflammatory effects and reduces ROS production, IRB may further reduce inflammatory chemokine expression and suppress apoptotic cell death. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of IRB on the development of CYP-induced ovarian damage. Rats were divided into four groups: control group, IRB group (100 mg/kg, orally), CYP group (100 mg/kg, i.p. single injection), and IRB+CYP group (IRB administered 9 days before and 6 days after CYP administration). Rats sacrificed on day 16 of experiment; estradiol (E2), FSH, and TNF-α levels were estimated in serum. Reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and caspase-3 activities, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and IL-10 levels were determined in ovarian tissues. Protein expressions of p53, caspase-3, Ki-67, and Rad-51 were estimated by immunohistochemical and Western blot techniques. CYP produced ovarian damage as indicated from the decline in serum E2; elevation in FSH; unbalance in tissue oxidative stress parameters; increase in MPO, TNF-α levels, caspase-3 activity/expression, p53, and Rad-51 expression; and decrease in IL-10 contents, without effect on Ki-67. On the other hand, IRB, significantly reduced the toxic effects of CYP as indicted from normalization of E2, FSH, oxidative stress, apoptotic, and inflammatory mediators. These data were further supported by histopathological studies. Thus, co-administration of IRB may be promising in alleviating the ovarian toxic effects of CYP.© 2015 Société Française de Pharmacologie et de Thérapeutique.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27643439>Angiotensin receptors and β-catenin regulate brain endothelial integrity in malaria.</a></h2><p>Cerebral malaria is characterized by cytoadhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (Pf-iRBCs) to endothelial cells in the brain, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and cerebral microhemorrhages. No available antimalarial drugs specifically target the endothelial disruptions underlying this complication, which is responsible for the majority of malaria-associated deaths. Here, we have demonstrated that ruptured Pf-iRBCs induce activation of β-catenin, leading to disruption of inter-endothelial cell junctions in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). Inhibition of β-catenin-induced TCF/LEF transcription in the nucleus of HBMECs prevented the disruption of endothelial junctions, confirming that β-catenin is a key mediator of P. falciparum adverse effects on endothelial integrity. Blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) or stimulation of the type 2 receptor (AT2) abrogated Pf-iRBC-induced activation of β-catenin and prevented the disruption of HBMEC monolayers. In a mouse model of cerebral malaria, modulation of angiotensin II receptors produced similar effects, leading to protection against cerebral malaria, reduced cerebral hemorrhages, and increased survival. In contrast, AT2-deficient mice were more susceptible to cerebral malaria. The interrelation of the β-catenin and the angiotensin II signaling  opens immediate host-targeted therapeutic possibilities for cerebral malaria and other diseases in which brain endothelial integrity is compromised.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function', 'barrier intergrity', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19329412>Analysis of published economic evaluations of angiotensin receptor blockers.</a></h2><p>In this study we reviewed the published literature on the economic evaluation of the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for the treatment of hypertension, either primary or due to .An extensive literature review was undertaken.

The most common method undertaken was cost-consequence analysis (52.94%) followed by cost-effectiveness analysis (32.35%). In most cases, costs and benefits results were not synthesised. Results failed to show a clear advantage in favour of specific therapy, as the outcomes suffered from heterogeneity, referred to specific circumstances and were rather difficult to compare. For different treatment comparators, all the analyses demonstrated an improved life expectancy and a cost-saving choice. The robustness of results was tested with a series of sensitivity analyses, which showed a statistically significant result in each case.The evidence from this review suggests that the available ARBs represent a cost-saving and cost-effective treatment compared with other conventional treatment options for patients with hypertension and associated conditions.

This study presented a novel high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based data-mining strategy to fast and comprehensive metabolite identification of combination drugs in human. The model drug combination was verapamil- (VER-IRB), which is widely used in clinic to treat hypertension. First, mass defect filter (MDF), as a targeted data mining tool, worked effectively except for those metabolites with similar MDF values. Second, the accurate mass-based background subtraction (BS), as an untargeted data-mining tool, was able to recover all relevant metabolites of VER-IRB from the full-scan MS dataset except for trace metabolites buried in the background noise and/or combined drug-related signals. Third, the novel ring double bond (RDB; valence values of elements in structure) filter, could show rich structural information in more sensitive full-scan MS chromatograms; however, it had a low capability to remove background noise and was difficult to differentiate the metabolites with RDB coverage. Fourth, an integrated strategy, i.e., untargeted BS followed by RDB, was effective for metabolite identification of VER and IRB, which have different RDB values. Majority of matrix signals were firstly removed using BS. Metabolite ions for each parent drug were then isolated from remaining background matrix and combined drug-related signals by imposing of preset RDB values/ranges around the parent drug and selected core substructures. In parallel, MDF was used to recover potential metabolites with similar RDB. As a result, a total of 74 metabolites were found for VER-IRB in human plasma and urine, among which ten metabolites have not been previously reported in human. The results demonstrated that the combination of accurate mass-based multiple data-mining techniques, i.e., untargeted background subtraction followed by ring double bond filtering in parallel with targeted mass defect filtering, can be a valuable tool for rapid metabolite profiling of combination drug.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies have demonstrated that angiotensin II (AngII) plays a key role in mediating cell hypertrophy. The aim of our work was to explore the role of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in mediating AngII-induced tubular cell hypertrophy in vivoandin vitro.In an in vivo study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: control rats, diabetic rats and diabetic rats treated with  (IRB). The index of kidney hypertrophy (kidney /, KW/BW), glomerular tuft area (AG), glomerular tuft volume (VG) and proximal tubular area (AT) were determined. Renal expression for CTGF was detected by immunohistochemical staining. In an in vitro study, the influence of CTGF antisense oligonucleotide (CTGF AS) on AngII-induced CTGF expression and cell hypertrophy was also investigated.In an in vivo study, diabetic rats showed a significant increase of KW/BW, AG, VG, and AT from week 1 onwards compared to normal control, which could be significantly inhibited by using IRB. Furthermore, there was a significantly increasing expression of CTGF in both glomeruli and tubuli in diabetic rats compared to control, and the extent of CTGF expression closely correlated with the severity of renal hypertrophy. Treatment with IRB could markedly inhibit the renal expression of CTGF. In an in vitro study, AngII stimulated the expression of CTGF mRNA and CTGF protein. AngII significantly increased the total protein content in HK2 cells, which was markedly inhibited by co-treatment with CTGF AS. The average cellular diameter determined by scanning electronic microscope showed that the increase of cell size induced by AngII could be significantly inhibited by CTGF AS. Furthermore, flow cytometer study showed that AngII arrested the cell cycle in the G0-G1 phase, which was significantly reversed by treatment with CTGF AS.Our data provide both in vivo and in vitroevidence that CTGF is involved in mediating AngII-induced renal hypertrophy.2006 S.

The (P)RR is an accessory protein of vacuolar-type H⁺-ATPase (V-ATPase) and is required for V-ATPase integrity. In addition, in collecting duct cells, prorenin-induced activation of Erk depends on V-ATPase activity. However, whether prorenin binding to the (P)RR directly regulates V-ATPase activity is as yet unknown. Here, we studied the effect of prorenin on plasma membrane V-ATPase activity in Madin-Darby canine kidney clone 11 (MDCK.C11) cells, which resemble intercalated cells of the collecting duct. Prorenin increased V-ATPase activity at low nanomolar concentrations, and the V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1, but not the angiotensin II type 1 and 2 receptor blockers  and PD-123319, prevented this. Increased, but not basal, V-ATPase activity was abolished by small interfering RNA depletion of the (P)RR. Unexpectedly, the putative peptidic (P)RR blocker handle region peptide also increased V-ATPase activity in a (P)RR-dependent manner. Finally, [Arg⁸]-vasopressin-stimulated V-ATPase activity and cAMP production were also abolished by (P)RR depletion.

For most drugs, the underlying mechanism of drug-induced myopathy remains unclear. Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) mediate L-lactic acid transport, and inhibition of MCTs may potentially lead to perturbation of L-lactic acid accumulation and muscular disorders. Therefore, we hypothesized that L-lactic acid transport may be involved in the development of drug-induced myopathy. The aim of this study was to assess the inhibitory potential of 24 acidic drugs on L-lactic acid transport using breast cancer cell lines Hs578T and MDA-MB-231, which selectively express MCT1 and MCT4, respectively.The influx transport of L-lactic acid was minimally inhibited by all drugs tested. The efflux transport was next examined: loratadine (IC50: 10 and 61 µM) and atorvastatin (IC50: 78 and 41 µM) demonstrated the greatest potency for inhibition of L-lactic acid efflux by MCT1 and MCT4, respectively. Acidic drugs including fluvastatin, cerivastatin, simvastatin acid, lovastatin acid,  and losartan exhibited weak inhibitory potency on L-lactic acid efflux.Our results suggest that some acidic drugs, such as loratadine and atorvastatin, can inhibit the efflux transport of L-lactic acid.This inhibition may cause an accumulation of intracellular L-lactic acid leading to acidification and muscular disorders.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25901452>Production of β -cyclodextrin from pH and thermo stable Cyclodextrin Glycosyl Transferase, obtained from Arthrobacter mysorens and its evaluation as a drug carrier for .</a></h2><p>Cyclodextrins (CDs) are carrier molecules produced by cyclization of α-1,4-glucans by Cyclodextrin Glycosyl Transferase (CGTase).

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were found to be more effective than the other traditional agents in reducing the onset of clinical proteinuria in individuals with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and incipient nephropathy. However, small trials on patients with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy failed to demonstrate a specific renoprotective role for this class of drugs.

In a second step, a target quantitative method based on LC coupled to tandem MS was applied for selected pollutants identified in the previous screening. The behaviour of the compounds under anaerobic conditions was studied estimating the degradation efficiency and distribution of compounds between both sludge phases.  and benzoylecgonine seemed to be notably degraded in both phases of the sludge. Venlafaxine showed a significant concentration decrease in the aqueous phase in parallel to an increase in the solid phase.

Nevertheless, it is unknown to which degree effects of these compounds on individual inflammatory mediators, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), are comparable. On the basis of structural and functional differences, it was hypothesized that ACEI and ARB differentially regulate MMP activity. In a randomized, prospective crossover trial, the effect of an ACEI (fosinopril; 20 mg/d) and of an ARB (; 150 mg/d) on MMP activity was evaluated. Ten hypertensive patients with glomerulonephritis and normal or mildly reduced creatinine clearance were studied. MMP activity and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP) levels were analyzed in serum and urine: without therapy, with ACEI, with ARB, and with both agents combined. Treatment periods continued for 6 wk separated by periods of 4 wk each without therapy. Untreated patients with glomerulonephritis displayed distinctively higher serum levels of MMP-2 but much lower MMP-1/-8/-9 concentrations compared with healthy control subjects. Immunohistology of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in kidney biopsy specimen was accordingly. However, these patients excreted higher amounts of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in urine than healthy control subjects, possibly reflecting ongoing glomerular . In patients with glomerulonephritis, ACEI significantly reduced overall MMP serum activity to 25%, whereas ARB did not show any effect. Activities of MMP-1/-2/-8/-9 were also significantly inhibited by fosinopril but not by . Levels of TIMP-1/-2 remained unaffected. In conclusion, ACEI and ARB differentially regulate MMP activity, which may ultimately have consequences in certain types of MMP-dependent glomerulonephritis.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16915030>Angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonists induce human in-vitro  through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activation.</a></h2><p>In clonal animal cells, certain angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma).

The current study was carried out to assess the protective effect of XKP in spontaneous diabetic db/db mice and the underlying mechanism whereby XKP regulates TGF-/Smad pathway. Male C57BLKS/J db/db mice, 12 weeks old, were randomly divided into 3 groups: the model group, 17.5 mg/kg -treated group (IST group), and 8 g/kg XKP-treated group (XKP group), while age-matched db/m mice were selected as a control group. After 8 weeks of administration, serum and urea samples were collected from mice for biochemical tests, while the kidneys were removed for histological analysis. The expression of TGF-/Smad pathway-related mRNA and protein were measured by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. Treatment with XKP significantly improved renal function and attenuated the pathological change of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in renal histopathology. Furthermore, the overexpression of TGF-1, Smad3, and p-Smad3 was inhibited, as well as the reduction of Smad7 and SIP1 was weakened by XKP.

However, the direct effects of hypercholesterolemia on the myocardium and mechanisms are not completely understood. It has been demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) ligand agonists attenuate cardiac hypertrophy through anti-inflammatory effects. The present study investigated the effects of PPARgamma agonists on hypercholesterolemia-dependent, renin-angiotensin-system-related cardiac hypertrophy. The findings showed that left ventricular hypertrophy, eminent cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and lipid deposits in myocardium were observed in the rats fed a cholesterol-rich diet for 6 months, while these characteristic pathological alterations and the increase in angiotensin II (ANG II) level and over-expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) in the left ventricular tissues induced by the cholesterol-rich diet were significantly suppressed to equal extents by rosiglitazone and . In contrast, expression of angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT(2)R) was upregulated by these two drugs. In addition, lipid metabolism was markedly improved. The above findings suggest that the cardioprotection of the PPARgamma agonist against cardiac hypertrophy evoked by hypercholesterolemia in rats is mediated partially by the improvement of lipid profile, the reduction of ANG II level in the local tissue along with the downregulation of AT(1)R expression, and upregulation of AT(2)R expression.2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10703884>No vasoactive role of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor in normotensive Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>To investigate the vasoactive consequences of angiotensin II type 2 receptor stimulation in vivo.Three consecutive 10 min intravenous infusions of angiotensin (Ang) II (100, 300 and 1000 ng/kg per min) were given to 20 pentobarbitone-anaesthetized normotensive Wistar rats ( 330+/-6 g, mean +/- SEM).

Ang II activation of AT1 receptors triggers G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kgamma) and its downstream pathways.

Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) that specifically block the AT(1) receptor offer the potential to prevent or delay progression to end-stage renal disease independently of reductions in blood pressure. Proteinuria--an early and sensitive marker for progressive renal dysfunction--is reduced by ARB use in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy and microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria. Retrospective analysis of data available from early trials has confirmed this finding and has shown that albuminuria reduction is associated with lessening of cardiovascular risk. The ARB telmisartan is equivalent to enalapril in preventing glomerular filtration rate decline, and equivalent to valsartan in reducing proteinuria. Telmisartan is more effective than conventional therapy in lowering the risk of transition to overt nephropathy in hypertensive and normotensive patients. An additive effect has been seen in smaller studies when telmisartan has been added to lisinopril therapy, and high-dose telmisartan reduces albuminuria better than low-dose telmisartan. Similar data were obtained with other ARBs such as candesartan, losartan, valsartan, or .

Yet RAS blockers have only limited beneficial effects on progression of DR in clinical trials. The natriuretic peptide system offsets RAS, so that enhancing the activity of this system on top of RAS blockade might be beneficial. Neprilysin has an important role in the degradation of natriuretic peptides. Therefore, we hypothesize that dual angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibition (ARNI) may outperform angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in protection against DR.

Treatment with vehicle,  (ARB), or ARB combined with the neprilysin inhibitor thiorphan (+thiorphan [ARNI]) occurred during the final 3 weeks. Retinal cell death, gliosis, and capillary loss were evaluated. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses were performed to quantify the retinal level of inflammatory cell markers.Both ARB- and ARNI-treated groups showed similarly reduced retinal apoptotic cell death, gliosis, and capillary loss compared to the vehicle-treated group in the 5-week study.

Consequently, they are expected to generate transformation products (TPs) during wastewater treatment and in surface water (SW) receiving WWTP effluent. In this work, degradation experiments for these five pharmaceuticals have been carried out with SW and WWTP activated sludge under laboratory-controlled aerobic conditions to identify their transformation products by liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF MS). Initially, 22 pharmaceutical TPs were tentatively identified. A retrospective analysis was performed in effluent wastewater (EWW) and SW samples. All parent compounds as well as several TPs were found in some of the selected EWW and SW samples. Additionally, valsartan and 3 TPs were also detected by searching for common fragments in these waters. It is important to highlight that some TPs, such as O-desmethyl-venlafaxine and an oxidized gemfibrozil TP, were more frequently found than their corresponding parent compounds. On the basis of these results, it would be recommendable to include these TPs (at least those found in EWW and SW samples analyzed) in monitoring programs in order to gain a more realistic understanding of the impact of pharmaceuticals on water quality.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Growth hormone (GH) administration to these children can stimulate their growth, but it plays an important role in glomerulosclerosis. Thus these children would take a risk to use it to improve their growth. This study was designed to investigate the effect of GH on the kidney of rats with adriamycin-induced nephropathy (AN) and its mechanism, and to observe the renoprotective effect of angiotensin II (AngII) receptor antagonist, , in GH-treated AN rats.Rats were divided into the following groups: normal control rats, AN rats, GH-treated AN rats and GH plus -treated AN rats. There were 8 developing male SD rats (120-130 g) in each group. Urinary protein was measured at weeks 3, 6 and 9. Blood pressure, serum creatinine, BUN, albumin, cholesterol, triglyceride, as well as ACE activity and AngII concentration of the kidney were detected at the end of the study. Renal pathological changes were evaluated also. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the protein expressions of TGF beta(1), collagen IV and fibronectin in glomeruli.Glomerular sclerosis score of GH-treated AN rats (49.4 +/- 9.8) was significantly higher than that of AN rats (12.8 +/- 5.5, P < 0.01), and this score of GH-treated AN rats plus  (26.2 +/- 7.5) was significantly lower than the score of GH-treated AN rats (P < 0.01).

The present study was thus designed to examine the effect of an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist,  on renal function, oxidative stress and nitric oxide (NO) release in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg) in rats.

Renal function was assessed by creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine clearance and urea clearance. Oxidative stress was measured by renal malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. We also measured renal nitrite levels.At the end of the 8th week, diabetic rats exhibited renal dysfunction as evidenced by reduced creatinine and urea clearance along with enhanced albumin excretion rate as compared with control rats. Biochemical analysis of kidneys revealed a marked increase in oxidative stress demonstrated by increased  peroxidation and decreased activities of key antioxidant enzymes, GSH, SOD and catalase in diabetic rats. NO release was also significantly higher in diabetic rats than controls. Chronic treatment with  in diabetic rats significantly attenuated both renal dysfunction and oxidative stress along with increased NO levels as compared with untreated diabetic rats. The kidneys of diabetic rats showed morphological changes such as hyaline casts, glomerular thickening and moderate interstitial fibrosis and arteriolopathy, whereas  administration markedly prevented diabetic-induced renal morphological alterations.The present study suggests that oxidative stress/nitrosative stress is increased in the diabetic kidney and AT1 receptor blockade can prevent these changes.

Exogenous administration of Ang II did not affect I/R injury or PPC mediated protection. Nonetheless inhibition of endogenously synthesized Ang II protected against I/R induced cardiac damage yet did not block or augment the protective effects of PPC. The administration of AT1 antagonist did not alleviate I/R induced damage. Interestingly it abrogated PPC induced cardiac protection in isolated rat hearts. Finally, PPC induced protection and blockade of locally produced Ang II involved enhanced activation of ERK1/2 and Akt components of the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) pathway.This study demonstrate a novel role of endogenously produced Ang II in mediating I/R injury and highlights the significance of AT1 signaling in PPC mediated cardiac protection in isolated rodents hearts ex vivo.

Levels of NPs higher than certain cutoffs are often used as inclusion criteria in clinical trials of HFpEF to increase the likelihood that patients have HF and to select patients at higher risk for events. Whether treatments have a differential effect on outcomes across the spectrum of NP levels is unclear.The TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist Trial) trial randomized patients with HFpEF and either prior hospitalization for HF or elevated natriuretic peptide levels (B-type NP [BNP] ≥100 pg/ml or N-terminal proBNP ≥360 pg/ml) to spironolactone or placebo. Baseline BNP (n = 430) or N-terminal proBNP (n = 257) levels were available in 687 patients enrolled from the Americas in the elevated-NP stratum of TOPCAT.Higher levels of NPs were independently associated with an increased risk for TOPCAT's primary endpoint of cardiovascular mortality, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF when analyzed either continuously or grouped by terciles, adjusting for region of enrollment, age, sex, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, renal function, body mass index, and heart rate. There was a significant interaction between the effect of spironolactone and baseline NP terciles for the primary outcome (p = 0.017), with greater benefit of the drug in the lower compared with higher NP terciles.Similar to the effects of  in the I-PRESERVE ( in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction) trial, a greater benefit of spironolactone was observed in the group with lower levels of NPs and overall risk in TOPCAT. Elevated NPs in HFpEF identify patients at higher risk for events but who may be less responsive to treatment.

Huangkui capsule (HKC), an extract from AM, has been proved clinically effective in improving renal inflammation and glomerular injury in CKD. However, the mechanisms of HKC are still not fully understood.Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α/γ dual agonists have the potential to be used as therapeutic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy (DN). This study evaluated the function of Huangkui capsule (HKC), an extract from Abelmoschus manihot (L.) medic (AM), as a dual agonist for PPARα/γ and investigated its anti-DN effects in a DN rat model.ChIP and reporter gene assays were performed and the expression of PPARα/γ target genes was monitored to examine the ability of HKC to activate PPARα/γ. DN was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats via unilateral nephrectomy and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. HKC was administered to the diabetic nephropathy rats at three different doses: high dose HKC (300mg/kg/d); middle dose HKC (175mg/kg/d); and low dose HKC (75mg/kg/d).  (4mg/kg/d body weight) was used as a positive control. Following 12 weeks' treatment, we measured general status, renal morphological appearance, proteinuria, blood biochemical parameters, and glomerular morphological changes. The expression of collagen IV, TGFβ, TNFα and IL-6 in renal tissue was evaluated. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in renal tissue was also analyzed.HKC enhanced the transcriptional activity of PPARα and PPARγ in cultured cells, livers and kidneys of DN rats, and it reduced serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels and fat in livers of DN rats. Furthermore, HKC reduced the expressions of inflammatory genes in kidneys of DN rats. Strikingly, HKC reduced ER stress and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation in the liver and kidney of DN rats and subsequently improved renal injury.Our results show that HKC improved lipid  disorders by activating PPARα/γ and attenuating ER stress. HKC could dose-dependently ameliorate renal inflammation and glomerular injury in DN rats. These results suggest that HKC has potential as an anti-DN agent for the treatment of DN in humans.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We therefore tested the hypothesis that tubulointerstitial fibrosis involves EMT driven by ET-1.Transgenic TG[mRen2]27 (TGRen2) rats developing fulminant angiotensin II-dependent hypertension with prominent cardiovascular and renal damage were submitted to drug treatments targeted to ET-1 and/or angiotensin II receptor or left untreated (controls). Expressional changes of E-cadherin and α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) were examined as markers of renal EMT. In human kidney HK-2 proximal tubular cells expressing the ETB receptor subtype, the effects of ET-1 with or without ET-1 antagonists were also investigated. The occurrence of renal fibrosis was associated with EMT in control TGRen2 rats, as evidenced by decreased E-cadherin and increased αSMA expression.  and the mixed ET-1 receptor antagonist bosentan prevented these changes in a blood pressure-independent fashion (P < 0.001 for both versus controls). In HK-2 cells ET-1 blunted E-cadherin expression, increased αSMA expression (both P < 0.01), collagen synthesis, and metalloproteinase activity (P < 0.005, all versus untreated cells).

We used different complementary techniques to gain a clear picture of the involved protonation and complexation equilibria. The low solubility in water of the ligands and of the formed metal complexes prevented the use of water as solvent, so we had to perform the measurements in mixed methanol-water solvents. Further, we studied the related equilibria with Zn for evaluating a potential interference of this essential metal ion, largely present in biological fluids. Our study provided a strong evaluation of the formed complexes and of the relative stability constants. The binding of both metal ions takes place through the tetrazole moiety except for the Zn- system. In this last case, NMR measurements gave evidence of a tautomeric equilibrium involving the imidazole ring and the aliphatic chain. The estimated complexation model, and the related stability constants, allowed a speciation study in human plasma, based on a number of simplifying assumptions, which remarked that both drugs, Losartan and , could exert a chelating action, scavenging non-negligible amounts of Cu from the organism.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Pancreatic blood flow was markedly increased by pravastatin (P<0.001), captopril (P<0.05) and  (P<0.01). Pancreatic islet blood flow was significantly and preferentially enhanced after the administration of captopril (P<0.01),  (P<0.01) and pravastatin (P<0.001).

However, while  previously inhibited tumour growth in this model, in the current experiments  failed to affect tumour burden. Subsequent analysis showed a cancer-cell specific upregulation of the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) in -insensitive compared to -sensitive tumours. The upregulation of AT1R was associated with an increase in proliferation and VEGF expression by cancer cells. While animals bearing -sensitive tumours showed a marked decrease in the number of proliferating cells in the liver and VEGF-expressing infiltrating cells in the tumour following AT1R treatment, these were unchanged by treatment in animals bearing -insensitive (high AT1R expressing) tumours.Although the results do not support increased efficacy of combined treatment, they provide intriguing evidence of the importance of RAS expression in determining patient response and tumour growth potential and suggest that components of the RAS could be used as biomarkers to aid in patient selection.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12498264>Optimization and validation of a capillary zone electrophoretic method for the analysis of several angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists.</a></h2><p>We optimized a capillary zone electrophoretic method for separation of six angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists (ARA-IIs): candesartan, eprosartan, , losartan potassium, telmisartan, and valsartan.

Paradoxically, in HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFREF), a high  mass index (BMI) appears to be beneficial. Approximately 50% of HF patients have a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFPEF). However, there are few data regarding the relationship between BMI and outcomes in HFPEF.Baseline characteristics and cardiovascular outcomes were assessed in the 4109 patients (mean age, 72 years; mean follow-up, 49.5 months) in the  in HF with Preserved Ejection Fraction (I-PRESERVE) trial. Based on the BMI distribution, 5 BMI categories were defined: <23.5, 23.5 to 26.4, 26.5 to 30.9, 31 to 34.9, and ≥35 kg/m(2). Most patients (71%) had a BMI ≥26.5, 21% had a BMI between 23.5 and 26.4, and 8% had a BMI <23.5 kg/m(2). Patients with higher BMI were younger, more often women, and more likely to have hypertension and diabetes and higher left ventricular ejection fraction. Patients with BMI of 26.5 to 30.9 kg/m(2) had the lowest rate for the primary composite outcome (death or cardiovascular hospitalization) and were used as reference group. After adjustment for 21 risk variables including age, sex, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, the hazard ratio for the primary outcome was increased in patients with BMI <23.5 (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.56; P=0.019) and in those with BMI ≥35 kg/m(2) (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.52; P=0.011) compared with the referent group. A similar relationship was found for all-cause mortality and for HF hospitalization.Obesity is common in HFPEF patients and is accompanied by multiple differences in clinical characteristics. Independent of other key prognostic variables, there was a U-shaped relationship, with the greatest rate of adverse outcomes in the lowest and highest BMI categories.http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Olmesartan and mycophenolic acid (CellCept) are drugs that are capable of increasing inflammation and enteropathy in some individuals and, if not recognized, can lead to chronic diarrhea. It is this type of drug-induced diarrhea that is the focus of this review.A summary of our findings (recent and earlier published) as well as a review of published works from other centers were conducted.There is increasing evidence that olmesartan use is associated with enteropathy in a small number of individuals who use angiotensin receptor II blockers, and that this enteropathy is characterized by severe diarrhea capable of inducing severe dehydration and, in some instances, failure of organs such as the kidney. Typical patient demographics are Caucasian individuals who are older (>50 years old) and obese or overweight prior to weight loss. Prolonged exposure to olmesartan use for 1-2 years is typical, although case reports of  and valsartan have been reported as well. Discontinuing olmesartan leads to improvement of symptoms; however, the period for healing is variable, with some patients requiring steroid therapy and even prolonged parental nutrition support. In addition, many histological features of olmesartan-associated enteropathy are also present in celiac disease, including villi shortening and lymphocyte infiltration. Other drug-associated enteropathies have also been reported with mycophenolate mofetil used in transplantation.Of the drug-associated enteropathies discussed in this review, olmesartan can generate the most severe symptoms, albeit quite rare. Therefore, with patients who present with severe diarrhea and weight loss, one should consider olmesartan-associated enteropathy. In addition, many of the features associated with olmesartan-associated enteropathy are also found in celiac disease enteropathy; as such, one should review any celiac disease diagnosis for any use of olmesartan at the time of diagnosis.© 2015 S.

Traditional Chinese medicine has been widely used in treating patients with diabetic nephropathy in China. However, the detailed mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine remain unclear. Yiqi Yangyin Huayu Tongluo formula (ZY formula) is a traditional Chinese medicinal formula. Here, we demonstrated kidney protective effect of ZY formula on the rats with diabetic nephropathy. The therapeutic effect of ZY formula on the diabetic nephropathy was almost the same as that of , which proved to have excellent curative effects on diabetic nephropathy. We also demonstrated the mechanism of ZY formula effect on the diabetic nephropathy. First, we validated that the activation of ROS-JNK signaling pathway in diabetic rats could be reduced by ZY. Furthermore, collagen I expression could be downregulated by ZY formula treatment.

In the present study, all-female juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed to environmentally-realistic concentrations of a mixture of nonsteroidal pharmaceuticals for 42 days, and the effects on plasma levels of sex-steroids and the expression of genes encoding key proteins involved in ovarian development were assessed. Paracetamol, carbamazepine, diclofenac,  and naproxen were selected, as these have been detected in the Meuse River in Belgium. Fish were exposed to three concentrations of the mixture including the environmental concentration, 10- and 100-times the environmental concentration. Plasma levels of sex-steroid hormones, particularly 11-ketotestosterone, increased in a concentration-dependent way in exposed females. In addition, some key genes involved in ovarian steroidogenesis were significantly overexpressed after 7 days of exposure, such as key genes involved in the maintenance of the ovary. The steady-state mRNA level of genes implicated in germ cell fate were especially affected, such as that of foxl3 which increased by 5 fold at the highest concentration of the mixture. In conclusion, this study highlights that combined occurrence of common pharmaceutical drugs at concentrations present in surface water environments may act as endocrine-disrupting compounds in rainbow trout.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

An integrated CV risk management approach is being adopted: aggressive blood pressure (BP) control is important in patients with high CVD risk, and well-tolerated antihypertensive agents with protective benefits beyond BP lowering are advantageous. The renin-angiotensin system is integral to blood pressure control and is well established in the pathophysiology of CVD. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are highly efficacious, persistent, well-tolerated antihypertensive agents, with additional benefits in comorbid hypertension, CV pathologies, end-organ damage, and, in diabetes, diabetic nephropathy or metabolic syndrome.

Wistar-Kyoto rats served as controls. The pathological changes were investigated by microscopy. Immunofluorescence was performed to evaluate the co-expression of CD31 and fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1). FSP1 and α-SMA expressions were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. EndMT was also studied in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) that had been exposed to high glucose (HG) levels.Increased interstitial fibrosis was detected in the DM group. Double labeling revealed CD31 expression in FSP1-positive cells in the DM group, and this expression was diminished by Irb treatment (P<0.05). In vitro, we found that HG stimulated angiotensin II synthesis in HAECs. When HAECs were exposed to HG, some of the cells acquired a spindle-shaped morphology and demonstrated a loss of CD31 labeling, which was attenuated by Irb treatment. FSP1 and α-SMA mRNA and protein expression levels were markedly upregulated in diabetic rats compared to controls, and their expressions were inhibited by Irb treatment (P<0.05).The results provide the novel insight that an angiotensin II receptor blocker might prevent diabetic cardiomyopathy by abrogating EndMT in diabetic rats.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Hypercaloric diet increased blood glucose, impaired glucose tolerance test, and increased BP in pregnant rats, fulfilling criteria for GDM. Both drugs decreased impaired GTT and relative hyperglycemia. Metformin had no effect on BP but prevented  increase. In isolated aortas,  and metformin decreased vasoconstriction only of non-pregnant hypercaloric diet fed animals. Results support angiotensin II/ ATR involvement in BP and glucose homeostasis disturbances observed in present GDM model.

Aortic constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS) activity was determined by measuring the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline. Vascular responses to acetylcholine were determined by isometric tension studies.Whereas systolic blood pressure (SBP) was significantly increased in SHR compared with WKY, no differences were observed in SBP between SHR-I and WKY. In SHR compared with WKY, we found significantly greater NADH/NADPH-driven O2(.-) production, similar cNOS-mediated NO production and an impaired vasodilation in response to acetylcholine.

The NOCTURNE study, a multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) using our recently developed information and communication technology (ICT) nocturnal home BP monitoring (HBPM) device, was performed to compare the nocturnal HBP-lowering effects of differential ARB-based combination therapies in 411 Japanese patients with nocturnal hypertension (HT).Methods and Results:Patients with nocturnal BP ≥120/70 mmHg at baseline even under ARB therapy (100 mg  daily) were enrolled. The ARB/CCB combination therapy ( 100 mg+amlodipine 5 mg) achieved a significantly greater reduction in nocturnal home systolic BP (primary endpoint) than the ARB/diuretic combination (daily  100 mg+trichlormethiazide 1 mg) (-14.4 vs. -10.5 mmHg, P<0.0001), independently of urinary sodium excretion and/or nocturnal BP dipping status. However, the change in nocturnal home systolic BP was comparable among the post-hoc subgroups with higher salt sensitivity (, chronic kidney disease, and elderly patients).This is the first RCT demonstrating the feasibility of clinical assessment of nocturnal BP by ICT-nocturnal HBPM. The ARB/CCB combination was shown to be superior to ARB/diuretic in patients with uncontrolled nocturnal HT independently of sodium intake, despite the similar impact of the 2 combinations in patients with higher salt sensitivity.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19627007>[Effect of ginsenoside Rgl on the expression of TNF-alpha and MCP-1 in rats with diabetic nephropathy].</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects of Ginsenoside Rgl on proteinuria and the expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in rats with diabetic nephropathy (DN).The DN rat model was established by injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 65 mg/kg) in abdominal cavity. Forty Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: normal group, DN group, Ginsenoside Rgl treatment group and  treatment group. The blood glucose was monitored routinely. Twenty-four hours urine protein and serum creatine were measured the day before the rats were killed when the eight weeks of treatments had been completed. The renal pathological and podocyte changes were evaluated. Immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed to examine the protein expression levels of MCP-1 and TNF-alpha, respectively. The mRNA of TNF-alpha and MCP-1 were reverse transcribed and quantified by real-time PCR.The DN rats had increased volume of renal glomerulus, thickened basement membrane, and increased mesenterium mass, as well as some inflammatory cells in renal glomerulus. The number of potocyte decreased significantly in the DN group compared with the normal group (P<0.01). Compared with the DN group, the basement membrane became thinning and the number of podocyte increased in the two treatment groups (P<0.05). The rats in the DN group and the two treatment groups had significantly higher levels of twenty-four hour urine protein, serum creatine, serum glucose, serum MCP-1 and TNF-alpha than the normal rats (P<0.05). The rats in the treatment groups had lower levels of twenty-four hours urine protein and serum creatine than the rats in the DN group (P<0.05). But the serum glucose had little changes (P>0.05). There was no difference between the two treatment groups. Immunohistochemisty, ELISA and real-time PCR results indicated that the expression levels of MCP-1 and TNF-alpha in the rats in the DN group and the two treatment groups were significantly higher than those in the normal group (P<0.05). The rats in the treatment groups had lower levels of expression of MCP-1 and TNF-alpha than those in the DN group (P<0.05).

Our previous studies demonstrated that administration of a subpressor dose of angiotensin (Ang) II sensitizes subsequent Ang II-elicited hypertension. The present study tested whether high-fat diet (HFD) feeding also sensitizes the Ang II-elicited hypertensive response and whether HFD-induced sensitization is mediated by an increase in renin-angiotensin system activity and inflammatory mechanisms in the brain. HFD did not increase baseline blood pressure, but enhanced the hypertensive response to Ang II compared with a normal-fat diet. The sensitization produced by the HFD was abolished by concomitant central infusions of either a tumor necrosis factor-α synthesis inhibitor, pentoxifylline, an Ang II type 1 receptor blocker, , or an inhibitor of microglial activation, minocycline. Furthermore, central pretreatment with tumor necrosis factor-α mimicked the sensitizing action of a central subpressor dose of Ang II, whereas central pentoxifylline or minocycline abolished this Ang II-induced sensitization. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of lamina terminalis tissue indicated that HFD feeding, central tumor necrosis factor-α, or a central subpressor dose of Ang II upregulated mRNA expression of several components of the renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines, whereas inhibition of Ang II type 1 receptor and of inflammation reversed these changes. The results suggest that HFD-induced sensitization of Ang II-elicited hypertension is mediated by upregulation of the brain renin-angiotensin system and of central proinflammatory cytokines.© 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'inflammation', 'metabolism', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26268636>Efficacy and safety of two single-pill fixed-dose combinations of angiotensin II receptor blockers/calcium channel blockers in hypertensive patients (EXAMINER study).</a></h2><p>There is some controversy regarding which single-pill fixed-dose combinations of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are effective at reducing blood pressure (BP).Sixty hypertensive patients who received a single-pill fixed-dose combination of valsartan 80 mg/day and amlodipine 5 mg/day were enrolled (UMIN Registration 000013460).

Rats were treated with either DOX (2.5 mg/kg i.p., 3 times/week) for 2 weeks, and (or) IRB (40 mg/kg, daily) for 3 weeks. IRB prohibited nephrotoxicity induced by DOX, which was evident by the increase in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels and histopathological changes. IRB improved DOX-induced alterations in oxidative status by diminishing lipid peroxidation and upregulating the antioxidant enzymes. Also, upon DOX treatment, the renal expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and caspase-3 were significantly increased; IRB diminished DOX-induced alterations in these parameters. Moreover, DOX significantly decreased the expression level of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Meanwhile, DOX induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  that cross talked with AMPK.

Aliskiren monotherapy or combination therapy was generally well tolerated over short- and longer-term study durations in large, randomized clinical trials. Clinical trials to evaluate the effects of aliskiren on clinical outcomes, including renoprotective and cardioprotective effects, are currently ongoing.

A previous study revealed that rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) have an enhanced hypertensive response to subsequent angiotensin II administration that is mediated at least, in part, by increased activity of brain renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines. This study tested whether leptin mediates this HFD-induced sensitization of angiotensin II-elicited hypertension by interacting with brain renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokine mechanisms. Rats fed an HFD for 3 weeks had significant increases in white adipose tissue mass, plasma leptin levels, and mRNA expression of leptin and its receptors in the lamina terminalis and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Central infusion of a leptin receptor antagonist during HFD feeding abolished HFD sensitization of angiotensin II-elicited hypertension. Furthermore, central infusion of leptin mimicked the sensitizing action of HFD. Concomitant central infusions of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist , the tumor necrosis factor-α synthesis inhibitor pentoxifylline, or the inhibitor of microglial activation minocycline prevented the sensitization produced by central infusion of leptin. RT-PCR analysis indicated that either HFD or leptin administration upregulated mRNA expression of several components of the renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines in the lamina terminalis and paraventricular nucleus. The leptin antagonist and the inhibitors of angiotensin II type 1 receptor, tumor necrosis factor-α synthesis, and microglial activation all reversed the expression of these genes. The results suggest that HFD-induced sensitization of angiotensin II-elicited hypertension is mediated by leptin through upregulation of central renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines.© 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'inflammation', 'metabolism', 'obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29753370>Effects of Different Doses of  Combined With Spironolactone on Urinary Albumin Excretion Rate in Elderly Patients With Early Type 2 Diabetic Nephropathy.</a></h2><p>There is a lack of research on the effect of low dose of angiotensin receptor blockers combined with spironolactone, and the effect of high dose of angiotensin receptor blockers alone on the urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) in elderly patients with early type 2 diabetic nephropathy (DN).We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel-controlled study that included 244 elderly patients with early DN and mild-to-moderate essential hypertension.

Wild-type (C57BL/6J), ApoE-/-, AT1-/-, and ApoE-/--AT1-/- mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 7 weeks. In contrast to wild-type and AT1-/- mice, this treatment led to severe atherosclerotic lesion formation in the aortic sinus and the aorta (oil red O staining) and to an impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation (organ chamber experiments with isolated aortic segments) in ApoE-/- mice. In the age-matched ApoE-/--AT1-/- littermates, development of diet-induced endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerotic lesion formation was profoundly inhibited. Concomitantly, aortic release of superoxide radicals was increased 2-fold in ApoE-/- mice compared with wild-type animals, whereas aortic superoxide production was normalized in ApoE-/--AT1-/- mice (L-012 chemiluminescence). There were no significant differences in plasma cholesterol levels between ApoE-/- and ApoE-/--AT1-/- animals.

It is unclear whether these effects are mediated via subtype 1 receptors of Ang II, because these receptors are thought to mediate vasoconstriction. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (euglycemic clamp technique) and leg muscle blood flow (plethysmography) were measured in nine healthy male volunteers (mean age, 24 +/- 2 yr) on three occasions using a double-blind, placebo-controlled study design.

From 10% to 30% of the adult population in industrialized countries has MetSyndr, which effectively predicts the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and CV disease. Because of the complex etiology of MetSyndr, a multi-targeted, integrated therapeutic approach is required to simultaneously treat high BP, obesity, lipid disorders and T2D (if present), to fully protect CV, cerebrovascular and renal systems. If lifestyle modification ( control, diet, exercise, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol intake) is ineffective, pharmaco-theraphy should be added to treat simultaneously the lipid- and non-lipid CV risk factors. Patients with HTN and MetSyndr should be started on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, unless contraindicated. The ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce the odds of developing new onset T2D and also decrease albuminuria. The ACE inhibitors provide cardioprotective and renoprotective benefits beyond their effect on BP; they also improve IR. The ARBs are renoprotective in addition to being cardioprotective. Long-acting calcium channel blockers are also recommended in hypertensive patients with MetSyndr; these drugs also improve IR. Thiazides (at low doses) and selected ss-blockers can be given to patients with HTN and MetSyndr. Celiprolol in combination with diuretics has a favorable effect on glucose tolerance and IR in patients with HTN and MetSyndr, and spironolactone added to ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy provides additional reno- and CV protective benefits in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Carvedilol, a ss-blocker with vasodilating properties, added to ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, is effective in preventing worsening of microalbuminuria in patients with HTN and MetSyndr; it also improves IR and glycemic control. Most patients eventually require two or more antihypertensive drugs to reach BP goal. It is recommended that therapy in patients whose BP is more than 20/10 mm Hg above target at diagnosis be initiated with a combination of antihypertensive drugs, administered either as individual drugs or as fixed-dose formulations. Treatment with fixed-dose combinations, such as  + hydrochlorothiazide provides good BP control in more than two-thirds of hypertensive patients with MetSyndr. Lipid and BP targets are reached in a high percent of patients with HTN and CV disease treated with a combination of amlodipine + atorvastatin.

An analytical method based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MSMS) was developed and validated for use in routine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). The method includes 21 antihypertensive drugs or active metabolites from the groups beta blockers (n=5), calcium antagonists (n=5), angiotensin II receptor antagonists (n=4), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (n=3) and diuretics (n = 3), in addition to one α1-selective alpha blocker.A 200 µL serum sample was handled automatically using a pipetting robot. Protein precipitation was performed with 600 µL of 1% formic acid in acetonitrile (v:v) and phospholipid removal was carried out using a Waters OSTRO™ 96-well plate. After evaporation and reconstitution the eluent was injected thrice with different inlet and mass spectrometric methods to cover the different physico-chemical properties of the drugs and the variations in therapeutic concentration ranges between drugs. Acquity UPLC BEH C18 (2.1x50mm, 1.7 µm) column equipped with a corresponding pre-column was used for chromatographic separation. For every analyte an isotopically labelled analogue served as internal standard, except for lisinopril where enalaprilat-d5 was used.Accuracies were in the range of -13.7 to 13.2% and intra-day and inter-day precisions in the range of 1.1 to 10.5%. The linearity within the calibration ranges expressed as coefficient of determination was higher than 0.995 for all compounds. Matrix effects and recovery efficiencies were within acceptable limits. The limits of quantitation varied from 0.02 to 10.7 µg/L. The stability of the drugs in serum at different conditions was tested. Diltiazem was not stable at 4-8 °C with up to 23.5 % loss after six days. Degradation of atenolol, , bendroflumethiazide, hydrochlorothiazide and diltiazem was observed when stored at 30 °C.

Angiotensin II-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK and p38MAPK were assessed by Western blot analysis. c-fos mRNA expression by angiotensin II was determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in the absence and presence of PD98059, selective inhibitor of ERK1/2-dependent pathways and SB202190, selective p38MAPK inhibitor.Angiotensin II increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK, but not JNK. Responses were significantly increased in SHR compared with WKY. , AT1 receptor antagonist, but not PD123319, AT2 receptor blocker, abolished angiotensin II-induced effects. PP2, selective Src inhibitor, decreased angiotensin II-mediated activation of MAP kinases. Angiotensin II increased c-fos mRNA expression in SHR and had a small stimulatory effect in WKY. These actions were inhibited by PD98059, whereas SB202190 had no effect.Angiotensin II-induced activation of vascular ERK1/2 and p38MAPK is increased in SHR. These effects are mediated via AT1 receptors, which activate Src-dependent pathways. Overexpression of c-fos mRNA in SHR is due to ERK1/2-dependent, p38MAPK-independent pathways.

Direct comparison of different antihypertensive treatments on atherosclerosis and particularly plaque stabilization is sparse.

Hemodynamic and hormonal parameters were measured. Aliskiren and  significantly prevented atherosclerosis progression in 2-kidney, 1-clip mice. Indeed, compared with untreated animals, plaques showed thinner fibrous cap (P<0.05); smaller lipid core (P<0.05); decreased media degeneration, layering, and macrophage content (P<0.05); and increased smooth muscle cell content (P<0.05). Interestingly, aliskiren significantly increased the smooth muscle cell compared with . Despite similar blood pressure lowering, only partial plaque stabilization was attained by atenolol and amlodipine. Amlodipine increased plaque smooth muscle cell content (P<0.05), whereas atenolol decreased plaque  (P<0.05). This divergent effect was also observed in 1-kidney, 1-clip mice. Normalizing blood pressure by  increased the plasma renin concentration (5932+/-1512 ng/mL per hour) more than normalizing it by aliskiren (16085+/-5628 ng/mL per hour). Specific renin-angiotensin system blockade prevents atherosclerosis progression. First, evidence is provided that direct renin inhibition mediates atherosclerotic plaque stabilization. In contrast, beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker treatment only partially stabilize plaques differently influencing atherogenesis. Angiotensin II decisively mediates plaque vulnerability.

However, whether this condition is specific to the use of olmesartan or is associated with the use of drugs belonging to the class of "sartans" remains to be clarified. A 45-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease along with hypothyroidism and hypertension presented with chronic diarrhea and significant  loss. Endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract showed scalloping and grooving of the duodenum, and histopathological examination showed subtotal villous atrophy. She was on telmisartan for hypertension, which was discontinued. Subsequently, diarrhea ameliorated dramatically, and she regained .

Artificial neural network is a technique of data analysis, which sets out to emulate the human brain's way of working. The aim of the present work was to optimize separation of six angiotensin receptor antagonists, so-called sartans: losartan, valsartan, , telmisartan, candesartan cilexetil and eprosartan in a gradient-elution HPLC method. For this purpose, ANN as a mathematical tool was used for establishing a QSRR model based on molecular descriptors of sartans and varied instrumental conditions. The optimized model can be further used for prediction of an external congener of sartans and analysis of the influence of the analyte structure, represented through molecular descriptors, on retention behaviour. Molecular descriptors included in modelling were electrostatic, geometrical and quantum-chemical descriptors: connolly solvent excluded volume non-1,4 van der Waals , octanol/water distribution coefficient, polarizability, number of proton-donor sites and number of proton-acceptor sites. Varied instrumental conditions were gradient time, buffer pH and buffer molarity. High prediction ability of the optimized network enabled complete separation of the analytes within the run time of 15.5 min under following conditions: gradient time of 12.5 min, buffer pH of 3.95 and buffer molarity of 25 mM. Applied methodology showed the potential to predict retention behaviour of an external analyte with the properties within the training space. Connolly solvent excluded volume, polarizability and number of proton-acceptor sites appeared to be most influential paramateres on retention behaviour of the sartans.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Five groups of Wistar albino rats were used: First group consisted of healthy controls; the second group included the untreated STZ-diabetics; 30 days of  or perindopril treated STZ-diabetics formed the third and the fourth groups, respectively; while the subjects receiving a combined treatment with  and perindopril for 30 days consisted the fifth group. TUNEL method for apoptosis and immunohistochemical staining for TGF-beta1, alpha-SMA, clusterin-beta and clusterin-alpha/beta antibodies were performed. Apoptotic cells especially increased in the kidney tubuli of untreated diabetic group and on the contrary, a significant decrease was observed in the group that received a combined drug treatment. While sCLU was increased in the glomeruli and tubuli of the untreated diabetic group, it was decreased in all the treated groups. An increase in the nCLU immunoreactivity was observed in the podocytes, mesangial cells, and the injured tubule cells of the untreated diabetic group. nCLU immunopositive cells were decreased in all treated diabetic groups. In addition to this, the distribution of nCLU was similar to the distribution of apoptotic cells in the diabetic groups. Our results indicate that sCLU expression in diabetic nephropathy was induced due to renal tissue damage, and the nCLU expression increase in renal tubuli was related to apoptosis.

C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 2-week intermittent restraint stress and orally treated with vehicle, 3 and 10 mg/kg/day . The plasma concentrations of lipid and proinflammatory cytokines [Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6] were assessed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Monocyte/macrophage accumulation in inguinal white adipose tissue (WAT) was observed with CD11b-positive cell counts and mRNA expressions of CD68 and F4/80 using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR methods respectively. The mRNA levels of angiotensinogen, proinflammatory cytokines shown above, and adiponectin in WAT were also assessed with RT-PCR method. Glucose  was assessed by glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) and insulin tolerance tests, and mRNA expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in WAT. Restraint stress increased monocyte accumulation, plasma free fatty acids, expression of angiotensinogen and proinflammatory cytokines including MCP-1, and reduced adiponectin.  reduced stress-induced monocyte accumulation in WAT in a dose dependent manner.  treatment also suppressed induction of adipose angiotensinogen and proinflammatory cytokines in WAT and blood, and reversed changes in adiponectin expression.

Diabetes was induced by injection of STZ intraperitoneally after rats had received uninephroectomy.

Renal expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) were determined by immunohistochemistry.There is no significant difference of BG between group DN and group DNI (P > 0.05). Irb treatment significantly prevented the increase of Ualb excretion and 24hUpro and the deterioration of Ccr in diabetic rats (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 respectively). Furthermore, Irb markedly inhibited the increasing of KW, KW/BW, RTP, AG and VG shown in diabetic rats (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 respectively).

We explored the potential for the anti-hypertensive angiotensin II type 1-receptor (ATR(1)) antagonists to improve insulin sensitivity through modulation of the nuclear receptor PPARgamma, in vitro and in vivo compared to the potent insulin sensitizer, rosiglitazone.PPARgamma modulation by ATR(1) antagonists was measured first by direct recruitment of PGC-1, followed by trans-activation reporter assays in cells, and promotion of adipogenesis in fibroblast and pre-adipocyte cell lines. Improvement of insulin sensitivity was measured as changes in levels of glucose, insulin, and adiponectin in ob/ob mice.Telmisartan, candesartan, , and losartan (but not valsartan or olmesartan) each served as bona fide PPARgamma ligands in vitro, with EC(50) values between 3 and 5 micro mol/l. However, only telmisartan, and to a lesser extent candesartan, resulted in significant PPARgamma agonism in cells. In vivo, although rosiglitazone significantly lowered both glucose (33%, p<0.01) and insulin (61%, p<0.01) levels and increased expression of adiponectin (74%, p<0.001), sartan treatment had no effect.Many members of the sartan family of ATR(1) antagonists are PPARgamma ligands in cell-free assays but their modulation of PPARgamma in cells is relatively weak. Furthermore, none appear to improve insulin sensitivity in a rodent model under conditions where other insulin sensitizers, including rosiglitazone, do. These results question whether reported effects of sartans on insulin sensitivity may be through other means, and should guide further efforts to develop dual agents to treat hypertension and insulin resistance.</p><p>Keyword:['lipogenesis', 'obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28332327>Restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease in type 2  as the initial manifestation of Parkinson's disease and major cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22490592>Inhibition of integrin-linked kinase by angiotensin II receptor antagonist,  attenuates podocyte injury in diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) dysregulation is involved in the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN).

Twelve black salt-sensitive hypertensive patients (seven men; age, 35-58 years) on a high-sodium diet (300 mmol Na+ per day) were followed for 8 weeks. A placebo was given during the first 2 weeks, followed by 2 weeks on IRB 150 mg/d, 2 weeks on placebo, and 2 weeks on IRB 300 mg/d. On the last day of placebo, IRB 150 mg/d, and IRB 300 mg/d treatments, 24-hour BP and urinary 24-hour excretion of Na+ and potassium were measured. On placebo, ambulatory mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 112 mm Hg+/-2 (24 h), 112 mm Hg+/-2 (daytime), and 111 mm Hg+/-2 (nighttime), showing a clear circadian non-dipper profile. Versus placebo, IRB 150 mg/d reduced MAP by 4.2 mm Hg+/-1.1 (24 h), 2.6 mm Hg+/-0.8 (daytime) and 6.0 mm Hg+/-1.3 (nighttime; P<0.05 vs. placebo) and IRB 300 mg/d reduced MAP by 7.8 mm Hg+/-1.4 (24 h), 3.9 mm Hg+/-1.1 (daytime), and 11.8 mm Hg+/-2.1 mm Hg (all P<0.02 vs. placebo); nighttime/daytime MAP decrease was 0.7+/-0.8% on placebo, 3.5+/-2.1% on IRB 150 mg/d, and 7.0+/-1.2% on IRB 300 mg/d (P<0.02 for trend). Compared with placebo, IRB significantly increased serum potassium and plasma renin activity and reduced fractional excretion of potassium and plasma aldosterone levels in a dose-dependent manner.  and urinary sodium excretion did not change throughout the study. It was concluded that the angiotensin receptor blocker IRB can reverse the BP non-dipper profile in salt-sensitive hypertensive patients on a high-salt diet, restoring nocturnal BP decline by a predominantly dose-dependent reduction of nighttime BP. Although the increment of potassium balance and reduction of aldosterone may account for this effect, it occurs independently of increased natriuresis. It is speculated that blunting of nighttime BP decrease in black salt-sensitive hypertensive patients may be related to a deficient suppression of the renin-angiotensin system during the night.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16311101>Selective angiotensin II receptor antagonism enhances whole- insulin sensitivity and muscle glucose transport in hypertensive TG(mREN2)27 rats.</a></h2><p>Essential hypertension is frequently associated with insulin resistance of skeletal muscle glucose transport, and angiotensin II (ANGII) can contribute to the pathogenesis of both conditions. The male heterozygous TG(mREN2)27 rat (TGR) harbors the mouse transgene for renin, exhibits local tissue elevations in ANGII and is an excellent model of both hypertension and insulin resistance associated with defective insulin signaling. The present study was designed to assess the specific role of ANGII in the insulin resistance of the male heterozygous TGR. TGRs were treated with either vehicle or the ANGII (AT(1)-specific) receptor antagonist,  (50 mg/kg ), for 21 consecutive days. Compared with vehicle-treated TGRs, whole- insulin sensitivity was increased 35% (P < .05) in the -treated group, and insulin-mediated glucose transport was increased (P < .05) in both type IIb epitrochlearis (80%) and type I soleus (59%) muscles after  treatment. Moreover, glycogen synthase activation due to insulin was increased 58% (P < .05) in the soleus of the -treated TGRs. However, no significant improvements were observed for functionality of insulin-signaling elements (tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 [IRS1], IRS1 associated with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, and Ser473 of Akt) in muscle of -treated animals, except for a 25% increase (P < .05) in IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation in soleus.

We hypothesized that ACE2 deficiency may compromise the cardiac response to myocardial infarction (MI).In response to MI (induced by left anterior descending artery ligation), there was a persistent increase in ACE2 protein in the infarct zone in wild-type mice, whereas loss of ACE2 enhanced the susceptibility to MI, with increased mortality, infarct expansion, and adverse ventricular remodeling characterized by ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction. In ACE2-deficient hearts, elevated myocardial levels of Ang II and decreased levels of Ang 1-7 in the infarct-related zone was associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species. ACE2 deficiency leads to increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and MMP9 levels with MMP2 activation in the infarct and peri-infarct regions, as well as increased gelatinase activity leading to a disrupted extracellular matrix structure after MI. Loss of ACE2 also leads to increased neutrophilic infiltration in the infarct and peri-infarct regions, resulting in upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, interferon-gamma, interleukin-6, and the chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, as well as increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 signaling pathways. Treatment of Ace2(-)(/y)-MI mice with , an AT1 receptor blocker, reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity, infarct size, MMP activation, and myocardial , ultimately resulting in improved post-MI ventricular function.We conclude that loss of ACE2 facilitates adverse post-MI ventricular remodeling by potentiation of Ang II effects by means of the AT1 receptors, and supplementing ACE2 can be a potential therapy for ischemic heart disease.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12020687>Two angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists,  and losartan, effects in cholesterol-fed rabbits.</a></h2><p>This study was performed to examine the long-term effects of  and losartan, two angiotensin (AT(1)) receptor antagonists, on lipoproteins and vascular responsiveness in vessels isolated from hypercholesterolemic rabbits.

Hypertensive patients with concomitant diabetes must take both antihypertensive and hypoglycaemic medications, for which there is a lack of experimental and clinical guidelines. This study aimed to examine the interaction between these two types of medication on the endothelial cell function.The effect of antihypertensive (nifedipine and ) and anti-diabetic (metformin and glibenclamide/glimepiride) drugs on human umbilical vein cells (HUVECs) function was examined using a modified Boyden chamber assay. The intracellular NO and O2- levels of HUVECs were detected through flow cytometry.Our findings showed that nifedipine/sulphonylurea monotherapy significantly attenuated high glucose-induced (33 mM) HUVECs migration incapacity, while combination therapy of nifedipine and glibenclamide/glimepiride showed no protective effect. Both nifedipine/metformin monotherapy and combined therapy significantly mitigated the migration incapacity induced by high glucose in HUVECs. Combined with either metformin or sulphonylureas,  therapy was able to attenuate the high glucose-induced migration incapacity of HUVECs. Nifedipine monotherapy decreased the O2- levels and increased the NO levels in in vitro-cultured HUVECs treated with high glucose. However, the combination therapy of nifedipine and glibenclamide increased the O2- levels and decreased the NO levels compared to the nifedipine monotherapeutic group.The nifedipine and glibenclamide/glimepiride combination exerted a mutual antagonistic effect on the protection from high glucose-induced impairment in endothelial cells, which might be partially attributed to the increased O2- level and decreased NO level.

Acute  can lead to damaged endothelium triggering the coagulation cascade and thrombus formation. Likewise, the clotting cascade may elicit an inflammatory response. The vascular endothelium regulates vascular tone, permeability, , thrombosis, and coagulation. Dysfunction of the vascular endothelium can promote atherosclerotic disease processes. Prostanoids (prostaglandins, thromboxane, and prostacyclin) have been established as inflammatory mediators in vascular endothelial function and there continues to be growing insights into their role in atherosclerotic disease. This review examines the role of prostanoids as paracrine inflammatory mediators of atherosclerotic vascular disease, highlighting the relevant physiology of eicosanoid production and endothelial dysfunction. We consider the role of prostanoids in systemic diseases associated with high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, including diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, rheumatologic disorders, and dyslipidemia. We present emerging evidence that cardio-protective and lipid lowering medications, such as  and simvastatin may exert their effects via prostanoid mediated pathways. Both serum and urinary prostanoids may be utilized as diagnostic predictors of disease; for example 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) in the serum has recently been reported as an independent predictor of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. In addition, we discuss current recommendations on established therapeutic uses of prostanoids for atherosclerotic diseases, such as the use of PGE(1) for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease.

When calculating the eGFR decline from month 3, attenuation of the HR was less pronounced.Post hoc analysis.Despite increases in precision of the treatment effect, eGFR declines less than a doubling of serum creatinine value did not consistently improve statistical power of the clinical trials due to attenuation of the treatment effect. Attenuation of the treatment effect appears to be due in part to acute effects of ARBs on eGFR.

Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-containing fibers innervate autonomic motor and premotor nuclei of the brainstem and spinal cord that regulate cardiovascular functions. We compared cardiovascular responses to application of TRH-analog in the brainstem of Wistar and T2D Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats. GK rats exhibited basal systolic hypertension (152±2 mm Hg) and had a significantly potentiated, dose-related hypertensive response to intracisternal (i.c.) injection of the TRH-analog RX77368 (10-60 ng). In GK rats only, i.c. RX77368 (30-60 ng) markedly increased heart rate (HR; +88 b.p.m.) and induced acute cardiac mortality (100%), concurrent with extreme hyperglycemia (>26 mmol l(-1)), increased plasma H(2)O(2) and 8-isoprostane, and enhanced heart expression of NADPH oxidase 4 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 mRNAs. GK rats also had elevated basal plasma epinephrine, higher adrenal gene expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine β-hydroxylase (DβH), and greater plasma catecholamine and adrenal DβH responses to i.c. TRH-analog, compared with Wistar rats. In GK rats, hexamethonium blocked i.c. RX77368-induced hypertensive and tachycardic responses, and reduced mortality by 86%, whereas phentolamine abolished the hypertensive response but enhanced tachycardia (+160 b.p.m.), and reduced mortality by 50%. The angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist  prevented i.c. RX77368-induced increases in blood pressure, HR and mortality.

In humans, cross-sectional studies found an inverse relation between bilirubin and DN. We prospectively investigated whether bilirubin is associated with progression of DN toward end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To this end, we performed a post hoc analysis in the Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) trial with independent replication in the  Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT). Subjects with type 2  and nephropathy with alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin levels <1.5 times the upper limit of normal were included. The renal end point was defined as the composite of confirmed doubling of serum creatinine or ESRD. Bilirubin was inversely associated with the renal end point in RENAAL independent of age, sex, race, BMI, smoking, total cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure, HbA1c, treatment, estimated glomerular filtration rate, albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and AST. These results were confirmed in IDNT. This study indicates an independent inverse association of bilirubin with progression of nephropathy in RENAAL and IDNT.

However, the association has been questioned: a phase 3 trial and a cohort study found no association between gastrointestinal events and olmesartan.To collect French cases of sartan-associated enteropathy to describe further this entity, confirm or refute causality, and determine if the association exists with other sartans.French gastroenterologists were invited to report cases of sartan-associated enteropathy and collect clinical, biological and histological data. Patients with diarrhoea and histological duodenal abnormalities were included.Thirty-six patients with olmesartan-associated enteropathy were reported, including 32 with villous atrophy and four without. There was only one patient with -associated enteropathy. None of the patients died. Patients with villous atrophy had diarrhoea, vomiting, renal failure, hypokalaemia, body weight loss and hypoalbuminaemia. Thirty-one patients were hospitalised; four required intensive care. Anti-transglutaminase and anti-enterocyte antibodies were negative; anti-nuclear antibodies were positive (9/11). Endoscopic duodenal biopsies showed villous atrophy (32/32) and polyclonal intra-epithelial CD3+CD8+ lymphocytosis (11/11). Exactly, 14/15 patients responded to steroids and/or immunosuppressants, prescribed because of suspected autoimmune enteropathy. Ten olmesartan interruptions were followed by reintroductions before steroids or immunosuppressants. Interruptions were followed by remissions (9/10), but reintroductions were followed by relapses (9/9). Twenty-nine patients were in remission since olmesartan interruption, including 26 without immunosuppressants. Patients with normal villi had similar clinical characteristics, but mild histological abnormalities (intra-epithelial lymphocytosis and lamina propria lymphocytic infiltration).Olmesartan causes a severe and immune-mediated enteropathy, with or without villous atrophy. Enteropathy associated with other sartans seems to be very rare.© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22303879>Circulating microparticles and endothelial progenitor cells in atherosclerosis: pharmacological effects of .</a></h2><p>This study aimed to (i) employ our newly designed model, the hypertensive-hypercholesterolemic hamster (HH), in order to find out whether a correlation exists between circulating microparticles (MPs), endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and their contribution to vascular dysfunction and (ii) to assess the effect of  treatment on HH animals (HHI).The results showed that compared with the control (C) group, HH displayed: (i) a significant increase in plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentration, and an augmentation of systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure, and of heart rate; (ii) a marked elevation of MPs and a significant decrease in EPCs; (iii) structural modifications of the arterial wall correlated with altered protein expression of MMP2, MMP9, MMP12, TIMP1, TIMP2 and collagen type I and III; (iv) a considerably altered reactivity of the arterial wall closely correlated with MPs and EPC adherence; and (v) an inflammatory process characterized by augmented expression of P-Selectin, E-Selectin, von Willebrand factor, tissue factor, IL-6, MCP-1 and RANTES.

This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of adding atorvastatin to  in early diabetic nephropathy. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang database until March 25, 2019. Randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of adding atorvastatin to  in early diabetic nephropathy were eligible. Primary endpoint was urinary albumin excretion rate, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen. Serum level of total cholesterol, triglyceride, fasting blood glucose, interleukin-6,and C-reactive protein (CRP) as well as blood pressure were secondary endpoints. Seventeen trials involving 1,390 patients were identified. Compared with  alone, co-administration of atorvastatin and  significantly reduced urinary albumin excretion rate (weighted mean differences [WMD] -21.22 μg/min; 95% confidence interval [CI] -26.95 to -15.50), serum creatinine (WMD -6.46 μmol/L; 95%CI -8.52 to 4.39),BUN (WMD -0.46 mmol/L; 95%CI -0.64 to -0.27), total cholesterol (WMD -1.79 mmol/L; 95%CI -2.34 to -1.23), triglyceride (WMD -0.93 mmol/L; 95%CI -1.20 to -0.67),and systolic blood pressure (WMD -2.27 mmHg; 95%CI -4.01 to -0.53), CRP (standard mean difference [SMD] 1.57; 95%CI -2.24 to -0.9), and Interleukin-6 (SMD 1.53; 95%CI -2.29 to -0.78). However, there was a significantly increased risk of nausea/vomiting (risk ratio 3.15; 95% CI 1.18-8.38) on the co-administration group. In conclusion, adding atorvastatin to  achieves additional renal protective benefits in early diabetic nephropathy patients.

Reference citations from relevant publications, manufacturers' product information, and www.HIV-druginteractions.org were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTIONS: All articles with an English abstract identified through the data search were examined. Of these, pharmacologic reviews, studies, and case reports were evaluated.Antihypertensive drugs interact with several antiretroviral drugs, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) in particular. Pharmacokinetic interactions are less expected with diuretics, β-blockers excreted by the kidney, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) other than losartan and . Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are metabolized by CYP3A4, with the potential for interaction with NNRTIs and PIs. Because CCBs do not adversely affect glucose or  or renal function, they may be preferred in patients with such complications. ACE inhibitors and ARBs may exert favorable effects on glucose homeostasis. In addition, they may significantly reduce protein excretion and further slow the progression of renal disease.The choice of antihypertensive drugs in HIV-infected patients is complex and must take into account the metabolic pathways of antiretroviral drugs and antihypertensive drugs with the potential of pharmacokinetic interactions, as well as the effect of antihypertensive drugs on some biological parameters.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16635409>Effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II type I receptor blocker and their combination on postinfarcted ventricular remodeling in rats.</a></h2><p>Transforming growth factor (TGF) beta(1)-Smads signal plays an important role in cardiac remodeling following myocardial infarction (MI). In addition, both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II type I receptor blocker (ARB) can effectively prevent left ventricular remodeling. The current study focused on whether the combination of ACEI and ARB is more beneficial for preventing ventricular remodeling and whether Smad proteins mediate this beneficial effect.MI was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery in rats. Twenty-four hours after ligation, the survived rats were randomly divided into five groups and treated for 8 weeks: placebo group, ACEI group (benazepril 10 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)), ARB group ( 50 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)), ACEI + ARB group (benazepril 10 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) +  50 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)) and control group (sham-operated rats). After 8 weeks, we examined the following indexes: the ratio of ventricular  to  (VW/BW), left ventricular end diastolic dimension (LVDd), ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS), ratio of E-wave to A-wave velocity, collagen of noninfarcted zone, the mRNA expression of TGFbeta(1), Smad 2, and Smad 3 by RT-PCR in noninfarcted zone, the protein expression of Smad 2 and Smad 3 in noninfarcted zone by Western blot.VW/BW significantly increased in the placebo groups compared with that in the control group (P < 0.01). This increase was limited in ACEI, ARB, and combined groups (P < 0.01 compared with placebo group). There was no significant difference among the three actively treated groups. Collagen was increased in placebo group (5.68 +/- 0.5)% compared with that in control group (P < 0.01). ACEI, ARB and combined treatment attenuated this increase of collagen [(4.3 +/- 0.5)%, (3.5 +/- 0.5)%, (3.2 +/- 0.4)%] in comparison with that in placebo group (P < 0.01 respectively). Combined treatment showed more significant effect on collagen deposition. EF and FS significantly decreased, LVDd and E/A significantly increased in placebo group compared with that in control group (P < 0.01 respectively). ACEI, ARB and combined treatment ameliorated these indexes (P < 0.01 compared with placebo group). The mRNA expression of TGFbeta(1), Smad 2, and Smad 3 (0.700 +/- 0.045, 0.959 +/- 0.037 and 0.850 +/- 0.051) increased in placebo group compared with that in control group (P < 0.01). ACEI, ARB and combined treatment normalized the increase (P < 0.01). Furthermore, ARB and combined treatment proved to be more effective in decreasing TGF beta(1) and Smad mRNA expression than ACEI treatment (P < 0.01). The expression of Smad 2 and Smad 3 protein increased in placebo group compared with that in control group (P < 0.01). ACEI, ARB and combined treatment normalized the increase (P < 0.01). Furthermore, ARB and combined treatment proved to be more effective than ACEI alone (P < 0.01).TGFbeta(1)-Smads signal activation is correlated with ventricular remodeling following MI. ACEI and ARB treatment prevents ventricular remodeling by inhibiting expression of Smad 2 and Smad 3.

The effects of Ang II receptor blockade (ARB) ( 15 mg/kg body weight/day) on proteinuria and on the expression of the SD molecules were analyzed.mRNA expressions of nephrin, podocin and NEPH1 were decreased to an undetectable level at 1 h. The staining of these SD molecules shifted to a discontinuous pattern, and their intensity was reduced. NEPH1 staining was reduced to an undetectable level on day 10. ARB treatment ameliorated the peak value of proteinuria (237.6 ± 97.0 vs. 359.0 ± 63.3 mg/day, p < 0.05), and prevented the decrease in the mRNA expression of the SD molecules (nephrin 66.96 %, podocin 60.40 %, NEPH1 77.87 % of normal level). The immunofluorescence staining of NEPH1 was restored by ARB. ARB treatment enhanced the expression of NEPH1 of normal rats.Dysfunction of the SD molecules including NEPH1 is a crucial initiation event of PAN nephropathy.

The diabetic model rats were then randomly divided into DM group, low-dose (8 mg/kg) and high-dose (16 mg/kg) TG treatment groups, and  (50 mg/kg) treatment group. After 8 weeks, the levels of blood glucose (BG), 24-h urine protein (24 h Upro), serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured. The pathological changes in the renal tissues were examined by optical microscopy, and the mean glomerular area (MGA) and mean glomerular volume (MGV) were measured with pathological image analysis. Immunohistochemical and Western blotting were used to detect the expression of HIF-1α and ET-1 protein in the renal tissue, and their mRNA expressions were detected using real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR.HIF-1α and ET-1 expression increased in the kidney of diabetic rats. Compared with the diabetic model rats, the rats receiving TG and  treatment showed decreased levels of Scr, BUN, 24h Upro, MGA and MGV, improved renal histopathology, and reduced expression of HIF-1α and ET-1 mRNA and protein in the renal tissue.

However, it can only be measured indirectly (following its conversion to renin), with a renin immunoradiometric assay (IRMA). Unfortunately, treatment with a renin inhibitor interferes with this assay, because renin inhibitors induce a conformational change in prorenin, thereby allowing its detection as renin.We evaluated Molecular Innovation's new direct prorenin ELISA, which makes use of an antibody that recognizes an epitope near prorenin's putative cleavage site (R 43 L 44), thus no longer requiring prorenin activation. Plasma samples of 41 diabetic individuals treated with aliskiren (renin inhibitor) or  were tested. Semi-purified recombinant prorenin was used as standard, because the ELISA standard yielded approximately 10-fold lower values in the renin IRMA following its conversion to renin.The ELISA detected prorenin levels that were identical to those determined by the IRMA in untreated and -treated individuals. Yet, it yielded higher prorenin levels in aliskiren-treated individuals. Aliskiren, at levels reached in plasma during treatment, did not interfere with the ELISA, but allowed the detection of up to 20-30% of prorenin as renin in the IRMA, thereby resulting in a significant overestimation of renin and an underestimation of prorenin. The ELISA rendered results within 2 h and did not require a pretreatment period of several days to convert prorenin to renin.The new direct assay allows rapid prorenin detection, is not hampered by aliskiren when used at clinically relevant doses, and might be used to identify diabetic patients developing retinopathy and/or nephropathy.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25872610>The renal protective effect of angiotensin receptor blockers depends on intra-individual response variation in multiple risk markers.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are renoprotective and targeted to blood pressure. However, ARBs have multiple other (off-target) effects which may affect renal outcome. It is unknown whether on-target and off-target effects are congruent within individuals. If not, this variation in short term effects may have important implications for the prediction of individual long term renal outcomes. Our aim was to assess intra-individual variability in multiple parameters in response to ARBs in type 2 diabetes.Changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), albuminuria, potassium, haemoglobin, cholesterol and uric acid after 6 months of losartan treatment were assessed in the RENAAL database. Improvement in predictive performance of renal outcomes (ESRD or doubling serum creatinine) for each individual using ARB-induced changes in all risk markers was assessed by the relative integrative discrimination index (RIDI).SBP response showed high variability (mean -5.7 mmHg, 5(th) to 95(th) percentile -36.5 to +24.0 mmHg) between individuals. Changes in off-target parameters also showed high variability between individuals. No congruency was observed between responses to losartan in multiple parameters within individuals. Using individual responses in all risk markers significantly improved renal risk prediction (RIDI 30.4%, P < 0.01) compared with using only SBP changes. Results were successfully replicated in two independent trials with , IDNT and IRMA-2.In this post hoc analysis we showed that ARBs have multiple off-target effects which vary between and within individuals. Combining all ARB-induced responses beyond SBP provides a more accurate prediction of who will benefit from ARB therapy. Prospective trials are required to validate these findings.© 2015 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30531843>Effects of hypertension and antihypertensive treatments on sulfatide levels in serum and its .</a></h2><p>Serum sulfatides are critical glycosphingolipids present in lipoproteins that work as modulators of thrombosis and hemostasis. Decreased serum sulfatide levels are suggested by our previous work to be related to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hypertension, known to be an important risk factor for CVD, may affect serum sulfatide levels. However, how hypertension affects serum sulfatides directly and mechanistically is unknown. To elucidate these possible mechanisms, we investigated changes in serum sulfatide levels and their  using an established experimental model of hypertension that uses continuous infusion of angiotensin II (AngII) into mice. Furthermore, we also examined the effects of four different antihypertensive drugs (losartan, , nifedipine, and hydralazine) on serum sulfatide . Serum levels of sulfatides were found to be decreased in groups in which only hypertension was induced (AngII only), whereas they were increased in groups with reduced blood pressure (antihypertensives only) and ameliorated to increasingly normal levels in groups with induced hypertension that were also treated (AngII+antihypertensives). Changes in serum sulfatides were strongly related to hepatic expression levels of cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST), which is a key enzyme involved in sulfatide synthesis. Furthermore, the current study suggests that the primary factors affecting CST expression are oxidative stress, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α activity and blood pressure itself. This study demonstrates that hypertension significantly decreases levels of serum sulfatides by reducing hepatic CST expression via various effects mediated by AngII. Antihypertensive treatments can ameliorate abnormalities in serum sulfatide levels and may partially prevent hypertension related CVD by positively affecting sulfatide .</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22426690>Angiotensin II receptor type 1 blockers suppress the cell proliferation             effects of angiotensin II in breast cancer cells by inhibiting AT1R signaling.</a></h2><p>Chronic stress and a high- diet are well-documented risk factors associated with the renin-angiotensin system in the development of breast cancer. The angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) is a novel component of the renin-angiotensin system. Several recent studies have focused on the function of AT1R in cell proliferation during cancer development. Thus, we hypothesized that angiotensin II (Ang Ⅱ) can promote proliferation of breast cancer via activated AT1R; the activation of AT1R may play an important role in promoting breast cancer growth, and AT1R blocker (ARB) may suppress the promotional effect on proliferation by antagonizing AT1R. The expression level of AT1R was found to be significantly upregulated in breast cancer cells by immunohistochemistry, but no correlation between AT1R expression and ER/PR/Her-2 expression was observed. The AT1R(+)-MCF-7 cell line exhibited high expression of AT1R protein, and we generated the AT1R(-)-MCF-7 cell line using RNA interference. ARBs, and in particular , effectively inhibited the effects of Ang II on cell proliferation, cell cycle development and downstream AT1R signaling events, including the activation of the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway and the transcription factors NF-κB and CREB.  also significantly altered p53, PCNA and cyclin D1 expression, which was also influenced by activated AT1R in AT1R(+)-MCF-7 cells.

AngII has also been shown to increase antioxidant enzyme extracellular superoxide dismutase (ecSOD). However, the roles of TLR4 in Ang II-induced ROS production, vascular remodeling and hypertension remain unknown. Mice lacking TLR4 function showed significant inhibition of vascular remodeling in response to chronic AngII infusion, with no impact on blood pressure. The increases in ROS level and NADPH oxidase activity in response to AngII infusion were markedly blunted in TLR4-deficient mice. Similar effects were observed in wild-type (WT) mice treated with a sub-depressor dose of the AT1 receptor antagonist , which had no effects on TLR4-deficient mice. Intriguingly, the AngII infusion-induced increases in ecSOD activity and expression were rather enhanced in TLR4-deficient mice compared with WT mice, whereas the expression of the proinflammatory chemokine MCP-1 was decreased. Importantly, AngII-induced vascular remodeling was positively correlated with NADPH oxidase activity, ROS levels and MCP-1 expression levels. Notably, chronic norepinephrine infusion, which elevates blood pressure without increasing ROS production, did not induce significant vascular remodeling in WT mice.

Although the local RAS is reported to play an essential role in maintaining local tissue functions, the role of the local RAS in regulating glomerular function is not well evaluated. In this study, we analyzed the glomerular expression of RAS components in nephrotic models and the effect of Ang II receptor blockers (ARB) on the expression of angiotensinogen (AGT).The levels of glomerular expression of RAS components were analyzed in two nephrotic models: anti-nephrin antibody-induced nephropathy and PAN nephropathy, a mimic of human minimal change nephrotic syndrome. The effect of the ARB  on the expression of AGT in the nephrotic model was analyzed.Glomerular expression of AGT and the receptors for Ang II was clearly increased in the nephrotic models, while the expression levels of renin, ACE and ACE2 were decreased. ARB treatment suppressed the increase of glomerular expression of AGT in the nephrotic model.It is conceivable that the promoted local RAS action participated in the glomerular dysfunction, and that ARB treatment ameliorated slit diaphragm injury by inhibiting the positive feedback loop of the activated local Ang II action.© The Author(s) 2016.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29291887>Predictors of Mortality in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (from the Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial With  for Prevention of Vascular Events [ACTIVE A]).</a></h2><p>The mortality rate of most patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) exceeds the stroke rate, but predictors of mortality have not been well defined. The Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial With  for Prevention of Vascular Events (ACTIVE A) recruited patients with AF who were unsuitable to receive vitamin K-antagonists and were randomized to aspirin alone versus aspirin plus clopidogrel. We investigated independent predictors of all-cause mortality by multivariable Cox regression analysis and explored interactions with assigned antiplatelet therapy. Of the 7,554 patients enrolled with a mean age of 71 years, 1,687 (22%) patients died during the median follow-up of 3.7 years (annualized mortality rate 6.4%/year). Assignment to dual antiplatelet therapy had no effect on mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90 to 1.1) or on vascular and nonvascular death. Independent predictors of all-cause mortality were advancing age, lower body mass index (HR 1.4 < 25 kg/m, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.6), , Latin American ethnicity (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.6), previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, peripheral artery disease, increased resting heart rate (HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.4 per 30 bpm), lower diastolic blood pressure, coronary artery disease, heart failure, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, hemoglobin level of <13 mg/dl, and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate. In conclusion, in this large clinical trial cohort of patients with AF, treatment with clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin monotherapy did not affect all-cause mortality, vascular death, or nonvascular death. Novel independent predictors of increased mortality included lower diastolic blood pressure and Latin American ethnicity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Since aging-related decline in skeletal muscle function was retarded in Atgr1a(-/-) mice, we examined the role of AT1 receptor in muscle regeneration after injury. Administration of AT1 receptor blocker  increased the size of regenerating myofibers, decreased fibrosis, and enhanced functional muscle recovery after cryoinjury.

While angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the cleavage of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, the active peptide that causes a pressor response, the ARBs inhibit its peripheral action. The ARBs reduce blood pressure in animal models as well as in humans. Since their introduction in 1995, these agents have been used widely in the therapy of hypertension and to reduce the complications of hypertensive cardiovascular disease and diabetic nephropathy. The ARBs in clinical use in the United States include eight agents of similar chemical structure and activity, but somewhat different pharmacokinetics: losartan (Cozaar: 1995), valsartan (Diovan: 1996),  (Avapro: 1997), eprosartan (Teveten: 1997), candesartan (Atacand: 1998), telmisartan (Micardis: 1998), olmesartan (Benicar: 2002) and azilsartan (Edarbi: 2011). All of these agents have been associated with a minimal rate of serum enzyme elevations during chronic therapy (0.2% to 2%) which are usually mild-to-moderate in severity, self limited, and rarely require dose modification or discontinuation. As a class, the ARBs have been associated with rare instances of acute liver injury that is usually self limited in duration, but varies in clinical expression, being usually hepatocellular but occasional cholestatic in nature. The most common presentation of liver injury due to these agents is a cholestatic hepatitis arising within 1 to 8 weeks of starting and resolving as rapidly with stopping. Rare instances of prolonged jaundice have been described but not acute liver failure or autoimmune chronic hepatitis. Several Individual case reports of clinically apparent liver injury have been published in the literature for losartan, valsartan,  olmesartan and candesartan, but not specifically for azilsartan, eprosartan, and telmisartan, probably because these three have been in use for a shorter period of time and in fewer subjects. Most ARBs and particularly olmesartan have been linked to rare instances of severe sprue-like enteropathy. The enteropathy typically presents with severe diarrhea and  loss with variable degrees of fatigue, nausea and abdominal discomfort arising 6 months to many years after starting the ARB. Small intestinal histological findings resemble those of celiac disease with flattening of the duodenal villuous pattern and villous atrophy. However, anti-transglutaminase and endomysial antibodies (the serologic markers of celiac disease) are negative and there is little or no response to a gluten-free diet. Withdrawal of the ARB, however, results in prompt improvement in the diarrhea and gradual resolution of duodenal villous flattening. Some cases of this drug induced enteropathy have had accompanying serum aminotransferase elevations and fatty liver by imaging or liver biopsy, which, along with the diarrhea, resolve rapidly with stopping the medication.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'fatty liver', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25987260>Serum Bicarbonate and Kidney Disease Progression and Cardiovascular Outcome in Patients With Diabetic Nephropathy: A Post Hoc Analysis of the RENAAL (Reduction of End Points in Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes With the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan) Study and IDNT ( Diabetic Nephropathy Trial).</a></h2><p>Low serum bicarbonate level has been reported to be an independent predictor of kidney function decline and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease.

There are very few studies examining the cellular synthesis of 20-HETE in humans. We aimed to measure human neutrophil and platelet 20-HETE levels under basal conditions and after ANG II, ET-1, and calcium ionophore (CaI). 20-HETE was measured in human platelets and neutrophils after saline (control), CaI (2.5 μg/ml), and ANG II or ET-1 (10 nmol/l-1 μmol/l) incubations. The effect of cells, which were preincubated with the ω-hydroxylase inhibitor N-hydroxy-N'-(4-butyl-2-methylphenyl) (HET0016, 10 nM), ANG II types 1 or 2 (AT(1) or AT(2)) receptor inhibition with  (1 μmol/l) or PD-123319 (1 μmol/l), or endothelin receptor subtypes A or B (ET(A) or ET(B)) receptor inhibition with BQ-123 or BQ-778 (100 nmol/l), was studied. Neutrophil and platelet content and release of 20-HETE was significantly increased by CaI and blocked by the ω-hydroxylase inhibitor HET0016. ANG II and ET-1 significantly increased neutrophil and platelet content and release of 20-HETE. ANG II increased 20-HETE via the AT(2) receptor. ET-1 increased 20-HETE through the ET(B) receptor in platelets and both the ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in neutrophils. These studies show that human platelets and neutrophils synthesize 20-HETE in response to ANG II and ET-1. 20-HETE synthesis in both cell types was predominantly mediated via the AT(2) and ET(B) receptors. Stimulation via these receptor pathways has generally been thought to be cardioprotective and requires further studies in clinical situations associated with low-grade  or where ANG II and ET-1 are elevated to clarify the role of 20-HETE.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17069818>Angiotensin II type 1-receptor antagonism prevents type IIA secretory phospholipase A2-dependent lipid peroxidation.</a></h2><p>Accumulation and modification of low density lipoproteins (LDL) within the vessel wall represent key events in atherogenesis. Secretory phospholipase A2 type IIA (sPLA2-IIA) modulates the enzymatic process of LDL-modification and was recently identified as an independent predictor of coronary events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Angiotensin II (ANG II) type 1 (AT1)-receptor blockade reduces LDL-modification and atherosclerotic plaque formation in rodent and primate models of atherosclerosis. Therefore, we assessed whether ANG II via its AT1-receptor enhances sPLA2-IIA-dependent lipid peroxidation in vitro and in patients with CAD. Stimulation of rat aortic smooth muscle cells with ANG II (10(-7) mol/L) enhanced sPLA2-IIA protein expression, activity as well as LDL-peroxidation, determined by western blot, activity assay and malondialdehyde (MDA)-assay and diene formation, respectively, and were blunted by AT1-receptor blockade (Losartan, 10(-5) mol/L). In addition, ANG II-induced sPLA2 activity and LDL-peroxidation were abolished by the sPLA2-IIa activity inhibitor LY311727 (10(-5) mol/L). To evaluate a potential clinical implication, patients (n=18) with angiographically documented CAD were treated with the AT1-receptor blocker  (IRB; 300 mg/d) for 12 weeks. Blood samples were obtained from patients pre- and post-treatment and from healthy volunteers. SPLA2-IIA serum level and activity, circulating antibodies against oxidized LDL (oxLDL), oxLDL and MDA were determined in patients and found to be significantly increased compared to healthy volunteers. IRB therapy reduced these markers of , whereas total cholesterol, HDL- and LDL-fractions remained unchanged. ANG II may elicit pro-atherosclerotic effects via type IIA sPLA2-dependent LDL-modifications. Chronical AT1-receptor blockade reduces sPLA2-IIA level and activity and subsequently lipid peroxidation. Theses findings represent a novel anti-atherosclerotic mechanism and imply that AT1-receptor blockade elicits anti-atherosclerotic potencies even in the absence of plasma cholesterol reduction.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20484304>Effects of angiotensin type 1 receptor blockade on arginine and ADMA synthesis and metabolic pathways in fawn-hooded hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>The fawn-hooded hypertensive (FHH) rat develops spontaneous glomerulosclerosis that is ameliorated by inhibition of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT-1). Since kidney damage is associated with nitric oxide (NO) deficiency, we investigated how AT-1 antagonism influenced nitric oxide synthase (NOS), as well as NOS substrate [L-arginine (L-Arg)] and inhibitor [asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)]. L-Arg is synthesized by renal argininosuccinate synthase/argininosuccinate lyase (ASS/ASL) and then either consumed within the kidney by arginase II or NOS or released into the circulation. L-Arg is then taken up from plasma into cells where it can be utilized by NOS and other pathways. The competitive inhibitor of NOS, ADMA, is degraded by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH).Male FHH rats were put on a 40% casein diet for 13 weeks, and some received AT-1 antagonist which reduced blood pressure and kidney  and prevented glomerulosclerosis and hyperfiltration. The AT-1 antagonist reduced the expression of DDAH2, increased DDAH1 and increased total DDAH activity in the kidney cortex, although there was no change in plasma or kidney cortex ADMA levels. The AT-1 antagonist caused no change in the expression of renal ASS/ASL, but reduced renal and aortic arginase expression and renal arginase activity, which could explain the increased plasma L-Arg. In separate studies, 1 week of AT-1 blockade in young FHH rats had no effect on any of these parameters.Thus, the net result of AT-1 antagonist was an improved L-Arg to ADMA ratio due to the prevention of renal and vascular arginase activation which favours increased NO production. Since 1 week of AT-1 blockade in the absence of kidney damage was without effect on arginases, this suggests that the reduction in arginase activity is secondary to the prevention of structural damage rather than a direct immediate effect of AT-1 antagonism.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30002098>Effects of Sacubitril/Valsartan Versus  in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.</a></h2><p>Sacubitril/valsartan reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but its effects on kidney function and cardiac biomarkers in people with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease are unknown.The UK HARP-III trial (United Kingdom Heart and Renal Protection-III), a randomized double-blind trial, included 414 participants with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 20 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m who were randomly assigned to sacubitril/valsartan 97/103 mg twice daily versus  300 mg once daily.

The rats were randomly allotted into one of five experimental groups: A (control), B (diabetic untreated), C (diabetic treated with Q), D (diabetic treated with Irb), and E (diabetic treated with Q&Irb), each group containing 10 animals. Groups B-E received STZ. Diabetes was induced in four groups by a single intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of STZ (50 mg/kg, freshly dissolved in 5 mmol/L citrate buffer, pH 4.5). Two days after STZ treatment, development of diabetes in four experimental groups was confirmed by measuring blood glucose levels in a tail vein blood samples. Rats with blood glucose levels of 250 mg/dL or higher were considered to be diabetic. The rats in Q-, Irb-, and Q&Irb-treated groups were given Q (in a dose of 3 mg/kg ), Irb (5 mg/kg ), and Q&Irb (in a dose of 1.5 mg/kg + 2.5 mg/kg ) once a day orally by using intra-gastric intubation for 12 weeks starting two days after STZ injection. Treatment of Q and especially Irb reduced the glomerular size and thickening of capsular, glomerular, and tubular basement membranes; and increased amounts of mesangial matrix and tubular dilatation and renal function as compared with diabetics untreated. Notably, the better effects were obtained when Q and Irb given together. We conclude that Q, Irb, and especially Q+Irb therapy causes renal morphologic and functional improvement after STZ-induced diabetes in rats. We believe that further preclinical research into the utility of Q and Irb treatment, alone or its combination, may indicate its usefulness as a potential treatment in diabetic nephropathy (DNp).</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29279269>Renin angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers usage among type II diabetes mellitus patients-A Retrospective Study.</a></h2><p>Recent data showed an alarming rise of new dialysis cases secondary to diabetic nephropathy despite the growing usage of RAAS blockers. Primary objective of this study is to explore the prevalence of RAAS blockers usage among type II diabetic patients, secondary objectives are to compare the prescribing pattern of RAAS blocker between primary and tertiary care center and to explore if the dose of RAAS blocker prescribed was at optimal dose as suggested by trials.This is a retrospective study conducted at one public tertiary referral hospital and one public health clinic in Sungai Petani, Kedah, Malaysia.RAAS blockers in T2DM patients was found to be 65%. In primary care, 14.3% of the RAAS blockers prescribed was ARB. Tertiary care had higher utilization of ARB, which was 42.9%. In primary care setting, the most commonly used ACEI were perindopril (92.4%) followed by enalapril (7.6%), meanwhile perindopril was the only ACEI being prescribed in tertiary care. The most prescribed ARB was  (63.6%) and telmisartan (54.2%) respectively in primary and tertiary care. Overall, 64.9% of RAAS blockers prescribed by both levels of care were found to be achieving the target dose as recommended in landmark trials. Crude odd ratio of prescribing RAAS blocker in primary care versus tertiary care was reported as 2.70 (95% CI: 1.49 to 4.91).RAAS blockers usage among T2DM patients was higher in primary care versus tertiary care settings.

An oral hypoglycemic agent, metformin may have a potential effect on the inhibition of glycation reactions. Further, since a pathophysiological crosstalk between renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and AGEs-RAGE axis is involved in diabetic nephropathy, it is conceivable that metformin and  additively could protect against the AGEs-RAGE-induced tubular cell injury. In this study, we addressed the issues. Metformin dose-dependently inhibited the formation of AGEs modification of bovine serum albumin (BSA). Compared with AGEs-modified BSA prepared without metformin (AGEs-MF0), those prepared in the presence of 30 mM or 100 mM metformin (AGEs-MF30 or AGEs-MF100) significantly reduced RAGE mRNA level, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, apoptosis, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and transforming growth factor-β mRNA level in tubular cells.  further inhibited the harmful effects of AGEs-MF0 or AGEs-MF30 on tubular cells. Our present study suggests that combination therapy with metformin and  may have therapeutic potential in diabetic nephropathy; it could play a protective role against tubular injury in  not only by inhibiting AGEs formation, but also by attenuating the deleterious effects of AGEs via down-regulating RAGE expression and subsequently suppressing ROS generation.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has recently been identified as a specific Ang II-degrading enzyme but its role in vascular biology remains elusive. We hypothesized that loss of ACE2 would facilitate Ang II-mediated vascular  and peroxynitrite production. 10-week wildtype (WT, Ace2(+/y)) and ACE2 knockout (ACE2KO, Ace2(-/y)) mice received with mini-osmotic pumps with Ang II (1.5 mg.kg⁻¹.d⁻¹) or saline for 2 weeks. Aortic ACE2 protein was obviously reduced in WT mice in response to Ang II related to increases in profilin-1 protein and plasma levels of Ang II and Ang-(1-7). Loss of ACE2 resulted in greater increases in Ang II-induced mRNA expressions of inflammatory cytokines monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 without affecting tumor necrosis factor-α in aortas of ACE2KO mice. Furthermore, ACE2 deficiency led to greater increases in Ang II-mediated profilin-1 expression, NADPH oxidase activity, and superoxide and peroxynitrite production in the aortas of ACE2KO mice associated with enhanced phosphorylated levels of Akt, p70S6 kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Interestingly, daily treatment with AT1 receptor blocker  (50 mg/kg) significantly prevented Ang II-mediated aortic profilin-1 expression, , and peroxynitrite production in WT mice with enhanced ACE2 levels and the suppression of the Akt-ERK-eNOS signaling pathways.

Construction of concentration-response curves to Ang I and II in porcine femoral arteries, in the absence or presence of the AT(1) or AT(2) receptor antagonists  and PD123319, revealed that the approximately 2 fold difference in potency between Ang I and II was not due to stimulation of different AT receptor populations by exogenous and locally generated Ang II. 3. Measurement of Ang I and II and their metabolites at the time of vasoconstriction confirmed that, at equimolar application of Ang I and II, bath fluid Ang II during Ang I was approximately 18 times lower than during Ang II and that Ang II was by far the most important metabolite of Ang I. Tissue Ang II was 2.9+/-1.5% and 12.2+/-2.4% of the corresponding Ang I and II bath fluid levels, and was not affected by  or PD123319, suggesting that it was located extracellularly. 4. Since approximately 15% of tissue  consists of interstitial fluid, it can be calculated that interstitial Ang II levels during Ang II resemble bath fluid Ang II levels, whereas during Ang I they are 8.8 - 27 fold higher. Consequently at equimolar application of Ang I and II, the interstitial Ang II levels differ only 2 - 4 fold. 5. Interstitial, rather than circulating Ang II determines vasoconstriction.

Because AT(1) receptors have been described in the coronary microcirculation, we investigated whether ANG II contributes to the regulation of coronary vascular tone and whether its contribution is altered during exercise. Since the renin-angiotensin system is activated after myocardial infarction, resulting in an increase in circulating ANG II, we also investigated whether the contribution of ANG II to the regulation of vasomotor tone is altered after infarction. Twenty-six chronically instrumented swine were studied at rest and while running on a treadmill at 1-4 km/h. In 13 swine, myocardial infarction was induced by ligation of the left circumflex coronary artery. Blockade of AT(1) receptors (, 1 mg/kg iv) had no effect on myocardial O(2) consumption but resulted in an increase in coronary venous O(2) tension and saturation both at rest and during exercise, reflecting coronary vasodilation. Despite increased plasma levels of ANG II after infarction and maintained coronary arteriolar AT(1) receptor levels, the vasodilation evoked by  was significantly reduced both at rest and during exercise.

The method was linear in the range from LOQ (0.84μgg(-1)) to 101μgg(-1) of azide. The correlation coefficient was 0.9999 and bias on y-axis for 84μgg(-1) test concentration was 0.33%. The accuracy of the method was established based on the recovery obtained between 94.0% and 103.0% for azide. Standard and sample solutions were stable for at least 48h at room temperature and in refrigerator. The method was found to be robust for variation in column temperature (±5°C) and mobile phase flow rate (±0.2mLmin(-1)) and selective for anions such as bromide, nitrate, nitrite, formate and acetate.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Kidney podocytes have an essential role as a filtration barrier against proteinuria. Kruppel-like Factor 4 (KLF4) is expressed in podocytes and decreased in glomerular diseases leading to methylation of the nephrin promoter, decreased nephrin expression and proteinuria. Treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) reduced methylation of the nephrin promoter in murine glomeruli of an adriamycin nephropathy model with recovery of KLF4 expression and a decrease in albuminuria. In podocyte-specific KLF4 knockout mice, the effect of ARB on albuminuria and the nephrin promoter methylation was attenuated. In cultured human podocytes, angiotensin II reduced KLF4 expression and caused methylation of the nephrin promoter with decreased nephrin expression. In patients, nephrin promoter methylation was increased in proteinuric kidney diseases with decreased KLF4 and nephrin expression. KLF4 expression in ARB-treated patients was higher in patients with than without ARB treatment. Thus, angiotensin II can modulate epigenetic regulation in podocytes and ARB inhibits these actions in part via KLF4 in proteinuric kidney diseases. This study provides a new concept that renin-angiotensin system blockade can exert therapeutic effects through epigenetic modulation of the kidney gene expression.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23237398>[ in clinical practice].</a></h2><p> is a noncompetitive angiotensin II receptor type 1 antagonist which has been successfully used for more than 10 years for the treatment of hypertensive disease.

Although activators of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARalpha,gamma,delta) in various combinations are under development for treating the metabolic syndrome, they are hampered by adverse effects related to increased adipogenesis,  gain, fluid overload and carcinogenesis.

Emerging studies have revealed that both these drugs have beneficial metabolic profiles. This information provides a strategic rationale and pharmacological platform for the development of novel dual ARB/PPARgamma agonists to target the metabolic syndrome and its cardiovascular sequelae, for which therapy is presently insufficient or non-existent.

Since angiotensin II (ANG II) has been suggested to play an important role in liver inflammation and fibrosis, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether therapy against renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may provide some beneficial effect in liver of an animal model of metabolic syndrome.For 6 months, obese Zucker rats (OZRs) were treated as follows: OZR-group, OZR + Perindopril (P) group, OZR +  (IRB) group, OZR + Amlodipine (AML) group, and lean Zucker rats (LZRs) group as a control. Livers were evaluated by immunohistochemistry techniques using corresponding antibodies.All treated groups showed a similar reduction in blood pressure compared to untreated OZR. Therapy either with IRB or P improves insulin sensitivity and reduces hepatic enzyme level with respect to untreated OZR. Conversely, AML failed to modify both parameters. Untreated OZR displayed higher hepatic ANG II levels and steatosis together with a marked increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) level compared to LZR. Following RAS inhibition either by P or IRB, a significant reduction (P < 0.01) in the immunostaining of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and TGF-beta1 compared to untreated OZR was observed.These results indicate that ANG II expression is increased in the liver of these animals with steatohepatitis.

The hepatitis B surface antigen envelope protein protects the HDV nucleocapsid antigen and provides a means for the virus to enter and exit the hepatocyte. Hepatitis B and D viruses exploit the human sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP), a receptor, for their entry into hepatocytes. Prenylation of the large delta antigen is a critical determinant of HDV particle assembly. Treatment with pegylated interferon results in sustained virological response six months post-treatment in one fourth of the patients. Nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) have been widely tested in hepatitis delta, but they appear to be ineffective. Combination treatment of NAs with interferon also proved to be disappointing so there is a need for novel therapeutic options.

There are already some approved drugs available, including , ezetimibe, and ritonavir and cyclosporin A, with documented inhibitory effects on NTCP's  function. These drugs may have a role in HDV treatment. Interference with host-mediated post-translational changes of proteins that are crucial to the HDV life cycle, such as prenylation may become an important tool to control HDV infection and prevent replication.

The difference in daytime SBP was -11.5  mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) -15.4 to -7.5, P < 0.0001] in patients with acceptable medication adherence. In contrast, in patients with low medication adherence, the difference between groups was smaller and not significant (-9.4  mmHg, 95% CI -20.4 to 1.7, P = 0.09). Independently of BP changes, PWV and LVM decreased more in the SNB than in the SRASB arm when medication adherence was acceptable (-0.52 m/s, 95% CI -1.3 to -0.007, P = 0.047; and -24 g/m, 95% CI -36 to -12, P = 0.0003), whereas no significant changes were observed in low medication adherence patients.Medication adherence contributes to BP-lowering and regression of target organ damage.

Early diet-induced HC impairs renal perfusion responses, but it is yet unknown whether the AT1 receptor is involved. This study tested the hypothesis that AT1 receptor blockade improved renal perfusion and functional responses in hypercholesterolemic pigs.Regional renal hemodynamics and function in vivo were quantified bilaterally in pigs, at baseline and during vasoactive challenge (acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside), using electron beam computed tomography after 12 weeks of normal (n = 6) or HC diet (n = 6), or HC diet supplemented (100 mg/d) with the AT1-receptor antagonist  (HC + AT1, n = 6).Basal cortical and medullary perfusion was similar among the groups. Basal tubular function was similar on normal and HC diets, whereas HC + AT1 showed decreased proximal and distal fluid reabsorption. Hypercholesterolemic pigs had blunted cortical perfusion (P = .22) and augmented tubular responses to acetylcholine, whereas on HC + AT1 diet, cortical perfusion (P = .002) and tubular function were similar to normal animals. This was associated with decreased systemic levels of the oxidative stress markers thiobarbituric acid reactive substances.The AT1 receptor blockade in HC improves renal perfusion and tubular functional responses to endothelium-dependent vasodilators, in association with a decrease in oxidative stress.

Guidelines recommend five first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes, but compelling indications may indicate favoring one drug class over another. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have demonstrated a blood pressure lowering efficacy which is at least comparable with other drug classes, including ACE inhibitors (ACE-I), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and diuretics. They have, in addition, a lower side effect profile than other drug classes and patients on ARBs are more persistent with therapy. Compelling indications for the use of ARBs are heart failure, post-myocardial infarction, diabetic nephropathy, proteinuria/microalbuminuria, left ventricular hypertrophy, atrial fibrillation, metabolic syndrome and ACE-I induced cough. The ARB  has demonstrated a high efficacy in lowering blood pressure, which has been shown to be at least comparable with ACE-Is and superior to other ARBs such as losartan and valsartan.

Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal disease through blood pressure-independent mechanisms mediated by angiotensin II. Thus, inhibiting the RAS with either an ARB or an ACE inhibitor may confer additional benefit in people with advanced nephropathy that cannot be explained totally by reductions in blood pressure. Preclinical evidence suggests that blood pressure lowering is not solely responsible for the organ and tissue protective effects of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Furthermore, clinical studies evaluating effects on end organs and surrogate markers have shown that these agents have blood pressure-independent effects. There is also intriguing evidence that agents in the same class may differ in their effects on renal function despite similar blood pressure control. Support for blood pressure-independent effects comes from outcome studies. Agents evaluated in such studies and that appear to have effects independent of blood pressure lowering include , losartan, ramipril, and telmisartan. Taken together, this body of evidence indicates that the clinical benefits of ARBs and ACE inhibitors in patients with advanced nephropathy extend beyond blood pressure reduction. Therefore, although antihypertensive efficacy is of primary importance in choosing a treatment to provide cardiovascular and renal protection, consideration should be given to the effects of an agent that extend beyond blood pressure.Copyright  2010 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, we developed and optimized a new methodology for incorporating physical variability in pharmaceutical production based on the NIR spectrum for the process. Such a spectrum contains the spectral changes caused by each treatment applied to the component mixture during the production process. The proposed methodology involves adding a set of process spectra (viz. difference spectra between those for production tablets and a laboratory mixture of identical nominal composition) to the set of laboratory samples, which span the wanted concentration range, in order to construct a calibration set incorporating all physical changes undergone by the samples in each step of the production process. The best calibration model among those tested was selected by establishing the influence of spectral pretreatments used to obtain the process spectrum and construct the calibration models, and also by determining the multiplying factor m to be applied to the process spectra in order to ensure incorporation of all variability sources into the calibration model. The specific samples to be included in the calibration set were selected by principal component analysis (PCA). To this end, the new methodology for constructing calibration sets for determining the Active Principle Ingredients (API) and excipients was applied to  tablets and validated by application to the API and excipients of paracetamol tablets. The proposed methodology provides simple, robust calibration models for determining the different components of a pharmaceutical formulation.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

All SCDs were adjudicated by a clinical endpoint committee. Cumulative incidences of SCD were estimated counting other deaths as competing risks. Cox regression analysis was used to generate a risk model for SCD. During a mean follow-up of 4.1 years, 231 (5.6%) patients died suddenly and 650 (15.7%) died non-suddenly. A multivariable model in 3480 patients including age, gender, history of  and myocardial infarction, LBBB on ECG, and the natural logarithm of NT-proBNP identified a subgroup of 837 (24%) patients with ≥10% cumulative incidence of SCD over 5 years, accounting for other deaths as competing risk (Harrell's C index 0.75). The 5-year cumulative incidences of SCD in the higher and lower risk groups were 11% and 4%, respectively. In the higher risk group, 32% of deaths were SCD compared with 26% in the entire I-PRESERVE cohort.A multivariable prediction model identified patients with HFpEF who have a ≥10% risk of SCD over 5 years, similar to the risk of SCD in the Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure (SCD-Heft) trial.

However, the differences among them are still unclear. We designed this study to examine and compare the effects of several ARBs widely used in clinics, including Olmesartan, Candesartan, Telmisartan, Losartan, Valsartan and , on the ACE-AngII-AT1 axis and the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas axis during the development of cardiac remodeling after pressure overload. Although all of the six ARBs, attenuated the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) for 2 or 4weeks in the wild-type mice evaluated by echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements, the degree of attenuation by Olmesartan, Candesartan and Losartan tended to be larger than that of the other three drugs tested. Additionally, the degree of downregulation of the ACE-AngII-AT1 axis and upregulation of the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas axis was higher in response to Olmesartan, Candesartan and Losartan administration in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, in angiotensinogen-knockdown mice, TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure were inhibited by Olmesartan, Candesartan and Losartan but not by Telmisartan, Valsartan and  administration. Furthermore, only Olmesartan and Candesartan could downregulate the ACE-AngII-AT1 axis and upregulate the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas axis in vitro. Our data suggest that Olmesartan, Candesartan and Losartan could effectively inhibit pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling even when with knockdown of Ang II, possibly through upregulation of the expression of the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas axis and downregulation of the expression of the ACE-AngII-AT1 axis.

Renal denervation (RD) has been shown to improve cardiac function in HF, but the protective mechanisms remain unclear. The present study tested the hypothesis that RD ameliorates isoproterenol- (ISO-) induced HF through regulation of brain RAS and PICs. Chronic ISO infusion resulted in remarked decrease in blood pressure (BP) and increase in heart rate and cardiac dysfunction, which was accompanied by increased BP variability and decreased baroreflex sensitivity and HR variability. Most of these adverse effects of ISO on cardiac and autonomic function were reversed by RD. Furthermore, ISO upregulated mRNA and protein expressions of several components of the RAS and PICs in the lamina terminalis and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, two forebrain nuclei involved in cardiovascular regulations. RD significantly inhibited the upregulation of these genes. Either intracerebroventricular AT1-R antagonist, , or TNF- inhibitor, etanercept, mimicked the beneficial actions of RD in the ISO-induced HF. The results suggest that the RD restores autonomic balance and ameliorates ISO-induced HF and that the downregulated RAS and PICs in the brain contribute to these beneficial effects of RD.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797786>Suppressive effects of type I angiotensin receptor antagonists, candesartan and  on allergic asthma.</a></h2><p>The effects of candesartan and , antagonists of the type I angiotensin II receptor, were investigated on allergic asthma.

After chronic administration of  (21 days at 50 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), glucose tolerance was enhanced further, and insulin-mediated glucose transport was significantly elevated in both epitrochlearis (32%) and soleus (73%) muscle. Chronic angiotensin II receptor antagonism was associated with significant increases in glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4) protein expression in soleus (22%) and plantaris (20%) muscle and myocardium (15%). Chronic -induced increases in whole- insulin sensitivity were associated with increased insulin-mediated glucose transport in both epitrochlearis (r=-0.677; P<0.05) and soleus (r=-0.892; P<0.05) muscle. In summary, angiotensin II receptor (AT(1)-subtype) antagonism, either acutely or chronically, improves glucose tolerance, at least in part because of an enhancement in skeletal-muscle glucose transport, and the effect of chronic angiotensin II receptor antagonism on type I skeletal-muscle glucose uptake is associated with an increase in GLUT-4 protein expression.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30634212>[Regulatory Effect of Chinese Drugs for Stasis Removing and Collaterals Dredging on the Expres- sions of podocin and CD2AP in Podocyte Slit Diaphragm of Diabetic Nephropathy Rats].</a></h2><p>To observe the regulatory effect of Chinese drugs for stasis removing and collaterals dredging (CDSRCD) on the expressions of podocin and CD2AP in podocyte slit diaphragm (SD) of diabetic nephropathy (DN) rats.DN rat model was duplicated in 40 male Sprague- Dawley rats by feeding high fat high glucose diet combined with intraperitoneally injecting 1 % streptozoto- cin (STZ, 35 mg/kg). Totally 36 successfully modeled rats were divided into the model group, the CD- SRCD group,- and the  group according to random digit table, 12 in each group.

Rats in the normal group and the mod- el group were fed with equal volume of distilled water at the same time. 24 h urine protein quantitation was detected using ELISA at various time points. Body weight (BW) , kidney weight ( KW), kidney index (KI) , fasting blood glucose (FBG) , serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and uric acid (UA) in each group were detected after 16 weeks of intervention. The pathomorphological changes of re- nal tissue were observed under light microscope and electron microscope respectively. The protein and mRNA expressions of podocin and CD2AP were detected by Western blot and Real-time PCR respectively.(1) Compared with the normal group, 24 h urine protein quantitation significantly increased at week 4, 8, 12, and 16, respectively (P <0. 01). BW was decreased; KI and levels of FBG, SCr, BUN, and UA all increased after modeling (P <0. 01). Compared with the model group, 24 h urine protein quan- titation significantly decreased in the CDSRCD group and the  group at week 4, 8, 12, and 16, respectively (P <0. 01). Besides, it was more obviously reduced in the CDSRCD group than in the irbe- sartan group (P <0. 05, P <0.01). BUN level obviously decreased both in the CDSRCD group and the  group after modeling (P <0. 05, P <0. 01).

All these pathological changes were attenuated in the CD- SRCD group and the  group to some degree. (3) Results of Western blot and Real-time PCR showed, compared with the normal group, protein and mRNA expressions of podocin and CD2AP decreased in the model group (P <0. 01). Compared with the model group, protein and mRNA expressions of podocin and CD2AP increased in the CDSRCD group and the  group (P <0. 01). Protein and mRNA expressions of podocin and CD2AP increased more in the CDSRCD group than in the  group (P <0. 05).CDSRCD could protect renal function by lowering urinary protein in DN rats, improve renal pathological changes.

In addition, the administration of selective AII type 1 receptor blockers has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity. However, only a few studies have addressed the molecular mechanisms involved in this association. Furthermore, in a previous study we illustrated that obese Zucker rats (OZR) present increased serine 994 (Ser994) phosphorylation of hepatic insulin receptor, and this event seems to be implicated in the regulation of the intrinsic IRK in this model of insulin resistance.We examined the effects of chronic treatment with  (50 mg/kg a day for 6 months) on the hepatic insulin signaling system of OZR.The extent of phosphorylation of several components of the insulin signaling system was assessed by immunoprecipitation, followed by immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibodies. In addition, liver AII levels and fat deposits were determined by immunohistochemistry and Oil red O, respectively.OZR displayed a marked attenuation in the in-vivo phosphorylation of several components of the insulin signaling pathways in the liver, together with significantly higher hepatic AII levels and hepatic steatosis when compared with lean Zucker rats. We found that in the livers of OZR long-term administration of  is associated with: (i) increased insulin-stimulated insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation; (ii) decreased insulin receptor Ser994 phosphorylation; (iii) augmented insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1 and 2 abundance and tyrosine phosphorylation; (iv) augmented association between IRS and the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; (v) increased insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation; and (vi) decreased hepatic steatosis.The present study provides substantial information that demonstrates that long-term selective AII blockade by  improves insulin signaling and is associated with decreased insulin receptor Ser994 phosphorylation in the liver of a representative animal model of the human metabolic syndrome.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30701915>Chronic kidney disease as a multidisciplinary problem of contemporary medicine.</a></h2><p>A review deals with the problem of chronic kidney disease (CKD) from the position of a physician and cardiologist.

These could be particularly relevant in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), where most patients show features of the metabolic syndrome and are prescribed with combined chronic therapies, which can contribute to . However, specific biomarkers to assess the contribution of drugs to NAFLD are lacking. We aimed to find microRNAs (miRNAs) responsive to steatotic drugs and to investigate if they could become circulating biomarkers for drug-induced steatosis.  Human HepG2 cells were treated with drugs and changes in miRNA levels were measured by microarray and qRT-PCR. Drug-induced fat accumulation in HepG2 was analyzed by high-content screening and enzymatic methods. miRNA biomarkers were also analyzed in the sera of 44 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients and in 10 controls.  We found a set of 10 miRNAs [miR-22-5p, -3929, -24-2-5p, -663a, -29a-3p, -21 (5p and 3p), -27a-5p, -1260 and -202-3p] that were induced in human HepG2 cells and secreted to the culture medium upon incubation with model steatotic drugs (valproate, doxycycline, cyclosporin A and tamoxifen). Moreover, cell exposure to 17 common drugs for NAFLD patients showed that some of them (e.g., , fenofibrate, and omeprazole) also induced these miRNAs and increased intracellular triglycerides, particularly in combinations. Finally, we found that most of these miRNAs (60%) were detected in human serum, and that NAFLD patients under fibrates showed both induction of these miRNAs and a more severe steatosis grade.  Steatotic drugs induce a common set of hepatic miRNAs that could be used in drug screening during preclinical development. Moreover, most of these miRNAs are serum circulating biomarkers that could become useful in the diagnosis of iatrogenic steatosis.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17928967>[Albuminuria: an indicator of cardiovascular risk].</a></h2><p>The transition of albumin from the vascular lumen into the surrounding tissue always indicates a serious disturbance of the vascular wall. Clinically, this process can be recognized as "cotton-wool" spots of the retina or by testing the urine for the presence of albumin. The appearance of albumin in the urine is pathologic and should be evaluated within the context of the accompanying cardiovascular risk.Albumin transition is indicative of a disturbance of the   of endothelial cells. In the kidney, damage to podocytes, mesangial and endothelial cells, a loss of charge selectivity, and an altered expression of matrix proteins can be observed. However, vascular alterations are not confined to the kidney but can also be observed in the myocardium. Even though thresholds for microalbuminuria (> 30 mg/24 h) and proteinuria (> 300 mg/24 h) have been arbitrarily defined, an increase in risk starts at much lower levels of albumin excretion.The prevalence of microalbuminuria in the general population is about 8%. However, prevalence rates of > 50% have been observed in high-risk groups, which are accompanied by an increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.A number of therapeutic options (tight blood sugar control, blood pressure reduction, lipid lowering) lead to a reduction of albuminuria and an improvement in cardiovascular prognosis. This has particularly been described for renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-(RAAS-)blocking agents. Their use is not only associated with a reduced risk of end-organ damage (heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, cerebrovascular events) but has been described to decrease mortality as well.A timely diagnosis, a consecutive cardiovascular diagnostic work-up and the subsequent use of RAAS-blocking agents is indicated in patients in whom albuminuria has been diagnosed.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30788923>[Effects of  on Notch1 signaling pathway in diabetic rats with myocardial injury].</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects and mechanisms of  on myocardial injury in diabetic rats, and to analyze the changes of Notch1 signaling pathway in it.Thirty rats were randomly divided into four groups:normal control group (CON, =6), high calorie group (HC, =6) and diabetes mellitus group (DM, =9),  + diabetes group (Ir + DM, =9).

This study evaluated the relative activity factor (RAF) approach to extrapolate active uptake clearance in transporter-transfected cell systems (CL) to that in human hepatocyte suspensions (PS). RAF values for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 were determined in two batches of cryopreserved human hepatocytes using estrone-3-sulfate and cholecystokinin octapeptide as reference substrates, respectively. Fourteen OATP1B substrate drugs selected (atorvastatin, bosentan, cerivastatin, fexofenadine, fluvastatin, glibenclamide, , nateglinide, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, telmisartan, torasemide, and valsartan) showed temperature-dependent uptake in human hepatocytes. In transporter-transfected cells, OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated uptake was observed in all compounds except for telmisartan. RAF-based net CL was mainly accounted for by OATP1B1 (72.3-99.7%) and fell within the 3-fold of PS observed in human hepatocytes in 11 out of 13 compounds (excluding telmisartan). This study demonstrated that the RAF approach provides a quantitative index of OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated PS in human hepatocytes, which will facilitate the optimization of the pharmacokinetic properties of OATP1B substrates at nonclinical stages of drug development.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25036239>Commentary for Clancy, P et al., ARBs and ERK activation: new insights on human atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22747614>Aggressive blood pressure-lowering therapy guided by home blood pressure monitoring improves target organ damage in hypertensive patients with type 2 /prediabetes.</a></h2><p>The authors tested the hypothesis that an aggressive antihypertensive treatment is beneficial in protecting against target organ damage (TOD) in patients with type 2 /prediabetes.

We investigated the presence of AT1R, AT2R, and MasR in aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), a condition featuring hyperaldosteronism, and in APA-adjacent tissue. The effect of Compound 21 (C21), an AT2R agonist, on CYP11B1 (cortisol synthase) and CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase) gene expression in NCI-H295R and HAC15 cell lines, and in APA and APA-adjacent tissue, was also assessed using the AT1R antagonist  to ascertain the specificity of C21 effect. We found that the AT1R, AT2R, and MasR were expressed in APA and APA-adjacent tissue, albeit heterogeneously. The gene expression of AT1R and AT2R was lower, and that of the MasR higher in APAs than in APA-adjacent tissue. In steroid-producing NCI-H295R and HAC15 cell lines, and in APA and APA-adjacent tissue, C21 was ineffective at nanomolar concentrations, but increased CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 gene expression at micromolar concentrations through AT1R, as this effect was blunted by . The scant expression of the AT2R, along with the lack of any effect of C21 at low concentrations on CYP11B2, do not support the contention that the protective arm of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blunts aldosterone synthase in the normal adrenal cortex and primary aldosteronism.© 2018 The Author(s).
