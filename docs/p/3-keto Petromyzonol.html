However, no known pheromone molecule has been shown to modulate directly the synthesis or release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), the main regulator of the HPG axis. We selected sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) as a model system to determine whether a single pheromone component alters the output of GnRH.Sea lamprey male sex pheromones contain a main component, 7α, 12α, 24-trihydroxy-5α-cholan-3-one 24-sulfate (- sulfate or 3kPZS), which has been shown to modulate behaviors of mature females. Through a series of experiments, we tested the hypothesis that 3kPZS modulates both synthesis and release of GnRH, and subsequently, HPG output in immature sea lamprey.The results showed that natural male pheromone mixtures induced differential steroid responses but facilitated sexual maturation in both sexes of immature animals (χ(2) = 5.042, dF = 1, p < 0.05). Exposure to 3kPZS increased plasma 15α-hydroxyprogesterone (15α-P) concentrations (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05) and brain gene expressions (genes examined: three lamprey (l) GnRH-I transcripts, lGnRH-III, Jun and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK); one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05), but did not alter the number of GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus in immature animals. In addition, 3kPZS treatments increased lGnRH peptide concentrations in the forebrain and modulated their levels in plasma. Overall, 3kPZS modulation of HPG axis is more pronounced in immature males than in females.We conclude that a single male pheromone component primes the HPG axis in immature sea lamprey in a sexually dimorphic manner.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12460600>Development and application of an ELISA for a sex pheromone released by the male sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus L.).</a></h2><p>An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed for a conjugated bile acid, 7alpha,12alpha,24-trihydroxy-5alpha-cholan-3-one 24-sulfate (commonly referred to as   sulfate [3kPZS]), a pheromone released by reproductively mature male sea lampreys to attract sexually mature females. A polyclonal antiserum against the pheromone was raised by injecting   24-hemisuccinate (3kPZ-HS) conjugated to bovine serum albumin into rabbits. The enzyme label was prepared by conjugating 3kPZ-HS to acetylcholinesterase. The standard curve had a working range of 20 pg-10 ng/well. Intra- and inter-assay variations were less than 5 and 12%, respectively. The antiserum had 100% cross-reaction with   and  allocholic acid but less than 0.2% cross-reaction with , allocholic acid, cholic acid, and taurolithocholic acid sulfate. The assay was applied to water which had been conditioned for 4h by either larvae, parasitic juveniles, ovulating females, pre-spermiating males, or spermiating males. Immunoactive material (average 200 ng/ml, which is equivalent to 500 microg animal/h) was only found in water from the reproductively mature males and diluted parallel with the standard curve. Assay of water samples collected from male lampreys in bisected aquaria also established that 99.6% of the immunoactive material emanated from the front end of the fish. This assay has applications in both physiological and ecological aspects of sea lamprey reproduction.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14689221>Electrophysiological evidence for detection and discrimination of pheromonal bile acids by the olfactory epithelium of female sea lampreys ( Petromyzon marinus).</a></h2><p>Electro-olfactograms were used to determine sensitivity and specificity of olfactory organs of female sea lampreys ( Petromyzon marinus) to four bile acids:   sulfate and  allocholic acid from spermiating males and  sulfate and allocholic acid from larvae. Spermiating male bile acids are thought to function as a mating pheromone and larval bile acids as a migratory pheromone. The response threshold was 10(-12) mol l(-1) for   sulfate and 10(-10) mol l(-1) for the other bile acids. At concentrations above 10(-9) mol l(-1), the sulfated bile acids showed almost identical potency, as did the non-sulfated bile acids. The two sulfated bile acids were more potent than the two non-sulfated ones. In addition,   sulfate and water conditioned with spermiating males induced similar concentration-response curves and response thresholds. Cross-adaptation experiments demonstrated that the sulfated and non-sulfated bile acids represent different odors to the olfactory epithelium of females. Further exploration revealed that   sulfate represents a different odor than  sulfate, while  allocholic acid and allocholic acid represent the same odor. Results indicate that male-specific bile acids are potent and specific stimulants to the female olfactory organ, supporting the previous hypothesis that these bile acids function as a pheromone.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23874530>Characterization of a novel bile alcohol sulfate released by sexually mature male sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus).</a></h2><p>A sulphate-conjugated bile alcohol, 3,12-diketo-4,6-petromyzonene-24-sulfate (DKPES), was identified using bioassay-guided fractionation from water conditioned with sexually mature male sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). The structure and relative stereochemistry of DKPES was established using spectroscopic data. The electro-olfactogram (EOG) response threshold of DKPES was 10(-7) Molar (M) and that of   sulfate (3 KPZS; a known component of the male sea lamprey sex pheromone) was 10(-10) M. Behavioural studies indicated that DKPES can be detected at low concentrations by attracting sexually mature females to nests when combined with 3 KPZS. Nests baited with a mixture of DKPES and 3 KPZS (ratio 1∶29.8) attracted equal numbers of sexually mature females compared to an adjacent nest baited with 3 KPZS alone. When DKPES and 3 KPZS mixtures were applied at ratios of 2∶29.8 and 10∶29.8, the proportion of sexually mature females that entered baited nests increased to 73% and 70%, respectively. None of the sexually mature females released were attracted to nests baited with DKPES alone. These results indicated that DKPES is a component of the sex pheromone released by sexually mature male sea lamprey, and is the second biologically active compound identified from this pheromone. DKPES represents the first example that a minor component of a vertebrate pheromone can be combined with a major component to elicit critical sexual behaviors. DKPES holds considerable promise for increasing the effectiveness of pheromone-baited trapping as a means of sea lamprey control in the Laurentian Great Lakes.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22104518>Multiplex quantification of lamprey specific bile acid derivatives in environmental water using UHPLC-MS/MS.</a></h2><p>Larval and adult sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) release bile salts and acids into the surrounding aquatic environment. Some of these bile salts and acids, such as  sulfate (PZS),   sulfate (3k PZS), petromyzonamine disulfate (PADS), petromyzosterol disulfate (PSDS), and  allocholic acid (3k ACA), may function as pheromones. To examine the release and distribution patterns of these metabolites, which this study has termed bile acid derivatives, we developed a novel UHPLC-MS/MS method that was characterized by simple sample preparation, baseline separation, and short analysis time for all studied compounds. These five analytes were separated in 7 min using a reversed-phase C18 column containing 1.7 μm particles and a gradient elution at pH 8.9. Once separated, the analytes were subjected to electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (negative ion mode) and collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (CID-MS/MS) using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Deuterated 3k PZS ([(2)H(5)]3k PZS) was added as the internal standard (IS) to the sample prior to solid phase extraction (SPE). Among the three types of SPE sorbent tested, mixed-mode cation-exchange and reversed-phase sorbent for bases (MAX) and acids (MCX), and reversed-phase C18 sorbent (Sep-pak), the best recoveries (84.1-99.7%) were obtained with MCX cartridges. The calibration curves of all five analytes were linear between 0.15 and 1200 ng/mL, with R(2)≥0.9997. This method had a precision of relative standard deviation (RSD) ≤9.9% and an accuracy of deviation (DEV) ≥92.5%. The developed method was successfully used to quantify bile acid derivatives found in streams where lampreys spawn (SD<1.4) and water conditioned with male sea lampreys (SD<4.8). Utilizing this method provides a routine analysis of lamprey bile acid derivatives and may prove useful for sea lamprey population estimates in future studies and applications.Copyright © 2011.

Accordingly, these models predict that females of related taxa possessing the ancestral state of signalling evolved preference for the male trait in a non-sexual context. We postulated that female preference for the male-released bile alcohol mating pheromone,   sulfate (3kPZS), of the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) evolved as a result of a receiver bias. In particular, we propose that migratory silver lamprey (Ichthyomyzon unicuspis), a basal member of the Petromyzontidae, evolved a preference for 3kPZS released by stream-resident larvae as a means of identifying productive habitat for offspring. Larval silver lamprey released 3kPZS at rates sufficient to be detected by migratory lampreys. Females responded to 3kPZS by exhibiting upstream movement behaviours relevant in a migratory context, but did not exhibit proximate behaviours important to mate search and spawning. Male silver lamprey did not release 3kPZS at rates sufficient to be detected by females in natural high-volume stream environments. We infer that female silver lamprey cue onto 3kPZS excreted by stream-resident larvae as a mechanism to locate habitat conducive to offspring survival and that males do not signal with 3kPZS. We suggest that this female preference for a male signal in a non-sexual context represents a bias leading to the sexual signalling observed in sea lamprey.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15666352> sulfate and its derivatives: the chemoattractants of the sea lamprey.</a></h2><p> sulfate (PZS) and -PZS are bile alocohol derivatives that serve as chemoattractants during the life cycle of sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). The sulfonate moiety is crucial perhaps conferring the required solubility for the pheromone that is released into the streams and for the specificity to bind to its receptor. During the life cycle of lamprey, larvae produce copious amounts of 5 alpha-cholan-PZS, and trace amounts of allocholic acid (ACA), which attracts adults to the same breeding ground. Later the spermeating males produce 3keto-PZS, and trace amounts of -ACA, which attracts the ovulating females, signaling both its reproductive status and its nesting location for successful reproduction. In both stages, a mixture of components serves as pheromone plume, similar to insects. The receptors for the migratory and the reproductive pheromones need to be molecularly cloned and characterized in order to understand the molecular biology of olfaction in the sea lamprey.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12606376>Male sea lampreys, Petromyzon marinus L., excrete a sex pheromone from gill epithelia.</a></h2><p>During the period when they are producing sperm, male sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus L.) release a sex pheromone 7alpha, 12alpha, 24-trihydroxy-5alpha-cholan-3-one-24-sulfate (- sulfate, 3ketoPZS) that induces search and preference behaviors in ovulating females. In this study, we conducted a series of experiments to demonstrate that release of this pheromone into water takes place exclusively through the gills. In a behavioral maze, water conditioned with the anterior region of spermiating males induced an increase of search and preference behaviors in ovulating females. Similar behavior was not elicited by water conditioned by the posterior region. The anterior region washings and whole-body washings from spermiating males also elicited large and virtually identical electro-olfactogram responses from female sea lampreys, while the posterior washings produced negligible responses. Further, mass spectrometry and immunoassay confirmed that virtually all the 3ketoPZS released into water was through the gills. Immunocytochemistry revealed some gill epithelial cells and hepatocytes from spermiating males contained dense immunoreactive 3ketoPZS, but not those from prespermiating males. These results demonstrate that 3ketoPZS is released through the gill epithelia and suggest that this pheromone or its precursor may be produced in the liver.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24188124>Biosynthesis and release of pheromonal bile salts in mature male sea lamprey.</a></h2><p>In vertebrates, bile salts are primarily synthesized in the liver and secreted into the intestine where they aid in absorption of dietary fats. Small amounts of bile salts that are not reabsorbed into enterohepatic circulation are excreted with waste. In sexually mature male sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus L.) a bile salt is released in large amounts across gill epithelia into water where it functions as a pheromone. We postulate that the release of this pheromone is associated with a dramatic increase in its biosynthesis and transport to the gills upon sexual maturation.We show an 8000-fold increase in transcription of cyp7a1, a three-fold increase in transcription of cyp27a1, and a six-fold increase in transcription of cyp8b1 in the liver of mature male sea lamprey over immature male adults. LC-MS/MS data on tissue-specific distribution and release rates of bile salts from mature males show a high concentration of  sulfate (PZS) in the liver and gills of mature males.   sulfate (3kPZS, known as a male sex pheromone) is the primary compound released from gills, suggesting a conversion of PZS to 3kPZS in the gill epithelium. The PZS to 3kPZS conversion is supported by greater expression of hsd3b7 in gill epithelium. High expression of sult2b1 and sult2a1 in gill epithelia of mature males, and tissue-specific expression of bile salt transporters such as bsep, slc10a1, and slc10a2, suggest additional sulfation and transport of bile salts that are dependent upon maturation state.This report presents a rare example where specific genes associated with biosynthesis and release of a sexual pheromone are dramatically upregulated upon sexual maturation in a vertebrate. We provide a well characterized example of a complex mechanism of bile salt biosynthesis and excretion that has likely evolved for an additional function of bile salts as a mating pheromone.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24920007>Pheromone 3kPZS evokes context-dependent serotonin sexual dimorphism in the brain of the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus).</a></h2><p>Mature male sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) release a sex pheromone, - sulfate (3kPZS), that induces sexually dimorphic behavioral responses in conspecifics. However, the neural mechanism of such responses is mostly unknown. We examined the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and the expression of 5-HT1A receptors in the forebrain and brainstem of sea lamprey exposed to the vehicle (0.91 ppm methanol) or 10(-10) M 3kPZS for 2 h using high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Exposure to 3kPZS for 2 h increased 5-HT concentration in the forebrain of adult females, whereas 5-HT was not detected in the forebrain of adult males. On the contrary, 3kPZS exposure decreased 5-HT concentration in the brainstem of adult females and had no effect in adult males. Pheromone exposure evoked context-dependent sexual dimorphism in brain 5-HT1A receptor immunoreactivity, but had no effect on 5-HT1A mRNA concentrations in the brain with 2 h exposure time. It appears that in sea lamprey pheromone 3kPZS affects the 5-HT system in the brain in a context-dependent, sexually dimorphic manner.© 2014 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25623147>Evidence that progestins play an important role in spermiation and pheromone production in male sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus).</a></h2><p>Progestins (progestogens, C21 steroids) have been shown to regulate key physiological activities for reproduction in both sexes in all classes of vertebrates except for Agnathans. Progesterone (P) and 15α-hydroxyprogesterone (15α-P) have been detected in sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) plasma, but the expression patterns and functions of putative progestin receptor genes have not yet been investigated. The first objective of this study was to determine the differences in mRNA expression levels of nuclear progestin receptor (nPR) and the membrane receptor adaptor protein 'progesterone receptor membrane component 1' (pgrmc1) in putative target tissues in males at different life stages, with and without lamprey GnRH-I and -III treatment. The second objective was to demonstrate the function of progestins by implanting prespermiating males (PSM) with time-release pellets of P and measuring the latency to the onset of spermiation and plasma concentrations of sex pheromones and steroids. The third objective was to measure the binding affinity of P in the nuclear and membrane fractions of the target tissues. Expression levels of nPR and pgrmc1 differed between life stages and tissues, and in some cases were differentially responsive to lamprey GnRH-I and -III. Increases in nPR and pgrmc1 gene expressions were correlated to the late stages of sexual maturation in males. The highest expression levels of these genes were found in the liver and gill of spermiating males. These organs are, respectively, the site of production and release of the sex pheromone - sulfate (3kPZS). The hypothesis that pheromone production may be under hormonal control was tested in vivo by implanting PSM with time-release pellets of P. Concentrations of 3kPZS in plasma after 1week were 50-fold higher than in controls or in males that had been implanted with androstenedione, supporting the hypothesis that P is responsible for regulating the production of the sex pheromone. P treatment also accelerated the onset of spermiation. Saturation and Scatchard analyses of the target tissues showed that both nuclear and membrane fractions bound P with high affinity and low capacity (KD 0.53pmol/g testis and 0.22 pmol/g testis, and Bmax 1.8 and 5.7 nM, respectively), similar to the characteristics of nPR and mPR in other fish. The fact that a high proportion of P was also converted in vivo to 15α-P means that it is not yet possible to determine which of these two steroids is the natural ligand in the sea lamprey.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, few are identified in vertebrates, leaving the evolutionary mechanisms underlying vertebrate pheromones poorly understood. Pre-existing biases in receivers' perceptual systems shape visual and auditory signalling systems, but studies on how receiver biases influence the evolution of pheromone communication remain sparse. The lamprey Petromyzon marinus uses a relatively well-understood suite of pheromones and offers a unique opportunity to study the evolution of vertebrate pheromone communication. Previous studies indicate that male signalling with the mating pheromone   sulphate (3kPZS) may exploit a nonsexual attraction to juvenile-released 3kPZS that guides migration into productive rearing habitat. Here, we infer the distribution of male signalling with 3kPZS using a phylogenetic comparison comprising six of 10 genera and two of three families. Our results indicate that only P. marinus and Ichthyomyzon castaneus release 3kPZS at high rates. Olfactory and behavioural assays with P. marinus, I. castaneus and a subset of three other species that do not use 3kPZS as a sexual signal indicate that male signalling might have driven the evolution of female adaptations to detect 3kPZS with specific olfactory mechanisms and respond to 3kPZS with targeted attraction relevant during mate search. We postulate that 3kPZS communication evolved independently in I. castaneus and P. marinus, but cannot eliminate the alternative that other species lost 3kPZS communication. Regardless, our results represent a rare macroevolutionary investigation of a vertebrate pheromone and provide insight into the evolutionary mechanisms underlying pheromone communication.© 2017 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.
