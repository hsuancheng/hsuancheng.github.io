The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of diets supplemented with cooked red lentils on the colonic microenvironment (microbiota composition and activity and epithelial barrier integrity and function). C57Bl/6 male mice were fed one of five diets: a control basal diet (BD), a BD-supplemented diet with 5, 10 or 20% cooked red lentils (by weight), or a BD-supplemented diet with 0.7% pectin (equivalent soluble fiber level as found in the 20% lentil diet). Red lentil supplementation resulted in increased: (1) fecal microbiota α-diversity; (2) abundance of short-chain fatty  (SCFA)-producing bacteria (e.g.,  and ); (3) concentrations of fecal SCFAs; (4) mRNA expression of SCFA receptors (G-protein-coupled receptors () and /adherens  proteins (Zona Occulden-1 (), Claudin-2, E-cadherin). Overall, 20% lentil had the greatest impact on colon health outcomes, which were in part explained by a change in the soluble and insoluble fiber profile of the diet. These results support recent public health recommendations to increase consumption of plant-based protein foods for improved health, in particular intestinal health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31119823>In situ molecular characterization of endoneurial microvessels that form the blood-nerve barrier in normal human adult peripheral nerves.</a></h1><p>The blood-nerve barrier (BNB) formed by -forming endoneurial microvessels located in the innermost compartment of peripheral nerves, and the perineurium serve to maintain the internal microenvironment required for normal signal transduction. The specific molecular components that define the normal adult human BNB are not fully known. Guided by data derived from the adult human BNB transcriptome, we evaluated the in situ expression of 25 junctional complex, transporter, cell membrane, and cytoskeletal proteins in four histologically normal adult sural nerves by indirect fluorescent immunohistochemistry to determine proteins specifically expressed by restrictive endoneurial microvascular endothelium. Using Ulex Europaeus Agglutinin-1 expression to detect endothelial cells, we ascertained that the selected proteins were uniformly expressed in ≥90% of endoneurial microvessels. P-glycoprotein (also known as adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily B member 1) and solute carrier family 1 member 1 demonstrated restricted expression by endoneurial endothelium only, with classic  protein claudin-5 also expressed on fenestrated epineurial macrovessels, and vascular-specific adherens  protein cadherin-5 also expressed by the perineurium. The expression profiles of the selected proteins provide significant insight into the molecular composition of normal adult peripheral nerves. Further work is required to elucidate the human adult BNB molecular signature in order to better understand its development and devise strategies to restore function in peripheral neuropathies.© 2019 Peripheral Nerve Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581480>Apoptotic Fragmentation of Tricellulin.</a></h1><p>Apoptotic extrusion of cells from epithelial cell layers is of central importance for epithelial homeostasis. As a prerequisite cell-cell contacts between apoptotic cells and their neighbors have to be dissociated. Tricellular  (tTJs) represent specialized structures that seal polarized epithelial cells at sites where three cells meet and are characterized by the specific expression of tricellulin and angulins. Here, we specifically addressed the fate of tricellulin in apoptotic cells.Apoptosis was induced by staurosporine or camptothecin in MDCKII and RT-112 cells. The fate of tricellulin was analyzed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Caspase activity was inhibited by Z-VAD-FMK or Z-DEVD-FMK.Induction of apoptosis induces the degradation of tricellulin with time. Aspartate residues 487 and 441 were identified as caspase cleavage-sites in the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of human tricellulin. Fragmentation of tricellulin was inhibited in the presence of caspase inhibitors or when Asp487 or Asp441 were mutated to asparagine. Deletion of the tricellulin C-terminal amino  prevented binding to lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR)/angulin-1 and thus should impair specific localization of tricellulin to tTJs.Tricellulin is a substrate of caspases and its cleavage in consequence contributes to the dissolution of tTJs during apoptosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351968>Berberine induces ZIP14 expression and modulates zinc redistribution to protect intestinal mucosal barrier during polymicrobial sepsis.</a></h1><p>The present study investigated if berberine might induce Zrt-Irt-like protein 14 (ZIP14) and affect zinc redistribution to protect intestinal barrier in sepsis.Rodent model of sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Plasma endotoxin was assayed by LAL test and plasma zinc was measured by flame atomic spectrophotometer. Gut mucosal permeability was determined by plasma FITC-dextran. Zinc content and ZIP14 mRNA in gut mucosa were assayed by spectrophotometer and qRT-PCR, respectively.  integrity of Caco-2 was evaluated by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER).  (TJ) protein expression was detected by Western blotting.Berberine and zinc gluconate pretreatment to CLP rats improved survival rate, reduced plasma endotoxin level, alleviated hypozincemia, increased zinc accumulation and ZIP14 mRNA expression in the intestinal mucosa. Berberine and zinc gluconate pretreatment decreased CLP-elicited intestinal hyperpermeability to FITC-dextran. These effects of berberine in vivo were abolished by AG1024. In vitro, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) repressed zinc transfer into Caco-2 cells exposed to zinc gluconate. Berberine and IGF-I treatment increased ZIP14 protein expression and promoted zinc transfer into Caco-2 cells exposed to zinc gluconate plus LPS. Berberine treatment induced TJ protein (claudin-1 and occludin) and raised TEER in LPS-treated Caco-2 cells. These effects of berberine in vitro were partially inhibited by ZIP14 siRNA.The present study reveals that berberine induces ZIP14 expression and affects zinc re- distribution to protect intestinal barrier in sepsis, which is partially linked with the activation of IGF-I signaling.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The results revealed that AA-2βG had palliating effects on DSS-induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in terms of slowing down the trends of body weight and solid fecal mass loss, reducing colitis disease activity index, improving serum physiological and biochemical indicators, increasing colon length, blocking proinflammatory cytokines, and increasing  proteins. Additionally, AA-2βG treatment could promote the production of short-chain fatty  and modulate the composition of the gut microbiota. The key bacteria related to IBD were found to be Porphyromonadaceae, Prevotellaceae, Rikenellaceae, ,  and .

The underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), an enzyme involved in arachidonic  metabolism, has been reported to cause airway epithelial injury and thus may further promote the EMT. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of ALOX15 during the EMT process in CRSwNP.A total of 54 samples were obtained, including 10 from healthy control, 16 from non-eosinophilic CRSwNP, and 28 from eosinophilic CRSwNP. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to determine the basement membrane (BM) thickness. The concentration of molecules mediating remodeling was assayed by Luminex. The messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of target genes were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting.EMT was enhanced in eosinophilic CRSwNP compared with the healthy controls and non-eosinophilic CRSwNP infiltrated with lymphocytes and/or plasma cells. The expression pattern of molecules related to remodeling, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) family members, differed between the subtypes of CRSwNP. The mRNA level of ALOX15 was correlated with the BM thickness and MMP-1 and TGF-β3 expression. The inhibition of ALOX15 by PD146176 could induce claudin-1, claudin-4, claudin-7, zonula occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-2, E-Cadherin, TIMP-1, and TIMP-3 expressions and reduce the levels of MMP-1 and N-Cadherin in epithelial cells acquired from eosinophilic CRSwNP patients.The specific inhibition of ALOX15 could attenuate the EMT, which may provide an alternative method for the treatment of CRSwNP.© 2018 ARS-AAOA, LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31178173>Antioxidative effect of Lactobacillus plantarum Y44 on 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (ABAP)-damaged Caco-2 cells.</a></h1><p>Some Lactobacillus strains have been reported to have antioxidative activity. In our previous work, we screened Lactobacillus plantarum Y44 for its antioxidative activity. In this study, we further studied the antioxidative activities of L. plantarum Y44 using chemical antioxidant methods, including the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic ) free radical scavenging assays, the ferric reducing antioxidant power test, and oxygen radical absorbance capacity test, and we assessed damage caused by 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (ABAP) in a Caco-2 cell model. The results of the chemical antioxidant assays confirmed the antioxidative activity of L. plantarum Y44, which was consistent with the protection of Caco-2 cells against ABAP injury by L. plantarum Y44. We also found that L. plantarum Y44 significantly promoted expression of Nrf2 pathway-associated proteins, downregulated expression of inflammatory-related cytokines IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α in ABAP-damaged Caco-2 cells, and enhanced expression of the  proteins β-catenin and E-cadherin. We determined that L. plantarum Y44 exerted antioxidative effects by quenching oxygen free radicals and activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway in Caco-2 cells.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The objective of this study was to identify the target gene of miR-431 and to investigate the role of the miR-431-FOXA1 axis in the pathophysiology of NEC. The target gene of miR-431 was identified by in silico target prediction bioinformatics, luciferase assay, and Western blotting. Effects of miR-431 on downstream expression signals, cell proliferation, and apoptosis were investigated by overexpression in Caco-2 cells upon stimulation by LPS or lipoteichoic  (LTA). FOXA1 was identified as the target gene of miR-431. Overexpression of miR-431 in Caco-2 cells significantly inhibited FOXA1, ESRRG, and HNF4A and activated IL-6, LGR5, NFKB2, PLA2G2A, PRKCZ, and TNF. IL-8 and - 10 were enhanced when costimulated with LPS or LTA. These potential downstream genes were also significantly dysregulated in primary NEC tissues compared with surgical-control tissues. Overexpression of miR-431 significantly decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of Caco-2 cells. A proposed network of miR-431-FOXA1 interaction with LPS and LTA receptors demonstrates dysregulation of transcription factors, inflammatory mediators, epithelium  regulators, and cell proliferation and apoptosis signals. The miR-431-FOXA1 axis could in part be responsible for the intensification of the inflammatory response in NEC tissues and contribute to the proinflammatory pathophysiology.-Wu, Y. Z., Chan, K. Y.

Dry eye is one of the most frequent ocular disorders, affecting 5% to 50% of the entire population at all ages. Evidence suggests that inflammation and hyperosmolarity are considered core mechanisms in the development of dry eye. Dry eye is accompanied by changes in tear composition including enhanced hyperosmolarity and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and adhesion molecules. All these factors may act as mediators of tissue damage leading to lysis of cell membranes and  in epithelial cells. Eventually these processes lead to corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells death as well as conjunctival goblet cell dysfunction and death. Anti-inflammatory agents for dry eye include corticosteroids, immunomodulator agents and essential fatty . Recently, an integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) antagonist, lifitegrast ophthalmic solution (Xiidra) was approved in the USA for the treatment of dry eye.

This study was aimed to investigate the changes of intestinal microbiota and barrier function in burned mice to further comprehend the mechanisms of burn-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction.Samples were from mice inflicted with 30% total body surface area (TBSA) full-thickness burns. The intestinal permeability,  proteins expressions, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) localization, inflammatory cytokines expressions, and short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) contents were determined. The microbial community was assessed via 16S rDNA Illumina sequencing.The intestinal permeability was increased after severe burn injury, peaking at 6 h post-burn, with approximately 20-folds of the control ( < 0.001). The expression of  proteins (ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-2) was significantly altered ( < 0.05). The ZO-1 morphology was dramatically changed following burn injury. The fecal SCFAs' contents (acetate, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate) were noticeably declined after burn injury ( < 0.05). The expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6) in ileal mucosa were increased, whereas the expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) were decreased following burn injury ( < 0.05). In addition, burned mice showed an alteration of intestinal microbial community, such as decreased diversity, reduced  abundance, and increased  abundance.The severe burn-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction is along with the alterations of microbial community.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387268>Transepithelial Transport Characteristics of the Cholesterol- Lowing Soybean Peptide, WGAPSL, in Caco-2 Cell Monolayers.</a></h1><p>Recent studies have shown that soybean protein and its peptides have cholesterol-lowering activities. However, it is not clear whether these peptides could overcome physiological barriers, such as phase II metabolism in gastrointestinal tract and poor permeability, to reach the blood stream in its intact form. Therefore, the transepithelial transport characteristics of soybean peptide Trp-Gly-Ala-Pro-Ser-Leu (WGAPSL) with cholesterol- lowering activity were investigated in Caco-2 cells. In this study; the transepithelial absorption of WGAPSL was studied using human intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayers. The results showed that WGAPSL had good stability (83.9% ±1.98%) after simulated gastric and intestinal digestion. During the apical (AP) side to basolateral (BL) side transport, WGAPSL was absorbed intact through Caco-2 cell monolayers with apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) values of 4.4 × 10 to 1.2 × 10 cm/s. Cytochalasin D loosened the  of Caco-2 cell monolayers and significantly ( < 0.05) improved the transport process. Sodium azide, wortmannin, and Gly-Pro had minimal effects on transport, demonstrating that the major transport route of WGAPVL was paracellular via .

The current study thus investigated the pharmacological implications of a commonly used first-line angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, candesartan cilexetil, on the intestinal barrier impairment and gut dysbiosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). The results revealed that candesartan treatment protected against ileal and colonic pathologies and increased the intestinal expression of genes encoding  proteins such as cingulin, occludin and  protein 1 in SHRs. Serum level of lipopolysaccharides-binding protein was increased in candesartan-treated SHRs, supporting the notion that candesartan treatment provided protection against hypertension-associated impairment of intestinal barrier. Candesartan treatment also increased the amount of fecal short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) including acetic , propionic , and butyric  in SHRs. Fecal 16S rDNA sequencing further revealed that candesartan treatment normalized hypertension-altered ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes in SHRs. Most notably, candesartan treatment counteracted hypertension-associated diminishment of lactic -producing genus Lactobacillus. Taken together, the current study demonstrates for the first time that candesartan treatment alleviates hypertension-associated pathophysiological alterations in the gut, increases microbial production of SCFAs and preserves gut Lactobacillus under hypertensive conditions, which sheds novel light on the pharmacological implications of candesartan in the treatment of hypertension.Copyright © 2019.

The antiplatelet cilostazol (CS), a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor, exerted a beneficial effect on several models of gastrointestinal diseases; however, the full mechanism of action in this context has not been unveiled.The current study aimed to elucidate the potential role of CS in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis model.Male Wistar rats were divided into a sham group and groups treated with sulfasalazine (500 mg/kg), CS (50 and 100 mg/kg), and a combination (sulfasalazine/CS 50 mg/kg). All treatments were administered orally 15 days, with TNBS rectal administration on the 11th day.TNBS-produced colitis manifested as a decrease in the epithelial junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) and as an increase in trefoil factor-3, ulcerative area, and colon mass index, parameters that collaborate with the gross macroscopic changes in colon tissue. In addition, TNBS increased hemeoxygenase-1, nuclear factor-kappa B, P-selectin, and myeloperoxidase, as well as the apoptotic ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. Administration of CS alone, especially at the high dose level, attenuated the severity of TNBS-induced colitis in a sulfasalazine-comparable manner. In addition, a better effect was mediated by the combination regimen, which succeeded in normalizing most of the measured parameters.CS protected the colon against TNBS through its anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects along with maintaining cellular  (TJs). Furthermore, CS can be beneficial as an add-on drug with the conventional treatments of colitis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30999787>Probing paracellular - transcellular tissue barrier permeability using a gut mucosal explant culture system.</a></h1><p>Intestinal permeation enhancers (PEs), i.e. agents improving oral delivery of therapeutic drugs with poor bioavailability, may typically act by two principally different mechanisms: to increase either transcellular -or paracellular passage across the epithelium. With the aim to define these different modes of action in a small intestinal mucosal explant system, the transcellular-acting PE sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was compared to the paracellular-acting PE ethylenediaminetetraacetic  (EDTA), using several fluorescent polar - and lipophilic probes. Here, SDS rendered the enterocyte cell membranes leaky for the relatively small polar tracers Lucifer yellow and a 3 kD Texas red-conjugated dextran, but most conspicuously SDS blocked constitutive endocytosis from the brush border. In contrast, the main action of EDTA was to increase paracellular passage across the epithelium of both polar probes, including 10 - and 70 kDa dextrans and lipophilic probes, visualized by distinct stripy lateral staining of enterocytes and/or accumulation in the lamina propria. In addition, EDTA caused a loss of epithelial cell polarity by opening  for diffusion of domain-specific basolateral/apical cell membrane protein markers into the opposite domains. By transmission electron microscopy, SDS caused the formation of vacuoles and vesicle-like structures at the lateral cell membranes. In contrast, EDTA led to a bulging of the whole enterocyte apex, resulting in a "cobblestone" appearance of the epithelium, probably caused by an extreme contraction of the perijunctional actomyosin ring. We conclude that the mucosal explant system is a convenient model for predicting transcellular/paracellular modes of action of novel prospective PEs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195365>Navy bean supplemented high-fat diet improves intestinal health, epithelial barrier integrity and critical aspects of the obese inflammatory phenotype.</a></h1><p>Obesity is associated with impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function and an altered microbiota community structure, which contribute to host systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Fiber-rich common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) promote intestinal health (microbiota and host epithelial barrier integrity) in lean mice. The objective was to assess the intestinal health promoting effects of navy bean supplementation during high-fat (HF)diet-induced obesity. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a high-fat (HF) diet (60% of kcal from fat) or an isocaloric HF diet supplemented with 15.7% (by weight) cooked navy bean powder (HF+B) for 12 weeks. Compared to HF, the HF+B diet altered the fecal microbiota community structure (16S rRNA gene sequencing), most notably increasing abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila (+19-fold), whose abundance typically decreases in obese humans and rodents. Additionally, HF+B fecal abundance of carbohydrate fermenting, short chain fatty  (SCFA) producing Prevotella (+332-fold) and S24-7 (+1.6-fold) and fecal SCFA levels were increased. HF+B improved intestinal health and epithelial barrier integrity versus HF, evidenced by reduced serum fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran concentration in an in vivo gut permeability test, and increased intestinal mRNA expression of  components (ZO-1, occludin), anti-microbial defenses (Reg3γ, IgA, Defα5, Defβ2) and mucins (Muc2). Additionally, HF+B improved the systemic obese phenotype via reduced serum HOMA-IR and leptin:adiponectin ratio, and locally via attenuation of epididymal adipose tissue crown-like structure formation, adipocyte size, and inflammatory transcription factor (NFκBp65 and STAT3) activation. Therefore, navy bean supplementation improved obese intestinal health (microbiota and epithelial barrier integrity) and attenuated the severity of the obese phenotype.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The films were loaded with an epithelial cell growth factor cocktail and used as an extracellular matrix mimic (ECM mimic) for in vitro regeneration of organised respiratory epithelium using Calu-3 cell line and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Our data show differentiation of Calu-3 cells on composite films as evidenced by  protein expression and barrier formation. The films also supported attachment, migration and proliferation of alveolar basal epithelial cell line A549. We also show the suitability of the composite films as a biomimetic scaffold and growth factor delivery platform for differentiation of human MSCs to epithelial cells. MSCs differentiation to the epithelial lineage was confirmed by staining for epithelial and stem cell specific markers. Our data show that the MSCs acquire the epithelial characteristics after two weeks with significant reduction in vimentin, increase in pan cytokeratin expression as well as morphological changes. However, despite the expression of epithelial lineage markers these cells did not form fully functional  as evidenced by low expression of junctional protein ZO1. Further optimisation of culture conditions and growth factor cocktail is required to enhance  formation in MSCs derived epithelial cells on the composite hydrogels. Nevertheless, our data clearly highlight the possibility of using MSCs in epithelial tissue engineering and the applicability of the composite hydrogels as transferrable ECM mimics and delivery platforms with potential applications in regenerative medicine and in vitro modelling of barrier tissues.This article is protected by copyright.

However, the mechanism by which astrocytes control BBB integrity, especially after traumatic brain injury (TBI), remains unclear. Here, we present evidence that astrocyte-derived fatty -binding protein 7 (FABP7), a differentiation- and migration-associated molecule, may function as a modulator of BBB permeability in a rat weight-drop model of TBI. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that TBI induced increased expression of FABP7 in astrocytes, accompanied by caveolin-1 (Cav-1) upregulation in endothelial cells. Administration of recombinant FABP7 significantly ameliorated TBI-induced neurological deficits, brain edema, and BBB permeability, concomitant with upregulation of endothelial Cav-1 and  protein expression, while FABP7 knockdown resulted in the opposite effects. Furthermore, pretreatment with daidzein, a specific inhibitor of Cav-1, reversed the inhibitory effects of recombinant FABP7 on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9 expression and abolished its BBB protection after TBI. Altogether, these findings suggest that astrocyte-derived FABP7 upregulation may represent an endogenous protective response to BBB disruption partly mediated through a Cav-1/MMP signaling pathway following TBI.Copyright © 2019.

Understanding the exact molecular mechanisms by which their absorption behavior is regulated could greatly improve treatment strategies for stimulating intestinal absorption in diseases with Mg and/or Ca deficiency. However, such studies are hampered by the lack of in vitro intestinal cell models mimicking the mechanical and physiological properties of the gut. In this study we develop an in vitro gut model based on porous micropatterned membranes with villi-like surface topography and mechanical properties closely mimicking that of intestinal tissue. These membranes are prepared via phase separation micromolding using poly-ε-caprolactone/poly-lactic-glycolic  (PCL/PLGA) polymer blend and can facilitate cellular differentiation of Caco-2 cells similar to native enterocytes. In fact, cells cultured on these micropatterned membranes form a brush border of microvilli with spatial differences in morphology and  formation along the villous-base axis. Moreover, cells cultured on our membranes show a 2-fold increased alkaline phosphatase activity at the end of differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate that cells cultured on our micropatterned membranes have a 4- and 1.5-fold increased uptake of Mg and Ca, respectively, compared to non-patterned membranes. These results indicate that the new membranes can mimic the intestinal environment and therefore can have a great impact on mineral uptake in vitro.

These membranes are prepared via phase separation micromolding (PSμM), a technique which allows tailoring of the membrane surface topography combined with membrane porosity and interconnectivity which are important parameters for membranes used for in vitro transport studies. The culture of Caco-2 cells on these micropatterned membranes shows that they facilitate cellular differentiation similar to gut enterocytes. Our data indicate that mimicking the 3D geometry of the gut is very important for improving the physiological relevance of in vitro gut models. In the future, our micropatterned membranes with segment-specific geometries, in combination with isotopic measurements, would be applied to perform detailed ion uptake and transport studies.Copyright © 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

Cancer cells overcome the constraints of  (TJ) to invade other tissues, but less is known about the regulating role of  on bladder cancer (BC) invasion. In order to identify the invasion-regulating function of  component, we investigated the oncogenetic features of zonula occludens-1 associated nucleic  binding protein (ZONAB), a TJ protein that is usually highly expressed in solid cancers. Expression of ZONAB was found to be up-regulated in human BC cell lines detected by real-time PCR, Western blotting. ZONAB expression was significantly up-regulated in BC cell lines and negatively regulated E-cadherin expression. Overexpression of ZONAB by stable transduction in human BC cell lines promoted invasion detected by transwell invasion assay. Conversely, stable suppression of ZONAB expression by RNA interference (RNAi) in BC cells attenuated invasion. A similar role for ZONAB in promoting invasion and EMT was observed in xenografts. In summary, ZONAB is up-regulated in BC cell lines, which promotes invasion, demonstrating the important role it plays in tumorogenesis and cancer progression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31209725>Genome-wide identification of Chinese shrimp (Fenneropenaeus chinensis) microRNA responsive to low pH stress by deep sequencing.</a></h1><p>pH has a great impact on the distribution, growth, behavior, and physiology in many aquatic animals. Here, we analyzed miRNA expression profiles of Chinese shrimp (Fenneropenaeus chinensis) from control pH (8.2) and low pH (6.5)-treated shrimp. Expression analysis identified 6 known miRNAs and 23 novel miRNAs with significantly different expression between control pH 8.2 and low pH 6.5; the predicted target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were significantly enriched in organic  metabolic process, oxidoreductase activity, coenzyme binding, cofactor binding, and collagen trimer. Moreover, target genes were significantly enriched in several Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways including citrate cycle, pyruvate metabolism, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, , carbon metabolism, etc. Our survey expanded the number of known shrimp miRNAs and provided comprehensive information about miRNA response to low pH stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211803>Antibiotics induced intestinal  barrier dysfunction is associated with microbiota dysbiosis, activated NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy.</a></h1><p> barrier is critical to intestinal homeostasis. Applying antibiotics to treat infections is common in clinical practice, which may affect intestinal microbiota. Intestinal microbiota dysbiosis is involved in the occurrence of some gastrointestinal diseases. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the influence of antibiotics on intestinal  barrier and the possible underlying mechanisms. Healthy adult female C57BL/6 mice were treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail for 14 days. 16S rDNA Illumina sequencing and headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-GC/MS) were respectively used to analyze microbial community and to detect short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) contents. In vivo intestinal paracellular permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-dextran) was measured. Protein expression was determined by immunoblotting. Immunofluoresence was applied to observe the distributions of ZO-1, LC3B and ASC. Antibiotics remarkably altered intestinal microbiota composition in healthy mice, accompanying reduced SCFAs' concentrations. In addition, the intestinal  barrier was disrupted by antibiotic treatment, as evidenced by increased intestinal paracellular permeability to FITC-dextran, decreased  protein expressions, and disrupted ZO-1 morphology. Furthermore, NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy were activated by antibiotic treatment. In conclusion, intestinal epithelial  barrier dysfunction induced by antibiotics is associated with intestinal microbiota dysbiosis, activated NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy in mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379610>Pinocembrin Protects Against Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Rats Colitis by Ameliorating Inflammation, Improving Barrier Function and Modulating Gut Microbiota.</a></h1><p>Pinocembrin (PIN) is a natural flavonoid widely found in bee propolis with potent gastrointestinal protective effects. In consequence, PIN has great potential in preventing inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) while scant information is available. In this study, a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced rats ulcerative colitis model (3.5% DSS in drinking water for 7 days) was applied to explore the protective effects of PIN on macroscopic colitis symptoms, inflammation, intestinal epithelial barrier function, and gut microbiota homeostasis. While DSS-treated rats showed severe colitis clinical symptoms and histological changes (colonic pathological damages and intestinal goblet cells loss), pre-administration of PIN (5 and 10 mg/kg, ) for a week alleviated these symptoms. Pre-administration of PIN also suppressed the pro-inflammatory gene expressions and improved  functions of colonic epithelial cells. Additionally, PIN administration reversed DSS-induced short chain fatty  loss, and improved the gut microbial diversity assessed by 16S rRNA phylogenetic sequencing. Overall, our results suggest a wide spectrum of protective effects of PIN in preventing IBDs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30891680>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens Ameliorates HO-Induced Oxidative Damage by Regulating Transporters, , and Apoptosis Gene Expression in Cell Line IPEC-1.</a></h1><p>Probiotics have always been considered as a supplementary therapy for many diseases especially gut disorders. The absorption and barrier function of the gut play a vital role in the maintenance of body homeostasis. This study was to investigate the protective effects of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SC06 (Ba) on HO-induced oxidative stress on intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-1) based on the level of gene expression. We demonstrated that Ba was a safe probiotic strain in the first place. Results showed that treatment with HO significantly increased the mRNA expression of absorptive transporters glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), Ala/Ser/Cys/Thr transporter 1 (ASCT1), and ASCT2 compared with the control group. Meanwhile, oxidative stress induced a significant improvement in the mRNA expression of occludin (OCLN) and caspase-3, and remarkably inhibited the expression of L-type amino  transporter 1 (LAT1) or B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), respectively. Pretreatment with Ba dramatically reversed the disturbance induced by oxidative stress on the mRNA expression of ASCT1, ASCT2, and OCLN, which also significantly prevented HO-inhibited LAT1 and Bcl-2 mRNA expression. However, Ba failed to exert any significant protective effect on GLUT2 and caspase-3 mRNA expression. We concluded that pretreatment with Ba could alleviate the damage caused by oxidative stress to a certain extent and conferred a protective effect to the intestine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926360>The marine biotoxin okadaic  affects intestinal  proteins in human intestinal cells.</a></h1><p>Okadaic  (OA) is a lipophilic phycotoxin that accumulates in the hepatopancreas and fatty tissue of shellfish. Consumption of highly OA-contaminated seafood leads to diarrhetic shellfish poisoning which provokes severe gastrointestinal symptoms associated with a disruption of the intestinal epithelium. Since the molecular mechanisms leading to intestinal barrier disruption are not fully elucidated, we investigated the influence of OA on intestinal  proteins (TJPs) in differentiated Caco-2 cells. We found a concentration- and time-dependent deregulation of genes encoding for intestinal TJPs of the claudin family, occludin, as well as zonula occludens (ZO) 1 and 2. Immunofluorescence staining showed concentration-dependent effects on the structural organization of TJPs already after treatment with a subtoxic but human-relevant concentration of OA. In addition, changes in the structural organization of cytoskeletal F-actin as well as its associated protein ZO-1 were observed. In summary, we demonstrated effects of OA on TJPs in intestinal Caco-2 cells. TJP expressions were affected after treatment with food-relevant OA concentrations. These results might explain the high potential of OA to disrupt the intestinal barrier in vivo as its first target. Thereby the present data contribute to a better understanding of the OA-dependent induction of molecular effects within the intestinal epithelium.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Mechanisms leading to the endothelial contribution on the early exudative stage of ARDS are not precise. We hypothesized that modulation of endothelial stromelysin1 expression and activity by Akt1-forkhead box-O transcription factors 1/3a (FoxO1/3a) pathway could play a significant role in regulating pulmonary edema during the initial stages of acute lung injury (ALI). We utilized lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse ALI model in vivo and endothelial barrier resistance measurements in vitro to determine the specific role of the endothelial Akt1-FoxO1/3a-stromelysin1 pathway in ALI. LPS treatment of human pulmonary endothelial cells resulted in increased stromelysin1 and reduced  claudin5 involving FoxO1/3a, associated with decreased trans-endothelial barrier resistance as determined by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing technology. In vivo, LPS-induced lung edema was significantly higher in endothelial Akt1 knockdown (EC-Akt1) compared to wild-type mice, which was reversed upon treatment with FoxO inhibitor (AS1842856), stromelysin1 inhibitor (UK356618) or with shRNA-mediated FoxO1/3a depletion in the mouse lungs. Overall, our study provides the hope that targeting FoxO and styromelysin1 could be beneficial in the treatment of ALI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These include Na/H exchanger (NHE), V-type H-ATPase (V-ATPase), cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase, HCO  transporters and Rhesus proteins. Consequently, renal  output in the form of protons and NH  increases. However, little is known about the mechanistic details of renal -base regulation in  and teleost fishes in general. The present study applied the scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET) to measure proton flux in proximal, distal and connecting tubules of goldfish. We detected increased H efflux into the extracellular fluid from the tubule in fed animals, resulting from paracellular back-flux of H through the . By applying inhibitors for selected -base regulatory epithelial transporters, we found that cytosolic carbonic anhydrase and HCO  transporters were important in mediating H flux in all three tubule segments of fed goldfish. Contrastingly, V-ATPase seemed to play a role in H flux only in proximal and distal tubules, and NHE in proximal and connecting tubules. We developed working models for transport of -base relevant equivalents (H, HCO , NH/NH ) for each tubule segment in  kidney. While the proximal tubule appears to play a major role in both H secretion and HCO  reabsorption, the distal and connecting tubules seem to mainly serve for HCO  reabsorption and NH/NH  secretion.© 2019.

Pregnant mice were randomly divided into three groups. The Control group was provided a diet containing Met and received i.p. injection of saline. The Met group was fed the same diet but without Met and received daily i.p. injection of 35% of the Met contained in the control diet. The Met-Met group was treated the same as the Met group, except that 25% of the Met injected was replaced with Met-Met. Met-Met promoted villus surface area in ileum compared with Met alone. In addition, the mRNA abundance of amino  and glucose transporters in the small intestine was altered with Met-Met. Moreover, Met-Met increased  protein and decreased apoptosis-related proteins expression in the jejunum and ileum. These results suggest that Met-Met can promote intestinal function over Met alone in Met-deficient mice.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614141>Trans-10-hydroxy-2-decenoic  alleviates LPS-induced blood-brain barrier dysfunction by activating the AMPK/PI3K/AKT pathway.</a></h1><p>We previously reported that trans-10-hydroxy-2-decenoic  (10-HDA), the exclusive lipid component of royal jelly (RJ), alleviates Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation both in vivo and in vitro. However, whether 10-HDA can protect against LPS-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage is largely unexplored. In this study, we first observed that 10-HDA decreased BBB permeability in LPS-stimulated C57BL/6 mice by Evan's blue (EB) dye. Immunostaining and Western blot results showed that 10-HDA alleviated BBB dysfunction by inhibiting the degradation of  proteins (occludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1). In LPS-stimulated human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), 10-HDA decreased the expression of chemokines (CCL-2 and CCL-3), adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1), reactive oxygen species, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and increased the expression of  proteins. Interestingly, LC-MS/MS analysis showed that 10-HDA pretreatment upregulated the expression of mitochondria-associated proteins, which may reflect the mechanism underlying the regulatory effect of 10-HDA on reactive oxygen species. We further illustrated that 10-HDA promoted the activation of the AMPK pathway and the downstream PI3K/AKT pathway. Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) and LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) markedly reversed the alleviating effect of 10-HDA on the expression of  proteins, indicating that 10-HDA inhibited LPS-induced BBB dysfunction by triggering the activation of the AMPK/PI3K/AKT pathway. Collectively, these data reveal that 10-HDA may be an interesting candidate for clinical evaluation in the treatment of diseases related to BBB damage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Fish oil (FO)-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  have been shown to improve aspects of the obese phenotype; however, their effect on obese intestinal health is unknown. This study aimed to determine the effect of dietary FO on the intestinal microenvironment, including the microbial community and epithelial barrier, in a mouse model of high-fat diet induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed (12 weeks) either a high-fat diet (HF, 60% fat as kcal) or an isocaloric HF supplemented with Menhaden FO (5.3% kcal, HF + FO). 16S rRNA sequencing was used to determine changes in fecal microbiota. Intestinal (ileum and colon) and epididymal adipose tissue RNA was used to assess biomarkers of barrier integrity and inflammatory status, respectively. Serum was used to assess adipokine concentrations and insulin resistance. HF + FO diet altered the fecal microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Firmicutes and increasing the abundance of members of the Bacteroidetes phyla, as well as increasing the abundance of antiobesogenic Akkermansia muciniphila, compared to HF. Intestinal epithelial barrier functions were improved by HF + FO evidenced by increased mRNA expression of  components, antimicrobial defenses and mucus barrier components. HF + FO-fed mice exhibited improvements in homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, oral glucose tolerance and serum adipokine concentrations and epididymal mRNA expression (increased adiponectin and decreased leptin) versus HF.

In this role, the intestinal tract is responsible not only for absorbing essential dietary nutrients, but also for protecting the host from a variety of ingested toxins and microbes. The intestinal barrier system is composed of a mucus layer, intestinal epithelial cells (IECs),  (TJs), immune cells, and a gut microbiota, which are all susceptible to external factors such as dietary fats. When components of this barrier system are disrupted, intestinal permeability to luminal contents increases, which is implicated in intestinal pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, and celiac disease. Currently, there is mounting evidence that consumption of excess dietary fats can enhance intestinal permeability differentially. For example, dietary fat modulates the expression and distribution of TJs, stimulates a shift to barrier-disrupting hydrophobic bile , and even induces IEC oxidative stress and apoptosis. In addition, a high-fat diet (HFD) enhances intestinal permeability directly by stimulating proinflammatory signaling cascades and indirectly via increasing barrier-disrupting cytokines [TNFα, interleukin (IL) 1B, IL6, and interferon γ (IFNγ)] and decreasing barrier-forming cytokines (IL10, IL17, and IL22). Finally, an HFD negatively modulates the intestinal mucus composition and enriches the gut microflora with barrier-disrupting species. Although further research is necessary to understand the precise role HFDs play in intestinal permeability, current data suggest a stronger link between diet and intestinal disease than was first thought to exist. Therefore, this review seeks to highlight the various ways an HFD disrupts the gut barrier system and its many implications in human health.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652176>Effect of caseinate glycation with oligochitosan and transglutaminase on the intestinal barrier function of the tryptic caseinate digest in IEC-6 cells.</a></h1><p>Oligochitosan was used in this study to glycate commercial caseinate under the catalytic action of transglutaminase (TGase), followed by trypsin-mediated digestion. The prepared tryptic digests from both caseinate and oligochitosan-glycated caseinate were assessed and compared for their effects on the intestinal barrier function of a cell model (IEC-6 cells). Both digests had similar chemical features in the nine amino  (except for Met) and free amino group contents, but had different glucosamine contents. Both digests at 12.5-100 μg mL-1 promoted IEC-6 cell growth by 105.6-135.1% and more importantly improved intestinal epithelial barrier integrity via increasing trans-epithelial electrical resistance, decreasing paracellular permeability from 100% to 64.1-85.4%, reducing bacterial translocation, and enhancing antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. The obtained qPCR and western-blot assay results also demonstrated that both digests had promoting effects on the expression levels of several  proteins such as ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1. The oligochitosan-glycated caseinate digest always showed higher effects than the caseinate digest in the cells to retain the intestinal epithelial barrier function. This study thus highlights that the used TGase-type glycation endowed the oligochitosan-glycated caseinate with a potential functional food ingredient to strengthen the epithelial barrier function, which might be a helpful event to intestinal health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605748>Effects of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic  on an isogeneic model of the human blood-brain barrier.</a></h1><p>Glyphosate is a pesticide used for occupational and non-occupational purposes. Because glyphosate targets a metabolic pathway absent in animals, it is considered safe for humans. Yet, case reports of accidental exposure to concentrated solutions following self-inflicted poisoning documented neurological lesions suggesting a neurotoxicity. In this study, we investigated the effect of acute exposure to glyphosate (GPH) on the blood-brain barrier in vitro based on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and compared to two chemical analogs: aminomethylphosphonic  (AMPA) and glycine (GLY), for concentrations ranging from 0.1 μM to 1000 μM. GPH treatment (1 and 10 μM) for 24 h showed an increase BBB permeability to fluorescein, with similar outcomes for AMPA. In addition to its ability to disrupt the barrier function, GPH show evidence of permeability across the BBB. Although no detrimental effects were observed on neuron differentiation at high doses, we noted changes in neuronal cell metabolic activity and glucose uptake in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) following treatment with 100 μM GPH or AMPA. Taken together, our data indicates that accidental exposure to high level of GPH may result in neurological damage via an opening of the blood-brain barrier and an alteration of glucose metabolism.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) is widely known to have various biological effects, and in this study we aimed to evaluate the liver-protective effect in diet-induced obese mice for an enzymatically digested product of COS called COS23 which is mainly composed of dimers and trimers. An integrated analysis of the lipidome and gut microbiome were performed to assess the effects of COS23 on lipids in plasma and the liver as well as on intestinal microbiota. Our results revealed that COS23 obviously attenuated hepatic steatosis and ameliorated liver injury in diet-induced obese mice. The hepatic toxic lipids-especially triglycerides (TGs) and free fatty  (FFAs)-were decreased dramatically after COS23 treatment. COS23 regulated lipid-related pathways, especially inhibiting the expressions of FFA-synthesis-related genes and inflammation-related genes. Furthermore, COS23 could alter lipid profiles in plasma. More importantly, COS23 also decreased the abundance of  and increased the abundance of  in gut microbiota and protected the intestinal barrier by up-regulating the expression of -related genes.

This compartimentalization is required for appropriate lung function, it is established during perinatal periods and can be disturbed in lung edema. Herein we elaborated the impact of the air-liquid interface (ALI) on the function of the pulmonary epithelium. We used NCI-H441 epithelia as a well-established and characterized model of distal airway epithelia, which were cultivated either at ALI or (at submerged conditions) at liquid-liquid interface conditions (LLI). Our study revealed that paracellular permeability was increased and claudin 1 (CLDN1) expression levels were reduced under LLI conditions. This was accompanied by elevated c-FOS, c-JUN and retinoic  receptor α (RARA) expression, as well as cellular retinoic  (RA) content. Exposure of epithelia to RA derivatives of ALI cultivated epithelia mimicked effects of LLI. The increase in RA content was in line with the identified upregulation of retinoic  anabolizing enzymes ALDH1A3 and DHRS3. CLDN1 promoter analysis revealed c-FOS and c-JUN as activating transcription factors, whereas activation of RARA reduced CLDN1 promoter activity. We then concluded that ALI/LLI dependent modulation of CLDN1 expression and TJ permeability is under the control of RA synthesis. Activation of RARA results in an inhibition of c-FOS/c-JUN dependent CLDN1 promoter activation and increased TJ permeability. Our results underscore RA signalling as a pivotal mechanism in adjusting TJ properties, which could play a role during birth when the lung changes from LLI to ALI conditions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The three-dimensional structure of human CLDN4 was constructed based on homology modeling approach. A total of 265 242 molecules from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) database has been utilized as a dataset for this study. In the present work, structure-based virtual screening is performed with the NCI database using Glide. By molecular docking, 10 candidate molecules with high scoring functions, which binds to the active site of CLDN4 were identified. Subsequently, molecular dynamics simulations of membrane protein were used for optimization of the top-three lead compounds (NCI110039, NCI344682, and NCI661251) with CLDN4 in a dynamic system.

Weaning impairs the intestinal integrity, disturbs digestive and absorptive capacity, and increases the intestinal oxidative stress, and susceptibility of diseases in piglets. The improvement of intestinal development and health is critically important for enhancing nutrient digestibility capacity and disease resistance of weaned pigs, therefore, increasing their survival rate at this most vulnerable stage, and overall productive performance during later stages. A healthy gut may include but not limited several important features: a healthy proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells, an integrated gut barrier function, a preferable or balanced gut microbiota, and a well-developed intestinal mucosa immunity. Burgeoning evidence suggested nutritional intervention are one of promising measures to enhance intestinal health of weaned pigs, although the exact protective mechanisms may vary and are still not completely understood. Previous research indicated that functional amino , such as arginine, cysteine, glutamine, or glutamate, may enhance intestinal mucosa immunity (i.e., increased sIgA secretion), reduce oxidative damage, stimulate proliferation of enterocytes, and enhance gut barrier function (i.e., enhanced expression of  protein) of weaned pigs. A number of feed additives are marketed to assist in boosting intestinal immunity and regulating gut microbiota, therefore, reducing the negative impacts of weaning, and other environmental challenges on piglets. The promising results have been demonstrated in antimicrobial peptides, clays, direct-fed microbials, micro-minerals, milk components, oligosaccharides, organic , phytochemicals, and many other feed additives. This review summarizes our current understanding of nutritional intervention on intestinal health and development of weaned pigs and the importance of mechanistic studies focusing on this research area.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076401>Leaky gut: mechanisms, measurement and clinical implications in humans.</a></h1><p>The objectives of this review on 'leaky gut' for clinicians are to discuss the components of the intestinal barrier, the diverse measurements of intestinal permeability, their perturbation in non-inflammatory 'stressed states' and the impact of treatment with dietary factors. Information on 'healthy' or 'leaky' gut in the public domain requires confirmation before endorsing dietary exclusions, replacement with non-irritating foods (such as fermented foods) or use of supplements to repair the damage. The intestinal barrier includes surface mucus, epithelial layer and immune defences. Epithelial permeability results from increased paracellular transport, apoptosis or transcellular permeability. Barrier function can be tested in vivo using orally administered probe molecules or in vitro using mucosal biopsies from humans, exposing the colonic mucosa from rats or mice or cell layers to extracts of colonic mucosa or stool from human patients. Assessment of intestinal barrier requires measurements beyond the epithelial layer. 'Stress' disorders such as endurance exercise, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs administration, pregnancy and surfactants (such as bile  and dietary factors such as emulsifiers) increase permeability. Dietary factors can reverse intestinal leakiness and mucosal damage in the 'stress' disorders. Whereas inflammatory or ulcerating intestinal diseases result in leaky gut, no such disease can be cured by simply normalising intestinal barrier function. It is still unproven that restoring barrier function can ameliorate clinical manifestations in GI or systemic diseases. Clinicians should be aware of the potential of barrier dysfunction in GI diseases and of the barrier as a target for future therapy.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

It is well known that  mycotoxins will lead a breakdown of the normally impeccable epithelial barrier, resulting in the development of a "leaky" gut. H administration with different methods has been proved definitely potentials to prevent serious intestinal diseases. The goal of this study is to investigate the roles of lactulose (LAC) and hydrogen-rich water (HRW) in preventing intestinal dysfunction in piglets fed  mycotoxin-contaminated feed.A total of 24 female piglets were evenly assigned to 4 groups: negative control (NC) group, mycotoxin-contaminated (MC) feed group, MC feed with LAC treatment (MC + LAC), and MC feed with HRW treatment (MC + HRW), respectively. Piglets in the NC group were fed uncontaminated control diet, while remaining piglets were fed  mycotoxin-contaminated diet. For the NC and MC groups, 10 mL/kg body weight (BW) of hydrogen-free water (HFW) was orally administrated to piglets twice daily; while in the MC + LAC and MC + HRW groups, piglets were treated with the same dose of LAC solution (500 mg/kg BW) and HRW twice daily, respectively. On d 25, serum was collected and used for biochemical analysis. Intestinal tissues were sampled for morphological examination as well as relative genes and protein expression analysis.Our data showed that  mycotoxins induced higher serum diamine oxidase (DAO) activities ( 0.05), -lactic  levels ( 0.01), and endotoxin status ( 0.01), lower villus height ( 0.01) and ratio of villus height to crypt depth ( 0.05) in small intestine, greater apoptosis index and higher mRNA expression related to  ( 0.05). In addition, the distribution and down-regulation of claudin-3 (CLDN3) protein in the small intestinal was also observed. As expected, oral administrations of HRW and LAC were found to remarkably provide beneficial effects against  mycotoxin-induced apoptosis and intestinal leaking. Moreover, either HRW or LAC treatments were also revealed to prevent abnormal intestinal morphological changes, disintegrate , and restore the expression and distribution of CLDN3 protein in the small intestinal mucosal layer in female piglets that were fed  mycotoxins contaminated diet.Our data suggest that orally administrations of HRW and LAC result in less  mycotoxin-induced apoptosis and leak in the small intestine.

The current study aimed to investigate the efficacy of supplementing a novel specific low-methoxyl pectin (LMP) dietary fiber in preventing T1D development. Female NOD mice were weaned onto control or 5% (wt/wt) LMP supplemented diets for up to 40 weeks of age, overt diabetes incidence and blood glucose were monitored. Then broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABX) treatment per os for 7 days followed by gut microbiota transfer was performed to demonstrate gut microbiota-dependent effects. Next-generation sequencing was used for analyzing the composition of microbiota in caecum. Concentration of short chain fatty  were determined by GC-MS. The barrier reinforcing  proteins zonula occludens-2 (ZO-2), claudin-1 and NOD like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation were determined by Western blot. The proportion of CD25Foxp3CD4 regulatory T cell (Foxp3 Treg) in the pancreas, pancreatic and mesenteric lymph nodes was analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that LMP supplementation ameliorated T1D development in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, as evidenced by decreasing diabetes incidence and fasting glucose levels in LMP fed NOD mice. Further microbiota analysis revealed that LMP supplementation prevented T1D-associated caecal dysbiosis and selectively enriched caecal bacterial species to produce more SCFAs. The LMP-mediated microbial balance further enhanced caecal barrier function and shaped gut-pancreatic immune environment, as characterized by higher expression of  proteins claudin-1, ZO-2 in caecum, increased Foxp3 Treg population and decreased NLRP3 inflammasome activation in both caecum and pancreas. The microbiota-dependent beneficial effect of LMP on T1D was further proven by the fact that aberration of caecal microbiota by ABX treatment worsened T1D autoimmunity and could be restored with transfer of feces of LMP-fed NOD mice. These data demonstrate that this novel LMP limits T1D development by inducing caecal homeostasis to shape pancreatic immune environment. This finding opens a realistic option for gut microbiota manipulation and prevention of T1D in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30977499>Dietary l-tryptophan alleviated LPS-induced intestinal barrier injury by regulating  in a Caco-2 cell monolayer model.</a></h1><p>The intestinal epithelial layer forms a barrier through cell-cell  and breaking or even slightly disrupting this barrier can lead to serious pathological consequences, including infection and inflammation. Various amino  have been shown to improve the intestinal tract, but the effect of tryptophan on the intestinal barrier has been controversial. Here, an in vitro Caco-2 cell model was built to investigate the protective and reparative effects of different concentrations of dietary l-Tryptophan (l-Trp) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intestinal  injury. Lower concentrations (40 μM) of dietary l-Trp protected and repaired the integrity and permeability injury of the intestinal  induced by LPS, while high concentrations (80 μM) may not have a positive effect. LPS-induced injury led to increased (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of Nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) and Myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), and decreased (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Mitogen-activated protein (MAP), and the treatment of dietary l-Trp alleviated those regulations in different concentrations, which suggests that dietary l-Trp may attenuate LPS-induced injury to  via inhibiting the NFκB-MLCK signaling pathway and activating the ERK1/2-MAP signaling pathway. And the mRNA and protein expressions of claudin-1, occludin and ZO-1 in LPS-induced injury were all down-regulated to varying degrees, and dietary l-Trp weakened the down-regulation of claudin-1 (P < 0.05) with no significant regulation of the protein expression of occludin and ZO-1 (P > 0.05).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30971956>Impact of Sensitization and Inflammation on the Interaction of Mast Cells With the Intestinal Epithelium in Rats.</a></h1><p>The density of intestinal mast cells has been reported to increase during inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). As mast cell mediators are known to increase the permeability of epithelial , we hypothesized that antigen responses in sensitized animals might be enhanced under inflammatory conditions. This would contribute to a vicious circle by further enhancing the entry of luminal antigens into the colonic wall and thereby continuing the inadequate immune response during IBD. Therefore, one group of rats was sensitized against ovalbumin. In a second group of animals additionally a colitis was induced by rectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS) dissolved in ethanol. Specimens from distal colon and jejunum (as intestinal segment located distantly from the inflamed area) were mounted in Ussing chambers to measure tissue conductance, short-circuit current (I) induced by antigen exposure and paracellular permeability (fluorescein flux). This was paralleled by determination of mast cell markers and  proteins with immunofluorescence and qPCR. In contrast to the initial hypothesis, antigen-induced I was not upregulated, but tended to be downregulated in the tissues from the colitis animals, both in colon and in jejunum. Only in the jejunum mast cell degranulation evoked an increase in fluorescein flux. Mast cell density was not altered significantly in the colon of the colitis animals. In the jejunum, sensitization induced a strong increase in mast cell density, which was unaffected by additional induction of colitis. Expression of sealing  components claudin-3 and -4 were increased on the protein level in the sensitized animals in comparison to non-sensitized animals. Additional induction of colitis evoked a downregulation of claudin-3 in both intestinal segments and an upregulation of claudin-4 in the jejunum. Consequently, these data indicate segment differences in mast cell - epithelium interaction, but no enhancement of ion secretion in the TNBS/ethanol model of acute colitis after prior sensitization.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30577574>Dietary l-Tryptophan Supplementation Enhances the Intestinal Mucosal Barrier Function in Weaned Piglets: Implication of Tryptophan-Metabolizing Microbiota.</a></h1><p>l-Tryptophan (Trp) is known to play an important role in the health of the large intestine. However, a role of dietary Trp in the small-intestinal mucosal barrier and microbiota remains poorly understood. The present study was conducted with weaned piglets to address this issue. Postweaning piglets were fed for 4 weeks a corn- and soybean meal-based diet supplemented with 0 (Control), 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4% Trp. The small-intestinal microbiota and serum amino  were analyzed by bacterial 16S rRNA gene-based high-throughput sequencing methods and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively. The mRNA levels for genes involved in host defense and the abundances of  proteins in jejunum and duodenum were measured by real time-PCR and Western blot techniques, respectively. The concentrations of Trp in the serum of Trp-supplemented piglets increased in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with the control group, dietary supplementation with 0.2⁻0.4% Trp reduced the abundances of  and  in the jejunum, increased the abundances of  and  (two species of bacteria that can metabolize Trp) in the jejunum, and augmented the concentrations of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) as well as mRNA levels for porcine β-defensins 2 and 3 in jejunal tissues. Moreover, dietary Trp supplementation activated the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and increased the abundances of  proteins (zonula occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-3, and claudin-1) in jejunum and duodenum. We suggested that Trp-metabolizing bacteria in the small intestine of weaned pigs primarily mediated the beneficial effects of dietary Trp on its mucosal integrity, health, and function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31360146>Screening differentially expressed proteins from co-cultured hematopoietic cells and bone marrow-derived stromal cells by quantitative proteomics (SILAC) method.</a></h1><p>Bone marrow stromal cells protect hematopoietic cells and provide drug resistance by delivering bunch of variable proteins. Thus, alterations of protein expression are typically associated with cell-cell signal transduction and regulation of cellular functions.Co-culture models of bone marrow stromal cells and hematopoietic cells are often used in studies of their crosstalk. Studies of altered protein expression initiated by stromal cell/hematopoietic cell interactions are an important new trend in microenvironmental research. There has been no report to date of global quantitative proteomics analysis of crosstalk between hematopoietic cells and stromal cells. In this study, we analyzed quantitative proteomes in a co-culture system of stromal HS5 cells and hematopoietic KG1a cells, and simultaneously tracked differentially expressed proteins in two types of cells before and after co-culture by stable isotope labeling by amino  in cell culture (SILAC) method.We have shown that in co-cultured KG1a, 40 proteins (including CKAP4, LMNA, and SERPINB2) were upregulated and 64 proteins (including CD44, CD99, and NCAM1) were downregulated relative to KG1a alone. We utilized IPA analysis to discover that the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway was upregulated, whereas platelet activation was downregulated in co-cultured KG1a cells. Furthermore, 95 proteins (including LCP1, ARHGAP4, and UNCX) were upregulated and 209 proteins (including CAPG, FLNC, and MAP4) were downregulated in co-cultured HS5 relative to HS5 alone. The  pathway was downregulated and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway was dysfunctional in co-cultured HS5. Most importantly, the significantly differentially expressed proteins can also be confirmed using different co-cultured cell lines.Altogether, we recommend such quantitative proteomics approach for the studies of the hematopoietic-stroma cross-talk, differentially expressed proteins and related signaling pathways identification. The differentially expressed proteins identified from this current SILAC method will provide a useful basis for ongoing studies of crosstalk between stromal cells and hematopoietic cells in co-culture systems. All these result suggested our ongoing studies can focus on the mechanisms underlying CKAP4 increase and CD44 decrease in co-cultured hematopoietic cells, and the increase of LCP1 and decrease of CAPG in co-cultured stromal cell. The proteomic profiles from the KG1a/stromal cell co-culture system give new molecular insights into the roles of these cells in MDS pathophysiology and related bone disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30861990>Strategies to Enhance Drug Absorption via Nasal and Pulmonary Routes.</a></h1><p>New therapeutic agents such as proteins, peptides, and nucleic -based agents are being developed every year, making it vital to find a non-invasive route such as nasal or pulmonary for their administration. However, a major concern for some of these newly developed therapeutic agents is their poor absorption. Therefore, absorption enhancers have been investigated to address this major administration problem. This paper describes the basic concepts of transmucosal administration of drugs, and in particular the use of the pulmonary or nasal routes for administration of drugs with poor absorption. Strategies for the exploitation of absorption enhancers for the improvement of pulmonary or nasal administration are discussed, including use of surfactants, cyclodextrins, protease inhibitors, and  modulators, as well as application of carriers such as liposomes and nanoparticles.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30897784>Beneficial Effects of  Bunge Water Extract on Inflammatory Cytokines Release and Gut Microbiota in High-Fat Diet and Streptozotocin-Induced Type 2 Diabetic Mice.</a></h1><p> Bunge (PDB), a perennial herb, has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine in the therapy of many diseases. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of PDB water extract on systemic inflammation and gut microbiota in type 2 diabetic (T2D) mice induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ) injection. C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into a normal diet (ND) group, T2D group, and PDB group (diabetic mice treated with PDB water extract at a dose of 400 mg/kg body weight). Results showed that PDB significantly decreased the levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum. Further investigation showed that PDB significantly reduced the ratio of / and the relative abundance of  in fecal samples of diabetic mice. In addition, PDB notably alleviated intestinal inflammation as evidenced by decreased expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and inflammatory cytokines. PDB also reversed the decreased expression of intestinal mucosal  proteins including Claudin3, ZO-1, and Occludin. Meanwhile, the levels of fecal acetic  and butyric  and their specific receptors including G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 41 and 43 expression in the colon were also increased after PDB treatment.

After brain damage by traumatic brain injury, cerebral ischemia and several other CNS disorders, the functions of the BBB are disrupted, resulting in severe secondary damage including brain edema and inflammatory injury. Therefore, BBB protection and recovery are considered novel therapeutic strategies for reducing brain damage. Emerging evidence suggests key roles of astrocyte-derived factors in BBB disruption and recovery after brain damage. The astrocyte-derived vascular permeability factors include vascular endothelial growth factors, matrix metalloproteinases, nitric oxide, glutamate and endothelin-1, which enhance BBB permeability leading to BBB disruption. By contrast, the astrocyte-derived protective factors include angiopoietin-1, sonic hedgehog, glial-derived neurotrophic factor, retinoic  and insulin-like growth factor-1 and apolipoprotein E which attenuate BBB permeability resulting in recovery of BBB function. In this review, the roles of these astrocyte-derived factors in BBB function are summarized, and their significance as therapeutic targets for BBB protection and recovery after brain damage are discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618733>Geniposide and Chlorogenic  Combination Ameliorates Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis Involving the Protection on the Gut Barrier Function in Mouse Induced by High-Fat Diet.</a></h1><p>Gut-liver axis is increasingly recognized to be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The gut microbiota and intestinal permeability have been demonstrated to be the key players in the gut-liver cross talk in NAFLD. Geniposide and chlorogenic  (GC) combination is derived from a traditional Chinese medicine, Qushi Huayu Decoction (QHD), which has been used in clinic for NAFLD treatment for decades in China and validated in multiple animal models of NAFLD. GC combination previously has been demonstrated to treat NAFLD via modulation on the gut microbiota composition. In the present study, the effects of GC combination on gut barrier function in NAFLD were evaluated, and QHD and sodium butyrate (NaB), the intestinal mucosa protectant, were used as positive control. The therapeutic effect of GC combination on NAFLD were confirmed by amelioration on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced by high-fat diet (HFD) in mouse, which was comparable to that of QHD. Simultaneously, GC combination was found to reduce the signaling of gut-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) including hepatic LPS binding protein, Toll like receptor 4, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor -α, and Kupffer cells infiltration. Furthermore, GC combination reduced LPS and D-lactate in plasma, restoring the colonic  (TJ) expression and inhibited colonic TJs disassembly by down-regulation on RhoA/ROCK signaling in NASH induced by HFD. On the other hand, NASH was also alleviated in NaB group. The results of the present study suggested the important role of protection on gut barrier function in NAFLD treatment, which contributed to the therapeutic effects of GC combination on NASH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31276135>Cinnamon subcritical water extract attenuates intestinal inflammation and enhances intestinal  in a Caco-2 and RAW264.7 co-culture model.</a></h1><p>Cinnamon is known to have several physiological effects; the effects of Cinnamomum japonicum Sieb. on anti-inflammation and  were investigated in the cellular intestinal inflammation model. Cinnamon subcritical water extract (CSWE) significantly down-regulated the protein and expression levels of nitrite, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity, and the phosphorylation of the factors of the NF-κB pathway.

Depending on cereal type (i.e. maize or wheat) and PFA inclusion level (i.e. 0, 100 and 150 mg/kg diet), 450 one-day-old male broilers were allocated in 6 treatments according to a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement with 5 replicates of 15 broilers each, for 42 d. Significant interactions ( ≤ 0.05) between cereal type and PFA were shown for cecal digesta  and  cluster XIVa, ileal digesta propionic and branched VFA, ileal  gene expression, as well as cecal digesta branched and other VFA molar ratios. Cereal type affected the cecal microbiota composition. In particular, wheat-fed broilers had higher levels of mucosa-associated  (  = 0.007) and digesta  (  < 0.001), as well as lower levels of total bacteria (  = 0.004) and  clusters I, IV and XIVa (  ≤ 0.05), compared with maize-fed ones. In addition, cereal type gave differences in fermentation intensity (  = 0.021) and in certain individual VFA molar ratios. Wheat-fed broilers had higher ( ≤ 0.05) ileal zonula occluden 2 () and lower ileal and cecal  and  levels, compared with maize-fed broilers. On the other hand, PFA inclusion at 150 mg/kg had a stimulating effect on microbial fermentation at ileum and a retarding effect in ceca with additional variable VFA molar patterns. In addition, PFA inclusion at 100 mg/kg increased the ileal mucosa expression of claudin 5 () (  = 0.023) and  (  = 0.001) genes, and at 150 mg/kg decreased cecal  (  = 0.022) gene expression compared with the un-supplemented controls. In conclusion, cereal type and PFA affected in combination and independently broiler gut microbiota composition and metabolic activity as well as the expression of critical gut barrier genes including .

Why neurohypophyseal capillaries become permeable while the neighboring vasculature of the brain forms BBB remains unclear. We show that pituicytes, the resident astroglial cells of the neurohypophysis, express genes that are associated with BBB breakdown during neuroinflammation. Pituicyte-enriched factors provide a local microenvironment that instructs a permeable neurovascular conduit. Thus, genetic and pharmacological perturbations of Vegfa and Tgfβ3 affected HNS vascular morphogenesis and permeability and impaired the expression of the fenestral marker plvap. The anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone decreased HNS permeability and downregulated the pituicyte-specific cyp26b gene, encoding a retinoic  catabolic enzyme. Inhibition of Cyp26b activity led to upregulation of  protein Claudin-5 and decreased permeability. We conclude that pituicyte-derived factors regulate the "decision" of endothelial cells to adopt a permeable endothelial fate instead of forming a BBB.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

To further characterize this model, we developed a differentiated primary ferret nasal epithelial cell (FNEC) culture model for investigation of influenza A virus infection and virus-host interactions. This well-differentiated culture consists of various cell types, a mucociliary clearance system, and , representing the nasal ciliated pseudostratified respiratory epithelium. Both α2,6-linked and α2,3-linked sialic  (SA) receptors, which preferentially bind the hemagglutinin (HA) of human and avian influenza viruses, respectively, were detected on the apical surface of the culture with different cellular tropisms. In accordance with the distribution of SA receptors, we observed that a pre-2009 seasonal A(H1N1) virus infected both ciliated and nonciliated cells, whereas a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus primarily infected nonciliated cells. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that virions were released from or associated with the apical membranes of ciliated, nonciliated, and mucin-secretory goblet cells. Upon infection, the HPAI A(H5N1) virus replicated to titers higher than those of the human A(H1N1) virus at 37°C; however, replication of the A(H5N1) virus was significantly attenuated at 33°C. Furthermore, we found that infection with the A(H5N1) virus induced higher expression levels of immune mediator genes and resulted in more cell damage/loss than with the human A(H1N1) virus. This primary differentiated FNEC culture model, recapitulating the structure of the nasal epithelium, provides a useful model to bridge  and  studies of cellular tropism, infectivity, and pathogenesis of influenza viruses during the initial stages of infection. Although ferrets serve as an important model of influenza virus infection, much remains unknown about virus-host interactions in this species at the cellular level. The development of differentiated primary cultures of ferret nasal epithelial cells is an important step toward understanding cellular tropism and the mechanisms of influenza virus infection and replication in the airway milieu of this model. Using lectin staining and microscopy techniques, we characterized the sialic  receptor distribution and the cellular composition of the culture model. We then evaluated the replication of and immune response to human and avian influenza viruses at relevant physiological temperatures. Our findings offer significant insight into this first line of defense against influenza virus infection and provide a model for the evaluation of emerging influenza viruses in a well-controlled  environmental setting.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31064006>A blend of fatty , organic , and phytochemicals induced changes in intestinal morphology and inflammatory gene expression in coccidiosis-vaccinated broiler chickens.</a></h1><p>Feed additives that promote gastrointestinal health may complement coccidiosis vaccination programs in antibiotic-free broiler production systems. This study examined the effects of a commercial feed additive blend (FA) on intestinal histomorphology and inflammatory biomarkers in vaccinated Ross 708 cockerels (N = 2,160). The study was a randomized complete block design (12 blocks) with 3 dietary treatments: CON (negative control), AGP (positive control: 55 ppm of bacitracin methylene disalicylate), and FA (1.5 kg/MT in starter; 1.0 kg/MT in grower; and 0.5 kg/MT in finisher). Birds were reared on re-used litter and fed a 3-phase feeding program (starter, 0 to 14 D; grower, 15 to 28 D; finisher, 29 to 36 D). One master batch of basal feed for each feeding phase was prepared and final experimental diets were manufactured by mixing the basal feed with the respective test ingredient prior to pelleting. Growth measurements, including pen body weight and feed intakes, and fresh fecal samples were taken throughout the study. On day 20, samples of intestinal tissue were collected from a subset of birds (n = 72, 1 block) for histomorphology and mRNA expression of  and inflammatory genes. In the duodenum, the ratio of villi length to crypt depth was significantly lower in FA (and AGP) fed birds than those consuming the CON diet. Relative mRNA expressions of iNOS, IFNƔ, and claudin-1 were upregulated in the jejunum of FA and AGP treatment groups compared to those in the CON group; the response in the FA was of lesser magnitude than AGP. Together, these results demonstrated that the FA treatment altered the microstructure of the duodenum and affected the expression of inflammatory genes in the jejunum. The timing of these changes coincided with peak oocyte shedding in feces and an observed reduction in feed efficiency in all dietary treatment groups.© The Author(s) 2019.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of grape peel powder (GPP) and its bioactive rich-fractions on the barrier function and colonic injury in a model of colitis induced by 2,4,6 trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS). Wistar rats received diets supplemented with either GPP (8%), extractable polyphenols (EP), non-extractable polyphenols-rich fraction (NEP-F), or polyphenols-poor, fiber-rich fraction (F) from grapes at amounts equivalent to the GPP group during 15 days before and for 7 days after colitis induction. NEP-F has decreased the extension of colonic lesion but the other grape peel bioactive fractions did not protect against macroscopic or microscopic colonic damage, EP diet increased macroscopic colonic damage. GPP, EP, and NEP-F reduced claudin-2 mRNA expression, whereas GPP and F fraction increased occludin and ZO-1 mRNA expression. All experimental diets reduced the colitis-triggered increase of MMP-9 mRNA expression. Colitis reduced by 30% the production of cecal short-chain fatty  (SCFA). GPP and NEP-F completely protected against this effect, whereas F fraction was ineffective. Only GPP and NEP-F were able to decrease the upregulation of GRP94 mRNA triggered by colitis. Dietary fiber seems to reestablish the intestinal barrier function, whereas fiber-bound phenolics were able to restore cecal metabolism to produce beneficial metabolites like SCFA and to reduce the activation of the unfolded protein response.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent evidence suggests that intestinal mucosal barrier damage and intestinal dysbiosis occur in mice with hepatic fibrosis induced by CCl4 or bile duct ligation. Another study showed that ursolic  (UA) attenuates experimental colitis via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of UA on the intestinal mucosal barrier in CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats and identify its associated mechanisms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the following 3 groups ( = 10/group): the control, CCl4 model and UA treatment groups. Rats were sacrificed at 72 h after the hepatic fibrosis model was established and assessed for liver fibrosis, intestinal injury, enterocyte apoptosis, bacterial translocation, system inflammation, intestinal oxidative stress, and  protein and NOX protein expression. The results demonstrated that UA attenuated the following: (i) liver and intestinal pathological injury; (ii) cleaved caspase-3 expression in the ileal epithelial cells; (iii) serum lipopolysaccharide and procalcitonin levels; (iv) intestinal malondialdehyde levels; and (v) the expression of the NOX protein components NOX2 and P67phox in ileal tissues. Furthermore, our results suggested that UA improved intestinal dysbiosis and the expression of the  proteins Claudin 1 and Occludin in the ileum of rats. These results indicate that UA has protective effects on the intestinal mucosal barrier in rats with CCl4-induced liver fibrosis by inhibiting intestinal NOX-mediated oxidative stress.

Milk polar lipids, lipids derived from the milk fat globule membrane, could positively affect the aforementioned obesity-related endpoints. This study aimed to test the hypotheses that milk polar lipids will reduce gut permeability, systemic inflammation, and liver lipid levels, and differentially affect the hepatic expression of genes associated with fatty  synthesis and cholesterol regulation in preexisting obesity. We fed 3 groups of C57BL/6J ob/ob mice (n = 6 per group) for 2 wk: (1) a modified AIN-93G diet (CO) with 34% fat by energy; (2) CO with milk gangliosides (GG) at 0.2 g/kg of diet; and (3) CO with milk phospholipids (PL) at 10 g/kg of diet. The GG and PL were provided as semi-purified concentrates and replaced 2.0% and 7.2% of dietary fat by energy. The GG and PL did not affect total food intake, weight gain, fasting glucose, or gut permeability. The PL decreased liver mass and the mesenteric fat depot compared with the CO. The GG increased  protein occludin in colon mucosa compared with the CO. The GG and PL decreased  protein zonula occludens-1 in jejunum mucosa compared with the CO. Plasma endotoxin increased during the study but was unaffected by the treatments. Compared with the CO and GG, the PL increased plasma sphingomyelin and plasma IL-6. The GG and PL differentially regulated genes associated with lipid metabolism in the liver compared with the CO. Regarding general effects on lipid metabolism, the GG and PL decreased lipid levels in the liver and the mesenteric depot, and increased lipid levels in the plasma. Diet consumption decreased significantly when the ob/ob mice were kept in metabolic cages, which were not big enough and resulted in unwanted animal deaths. Future studies may keep this in mind and use better metabolic equipment for ob/ob mice. In conclusion, dietary milk polar lipids may have limited beneficial effects on gut barrier integrity, systemic inflammation, and lipid metabolism in the context of severe obesity.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) remain central to the interplay between the host and microbial milieu. We propose that Tregs are involved in promoting gut barrier integrity and a balanced interaction with gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty  (SCFAs). Carbon tetrachloride cirrhosis was induced in wild-type and recombination activating gene 1 () mice. Naive T cells and Treg cells were transferred into   mice. Intestinal permeability was assessed  after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) oral administration, and bacterial DNA presence was evaluated in mesenteric lymph nodes. Transcript and protein levels of  (TJ) proteins were measured in colonic tissue. Intestinal T helper profile in response to  () was determined by flow cytometry. SCFAs were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in colonic content before and after  challenge.   mice showed significantly increased permeability to LPS and bacterial DNA translocation rate compared with control mice. Naive T and Treg cotransfer significantly reduced gut permeability to bacterial antigen translocation and restored TJ protein expression in   mice. Naive T and Treg replenishment in   mice restrained proinflammatory differentiation of intestinal lymphocytes in response to . The main SCFA concentration resulted in significant reduction in   mice after  administration but remained unaltered after naive T and Tregs cotransfer. The reduced expression of SCFA receptors induced by  was reestablished following naive T and Treg reconstitution in   mice.  The restriction of gut permeability, local inflammatory differentiation, and loss of bacteria-derived SCFAs foster the value of Tregs in preventing bacterial translocation in cirrhosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30502400>Lactation diminishes lesion-induced permeability of tracers into the brain.</a></h1><p>Diminished sensitivity to kainic  (KA) lesioning action is present in the hippocampus of the lactating dam. Given that KA can alter blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, we investigated whether lactation would protect BBB permeability after treatment with this neurotoxin. Adult virgin or lactating (13-15 days pp) female Wistar rats were injected with an i.p. (10 mg/kg b.w.) or i.c.v. (100 ng/1 μl) KA dose. Control groups received a similar volume of vehicle. BBB permeability was assessed by an injection of fluorescent FITC-conjugated dextran tracer (40 kDa, 50 mg/500 μl) or of 4% Evans blue dye (500 μl), given 24 h after KA administration. Extravasation of dye or tracer was detected in virgin but not in lactating rats exposed to KA. In particular, increased extravasation of FITC-dextran was detected in the hippocampal subfields CA1 and CA3 and in the cerebral cortex of virgin rats that received KA, while lactating rats showed increased label for FITC-dextran only in the cerebral cortex. Western blot analysis of  proteins showed a decrease of claudin-5 and occludin but not of zonula occludens-1 in the hippocampus of both virgin and lactating rats. These results allow us to conclude that the BBB of lactating rats is less sensitive to KA lesioning action in comparison to that of virgin rats by mechanisms different than those of  proteins.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigated the influence of propolis on the gut microbiota and intestinal mucosa in rats with diabetes.Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to the control group, model group, and three propolis groups (supplemented with 80, 160, and 240 mg/kg·bw propolis, respectively). A high-fat diet combined with a streptozotocin (STZ) abdominal injection were used to induce diabetes in the rats. After 4 weeks, the intestinal histopathological analysis of the ileum was observed by transmission electron microscopy. The fasting blood glucose (FBG), plasma insulin, glucose tolerance (OGTT) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were measured. The expression of  (TJ) proteins in the ileum was measured using western blotting. The molecular ecology of the fecal gut microbiota was analyzed by 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing. The contents of the short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) in feces were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).After propolis treatment, compared to the model group, FBG and HbA1c levels declined, while the glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) increased. The levels of TJ proteins in the ileum increased in the propolis groups. The  and gap  of the intestinal epithelium were also improved in the propolis groups. The contents of the feces acetic , propionic  and butyrate were increased in the propolis groups. 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing revealed that the composition of the gut microbiota of rats in the propolis supplement group was significantly improved.Compared to the model group, propolis exerted hypoglycemic effects in diabetic rats, and it repaired intestinal mucosal damage, benefited the communities of the gut microbiota and increased SCFA levels in diabetic rats.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

These molecules may promote drug absorption by several different processes, including solubilization, increased membrane fluidity, and increased paracellular transport through opening of the . Therefore, understanding the aggregation behavior of MCFAs is important. A number of studies have measured the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of MCFAs experimentally. However, CMC is highly dependent on system conditions like pH, temperature, and the ionic strength of the buffer used in different experimental techniques. In this study, we investigated the aggregation behavior of four different MCFAs using the coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations with the purpose to explore if CG-MD can be used to study MCFA interactions occurring in water. The ratio of deprotonated and non-charged MCFA molecules were manipulated to assess aggregation behavior under different pH conditions and within the box sizes of 22 × 22 × 44 nm and 44 nm for 1 μs. CMCs were calculated by performing CG-MD simulations with an increasing number of MCFAs. The resulting aggregate size distribution and number of free MCFA molecules were used to determine the CMC. The CMCs from simulations for C, C, and C were 1.8-3.5-fold lower than the respective CMCs determined experimentally by the Wilhelmy method. However, the variation of MCFA aggregate sizes and morphologies at different pH conditions is consistent with previous experimental observation. Overall, this study suggests that CG-MD is suitable for studying colloidal systems including various MCFAs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30977990>Signalling Effects Induced by  Ceramidase in Human Epithelial Or Leukemic Cell Lines.</a></h1><p>Recent studies indicated that an inhalation treatment of cystic fibrosis mice with  ceramidase prevents and eliminates infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stapyhlococcus aureus. Inhalation of  ceramidase facilitated the elimination of P. aeruginosa in acutely- or chronically-infected mice with cystic fibrosis. Thus, inhalation of  ceramidase might be a preventive and/or curative treatment for patients with cystic fibrosis suffering from pneumonia.We treated cultured epithelial cells or leukemic T-lymphocytes (Jurkat cells) with purified  ceramidase and determined intracellular signalling events, proliferation and cell survival. Specifically, we measured the activity of AKT, p38-kinase and p70S6-kinase using activation-specific phospho-antibodies in western blot studies. Trypan Blue staining served to analyze proliferation and cell survival.Our studies indicate that treatment of Chang epithelial cells or Jurkat T lymphocytes with purified  ceramidase results in a dose dependent activation of AKT, p38-kinase and p70S6-kinase, while tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins remains largely unchanged.  ceramidase treatment did not change expression of  proteins such as ZO-1, ZO-2 and occludin. Cellular viability and proliferation were not affected by  ceramidase treatment.Our data suggest that treatment of epithelial cells and lymphocytes with  ceramidase results in activation of distinct pathways, in particular AKT- and p38K-dependent pathways, while no global activation or cell death was observed.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Experiments were conducted in broiler chickens to evaluate supplementation of L-glutamine, glycine, and L-arginine in a reduced protein (RP) diet. Experiment 1 examined the growth performance of broilers fed 5 dietary treatments: 1) a standard diet; 2) an RP diet (193.9 g/kg CP in grower and 176.9 g/kg CP in finisher); 3) RP diet supplemented with 10 g/kg L-Gln; 4) RP diet supplemented with 10 g/kg Gly; 5) RP diet supplemented with 5 g/kg L-Arg. Each experimental diet was replicated 6 times with 10 birds per replicate. In a subset of 96 birds, experiment 2 tested the 4 RP diets with and without dexamethasone (DEX) to induce leaky gut. Each diet was replicated 24 times. Fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) was used to test intestinal permeability (IP). Gene expression of selected  proteins in ileal and jejunal tissues was assayed by quantitative PCR. From day 7 to 35, the RP diet increased feed intake (FI) (P < 0.05) and body weight gain (BWG) compared with the standard diet while Gln reduced FI and BWG (P < 0.05) compared with RP. Gly had no effect on BWG or FCR. Supplementation of Arg improved FCR from day 21 to 35 and day 7 to 35. In experiment 2, Arg tended to lower FITC-d (P = 0.086). DEX increased passage of FITC-d into the serum (P < 0.001). The villi surface area was increased in birds fed higher Arg (P < 0.05). DEX and diet interacted (P < 0.01) for jejunal claudin-3 mRNA level where DEX upregulated claudin-3 for all diets except the Arg diet. In summary, with a moderate reduction of protein, satisfactory performance can be obtained. Although Gln and Gly had no demonstrable positive effect on IP and performance of broilers, increasing the dietary Arg by approximately 140% improved FCR and showed indications of improved intestinal barrier function of birds fed an RP diet under a stress model.© The Author(s) 2019.

Endothelial WNT signaling is a known driver of brain vascular development and BBB properties, however, it is unclear how endothelial WNT signaling is regulated. We recently showed that mouse embryos with disruptions in endothelial retinoic  (RA) signaling have ectopic WNT signaling in the brain vasculature. Using immunohistochemistical analysis, we show that increased vascular WNT signaling in RA mutants ( ;  and  mutants) is associated with elevated expression of the WNT transcriptional effector, β-catenin, in the brain endothelium.  immunocytochemistry and proximity ligation studies in brain endothelial cells reveal that RA, through its receptor RARα, regulates β-catenin expression in brain endothelial cells via transcriptional suppression and phosphorylation events that targets β-catenin for proteasomal degradation, the latter dependent on PKCα. We find that one function of RA in regulating vascular WNT signaling is to modulate the pericyte numbers in the developing brain vasculature. RA-mediated regulation of vascular WNT signaling could be needed to prevent over-recruitment of pericytes that might impair endothelial-pericyte interactions crucial for vascular stability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30979002>Synbiotic Supplementation Containing Whole Plant Sugar Cane Fibre and Probiotic Spores Potentiates Protective Synergistic Effects in Mouse Model of IBD.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a chronic inflammatory disorders with increasing global incidence. Synbiotic, which is a two-point approach carrying probiotic and prebiotic components in mitigating inflammation in IBD, is thought to be a pragmatic approach owing to the synergistic outcomes. In this study, the impacts of dietary supplementation with probiotic  MTCC5856 spores () and prebiotic whole plant sugar cane fibre (PSCF) was assessed using a murine model of IBD. Eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal chow diet supplemented with either , PSCF or its synbiotic combination. After seven days of supplementation, colitis was induced with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for seven days during the continuation of the supplemented diets. Synbiotic supplementation ameliorated disease activity index and histological score (-72%, 7.38, respectively), more effectively than either  (-47%, 10.1) and PSCF (-53%, 13.0) alone. Synbiotic supplementation also significantly ( < 0.0001) prevented the expression of  proteins and modulated the altered serum IL-1β (-40%), IL-10 (+26%), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (-39%) levels. Synbiotic supplementations also raised the short-chain fatty  (SCFA) profile more extensively compared to the unsupplemented DSS-control. The synbiotic health outcome effect of the probiotic and prebiotic combinations may be associated with a synergistic direct immune-regulating efficacy of the components, their ability to protect epithelial integrity, stimulation of probiotic spores by the prebiotic fibre, and/or with stimulation of greater levels of fermentation of fibres releasing SCFAs that mediate the reduction in colonic inflammation. Our model findings suggest synbiotic supplementation should be tested in clinical trials.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30903547>Sodium Butyrate Ameliorates Intestinal Injury and Improves Survival in a Rat Model of Cecal Ligation and Puncture-Induced Sepsis.</a></h1><p>Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with a high rate of mortality. Unfortunately, very few therapies can improve outcomes in patients with sepsis. Butyrate, which is the most potent histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor among short-chain fatty , exerts anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of inflammatory diseases. Butyrate might thus be valuable in the treatment of sepsis, in which inhibition of overwhelming cytokine release is vitally important. Sepsis was induced in 7- to 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) with a 21-g double-puncture technique. Rats received an intravenous injection of normal saline (vehicle) or sodium butyrate (200 mg/kg) after CLP and were sacrificed 12 h later. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to observe the intestinal mucosal morphology. RT-PCR and ELISA were used to determine the intestinal inflammatory response in vivo. Intestinal permeability was evaluated by measuring fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FD-4) absorption in vivo, and  protein expression was examined by western blot. NF-κB p65 activities were assessed by western blot and immunohistochemistry. Sodium butyrate treatment improved the survival rate of CLP rats and alleviated sepsis-induced intestinal mucosal injury. Proinflammatory cytokine expression was lower in butyrate-treated rats than in the vehicle group. FD-4 leakage from the intestinal tract was reduced, and the expression levels of the  proteins claudin-1 and ZO-1 were also restored in rats that received sodium butyrate treatment. These effects were associated with less NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation, whereas the expression of Iκ-Bα was not affected or even increased. Sodium butyrate mitigates the inflammatory response and maintains intestinal barrier function in polymicrobial sepsis partly through inhibition of NF-κB activation and may serve as a novel therapy for sepsis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31319027>Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) Protects against the Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Impairment of the Intestinal Epithelial Barrier Function via the FXR-MLCK Pathway.</a></h1><p>Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), a primary bile , has been demonstrated to play important roles as a signaling molecule in various physiology functions. However, the role of CDCA in regulating intestinal barrier function remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of CDCA on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function and explore the underlying mechanisms. In IPEC-J2 cells, CDCA reversed the LPS-induced increase in transepithelial electrical resistance and decrease in  protein expression. In addition, we found that farnesoid X receptor (FXR) but not Takeda G-protein receptor 5 was responsible for the CDCA-improved epithelial barrier function impaired by LPS. Furthermore, CDCA blocked LPS-induced activation of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) pathway in a FXR-dependent manner and elicited similar effects to MLCK inhibition. In mice, CDCA supplementation restored LPS-induced elevation of intestinal permeability and MLCK expression and reduction of  protein expression, thus alleviating LPS-induced intestinal barrier impairment. In conclusion, CDCA protected against the LPS-induced impairment of the intestinal epithelial barrier function via the FXR-MLCK pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30451503>Rainbow Trout Maintain Intestinal Transport and Barrier Functions Following Exposure to Polystyrene Microplastics.</a></h1><p>Ingestion has been proposed as a prominent exposure route for plastic debris in aquatic organisms, including fish. While the consequences of ingestion of large plastic litter are mostly understood, the impacts resulting from ingestion of microplastics (MPs) are largely unknown. We designed a study that aimed to assess impacts of MPs on fish intestinal physiology and examined integrity of extrinsic, physical and immunological barriers. Rainbow trout were exposed to polystyrene (PS) MPs (100-400 μm) via feed for a period of 4 weeks. Fish were fed four types of diets: control, diets containing virgin PS particles, or particles exposed to two different environmental matrices (sewage or harbor effluent). Extrinsic barrier disturbance in intestinal tissue was evaluated via histology. The paracellular permeability toward ions and molecules was examined using Ussing chambers and mRNA expression analysis of  proteins. Active transport was monitored as transepithelial potential difference, short-circuits current and uptake rate of amino  H-lysine. Immune status parameters were measured through mRNA expression level of cytokines, lysozyme activity, and hematological analysis of immune cells. We could not show that PS MPs induced inflammatory responses or acted as physical or chemical hazards upon ingestion. No measurable effects were exerted on fish intestinal permeability, active transport or electrophysiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927418>Formation of organotypic testicular organoids in microwell culture†.</a></h1><p>Three-dimensional (3D) organoids can serve as an in vitro platform to study cell-cell interactions, tissue development, and toxicology. Development of organoids with tissue architecture similar to testis in vivo has remained a challenge. Here, we present a microwell aggregation approach to establish multicellular 3D testicular organoids from pig, mouse, macaque, and human. The organoids consist of germ cells, Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and peritubular myoid cells forming a distinct seminiferous epithelium and interstitial compartment separated by a basement membrane. Sertoli cells in the organoids express  proteins claudin 11 and occludin. Germ cells in organoids showed an attenuated response to retinoic  compared to germ cells in 2D culture indicating that the tissue architecture of the organoid modulates response to retinoic  similar to in vivo. Germ cells maintaining physiological cell-cell interactions in organoids also had lower levels of autophagy indicating lower levels of cellular stress. When organoids were treated with mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), levels of germ cell autophagy increased in a dose-dependent manner, indicating the utility of the organoids for toxicity screening. Ablation of primary cilia on testicular somatic cells inhibited the formation of organoids demonstrating an application to screen for factors affecting testicular morphogenesis. Organoids can be generated from cryopreserved testis cells and preserved by vitrification. Taken together, the testicular organoid system recapitulates the 3D organization of the mammalian testis and provides an in vitro platform for studying germ cell function, testicular development, and drug toxicity in a cellular context representative of the testis in vivo.© The Author(s) 2019.

Although the bovine G6P[5] WC3 strain is an important animal pathogen and is also used in the bovine-human reassortant RotaTeq vaccine, the receptor(s) for the VP8* domain of WC3 and its reassortant strains have not yet been identified. In the present study, HBGA- and saliva-binding assays showed that both G6P[5] WC3 and mono-reassortant G4P[5] strains recognized the αGal HBGA. The infectivity of both P[5]-bearing strains was significantly reduced in αGal-free MA-104 cells by pretreatment with a broadly specific neuraminidase or by coincubation with the α2,6-linked SA-specific  lectin, but not by the α2,3-linked specific sialidase or by  lectin. Free NeuAc and the αGal trisaccharide also prevented the infectivity of both strains. This indicated that both P[5]-bearing strains utilize α2,6-linked SA as a ligand on MA104 cells. However, the two strains replicated in differentiated bovine small intestinal enteroids and in their human counterparts that lack α2,6-linked SA or αGal HBGA, suggesting that additional or alternative receptors such as integrins, hsp70, and  proteins bound directly to the VP5* domain can be used by the P[5]-bearing strains to initiate the infection of human cells. In addition, these data also suggested that P[5]-bearing strains have potential for cross-species transmission. Group A rotaviruses initiate infection through the binding of the VP8* domain of the VP4 protein to sialic  (SAs) or histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). Although the bovine G6P[5] WC3 strain is an important animal pathogen and is used as the backbone in the bovine-human reassortant RotaTeq vaccine, the receptor(s) for their P[5] VP8* domain has remained elusive. Using a variety of approaches, we demonstrated that the WC3 and bovine-human mono-reassortant G4P[5] vaccine strains recognize both α2,6-linked SA and αGal HBGA as ligands. Neither ligand is expressed on human small intestinal epithelial cells, explaining the absence of natural human infection by P[5]-bearing strains. However, we observed that the P[5]-bearing WC3 and G4P[5] RotaTeq vaccine strains could still infect human intestinal epithelial cells. Thus, the four P[5] RotaTeq vaccine strains potentially binding to additional alternative receptors may be efficient and effective in providing protection against severe rotavirus disease in human.Copyright © 2019 Alfajaro et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31118630>Enhanced transdermal permeability and drug deposition of rheumatoid arthritis via sinomenine hydrochloride-loaded antioxidant surface transethosome.</a></h1><p> Transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS) curing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for long-term treatment can improve patients' compliance and reduce the accumulation of drug side effects. However, TDDS is constrained by the  of the stratum corneum and low permeation efficiency. It is necessary to adopt proper permeation methods to ensure the therapeutic effect. The transethosome (TE), which is derived from transfersome and ethosome (E), containing a high content of ethanol along with an edge activator or permeation enhancer, has superior deformability and higher permeation efficiency.  In this study, sinomenine hydrochloride-loaded TE was decorated with ascorbic  to form antioxidant surface transethosome (AS-TE). It was revealed that TE and AS-TE containing sodium deoxycholate can effectively increase the entrapment efficiency of hydrophilic drug, and has superior deformability and higher permeation efficiency than E group. The plasma pharmacokinetics of rabbits showed that TE group and AS-TE group had similar blood concentration and bioavailability; however, micro-dialysis on synovial fluid demonstrated that AS-TE group had higher drug concentration. In RA rat models, the alleviation of the joint swell of AS-TE group was more obvious in the course of 3 weeks of treatment. The inflammatory cytokines and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were significantly lower than those in the negative control group and TE1 group.  AS-TE, which can enhance transdermal permeability and drug deposition for the oxidant stress of RA, had further research potential to serve as a TDDS of RA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31377676>Molecular cloning, expression and biological activity of rhesus macaque interleukin-17A and interleukin-17F.</a></h1><p>Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and interleukin-17F (IL-17F) as two potent proinflammatory cytokines and the signature cytokines of Th17 cells play important roles in human autoimmune diseases, inflammation and host defenses. In this study, rhesus macaque IL-17A (rhIL-17A) and IL-17F (rhIL-17F) were cloned and expressed, and their biological activities and in vivo distribution were examined. The resulting data showed that both the rhIL-17A and rhIL-17F genes were consisted of three exons and two introns. RhIL-17A and rhIL-17F shared 96.8% and 93.9% amino  sequence identity with human IL-17A (huIL-17A) and IL-17F (huIL-17F) respectively and the sequences also shared one N-glycosylation site and six conserved cysteine residues with huIL-17A and huIL-17F. IL-17A and IL-17F transcripts were highly expressed in lymphoid tissues and the intestinal tract of rhesus macaques. Functionally, recombinant rhIL-17A and rhIL-17F showed similar effect on Act1 levels and NF-κB phosphorylation compared with that of commercial human IL-17A and IL-17F. Moreover, the antibacterial proteins (such as β-defensin 2, S100A8, S100A9, RegIIIα and Muc1) and the  associated genes (including CLDN1, CLDN4, OCLN, and ZO1) expressed by Caco-2 cells were largely enhanced after treatment with rhIL-17A and rhIL-17F. Meanwhile, purified rhIL-17A and rhIL-17F could also induce the expression of IL-6 and TNF-α by THP-1 cells. These data indicated that rhesus macaque IL-17A and IL-17F are highly similar to that of humans in both structure and function.

Moreover, only L. plantarum A41 and L. fermentum SRK414 could increase gut barrier function by upregulating the mRNA expression of  proteins and inhibit the expression of inflammatory mediators induced by LPS-stimulated inflammation. Interestingly, these two strains were also capable of regulating several bone metabolism-related markers playing a role in bone homeostasis and osteoblast differentiation.

In our study, we not only confirmed that inducible expression of kAE1 in mIMCD3 cells decreased TEER but we also observed (i) increased epithelial absolute permeability to both sodium and chloride, and (ii) that this effect was dependent on kAE1 activity. Further, kAE1 regulated  properties through the  protein claudin-4, a protein with which it physically interacts and colocalizes. These findings unveil a novel interaction between the junctional protein claudin-4 and the kidney anion exchanger, which may be relevant to ion and/or pH homeostasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30623851>Alterations to the microbiota-colon-brain axis in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice compared to diet-resistant mice.</a></h1><p>Obesity is underpinned by both genetic and environmental factors, including a high-saturated-fat diet. Some mice develop diet-induced obesity (DIO), but others remain diet resistant (DR) despite intake of the same high-saturated-fat diet, a phenomenon that mimics characteristics of the human obese phenotype. Microbiota-colon-brain axis regulation is important for energy metabolism and cognition. Using DIO and DR mouse models, this study aimed to examine gut microbiota, colonic inflammation and cognitive function to elucidate the role of microbiota-gut-brain regulation in DIO. C57Bl6/J mice fed a chronic saturated-palmitic- diet for 22 weeks showed significant body weight gain differences, with the top one third gaining 48% heavier body weight than the lower one third. There was significant reduction in gut microbiota richness and diversity in DIO mice but not in DR mice. At the phylum level, DIO mice had increased abundance of Firmicutes and Antinobacteria, and decreased abundance of Bacterioides and Proteobacteria in gut microbiota. DIO mice exhibited reduced  proteins, increased plasma endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and increased inflammation in the colon and liver. Recognition memory and spatial memory were impaired in DIO mice, associated with decreased Bacteroidetes. Further examination showed that hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor was significantly decreased in DIO mice (vs. DR). Conversely, DR mice showed no changes in the above parameters measured. Therefore, gut microbiota, colon inflammation and circulating LPS may play a major role in the development of the obese phenotype and cognitive decline associated with a chronic high-saturated-palmitic- diet.Copyright © 2018.

In vitro transepithelial electric resistance (TER) and FITC-dextran diffusion were measured in different cell lines. In vivo FITC-dextran was injected in the gallbladder (GB) lumen and traced in plasma.  proteins and TGR5-induced signalling were investigated in vitro and in vivo (wild-type [WT] and TGR5-KO livers and GB). WT and TGR5-KO mice were submitted to bile duct ligation or alpha-naphtylisothiocyanate intoxication under vehicle or TGR5 agonist treatment, and liver injury was studied.In vitro TGR5 stimulation increased TER and reduced paracellular permeability for dextran. In vivo dextran diffusion after GB injection was increased in TGR5-knock-out (KO) as compared with WT mice and decreased on TGR5 stimulation. In TGR5-KO bile ducts and GB, junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A) was hypophosphorylated and selectively downregulated among TJP analysed. TGR5 stimulation induced JAM-A phosphorylation and stabilisation both in vitro and in vivo, associated with protein kinase C-ζ activation. TGR5 agonist-induced TER increase as well as JAM-A protein stabilisation was dependent on JAM-A Ser285 phosphorylation. TGR5 agonist-treated mice were protected from cholestasis-induced liver injury, and this protection was significantly impaired in JAM-A-KO mice.The BA receptor TGR5 regulates biliary epithelial barrier function in vitro and in vivo through an impact on JAM-A expression and phosphorylation, thereby protecting liver parenchyma against bile leakage.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Recently, increasing evidence supports the notion that certain probiotic-derived components, such as bacteriocins, lipoteichoic , surface layer protein and secreted protein, have a similar protective role on intestinal barrier function as that of live probiotics. These bioactive components have been named 'postbiotics' in the most recent publications. We previously found that the  GG (LGG) culture supernatant is able to accelerate the maturation of neonatal intestinal defense and prevent neonatal rats from oral  K1 infection. However, the identity of the bioactive constituents has not yet been determined. In this study, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, we identified a novel secreted protein (named HM0539 here) involved in the beneficial effect of LGG culture supernatant. HM0539 was recombinated, purified, and applied for exploring its potential bioactivity  and . Our results showed that HM0539 exhibits a potent protective effect on the intestinal barrier, as reflected by enhancing intestinal mucin expression and preventing against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-induced intestinal barrier injury, including downregulation of intestinal mucin (MUC2), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and disruption of the intestinal integrity. Using a neonatal rat model of  K1 infection via the oral route, we verified that HM0539 is sufficient to promote development of neonatal intestinal defense and prevent against  K1 pathogenesis. Moreover, we further extended the role of HM0539 and found it has potential to prevent dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis as well as LPS/D-galactosamine-induced bacterial translocation and liver injury. In conclusion, we identified a novel LGG postbiotic HM0539 which exerts a protective effect on intestinal barrier function. Our findings indicated that HM0539 has potential to become a useful agent for prevention and treatment of intestinal barrier dysfunction- related diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592954>[Effects of exogenous hydrogen sulfide on intestinal function in rabbits after cardiopulmonary resuscitation].</a></h1><p>To investigate the effect of exogenous hydrogen sulfide (HS) on intestinal mucosal barrier after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in cardiac arrest (CA) rabbits.Forty-four male New Zealand rabbits were divided into sham operation group (Sham group, n = 12), post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) group (n = 16) and H2S intervention group (PCAS+NaHS, n = 16) according to random number table method. The rabbit model of PCAS was established by tracheal clamping and suffocation, and CPR was started at 5 minutes after CA. However, Sham group did not clamp the tracheal intubation after anesthesia, and the other operations were the same as those in PCAS group. In the PCAS+NaHS group, a bolus of NaHS (0.5 mg/kg), a H2S donor, was injected via era vein 1 minute before the start of CPR, followed by a continuous injection of NaHS (1.5 mg×kg×h) for 3 hours, while the rabbits in other group were intravenously injected with the same volume of normal saline (NaCl 0.9%). Intestinal and portal vein blood samples were collected 24 hours after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The level of serum fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FD-4) was detected by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeling method to reflect intestinal mucosal permeability. After hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining of small intestine tissues, the morphological changes of mucosa were observed under light microscope, and the intestinal mucosa injury score was calculated. The expression of  protein ZO-1 in intestinal mucosa was detected by immunohistochemistry. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in small intestinal tissue was determined by thiobarbituric  chromogenic method, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was determined by xanthine oxidation method, and the level of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was determined by double antibody sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to reflect the oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction in small intestinal tissue. The expression of apoptosis protein (caspase-3) and autophagy related protein (Beclin-1, LC3) in small intestine tissue was detected by Western Blot.12, 13 and 14 animals were successfully resuscitated in Sham group, PCAS group and PCAS+NaHS group respectively, while 12 animals in each group survived to the end of experiment. Compared with Sham group, the level of FD-4 in portal vein serum was significantly increased in PCAS group (mg/L: 11.95±0.59 vs. 1.43±0.48, P < 0.05), the pathological injury and inflammation infiltration were obviously aggravated under light microscope, the score of small intestine injury was significantly increased (4.21±0.37 vs. 0.36±0.18, P < 0.05), the expression of  protein ZO-1 in the intestine was visibly down-regulated detected by immunohistochemistry, MDA content and MPO activity were significantly increased [MDA (nmol/mg): 3.65±0.32 vs. 1.54±0.24, MPO (U/g): 362±35 vs. 134±18, both P < 0.05], while SOD activity was significantly decreased (U/mg: 78.84±7.49 vs. 115.48±8.48, P < 0.05), the expression levels of cleaved capase-3, Beclin-1 and LC3 proteins in the intestine were significantly increased (caspase-3/β-actin: 1.11±0.08 vs. 0.21±0.02, Beclin-1/β-actin: 2.08±0.11 vs. 0.42±0.03, LC3/β-actin: 1.05±0.07 vs. 0.37±0.05, LC3-II/LC3-I: 1.28±0.14 vs. 0.17±0.02, all P < 0.05).

RNA-seq of ileum tissue revealed up-regulation of several genes involved in cell proliferation and stem cell renewal, and anti-microbial defense (including Alpi and Leap2) in fat-1 vs WT mice fed ethanol.  fat-1 mice were also resistant to ethanol-mediated down-regulation of genes important for xenobiotic/bile  detoxification.  Further, gut microbiome and plasma metabolomics revealed several changes in fat-1 vs. WT mice that may contribute to a reduced inflammatory response.  Finally, these data correlated with a significant reduction in liver injury.  Our study suggests that w3-PUFA enrichment or treatment with resolvins can attenuate the disruption in alcohol-induced intestinal homeostasis caused by ethanol consumption and systemic inflammation with a concomitant reduction in liver injury.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31167787>Protein painting, an optimized MS-based technique, reveals functionally relevant interfaces of the PD-1/PD-L1 complex and the YAP2/ZO-1 complex.</a></h1><p>Protein-protein interactions lie at the heart of many biological processes and therefore represent promising drug targets. Despite this opportunity, identification of protein-protein interfaces remains challenging. We have previously developed a method that relies on coating protein surfaces with small-molecule dyes to discriminate between solvent-accessible protein surfaces and hidden interface regions. Dye-bound, solvent-accessible protein regions resist trypsin digestion, whereas hidden interface regions are revealed by denaturation and sequenced by MS. The small-molecule dyes bind promiscuously and with high affinity, but their binding mechanism is unknown. Here, we report on the optimization of a novel dye probe used in protein painting, Fast Blue B + naphthionic , and show that its affinity for proteins strongly depends on hydrophobic moieties that we call here "hydrophobic clamps." We demonstrate the utility of this probe by sequencing the protein-protein interaction regions between the Hippo pathway protein Yes-associated protein 2 (YAP2) and  protein 1 (TJP1 or ZO-1), uncovering interactions via the known binding domain as well as ZO-1's MAGUK domain and YAP's N-terminal proline-rich domain. Additionally, we demonstrate how residues predicted by protein painting are present exclusively in the complex interface and how these residues may guide the development of peptide inhibitors using a case study of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). Inhibitors designed around the PD-1/PD-L1 interface regions identified via protein painting effectively disrupted complex formation, with the most potent inhibitor having an IC of 5 μm.© 2019 Haymond et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30581478>Colquhounia Root Tablet Protects Rat Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Cells against TNF--Induced Injury by Upregulating the Expression of  Proteins Claudin-5 and ZO-1.</a></h1><p>There are currently limited effective pharmacotherapy agents for acute lung injury (ALI). Inflammatory response in the lungs is the main pathophysiological process of ALI. Our preliminary data have shown that colquhounia root tablet (CRT), a natural herbal medicine, alleviates the pulmonary inflammatory responses and edema in a rat model with oleic -induced ALI. However, the potential molecular action mechanisms underlining its protective effects against ALI are poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanism of CRT in rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMEC) with TNF--induced injury.PMECs were divided into 6 groups: normal control, TNF- (10 ng/mL TNF-), Dex (1×10 M Dex + 10 ng/mL TNF-), CRT high (1000 ng/mL CRT + 10 ng/mL TNF-), CRT medium (500 ng/mL CRT + 10 ng/mL TNF-), and CRT low group (250 ng/mL CRT + 10 ng/mL TNF-). Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by MTT assay and flow cytometry. Cell micromorphology was observed under transmission electron microscope. The localization and expression of  proteins Claudin-5 and ZO-1 were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot, respectively.TNF-a had successfully induced an acute endothelial cell injury model. Dex and CRT treatments had significantly stimulated the growth and reduced the apoptosis of PMECs (all  < 0.05 or 0.01) and alleviated the TNF--induced cell injury. The expression of Claudin-5 and ZO-1 in Dex and all 3 CRT groups was markedly increased compared with TNF-a group (all  < 0.05 or 0.01).CRT effectively protects PMECs from TNF--induced injury, which might be mediated via stabilizing the structure of .

Rat diets were supplemented with α-lactalbumin replacing 50% of dietary protein. After consuming α-lactalbumin for one week, rats were intraperitoneally injected with TAA twice a week for 14 weeks. The α-lactalbumin-enriched diet significantly inhibited the elevation of plasma alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and hyaluronic . The supplement significantly reduced plasma lipopolysaccharide levels and increased occludin mRNA level. Hepatic fibrosis and regenerative nodules was developed and intestinal villi were shortened by TAA; α-Lactalbumin attenuated these histopathological changes. These results indicated that α-lactalbumin improved intestinal barrier function, suppressing endotoxin levels. These data also suggested that α-lactalbumin ameliorated the impairment of the gut-liver axis by TAA, inhibiting the development of liver cirrhosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939805>Enhanced Transepithelial Permeation of Gallic  and (-)-Epigallocatechin Gallate across Human Intestinal Caco-2 Cells Using Electrospun Xanthan Nanofibers.</a></h1><p>Electrospun xanthan polysaccharide nanofibers (X) were developed as an encapsulation and delivery system of the poorly absorbed polyphenol compounds, gallic  (GA) and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize the electrospun nanofibers, and controlled release studies were performed at pH 6.5 and 7.4 in saline buffer, suggesting that the release of polyphenols from xanthan nanofibers follows a non-Fickian mechanism. Furthermore, the X-GA and X-EGCG nanofibers were incubated with Caco-2 cells, and the cell viability, transepithelial transport, and permeability properties across cell monolayers were investigated. An increase of GA and EGCG permeability was observed when the polyphenols were loaded into xanthan nanofibers, compared to the free compounds. The observed in vitro permeability enhancement of GA and EGCG was induced by the presence of the polysaccharide nanofibers, which successfully inhibited efflux transporters, as well as by  opening.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826064>The stability of Magoh and Y14 depends on their heterodimer formation and nuclear localization.</a></h1><p>Reduced expression of the Y14 gene is a cause of Thrombocytopenia-absent radius (TAR) syndrome. This gene contains a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM) in the central region and nuclear localization/export sequences (NLS/NES) in the N-terminal. Y14 and Magoh proteins form  heterodimers and are the core of exon  complexes (EJCs), which mediate various processes of mRNA metabolism after transcription. In this report, we found that protein expression levels of exogenously expressed Magoh L136R and Y14 L118R (leucine-to-arginine substitution at amino  residue 136 and 118 respectively, that results in the formation of the complex being lost) are lower than their wild-types. This reduction is likely caused by protein levels, as no difference in mRNA levels was detected. Meanwhile, a cycloheximide chase assay determined that the degradation rates of Magoh L136R and Y14 L118R were faster than their wild-types. Both Y14 L118R and Magoh L136R lost the ability to form heterodimers with corresponding wild-type proteins. However, Y14 L118R is able to still localize in the nucleus which causes the stability of Y14 L118R to be higher than Magoh L136R. These results reveal that the stability of Magoh and Y14 is not only dependent on the heterodimer structure, but also dependent on nuclear localization.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Several methods have been used to replicate angiogenesis in vitro, including culturing vascular endothelial cells on Matrigel and coculturing with endothelial cells and fibroblasts. However, the angiogenesis elongation process has not been completely clarified in these models. We therefore propose a new in vitro model of angiogenesis, suitable for observing vascular elongation, by seeding a spheroid cocultured from endothelial cells and fibroblasts into a culture dish. In this model, endothelial cells formed tubular networks elongated from the spheroid with a lumen structure and were connected with . A basement membrane (BM)-like structure was observed around the tubular network, similarly to blood vessels in vivo. These results suggested that blood vessel-like structure could be reconstituted in our model. Laminin and type IV collagen, main BM components, were highly localized around the network, along with nontriple helical form of type IV collagen α1-chain [NTH α1(IV)]. In an ascorbic -depleted condition, laminin and NTH α1(IV) were observed around the network but not the triple-helical form of type IV collagen and the network was unstable. These results suggest that laminin and NTH α1(IV) are involved in the formation of tubular network and type IV collagen is necessary to stabilize the network.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31087706>Dietary probiotic form modulates broiler gut microbiota indices and expression of gut barrier genes including essential components for gut homeostasis.</a></h1><p>The probiotic form (PF) type and its dietary administration in combination or not with avilamycin (AV) were investigated for their effects on broiler gut microbiota and expression of genes relevant for gut barrier and gut homeostasis. Depending on PF type (i.e. no addition, viable, inactivated) and AV addition (no/yes), 450 one-day-old Cobb male broilers were allocated in 6 treatments (CON, CON + A, ViP, ViP + A, InP and InP + A) according to a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement with 5 replicates of 15 broilers each for 42 days. Significant interactions (P  ≤ 0.05) between PF and AV administration were shown for the ileal mucosa-associated bacteria, the caecal digesta Lactobacillus spp., the molar ratio of the sum of valeric, hexanoic and heptanoic  and the gene expressions of ileal and caecal IgA and ileal claudin 1. Avilamycin suppressed ileal digesta Lactobacillus spp. (P  < 0.001) and caecal digesta Clostridium perfringens subgroup (P  = 0.018) and modulated the intestinal fermentation intensity and pattern. The viable PF had the higher levels of ileal digesta Bacteroides spp. (P  = 0.021) and caecal digesta Lactobacillus spp. (P  = 0.038) compared with the other two PF. Probiotic form modulated the microbial metabolic activity in the ileum and caeca with the viable PF being the most noteworthy in terms of effects regarded as beneficial. Furthermore, the viable PF resulted in reduced expression of caecal Toll-like receptors TLR2B (P  = 0.026) and TLR4 (P  = 0.011) and transcription factor NFΚΒ1 (P  = 0.002), which could be considered as essential for limiting inflammation and preserving gut homeostasis. In conclusion, under non-challenge conditions, probiotic function was shown to depend on PF type and to a lesser degree on co-administration with AV. The importance of probiotic viability for the beneficial modulation of important gut components towards a reduced state of physiological inflammation has been highlighted.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853955>Wheat Fermentation With  QAUSD01 and  QAUWA03 Consortia Induces Concurrent Gliadin and Phytic  Degradation and Inhibits Gliadin Toxicity in Caco-2 Monolayers.</a></h1><p>Foods containing high amounts of either phytic  or gliadin can pose a risk for development of iron deficiency and celiac disease, respectively.

GEN1 dimerization has been suggested to play key role in the resolution of the HJ, but the kinetic details of its reaction remained elusive. Here, single-molecule FRET shows how human GEN1 binds the HJ and always ensures its resolution within the lifetime of the GEN1-HJ complex. GEN1 monomer generally follows the isomer bias of the HJ in its initial binding and subsequently distorts it for catalysis. GEN1 monomer remains tightly bound with no apparent dissociation until GEN1 dimer is formed and the HJ is fully resolved. Fast on- and slow off-rates of GEN1 dimer and its increased affinity to the singly-cleaved HJ enforce the forward reaction. Furthermore, GEN1 monomer binds singly-cleaved HJ tighter than intact HJ providing a fail-safe mechanism if GEN1 dimer or one of its monomers dissociates after the first cleavage. The  binding of GEN1 monomer to intact- and singly-cleaved HJ empowers it as the last resort to process HJs that escape the primary mechanisms.© The Author(s) 2018.

Although succinate is known to regulate intestinal metabolism and immune function, its role in the protection of the intestinal epithelial barrier function and inflammation is poorly characterized. In this study, we evaluated the effects of succinate on intestinal epithelial barrier function and inflammation in pigs. Twenty-four growing pigs were distributed into three groups ( = 8) and received either a basal diet (control group) or the same diet supplemented with 0.1% succinate or 1% succinate. The diet supplemented with 1% succinate led to alterations in the intestinal morphology. We confirmed in vitro that 5 mM succinate treatment modulated intestinal epithelial permeability by increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in intestinal porcine epithelial cell (IPEC)-J2 cells. Furthermore, succinate treatment increased the abundance of  proteins claudin-1, zona occluden (ZO)-1, and ZO-2 in the jejunum in vivo and in vitro. In addition, dietary succinate supplementation promoted the expression of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-25, IL-10, IL-8, and IL-18 in the jejunum. Taken together, these data identify a novel role of succinate in the modulation of intestinal epithelial barrier function, which may be a nutritional target to improve gut health in animals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31465827>Enhanced paracellular delivery of vaccine by hydrogel microparticles-mediated reversible  opening for effective oral immunization.</a></h1><p>The current conventional injectable vaccines face several drawbacks such as inconvenience and ineffectiveness in mucosal immunization. Therefore, the current development of effective oral vaccines is vital to enable the generation of dual systemic and mucosal immunity. In the present study, we examine the potential of pH-responsive bacterial nanocellulose/polyacrylic  (BNC/PAA) hydrogel microparticles (MPs) as an oral vaccine carrier. In-vitro entrapment efficiency and release study of Ovalbumin (Ova) demonstrated that as high as 72% of Ova were entrapped in the hydrogel, and the release of loaded Ova was pH-dependent. The released Ova remained structurally conserved as evident by Western blot and circular dichroism. Hydrogel MPs reduced the TEER measurement of HT29MTX/Caco2/Raji B triple co-culture monolayer by reversibly opening the  (TJs) as shown in the TEM images. The ligated ileal loop assay revealed that hydrogel MPs could facilitate the penetration of FITC-Ova into the Peyer's patches in small intestine. Ova and cholera toxin B (CTB) were utilized in in-vivo oral immunization as model antigen and mucosal adjuvant. The in-vivo immunization revealed mice orally administered with Ova and CTB-loaded hydrogel MPs generated significantly higher level of serum anti-Ova IgG and mucosal anti-Ova IgA in the intestinal washes, compared to intramuscular administrated Ova. These results conclude that BNC/PAA hydrogel MPs is a potential oral vaccine carrier for effective oral immunization.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Probiotics, including lactic  bacteria (LAB), have been repeatedly proven as an alternative approach for the treatment of various infections. We have analyzed the potential of  BGPAS1-3, a dairy isolate exhibiting strong direct antilisterial effect, to modulate the response of differentiated Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells to  ATCC 19111 infection. We showed that the molecule with antilisterial effect is a bacterial cell-wall protein that is highly resistant to the high-temperature treatment. When we tested the antilisterial potential of heat-killed BGPAS1-3, we found that it could prevent  disruption in differentiated Caco-2 monolayer infected with  ATCC 19111, induce antilisterial host response mechanisms, and stimulate the production of protective TGF-β in intestinal epithelial cells. We also showed that the modulation of MyD88 dependent TLR2 and TLR4 pathways by BGPAS1-3 are involved in host response against  ATCC 19111. Since heat-killed BGPAS1-3 possess strong antilisterial effects, such postbiotic could be used as a controllable and safe therapeutic.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30983357>Large-Scale Quantitative Comparison of Plasma Transmembrane Proteins between Two Human Blood-Brain Barrier Model Cell Lines, hCMEC/D3 and HBMEC/ciβ.</a></h1><p>Transmembrane (TM) proteins localized at the plasma membrane, such as transporters and receptors, play important roles in regulating the selective permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The purpose of the present study was to clarify the differences in the expression levels of TM proteins in the plasma membrane between two established human BBB model cell lines, hCMEC/D3 and HBMEC/ciβ, in order to assist researchers in selecting the most appropriate cell line for particular purposes. We first confirmed that plasma membranes could be enriched sufficiently for a quantitative proteomics study by using the Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit provided by BioVision with a modified protocol. This method was applied to hCMEC/D3 and HBMEC/ciβ cells, and fractions were used for untargeted quantitative proteomics based on sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment-ion spectra. In the plasma membrane fractions, 345 TM proteins were quantified, among which 135 showed significant expression differences between the two cell lines. In hCMEC/D3 cells, amino  transporters SNAT1, SNAT2, SNAT5, ASCT1, CAT1, and LAT1; adenosine 5'-triphosphate-binding cassette transporters P-gp and MRP4; and GLUT1 were more highly expressed. The transferrin receptor expression was also 4.56-fold greater in hCMEC/D3 cells. In contrast, HBMEC/ciβ cells expressed greater levels of IgG transporter neonatal Fc receptor, as well as  proteins PECAM1, JAM1, JAM3, and ESAM. Our results suggest that hCMEC/D3 cells have greater efflux transport, amino  transport, and transferrin receptor-mediated uptake activities, whereas HBMEC/ciβ cells have greater IgG-transport activity and  integrity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30910700>Deficiency of Stomach-Type Claudin-18 in Mice Induces Gastric Tumor Formation Independent of H pylori Infection.</a></h1><p>Epithelial cells are joined by  (TJs) to form a cell sheet. In the stomach, epithelial cell sheet forms an essential barrier against gastric material, including gastric . Although the decreased expression of stomach-type claudin-18 (stCldn18), a TJ protein, is generally observed in human gastritis and gastric cancer, its pathological roles are not fully understood. We previously reported that mice lacking stCldn18 (stCldn18-/-) exhibit gastric  leakage through TJs, which induces active gastritis at a young age. Here, we examined the gastric pathologies in mice after long-term stCldn18 deficiency.The gastric pathologies in stCldn18-/- mice were sequentially analyzed from youth to old age, and compared to those in humans. To examine the relationship between stCldn18 deficiency-induced gastric pathologies and Wnt-dependent tumorigenesis, we generated Wnt1-overexpressing stCldn18-/- mice.StCldn18-/- mice developed chronic active gastritis at middle age, with expression of the chemoattractant CCL28. At old age, 20-30% of these mice developed gastric tumors with CXCL5 expression, indicative of EMT. In this process, spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) cells appeared. Increased expressions of CD44-variants, TLR2, and CXCL5 indicated age-dependent changes in cell characteristics. Some features of the stCldn18-/- mouse gastric tumorigenesis resembled H pylori-infection-related human carcinogenesis. The gastric tumorigenesis was accelerated in Wnt1-overexpressing stCldn18-/- mice, indicating that Wnt is involved in the stCldn18-/- mouse gastric tumorigenesis.StCldn18 deficiency induced gastric tumorigenesis in mice without H pylori infection. Our findings revealed that several signaling networks, including the cytokine-, stemness-, and Wnt-signaling pathways, may be activated under the stCldn18-deficiency-induced chronic active gastritis to accelerate the gastric tumorigenesis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Three isonitrogenous and isolipidic experimental diets were formulated to contain 0 (FM), 40 (D.40) and 400 (D.400) mg kg daidzein, respectively. Fish fed D.400 had significantly lower growth performance than fish fed D.40. Dietary daidzein significantly increased the feed efficiency, while significantly decreased the feed intake. Daidzein supplementation increased the activity of total anti-oxidative capacity and the gene expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor-β1, Mucin-2 and  proteins (Tricellulin, Zonula occludens-1 transcript variant 1, Zonula occludens-1 transcript variant 2 and Claudin-like and Occludin), and down-regulated the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α in the intestine of turbot. Dietary daidzein increased intestinal microbial diversities, the abundance of several short chain fatty  producers, and decreased the abundance of some potential pathogenic bacteria. However, D.400 had dual effects on lactic  bacteria and increased the abundance of potential harmful bacterium Prevotella copri. Collectively, dietary daidzein at the levels of 40 and 400 mg kg could enhance the intestinal mucosal barrier function and alter the intestinal microbiota of turbot. However, high dose of daidzein must be treated with caution for its unclear effects on intestinal microbiota of turbot in the present study.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The VDR is activated by 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and plays an important role in maintaining integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier. LCA can also substitute for vitamin D to carry out the in vivo functions of vitamin D. However, it is unclear whether activation of the VDR by LCA affects mucosal barrier function. In the present study, we researched the protective effect of LCA on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction in Caco-2 cells of the human epithelial intestinal adenocarcinoma cell line. Caco-2 cell monolayers were pretreated with LCA and then exposed to 100 ng/mL TNF-α. The results showed that LCA alleviated the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in FITC-Dextran flux induced by TNF-α. LCA ameliorated the TNF-α-induced decrease in protein expression and distribution of ZO-1, E-cadherin, Occludin, and Claudin-1, which are  markers. Additionally, the LCA treatment effectively counteracted TNF-α-mediated downregulation of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1, which are related to oxidative stress. Increases in NF-κB p-p65 and p-IκB-α induced by TNF-α were significantly inhibited by LCA. Considering all these, the present study indicates that LCA has a significant protective effect on TNF-α-induced injury of intestinal barrier function through the VDR and suggests that suppressing NF-κB signaling and activating the SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway might be one of the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of LCA.Copyright © 2019.

We have recently reported that the paracellular route is the major urate transport pathway across the blood-placental barrier. In this study, the mechanism of urate paracellular transport was investigated in several epithelial cell lines including Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) type I, Lilly Laboratories cell-porcine kidney 1 (LLC-PK1) and Caco-2 cells. Very little urate passed through MDCK and LLC-PK1 cell layers. In contrast, one of the Caco-2 cell lines was found to be urate-permeable. This urate paracellular movement across Caco-2 cell layer was not inhibited by the urate transporter inhibitor benzbromarone but was partially inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyanato-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic  (DIDS), which inhibits chloride transport. Detection and quantification of claudin proteins that are important for paracellular transport of ions were performed by LC/MS. Claudins 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 12 were detected in urate-permeable cell lines, BeWo cells and Caco-2 cells. We compared claudin expression patterns in urate-permeable and urate-non-permeable Caco-2 cells by LC/MS and found that claudin 12 had a higher expression level in urate-permeable Caco-2 cells. Overexpression of these claudins in MDCK cells did not increase urate paracellular transport. Although there were differences in claudin expression pattern between urate-permeable and non-permeable cells, increased expression of single claudin alone did not explain paracellular permeability of urate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30483907>Glycine supplementation to breast-fed piglets attenuates post-weaning jejunal epithelial apoptosis: a functional role of CHOP signaling.</a></h1><p>This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that preweaning  glycine supplementation to breast-fed piglets alleviated the post-weaning  apoptosis of jejunal epithelium through CHOP signaling. Seven-day-old sow-reared piglets were orally administrated with 0, 50, 100, or 200% of glycine intake from sow's milk twice daily for 14 days and then were weaned at 21 days of age. Tissue samples were collected at 28 days of age for determining intestinal morphology, serum diamine oxidase (DAO) activity, abundances of proteins involved in ER stress and apoptosis. Glycine (100-200%) administration increased villus height, the ratio of villus height to crypt depth in the jejunum. Glycine supplementation (200%) enhanced average daily weight gain during the first 2 weeks post-weaning. Serum DAO activity and jejunal epithelium apoptosis were decreased, but the number of goblet cells in the jejunum was increased. Western blot analysis showed that 100-200% glycine enhanced the protein levels of occludin, claudin-1, and zonula occludens (ZO)-1 without affecting those of claudin-3, ZO-2, and ZO-3. Further studies showed that protein abundances of glucose-regulated protein 78 (BiP/GRP78) and p-IRE1α, instead of ATF6α, were reduced by glycine. Among the proteins related to apoptosis, abundances of CHOP and p53 were reduced, whereas those of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were enhanced in the jejunum of 100-200% glycine-supplemented piglets. Collectively, our results indicated that preweaning glycine supplementation improved the intestinal development of post-weaning piglets. The beneficial effect of glycine was associated with improved intestinal mucosal barrier and reduced apoptosis of enterocytes through CHOP signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30564756>Diet supplementation with an organic -based formulation affects gut microbiota and expression of gut barrier genes in broilers.</a></h1><p>This study was designed to study the effect of diet supplementation with an organic -based formulation (OABF) on luminal- and mucosa-associated bacteria, concentration of volatile fatty  (VFA), microbial glycolytic enzyme activity and expression of mucin 2 (), immunoglobulin A () and  protein, i.e., zonula occludens-1 (), zonula occludens-2 (), claudin-1 (), claudin-5 () and occludin (), genes at the ileal and cecal level. A 2 × 2 factorial design was used having OABF inclusion and avilamycin as main factors. Subsequently, 544 day-old male Cobb broilers were allocated in the following 4 treatments, each with 8 replicates: no additions (CON), 1 g OABF/kg diet (OA), 2.5 mg avilamycin/kg diet (AV) and combination of OA and AV (OAAV). The trial lasted for 42 days. In the ileum, OAAV resulted in lower mucosa-associated total bacteria levels (  = 0.028) compared with AV. In addition, ileal digesta levels of  subgroup were decreased by avilamycin (  = 0.045). Inclusion of OABF stimulated the activity of microbial glycolytic enzymes, whereas avilamycin resulted in lower acetate (  = 0.021) and higher butyrate (  = 0.010) molar ratios. Expression of  and  was down-regulated by both OABF (  = 0.016 and   = 0.003, respectively) and avilamycin (  = 0.016 and   = 0.001, respectively). In addition,  was down-regulated in AV compared with CON (  = 0.012). Furthermore, OABF down-regulated  (  = 0.027), whereas avilamycin down-regulated nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 () (  = 0.024), toll-like receptor 2 family member B () (  = 0.011) and toll-like receptor 4 () (  = 0.014) expression. In the ceca, OABF inclusion increased digesta levels of  (  = 0.018) and  (  = 0.040) subgroups, while it up-regulated  expression (  = 0.014). Avilamycin (  = 0.044) and interaction (  < 0.001) effects for  expression were noted, with CON having higher  expression compared with AV. In conclusion, new findings regarding OABF inclusion effects on an array of relevant biomarkers for broiler gut ecology have been reported and discussed in parallel with avilamycin effects used as a positive control.

SCFA are fermentation byproducts of the gut microbiota known to have many beneficial biological effects. We tested if a designer synbiotic could protect against ethanol-induced gut-liver injury. C57BL/6 female mice were exposed to chronic-binge ethanol feeding consisting of ethanol (5% vol/vol) for 10 days, followed by a single gavage (5 g/kg body weight) 6 h before euthanasia. A group of mice also received oral supplementation daily with a designer synbiotic, and another group received fecal slurry (FS); control animals received saline. Control mice were isocalorically substituted maltose dextran for ethanol over the entire exposure period. Ethanol exposure reduced expression of  proteins in the proximal colon and induced hepatocyte injury and steatosis. Synbiotic supplementation not only mitigated losses in  protein expression, but also prevented ethanol-induced steatosis and hepatocyte injury. Ethanol exposure also increased hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, which was also attenuated by synbiotic supplementation. Mice receiving FS were not protected from ethanol-induced liver injury or steatosis. Results were associated with luminal SCFA levels and SCFA transporter expression in the proximal colon and liver. These results indicate supplementation with a designer synbiotic is effective in attenuating chronic-binge ethanol-induced gut-liver injury and steatosis in mice, and highlight the beneficial effects of the gut microbial fermentation byproducts.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31280746>Review: nutritional and endocrine control of colostrogenesis in swine.</a></h1><p>Colostrum plays an essential role in ensuring the survival, growth and health of piglets by providing energy, nutrients, immunoglobulins, growth factors and many other bioactive components and cells. Both colostrum yield and composition are highly variable among sows, yet mechanisms and factors that regulate colostrogenesis are not fully known. Unlike sow milk yield, sow colostrum yield is not highly determined by litter size and suckling intensity but is largely driven by sow-related factors. Colostrum synthesis is under hormonal control, with prolactin and progesterone concentrations prepartum having, respectively, positive and negative influences on colostrum yield. Less is known about the endocrine control of the end of colostrogenesis in swine, which is characterized by the closure of  in the mammary epithelium and the cessation of transfer of immunoglobulin G (IgG) into lacteal secretions. Recent studies indicate that exogenous hormones may influence colostrogenesis. Inducing parturition by injecting prostaglandin F2α on day 114 of gestation in combination with an oxytocin-like molecule reduced colostrum yield, and injection of prostaglandin F2α alone either reduced colostrum yield or had no effect. Injecting a supraphysiological dose of oxytocin to sows in the early postpartum period delayed the tightening of mammary , thereby prolonging the colostral phase and increasing concentrations of IGF-I and IgG and IgA in early milk. The development of strategies to improve colostrum composition in swine through maternal feeding has been largely explored but very few attempts were made to increase colostrum yield. This is most likely because of the difficulty in measuring colostrum yield in swine. The fatty  content of colostrum greatly depends on the amount of lipids provided in the sow diet during late gestation, whereas the fatty  profile is largely influenced by the type of lipid being fed to the pregnant sow. Moreover, various ingredients that presumably have immuno-modulating effects (such as fish oil, prebiotics and probiotics) increased concentrations of IgG, IgA and/or IgM in sow colostrum when they were provided during the last weeks of gestation. Finally, there is some evidence that sow nutrition during late gestation may influence colostrum yield but this clearly warrants more research. This review emphasizes that although progress has been made in understanding the control of colostrogenesis in swine, and that strategies exist to manipulate fat and immunoglobulin contents of colostrum, ways to increase colostrum yield are still lacking.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31050722>Nrf2 Activator RS9 Suppresses Pathological Ocular Angiogenesis and Hyperpermeability.</a></h1><p>Ocular angiogenesis, including retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy, and exudative age-related macular degeneration, are closely related to oxidative stress. Many reports have shown that the cellular protective mechanism against oxidative stress and inflammatory response has nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and mechanism of Nrf2 activation in treating the ocular diseases with abnormal vessels.The effects of Nrf2 activators, bardoxolone methyl (BARD) and RS9, were evaluated against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced cell migration in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs). We measured the expression of the Nrf2 target genes, Ho-1 and Nqo-1 mRNA, in mouse retinas after a single injection of BARD and RS9. The effects and mechanisms of RS9 against retinal angiogenesis were evaluated using an oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model in mice. Moreover, the effect of RS9 against choroidal neovascularization (CNV) was evaluated in a laser-induced CNV monkey model.Both BARD and RS9 decreased VEGF-induced cell migration, and significantly increased Ho-1 mRNA expression; however, only RS9 significantly increased Nqo-1 mRNA. RS9 decreased retinal neovascularization through suppressing VEGF expression and increasing Nrf2, HO-1, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-β, and  proteins in OIR murine retinas. Furthermore, RS9 showed a tendency toward decreasing CNV lesions, and improved vascular leakage in a CNV monkey model.These data indicate that a Nrf2 activator might be a candidate for treatment of ocular diseases characterized by pathophysiological angiogenesis and hyperpermeability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161702>Effects of Lactococcus lactis MG1363 producing fusion proteins of bovine lactoferricin-lactoferrampin on growth, intestinal morphology and immune function in weaned piglet.</a></h1><p>We developed a strategy for localized delivery of the LFCA (lactoferricinlactoferrampin), which is actively synthesized in situ by Lactococcus lactis (pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363), and explored the possibility of using pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 as an alternative additive diet to antibiotics.The antimicrobial activities of the LFCA derived from pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 were tested in vitro. The results showed that LFCA had an inhibitory effect on Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis. Then, the pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 was used as an additive diet for piglets. Our data demonstrated that oral administration of pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 significantly improved the average daily gain, feed-to-gain ratio, intestinal mucosal integrity and decreased the serum endotoxin and d-lactic  levels. The mRNA expression levels of intestinal  proteins (including occludin, Claudin-1 and ZO-1) were significantly upregulated by pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 administration. The serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, intestinal secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) levels, IL-2, IL-10 and TGF-β levels were significantly increased by pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363. Furthermore, our data revealed that oral administration of pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 significantly increased the number of general Lactobacillus, and decreased the total viable E. coli counts in the ileum and cecum contents.We developed a novel pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 secreting LFCA, which had probiotic effects on the growth performance, intestinal morphology, intestinal barrier function and immunological indices of weaned piglets.pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363, with probiotic effects on the health of weaned piglets, may be a promising feed additive for weaned piglets.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31086953>Recent advances in intestinal alkaline phosphatase, inflammation, and nutrition.</a></h1><p>In recent years, much new data on intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) have been published, and major breakthroughs have been disclosed. The aim of the present review is to critically analyze the publications released over the last 5 years. These breakthroughs include, for example, the direct implication of IAP in intestinal  integrity and barrier function maintenance; chronic intestinal challenge with low concentrations of Salmonella generating long-lasting depletion of IAP and increased susceptibility to inflammation; the suggestion that genetic mutations in the IAP gene in humans contribute to some forms of chronic inflammatory diseases and loss of functional IAP along the gut and in stools; stool IAP as an early biomarker of incipient diabetes in humans; and omega-3 fatty  as direct inducers of IAP in intestinal tissue. Many recent papers have also explored the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of IAP and other alkaline phosphatase (AP) isoforms in various experimental settings and diseases. Remarkably, nearly all data confirm the potent anti-inflammatory properties of (I)AP and the negative consequences of its inhibition on health. A simplified model of the body AP system integrating the IAP compartment is provided. Finally, the list of nutrients and food components stimulating IAP has continued to grow, thus emphasizing nutrition as a potent lever for limiting inflammation.© The Author(s) 2019.

Of all OA cases, ~30% are thought to have a genetic origin, however, hitherto, the underlying genetic etiology of the majority of these cases remain unknown. To address this, we took a family-based whole-exome sequencing approach to identify causal variants of OA in a multiplex family with epidydimal obstruction. A novel gain-of-function missense variant in CLDN2 (c.481G>C; p.Gly161Arg) was found to co-segregate with the phenotype, consistent with the X-linked inheritance pattern observed in the pedigree. To assess the pathogenicity of this variant, the wild and mutant protein structures were modeled and their potential for strand formation in multimeric form was assessed and compared. The results showed that dimeric and tetrameric arrangements of Claudin-2 were not only reduced, but were also significantly altered by this single residue change. We, therefore, envisage that this amino  change likely forms a polymeric discontinuous strand, which may lead to the disruption of  among epithelial cells. This missense variant is thus likely to be responsible for the disruption of the blood-epididymis barrier, causing dislodged epithelial cells to clog the genital tract, hence causing OA. This study not only sheds light on the underlying pathobiology of OA, but also provides a basis for more efficient diagnosis in the clinical setting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30760383> sphingomyelinase-mediated blood-brain barrier disruption in aging.</a></h1><p>Although many studies have reported that the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) represents one of the major pathological changes in aging, the mechanism underlying this process remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we described that  sphingomyelinase (ASM) derived from endothelial cells plays a critical role in BBB disruption in aging. ASM levels were elevated in the brain endothelium and plasma of aged humans and mice, resulting in BBB leakage through an increase in caveolae-mediated transcytosis. Moreover, ASM caused damage to the caveolae-cytoskeleton via protein phosphatase 1-mediated ezrin/radixin/moesin dephosphorylation in primary mouse brain endothelial cells. Mice overexpressing brain endothelial cell-specific ASM exhibited acceleration of BBB impairment and neuronal dysfunction. However, genetic inhibition and endothelial specific knock-down of ASM in mice improved BBB disruption and neurocognitive impairment during aging. Results of this study revealed a novel role of ASM in the regulation of BBB integrity and neuronal function in aging, thus highlighting the potential of ASM as a new therapeutic target for anti-aging.

Characterizing C. difficile isolated from canines is important for understanding the role that canines may play in CAI. In addition, several studies have suggested that canines carry toxigenic C. difficile asymptomatically, which may imply that there are mechanisms responsible for resistance to CDI in canines that could be exploited to help combat human CDI. To assess the virulence potential of canine-derived C. difficile, we tested whether toxins TcdA and TcdB (hereafter toxins) derived from a canine isolate were capable of causing  disruptions to colonic epithelial cells. Additionally, we addressed whether major differences exist between human and canine cells regarding C. difficile pathogenicity by exposing them to identical toxins. We then examined the canine gut microbiome associated with C. difficile carriage using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and searched for deviations from homeostasis as an indicator of CDI. Finally, we queried 16S rRNA gene sequences for bacterial taxa that may be associated with resistance to CDI in canines. Clostridioides difficile isolated from a canine produced toxins that reduced  integrity in both human and canine cells in vitro. However, canine guts were not dysbiotic in the presence of C. difficile. These findings support asymptomatic carriage in canines and, furthermore, suggest that there are features of the gut microbiome and/or a canine-specific immune response that may protect canines against CDI. We identified two biologically relevant bacteria that may aid in CDI resistance in canines: 1) Clostridium hiranonis, which synthesizes secondary bile  that have been shown to provide resistance to CDI in mice; and 2) Sphingobacterium faecium, which produces sphingophospholipids that may be associated with regulating homeostasis in the canine gut. Our findings suggest that canines may be cryptic reservoirs for C. difficile and, furthermore, that mechanisms of CDI resistance in the canine gut could provide insights into targeted therapeutics for human CDI.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

ATRA is widely used in the treatment of skin diseases, but results in irritation, dryness and peeling, possibly due to an impaired skin barrier, although the exact mechanisms are unclear. The present study established an ATRA‑associated dermatitis mouse model (n=32) in order to examine the molecular mechanisms of skin barrier impairment by ATRA. Changes in epidermal morphology and structure were observed using histological examination and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Gene expression was analyzed by microarray chip assay. Histology and TEM demonstrated pronounced epidermal hyperproliferation and parakeratosis upon ATRA application. The stratum corneum layer displayed abnormal lipid droplets and cell‑cell , suggesting alterations in lipid metabolism and dysfunctional cell . Gene expression profiling revealed that factors associated with epidermal barrier function were differentially expressed by ATRA, including those associated with  (TJs), cornified envelopes, lipids, proteases, protease inhibitors and transcription factors. In the mouse epidermis, Claudin‑1 and ‑4 are proteins involved in TJs and have key roles in epidermal barrier function. ATRA reduced the expression and altered the localization of Claudin‑1 in HaCaT immortalized keratinocytes and the mouse epidermis, which likely leads to the disruption of the epidermal barrier. By contrast, Claudin‑4 was upregulated in HaCaT cells and the mouse epidermis following treatment with ATRA. In conclusion, ATRA exerts a dual effect on epidermal barrier genes: It downregulates the expression of Claudin‑1 and upregulates the expression of Claudin‑4. Claudin‑4 upregulation may be a compensatory response for the disrupted barrier function caused by Claudin‑1 downregulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570003>The comprehensive pathophysiological changes in a novel rat model of postinflammatory visceral hypersensitivity.</a></h1><p>So far, a comprehensive animal model that can mimic both the central and peripheral pathophysiological changes of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is lacking. Here, we developed a novel IBS rat model combining trinitro-benzene-sulfonic  (TNBS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) (designated as TC-IBS) and compared it with the TNBS-induced and CUMS-induced models. TC-IBS showed a pronounced depression phenotype with increased corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor (CRHR)1 and CRHR2 expression at the frontal cortex and increased serum ACTH concentration. Visceral hypersensitivity (VH), as evidenced by colorectal distention (CRD) test, was highest in TC-IBS, accompanied by increased serum 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) level and colonic 5-HT receptor 3A (5-HTR)/5-HT receptor 2B expression, impaired  protein expression including occludin, zonula occludens-1, and phosphorylated myosin light chain. Palonosetron, a second generation of 5-HTR antagonist, alleviated VH significantly in TC-IBS. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that TNBS plus CUMS induced a significant disturbance of the gut microbiota. Cytokine profile analysis of TC-IBS model indicated an innate immune activation both in serum and colonic mucosa. Further, fecal microbiota transplantation improved VH and some pathophysiological changes in TC-IBS. In summary, we established a postinflammatory IBS model covering multifactorial pathophysiological changes, which may help to develop therapies that target specific IBS subtype.-Ma, J., Li, J., Qian, M., He, N., Cao, Y., Liu, Y., Wu, K., He, S.

The rat ALI model was reproduced by injection of 0.01 mL/kg oleic  into the tail vein, and the rats in NS control group were injected with the same amount of NS. The rats in KGF-2 pretreatment group were instilled with 5 mg/kg KGF-2 in the airway at 72 hours before the model reproduction, and the rats in the NS control group and the ALI model group were instilled with the same amount of NS. The abdominal aortic blood of rats was collected at 8 hours after model reproduction, and then the rats were sacrificed, bronchoalveolar in left lung was lavage, and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected for determination of protein levels in plasma and BALF, and the lung permeability index (LPI) was calculated. The lung tissues were harvested, after hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, the histopathological changes were observed under light microscope, and the ALI pathology score (LIS) was calculated. The lung wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio was determined. Immunohistochemistry and Western Blot were used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the expressions of FKN and claudin-5 in the lung tissue. The correlation between two variables was analyzed by linear or curve fitting correlation analysis.In the ALI model group, the lung tissue was severely damaged, and obvious pathological changes were observed, including thickened alveolar space and inflammatory cell infiltration, and LIS score, lung W/D ratio and LPI were significantly higher than those of the NS control group (LIS: 3.56±0.28 vs. 0.62±0.36, lung W/D ratio: 6.37±0.29 vs. 4.39±0.33, LPI: 3.46±0.69 vs. 0.98±0.17, all P < 0.01). Compared with the NS control group, the positive expression of FKN in the lung tissue of the ALI model group was significantly increased, and the expression level was significantly increased (FKN/GAPDH: 0.97±0.18 vs. 0.62±0.04, P < 0.01); the positive expression of claudin-5 was significantly decreased, and the expression level was significantly decreased (claudin-5/GAPDH: 0.56±0.11 vs. 1.06±0.13, P < 0.01). There was a significant negative correlation between FKN and claudin-5 protein expression (r = -0.817, P = 0.025). After pretreatment with KGF-2, the degree of lung tissue damage was significantly reduced, and the pathological changes were significantly improved, and the LIS score, lung W/D ratio and LPI were significantly lower than those of the ALI model group (LIS: 2.41±0.17 vs. 3.56±0.28, lung W/D ratio: 5.45±0.55 vs. 6.37±0.29, LPI: 2.42±0.19 vs. 3.46±0.69, all P < 0.01). Compared with the ALI model group, the positive expression of FKN in the lung tissue of KGF-2 pretreatment group was significantly decreased, and the expression level was significantly decreased (FKN/GAPDH: 0.79±0.03 vs. 0.97±0.18, P < 0.01); the positive expression of claudin-5 was significantly increased, and the expression level was significantly increased (claudin-5/GAPDH: 0.80±0.05 vs. 0.56±0.11, P < 0.01). There was still a significant negative correlation between FKN and claudin-5 protein expression (r = -0.847, P = 0.012).KGF-2 may restore the expression of  protein claudin-5 by down-regulating the expression of chemokine FKN, thereby reducing the damage of blood barrier in ALI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31166332>Improving photoelectrochemical response of ZnO nanowire arrays by coating with p-type ZnO-resembling metal-organic framework.</a></h1><p>Coupling semiconducting metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with metal oxide (MO) semiconductor nanowires is an efficient solution to tune the photoelectric properties of both the parties. In this report, we demonstrate a facile surfactant-free growth strategy for modification of zinc oxide (ZnO) single-crystal nanowire arrays (NWAs) with the MOF zinc glycolate (noted as Zn-GA) that contains an embedded continuous 3D Zn-O network. Due to the structural resemblance of the Zn-O network between Zn-GA and ZnO, the prepared ZnO@Zn-GA nanowires present a  contact at the core-shell interface in a partially epitaxial manner, and the loading amount of Zn-GA can be well controlled in the synthetic process. The inherent p-type Zn-GA in combination with the widely available n-type ZnO assures the construction of tandem n-p heterojunctions at the core-shell interface, which is confirmed by Mott-Schottky analysis. By implementation of the ZnO@Zn-GA NWAs as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical oxidation of water and oxalic , improved photocurrent responses are obtained relative to the primary ZnO NWAs. The most significant photoresponse is observed in the ZnO nanowires shelled by a compact Zn-GA particulate thin film with the largest  region. These results are elucidated by the enhanced spatial separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers, which is favored by the built-in electric field at the interface of the n-p heterojunctions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30562511>To BBB or Not to BBB?</a></h1><p>In this issue of Developmental Cell, Anbalagan et al. demonstrate that pituicytes, a subtype of astroglia, drive endothelial cell permeability in the zebrafish embryo neurohypophysis.

Thus, the current study investigates the effect of constipation symptoms on gut functionality following the modulation of gut microbiota and metabolites via dietary fiber intervention.Constipation causes a significantly reduced short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) production and a higher level of iso-butyrate. The feces of constipated people are characterized with inhibited Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcaceae and Roseburia abundance. Desulfovibrionaceae is identified to be an important endotoxin producer in constipated patients, and a butyrate-enriched SCFAs profile achieved by dietary fiber supplement accelerates gastrointestinal transit and increases the thickness of the mucosal layer, possibly through triggering the secretion of colonic hormones and enhancing the expression of  proteins for maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. More importantly, an interacting regulatory mechanism among SCFAs, in particular butyrate and propionate, may be involved in signaling between the microbiome and host cells in the colon.Gut microbiota, characterized with enriched butyrate-producing and depressed Desulfovibrionaceae bacteria, attenuates constipation symptoms through promoting intestinal hormones secretion and maintaining gut barrier integrity.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The etiology of colitis cases can be manifold, and diet can significantly affect onset and outcome of colitis. While many forms of acute colitis are easily treatable, chronic forms of colitis such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (summarized as inflammatory bowel diseases) are multifactorial with poorly understood pathogenesis. Inflammatory bowel diseases are characterized by exacerbated immune responses causing epithelial dysfunction and bacterial translocation. There is no cure and therapies aim at reducing inflammation and restoring intestinal barrier function. Unfortunately, most drugs can have severe side effects. Changes in diet and inclusion of nutritional supplements have been extensively studied in cell culture and animal models, and some supplements have shown promising results in clinical studies. Most of these nutritional supplements including vitamins, fatty  and phytochemicals reduce oxidative stress and inflammation and have shown beneficial effects during experimental colitis in rodents induced by dextran sulphate sodium or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic , which remain the gold standard in pre-clinical colitis research. Here, we summarize the mechanisms through which such nutritional supplements contribute to epithelial barrier stabilization.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625033>Role of JAM-A tyrosine phosphorylation in epithelial barrier dysfunction during intestinal inflammation.</a></h1><p>Junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A), an epithelial  protein, plays an important role in regulating intestinal permeability through association with a scaffold signaling complex containing ZO-2, Afadin, and the small GTPase Rap2. Under inflammatory conditions, we report that the cytoplasmic tail of JAM-A is tyrosine phosphorylated (p-Y280) in association with loss of barrier function. While barely detectable Y280 phosphorylation was observed in confluent monolayers of human intestinal epithelial cells under basal conditions, exposure to cytokines TNFα, IFNγ, IL-22, or IL-17A, resulted in compromised barrier function in parallel with increased p-Y280. Phosphorylation was Src kinase dependent, and we identified Yes-1 and PTPN13 as a major kinase and phosphatase for p-JAM-A Y280, respectively. Moreover, cytokines IL-22 or IL-17A induced increased activity of Yes-1. Furthermore, the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 rescued cytokine-induced epithelial barrier defects and inhibited phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 in vitro. Phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 and increased permeability correlated with reduced JAM-A association with active Rap2. Finally, we observed increased phosphorylation of Y280 in colonic epithelium of individuals with ulcerative colitis and in mice with experimentally induced colitis. These findings support a novel mechanism by which tyrosine phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 regulates epithelial barrier function during inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31432190>Impaired intestinal barrier function in a mouse model of hyperuricemia.</a></h1><p>Previous studies have demonstrated the effects of hyperuricemia on the damage to target organs, including the kidneys, joints and the heart. However, it is unclear whether hyperuricemia results in damage to the intestines. The aim of the present study was to investigate intestinal barrier dysfunction in a mouse model of hyperuricemia constructed by knocking out the urate oxidase (Uox) gene. The morphology of the intestine was assessed via hematoxylin and eosin, and alcian blue staining. The serum and intestinal tissue levels of uric , tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α and interleukin (IL)‑6, in addition to the presence of uremic toxins in the serum, were assessed. The levels of diamine oxidase (DAO), D‑lactate (D‑LAC) and endotoxins in the serum, which are markers of the intestinal permeability, were measured using ELISA. The expression of the intestinal  proteins zona occludens‑1 (ZO‑1) and occludin were detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis. The Uox‑knockout mice spontaneously developed hyperuricemia. Histopathological analysis indicated notable intestinal defects including sparse villi, mucosal edema and a declining mucus layer in hyperuricemic mice. The expression levels of ZO‑1 and occludin in the intestines were downregulated, and the serum levels of DAO, D‑LAC and endotoxins were higher in the hyperuricemic mice, compared with control mice. The serum and intestinal tissue levels of IL‑6 and TNF‑α were significantly increased. Additionally, the expression levels of the serum uremic toxins, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen were significantly increased in hyperuricemic mice compared with the control mice, while only a marked increase in indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p‑cresol sulfate was reported. Collectively, the results of the present study suggested that intestinal barrier dysfunction and subsequent enhanced intestinal permeability may occur as a result of hyperuricemia in mice. Furthermore, we proposed that the loss of intestinal epithelium barrier function may be associated with uric ‑induced inflammatory responses; however, further investigation is required.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498347>The synergistic effect of Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM242 and zinc on ulcerative colitis through modulating intestinal homeostasis.</a></h1><p>The beneficial effects of the essential metal zinc (Zn) and probiotics on gut health have been well documented, but how they synergistically affect intestinal physiology is not thoroughly understood. In this study, the Zn-enriching ability of 33 probiotics in a medium or an aqueous solution was evaluated. A Lactobacillus plantarum strain, CCFM242, with a superior Zn-enriching ability was screened. Among the cellular components, the cell wall played the most important role in the Zn binding of L. plantarum CCFM242. The carboxyl and amino groups on the surface of the strain were also vital for Zn enrichment. Upon optimization of the Zn-enriching procedure, the Zn-binding ability of this strain reached 24.89 ± 0.50 mg g dry biomass. Compared to the treatment of ZnSO or L. plantarum CCFM242, oral supplementation with Zn-enriched L. plantarum CCFM242 resulted in a higher serum Zn level, enhanced levels of mRNA expression of colonic , increased levels of short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) in colonic contents, and stronger modulatory effects on the anti-oxidant and immune defense systems in the gut of normal mice. Zn-Enriched L. plantarum CCFM242 treatment also offered more significant protective effects against dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice compared to the treatment of ZnSO or L. plantarum CCFM242 alone. The synergistic effect of Zn-enriched L. plantarum CCFM242 may be due to the increased tolerance of the strain to the gastrointestinal tract conditions and the higher bioavailability of Zn after the metal-enrichment process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30576809>Characterization of two novel mutations in the claudin-16 and claudin-19 genes that cause familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis.</a></h1><p>Familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis is an autosomal-recessive renal tubular disorder characterized by excessive urinary losses of magnesium and calcium, bilateral nephrocalcinosis and progressive chronic renal failure in childhood or adolescence. The disease is caused by mutations in the  proteins claudin-16 and claudin-19 that are encoded by the CLDN16 and CLDN19 genes, respectively. Patients with CLDN19 mutations also are affected with severe ocular abnormalities. The aim of our study was to identify and characterize the molecular defects causing this disease in a Georgian girl and two Spanish siblings. Clinical and biochemical parameters were studied. The CLDN16 and CLDN19 genes were analyzed by DNA sequencing. The functional consequences of the identified mutations on pre-mRNA splicing were investigated using a minigene assay. Sequence analysis revealed that the patient from Georgia was homozygous for a novel mutation, c.602G > A; p.(G201E), in exon 4 of the CLDN16 gene. The two Spanish siblings were homozygous for a new CLDN19 mutation, c.388G > T; p.(G130C), located in exon 2, and both parents were heterozygous carriers of the mutation. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that the amino  substitutions generated by these mutations were pathogenic. Functional studies showed that mutation c.388G > T also results in partial skipping of CLDN19 exon 2, which would imply significant alterations in the claudin-19 protein structure. Conversely, CLDN16 mutation c.602G > A had no effect on pre-mRNA splicing. Our study expands the genotypic classification of this rare disease and provides the first report of a CLDN19 mutation affecting splicing.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Salvianic  A sodium (SAAS) is an active compound derived from the well-known herbal medicine Danshen, which has been widely used for clinical treatment of cardiovascular diseases in China. This study aimed to confirm the cardioprotective effects of SAAS in rats with myocardial infarction and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms based on proteome and transcriptome profiling of myocardial tissue. The results showed that SAAS effectively protected against myocardial injury and improved cardiac function. The differentially expressed proteins and genes included important structural molecules, receptors, transcription factors, and cofactors. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that SAAS participated in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton, phagosome, focal adhesion, , apoptosis, MAPK signaling, and Wnt signaling pathways, which are closely related to cardiovascular diseases. SAAS may exert its cardioprotective effect by targeting multiple pathways at both the proteome and transcriptome levels.

To investigate whether cow's genetic background might contribute to cheese volatilome, we carried out genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and pathway-based analyses for 173 spectrometric peaks tentatively associated with several VOCs obtained from proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) analyses of 1,075 model cheeses produced using raw whole-milk from Brown Swiss cows. Overall, we detected 186 SNPs associated with 120 traits, several of which mapped close to genes involved in protein (e.g. CSN3, GNRHR and FAM169A), fat (e.g. AGPAT3, SCD5, and GPAM) and carbohydrate (e.g. B3GNT2, B4GALT1, and PHKB) metabolism. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that pathways connected with proteolysis/amino  metabolism (purine and nitrogen metabolism) as well as fat metabolism (long-term potentiation) and mammary gland function () were overrepresented. Our results provide the first evidence of a putative link between cow's genes and cheese flavour and offer new insights into the role of potential candidate loci and the biological functions contributing to the cheese volatilome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471875>A Method to Prepare Claudin-Modulating Recombinant Proteins.</a></h1><p>The epithelium forms  by sealing the paracellular space, and  prevent the free movement of solutes.

Irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity was measured using the irritable bowel syndrome-symptom severity scale.Patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome had higher zonulin levels compared with healthy controls ( = 0.006 and 0.009 respectively), which was comparable to those with active celiac disease. Although zonulin levels did not correlate with the overall irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity scale, it positively correlated with stool frequency per week ( = 0.03) and dissatisfaction with bowel habits ( = 0.007) in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome had lower intestinal fatty  binding protein levels compared with celiac patients ( = 0.005 and  = 0.047 respectively).Serum zonulin is upregulated in irritable bowel syndrome and the levels are comparable to those in celiac disease.

Orally provided hyaluronan with an average molecular weight of 35 kDa (HA35) protects mice from short-term ethanol (EtOH)-induced liver injury. This protection was associated with maintenance of the colocalization of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin at  in the proximal colon. However, it is not known whether HA35 also protects other regions of the intestine or whether protection is due to a direct and/or indirect interaction of HA35 with the intestinal epithelium.Female C57BL/6J mice were fed an EtOH containing diet or pair-fed control diet (4 days) and treated with or without HA35 via daily gavage during the last 3 days of EtOH feeding. Intestinal morphology and  integrity were assessed. Differentiated Caco-2 cells were transfected or not with scrambled siRNA or siRNA targeting layilin, a hyaluronan receptor. Caco-2 cells were treated with or without HA35 prior to challenge with EtOH. Localization of  proteins, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran permeability, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) were evaluated.While short-term EtOH did not result in any apparent changes in the gross morphology of the intestine, colocalization of ZO-1 and occludin at  was decreased in the proximal and distal colon. HA35 prevented these effects of EtOH. In differentiated Caco-2 cells, EtOH decreased the localization of ZO-1 and occludin at  and increased permeability of FITC-dextran. At higher concentrations, EtOH also decreased TEER. Pretreatment with HA35 prevented these changes. When the hyaluronan receptor layilin was knocked down in Caco-2 cells, HA35 no longer protected cells from EtOH-induced loss of .Taken together, these data indicate that HA35 interacts with layilin on intestinal epithelial cells and maintains intestinal  integrity during short-term EtOH exposure.© 2019 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141995>Cecal Infusion of Sodium Propionate Promotes Intestinal Development and Jejunal Barrier Function in Growing Pigs.</a></h1><p>Short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) produced by microbial fermentation facilitate the differentiation and proliferation of intestinal epithelium.

Some caliciviruses are known to use either terminal sialic  or histo-blood group antigens as attachment factors and/or cell surface proteins, such as CD300lf, CD300ld, and junctional adhesion molecule 1 of  (TJs), as receptors. However, the roles of TJs and their proteins in sapovirus entry have not been examined. In this study, we found that porcine sapovirus (PSaV) significantly decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and increased paracellular permeability early in infection of LLC-PK cells, suggesting that PSaV dissociates TJs of cells. This led to the interaction between PSaV particles and occludin, which traveled in a complex into late endosomes via Rab5- and Rab7-dependent trafficking. Inhibition of occludin using small interfering RNA (siRNA), a specific antibody, or a dominant-negative mutant significantly blocked the entry of PSaV. Transient expression of occludin in nonpermissive Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells conferred susceptibility to PSaV, but only for a limited time. Although claudin-1, another TJ protein, neither directly interacted nor was internalized with PSaV particles, it facilitated PSaV entry and replication in the LLC-PK cells. We conclude that PSaV particles enter LLC-PK cells by binding to occludin as a coreceptor in PSaV-dissociated TJs. PSaV and occludin then form a complex that moves to late endosomes via Rab5- and Rab7-dependent trafficking. In addition, claudin-1 in the TJs opened by PSaV infection facilitates PSaV entry and infection as an entry factor. Sapoviruses (SaVs) cause severe acute gastroenteritis in humans and animals. Although they replicate in intestinal epithelial cells, which are tightly sealed by apical-junctional complexes, such as  (TJs), the mechanisms by which SaVs hijack TJs and their proteins for successful entry and infection remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that porcine SaVs (PSaVs) induce early dissociation of TJs, allowing them to bind to the TJ protein occludin as a functional coreceptor. PSaVs then travel in a complex with occludin into late endosomes through Rab5- and Rab7-dependent trafficking. Claudin-1, another TJ protein, does not directly interact with PSaV but facilitates the entry of PSaV into cells as an entry factor. This work contributes to our understanding of the entry of SaV and other caliciviruses into cells and may aid in the development of efficient and affordable drugs to treat SaV infections.Copyright © 2019 Alfajaro et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30789669>Dietary leonurine hydrochloride supplementation attenuates lipopolysaccharide challenge-induced intestinal inflammation and barrier dysfunction by inhibiting the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway in broilers.</a></h1><p>This study was performed to evaluate the beneficial effects of dietary leonurine hydrochloride (LH) supplementation on intestinal morphology and barrier integrity and further illuminate its underlying antioxidant and immunomodulatory mechanisms in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated broilers.

Compared with the control group, LPS-challenged broilers showed impaired growth performance (P < 0.05) from day 15 to day 21 of the trial, increased serum diamine oxidase (DAO) and D-lactic  (D-LA) levels coupled with reduced glutathione (GSH) content and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity (duodenal and jejunal mucosa), reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content (duodenal, jejunal, and ileal mucosa), and compromised morphological structure of the duodenum and jejunum. Additionally, LPS challenge increased (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes and reduced  (TJ) protein expression in the jejunum. However, dietary LH prevented LPS-induced reductions in average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) in broilers. It also alleviated LPS challenge-induced increases in serum DAO levels, MDA content (duodenal and jejunal mucosa), and jejunal crypt depth (P < 0.05) but reduced villus height, GSH content (jejunal mucosa), and T-SOD activity (duodenal and jejunal mucosa) (P < 0.05). Additionally, LH supplementation significantly downregulated the mRNA expression of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and upregulated the mRNA expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and Occludin in the jejunal mucosa induced by LPS (P < 0.05). On the other hand, LH administration prevented LPS-induced activation of the p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and attenuated IkB alpha (IκBα) phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (p65) in the jejunal mucosa. In conclusion, dietary LH supplementation attenuates intestinal mucosal disruption mainly by accelerating the expression of TJ proteins and inhibiting activation of the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway.© The Author(s) 2019.

Results exhibited, besides changing the intestinal physiological status, orally administrated GXG could improve the intestinal physical barrier function by modulating mucosal structures and up-regulating the expression of  proteins, reinforce the intestinal biochemical barrier function by elevating the expression and secretion of mucin-2, β-defensins and sIgA, and regulate the intestinal immunological barrier function by stimulating the production of cytokines and the functional development of immune cells. Simultaneously, GXG could differentially impact the composition and metabolism of microbiota along intestinal tract. In addition, the immune response in spleen and peripheral blood were effectively regulated by GXG. These results indicated that GXG might be used as functional agent to improve host health.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it remains unknown whether and how exosomes mediate the release of NOD-like receptor pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome products such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) from endothelial cells. The present study hypothesized that lysosomal  ceramidase (AC) determines the fate of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) to control the exosome-mediated release of NLRP3 inflammasome products during hyperglycemia. Using a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mouse model, we found that endothelium-specific AC gene knockout mice (Asah1/EC) significantly enhanced the formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in coronary arterial ECs (CECs). These mice also had increased thickening of the coronary arterial wall and reduced expression of  protein compared to wild-type (WT/WT) littermates. We also observed the expression of exosome markers such as CD63 and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was augmented in STZ-treated Asah1/EC mice compared to WT/WT mice, which was accompanied by an increased IL-1β release of exosomes. In the primary cultures of CECs, we demonstrated that AC deficiency markedly enhanced the formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, but significantly down-regulated  proteins when these cells were exposed to high levels of glucose. The CECs from Asah1/EC mice had decreased MVB-lysosome interaction and increased IL-1β-containing exosome release in response to high glucose stimulation. Together, these results suggest that AC importantly controls exosome-mediated release of NLRP3 inflammasome products in CECs, which is enhanced by AC deficiency leading to aggravated arterial inflammatory response during hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Taking into account the beneficial health-promoting effects of GABA, the presence of the  gene, encoding glutamate decarboxylase that converts L-glutamate to GABA, was analyzed in Lactic  Bacteria (LAB) natural isolates from Zlatar cheese. The results revealed that 52% of tested  spp. and 8% of  spp. isolates harbor the  gene. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of GABA production performed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed the highest GABA production by  BGZLS10-17. Since high GABA-producing LAB natural isolates are the most valuable source of naturally produced GABA, the probiotic properties of BGZLS10-17 were characterized. This study demonstrated high adhesion of BGZLS10-17 strain to Caco-2 cells and the ability to decrease the adhesion of  ATCC25922 and  C29039. Treatment of differentiated Caco-2 cells monolayer with BGZLS10-17 supernatant containing GABA alleviated inflammation (production of IL-8) caused by IL-1β and significantly stimulated the expression of  proteins (zonulin, occludin, and claudin 4), as well as the expression of  cytokine leading to the conclusion that immunosuppression and strengthening the  can have significant role in the maintenance of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. Taken together the results obtained in this study support the idea that using of GABA producing BGZLS10-17 probiotic strain could be a good strategy to modulate immunological response in various inflammatory diseases, and at the same time, it could be a good candidate for adjunct starter culture for production of GABA-enriched dairy foods and beverages offering new perspectives in designing the novel functional foods.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31025998>Dietary xylo-oligosaccharide improves intestinal functions in weaned piglets.</a></h1><p>This study aimed at investigating the effects of dietary xylo-oligosaccharide (XOS) on intestinal functions (i.e., intestinal morphology, , gut microbiota and metabolism) and growth performance in weaned piglets. 19 weaned piglets were randomly divided into two groups (n = 9/10): a control group (basic diet) and a XOS treated group in which piglets were fed 0.01% XOS for 28 days. Growth performance, blood cells and biochemical parameters, serum cytokines, intestinal morphology, , gut microbiota, and the metabolic profiles of the gut digesta were analyzed. The results showed that dietary supplementation with XOS had little effects on growth performance, blood cells and biochemical parameters, and intestinal morphology. However, the inflammatory status and intestinal barrier were improved in XOS-fed piglets evidenced by the reduction of IFN-γ and upregulation of ZO-1. Microbiota analysis showed that XOS enhanced α-diversity and affected the relative abundances of Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Turicibacter at the genus level. The alterations in the microbiota might be further involved in carbohydrate metabolism, cell motility, cellular processes and signaling, lipid metabolism, and metabolism of other amino  by functional prediction. A metabolomics study identified three differentiated metabolites, including coenzyme Q6, zizyphine A, and pentadecanal, which might be produced by the microbiota and further affect host metabolism. In conclusion, dietary XOS improved the inflammatory status, gut barrier, and microbiota communities, which might be used as a potential feed additive to prevent gut dysfunction caused by weaning in the pig industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302421>Herbs-partitioned moxibustion improves intestinal epithelial  by upregulating A20 expression in a mouse model of Crohn's disease.</a></h1><p>To investigate effects moxibustion exerts on A20 expression and regulation of intestinal epithelial  via the TNF-α-NF-κB-MLCK pathway in Crohn's disease (CD).C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and A20 mice (48 each) were randomly divided into normal control (NC), model control (MC), mesalazine (MESA) and herbs-partitioned moxibustion (HPM) groups (12 mice per group). An experimental model of CD was established using 2, 4, 6 trinitrobenzene sulfonic . MESA and HPM mice were treated with MESA and HPM (at Tianshu (ST25) and Qihai (CV6)), respectively. In HPM group, moxa cones (0.5 cm in diameter and 0.3 cm in height) made of refined mugwort floss were placed on herbal cakes (medicinal formula dispensing [radix] Aconiti praeparata, [cortex] Cinnamomi, etc.) at Tianshu (ST25) and Qihai (CV6) and ignited. The moxa cones were ignited, and two moxa cones were used for each treatment once daily for 10 days. In MESA group, mice were fed MESA, which was prepared at a proportion of 1:0.0026, twice daily for 10 days.Intestinal epithelial ultrastructure of WT HPM mice improved more than A20 HPM mice compared to MC mice. WT HPM mice exhibited greater expression of A20 compared with MC mice (P < 0.01). TNF-α, NF-kB p65, MLCK, MLC, TRAF6 and RIP1 levels in A20 and WT HPM mice were all decreased compared to MC mice (P < 0.01). NF-κB p65、MLCK and TRAF6 levels were increased in A20 HPM mice as compared to WT HPM mice (P < 0.05). Intestinal epithelial levels of occludin, claudin-1, ZO-1 and F-actin increased in all HPM mice (P  < 0.01-0.05), while occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1 levels were lower in A20  HPM mice (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, P < 0.01).HPM downregulates abnormal activation of the TNF-α-NF-κB-MLCK pathway by upregulating expression of A20 in a mouse model of CD, thereby protecting intestinal epithelial  and repairing the damage CD causes to the intestinal epithelial barrier.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The current study was conducted to investigate if a high concentrate (HC) supplemented with sodium butyrate can alleviate the inflammation and if an epigenetic mechanism is involved in regulating the expression of the key GPR41/43 genes in the cecum. Twelve lactating goats were randomly divided into two groups: the control group fed the HC diet and the treatment group fed the HC diet supplemented with sodium butyrate (HCB). Our results suggested that the supplementation of sodium butyrate significantly increased the pH value in the rumen and cecum, downregulated the expression of GPR41/43 and related inflammatory cytokines, upregulated the expression of  proteins, and reduced the protein expression levels of GPR 41/43, ERK1/2, and p38. Moreover, the ratios of DNA methylation and chromatin compaction in the promoter region of the GPR41/43 genes were altered due to the addition of sodium butyrate. In brief, dietary addition of sodium butyrate can reduce the inflammatory injury to the cecal mucosa in lactating goats and can affect the expression of GPR41/43 via epigenetic modification.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129422>Pharmacological stimulation of G-protein coupled receptor 40 alleviates cytokine-induced epithelial barrier disruption in airway epithelial Calu-3 cells.</a></h1><p>Impairment of airway  induced by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines is implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory airway diseases. Pharmacological stimulation of G-protein coupled receptor (GPR) 40, a receptor of polyunsaturated fatty , have recently been shown to promote  assembly in airway epithelial cells under non-inflammatory conditions. However, roles of GPR40 in regulating airway epithelial integrity in response to inflammatory insults are unknown. This study was aimed to investigate the effect of GPR40 stimulation on proinflammatory cytokine (TNFα and IL-1β)-induced  disruption in human airway epithelial Calu-3 cells using GW9508, a GPR40 agonist. We found that stimulation of GPR40 by GW9508 attenuated the cytokine-induced airway epithelial barrier leakage as analyzed by measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance and transepithelial flux of fluorescently labeled dextran (molecular weight of 4 kDa). Furthermore, GW9508 prevented the cytokine-induced dislocalization of zonula occludens (ZO)-1, occludin and claudin-1. The barrier-protective effect of GW9508 was abolished by a GPR40 antagonist, but not a GPR120 antagonist. Immunofluorescence staining of NF-ĸB indicated that GW9508 had no effect on cytokine-induced NF-ĸB activation. Intriguingly, GW9508 inhibited cytokine-induced airway epithelial barrier disruption through suppression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in a phospholipase C (PLC) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta (CaMKKβ)-dependent manner. Collectively, this study uncovered the novel role of GPR40 in preventing cytokine-induced  disruption in airway epithelial cells through mechanisms involving PLC-CaMKKβ-mediated suppression of ERK signaling. Pharmacological stimulation of GPR40 may be beneficial in the treatment of airway diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new method to allow for accurate measurements of in vitro drug absorption through the reduction of the UWL effect. Previously, we have developed an artificial intestinal tract that mimics the tubular structure of the human intestine and enables study of drug absorption under flow conditions. In order to determine whether our artificial intestinal tract has the potential to reduce the effect of a UWL on drug absorption, the present study evaluated drug absorption in Caco-2 cells using this artificial system. The viability and  structure of Caco-2 cells on the artificial intestinal tract were intact during perfusion. The cumulative amount of the highly lipophilic drugs imipramine and chlorpromazine accumulated in Caco-2 cells cultured on the cell culture plate was 1.5 times higher under mechanical agitation, whereas that of cells on the artificial intestinal tract was 6.5 times higher when internal flow was applied. In addition, the cumulative amounts of 5-aminosalicylic  and clonidine, drugs with low lipophilicity, accumulated in Caco-2 cells on the artificial intestinal tract were unchanged by internal flow. These results indicate that the artificial intestinal tract enables effective reduction of the UWL thickness at the Caco-2 cell-surface, and allows evaluation of in vitro drug absorption under conditions similar to those found in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075189>Ouabain Modulates the Adherens  in Renal Epithelial Cells.</a></h1><p>Ouabain, a well-known plant-derived toxin, is also a hormone found in mammals at nanomolar levels that binds to a site located in the a-subunit of Na⁺,K⁺-ATPase. Our main goal was to understand the physiological roles of ouabain. Previously, we found that ouabain increases the degree of  sealing, GAP -mediated communication and ciliogenesis. Considering our previous results, we investigated the effect of ouabain on adherens .We used immunofluorescence and immunoblot methods to measure the effect of 10 nM ouabain on the cellular and nuclear content of E-cadherin, β-catenin and γ-catenin in cultured monolayers of Marin Darby canine renal cells (MDCK). We also studied the effect of ouabain on adherens  biogenesis through sequential Ca²⁺ removal and replenishment. Then, we investigated whether c-Src and ERK1/2 kinases are involved in these responses.Ouabain enhanced the cellular content of the adherens  proteins E-cadherin, β-catenin and γ-catenin and displaced β-catenin and γ-catenin from the plasma membrane into the nucleus. Ouabain also increased the expression levels of E-cadherin and β-catenin in the plasma membrane after Ca²⁺ replenishment. These effects on adherens  were sensitive to PP2 and PD98059, suggesting that they depend on c-Src and ERK1/2 signaling. The translocation of β-catenin and γ-catenin into the nucleus was specific because ouabain did not change the localization of the  proteins ZO-1 and ZO-2. Moreover, in ouabain-resistant MDCK cells, which express a Na⁺,K⁺-ATPase α1-subunit with low affinity for ouabain, this hormone was unable to regulate adherens , indicating that the ouabain receptor that regulates adherens  is Na⁺,K⁺-ATPase.Ouabain (10 nM) upregulated adherens . This novel result supports the proposition that one of the physiological roles of this hormone is the modulation of cell contacts.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Here, we show that indole-3-propionic  (IPA), a tryptophan metabolite produced by gut bacteria, is a potent anti-non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) microbial metabolite. Here, we demonstrate that administration of IPA modulates the microbiota composition in the gut and inhibits microbial dysbiosis in rats fed a high-fat diet. IPA induces the expression of  proteins, such as ZO-1 and Occludin, and maintains intestinal epithelium homeostasis, leading to a reduction in plasma endotoxin levels. Interestingly, IPA inhibits NF-κB signaling and reduces the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6, in response to endotoxin in macrophages to repress hepatic inflammation and liver injury. Moreover, IPA is sufficient to inhibit the expression of fibrogenic and collagen genes and attenuate diet-induced NASH phenotypes. The beneficial effects of IPA on the liver are likely mediated through inhibiting the production of endotoxin in the gut. These findings suggest a protective role of IPA in the control of metabolism and uncover the gut microbiome and liver cross-talk in regulating the intestinal microenvironment and liver pathology via a novel dietary nutrient metabolite. IPA may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating NASH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31489648>Wnt/β-Catenin signaling plays a protective role in the Mdr2 KO murine model of cholestatic liver disease.</a></h1><p>The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has a well-described role in liver pathobiology. Its suppression was recently shown to decrease bile  (BA) synthesis, thus preventing the development of cholestatic liver injury and fibrosis after bile duct ligation (BDL). To generalize these observations, we suppressed β-catenin in Mdr2 knockout (KO) mice, which develop sclerosing cholangitis due to regurgitation of BA from leaky ducts. When β-catenin was knocked down (KD) in KO for 2 weeks, hepatic and biliary injury were exacerbated in comparison to KO given placebo, as shown by serum biochemistry, ductular reaction, inflammation, and fibrosis. Simultaneously, KO/KD livers displayed increased oxidative stress and senescence and an impaired regenerative response. Although total liver BA levels were similar between KO/KD and KO, there was significant dysregulation of BA transporters and BA detoxification/synthesis enzymes in KO/KD compared to KO alone. Multiphoton intravital microscopy revealed a mixing of blood and bile in the sinusoids, and validated the presence of increased serum BA in KO/KD mice. Although hepatocyte  were intact, KO/KD livers had significant canalicular defects, which resulted from loss of hepatocyte polarity. Thus, in contrast to the protective effect of β-catenin KD in BDL model, β-catenin KD in Mdr2 KO aggravated rather than alleviated injury by interfering with expression of BA transporters, hepatocyte polarity, canalicular structure, and the regenerative response. The resulting imbalance between ongoing injury and restitution led to worsening of the Mdr2 KO phenotype, suggesting caution in targeting β-catenin globally for all cholestatic conditions.

Serum/plasma concentrations of zonulin (a regulator of enterocyte ),  proteins (ZO-1 and occludin), intestinal fatty  binding protein (IFABP)/ileal bile  binding protein (IBABP), D-lactate, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein were measured.Zonulin concentrations were significantly higher when a concurrent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption (Gad+ RRMS) and were correlated with  proteins. IBABP and D-lactate were elevated in people with RRMS compared to controls, but did not discriminate between Gad+ and Gad- subgroups. Baseline zonulin concentrations were associated with 1-year disease progression in progressive MS.People with MS have altered biomarkers of intestinal barrier integrity. Zonulin concentrations are associated with 1-year disease progression in progressive MS and closely mirror BBB breakdown in RRMS. Zonulin may mediate breakdown of both the intestinal barrier and the BBB in gut dysbiosis through the regulation of . This could explain how the gut-brain axis modulates neuroinflammation in MS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30463769>Effect of Simvastatin on the Intestinal Rho/ROCK Signaling Pathway in Rats With Sepsis.</a></h1><p>Simvastatin may alleviate the intestinal barrier dysfunction induced by sepsis. This study aimed to investigate the role of the Ras homolog (Rho)/Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway in the intestinal barrier of simvastatin-treated rats with sepsis.Male Wistar rats were pretreated with simvastatin (0.2 μg/g of body weight) for 1 week before cecal ligation and puncture. Twenty-four hours after cecal ligation and puncture, the condition of bacterial translocation was evaluated. Plasma levels of intestinal fatty  binding protein, D-lactic  and inflammatory factors, and oxidative stress in the intestine were determined. The intestinal injury scores, as well as the protein levels of Rho, ROCK1, and  proteins ZO-1 and occludin were analyzed.Treatment with simvastatin alleviated the sepsis-induced increases in the plasma concentration of intestinal fatty  binding protein and D-lactic , as well as the number of colony-forming units in the bacterial culture of the blood, liver, spleen, and kidney. In addition, simvastatin effectively reduced the intestinal levels of tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-6, high-mobility group box 1, and malondialdehyde and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase in rats with sepsis. Staining with hematoxylin and eosin showed that severe intestinal injury occurred in the sepsis group, which was reduced by the treatment of simvastatin. Furthermore, the expression of Rho and ROCK1 was significantly downregulated and the protein expression levels of ZO-1 and occludin were significantly increased in simvastatin-treated rats (P < 0.05).Simvastatin can ameliorate the intestinal barrier dysfunction caused by sepsis by inhibiting the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway and reducing the levels of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress in the intestine, which also increase the expression of  proteins.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Individuals in areas where malaria is endemic possess EBA-140-specific antibodies, and individuals with high antibody titers to this protein have a lower rate of reinfection by parasites. The red blood cell binding segment of EBA-140 is comprised of two Duffy-binding-like domains, called F1 and F2, that together create region II. The sialic -binding pocket of F1 is essential for binding, whereas the sialic -binding pocket in F2 appears dispensable. Here, we show that immunization of mice with the complete region II results in poorly neutralizing antibodies. In contrast, immunization of mice with the functionally relevant F1 domain of region II results in antibodies that confer a 2-fold increase in parasite neutralization compared to that of the F2 domain. Epitope mapping of diverse F1 and F2 monoclonal antibodies revealed that the functionally relevant F1 sialic -binding pocket is a privileged site inaccessible to antibodies, that the F2 sialic -binding pocket contains a nonneutralizing epitope, and that two additional epitopes reside in F1 on the opposite face from the sialic -binding pocket. These studies indicate that focusing the immune response to the functionally important F1 sialic  binding pocket improves the protective immune response of EBA-140. These results have implications for improving future vaccine designs and emphasize the importance of structural vaccinology for malaria.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31196628>The second PDZ domain of scaffold protein Frmpd2 binds to GluN2A of NMDA receptors.</a></h1><p>The scaffold proteins Frmpd2 is localized at the basolateral membranes of polarized epithelial cells and associated with  formation. In this report, we found that the Frmpd2 is specifically expressed at postsynaptic membrane. By using of co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down, Frmpd2 was reported to interact with postsynaptic excitatory N-methyl-d-aspartic  (NMDA) receptors in vivo and in vitro. In addition, we demonstrated that the second PDZ (PDZ2) domain but not the first or third PDZ domain of Frmpd2 binds to the C-terminus of GluN2A and GluN2B, two subunits of NMDA receptors. By surface plasmon resonance, the affinity of Frmpd2-isolated PDZ2 to GluN2A and GluN2B was identified, which indicates that the interaction of Frmpd2 to GluN2A subunit is more strongly than that to GluN2B subunit. The crystal structure of the PDZ2 domain of the mouse homologue of Frmpd2 was further solved. Some amino  residues of the PDZ2 structure are supposed to associate with the GluN2A binding. Our study suggests that the scaffold protein Frmpd2 is probably involved in synaptic NMDA receptors-mediated neural excitatory and neurotoxicity in a PDZ2 domain-dependent manner.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

One of the areas that has the potential to improve the efficacy of cancer therapies is the development of novel drug delivery technologies. In particular, the design of pH-sensitive polymeric complexation hydrogels may allow for targeted oral delivery of a wide variety of chemotherapeutic drugs and proteins.

Here, we show that interventions that restore butyrate intestinal levels mitigate clinical and pathological features of C. difficile-induced colitis. Butyrate has no effect on C. difficile colonization or toxin production. However, it attenuates intestinal inflammation and improves intestinal barrier function in infected mice, as shown by reduced intestinal epithelial permeability and bacterial translocation, effects associated with the increased expression of components of intestinal epithelial cell . Activation of the transcription factor HIF-1 in intestinal epithelial cells exerts a protective effect in C. difficile-induced colitis, and it is required for butyrate effects.

This study investigated the effect of the administration of FMT from highly feed efficient donors early in life on the jejunal and cecal microbiota, visceral organ size, intestinal morphology, permeability, and expression of genes for nutrient transporters, barrier function and innate immune response in chickens of diverging residual feed intake (RFI; a metric for FE). Chicks ( = 110) were inoculated with the FMT or control transplant (CT) on 1, 6, and 9 days posthatch (dph), from which 56 chickens were selected on 30 dph as the extremes in RFI, resulting in 15 low and 13 high RFI chickens receiving the FMT and 14 low and 14 high RFI chickens receiving the CT. RFI rank and FMT only caused tendencies for alterations in the jejunal microbiota and only one unclassified  genus in cecal digesta was indicative of high RFI. By contrast, the FMT caused clear differences in the short-chain fatty  (SCFA) profile in the crop and cecal microbiota composition compared to the CT, which indicated alterations in amylolytic, pullulanolytic and hemicellulolytic bacteria such as , , and . Moreover, the FMT caused alterations in intestinal development as indicated by the longer duodenum and shallower crypts in the ceca. From the observed RFI-associated variation, energy-saving mechanisms and moderation of the mucosal immune response were indicated by higher jejunal permeability, shorter villi in the ileum, and enhanced cecal expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine  in low RFI chickens. Relationships obtained from supervised multigroup data integration support that certain bacteria, including , and unclassified -phylotypes, and SCFA in jejunal and cecal digesta modulated expression levels of cytokines,  protein  and nutrient transporters for glucose and SCFA uptake. In conclusion, results suggest that the intestine only played a moderate role for the RFI-associated variation of the present low and high RFI phenotypes, whereas modulating the early microbial colonization resulted in long-lasting changes in bacterial taxonomic and metabolite composition as well as in host intestinal development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840856>Sodium butyrate supplementation in high-soybean meal diets for turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.): Effects on inflammatory status, mucosal barriers and microbiota in the intestine.</a></h1><p>A 12-week feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary sodium butyrate (NaBT) on the intestinal health of juvenile turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.), in terms of inflammatory status, mucosal barriers and microbiota. Three isonitrogenous and isolipidic practical diets were used: (1) fish meal based group (FM); (2) soybean meal group (SBM), soy protein replacing 40% fish meal protein in FM; (3) NaBT group, 0.2% NaBT supplemented in SBM. Each diet was fed to triplicate tanks (30 fish in each tank). The current results showed that 0.2% dietary NaBT improved the growth performance of fish and alleviated the enteropathy, increasing the absorptive surface and mitigating the infiltration of mixed leukocytes in lamina propria. Fish fed the NaBT diet presented increased activities of intestinal brush border enzyme and similar nutrient digestibility with the FM group. Compared to SBM, the inclusion of 0.2% NaBT in diet significantly up-regulated the intestinal gene expression of  proteins and down-regulated the gene expression of TNF-α and NF-κB. The gut microbial communities of the NaBT group were closer to the FM group than to the SBM group, in terms of PCoA, UPGMA and Heatmap analyses based on weighted Unifrac distance. The relative abundance of several dominant bacteria at the phylum (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Deinococcus-Thermus and Actinobacteria) and genus level (Thermus, Acinetobacter, Bacteroides and Silanimonas) were altered by dietary NaBT. In conclusion, dietary NaBT had positive roles in protecting the intestinal health of turbot from the impairment of soybean meal.Copyright © 2019.

Different in vitro models of the lung epithelial barrier have been characterized using non-degradable polyethylene terephthalate membranes which limits their uses for tissue engineering. Although poly-L-lactic  (PLLA) membranes are biodegradable, those prepared via conventional Diffusion Induced Phase Separation (DIPS) lack open-porous geometry and show limited permeability compromising their use for epithelial barrier studies. Here we used PLLA membranes prepared via a modification of the standard DIPS protocol to control the membrane surface morphology and permeability. These were bonded to cell culture inserts for use in barrier function studies. Pulmonary epithelial cells (H441) readily attached to the PLLA membranes and formed a confluent cell layer within two days. This was accompanied by a significant increase in trans-epithelial electrical resistance and correlated with the formation of  and vectorial cytokine secretion in response to TNFα. Our data suggest that a structurally polarized and functional epithelial barrier can be established on PLLA membranes produced via a non-standard DIPS protocol. Therefore, PLLA membranes have potential utility in lung tissue engineering applications requiring bio-absorbable membranes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401199>Labrasol® is an efficacious intestinal permeation enhancer across rat intestine: Ex vivo and in vivo rat studies.</a></h1><p>Labrasol® ALF (Labrasol®), is a non-ionic surfactant excipient primarily used as a solubilising agent. It was investigated here as an intestinal permeation enhancer in isolated rat colonic mucosae in Ussing chamber and in rat in situ intestinal instillations. Labrasol® comprises mono-, di- and triglycerides and mono- and di- fatty  esters of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-8 and free PEG-8, with caprylic (C)- and capric  (C) as the main fatty . Source components of Labrasol® as well as Labrasol® modified with either C or C as the sole fatty  components were also tested to determine which element of Labrasol® was responsible for its permeability-enhancing properties. Labrasol® (4, 8 mg/mL) enhanced the transport of the paracellular markers, [C] mannitol, FITC-dextran 4000, and FITC-insulin across colonic mucosae. The enhancement was non-damaging, transient, and molecular weight-dependent. The PEG ester fraction of Labrasol® also had enhancing properties. When insulin was administered with Labrasol® in instillations, it had a relative bioavailability of 7% in jejunum and 12% in colon. C- and C versions of Labrasol® and the PEG ester fraction also induced similar bioavailability values in jejunal instillations: 6, 5 and 7% respectively. Inhibition of lipases in instillations did not reduce the efficacy of Labrasol®, suggesting that its mechanism as a PE is not simply due to liberated medium chain fatty . Labrasol® acts as an efficacious intestinal permeation enhancer and has potential for use in oral formulations of macromolecules and BCS Class III molecules.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Factors secreted by tumor cells contribute to the maintenance of tumor vascular networks. How tumor cell-derived protein signals regulate ZO-1 expression is unclear. Here, we explored the effect of tumor cell-secreted asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) on the permeability of endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment. First, we confirmed the existence of AEP in conditioned medium (CM) from AEP-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells. Treatment with CM from AEP-overexpressing tumor cells increased the permeability and tumor cell transversal of an endothelial monolayer. Furthermore, CM from AEP-overexpressing tumor cells suppressed endothelial ZO-1 expression, as well as ZO-1-associated nucleic  binding protein ZONAB. In addition, the level of phosphorylated STAT3 was increased by treatment with AEP-containing CM. A mutation of RGD or blocking integrin αvβ3 with antibody recovered the ZO-1 downregulation induced by AEP. In vivo, a lung metastatic mouse model showed increased endothelial permeability in the AEP-overexpressing group compared with the control group. An orthotopic tumor transplantation model was established using AEP-overexpression and compared with mice receiving control 4T1 cells. Compared with controls, overexpression of AEP increased lung metastatic foci and area, as well as vascular instability in primary tumors or lung metastatic sites. Moreover, endothelial ZO-1 was decreased in the AEP-overexpressing group. Taken together, our data show that tumor cell-derived AEP increases the permeability of endothelial barriers. Interactions between RGD and endothelial integrin αvβ3 mediate this effect by downregulating ZO-1.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report on a bile duct-on-a-chip that phenocopies not only the tubular architecture of the bile duct in three dimensions, but also its barrier functions.We showed that mouse cholangiocytes in the channel of the device became polarized and formed mature , that the permeability of the cholangiocyte monolayer was comparable to ex vivo measurements, and that cholangiocytes in the device were mechanosensitive (as demonstrated by changes in calcium flux under applied luminal flow). Permeability decreased significantly when cells formed a compact monolayer with cell densities comparable to those observed in vivo. This device enabled independent access to the apical and basolateral surfaces of the cholangiocyte channel, allowing proof-of-concept toxicity studies with the biliary toxin, biliatresone, and the bile , glycochenodeoxycholic . The cholangiocyte basolateral side was more vulnerable than the apical side to treatment with either agent, suggesting a protective adaptation of the apical surface that is normally exposed to bile. Further studies revealed a protective role of the cholangiocyte apical glycocalyx, wherein disruption of the glycocalyx with neuraminidase increased the permeability of the cholangiocyte monolayer after treatment with glycochenodeoxycholic .This bile duct-on-a-chip captured essential features of a simplified bile duct in structure and organ-level functions and represents an in vitro platform to study the pathophysiology of the bile duct using cholangiocytes from a variety of sources.© 2019 The Authors.

Cerebral ischemia is a major cause of endothelial dysfunction which can disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)/reperfusion promote cell death and BBB breakdown in brain endothelial cells. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic  (AKBA), a biologically active phytoconstituent of the medicinal plant Boswellia serrata, has been shown to be protective against various inflammatory diseases as well as ischemic brain injury. The molecular mechanisms underlying these beneficial characteristics of AKBA are poorly understood. We subjected bEND.3 cells to OGD/reperfusion to investigate the protective role of AKBA in this model. We found that AKBA treatment attenuated endothelial cell death and oxidative stress assessed by means of TUNEL assay, cleaved-caspase-3, and dihydroethidium (DHE) staining. Furthermore, OGD downregulated  proteins ZO-1 and Occludin levels, and increased the expressions of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, ICAM-1, and complement C3a receptor (C3aR). We also noticed the increased phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 in bEND.3 cells in OGD group. AKBA treatment significantly attenuated expression levels of these inflammatory proteins and prevented the degradation of ZO-1 and Occludin following OGD. In conclusion, AKBA treatment provides protection against endothelial cell dysfunction following OGD by attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30431711>In vitro characteristics of an airway barrier-disrupting factor secreted by Staphylococcus aureus.</a></h1><p>Staphylococcus aureus is a major contributor to the pathophysiology of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Previous research has shown that S. aureus-secreted products disrupt the airway barrier.S. aureus ATCC 13565 and 25923 strains were grown at exponential, postexponential, and stationary phases. Microbial conditioned media (CM) was collected from the cultures and ultrafiltered (UF). Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) was performed on the UF-CM. UF-CM was subjected to heat and protease treatment, size fractionation, and ultracentrifugation (UC) separation. Human nasal epithelial cells grown at air-liquid interface (HNEC-ALI) cultures were exposed to purified alpha hemolysin (Hla), staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA), lipoteichoic  (LTA), and UF-CM. Barrier function outcomes were measured by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and apparent permeability (Papp). UC fraction exposed cultures were subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy for  (TJ) protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1).LC-ESI-MS/MS identified 107 proteins, with Hla being most abundant. Hla, SEA, and LTA did not alter the HNEC-ALI barrier as measured by TEER or Papp. Barrier disruption caused by UF-CM peaked in the postexponential phase, was sensitive to heat and protease treatment, >30-kDa in size, and enriched in the UC fraction. HNEC-ALI exposed to UF-CM and UC demonstrated loss of ZO-1 localization.These results suggest that the S. aureus factor responsible for TJ disruption in HNEC-ALI cultures is either a protein-macromolecule or a combination of secreted factors. The product is enriched in the UC fraction, suggesting it is associated with large structures such as membrane components or vesicles.© 2018 ARS-AAOA, LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470289>Brazilian propolis extract reduces intestinal barrier defects and inflammation in a colitic mouse model.</a></h1><p>Brazilian propolis is rich in cinnamic  derivatives and reportedly reduces intestinal inflammation in rodents; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that the regulation of  (TJ) barrier, Th17 cell differentiation, and/or, macrophage activation by cinnamic  derivatives were involved in the propolis-mediated anti-inflammatory effect. Mice were orally administered 2% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in combination with either the feeding control or a diet containing 0.3% ethanol extract of Brazilian propolis for 9 days. DSS administration induced acute colitis in mice, whereas the propolis extract mitigated DSS-induced weight loss; colon shortening; increased plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; reduced expression of TJ proteins, such as zonula occludens, junctional adhesion molecule-A, occludin, and claudins; and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, interleukin (IL) 6, and IL-17a. Cinnamic  derivatives, such as artepillin C and caffeic  phenethyl ester, present in the propolis extract suppressed the IL-17 production from cultured murine splenocytes through decreased retinoic -related orphan receptor gT expression. Baccharin, drupanin, and culifolin, which are also present in Brazilian propolis, reduced the TNF-α and/or IL-6 production by suppressing inflammatory signaling in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages. Taken together, the regulation of Th17 differentiation and macrophage activation by cinnamic  derivatives, at least in part, contribute to the anti-inflammatory effect mediated by Brazilian propolis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

These effects have been speculated to occur via the gut microbiome. In this study, we administered either berberine or metformin to db/db mice and investigated changes in body weight, food intake, and blood glucose levels. Fresh stool samples were analyzed using 16 s rDNA high-throughput sequencing to evaluate the gut microbiome. Short-chain fatty  (SCFA) in the stool were quantified using gas chromatography. The expression of NF-κB signaling pathway and  (ZO1 and occludin) proteins in the intestinal epithelium was determined using qPCR and western blotting. The intestinal barrier structure was examined using transmission electron microscopy and serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was measured using a commercial kit. Both berberine and metformin reduced food intake, body weight, and blood glucose and HbA1c levels. Both treatments effectively restored the intestinal SCFA content, reduced the level of serum LPS, relieved intestinal inflammation, and repaired intestinal barrier structure. Intervention with metformin or berberine modified the gut microbiome in db/db mice, increasing the number of SCFA-producing bacteria (e.g., Butyricimonas, Coprococcus, Ruminococcus) and reducing opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Prevotella, Proteus). An increased abundance of other probiotics including Lactobacillus and Akkermansia was also observed. Berberine and metformin can modulate the composition of the gut microbiome and reduce body weight, blood glucose levels, and intestinal inflammation in db/db mice, which demonstrates their effectiveness in the reduction of diabetic complications in this model.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In the intestine, VA are known to promote mucosal homeostasis and immunity. However, the effect of VA in intestinal development has not been well elucidated. In the present study, we generated human intestine organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and investigated the effect of the VA active metabolite all-trans retinoic  (RA), on differentiation into intestinal organoids. As a result, RA increased the gene expression of a drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4, as a functional molecule of intestinal mature development, in iPSC-derived intestinal organoids. In addition, RA increased transepithelial electrical resistance, an indicator of epithelial integrity, and decreased the permeability of monolayers to fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran in intestinal epithelial monolayers. Finally, RA increased the expression of ZO-1, a marker of , which are essential for intestinal epithelial barrier function. Taken together, these results indicate that RA promotes barrier functions of iPSC-derived intestinal epithelial monolayers by increasing ZO-1 expression.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The absorptive function has to be highly selective to prevent simultaneous entry of microbes and toxins from the rumen into the blood. As such, epithelial absorption is primarily transcellular, whereas the paracellular pathway appears rather tightly sealed. A network of  (claudin-1, claudin-4, and occludin) and -associated proteins (e.g., zonula occludens) accomplishes the latter. When microbial fermentation activity is high such as with highly fermentable diets, rumen epithelial functions are often challenged by acidity, high osmolarity, toxins (e.g., endotoxin and histamine), and immune mediators (inflammatory mediators and cytokines) released during local and systemic inflammation. Epithelial damage by low pH in combination with high luminal SCFA concentrations is not immediately reversible and may initially aggravate upon return to physiological pH. In contrast, barrier opening upon hyperosmolarity is acutely transient. The initial insults set by luminal acidity and SCFA and the increasing concentrations of microbial-associated molecular patterns such as lipopolysaccharides are key factors that trigger inflammation not only in the rumen but also in the hindgut (cecum and colon), which reach out to the liver and other organs, causing systemic inflammation. Low feed intake during parturition, transportation, heat stress, or disease is the second most relevant challenge for the ruminal epithelial barrier. The barrier opening is usually only transient and quickly restored upon refeeding. Due to a rapid, dose-dependent, and prolonged decrease in absorption capacity for SCFA, however, any feed restriction increases the odds for postrestriction subacute ruminal acidosis. Inflammation due to acidosis can be alleviated by supplemental thiamine, yeasts, and plant bioactive (phytogenic) compounds. Butyrate is used in weaning calves to support ruminal barrier development; however, excess butyrate may promote hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, and epithelial injury in the fully developed rumen of adult cows. Further research is needed to enhance the understanding of the various factors that counteract barrier impairment and help barrier restoration during acidogenic feeding, especially when concurring with unavoidable periods of feed restriction.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

However, the precise mechanisms underlying the immunoregulatory and antiviral activities of immunobiotics have not yet been elucidated in detail. The present study was conducted to determine whether selected lactic  bacteria (LAB) modulate toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic  (PolyI:C) induced viral response in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). PolyI:C increased the expression of interferon-β (IFN-β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in HCT116 cells, and these up-regulations were significantly altered when cells were pre-stimulated with LAB isolated from Korean fermented foods. LAB strains were capable to up-regulate IFN-β but down-regulated IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and IL-1β mRNA levels as compared with PolyI: C. HCT-116 cell treatment with LABs beneficially modulated the mRNA levels of C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL-10), 2-5A oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OSA1), myxovirus resistance protein (MxA), TLR3, and retinoic  inducible gene-I (RIG-I), and TLR negative regulators. In addition, LABs increased IFN-β, IFN-α, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) and decreased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-1β protein/mRNA levels in THP-1 cells. LABs also protected the cells by maintaining  proteins (zonula occludens-1 and occludin). The beneficial effects of these LABs were mediated via modulation of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways. Overall, the results of this study indicate that immunobiotics have potent antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities that may use as antiviral substitutes for human and animal applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008098> HY7714 Restores TNF-α Induced Defects on .</a></h1><p>In addition to intestinal balance, probiotics are known to have beneficial effects on skin inflammation, metabolic diseases, and emotions. Previously, we have reported the skin anti-aging effects of  HY7714 (HY7714) in a clinical trial. To prove the protective skin effects of HY7714 through the intestinal  (TJ), we investigated the effects of HY7714 on the intestines through tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α induced TJ defects in Caco-2 cells. Specifically, 24 h treatment with HY7714 restored the decreased expression of zonula occludens-1, occludin, and claudin-1 compared to the TNF-α-treated groups (<0.05). It also attenuated the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6, 8, and 1β. Further, increases in the mRNA levels of Elk-1, nuclear factor-κB, and myosin light chain kinase expression induced by TNF-α were recovered by HY7714. These findings imply that HY7714 improves intestinal barrier integrity and is a potential therapeutic agent for dysfunctions derived from TJ defects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31389714>Effects of a feed additive blend on broilers challenged with heat stress.</a></h1><p>We evaluated a blend of medium-chain fatty  (MCFA), organic , and a polyphenol antioxidant on gut integrity. Eighty Ross Broilers were exposed to 20-22°C (control - normothermic) or to 35-39.5°C (heat stress) for eight hours a day for a period of 1 or 5 days. Birds were fed a standard diet, or a diet supplemented with the test blend. Thereafter, birds were euthanized, and intestinal sections were excised for morphological, morphometric and gene expression analyses. Blood samples were collected for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) determination. Heart and liver tissues were used to quantify the expression of heat shock proteins 60 and 70 (HSP60 and HSP70, respectively) and inhibitor of kappa light chain gene enhancer in B cells alpha (IKBA). The jejunum was the most sensitive intestinal section, where heat stress modulated the expression of HSP70, of the inflammatory markers IKBA, interleukin 8 (IL-8), interferon gamma (IFNγ), and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Moreover, expression of  (CLDN1, ZO1 and ZO2) and nutrient transporters (PEPT1 and EAAT3) was modulated especially in the jejunum. In conclusion, the feed additive blend protected intestines during heat stress from the decrease in villus height and crypt depth, and from the increase in villus width. Especially in the jejunum, heat stress played an important role by modulating oxidative stress and inflammation, impairing gut integrity and nutrient transport, and such deleterious effects were alleviated by the feed additive blend.  Jejunum is the most sensitive intestinal segment during heat stress. Heat stress affects the expression of  and nutrient transporters. Feed management helps to alleviate the disturbances caused by heat stress.

The BTB is essential for maintaining the microenvironment necessary for normal spermatogenesis. This study investigated whether retinoic  (RA) may regulate the proteins that are essential for integrity of the BTB in cryptorchidism. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were administrated flutamide during late pregnancy to induce a model of cryptorchidism in male offspring. The concentrations of RA and BTB  and gap  protein levels were significantly lower in untreated cryptorchid pups compared with normal pups, but almost normal in cryptorchid pups given RA.

Proper epithelial function mainly depends on  (TJs), which act as both ion channels and a barrier against noxious molecules. TJs are multiprotein complexes consisting of transmembrane and membrane-associated proteins. Because the intestine in piglets is immature and incomplete, its structure and function are easily impaired by various stresses, infections, and food-related factors. Certain nutrients have been demonstrated to participate in intestinal TJ regulation. Probiotics, amino , fibers, oligosaccharide, and certain micronutrients can enhance barrier integrity and counteract infections through elevated TJ protein expression and distribution. In this review, the distribution and classification of intestinal TJs is described, the factors influencing TJs after weaning are summarized, and the regulation of weaning piglet intestinal TJs by nutrients is discussed.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570498>Hepatic Bile Formation: Canalicular osmolarity and paracellular and transcellular water flow.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this minireview is to indicate that a new paradigm is developing regarding hepatic bile flow. The focus thus far has been on the carrier-mediated transport of bile  and other solutes, such as glutathione, which create an osmotic gradient for the transcellular and paracellular flow of water into canaliculi. In addition to the physico-chemical properties of the bile , which govern the osmotic gradient, data now exists that the , governing paracellular water flow, and Aquaporin-8 water channels, governing transcellular water flow, are regulated independently. Thus, the rate of water flow into the canaliculus in response to bile  transport is variable and determines canalicular bile  concentration, which affects the production and solubilization of cholesterol-lecithin vesicles. These new considerations modify thinking regarding the occurrence of cholestasis and its progression and re-orient the design of experimental studies that can distinguish the different determinants of bile flow. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The paradigm that water flow into the canaliculus is determined only by the rate of carrier-mediated transport has been challenged recently by the changes that occur in hepatic bile composition in the Claudin-2 knockout mouse and with the cholestatic effect of estradiol 17-D-glucuronide. Thus, respectively, a reduction in paracellular or transcellular canalicular water flow, probably via Aquaporin 8, has no significant effect on bile  excretion.The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31329991>Effect of dietary graded resistant potato starch levels on growth performance, plasma cytokines concentration, and intestinal health in meat ducks.</a></h1><p>The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary graded raw potato starch (RPS) levels on growth performance, plasma cytokines concentration, ileal barrier function, and cecal short-chain fatty  (SCFA) concentration in meat ducks from 1 to 35 D of age. This study included 2 experiments. In experiment (Exp.) 1, sixteen 35-day-old meat ducks were used to evaluate the AME of RPS by orogastric administration. Results showed the AME value of RPS on ducks is 2.76 kcal/g. In Exp. 2, a total of 600 one-day-old ducklings were randomly assigned to 5 isonitrogenous and isoenergetic dietary treatments that included 0 (control), 6, 12, 18, and 24% RPS, respectively. Samples were collected at both of 14 and 35 D. Neither growth performance nor ileal parameters (length, weight, and pH) at both of 14 and 35 D was affected by dietary RPS. However, the mucosal thickness (14 D), villus height (except for 18% RPS at 14 D), and the villus height: crypt depth ratio (14 and 35 D) of the ileum were increased in the 12 and 18% RPS diets when compared to 0% RPS diet. Meanwhile, proinflammatory factors such as plasma interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 (14 D) reduced in 12% RPS diet and tumor necrosis factor α decreased in 12% (except for 14 D) and 18% RPS groups. When compared with the control group, diets with 18% RPS significantly increased mucin 2 gene expression at 14 D, and 12% RPS elevated the mRNA expression of  proteins including Zonula occludens-1 and Claudin 1 (except for 14 D) in the ileal mucosa of birds. Furthermore, ducks fed 12% RPS diet had higher concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate in cecal digesta than other groups. These findings indicated that diets with 12 and/or 18% RPS increased the cecal SCFA concentration, which subsequently enhanced the barrier function and improved intestinal health in the ileum for 14 and 35-day-old meat ducks.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306972>Berberine improves intestinal epithelial  by upregulating A20 expression in IBS-D mice.</a></h1><p>To investigate effects of berberine exerts on A20 expression and regulation of intestinal epithelial  via the TNF-α-NF-κB-MLCK pathway in Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D). C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and A20 IEC-KO mice (48 each) were randomly divided into normal control (NC), model control (MC), rifaximin and berberine groups (12 mice per group). An experimental model of IBS-D was established using 4% acetic  and evaluated by haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. rifaximin and berberine mice were treated with rifaximin and berberine, respectively. Intestinal epithelial space of WT berberine mice improved more than A20 IEC-KO berberine mice compared to MC mice. WT berberine mice exhibited greater expression of A20 compared with MC mice(P < 0.01). TNF-α, NF-kB p65, MLCK, MLC, TRAF6 and RIP1 levels in A20 IEC-KO and WT berberine mice were all decreased compared to MC mice(P all<0.05). NF-κB p65, MLCK and TRAF6 levels were increased in A20 IEC-KO berberine mice as compared to WT berberine mice (P all<0.05). Intestinal epithelial levels of occludin, claudin-1, ZO-1 and F-actin increased in all berberine mice (P all<0.01-0.05), while occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1 levels were lower in A20 IEC-KO berberine mice(P < 0.05). Berberine downregulates abnormal activation of the TNF-α-NF-κB-MLCK pathway by upregulating expression of A20 in a mouse model of IBS-D, thereby protecting intestinal epithelial  and repairing the damage IBS-D causes to the intestinal epithelial barrier.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Among postinflammatory sequelae, one-third of patients with IBD are suffering from functional symptoms or psychological comorbidities that persist during remission. The aim of our study was to assess functional and behavioral sequelae of chronic colitis in rats with quiescent intestinal inflammation. Chronic colitis was induced by a weekly intrarectal injection of increasing concentrations of trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS) for 3 wk (15-45 mg of TNBS) in 30 rats, whereas the control rats ( = 24) received the vehicle. At 50 days post-TNBS, visceral sensitivity was assessed by visceromotor response to colorectal distension, and transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) expression was also quantified in the colon and dorsal root ganglia. Barrier function and inflammatory response were assessed by studying intestinal permeability,  protein, myeloperoxidase activity, histological score, and cytokine production (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α). Anxiety behavioral tests were performed from 50 to 64 days after the last TNBS injection. Chronic TNBS induced ) a visceral hypersensitivity ( = 0.03), ) an increased colon weight-to-length ratio ( = 0.01), ) higher inflammatory and fibrosis scores ( = 0.0390 and  = 0.0016, respectively), and ) a higher colonic IL-6 and IL-10 production ( = 0.008 and  = 0.005, respectively) compared with control rats. Intestinal permeability, colonic production of TNF-α, myeloperoxidase activity, and TRPV1 expression did not differ among groups. Chronic TNBS increased anxiety-related behavior in the open-field test and in the acoustic stress test. In conclusion, chronic colitis induced functional sequelae such as visceral hypersensitivity and increased anxiety with a low-grade intestinal inflammation. Development of a representative animal model will allow defining novel therapeutic approaches to achieve a better management of IBD-related sequelae.  Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases have impaired quality of life. Therapeutic progress to control mucosal inflammation provides us an opportunity to develop novel approaches to understand mechanisms behind postinflammatory sequelae. We used a chronic colitis model to study long-term sequelae on visceral pain, gut barrier function, and psychological impact. Chronic colitis induced functional symptoms and increased anxiety in the remission period. It might define novel therapeutic approaches to achieve a better inflammatory bowel disease-related sequelae management.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31072454>Oleanolic  causes reversible contraception in male mice by increasing the permeability of the germinal epithelium.</a></h1><p>The effects of oleanolic  (OA) on the fertility of male mice were investigated using both invivo and invitro experimental models. The experimental group (n=12) was treated with a daily dose of 30mgOAkg-1 bodyweight (i.p.), while the control group (n=6) received a daily dose of 10% ethanol solution (1mLkg-1 bodyweight). The effect of OA on the permeability status of TM4 Sertoli monolayers was investigated by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), intracellular electrical resistance and semiquantitative RT-PCR. After 45 days, OA-treated males produced no pregnancies but in the control group, all 12 females were impregnated (69 offspring). Male mice, which demonstrated sterility when exposed to OA, recovered their fertility after 30 days (78 offspring). Testicular histological observations of OA-treated mice showed detachment of adjacent Sertoli-Sertoli cells. A control monolayer developed TER of 300-400 Ω.cm2, but OA (50, 100, 200µgL-1) treated monolayers developed TER of approximately 100Ω.cm2. Intracellular electrophysiological and RT-PCR data supported the premise that OA compromised  junctional permeability. The study demonstrated reversible contraception in male mice by increasing the permeability of the germinal epithelium and further postulates that contraceptive reversibility is brought about by the reconstitution of the paracellular  between adjacent Sertoli cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302308>Effects of starter feeding on caecal mucosal bacterial composition and expression of genes involved in immune and  in pre-weaned twin lambs.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to explore the effects of starter feeding on caecal mucosal bacterial composition and the expression of genes involved in immune and  in pre-weaned lambs. Six pairs of new-born twin lambs were selected. From 10 days of age, one lamb of each pair received ewe's milk only (M group, n = 6), while the other one was fed ewe's milk plus starter feed (M + S group, n = 6). At 56 days of age, the lambs were sacrificed, and then cecum digesta was collected to measure pH values and concentrations of volatile fatty  (VFA), and caecal mucosa were collected to determine the changes in bacterial communities and the mRNA expression of cytokines, toll-like receptors (TLRs) and  proteins. The results showed the body weight and average daily gain were not significantly different between both groups. Starter feeding significantly (P < 0.05) increased the concentrations of propionate and butyrate; the proportions of acetate, propionate and butyrate to total concentrations of VFA; and decreased the ratio of acetate to propionate in caecal contents. Principal coordinate analysis showed that samples from the M + S group could be distinguished from those from the M group; starter feeding also increased the diversity of caecal mucosal bacteria. At the genus level, starter feeding significantly (FDR < 0.05) increased the relative abundance of Alistipes, Parabacteroides, Parasutterella and Butyricimonas, and caused a decreasing trend (FDR < 0.10) in the relative abundance of Campylobacter and Helicobacter. The real-time PCR results showed that starter feeding significantly (FDR < 0.05) decreased the relative mRNA expression level of IL-12, TNF-α and TLR4 and increased the relative mRNA expression level of claudin-4. These results indicate that starter feeding altered caecal mucosal bacterial communities and decreased the expression of inflammatory factors, which may be beneficial in alleviating the weaning stress of lambs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We found that EGCG displayed increased stability when formulated as dual-drug loaded PEGylated PLGA nanoparticles (EGCG/AA NPs). Oral administration of EGCG/AA NPs in mice resulted in EGCG accumulation in all major organs, including the brain. Pharmacokinetic comparison of plasma and brain accumulation following oral administration of free or EGCG/AA NPs showed that, whilst in both cases initial EGCG concentrations were similar, long-term (5-25 h) concentrations were ca. 5 fold higher with EGCG/AA NPs. No evidence was found that EGCG/AA NPs utilised a specific pathway across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, EGCG, empty NPs and EGCG/AA NPs all induced  disruption and opened the BBB in vitro and ex vivo. Oral treatment of APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice, a familial model of AD, with EGCG/AA NPs resulted in a marked increase in synapses, as judged by synaptophysin (SYP) expression, and reduction of neuroinflammation as well as amyloid β (Aβ) plaque burden and cortical levels of soluble and insoluble Aβ peptide. These morphological changes were accompanied by significantly enhanced spatial learning and memory. Mechanistically, we propose that stabilisation of EGCG in NPs complexes and a destabilized BBB led to higher therapeutic EGCG concentrations in the brain. Thus EGCG/AA NPs have the potential to be developed as a safe and strategy for the treatment of AD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we observed the dynamic effect and potential mechanism of ioversol on the BBB in rats. Eighty-one healthy rats were randomly divided into a normal control group (n = 9), ioversol group (n = 36), and 0.9% NaCl group (n = 36); the latter two groups were separately subdivided into four groups based on time points after treatment (0.5, 3, 6, and 24 h) (n = 9/group). Permeability of the BBB was measured by an Evans Blue (EB) assay. Levels of the  (TJ) proteins ZO-1 and occludin were determined by western blot and immunofluorescence staining. EB content increased at 3 h after the administration of ioversol via the carotid artery and reached a peak at 6 h (P < 0.05), whereas it decreased to its normal level at 24 h. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining indicated that the expression of ZO-1 in brain tissues gradually decreased to its lowest level at 3 h, and then increased gradually, but was still lower than that of the normal control group at 24 h (P < 0.05). Occludin was similar, but its lowest expression appeared at 0.5 h. This study demonstrated that the permeability of BBB in rats increased first and then decreased after ioversol was injected into the carotid artery. The mechanism may be related to altered protein expression of TJs, which are important structures in BBB. Early intervention against TJ proteins may be an effective measure to prevent and treat CIE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30596786>Protective effects of Bacillus probiotics against high-fat diet-induced metabolic disorders in mice.</a></h1><p>Recently, modulation of gut microbiota by probiotics treatment has been emerged as a promising strategy for treatment of metabolic disorders. Apart from lactic  bacteria, Bacillus species (Bacillus spp.) have also been paid attention as potential probiotics, but nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms for their protective effect against metabolic dysfunction remain to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that a probiotic mixture composed of 5 different Bacillus spp. protects mice from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Probiotic Bacillus treatment substantially attenuated body weight gain and enhanced glucose tolerance by sensitizing insulin action in skeletal muscle and epididymal adipose tissue (EAT) of HFD-fed mice. Bacillus-treated HFD-fed mice also exhibited significantly suppressed chronic inflammation in the liver, EAT and skeletal muscle, which was observed to be associated with reduced HFD-induced intestinal permeability and enhanced adiponectin production. Additionally, Bacillus treatment significantly reversed HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. In Bacillus-treated mice, hepatic expression of lipid oxidative genes was significantly increased, and lipid accumulation in subcutaneous and mesenteric adipose tissues were significantly decreased, commensurate with down-regulated expression of genes involved in lipid uptake and lipogenesis. Although, in Bacillus-treated mice, significant alterations in gut microbiota composition was not observed, the enhanced expression of -associated proteins showed a possibility of improving gut barrier function by Bacillus treatment. Our findings provide possible explanations how Bacillus probiotics protect diet-induced obese mice against metabolic disorders, identifying the treatment of probiotic Bacillus as a potential therapeutic approach.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176009>Citric  mitigates soybean meal induced inflammatory response and  disruption by altering TLR signal transduction in the intestine of turbot, Scophthalmus maximus L.</a></h1><p>A 12-week feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effect of citric  on the involvement of TLRs in the soybean meal induced inflammatory response and  disruption in the distal intestine of juvenile turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.). Four isonitrogenous and isolipidic practical diets were formulated: fish meal-based diet (FM); 40% fish meal protein in FM replaced with soybean meal protein (SBM); SBM + 1.5% citric  and SBM + 3% citric . Compared to the FM, diet SBM significantly increased the gene expression of TLRs (TLR2, TLR3, TLR5b, TLR9, TLR21, TLR22) and MyD88, as well as TLR related molecules (NF-κB, IRF-3, p38 and JNK), which were remarkably reduced by dietary citric . Similarly, citric  supplementation in SBM markedly depressed gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ) and pore-forming  protein Claudin-7, and enhanced gene expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-β1 and TJ proteins related to the decrease in paracellular permeability (Claudin-3, Claudin-4, Occludin, Tricellulin and ZO-1). Compared to the SBM, the concentration of IgM and C4 in serum was significantly reduced by dietary citric . In brief, dietary citric  could synchronously inhibit TLRs-dependent inflammatory response regulated by NF-κB and IRF3, as well as cause TLRs-dependent  disruption modulated by p38 and JNK. Therefore, citric  could function on mitigating soybean meal induced enteropathy in the distal intestine of juvenile turbot.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, whether it contributes to I/R-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) injury remains unclear. cilostazol exerts protective effects toward I/R-induced BBB injury, with unclear mechanisms. This study explored the potential role of ER stress in I/R-induced endothelial cell damage and determined whether the therapeutic potential of cilostazol, with respect to I/R-induced endothelial cell damage, is related to inhibition of ER stress. We found that exposing brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3) to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) significantly activated ER stress and diminished the barrier function of cell monolayers; treatment with the ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric  (4-PBA) or cilostazol prevented OGD/R-induced ER stress and preserved barrier function. Furthermore, OGD/R induced the expression and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated NF-κB. These changes were partially reversed by 4-PBA or cilostazol treatment. , 4-PBA or cilostazol significantly attenuated I/R-induced ER stress and ameliorated Evans blue leakage and  loss. These results demonstrate that I/R-induced ER stress participates in BBB disruption. Targeting ER stress could be a useful strategy to protect the BBB from ischemic stroke, and cilostazol is a promising therapeutic agent for this process.-Nan, D., Jin, H., Deng, J., Yu, W., Liu, R., Sun, W., Huang, Y.

In the first part of this study, starting on day 9 of age, the growth performance of the birds fed 3 experimental diets in each phase of feeding (G/F: grower/finisher) was investigated. Three experimental diets were as follows: LP (170/150 g/kg CP) fortified with essential amino  (EAA), standard protein (SP), (202/190 g/kg), and high protein (HP) (220/210 g/kg). LP and SP diets contained a similar level of EAA concentration, while the HP diet contained 10% above the Ross 308 specifications. Each diet was replicated 6 times (10 male birds per replicate). The second part investigated intestinal permeability (IP) and function on additional 72 birds. On days 14, 16, and 20, a total of 36 birds (12 birds per diet) were injected with dexamethasone (DEX) to induce leaky gut. Birds fed LP diets had lower body weight gain (BWG) and higher feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared with SP and HP diets in both grower and finisher phases of feeding. For the challenge part, DEX increased the FCR independent of diets. Diet and DEX interacted for BWG, whereby the effect of diets was only evident in sham-injected birds. Birds fed LP had a higher fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) concentration indicating a more permeable intestine compared to HP, but similar to SP. DEX increased FITC-d concentration in all dietary treatments. Birds fed LP had less ileal zonula occludens-2 (ZO-2) expression in comparison with SP, but not HP. DEX increased the expression of Claudin3 and ZO-2 and reduced Claudin1 (P < 0.05) and junctional adhesion molecule 2 in the ileum. Expression of ileal Na+-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) was upregulated in LP fed group. It is concluded that compared with SP, IP can be maintained in LP by supplementing EAA. However, when compared with HP, feeding birds with LP may lead to a higher IP. DEX had a profound independent effect on intestinal barrier function.© 2018 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741300>Food-borne patulin toxicity is related to gut barrier disruption and can be prevented by docosahexaenoic  and probiotic supplementation.</a></h1><p>Patulin (PAT) is a mycotoxin widely found in fruits and vegetables. Several reviews and studies have hypothesized that in vivo PAT toxicity is related to gut barrier dysfunction, but evidence for this is not substantial. The goal of the present study was to further demonstrate the role of the gut barrier in food-borne PAT toxicity. In vitro assays showed that PAT exposure induced significant cell death, inhibited the mRNA expressions of  proteins and increased gut permeability in Caco-2 cell monolayers. An acute PAT exposure animal trial reported for the first time an association between PAT-induced disruption of the gut barrier and endotoxemia in mice. Sub-chronic PAT exposure also inhibited the expression of ZO-1 in the gut and induced both intestinal and systematic inflammation in mice. Dietary supplements with previously reported protective effects on the gut barrier, such as docosahexaenoic  and Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8610, were able to recover the PAT-induced gut barrier dysfunction and significantly alleviate PAT toxicity in vivo. Another L. plantarum strain, CCFM11, with poor gut barrier modulation ability, failed to exhibit identical protective effects against PAT toxicity to L. plantarum CCFM8610. Our results indicated that PAT-induced disruption of the gut barrier and bacterial translocation may be another toxic mechanism of PAT besides its inherent cytotoxicity. Gut barrier protection may be considered an important target for the prevention of PAT toxicity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650454>Ghrelin alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammation-mediated reproductive dysfunction induced by stress.</a></h1><p>Psychological stress exists widely in modern society and results in the disruption of testicular , germ cell apoptosis, and the disorder of fertility hormones and even causes infertility. Ghrelin (GHRL), a 28-amino  peptide secreted mainly by the stomach and pancreas, has been reported to alleviate male reproductive injury through inhibiting apoptosis. However, whether GHRL has a beneficial effect on psychological stress-induced testicular injury and the possible mechanisms remain poorly understood.Male mice were immobilized in Decapicone bags for 3 h daily for 14 days treated with or without GHRL (i.p. 100 mg/kg body weight). Body weight and testicular weight were measured. Histological alterations and apoptosis were examined by H.E. staining and TUNEL staining, respectively. The expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers, inflammatory cytokines, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in the testes was investigated.Exposure to stress caused testicular histological alterations, an elevation of the Johnsen score, and germ cell apoptosis, while GHRL partially alleviated the adverse effects. The expression of ER stress marker proteins, including GRP78, CHOP, ATF6, p-JNK, and XBP-1, was upregulated in the stress group; however, GHRL treatment significantly suppressed the activation of ER stress in the testes. GHRL also inhibited the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TLR4, and NF-κB.GHRL alleviated testicular injury induced by ER stress and inflammation which is associated with the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, and these findings may provide a novel strategy for preventing and treating reproductive dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30453554>Dichloromethane Extracts of  Kom.

Therefore, it is necessary to study the improvement of esophageal damage on a RE-induced model. The present study was accomplished to demonstrate the protective effects of a dichloromethane fraction of  (DGK) plant on esophageal damage in an acute RE rat model. First, we examined the potential of anti-inflammatory effects of various fractions measured by cell cytotoxicity, morphological changes and nitric oxide (NO) production on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced Raw 264.7 macrophage cells. Then, to evaluate the protective effects on RE, rats were partitioned into the following groups: normal control, RE-induced control and RE rats pre-treated with DGK 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight. The esophageal mucosal ulcer ratio was measured by the Image J program and histological changes were examined using a hematoxylin and eosin staining of the esophageal mucosa. The expression of pro-inflammatory proteins, cytokines and  proteins involved in the esophageal mucosal damage were investigated using Western blotting and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit with esophagus tissue. DGK chemical profile and phenolic contents were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The results showed that DGK exhibited anti-inflammatory effects against LPS-stimulated cells by significantly inhibiting NO production. Additionally, the results in vivo showed that improvement effects of DGK on esophageal mucosal damage. The expression of inflammatory proteins involved in nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways and  protein (claudin-4 and -5) were significantly decreased in esophageal mucosa.

Here, we investigated the dynamic changes of rumen fermentation and bacterial communities following RT and its beneficial effects on rumen epithelial morphology and function in a sheep model of rumen acidosis. The results showed that RT resulted in dynamic changes in rumen fermentation and increased the concentrations of total volatile fatty , acetate, propionate, and butyrate, but it decreased the levels of lactate and LPS in the rumen. Illumina MiSeq Sequencing data showed that RT facilitated rapid rebuilt of ruminal bacterial homeostasis (8 d in control  2 d in RT) from a markedly dysbiotic acidosis state to a healthy level (similar with those of donors). At the genus level, RT increased the relative abundance of unclassified , unclassified , unclassified , and . Additionally, RT also accelerated recovery of the predicted metagenomic function of ruminal bacteria. Rumen papillae morphology results showed that RT alleviated the damage of rumen epithelia induced by acute rumen acidosis and increased the length of rumen papillae. Furthermore, real-time PCR results showed that RT modulated mRNA expression of genes related to cytokines and  in the rumen epithelia. In summary, these results reveal that RT accelerates recovery of rumen fermentation and bacterial homeostasis and modulates rumen epithelial morphology and function for sheep suffering from rumen acidosis.-Liu, J., Li, H., Zhu, W., Mao, S.

After performing postdoctoral research in USA, the author became a research associate at Prof. Yoshiharu Miura's lab and started research on Biochemical Engineering in 1984. At that time, the main research purpose was to solve global environmental issues for maintaining human health. The author's achievements included novel useful material production system under inorganic conditions and genetically engineered whole-cell bacterial sensors detecting arsenite by naked eye without a detecting device. Another theme in the lab was to construct bioartificial liver support system. Various scaffolds for hepatocytes were newly prepared for constructing the compact reactor. Besides the bioreactor study, the author conducted cell transplantation research for the treatment of chronic liver diseases. It was shown that mesenchymal stem cells derived from third molars (wisdom teeth) could differentiate into hepatocytes and exhibit therapeutic effects in liver-damaged animals. After 2006, the lab started research on drug delivery systems, including noninvasive delivery of drugs such as peptides and nucleic  by regulating epithelial . Many substances enabling drug delivery through "paracellular" route were newly prepared. The author started basic research on Biochemical Engineering in the 1970s. Although these studies eventually shifted into the pharmaceutical field, the underlying concept was based on "engineering" throughout a 40-year research period.

The B cell epitopes of murine TNF‑α (mTNF‑α) were predicted in silico and coupled with the universal interleukin 1β (IL‑1β) helper T‑cell epitope peptide VQGEESNDK to synthesize the eight‑branched MAP vaccine. Then, the immunological effects of the MAP vaccine were assessed in vitro and in vivo, as well as its impacts on DAI index, serum DAO levels, colon tissue  protein amounts, ultrastructural changes, and MPO activity in BALB/c mice with UC. The amino  LTLRSSSQNSSDKPV at positions 78‑92 of mTNF‑α may constitute the dominant B cell epitope. Based on this finding, an eight‑branched peptide structure, the TNF‑α B‑cell epitope/IL‑1β helper T‑cell epitope complex MAP vaccine, was synthesized. Indirect ELISA confirmed that MAP had a high affinity with commercialized mTNF‑α antibodies. Meanwhile, MAP induced high specific antibody titers in vivo, reduced the DAI score, serum MPO activity, colorectal lymph node colony count, ultrastructural injuries, colon tissue histological index score and MPO activity in UC mice, while increasing the expression levels of occludin, claudin1 and ZO1 in colon tissues.

Microbial products, such as the short-chain fatty  butyrate, can have positive effects on wound healing. We used an in vitro model of T84 colonic epithelial cells to determine if the Snail genes Slug () and Snail (), implemented in keratinocyte monolayer healing, are involved in butyrate-enhanced colonic epithelial wound healing. Using shRNA-mediated Slug/Snail knockdown, we found that knockdown of Slug (Slug-KD), but not Snail (Snail-KD), impairs wound healing in scratch assays with and without butyrate. Slug and Snail had differential effects on T84 monolayer barrier integrity, measured by transepithelial resistance, as Snail-KD impaired the barrier (with or without butyrate), whereas Slug-KD enhanced the barrier, again with or without butyrate. Targeted transcriptional analysis demonstrated differential expression of several  genes, as well as focal adhesion genes. This included altered regulation of Annexin A2 and ITGB1 in Slug-KD, which was reflected in confocal microscopy, showing increased accumulation of B1-integrin protein in Slug-KD cells, which was previously shown to impair wound healing. Transcriptional analysis also indicated altered expression of genes associated with epithelial terminal differentiation, such that Slug-KD cells skewed toward overexpression of secretory cell pathway-associated genes. This included trefoil factors TFF1 and TFF3, which were expressed at lower than control levels in Snail-KD cells. Since TFFs can enhance the barrier in epithelial cells, this points to a potential mechanism of differential modulation by Snail genes. Although Snail genes are crucial in epithelial wound restitution, butyrate responses are mediated by other pathways as well. Although butyrate can promote colonic mucosal healing, not all of its downstream pathways are understood. We show that the Snail genes Snail and Slug are mediators of butyrate responses. Furthermore, these genes, and Slug in particular, are necessary for efficient restitution of wounds and barriers in T84 epithelial cells even in the absence of butyrate. These effects are achieved in part through effects on regulation of β1 integrin and cellular differentiation state.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035684>The Possible Role of the Microbiota-Gut-Brain-Axis in Autism Spectrum Disorder.</a></h1><p>New research points to a possible link between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the gut microbiota as many autistic children have co-occurring gastrointestinal problems. This review focuses on specific alterations of gut microbiota mostly observed in autistic patients. Particularly, the mechanisms through which such alterations may trigger the production of the bacterial metabolites, or leaky gut in autistic people are described. Various altered metabolite levels were observed in the blood and urine of autistic children, many of which were of bacterial origin such as short chain fatty  (SCFAs), indoles and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). A less integrative gut-blood-barrier is abundant in autistic individuals. This explains the leakage of bacterial metabolites into the patients, triggering new body responses or an altered metabolism. Some other co-occurring symptoms such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress in cells, altered  in the blood-brain barrier and structural changes in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and cerebellum were also detected. Moreover, this paper suggests that ASD is associated with an unbalanced gut microbiota (dysbiosis). Although the cause-effect relationship between ASD and gut microbiota is not yet well established, the consumption of specific probiotics may represent a side-effect free tool to re-establish gut homeostasis and promote gut health. The diagnostic and therapeutic value of bacterial-derived compounds as new possible biomarkers, associated with perturbation in the phenylalanine metabolism, as well as potential therapeutic strategies will be discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411504>High-fat diet promotes experimental colitis by inducing oxidative stress in the colon.</a></h1><p>Diets high in animal fats are associated with increased risks of inflammatory bowel disease, but the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on the development of experimental colitis in mice. Relative to mice fed low-fat diet (LFD), HFD feeding for 4 wk increased the levels of triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty  in the plasma as well as within the colonic mucosa. In an experimental colitis model induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS), mice on 4-wk HFD exhibited more severe colonic inflammation and developed more severe colitis compared with the LFD counterparts. HFD feeding resulted in higher production of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokines, greater activation of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)  regulatory pathway, and greater increases in mucosal barrier permeability in mice following TNBS induction. HFD feeding also induced gp91, an NADPH oxidase subunit, and promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in both colonic epithelial cells and lamina propria cells. In HCT116 cell culture, palmitic  or palmitic  and TNF-α combination markedly increased ROS production and induced the MLCK pathway, and these effects were markedly diminished in the presence of a ROS scavenger. Taken together, these data suggest that HFD promotes colitis by aggravating mucosal oxidative stress, which rapidly drives mucosal inflammation and increases intestinal mucosal barrier permeability. This study demonstrates high-fat diet feeding promotes colitis in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic -induced experimental colitis model in mice. The underlying mechanism is that high-fat diet induces oxidative stress in the colonic mucosa, which increases colonic epithelial barrier permeability and drives colonic mucosal inflammation. These observations provide molecular evidence that diets high in saturated fats are detrimental to patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592143>Distinct Origin of Claudin7 in Early Tumor Endosomes Affects Exosome Assembly.</a></h1><p>Microvesicles are the body's most powerful intercellular communication system and cancer-initiating cell microvesicles (CIC-TEX) reprogram Non-CIC towards fortified malignancy. Claudin7, a CIC-biomarker in gastrointestinal tumors, is recovered in TEX. Recent evidence suggesting individual cells delivering distinct microvesicles became of particular interest for claudin7, which is part of  (TJ) and glycolipid-enriched membrane domains (GEM), GEM-located claudin7 is palmitoylated. This offered the unique possibility of exploring the contribution of a CIC marker and its origin from distinct membrane domains on CIC-TEX biogenesis and activities. Proteome and miRNA analysis of wild-type, claudin7-knockdown and a rescue with claudin7 harboring a mutated palmitoylation site (mP) of a rat pancreatic and a human colon cancer line uncovered significant, only partly overlapping contributions of palmitoylated and non-palmitoylated claudin7 to TEX composition. Palmitoylated claudin7 facilitates GEM-integrated plasma membrane and associated signaling molecule recruitment; non-palmitoylated claudin7 supports recruitment of trafficking components, proteins engaged in fatty  metabolism and TJ proteins into TEX. Claudin7mP also assists TEX recovery of selected miRNA. Thus, distinctly located claudin7 affects CIC-TEX composition and TJ-derived cld7 might play a unique role in equipping CIC-TEX with transporters and lipid metabolism-regulating molecules, awareness of distinct TEX populations being crucial facing therapeutic translation.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542404>Enhancement of epithelial cell autophagy induced by sinensetin alleviates epithelial barrier dysfunction in colitis.</a></h1><p>Intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction is a key pathology of colitis. Autophagy of epithelial cells maintains homeostasis of the intestinal barrier by inhibiting apoptosis and stimulating degradation of the  protein claudin-2. This study investigated the effects and mechanism of activity of sinensetin, a polymethylated flavonoid isolated from tangerine peel and citrus, on intestinal barrier dysfunction in colitis. Animal model of colitis were established by intracolonic administration of 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  and oral treatment with dextran sulfate sodium. Epithelial barrier function was evaluated by measuring the serum recovery of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-4 kD dextran in vivo and transepithelial electrical resistance in Caco-2 cells, respectively. Epithelial cell autophagy assayed by autophagosome formation and expression of autophagy-related protein. Sinensetin reversed colitis-associated increase in intestinal permeability, significantly promoted epithelial cell autophagy, and further decreased epithelial cell apoptosis, and reduced mucosal claudin-2. Sinenstetin alleviated colitis symptoms rats and mice with colitis. Knockdown of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) reversed the promotion of epithelial autophagy by sinensetin. In conclusion, sinensetin significantly alleviated intestinal barrier dysfunction in colitis by promoting epithelial cell autophagy, and further inhibiting apoptosis and promoting claudin-2 degradation. The results highlighted novel potential benefits of sinensetin in colitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into 3 groups, including normal control (NC) group,  model (HP) group, and SC prevention (HP+SC) group.  infection mouse model was established by gavage with  Sydney strain (SS1). And HP+SC group was also administered with SC for 14 days. After mice were sacrificed, the gastric mucosa was taken for HE staining, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining [, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), Occludin, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)], qPCR (IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α) . And cell ultrastructure was observed by electron microscopy. Microbiota communities in the gastric mucosa or fecal were investigated using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing. The detection of  in IHC staining or Giemsa staining was defined as  infection.  The  positive rate of HP group was 91.67%, and that of HP+SC group was 50.00%. The EDS of HP group were significantly higher than those of the NC group [(3.42±0.19) vs (1.17±0.17), 0.05], while EDS of HP+SC group (2.42±0.29) were significantly lower than that of HP group (0.05). The mRNA levels and immunostaining scores of IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α in HP group was higher than NC group (all 0.05). Compared with HP group, mRNA levels and IHC scores of IL-8 significantly decreased (all 0.05) in HP+SC group, while those of IL-10 and TNF-α was similar between two groups (all 0.05). The IHC scores of ZO-1 and Occludin in HP group was significantly lower than NC group (all 0.05), and that of ZO-1 and Occludin in the HP+SC group increased compared with HP group [(2.00±0.26) vs (1.17±0.48), 0.05; (3.50±0.43) vs (2.33±0.21), 0.05]. Compared with NC group, the diversity of gastric microbiota in HP group was significantly lower, and diversity of gut microbiota decreased insignificantly. There was no significant difference between HP+SC group and HP group in gastric or gut microbiota.  SC reduces  colonization, protects -induced gastric mucosal injury, decreases -induced IL-8 expression, enhances Occludin.

The aim of this work was twofold: 1) to investigate the structural and functional alterations of the  (TJ)-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier of ileum and colon, that concentrate most of the microbiota, after exposure to a HFD for 15, 30 and 60 days, and 2) to assess the effect of in vitro exposure to free fatty  (FFAs), one of the components of HFD, on paracellular barrier of colon-derived Caco-2 cells.HFD exposure induced progressive metabolic changes in male mice that culminated in prediabetes after 60d. Morphological analysis of ileum and colon mucosa showed no signs of epithelial rupture or local inflammation but changes in the junctional content/distribution and/or cellular content of TJ-associated proteins (claudins-1, -2, -3, and occludin) in intestinal epithelia were seen mainly after a prediabetes state has been established. This impairment in TJ structure was not associated with significant changes in intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran. Exposure of Caco-2 monolayers to palmitic or linoleic  seems to induce a reinforcement of TJ structure while treatment with oleic  had a more diverse effect on TJ protein distribution.TJ structure in distal intestinal epithelia can be specifically impaired by HFD intake at early stage of T2DM, but not by FFAs in vitro. Since the TJ change in ileum/colon was marginal, probably it does not contribute to the disease onset.Copyright © 2019.

Current treatments rely upon donor allogeneic tissue to replace the damaged CE. A donor cornea shortage necessitates the development of biomaterials, enabling in vitro expansion of corneal endothelial cells (CECs). This study investigated the use of a synthetic peptide hydrogel using poly-ε-lysine (pεK), cross-linked with octanedioic- as a potential substrate for CECs expansion and CE grafts. PεK hydrogel properties were optimised to produce a substrate which was thin, transparent, porous and robust. A human corneal endothelial cell line (HCEC-12) attached and grew on pεK hydrogels as confluent monolayers after 7 days, whereas primary porcine CECs (pCECs) detached from the pεK hydrogel. Pre-adsorption of collagen I, collagen IV and fibronectin to the pεK hydrogel increased pCEC adhesion at 24 h and confluent monolayers formed at 7 days. Minimal cell adhesion was observed with pre-adsorbed laminin, chondroitin sulphate or commercial FNC coating mix (fibronectin, collagen and albumin). Functionalisation of the pεK hydrogel with synthetic cell binding peptide H-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Gly-Gly-OH (RGD) or α2β1 integrin recognition sequence H-Asp-Gly-Glu-Ala-OH (DGEA) resulted in enhanced pCEC adhesion with the RGD peptide only. pCECs grown in culture at 5 weeks on RGD pεK hydrogels showed zonula occludins 1 staining for  and expression of sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphase, suggesting a functional CE. These results demonstrate the pεK hydrogel can be tailored through covalent binding of RGD to provide a surface for CEC attachment and growth. Thus, providing a synthetic substrate with a therapeutic application for the expansion of allogenic CECs and replacement of damaged CE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30871183>Intestinal Anti-Inflammatory Effect of a Peptide Derived from Gastrointestinal Digestion of Buffalo () Mozzarella Cheese.</a></h1><p>Under physiological conditions, the small intestine represents a barrier against harmful antigens and pathogens. Maintaining of the intestinal barrier depends largely on cell⁻cell interactions (adherent-) and cell⁻matrix interactions (). Inflammatory bowel disease is characterized by chronic inflammation, which induces a destructuring of the architecture junctional epithelial proteins with consequent rupture of the intestinal barrier. Recently, a peptide identified by  milk-derived products (MBCP) has been able to reduce oxidative stress in intestinal epithelial cells and erythrocytes. Our aim was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of MBCP in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We studied the effect of MBCP on (i) inflamed human intestinal Caco2 cells and (ii) dinitrobenzene sulfonic  (DNBS) mice model of colitis. We have shown that MBCP, at non-cytotoxic concentrations, both  and  induced the adherent epithelial  organization, modulated the nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway and reduced the intestinal permeability.

The protective effects of thymol on pig intestine during inflammation is yet to be investigated. In this study, an in vitro lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation model using IPEC-J2 cells was established. Cells were pretreated with thymol for 1 h and then exposed to LPS for various assays. Interleukin 8 (IL-8) secretion, the mRNA abundance of cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nutrient transporters, and  proteins was measured. The results showed that LPS stimulation increased IL-8 secretion, ROS production, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) mRNA abundance ( P < 0.05), but the mRNA abundance of sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1), excitatory amino  transporter 1 (EAAC1), and H/peptide cotransporter 1 (PepT1) were decreased ( P < 0.05). Thymol blocked ROS production ( P < 0.05) and tended to decrease the production of LPS-induced IL-8 secretion ( P = 0.0766). The mRNA abundance of IL-8 and TNF-α was reduced by thymol pretreatment ( P < 0.05), but thymol did not improve the gene expression of nutrient transporters ( P > 0.05). The transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was reduced and cell permeability increased by LPS treatment ( P < 0.05), but these effects were attenuated by thymol ( P < 0.05). Moreover, thymol increased zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and actin staining in the cells. However, the mRNA abundance of ZO-1 and occludin-3 was not affected by either LPS or thymol treatments. These results indicated that thymol enhances barrier function and reduce ROS production and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in the epithelial cells during inflammation. The regulation of barrier function by thymol and LPS may be at post-transcriptional or post-translational levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706920>Protective effect of biogenic polyphosphate nanoparticles from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 on dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis in mice.</a></h1><p>Biogenic polyphosphate nanoparticles (BPNPs) from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 have been found to exhibit intestinal protective potential in vitro and ex vivo. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vivo intestinal protective effect of BPNPs in experimental colitis. BPNPs were intragastrically administered to C57BL/6 mice daily for 9 d during and after 5 d dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) exposure. Based on the body weight, disease activity index, colon length and colon histology, BPNPs effectively ameliorated DSS-induced colitis in mice. According to colonic myeloperoxidase activity, colonic and peripheral proinflammatory cytokines, and hematological parameters, BPNPs alleviated the DSS-induced colonic and systemic inflammation. BPNPs enhanced the intestinal barrier function by upregulating the colonic expressions of heat shock protein 25 and  proteins. By high-throughput sequencing of fecal 16S rRNA, BPNPs were found to maintain gut microbial homeostasis in colitis mice. Overall, BPNPs have a considerable in vivo efficacy to maintain gut health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662792>Transcribed ultraconserved region (T-UCR) uc.261 expression is closely correlated with disease activity and intestinal permeability in Crohn's disease.</a></h1><p>Transcribed ultraconserved region (T-UCR) uc.261 is reported to participate in intestinal mucosa barrier damage in Crohn's disease (CD).

This study is the first to investigate TRF through a surgical perspective verifying its efficacy against liver ischaemia reperfusion (I/R) injury. We randomly assigned 100 10-week-old wild-type male C57BL/6 mice into two feeding regimens: TRF and ad libitum access to food. Main outcomes were evaluated at 6, 12 and 24 hours post-I/R surgery after 12 weeks of intervention. TRF group demonstrated minor liver injury via histological study; lower serum levels of liver enzymes, glucose and lipids; higher concentrations of free fatty  and β-hydroxybutyrate; decreased oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers; as well as less severe cell apoptosis and proliferation. Further exploration indicated better gut microenvironment and intestinal epithelial  function. TRF employed its positive influence on a wide spectrum of biochemical pathways and ultimately revealed protective effect against hepatic I/R injury possibly through adjusting the gut microbiota.

Previous study indicated that Dendrobium officinale polysaccharides (DOPS) can regulate immune responses and inflammation to alleviate experimental colitis. However, it remains largely unknown whether DOPS can suppress AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer (CRC) model through its direct impact on intestinal barrier function and intestinal mucosal immunity. Here, we demonstrated the therapeutic action of DOPS for CRC model and further illustrated its underlying mechanisms. Treatment with 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) and DOPS significantly improved the clinical signs and symptoms of chronic colitis, relieve colon damage, suppress the formation and growth of colon tumor in CRC mice. Moreover, administration of DOPS effectively preserved the intestinal barrier function via reducing the loss of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin in adjacent tissues and carcinomatous tissues. Further studies demonstrated that DOPS improved the metabolic ability of tumor infiltrated CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and reduced the expression of PD-1 on CTLs to enhance the anti-tumor immune response in the tumor microenvironments (TME). Together, the conclusions indicated that DOPS restore intestinal barrier function and enhance intestinal anti-tumor immune response to suppress CRC, which may be a novel strategy for the prevention and treatment of CRC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Mice were orally given Crotonis Fructus. The content of DAO and D-lactic  in the serum were measured by ELISA to investigate the change of intestinal permeability in mice. Western blot was used to determine the expressions of  proteins (occludin, claudin-1) in different intestinal tract, so as to observe the effect of Crotonis Fructus and its processed products on intestinal epithelial barrier. These results showed that Crotonis Fructus could significantly increase the intestinal permeability and reduce the expression of  proteins in duodenum and jejunum, but with little impact on the ileum and colon. The intestinal permeability and the expression of  proteins became normal after processing. However, the order of the toxicity of Crotonis Semen Pulveratum from high to low was non-heat Crotonis Semen Pulveratum > diluted Crotonis Semen Pulveratum≈4heat Crotonis Semen Pulveratum. According to the results of composition, the composition of fatty oil did not change during the processing, but the content and composition of total protein in Crotonis Semen Pulveratum changed significantly. The order of total protein content from high to low was that non-heat Crotonis Semen Pulveratum > heat Crotonis Semen Pulveratum > diluted Crotonis Semen Pulveratum. The molecular weight distribution of the total protein bands of non-heat Crotonis Semen Pulveratum and diluted Crotonis Semen Pulveratum was consistent, but the composition of total protein of heat Crotonis Semen Pulveratum significantly changed as evidenced by decreased and thin some stripes. This indicated that heating and dilution could reduce the content of total protein, and heating could cause partial protein denaturation and inactivation. In conclusion, both dilution and heating can reduce the toxicity of Crotonis Fructus, but the heating shows a more significant attenuation effect, indicating that heating is the key step in Crotonis Semen Pulveratum preparation.Copyright© by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31390532>Chlorogenic  attenuates cadmium-induced intestinal injury in Sprague-Dawley rats.</a></h1><p>Chronic exposure to cadmium (Cd) causes remarkable damage to the liver and gastrointestinal tract. Previous studies have revealed that chlorogenic  (CGA) could improve the intestinal barrier integrity for weaned rats. Hence, this study sought to investigate the protective effects of CGA from pure reagent and sunflower seed extract (SSE) on growth performance, antioxidant indicators, inflammatory biomarkers and intestinal barrier function in Cd treated rats. A total of 32 Sprague-Dawley female rats with similar weights were randomly allotted to four treatments: control, CdCl (6 mg/kg BW), co-treatment of Cd (6 mg/kg BW) and pure CGA (50 mg/kg BW), and co-treatment of Cd (6 mg/kg BW) and SSE (50 mg/kg BW) for 14 days. The data indicated that, CGA or SSE with Cd sequestration and good antioxidative ability decreased Cd absorption and accumulation in the jejunum and increased fecal Cd levels in Cd-exposed rats. Compared with the Cd group, co-treatment with CGA or SSE also alleviated inflammation, ameliorated the villus damage, reversed the disruption of , and recovered weight gain of rats. These results suggest that CGA or SSE can protect the intestinal barrier, which is related to the alleviation of Cd-induced oxidative stress and growth decrease.Copyright © 2019.
