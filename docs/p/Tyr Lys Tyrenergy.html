<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28657434>Quick elucidation of cyclodepsipeptide sequence from sacoglossan Elysia grandifolia using electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h1><p>Butanol fraction of sacoglossan Elysia grandifolia was investigated for identifying peptides using electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). Without prior isolation, the structural determination is achieved on the basis of mass fragmentation pattern and comparison with the previously established data. The ESI-MS of the fraction in the positive ion mode gave clusters of singly and doubly charged molecular ion peaks. The ESI-MS spectrum showed peaks for the presence of the peptides kahalalides F, G, R and S reported earlier. In addition, it also showed molecular ion peaks at m/z 1557.8 [M+H] and doubly charged ions at m/z 779.4 [M+2H], 790.4 [M+Na] and 796.4 [M+K]. The MS/MS at m/z 779.4 [M+2H] at collision  40 V obtained series of b and y fragment ions. The MS/MS spectrum showed identical fragment ion y at m/z 643 which revealed that cyclic part is identical with kahalalide F, R and S. Careful examination of the fragment ions b to b with their corresponding y fragment ions y to y, respectively and by comparison of MS/MS pattern of kahalalide S, established that proline can be replaced by tyrosine amino acid residue. The mass difference between b ( m/z 511) and b ( m/z 674) is equal to 163 which is equivalent to mass residue of tyrosine. Their y fragment ions also quickly helped in fixing the puzzle. This resulted in the identification of the peptide sequence cyclo-[Val-(5-MeHex-Val-Thr-Val-Val--Ile)Thr-Ile-Val-Phe-Dhb)] for the new cyclodepsipeptide, kahalalide Z. Thus, ESI-MS/MS has set a trend in quick identification of new marine molecules.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27743211>Evaluation of a Flexible NOTA-RGD Kit Solution Using Gallium-68 from Different Ge/Ga-Generators: Pharmacokinetics and Biodistribution in Nonhuman Primates and Demonstration of Solitary Pulmonary Nodule Imaging in Humans.</a></h1><p>Radiopharmaceuticals containing the motive tripeptide arginyl-glycyl-asparatic acid (RGD) are known to target ανβ3 integrins during tumor angiogenesis. A more generic kit radiolabeling procedure accommodating Ga-68 from different generators was developed for NOTA-RGD and evaluated for its versatile use and safety in subsequent in vivo applications. The [Ga]NOTA-RGD kit was further verified for its expected biodistribution and pharmacokinetics in nonhuman primates and its clinical sensitivity to detect solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) in cancer patients.Single vial kits containing 28-56 nmol of NOTA-cyclo-Arg-Gly-Asp-d- (NOTA-RGD) and sodium acetate trihydrate buffer were formulated. Versatility of the NOTA-RGD radiolabeling performance and adaption to a TiO- and a SnO-based generator type, characterization and long-term storage stability of the kits were carried out. The blood clearance and urine recovery kinetics as well as the image-guided biodistribution of [Ga]NOTA-RGD was studied in a vervet monkey model. [Ga]NOTA-RGD kits were further tested clinically to target solitary pulmonary nodules.The kits could be successfully formulated warranting integrity over 3-4 months with a good [Ga]NOTA-RGD radiolabeling performance (radiochemical purity >95 %, decay corrected yield 76-94 %, specific activity of 8.8-37.9 GBq/μmol) The kits met all quality requirements to be further tested in vivo. [Ga]NOTA-RGD cleared rapidly from blood and was majorly excreted via the renal route. The liver, spleen, heart and intestines showed initial uptake with steadily declining tissue activity concentration over time. In addition, the [Ga]NOTA-RGD kit allowed for delineation of SPN from non-malignant lung tissue in humans.A more versatile radiolabeling procedure using kit-formulated NOTA-RGD and different generator types was achieved. The uncompromised in vivo behavior and efficient targeting of SPN warrants further investigations on the clinical relevance of [Ga]NOTA-RGD derivatives to implement initial guidelines and management of patients, with regard to integrin targeted imaging.</p></html>
