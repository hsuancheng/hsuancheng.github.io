However, a major limitation to their widespread use is represented by neurotoxicity that leads to peripheral neuropathy. In this study we evaluated the roles of a proven immunotherapeutic agent [Gc-protein-derived macrophage activating factor (GcMAF)] in preventing or decreasing oxaliplatin-induced neuronal damage and in modulating microglia activation following oxaliplatin-induced damage. The effects of oxaliplatin and of a commercially available formula of GcMAF [-GcMAF (OA-GcMAF)] were studied in human neurons (SH-SY5Y cells) and in human microglial cells (C13NJ). Cell density, morphology and viability, as well as production of cAMP and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), markers of neuron regeneration [neuromodulin or growth associated protein-43 (Gap-43)] and markers of microglia activation [ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) and B7-2], were determined. OA-GcMAF reverted the damage inflicted by oxaliplatin on human neurons and preserved their viability. The neuroprotective effect was accompanied by increased intracellular cAMP production, as well as by increased expression of VEGF and neuromodulin. OA-GcMAF did not revert the effects of oxaliplatin on microglial cell viability. However, it increased microglial activation following oxaliplatin-induced damage, resulting in an increased expression of the markers Iba1 and B7-2 without any concomitant increase in cell number. When neurons and microglial cells were co-cultured, the presence of OA-GcMAF significantly counteracted the toxic effects of oxaliplatin. Our results demonstrate that OA-GcMAF, already used in the  of advanced cancers, may significantly contribute to neutralizing the neurotoxicity induced by oxaliplatin, at the same time possibly concurring to an integrated anticancer effect. The association between these two powerful anticancer molecules would probably produce the dual effect of reduction of oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity, together with possible synergism in the overall anticancer effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27262314>Apricot Kernel Oil Ameliorates Cyclophosphamide-Associated Immunosuppression in Rats.</a></h2><p>The effects of dietary apricot kernel oil (AKO), which contains high levels of  and linoleic acids and lower levels of α-tocopherol, were evaluated in a rat model of cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression. Rats had intraperitoneal injection with cyclophosphamide to induce immunosuppression and were then infused with AKO or normal saline (NS) for 4 weeks. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to detect antimicrobial factors in lymphocytes and anti-inflammatory factors in hepatocytes. Hematoxylin & eosin staining was conducted prior to histopathological analysis of the spleen, liver, and thymus. Significant differences were observed between the immune functions of the healthy control group, the normal saline group, and the AKO group. Compared to the normal saline-treated group, lymphocytes isolated from rats administered AKO showed significant improvement in immunoglobulin (Ig)A, IgM, IgG, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels (p < 0.01). Liver tissue levels of malondialdehyde and activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase indicated reduced oxidative stress in rats treated with AKO (p < 0.01). Dietary AKO positively affected rat growth and inhibited cyclophosphamide-associated organ degeneration. These results suggested that AKO may enhance the immune system in vivo. These effects may reflect the activities of intermediate  and linoleic  metabolites, which play a vital role in the immune system, and the α-tocopherol in AKO may further enhance this phenomenon. Thus, the use of AKO as a nutritional supplement can be proposed to ameliorate chemotherapy-associated immunosuppression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25443969>Immune-spaying as an alternative to surgical spaying in Iberian×Duroc females: effect on carcass traits and meat quality characteristics.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to assess the effect of immune-spaying on production traits and meat quality characteristics of fresh loin (longissimus dorsi) by comparing 3 groups of Iberian×Duroc females (N=12 per batch): surgically spayed, immune-spayed and entire females. Carcass traits and physicochemical parameters, including fatty  profile, were investigated. The only carcass trait significantly affected by castration was the ham fat thickness, where both immune-spayed and surgically spayed females showed higher values against entire females (57±9.5mm, 62±2.5mm and 51±10.1mm, respectively; p<0.05). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the quality parameters of fresh meat. These results are important regarding animal welfare, since in Europe, there is a plan to voluntarily end the surgical castration of pigs by 2018. Therefore, with an adequate vaccination protocol, immune-spaying might represent a good alternative to surgical spaying. The reliability of immune-spaying over long periods should be evaluated.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Studying the changes of metabolites caused by bone marrow depression can provide insights for the diagnosis of bone marrow suppression disease and for the development of drug therapy. Male BalB/C mice were injected with cyclophosphamide to establish a bone marrow suppression model. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with fingerprinting was used to analyze the normal and model mice blood metabolites. Principal component analysis and orthogonal to partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) on metabolomics for data multidimensional statistical analysis was also used. Compared to the normal group in terms of the metabolic profile of bone marrow suppression mice, there were 15 endogenous metabolites in mouse plasma, nine of which were statistically significantly different, including glucose-1-phosphate, 4-nitrophenol, acetanilide, cortisone, nicotinamide, loganin, caffeic , linoleic  and  (<0.05). These results indicate that metabolite can be used as an important marker in bone marrow suppression, which can help to reveal the pathogenesis of bone marrow suppression induced by chemotherapy and determine the disease development stage and the effectiveness of follow-up treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28404797>Self-adjuvanting C18 lipid vinil sulfone-PP2A vaccine: study of the induced immunomodulation against  infection.</a></h2><p>Despite the importance of the adjuvant in the immunization process, very few adjuvants merge with the antigens in vaccines. A synthetic self-adjuvant -vinyl sulfone (OVS) linked to the catalytic region of recombinant serine/threonine phosphatase 2A from the nematode  (rPP2A) was used for intranasal immunization in mice previously infected with  The animal intranasal immunization with rPP2A-OVS showed a reduction of 99.01% in the number of the nematode eggs and 97.90% in adult. The immunohistochemical analysis of the intestinal sections showed that in immunized animals with lipopeptide the mucus was significantly higher than in the other experimental groups. Also, these animals presented significantly different chemokine, CCL20 and CCL11, levels. However, although the number and size of Tuft cells did not vary between groups, the intensity of fluorescence per cell was significant in the group immunized with the rPP2A-OVS. The results of the present study suggest that mice immunized with the lipopeptide are capable of activating a combined Th17/Th9 response. This strategy of immunization may be of great applicability not only in  and immunoprophylaxis to control diseases caused by nematodes but also in pathologies necessitating action at the level of the Th9 response in the intestinal mucosa.© 2017 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27515218>Is chondroitin sulfate responsible for the biological effects attributed to the GC protein-derived Macrophage Activating Factor (GcMAF)?</a></h2><p>We hypothesize that a plasma glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, may be responsible for the biological and clinical effects attributed to the Gc protein-derived Macrophage Activating Factor (GcMAF), a protein that is extracted from human blood. Thus, Gc protein binds chondroitin sulfate on the cell surface and such an interaction may occur also in blood, colostrum and milk. This interpretation would solve the inconsistencies encountered in explaining the effects of GcMAF in vitro and in vivo. According to our model, the Gc protein or the GcMAF bind to chondroitin sulfate both on the cell surface and in bodily fluids, and the resulting multimolecular complexes, under the form of oligomers trigger a transmembrane signal or, alternatively, are internalized and convey the signal directly to the nucleus thus eliciting the diverse biological effects observed for both GcMAF and chondroitin sulfate.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the lipid mediators involved and their cellular targets have not been identified. Mice lacking Pla2g5 showed markedly reduced lung ILC2 activation and eosinophilia following repetitive Alternaria Alternata inhalation. While Pla2g5-null mice had Wt levels of immediate IL-33 release after one Alternaria dose, they failed to upregulate IL-33 in macrophages following repeated Alternaria administration. Unexpectedly, while adoptive transfer of bone marrow-derived (BM)-macrophages restored ILC2 activation and eosinophilia in Alternaria-exposed Pla2g5-null mice, exogenous IL-33 did not. Conversely, transfers of Pla2g5-null BM-macrophages reduced inflammation in Alternaria-exposed Wt mice. Mass spectrometry analysis of free fatty acids (FFAs) demonstrated significantly reduced FFAs (including linoleic  (LA) and  (OA)) in lung and BM-macrophages lacking Pla2g5. Exogenous administration of LA or LA+OA to Wt mice sharply potentiated IL-33-induced lung eosinophilia and ILC2 expansion in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, OA potentiated IL-33-induced inflammation and ILC2 expansion in Pla2g5-null mice, but LA was inactive both in vivo and in vitro. Notably, Pla2g5-null ILC2s showed significantly reduced expression of the FFA-receptor-1 compared to Wt ILC2s. Thus, macrophage-associated Pla2g5 contributes significantly to type-2 immunity through regulation of IL-33 induction and FFA-driven ILC2 activation.</p></html>
