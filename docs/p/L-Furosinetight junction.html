On day 6, lenses from zebrafish larvae were isolated and treated with 3% trypsin, and changes in hyaloid-retinal vessels were analysed using fluorescent stereomicroscopy. In addition, expression of tight junction proteins (such as zonula occludens-1), effects of hyperosmolar solutions and of hypoxia, and Vegf expression were assessed by RT -PCR. NO production was assessed with a fluorescent substrate. Effects of inhibitors of the VEGF receptor, NO synthesis and a VEGF antibody (ranibizumab) were also measured.In this high-glucose model, dilation of hyaloid-retinal vessels, on day 6, was accompanied by morphological lesions with disruption of tight junction proteins, overproduction of Vegf mRNA and increased NO production. Treatment of this high-glucose model with an inhibitor of VEGF receptor  kinase or an inhibitor of NO synthase or ranibizumab decreased dilation of hyaloid-retinal vessels.These findings suggest that short-term exposure of zebrafish larvae to high-glucose conditions could be used for screening and drug discovery for diabetic retinopathy and particularly for disorders of retinal vessels related to disruption of tight junction proteins and excessive VEGF and NO production.© 2015 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26050620>Shp2 promotes metastasis of prostate cancer by attenuating the PAR3/PAR6/aPKC polarity protein complex and enhancing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.</a></h1><p>Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), marked by the dissolution of cell-cell , loss of cell polarity and increased cell motility, is one of the essential steps for prostate cancer metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism has not been fully explored. We report in this study that Shp2 is upregulated in prostate cancers and is associated with a poor disease outcome, namely tumor metastasis and shortened patient survival. Overexpression of wild-type Shp2 or an oncogenic Shp2 mutant leads to increased prostate cancer cell proliferation, colony and sphere formation, and in vivo tumor formation. Opposite effects are seen in Shp2-knockdown cells. Moreover, Shp2 promotes in vitro migration and in vivo metastasis of prostatic tumor cells. Mechanistically, Shp2 interacts with PAR3 (partitioning-defective 3) via its Src homology-2 domain. Ectopic expression of Shp2 attenuates the phosphorylation of PAR3 and the formation of the PAR3/PAR6/atypical protein kinase C polarity protein complex, resulting in disrupted cell polarity, dysregulated cell-cell  and increased EMT. These findings provide a novel mechanism by which oncogenic signal-transduction molecules regulate cell polarity and induction of EMT.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722904>Cyclic stretch disrupts apical junctional complexes in Caco-2 cell monolayers by a JNK-2-, c-Src-, and MLCK-dependent mechanism.</a></h1><p>The intestinal epithelium is subjected to various types of mechanical stress. In this study, we investigated the impact of cyclic stretch on  and adherens  integrity in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Stretch for 2 h resulted in a dramatic modulation of  protein distribution from a linear organization into wavy structure. Continuation of cyclic stretch for 6 h led to redistribution of  proteins from the intercellular  into the intracellular compartment. Disruption of  was associated with redistribution of adherens  proteins, E-cadherin and β-catenin, and dissociation of the actin cytoskeleton at the actomyosin belt. Stretch activates JNK2, c-Src, and myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK). Inhibition of JNK, Src kinase or MLCK activity and knockdown of JNK2 or c-Src attenuated stretch-induced disruption of , adherens , and actin cytoskeleton. Paracellular permeability measured by a novel method demonstrated that cyclic stretch increases paracellular permeability by a JNK, Src kinase, and MLCK-dependent mechanism. Stretch increased  phosphorylation of occludin, ZO-1, E-cadherin, and β-catenin. Inhibition of JNK or Src kinase attenuated stretch-induced occludin phosphorylation. Immunofluorescence localization indicated that phospho-MLC colocalizes with the vesicle-like actin structure at the actomyosin belt in stretched cells. On the other hand, phospho-c-Src colocalizes with the actin at the apical region of cells. This study demonstrates that cyclic stretch disrupts  and adherens  by a JNK2, c-Src, and MLCK-dependent mechanism.Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26906422>The Drosophila tricellular  protein Gliotactin regulates its own mRNA levels through BMP-mediated induction of miR-184.</a></h1><p>Epithelial bicellular and tricellular  are essential for establishing and maintaining permeability barriers. Tricellular  are formed by the convergence of three bicellular  at the corners of neighbouring epithelia. Gliotactin, a member of the Neuroligin family, is located at theDrosophilatricellular , and is crucial for the formation of tricellular and septate , as well as permeability barrier function. Gliotactin protein levels are tightly controlled by phosphorylation at  residues and endocytosis. Blocking endocytosis or overexpressing Gliotactin results in the spread of Gliotactin from the tricellular , resulting in apoptosis, delamination and migration of epithelial cells. We show that Gliotactin levels are also regulated at the mRNA level by micro (mi)RNA-mediated degradation and that miRNAs are targeted to a short region in the 3'UTR that includes a conserved miR-184 target site. miR-184 also targets a suite of septate  proteins, including NrxIV, coracle and Mcr. miR-184 expression is triggered when Gliotactin is overexpressed, leading to activation of the BMP signalling pathway. Gliotactin specifically interferes with Dad, an inhibitory SMAD, leading to activation of the Tkv type-I receptor and activation of Mad to elevate the biogenesis and expression of miR-184.© 2016.

The potential effect of curcumin against alterations in TJ structure and function has not been evaluated in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. The present study explored whether curcumin is able to prevent the cisplatin-induced fibrosis and decreased expression of the TJ and adherens  (AJ) proteins occludin, claudin-2 and E-cadherin in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Curcumin (200 mg kg(-1)) was administered in three doses, and rats were sacrificed 72 h after cisplatin administration. Curcumin was able to scavenge, in a concentration-dependent way, superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, peroxyl radical, singlet oxygen, peroxynitrite anion, hypochlorous acid and hydrogen peroxide. Cisplatin-induced renal damage was associated with alterations in plasma creatinine, expression of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and of kidney injury molecule-1, histological damage, increase in apoptosis, fibrosis (evaluated by transforming growth factor β1, collagen I and IV and α-smooth muscle actin expressions), increase in oxidative/nitrosative stress (evaluated by Hsp70/72 expression, protein  nitration, superoxide anion production in isolated glomeruli and proximal tubules, and protein levels of NADPH oxidase subunits p47(phox) and gp91(phox), protein kinase C β2, and Nrf2) as well as by decreased expression of occludin, claudin-2, β-catenin and E-cadherin. Curcumin treatment prevented all the above-described alterations. The protective effect of curcumin against cisplatin-induced fibrosis and decreased proteins of the TJ and AJ was associated with the prevention of glomerular and proximal tubular superoxide anion production induced by NADPH oxidase activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26023235>Structural Basis of a Key Factor Regulating the Affinity between the Zonula Occludens First PDZ Domain and Claudins.</a></h1><p>The molecular seal between epithelial cells, called the  (TJ), is built by several membrane proteins, with claudins playing the most prominent role. The scaffold proteins of the zonula occludens family are required for the correct localization of claudins and hence formation of the TJ. The intracellular C terminus of claudins binds to the N-terminal PDZ domain of zonula occludens proteins (PDZ1). Of the 23 identified human claudin proteins, nine possess a  at the -6 position. Here we show that the claudin affinity for PDZ1 is dependent on the presence or absence of this  and that the affinity is reduced if the  is modified by phosphorylation. The PDZ1 β2-β3 loop undergoes a significant conformational change to accommodate this . Cell culture experiments support a regulatory role for this . Plasticity has been recognized as a critical property of TJs that allow cell remodeling and migration. Our work provides a molecular framework for how TJ plasticity may be regulated.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25527093>Development of a living membrane comprising a functional human renal proximal tubule cell monolayer on polyethersulfone polymeric membrane.</a></h1><p>The need for improved renal replacement therapies has stimulated innovative research for the development of a cell-based renal assist device. A key requirement for such a device is the formation of a "living membrane", consisting of a  kidney cell monolayer with preserved functional organic ion transporters on a suitable artificial membrane surface. In this work, we applied a unique conditionally immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cell (ciPTEC) line with an optimized coating strategy on polyethersulfone (PES) membranes to develop a living membrane with a functional proximal tubule epithelial cell layer. PES membranes were coated with combinations of 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine and human collagen IV (Coll IV). The optimal coating time and concentrations were determined to achieve retention of vital blood components while preserving high water transport and optimal ciPTEC adhesion. The ciPTEC monolayers obtained were examined through immunocytochemistry to detect zona occludens 1  proteins. Reproducible monolayers were formed when using a combination of 2 mg ml(-1) 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (4 min coating, 1h dissolution) and 25 μg ml(-1) Coll IV (4 min coating). The successful transport of (14)C-creatinine through the developed living membrane system was used as an indication for organic cation transporter functionality. The addition of metformin or cimetidine significantly reduced the creatinine transepithelial flux, indicating active creatinine uptake in ciPTECs, most likely mediated by the organic cation transporter, OCT2 (SLC22A2). In conclusion, this study shows the successful development of a living membrane consisting of a reproducible ciPTEC monolayer on PES membranes, an important step towards the development of a bioartificial kidney.Copyright © 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

As predicted, CTS affect numerous cellular functions related to the maintenance of the transmembrane gradient of monovalent cations, such as electrical membrane potential, cell volume, transepithelial movement of salt and osmotically-obliged water, symport of Na⁺ with inorganic phosphate, glucose, amino acids, nucleotides, etc. During the last two decades, it was shown that side-by-side with these canonical Na⁺/K⁺-dependent cellular responses, long-term exposure to CTS affects transcription, translation, , cell adhesion and exhibits tissue-specific impact on cell survival and death. It was also shown that CTS trigger diverse signaling cascades via conformational transitions of the Na⁺,K⁺-ATPase α-subunit that, in turn, results in the activation of membrane-associated non-receptor  kinase Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor. These findings allowed researchers to propose that endogenous CTS might be considered as a novel class of steroid hormones. We focus our review on the analysis of the relative impact Na⁺,K⁺-mediated and -independent pathways in cellular responses evoked by CTS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23064762>Acetaldehyde disrupts  in Caco-2 cell monolayers by a protein phosphatase 2A-dependent mechanism.</a></h1><p>Acetaldehyde is accumulated at high concentrations in the colonic lumen following ethanol administration. Previous studies demonstrated that acetaldehyde disrupts intestinal epithelial  and increases paracellular permeability. In the present study, we investigated the role of PP2A in the acetaldehyde-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial . Caco-2 cell monolayers were exposed to 200-600 μM acetaldehyde for varying times, and the epithelial barrier function was evaluated by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance and inulin permeability. Acetaldehyde treatment resulted in a time-dependent increase in inulin permeability and redistribution of occludin and ZO-1 from the intercellular . Treatment of cells with fostriecin (a PP2A-selective inhibitor) or knockdown of PP2A by siRNA blocked acetaldehyde-induced increase in inulin permeability and redistribution of occludin and ZO-1. The effects of fostriecin and acetaldehyde were confirmed in mouse intestine ex vivo. Acetaldehyde-induced  disruption and barrier dysfunction were also attenuated by a PP2A-specific inhibitory peptide, TPDYFL. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that acetaldehyde increased the interaction of PP2A with occludin and induced dephosphorylation of occludin on threonine residues. Fostriecin and TPDYFL significantly reduced acetaldehyde-induced threonine dephosphorylation of occludin. Acetaldehyde failed to change the level of the methylated form of PP2A-C subunit. However, genistein (a  kinase inhibitor) blocked acetaldehyde-induced association of PP2A with occludin and threonine dephosphorylation of occludin. These results demonstrate that acetaldehyde-induced disruption of  is mediated by PP2A translocation to  and dephosphorylation of occludin on threonine residues.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28231640>Mind the gap: mechanisms regulating the endothelial barrier.</a></h1><p>The endothelial barrier consists of intercellular contacts localized in the cleft between endothelial cells, which is covered by the glycocalyx in a sievelike manner. Both types of barrier-forming , i.e. the adherens  (AJ) serving mechanical anchorage and mechanotransduction and the  (TJ) sealing the intercellular space to limit paracellular permeability, are tethered to the actin cytoskeleton. Under resting conditions, the endothelium thereby builds a selective layer controlling the exchange of fluid and solutes with the surrounding tissue. However, in the situation of an inflammatory response such as in anaphylaxis or sepsis intercellular contacts disintegrate in post-capillary venules leading to intercellular gap formation. The resulting oedema can cause shock and multi-organ failure. Therefore, maintenance as well as coordinated opening and closure of interendothelial  is tightly regulated. The two principle underlying mechanisms comprise spatiotemporal activity control of the small GTPases Rac1 and RhoA and the balance of the phosphorylation state of AJ proteins. In the resting state, junctional Rac1 and RhoA activity is enhanced by junctional components, actin-binding proteins, cAMP signalling and extracellular cues such as sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1). In addition, phosphorylation of AJ components is prevented by -associated phosphatases including vascular endothelial protein  phosphatase (VE-PTP). In contrast, inflammatory mediators inhibiting cAMP/Rac1 signalling cause strong activation of RhoA and induce AJ phosphorylation finally leading to endocytosis and cleavage of VE-cadherin. This results in dissolution of TJs the outcome of which is endothelial barrier breakdown.© 2017 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

However, little is understood regarding the underlying mechanism of resistance. The present study aimed to identify the underlying crucial genes and regulatory networks associated with docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer using bioinformatics analyses. For this purpose, one expression profile dataset (GSE33455), which included two docetaxel-sensitive and two docetaxel-resistant cell lines, was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and analyses of differential gene expression and function enrichment were performed. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, and the associated hub genes were investigated using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins and Cytoscape software. A total of 756 differentially expression genes (DEGs) were identified, including 509 downregulated and 247 upregulated genes. Enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs were associated with the interferon-γ-mediated signaling pathway, protein binding, bicellular  and cancer pathways. Two modules were screened from the PPI network, and the corresponding genes were identified to be largely enriched in the interferon-γ-mediated signaling pathway and the negative regulators of the DExD/H-Box helicase 58/interferon induced with helicase C domain 1 signaling pathway, and enriched in cell-cell adhesion and the Rap1 signaling pathway. Among the ten hub genes, epidermal growth factor receptor, spleen  kinase (SYK), intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), interleukin (IL)6, CXC motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8), cyclin dependent kinase 1 and CD44 molecule (CD44) were significantly differentially expressed in prostate cancer tissues compared with healthy tissues based on The Cancer Genome Atlas data. The Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database revealed that ICAM1 was positively associated with IL6 and CXCL8, and epidermal growth factor receptor was positively associated with CD44 and SYK. Additionally, ten hub genes, which were identified to be associated with the drug resistance of docetaxel in prostatic carcinoma in the present study, were predominantly associated with tumor progression and metastasis. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis performed on docetaxel-sensitive and docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell lines demonstrated that certain hub genes, including CDK1, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 3, CXCL8 and CDH1, were highly expressed in the docetaxel-resistant cell lines, which confirmed the bioinformatics results. In conclusion, the present study identified a number of important genes that are associated with the molecular mechanism of docetaxel resistance by integrated bioinformatical analysis, and these genes and regulatory networks may assist with identifying potential gene therapy targets for CRPC. Further functional analyses are required to validate the current findings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27885577>Distinct Expression of Various Angiogenesis Factors in Mice Brain After Whole-Brain Irradiation by X-ray.</a></h1><p>Radiation-induced brain injury (RBI) is the most serious complication after radiotherapy. However, the etiology of RBI remains elusive. In order to evaluate the effect of X-rays on normal brain tissue, adult male BALB/C mice were subjected to whole-brain exposure with a single dose of 10 Gy or sham radiation. The structure and number of mice brain vessels were investigated 1, 7, 30, 90 and 180 days after irradiation by H&E staining and immune-fluorescence staining. Compared with sham control mice, in addition to morphological changes, a significant reduction of microvascular density was detected in irradiated mice brains. Whole-brain irradiation also caused damage in tight junction (TJ). Increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was observed in irradiated mouse brains showed by Western Blot. Immune-fluorescence staining results also verified the co-labeling of GFAP and VEGF after whole-brain irradiation. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of other angiogenesis factors, angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), endothelial-specific receptor  kinase (Tie-2), and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) in brain were determined by Western Blot. Increased expression of Ang-2 was shown in irradiated mouse brains. In contrast, whole-brain irradiation significantly decreased Ang-1 and Tie-2 expression. Our data indicated that X-rays induced time-dependent microvascular injury and activation of astrocytes after whole-brain irradiation in mouse brain. Distinct regulation of VEGF/Ang2 and Ang-1/Tie-2 are closely associated with RBI, suggesting that angiogenesis interventions might be beneficial for patients with RBI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21170030>Collective cell migration requires suppression of actomyosin at cell-cell contacts mediated by DDR1 and the cell polarity regulators Par3 and Par6.</a></h1><p>Collective cell migration occurs in a range of contexts: cancer cells frequently invade in cohorts while retaining cell-cell . Here we show that collective invasion by cancer cells depends on decreasing actomyosin contractility at sites of cell-cell contact. When actomyosin is not downregulated at cell-cell contacts, migrating cells lose cohesion. We provide a molecular mechanism for this downregulation. Depletion of discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) blocks collective cancer-cell invasion in a range of two-dimensional, three-dimensional and 'organotypic' models. DDR1 coordinates the Par3/Par6 cell-polarity complex through its carboxy terminus, binding PDZ domains in Par3 and Par6. The DDR1-Par3/Par6 complex controls the localization of RhoE to cell-cell contacts, where it antagonizes ROCK-driven actomyosin contractility. Depletion of DDR1, Par3, Par6 or RhoE leads to increased actomyosin contactility at cell-cell contacts, a loss of cell-cell cohesion and defective collective cell invasion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22361748>Occludin is required for apoptosis when claudin-claudin interactions are disrupted.</a></h1><p>Disruption of  is often seen during pathogen infection, inflammation, and tumor progression. Mislocalization of the  proteins occludin and claudin in mammary epithelial monolayers leads to apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway. To further investigate the mechanism of this response, a normal mammary epithelial cell line (EpH4) as well as primary mammary epithelial cells were treated with a claudin-disrupting mimic peptide, DFYNP (aspartic acid-phenylalanine--asparagine-proline). Using fluorescent indicators, we found that caspase-3 activation, resulting from treatment with DFYNP, was restricted to EpH4 and primary mammary epithelial cells with mislocalized claudin-4. Mislocalized claudin-4 and occludin were colocalized in non-junctional puncta, and both molecules were found in the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) where they colocalized with Fas, fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), active caspase-8 and caspase-3 at distinct apical domains. Importantly, caspase-3 activation was totally repressed in primary mammary epithelial cells from occludin null mice. Thus, the apoptotic response appears to be initiated by the movement of occludin to the DISC suggesting that this molecule has signaling properties that initiate cell death when its  location is disrupted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22671587>A phosphorylation hotspot within the occludin C-terminal domain.</a></h1><p> (TJs) form paracellular barriers defining the permeability characteristics of epithelial and endothelial cell layers in our body. Tetraspanin integral membrane proteins, including occludin, tricellulin, MarvelD3, and a set of claudins, form a network of anastomosing strands bringing the membranes of neighboring cells into close contact. Occludin is assumed to play an important role in the regulation of TJ formation, structure, and function, and is tightly regulated by phosphorylation. We here summarize the role of occludin phosphorylation on assembly/disassembly and function of TJs and specifically focus on a cluster of 11 amino acids in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of occludin (Tyr398-Ser408), including highly conserved phosphorylation sites for c-Src, PKCs, and CK2. Phosphorylation by these kinases affects occludin localization, dynamics, and interaction with other TJ proteins. Interestingly, this phosphorylation hotspot is localized in an unstructured region close to the ZO-1 binding site, and a cysteine residue which is involved in intermolecular disulfide-bond formation thus contributing to occludin dimerization. We discuss potential consequences and open questions in respect to the functional role of this phosphorylation hotspot.© 2012 New York Academy of Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579831>KY-226 Protects Blood-brain  Function Through the Akt/FoxO1 Signaling Pathway in Brain Ischemia.</a></h1><p>KY-226 is a protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibitor that protects neurons from cerebral ischemic injury. KY-226 restores Akt (protein kinase B) phosphorylation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) reduction in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) damage. However, the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of KY-226 are unclear. To address this, the effects of KY-226 on blood-brain  (BBB) dysfunction were examined in tMCAO mice. KY-226 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to ICR mice 30 min after 2 h of tMCAO. To assess Akt or ERK involvement, wortmannin (i.c.v.) or U0126 (i.v.), selective inhibitors of PI3K and ERK, respectively, were administered to mice 30 min before ischemia. BBB  was assessed by Evans blue leakage 24 h post-reperfusion. The levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins, ZO-1 and occludin, were measured by western blotting; ZO-1 mRNA level was measured by RT-PCR. Compared to vehicle, KY-226 treatment prevented BBB breakdown and reduction in TJ protein levels. KY-226 treatment restored ZO-1 mRNA levels post-reperfusion. Pre-administration of wortmannin or U0126 blocked the protective effects of KY-226 on ZO-1 protein and mRNA reduction in tMCAO mice. In bEnd.3 cells, lipopolysaccharide treatment reduced mRNA and protein levels of ZO-1, an effect rescued by KY-226 treatment. Further, KY-226 treatment restored phosphorylation of pAkt (T308) and its downstream target forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) (S256) in bEnd.3 cells. Collectively, we demonstrate that KY-226 protects BBB  by restoration of TJ proteins, an effect partly mediated by Akt/FoxO1 pathway activation. Thus, protection of BBB  likely underlies KY-226-induced neuroprotection in tMCAO mice.Copyright © 2018 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here we investigated HRG activation of ErbB receptors, and the role of this activation in the development of the permeability barrier in airway epithelial cells (AECs).Two airway epithelial-like cell lines, Calu-3 and 16HBE were exposed to HRG or no stimulus and were evaluated with respect to their paracellular permeability as determined by transepithelial electric resistance (TER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran flux.  (TJs) were assessed by immunocytochemical localization of occludin and zonula occludens-1.HRG promoted the development of the permeability barrier and TJ formation by monolayers of Calu-3 and 16HBE cells. Calu-3 cells expressed ErbB1, ErbB2, and ErbB3, but not ErbB4, on their surface. ErbB3 knockdown by small interference RNA (siRNA) blunted the effects of HRG on the permeability barrier. ErbB3 is known as a kinase-dead receptor and relies on other members of the family for its phosphorylation. To identify its heterodimerization partner, we knocked down the expression of other ErbB family receptors. We found that HRG's effect on the permeability barrier could be significantly attenuated by transfecting cells with ErbB2 siRNA but not with EGFR siRNA.These results indicate that HRG activation of ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimers is essential for regulation of the permeability barrier in AECs.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Membranes with selective ion and water passage are important for the electrolyte and water homeostasis in the kidney. Due to their role in the urinary concentration process, renal medullary cells are exposed to hyperosmotic stress. Therefore, we were interested in the question of how mouse inner medullary collecting duct cells (mIMCD3) manage to maintain their cell-cell contacts, despite hypertonicity-induced cell shrinkage. Employing mRNA expression analysis, we found that the zonula occludens type 1 (Zo-1), multi-PDZ domain protein 1 (MUPP1) and cortactin mRNA levels were upregulated in a tonicity-dependent manner. Using Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence, we show that the Zo-1 protein is upregulated, phosphorylated and linked to the actin cytoskeleton in response to hypertonic stress. After cell exposure to hypertonicity, rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton resulted in a stronger colocalization of actin fibres with Zo-1. Urea, which generates hyperosmolality, but no transcellular gradient, did not induce changes in Zo-1 protein expression or actin rearrangement. This data indicates that Zo-1 is a response protein to inner medullary tonicity and that extracellular stressors can promote Zo-1 protein expression,  phosphorylation and cytoskeleton association.Copyright © 2011 S.

We have shown a role for IL-18 in impaired gut barrier function following acute alcohol (EtOH) intoxication combined with burn injury. To further delineate the mechanism, this study examined whether IL-18 alters intestine  proteins or induces mucosal apoptosis under these conditions. To accomplish this, rats were gavaged with EtOH (3.2g/kg) prior to ~12.5% total body surface area burn or sham injury. One day after injury, EtOH combined with burn injury resulted in a significant decrease in total occludin protein and its phosphorylation in small intestine compared to either EtOH or burn injury alone. There was no change in claudin-1 protein content but its phosphorylation on  was decreased following EtOH and burn injury. This was accompanied with an increase in mucosal apoptosis (p<0.05). The treatment of rats with anti-IL-18 antibody at the time of burn injury prevented intestine apoptosis and normalized  proteins following EtOH and burn injury. Altogether, these findings suggest that IL-18 modulates  proteins and cause apoptosis leading to impaired intestinal mucosal integrity following EtOH intoxication combined with burn injury.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, the dietary Phe (and Phe + Tyr) requirement of young grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) was also estimated.

Gene expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), target of rapamycin (TOR) and inhibitor of nuclear factor κBα (IκBα) in proximal intestine (PI), mid intestine (MI) and distal intestine (DI) increased as dietary Phe increased up to 6.1, 9.1, 11.5 and 14.0 g kg(-1), respectively (P < 0.05). However, interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and nuclear factor-κB p65 (NF-κB p65) mRNA levels showed opposite tendencies. In addition, the mRNA level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was significantly lower in the intestinal tissue of the group fed a diet with Phe levels of 16.8 g kg(-1) than in those of other groups (P < 0.05). The expression of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) gene was increased as dietary Phe increased up to 9.1 g kg(-1) (P < 0.05). In conclusion, Phe improved intestinal immune status, and regulated gene expression of cytokines,  proteins, antioxidant enzymes, NF-κB p65, IκBα, TOR, and Nrf2 in the fish intestine. Based on the quadratic regression analysis of lysozyme activity at a 95% maximum, the dietary Phe requirement of young grass carp (256-629 g) was estimated to be 8.31 g kg(-1), corresponding to 2.75 g 100 g(-1) protein.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Incidentally, these bacterial signals can also modulate mammalian cell behaviour. We demonstrate here that 3O-C(12)-HSL can induce changes in calcium signalling through influx and release of calcium from thapsigargin-sensitive stores and delocalization of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)R), but not of ryanodine receptors (RyR). In parallel, P. aeruginosa 3O-C(12)-HSL disrupts  in human Caco-2 cells as evidenced by a reduction of the expression and distribution of ZO-3 and JAM-A. Using co-immunoprecipitation we also found an alteration in the binding of ZO-3 to JAM-A in protein complexes. Moreover, 3O-C(12)-HSL-treatment resulted in  hyperphosphorylation of ZO-3 and JAM-A. On the contrary, serine and threonine residues of ZO-1 and JAM-A became less phosphorylated after exposition of 3O-C(12)-HSL. The 3O-C(12)-HSL-induced intracellular calcium signalling and alteration in the phosphorylation status of  proteins furthermore correlated with changes in the association between JAM-A-ZO-3. The calcium inhibitors thapsigargin, xestospongin C, and dantrolene partly prevented the 3O-C(12)-HSL-induced decreases in TER and increases in the paracellular flux of 10kDa dextran. These findings clearly suggest that P. aeruginosa 3O-C(12)-HSL can cause the loss of epithelial barrier function via calcium signalling and further alteration in the phosphorylation status of  proteins; and that bacterial quorum sensing signals represent inter-kingdom signalling.Copyright 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

Both junctional adhesion molecules and Eph/ephrin are involved in normal tissue development and cancer progression. However, the expression levels and clinical significances of junctional adhesion molecule-A, a member of junctional adhesion molecules, and EphB2, a member of Eph/ephrin family, in lung adenocarcinoma patients are unclear. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to identify the expression and prognostic values of junctional adhesion molecule-A and EphB2 in lung adenocarcinoma patients' cohort. In our study, 70 (55.6%) showed high expression of junctional adhesion molecule-A protein and 51 (40.5%) showed high expression of EphB2 protein in 126 lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Junctional adhesion molecule-A and EphB2 expressions were both significantly increased in tumor tissues compared with noncancerous lung tissues. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test indicated that low expression of junctional adhesion molecule-A and EphB2 proteins can predict better survival and low mortality rate of lung adenocarcinomas. In univariate analysis, high expression levels of junctional adhesion molecule-A and EphB2 were both found to be significantly correlated with poor overall survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients (hazard ratio = 1.791, 95% confidence interval = 1.041-3.084, p = 0.035; hazard ratio = 1.762, 95% confidence interval = 1.038-2.992, p = 0.036, respectively). The multivariate Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated that EphB2 expression is an independent prognosis parameter in lung adenocarcinoma patients (hazard ratio = 1.738, 95% confidence interval = 1.023-2.952, p = 0.016). Taken together, high expression of junctional adhesion molecule-A and EphB2 can predict poor overall survival and high mortality rate, and EphB2 is an independent prognostic biomarker in lung adenocarcinoma patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603700>Enteroendocrine cells are specifically marked by cell surface expression of claudin-4 in mouse small intestine.</a></h1><p>Enteroendocrine cells are solitary epithelial cells scattered throughout the gastrointestinal tract and produce various types of hormones, constituting one of the largest endocrine systems in the body. The study of these rare epithelial cells has been hampered by the difficulty in isolating them because of the lack of specific cell surface markers. Here, we report that enteroendocrine cells selectively express a  membrane protein, claudin-4 (Cld4), and are efficiently isolated with the use of an antibody specific for the Cld4 extracellular domain and flow cytometry. Sorted Cld4+ epithelial cells in the small intestine exclusively expressed a chromogranin A gene (Chga) and other enteroendocrine cell-related genes (Ffar1, Ffar4, Gpr119), and the population was divided into two subpopulations based on the activity of binding to Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 (UEA-1). A Cld4+UEA-1- cell population almost exclusively expressed glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide gene (Gip), thus representing K cells, whereas a Cld4+UEA-1+ cell population expressed other gut hormone genes, including glucagon-like peptide 1 (Gcg), pancreatic polypeptide-like peptide with N-terminal  amide (Pyy), cholecystokinin (Cck), secretin (Sct), and tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1). In addition, we found that orally administered luminal antigens were taken up by the solitary Cld4+ cells in the small intestinal villi, raising the possibility that enteroendocrine cells might also play a role in initiation of mucosal immunity. Our results provide a useful tool for the cellular and functional characterization of enteroendocrine cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23649490>Quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis reveals broad regulatory role of heparan sulfate on endothelial signaling.</a></h1><p>Heparan sulfate (HS) is a linear, abundant, highly sulfated polysaccharide that expresses in the vasculature. Recent genetic studies documented that HS critically modulates various endothelial cell functions. However, elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanism has been challenging because of the presence of a large number of HS-binding ligands found in the examined experimental conditions. In this report, we used quantitative phosphoproteomics to examine the global HS-dependent signaling by comparing wild type and HS-deficient endothelial cells that were cultured in a serum-containing medium. A total of 7222 phosphopeptides, corresponding to 1179 proteins, were identified. Functional correlation analysis identified 25 HS-dependent functional networks, and the top five are related to cell morphology, cellular assembly and organization, cellular function and maintenance, cell-to-cell communication, inflammatory response and disorder, cell growth and proliferation, cell movement, and cellular survival and death. This is consistent with cell function studies showing that HS deficiency altered endothelial cell growth and mobility. Mining for the underlying molecular mechanisms further revealed that HS modulates signaling pathways critically related to cell adhesion, migration, and coagulation, including ILK, integrin, actin cytoskeleton organization,  and thrombin signaling. Intriguingly, this analysis unexpectedly determined that the top HS-dependent signaling is the IGF-1 signaling pathway, which has not been known to be modulated by HS. In-depth analysis of growth factor signaling identified 22 HS-dependent growth factor/cytokine/growth hormone signaling pathways, including those both previously known, such as HGF and VEGF, and those unknown, such as IGF-1, erythropoietin, angiopoietin/Tie, IL-17A and growth hormones. Twelve of the identified 22 growth factor/cytokine/growth hormone signaling pathways, including IGF-1 and angiopoietin/Tie signaling, were alternatively confirmed in phospho-receptor  kinase array analysis. In summary, our SILAC-based quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis confirmed previous findings and also uncovered novel HS-dependent functional networks and signaling, revealing a much broader regulatory role of HS on endothelial signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27375482>Soft TCPTP Agonism-Novel Target to Rescue Airway Epithelial  by Exogenous Spermidine.</a></h1><p>A reparative approach of disrupted epithelium in obstructive airway diseases, namely asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), may afford protection and long-lasting results compared to conventional therapies, e.g., corticosteroids or immunosuppressant drugs. Here, we propose the polyamine spermidine as a novel therapeutic agent in airways diseases, based on a recently identified mode of action: T-cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP) agonism. It may include and surpass single-inhibitors of stress and secondary growth factor pathway signaling, i.e., the new medicinal chemistry in lung diseases. Enhanced polyamine biosynthesis has been charged with aggravating prognosis by competing for L-arginine at detriment of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis with bronchoconstrictive effects. Although excess spermine, a higher polyamine, is harmful to airways physiology, spermidine can pivot the cell homeostasis during stress conditions by the activation of TCPTP. In fact, the dephosphorylating activity of TCPTP inhibits the signaling cascade that leads to the expression of genes involved in detachment and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and increases the expression of adhesion and tight junction proteins, thereby enhancing the  functionality in inflammation-prone tissues. Moreover, a further beneficial effect of spermidine may derive from its ability to promote autophagy, possibly in a TCPTP-dependent way. Since doses of spermidine in the micromolar range are sufficient to activate TCPTP, low amounts of spermidine administered in sustained release modality may provide an optimal pharmacologic profile for the treatment of obstructive airway diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24169556>Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) perturbs male rat Sertoli cell blood-testis barrier function by affecting F-actin organization via p-FAK-Tyr(407): an in vitro study.</a></h1><p>Environmental toxicants such as perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) have been implicated in male reproductive dysfunction, including reduced sperm count and semen quality, in humans. However, the underlying mechanism(s) remains unknown. Herein PFOS at 10-20 μM (∼5-10 μg/mL) was found to be more potent than bisphenol A (100 μM) in perturbing the blood-testis barrier (BTB) function by disrupting the Sertoli cell -permeability barrier without detectable cytotoxicity. We also delineated the underlying molecular mechanism by which PFOS perturbed Sertoli cell BTB function using an in vitro model that mimics the BTB in vivo. First, PFOS perturbed F-actin organization in Sertoli cells, causing truncation of actin filaments at the BTB. Thus, the actin-based cytoskeleton was no longer capable of supporting the distribution and/or localization of actin-regulatory and adhesion proteins at the cell-cell interface necessary to maintain BTB integrity. Second, PFOS was found to perturb inter-Sertoli cell gap  (GJ) communication based on a dye-transfer assay by down-regulating the expression of connexin-43, a GJ integral membrane protein. Third, phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-Tyr(407) was found to protect the BTB from the destructive effects of PFOS as shown in a study via an overexpression of an FAK Y407E phosphomimetic mutant. Also, transfection of Sertoli cells with an FAK-specific microRNA, miR-135b, to knock down the expression of phosphorylated FAK-Tyr(407) was found to worsen PFOS-mediated Sertoli cell  disruption. In summary, PFOS-induced BTB disruption is mediated by down-regulating phosphorylated FAK-Tyr(407) and connexin-43, which in turn perturbed F-actin organization and GJ-based intercellular communication, leading to mislocalization of actin-regulatory and adhesion proteins at the BTB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28008255>Rescuing cholinergic neurons from apoptotic degeneration by targeting of serotonin modulator-and apolipoprotein E-conjugated liposomes to the hippocampus.</a></h1><p>β-Amyloid (Aβ)-targeting liposomes (LIP) with surface serotonin modulator (SM) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) were utilized to facilitate the delivery of nerve growth factor (NGF) across the blood-brain  (BBB) for neuroprotection in the hippocampus. The therapeutic efficacy of SM- and ApoE-grafted LIP carrying NGF (NGF-SM-ApoE-LIP) was assessed by an in vitro Alzheimer's disease (AD) model of degenerated SK-N-MC cells and an in vivo AD model of Aβ-insulted Wistar rats. The experimental evidences revealed that the modified SM and ApoE on the surface of LIP increased the permeation of NGF across the BBB without serious damage to structural  of tight junction. When compared with free NGF, NGF-SM-ApoE-LIP upregulated the expression of phosphorylated neurotrophic  kinase receptor type 1 on cholinergic neurons and significantly improved their survival. In addition, NGF-SM-ApoE-LIP could reduce the secretion of acetylcholinesterase and malondialdehyde and rescue hippocampal neurons from apoptosis in rat brains. The synergistic effect of SM and ApoE is promising in the induction of NGF to inhibit the neurotoxicity of Aβ and NGF-SM-ApoE-LIP can be a potent antiapoptotic pharmacotherapy for clinical care of patients with AD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24324834>Moderate hypoxia followed by reoxygenation results in blood-brain barrier breakdown via oxidative stress-dependent  protein disruption.</a></h1><p>Re-canalization of cerebral vessels in ischemic stroke is pivotal to rescue dysfunctional brain areas that are exposed to moderate hypoxia within the penumbra from irreversible cell death. Goal of the present study was to evaluate the effect of moderate hypoxia followed by reoxygenation (MHR) on the evolution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in brain endothelial cells (BEC). BBB integrity was assessed in BEC in vitro and in microvessels of the guinea pig whole brain in situ preparation. Probes were exposed to MHR (2 hours 67-70 mmHg O2, 3 hours reoxygenation, BEC) or towards occlusion of the arteria cerebri media (MCAO) with or without subsequent reperfusion in the whole brain preparation. In vitro BBB integrity was evaluated using trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and transwell permeability assays. ROS in BEC were evaluated using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF), MitoSox and immunostaining for nitrotyrosine.  protein (TJ) integrity in BEC, stainings for nitrotyrosine and FITC-albumin extravasation in the guinea pig brain preparation were assessed by confocal microscopy. Diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) was used to investigate NADPH oxidase dependent ROS evolution and its effect on BBB parameters in BEC. MHR impaired TJ proteins zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and claudin 5 (Cl5), decreased TEER, and significantly increased cytosolic ROS in BEC. These events were blocked by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI. MCAO with or without subsequent reoxygenation resulted in extravasation of FITC-albumin and ROS generation in the penumbra region of the guinea pig brain preparation and confirmed BBB damage. BEC integrity may be impaired through ROS in MHR on the level of TJ and the BBB is also functionally impaired in moderate hypoxic conditions followed by reperfusion in a complex guinea pig brain preparation. These findings suggest that the BBB is susceptible towards MHR and that ROS play a key role in this process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29920501>Distinct Gene Expression Patterns between Nasal Mucosal Cells and Blood Collected from Allergic Rhinitis Sufferers.</a></h1><p>Investigations of gene expression in allergic rhinitis (AR) typically rely on invasive nasal biopsies (site of inflammation) or blood samples (systemic immunity) to obtain sufficient genetic material for analysis. New methodologies to circumvent the need for invasive sample collection offer promise to further the understanding of local immune mechanisms relevant in AR.A within-subject design was employed to compare immune gene expression profiles obtained from nasal washing/brushing and whole blood samples collected during peak pollen season. Twelve adults (age: 46.3 ± 12.3 years) with more than a 2-year history of AR and a confirmed grass pollen allergy participated in the study. Gene expression analysis was performed using a panel of 760 immune genes with the NanoString nCounter platform on nasal lavage/brushing cell lysates and compared to RNA extracted from blood.A total of 355 genes were significantly differentially expressed between sample types (9.87 to -9.71 log2 fold change). The top 3 genes significantly upregulated in nasal lysate samples were Mucin 1 (MUC1), Tight Junction Protein 1 (TJP1), and Lipocalin-2 (LCN2). The top 3 genes significantly upregulated in blood samples were cluster of differentiation 3e (CD3E), FYN Proto-Oncogene Src Family  Kinase (FYN) and cluster of differentiation 3d (CD3D).Overall, the blood and nasal lavage samples showed vastly distinct gene expression profiles and functional gene pathways which reflect their anatomical and functional origins. Evaluating immune gene expression of the nasal mucosa in addition to blood samples may be beneficial in understanding AR pathophysiology and response to allergen challenge.© 2018 S.

Disruption of  appears to have a crucial role in the pathogenesis of various liver diseases. In this study, we investigated the disruptive effect of hydrogen peroxide and the protective effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the  and adherens  in the bile duct epithelium. Oxidative stress in NRC-1 and Mz-ChA-1 cell monolayers was induced by administration of hydrogen peroxide. Barrier function was evaluated by measuring electrical resistance and inulin permeability. Integrity of , adherens  and the actin cytoskeleton was determined by imunofluorescence microscopy. Role of signaling molecules was determined by evaluating the effect of specific inhibitors. Hydrogen peroxide caused a rapid disruption of  and adherens  leading to barrier dysfunction without altering the cell viability. Hydrogen peroxide rapidly increased the levels of p-MLC (myosin light chain) and c-Src(pY418). ML-7 and PP2 (MLCK and Src kinase inhibitors) attenuated hydrogen peroxide-induced barrier dysfunction,  disruption and reorganization of actin cytoskeleton. Pretreatment of cell monolayers with EGF ameliorated hydrogen peroxide-induced  disruption and barrier dysfunction. The protective effect of EGF was abrogated by ET-18-OCH(3) and the Ro-32-0432 (PLCγ and PKC inhibitors). Hydrogen peroxide increased  phosphorylation of ZO-1, claudin-3, E-cadherin and β-catenin, and pretreatment of cells with EGF attenuated  phosphorylation of these proteins. These results demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide disrupts , adherens  and the actin cytoskeleton by an MLCK and Src kinase-dependent mechanism in the bile duct epithelium. EGF prevents hydrogen peroxide-induced  disruption by a PLCγ and PKC-dependent mechanism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25863128>Protein trafficking in colorectal carcinogenesis-targeting and bypassing resistance to currently applied treatments.</a></h1><p>Membrane receptors constitute novel targets during current treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) due to the fact that their aberrant expression/activity favors cancer cell properties. Protein trafficking is responsible for the correct targeting of membrane receptors to the apical and basolateral surfaces, as well as to the adherent and  of the cell. Impaired availability or distribution of these receptors along the plasma membrane is not only associated with defective cellular homeostasis and tumor progression, but also to emerging mechanisms of resistance to CRC-targeted therapy. The present review describes how protein trafficking facilitates invasion and metastasis of CRC cells and focuses on receptor  kinases (RTKs) endocytic transport, providing thoughts for surpassing RTKs-centered mechanisms of resistance.© The Author 2015.

In this study, we aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the HGF-mediated reconstitution of gastric epithelial structures by analyzing the expression and subcellular dynamics of  proteins.We treated human gastric epithelial MKN74 cells with HGF, and examined the effects of HGF on cell migration and proliferation, and the expression and subcellular dynamics of  proteins; as well, we investigated the effect of HGF on paracellular permeability to macromolecules (using fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC]-dextran).HGF significantly stimulated the migration of MKN74 cells, but not their proliferation, in a dose-dependent manner. HGF did not affect the expression of  proteins, including claudin-1, -3, -4 and -7; occludin; and zonula occludens (ZO)-1. However, fluorescence immunostaining revealed that, in the cell membrane, the levels of ZO-1, but not those of occludin or claudin-4, were transiently decreased 1 h after HGF treatment. The results were further confirmed by western blotting: HGF reduced the amount of ZO-1 protein in the cell membrane fraction concomitantly with an increase in cytoplasmic ZO-1. Furthermore, HGF reduced the interaction between ZO-1 and occludin, and induced the  phosphorylation of occludin, whereas the phosphorylation status of ZO-1 was not affected by exposure to HGF. Despite a decrease in the ZO-1/occludin interaction, HGF did not affect paracellular permeability to macromolecules.HGF alters the subcellular localization of ZO-1, probably through the  phosphorylation of occludin, which may induce cell dispersion during epithelial restitution.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23771907>Targeting ROR1 inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis.</a></h1><p>Metastasis is responsible for 90% of cancer-related deaths. Strategies are needed that can inhibit the capacity of cancer cells to migrate across the anatomic barriers and colonize distant organs. Here, we show an association between metastasis and expression of a type I receptor  kinase-like orphan receptor, ROR1, which is expressed during embryogenesis and by various cancers, but not by normal postpartum tissues. We found that expression of ROR1 associates with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which occurs during embryogenesis and cancer metastasis. Breast adenocarcinomas expressing high levels of ROR1 were more likely to have gene expression signatures associated with EMT and had higher rates of relapse and metastasis than breast adenocarcinomas expressing low levels of ROR1. Suppressing expression of ROR1 in metastasis-prone breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231, HS-578T, or BT549, attenuated expression of proteins associated with EMT (e.g., vimentin, SNAIL-1/2, and ZEB1), enhanced expression of E-cadherin, epithelial cytokeratins (e.g., CK-19), and  proteins (e.g., ZO-1), and impaired their migration/invasion capacity in vitro and the metastatic potential of MDA-MB-231 cells in immunodeficient mice. Conversely, transfection of MCF-7 cells to express ROR1 reduced expression of E-cadherin and CK-19, but enhanced the expression of SNAIL-1/2 and vimentin. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 with a monoclonal antibody specific for ROR1 induced downmodulation of vimentin and inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and tumor metastasis in vivo. Collectively, this study indicates that ROR1 may regulate EMT and metastasis and that antibodies targeting ROR1 can inhibit cancer progression and metastasis.©2013 AACR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28431964>Microvillus-Specific Protein  Phosphatase SAP-1 Plays a Role in Regulating the Intestinal Paracellular Transport of Macromolecules.</a></h1><p>The stomach cancer-associated protein  phosphatase 1 (SAP-1) is a receptor-type protein  phosphatase that is specifically expressed on the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelium. SAP-1 is known to maintain the balance of phosphorylation of proteins together with protein kinases; however, its biological function and impact on pharmacokinetics in the intestine remain unclear. The present study, therefore, aimed at clarifying the relationship between SAP-1 and the intestinal absorption behaviors of typical transporter substrates and macromolecules. The endogenous levels of glucose and total cholesterol in the blood were similar between wild-type and SAP-1-deficient mice (Sap1), suggesting no contribution of SAP-1 to biogenic influx. Moreover, in vitro transport study with everted ileal sacs demonstrated that there was no difference in the absorption of breast cancer resistance protein, P-glycoprotein, and peptide transporter substrates between both mice. However, absorptive clearance of macromolecular model dextrans (FD-4 and FD-10) in Sap1 mice was significantly higher than that in wild-type mice, and this was confirmed by the trend of increased FD-4 absorption from colonic loops of Sap1 mice. Therefore, the results of this study suggest the partial contribution of SAP-1 to the regulated transport of hydrophilic macromolecules through paracellular .Copyright © 2017 American Pharmacists Association®.

Previous BioID proximity labeling of  and adherens  proteins suggested that SORBS2 is a component of the apical  complex of epithelial cells. We asked whether SORBS2 plays a previously unappreciated role in controlling perijunctional actin and  barrier function. Using super resolution imaging we confirmed that SORBS2 is localized at the apical  complex but farther from the membrane than ZO-1 and located partially overlapping both the - and adherens  with a periodic concentration that alternates with myosin IIB in polarized epithelial cells. Overexpression of GFP-SORBS2 recruited alpha-actinin, vinculin and N-WASP, and possibly CIP4 to cellular . However, CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out of SORBS2 did not alter the localization- or immunofluorescent staining intensity of these or several other junctional- and cytoskeletal proteins. SORBS2 knock-out also did not affect the barrier function as measured by TER and dextran flux; nor did it change actin-dependent  re-assembly as measured by Ca2+-switch and Latrunculin-B wash-out assays. The kinetics of HGF-induced cell scattering and wound healing, and dextran flux increase induced by PDGF also were unaffected by SORBS2 knock-out. SORBS2 concentrates with apical junctional actin that accumulates in response to knock-down of ZO-1 and ZO-2. In spite of our finding that SORBS2 is clearly a component of the apical  complex, it does not appear to be required for either normal - or adherens  assembly, structure or function or for growth factor-mediated changes in  dynamics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21071472>FTY720-induced human pulmonary endothelial barrier enhancement is mediated by c-Abl.</a></h1><p>Strategies to improve pulmonary endothelial barrier function are needed to reverse the devastating effects of vascular leak in acute respiratory distress syndrome. FTY720 is a pharmaceutical analogue of the potent barrier-enhancing phospholipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). FTY720 decreases vascular permeability by an incompletely characterised mechanism that differs from S1P. Here, we describe its barrier-promoting effects on intracellular signalling and junctional assembly formation in human pulmonary endothelium. Permeability of cultured human pulmonary endothelial cells was assessed using transendothelial electrical resistance and dextran transwell assays. Junctional complex formation was assessed using membrane fractionation and immunofluorescence. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering (si)RNA were utilised to determine the effects of individual components on permeability. Unlike S1P, FTY720 failed to induce membrane translocation of adherens  or  proteins. β-catenin, occludin, claudin-5 or zona occludens protein (ZO)-1/ZO-2 siRNAs did not alter FTY720-induced barrier enhancement. FTY720 induced focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation and focal adhesion formation, with FAK siRNA partially attenuating the prolonged phase of barrier enhancement. Inhibition of Src, protein kinase (PK)A, PKG, PKC or protein phosphatase 2A failed to alter FTY720-induced barrier enhancement. FTY720 increased c-Abl  kinase activity and c-Abl siRNA attenuated peak barrier enhancement after FTY720.

Gliotactin is a  TCJ protein, and loss of Gliotactin results in SJ and TCJ breakdown and permeability barrier loss. When overexpressed, Gliotactin spreads away from the TCJs, resulting in disrupted epithelial architecture, including overproliferation, cell delamination, and migration. Gliotactin levels are tightly controlled at the mRNA level and at the protein level through endocytosis and degradation triggered by  phosphorylation. We identified C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) as a  kinase responsible for regulating Gliotactin endocytosis. Increased Csk suppresses the Gliotactin overexpression phenotypes by increasing endocytosis. Loss of Csk causes Gliotactin to spread away from the TCJ. Although Csk is known as a negative regulator of Src kinases, the effects of Csk on Gliotactin are independent of Src and likely occur through an adherens  associated complex. Overall, we identified a new Src-independent role for Csk in the control of Gliotactin, a key tricellular  protein.© 2018 Samarasekera and Auld.

We investigated the mechanism of ALI/ARDS lung hyperpermeability triggered by pulmonary exposure of mice to the highly toxic plant-derived toxin ricin. One prominent hallmark of ricin-mediated pulmonary intoxication is the rapid and massive influx of neutrophils to the lungs, where they contribute to the developing inflammation yet may also cause tissue damage, thereby promoting ricin-mediated morbidity. Here we show that pulmonary exposure of mice to ricin results in the rapid diminution of the junction proteins VE-cadherin, claudin 5, and connexin 43, belonging, respectively, to the adherens, tight, and gap junction protein families. Depletion of neutrophils in ricin-intoxicated mice attenuated the damage caused to these junction proteins, alleviated pulmonary edema, and significantly postponed the time to death of the intoxicated mice. Inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity recapitulated the response to neutrophil depletion observed in ricin-intoxicated mice and was associated with decreased insult to the junction proteins and alveolar-capillary . However, neutrophil-mediated MMP activity was not the sole mechanism responsible for pulmonary hyperpermeability, as exemplified by the ricin-mediated disruption of claudin 18, via a neutrophil-independent mechanism involving  phosphorylation. This in-depth study of the early stage mechanisms governing pulmonary tissue  during ALI/ARDS is expected to facilitate the tailoring of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of these diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29700355>Claudin 11 regulates bone homeostasis via bidirectional EphB4-EphrinB2 signaling.</a></h1><p>Claudins (Cldns) are well-established components of  (TJs) that play a pivotal role in the modulation of paracellular permeability. Several studies have explored the physiologic aspects of Cldn family members in bone metabolism. However, the effect of Cldn11, a major component of central nervous system myelin, on bone homeostasis has not been reported. In this study, we demonstrate that Cldn11 is a potential target for bone disease therapeutics as a dual modulator of osteogenesis enhancement and osteoclastogenesis inhibition. We found that Cldn11 played a negative role in the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand-induced osteoclast (OC) differentiation and function by downregulating the phosphorylated form of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Bruton's  kinase, and phospholipase C gamma 2, in turn impeding c-Fos and nuclear factor in activated T cell c1 expression. The enhancement of osteoblast (OB) differentiation by positive feedback of Cldn11 was achieved through the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, ERK, and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase. Importantly, this Cldn11-dependent dual event in bone metabolism arose from targeting EphrinB2 ligand reverse signaling in OC and EphB4 receptor forward signaling in OB. In agreement with these in vitro effects, subcutaneous injection of Cldn11 recombinant protein exerted anti-resorbing effects in a lipopolysaccharide-induced calvarial bone loss mouse model and increased osteogenic activity in a calvarial bone formation model. These findings suggest that Cldn11 is a novel regulator in bone homeostasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29614254>Mechanistic studies of a cell-permeant peptide designed to enhance myosin light chain phosphorylation in polarized intestinal epithelia.</a></h1><p> (TJ) structures restrict the movement of solutes between adjacent epithelial cells to maintain homeostatic conditions. A peptide, termed PIP 640, with the capacity to regulate the transient opening of intestinal TJ structures through an endogenous mechanism involving the induction of myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation at serine 19 (MLC-pS) has provided a promising new method to enhance the in vivo oral bioavailability of peptide therapeutics. PIP 640 is a decapeptide composed of all D-amino acids (rrdykvevrr-NH) that contains a central sequence designed to emulates a specific domain of C-kinase potentiated protein phosphatase-1 inhibitor-17 kDa (CPI-17) surrounded by positively-charged amino acids that provide a cell penetrating peptide (CPP)-like character. Here, we examine compositional requirements of PIP 640 with regard to its actions on MLC phosphorylation, its intracellular localization to TJ structures, and its interactions with MLC phosphatase (MLCP) elements that correlate with enhanced solute uptake. These studies showed that a glutamic acid and  within this peptide are critical for PIP 640 to retain its ability to increase MLC-pS levels and enhance the permeability of macromolecular solutes of the size range of therapeutic peptides without detectable cytotoxicity. On the other hand, exchange of the aspartic acid for alanine and then arginine resulted in an increasingly greater bias toward protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) relative to MLCP inhibition, an outcome that resulted in increased paracellular permeability for solutes in the size range of therapeutic peptides, but with a significant increase in cytotoxicity. Together, these data further our understanding of the composition requirements of PIP 640 with respect to the desired goal of transiently altering the intestinal epithelial cell paracellular barrier properties through an endogenous mechanism, providing a novel approach to enhance the oral bioavailability of poorly absorbed therapeutic agents of < ~ 5 kDa.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

One CAM member, platelet-endothelial-cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), plays an important role in tight junction among endothelia cells, leukocyte trafficking, and immune response through its homophilic and heterophilic binding patterns. Both kinds of interactions, which lead to endogenous and exogenous signal transmission, are derived from extracellular immunoglobulin-like (IgL) domains and cytoplasmic immunoreceptor -based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) of PECAM-1. To date, the mechanism of trans-homophilic interaction of PECAM-1 remains unclear. Here, we present the crystal structure of PECAM-1 IgL1-2 trans-homo dimer. Both IgL 1 and 2 adopt the classical Ig domain conformation comprised of two layers of β-sheets possessing antiparallel β-strands with each being anchored by a pair of cysteines forming a disulfide bond. The dimer interface includes hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions. The Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) envelope of PECAM-1 IgL1-6 supported such a dimer formation in solution. Cell adhesion assays on wildtype and mutant PECAM-1 further characterized the structural determinants in cell junction and communication.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27606882>Ouabain Modulates the Distribution of Connexin 43 in Epithelial Cells.</a></h1><p>The fact that ouabain has been identified as an endogenous substance, led us to inquire its physiological role in epithelial cells. Based on previous observations, we hypothesized that it influences processes related to cell contacts. Previously we have shown that nanomolar concentrations of ouabain up-regulate , accelerate ciliogenesis, and increase gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). Given that silencing assays indicated that connexin 43 (Cnx43) is involved in the GJIC response, in the present work we study whether ouabain affects Cnx43 expression and distribution.We seeded confluent monolayers of epithelial renal MDCK cells and incubated them with 10 nM ouabain during 1 h. Then we measured, by densitometric analysis of Western blot assays, the amount of Cnx43 in cells and in fractions enriched of plasma membrane. We also studied its localization with immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy.Cnx43 is remarkably displayed, outlining the borders of cells gathered in clusters, randomly scattered throughout the monolayer. Ouabain increases the density of such clusters, as well as the average number of cells per cluster, without inducing the synthesis of new Cnx43. It also promotes relocation towards the membrane, of subunits already available. The fact that such changes are inhibited by PP2 and PD98059 indicates that a signaling pathway, that includes c-Src and ERK1/2, is involved in this response.Ouabain induces the translocation of Cnx43 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. These findings support our hypothesis that one of the physiological roles of ouabain is the modulation of physiological processes that depend on cell to cell contacts.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

Efforts to elucidate the mechanism of its toxicity have focused on protein  phosphatases (PTPs), which regulate the function of  (TJs) in colon epithelial cells. Patulin reacts with the conserved cysteine residues in the catalytic domains of PTP isoforms. Treatment of Caco-2 human colon cancer cells, used as a colon epithelial model, with 50 µM patulin decreased the level of density-enhanced phosphatase-1 (DEP-1) protein to 30% of the control level after 6 h. The level of DEP-1 mRNA was also decreased during 24 h after treatment with patulin. Moreover, knockdown of DEP-1 increased the level of phosphorylated claudin-4. Destruction of TJs by patulin treatment was observed by immunostaining with an antibody against zonula occludens (ZO)-1. To better understand the mechanistic basis of the decrease in DEP-1 mRNA levels, we searched for a cis-element upstream of the DEP-1 gene and found an element responsive to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) protein. Using a PPARγ-specific antibody, we showed a decrease in PPARγ abundance to 42% of the control level within 6 h after treatment with patulin. PPARγ has four cysteine residues that are involved in zinc finger formation. Our data suggest that DEP-1 affects TJ function and that PPARγ might control DEP-1 expression. Therefore, the toxicity of patulin to cellular functions might be attributable to its ability to down-regulate the expression of DEP-1 and PPARγ.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25430887>Microstructure Features of Proventriculus and Ultrastructure of the Gastric Gland Cells in Chinese Taihe Black-bone Silky Fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus Brisson).</a></h1><p>To investigate microstructure of proventriculus and ultrastructure of the gastric gland cells from Chinese Taihe black-bone silky fowl (BSF), the proventriculus of 4-week-old BSF was sampled. Conventional histological and transmission electron microscope (TEM) methods were used in this study. The wall of the Taihe BSF proventriculus was consisted of four layers, the mucous, submucosa, muscularis externa and the serosa as others birds. The muscularis externa of the birds' proventriculus contained three layers. Much of the melanin was present in loose connective tissue of lamina propria, submucosa, and muscularis externa unlike others. In addition, the ultrastructure of the gastric gland cells was observed by TEM. There was only one kind of gland cell, for example oxynticopeptic cell in proventriculus of Taihe BSF. The oxynticopeptic cells contained numerous mitochondria, cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum (CRER), intracellular canaliculi (IC) that secrete hydrochloric acid and small amounts of pepsinogen granules. The rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) was irregular cisternae with ribosomes and surrounded tightly the mitochondria along their configuration. The electron-dense pepsinogen granules were round with various sizes. The neighbouring oxynticopeptic cells were closed up with  and gap . The inter-space between the neighbouring oxynticopeptic cells was stenosis or was filled with electron-dense extracellular substance. In conclusion, the gastric gland cells of Chinese Taihe BSF proventriculus were only oxynticopeptic cells that secrete hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen, but no parietal cells and chief cells of mammal. The gastric gland cells of proventriculus were underdeveloped compared with those of mammals.© 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24375098>Hypoxia selectively disrupts brain microvascular endothelial  complexes through a hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) dependent mechanism.</a></h1><p>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) constitutes a critical barrier for the maintenance of central nervous system homeostasis. Brain microvascular endothelial cells line the vessel walls and express  (TJ) complexes that restrict paracellular passage across the BBB, thereby fulfilling a crucial role in ensuring brain function. Hypoxia, an impaired O(2) delivery, is known to cause BBB dysfunction but the mechanisms that drive this disruption remain unclear. This study discloses the relevance of the master regulator of the hypoxic response, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), in hypoxia-induced barrier disruption using the rat brain endothelial cell line RBE4. Hypoxic exposure rapidly induced stabilization of the HIF-1 oxygen-dependent alpha subunit (HIF-1α) concomitantly with BBB impairment and TJ disruption mainly through delocalization and increased  phosphorylation of TJ proteins. Similar observations were obtained by normoxic stabilization of HIF-1α using CoCl(2), deferoxamine, and dimethyloxalylglycine underlining the involvement of HIF-1 in barrier dysfunction particularly via TJ alterations. In agreement inhibition of HIF-1 stabilization by 2-methoxyestradiol and YC-1 improved barrier function in hypoxic cells. Overall our data suggests that activation of HIF-1-mediated signaling disrupts TJ resulting in increased BBB permeability.© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24386110>The expression of the Nectin complex in human breast cancer and the role of Nectin-3 in the control of  during metastasis.</a></h1><p>Nectins are a family of integral protein molecules involved in the formation of functioning Adherens and  (TJ). Aberrant expression is associated with cancer progression but little is known how this effects changes in cell behaviour. This study aimed to ascertain the distribution of Nectins-1 to -4 in human breast cancer and the effect on junctional integrity of Nectin-3 modulation in human endothelial and breast cancer cells.A human breast tissue cohort was processed for Q-PCR and immunohistochemistry for analysis of Nectin-1/-2/-3/-4. Nectin-3 over-expression was induced in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and the human endothelial cell line HECV. Functional testing was carried out to ascertain changes in cell behaviour.Q-PCR revealed a distinct reduction in node positive tumours and in patients with poor outcome. There was increased expression of Nectin-1/-2 in patients with metastatic disease, Nectin-3/-4 was reduced. IHC revealed that Nectin-3 expression showed clear changes in distribution between normal and cancerous cells. Nectin-3 over-expression in MDA-MB-231 cells showed reduced invasion and migration even when treated with HGF. Changes in barrier function resulted in MDAN3 cells showing less change in resistance after 2h treatment with HGF (p<0.001). Nectin-3 transformed endothelial cells were significantly more adhesive, irrespective of treatment with HGF (p<0.05) and had reduced growth. Barrier function revealed that transformed HECV cells had significantly tighter  that wildtype cells when treated with HGF (p<0.0001). HGF-induced changes in permeability were also reduced. Overexpression of Nectin-3 produced endothelial cells with significantly reduced ability to form tubules (p<0.0001). Immunoprecipitation studies discovered hitherto novel associations for Nectin-3. Moreover, HGF appeared to exert an effect on Nectin-3 via  and threonine phosphorylation.Nectin-3 may be a key component in the formation of cell  and be a putative suppressor molecule to the invasion of breast cancer cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427082>Angiopoietin 1 attenuates interleukin-6-induced endothelial cell permeability through SHP-1.</a></h1><p>The regulation of endothelial cell (EC) permeability is critical for the physiological homeostasis of blood vessels and tissues. The elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines is highly associated with lesions, such as the increased vascular permeability of diabetic retinas. We have previously reported that interleukin-6 (IL-6) increases EC permeability through the downregulation of  protein expression. Angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) has an anti-permeability function, but the effect of Ang1 on vascular permeability induced by inflammatory cytokines is unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Ang1 on IL-6-induced EC permeability and its underlying molecular mechanisms. We demonstrated that Ang1 inhibited the IL-6-induced increase in EC permeability by inhibiting the reductions in the levels of  protein ZO-1 and occludin, which was related to the decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion through the inhibition of STAT3 activation by Ang1. Mechanistically, Ang1 induced the dissociation of the  phosphatase SHP-1 from the Tie2 receptor and increased the binding of SHP-1 to JAK1, JAK2, and STAT3, which are IL-6 downstream signaling proteins. We conclude that SHP-1 plays an important role in the Ang1-induced inhibition of JAK/STAT3 signaling. These results provide evidence for a potential beneficial role of Ang1 in suppressing the vascular permeability induced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in diabetic retinopathy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In addition to its nervous system functions, TrkB is also expressed in the aortic endothelium. However, the effects of endothelial TrkB signaling on atherosclerosis remained unknown. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that TrkB expression is downregulated in the endothelium of atherosclerotic lesions from ApoE-/- mice compared with the atheroma-free aorta of WT mice. Endothelial TrkB knockdown led to increased lesion size, lipid deposition and inflammatory responses in the atherosclerotic lesions of the ApoE-/- mice compared with the control mice. Mechanistic studies showed that TrkB activation prevented VE-cadherin shedding by enhancing the interaction between vascular endothelial protein  phosphatase and VE-cadherin, maintaining VE-cadherin in a dephosphorylated state. Our data demonstrate that TrkB is an endothelial injury-response molecule in atherogenesis.

Moreover, β-catenin is also pivotal in adherens  (AJ). Here, we investigate hepatocyte-specific β-catenin conditional null mice (KO) for any alterations in AJ and related  (TJ).Using gene array, PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and co-immunoprecipitation, we compare and contrast the composition of AJ and TJ in KO and littermate wild-type (WT) control livers.We show association of E-cadherin with β-catenin in epithelial cells of WT livers, which is lost in the KOs. While total levels of α-catenin, E-cadherin, and F-actin were modestly decreased, KO livers show increased γ-catenin/plakoglobin. By co-immunoprecipitation, E-cadherin/β-catenin/F-actin association was observed in WT livers, while the association of E-cadherin/γ-catenin/F-actin was evident in KO livers. γ-Catenin was localized at the hepatocyte membrane at baseline in the KO liver. While γ-catenin gene expression remained unaltered, an increase in serine- and threonine-phosphorylated, but not -phosphorylated γ-catenin was observed in KO livers. A continued presence of γ-catenin at the hepatocyte membrane, without any nuclear localization, was observed in liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy at 40 and 72 h, in both KO and WT. Analysis of TJ revealed lack of claudin-2 and increased levels of JAM-A and claudin-1 in KO livers.β-Catenin adequately maintains AJ in the absence of β-catenin in hepatocytes; however, it lacks nuclear localization. Moreover, β-catenin/claudin-2 may be an important mechanism of crosstalk between the AJ and TJ.Copyright © 2011 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study used Bend.3 cells to examine the signaling networks involved in the hyperpermeability of the brain endothelial barrier caused by LPS. The LPS-induced alterations in the brain endothelial barrier were associated with PKC (a, β, ζ) and RhoA, but were independent of PI3K and the  kinase pathway. Inhibition of PKC (a, β, ζ) and RhoA activity using shRNA and dominant negative mutants diminished the effects of LPS on the brain's endothelial TJs. The interactions between the PKC and Rho pathways were therefore examined. PKC-a and PKC-ζ, but not PKC-β interacted with RhoA in Bend.3 cells stimulated by LPS. PKC-a acted as the upstream molecule for Rho and PKC-ζ acted as the downstream target for Rho. Comparing the effect of double inhibition of "Rho and PKC" and single inhibition of "Rho" or "PKC" confirmed that this interaction is critical for LPS-induced brain endothelial cell hyperpermeability. Collectively these data are the first to suggest that LPS affects the brain's endothelial TJ barrier via PKC (a, β, ζ)- and RhoA, independent of the PI3K and  kinase pathways. In addition, PKC-a and PKC-ζ, respectively, act as the upstream and downstream regulator for RhoA in the process.Crown Copyright © 2012. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Impairment of the intercellular  (TJ) shield, which is the major determinant of intestinal barrier function, is associated with various diseases. Dietary flavonoids demonstrate various beneficial effects on our health; however, the information regarding their effects on TJ function is quite limited. To date, four flavonoids - epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), genistein, myricetin and quercetin - have been reported to exhibit promotive and protective effects on intestinal TJ barrier functions. Genistein, a major soybean isoflavone, protects TJ barrier function against oxidative stress, acetaldehyde, enteric bacteria and inflammatory cytokines. Genistein blocks the  phosphorylation of the TJ proteins induced by oxidative stress and acetaldehyde, which results in the disassembly of the proteins from the junctional complex. Quercetin, a flavonol, enhances intestinal TJ barrier function through the assembly and expression of TJ proteins. The change in phosphorylation status is responsible for the quercetin-mediated assembly of TJ proteins. TJ protein induction has an additional role in this effect. This review presents the recent advances in our understanding of the flavonoid-mediated promotive and protective effects on intestinal TJ barrier function with a particular focus on intracellular molecular mechanisms.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Inhalation of acid ceramidase facilitated the elimination of P. aeruginosa in acutely- or chronically-infected mice with cystic fibrosis. Thus, inhalation of acid ceramidase might be a preventive and/or curative treatment for patients with cystic fibrosis suffering from pneumonia.We treated cultured epithelial cells or leukemic T-lymphocytes (Jurkat cells) with purified acid ceramidase and determined intracellular signalling events, proliferation and cell survival. Specifically, we measured the activity of AKT, p38-kinase and p70S6-kinase using activation-specific phospho-antibodies in western blot studies. Trypan Blue staining served to analyze proliferation and cell survival.Our studies indicate that treatment of Chang epithelial cells or Jurkat T lymphocytes with purified acid ceramidase results in a dose dependent activation of AKT, p38-kinase and p70S6-kinase, while  phosphorylation of intracellular proteins remains largely unchanged. Acid ceramidase treatment did not change expression of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, ZO-2 and occludin. Cellular viability and proliferation were not affected by acid ceramidase treatment.Our data suggest that treatment of epithelial cells and lymphocytes with acid ceramidase results in activation of distinct pathways, in particular AKT- and p38K-dependent pathways, while no global activation or cell death was observed.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Basal cells in pseudostratified epithelia display a single long cytoplasmic process that can cross the  barrier to reach the lumen. Using in vivo microscopy to visualize the epididymis, a model system for the study of pseudostratified epithelia, we report here the surprising discovery that these basal cell projections--which we call axiopodia--periodically extend and retract over time. We found that axiopodia extensions and retractions follow an oscillatory pattern. This movement, which we refer to as periodic axial motility (PAM), is controlled by c-Src and MEK1/2-ERK1/2. Therapeutic inhibition of  kinase activity induces a retraction of these projections.

Here we have carried out large-scale identification of phosphotyrosine sites in pervanadate-treated native inner medullary collecting ducts of rat, with a view towards identification of physiological processes in epithelial cells that are potentially regulated by  phosphorylation. The method combined antibody-based affinity purification of  phosphorylated peptides coupled with immobilized metal ion chromatography to enrich  phosphopeptides, which were identified by LC-MS/MS. A total of 418 unique  phosphorylation sites in 273 proteins were identified. A large fraction of these sites have not been previously reported on standard phosphoproteomic databases. All results are accessible via an online database: http://helixweb.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/iPY/. Analysis of surrounding sequences revealed four overrepresented motifs: [D/E]xxY*, Y*xxP, DY*, and Y*E, where the asterisk symbol indicates the site of phosphorylation. These motifs plus contextual information, integrated using the NetworKIN tool, suggest that the protein  kinases involved include members of the insulin- and ephrin-receptor kinase families. Analysis of the gene ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways whose protein elements are overrepresented in our data set point to structures involved in epithelial cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions ("adherens ," "," and "focal adhesion") and to components of the actin cytoskeleton as major sites of  phosphorylation in these cells.

The current study investigated the protective effect of hirsutenone against disruption of the intestinal barrier in vitro and in a mouse model of colitis. Caco-2 cells were stimulated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BH). Hirsutenone prevented the t-BH-induced increase in permeability by inhibiting the reduction in zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression, and rapidly stimulated  phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Hirsutenone-mediated protection against the loss of ZO-1 depends on the activation of both ERK1/2 and Akt signaling pathways. Interestingly, hirsutenone-mediated activation of Akt, but not ERK1/2, signaling was EGFR-dependent. Hirsutenone increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression through both EGFR/Akt- and ERK1/2-dependent pathways, contributing to the protective effects against TJ dysfunction. Colitis was induced in mice by intrarectal administration of 2,4,6,-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Hirsutenone administration improved the clinical parameters and tissue histological appearance, increased HO-1 expression, attenuated reduction of ZO-1 and occludin mRNA, and promoted BrdU incorporation in the colonic epithelium of TNBS-treated mice. Taken together, our results demonstrate that hirsutenone reverse disordered intestinal permeability by activating EGFR/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways, which are involved in the regulation of HO-1 expression. These findings highlight the potential of hirsutenone for clinical applications in the treatment of IBD.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

However, the current clinical therapies have proven to be inefficient in improving the prognosis for patients with sepsis. Catalpol, an iridoid glycoside extracted from the roots of Rehmannia, has been reported to protect against LPS-induced acute lung injury through a Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4)-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway. However, it is still unknown whether catalpol can be an effective treatment to ameliorate the LPS-induced microvascular disorder. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of catalpol on LPS-induced mesenteric microvascular disorder and its underlying mechanism. Male Wistar rats were challenged by infusion of LPS (10 mg·kg·h) through the left femoral vein for 120 min. Post-treatment with catalpol (10 mg/kg) alleviated the LPS-induced microvascular hyperpermeability and hemorrhage; reduced mortality; ameliorated the alteration in the distribution of claudin-5 and the junctional adhesion molecule-1, as well as the degradation of collagen IV and laminin; and attenuated the increase of TLR-4 level, phosphorylations of Src  kinase, phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase, focal adhesion kinase, and cathepsin B activation. In vitro study in human umbilical vein endothelial cells verified these results and further revealed that inhibition of TLR-4 and Src each simulated some, but not all, of the effects that catalpol exerted. Besides, surface plasmon resonance showed that catalpol could directly bind to TLR-4 and Src. These results demonstrated that catalpol was able to ameliorate the LPS-induced microvascular barrier damage and hemorrhage by targeting both TLR-4 and Src, thus attenuating the phosphorylation of Src kinase, phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase, and focal adhesion kinase, as well as cathepsin B activation.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23397631>C-Src and c-Yes are two unlikely partners of spermatogenesis and their roles in blood-testis barrier dynamics.</a></h1><p>Src family kinases (SFKs), in particular c-Src and c-Yes, are nonreceptor protein  kinases that mediate integrin signaling at focal adhesion complex at the cell-extracellular matrix interface to regulate cell adhesion, cell cycle progression, cell survival, proliferation and differentiation, most notably in cancer cells during tumorigenesis and metastasis. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that these two proto-oncogenes are integrated components of the stem cell niche and the cell-cell actin-based anchoring  known as ectoplasmic specialization (ES) at the: (1) Sertoli cell-spermatid interface known as apical ES and (2) Sertoli-Sertoli cell interface known as basal ES which together with  (TJ), gap  and desmosomes constitute the blood-testis barrier (BTB). At the stem cell niche, these SFKs regulate spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) renewal to maintain the proper population of SSC/spermatogonia for spermatogenesis. At the apical ES and the BTB, c-Src and c-Yes confer cell adhesion either by maintaining the proper phosphorylation status of integral membrane proteins at the site which in turn regulates protein-protein interactions between integral membrane proteins and their adaptors, or by facilitating androgen action on spermatogenesis via a nongenomic pathway which also modulates cell adhesion in the seminiferous epithelium.

The altered barrier function in these conditions is often linked to the release of soluble mediators from resident cells (e.g., mast cells, macrophages) and/or recruited blood cells. The interaction of the mediators with receptors expressed on the surface of endothelial cells diminishes barrier function either by altering the expression of adhesive proteins in the inter-endothelial , by altering the organization of the cytoskeleton, or both. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), proteolytic enzymes (e.g., matrix metalloproteinase, elastase), oncostatin M, and VEGF are part of a long list of mediators that have been implicated in endothelial barrier failure. In this review, we address the role of blood borne cells, including, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets, in the regulation of endothelial barrier function in health and disease. Attention is also devoted to new targets for therapeutic intervention in disease states with morbidity and mortality related to endothelial barrier dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25698679>All-trans retinoic acid prevents oxidative stress-induced loss of renal  proteins in type-1 diabetic model.</a></h1><p>We previously reported that diabetes decreased the expression of renal  (TJ) proteins claudin-5 in glomerulus, and claudin-2 and occludin in proximal tubule through an oxidative stress dependent way. Now we investigated whether all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), a compound that plays a relevant role in kidney maintenance and that possesses antioxidant properties, prevents loss of TJ proteins in streptozotocin (STZ)-treated rats. atRA was administered daily by gavage (1mg/kg) from Days 3-21 after STZ administration. atRA attenuated loss of body weight, proteinuria and natriuresis but it did not prevent hyperglucemia. Other metabolic alterations, such as: increased kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1, oxidative stress, protein kinase C (PKC) beta 2, NADPH oxidase subunits (p47(phox) and gp91(phox)) expressions and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling, and decreased nitric oxide synthesis, nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expressions were also attenuated by atRA. In vitro scavenging capacity assays showed that atRA scavenged peroxyl radicals (ROO•), singlet oxygen ((1)O2) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in a concentration-dependent manner. Decreased expressions of occludin, claudins-2 and -5 induced by diabetes were ameliorated by atRA. We also found that diabetes induced  nitration (3-NT), SUMOylation and phosphorylation in serine residues of claudin-2 and atRA prevented these changes. In conclusion, atRA exerted nephroprotective effects by attenuating oxidative stress and preventing loss of renal TJ proteins.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The present study aimed to explore the effect and underlying molecular mechanism of CLDN12 with regard to the malignant phenotype of SqCC. Firstly, the expression patterns of CLDN12 in SqCC tissues, lung adenocarcinoma tissues and histologically non-neoplastic lung epithelial tissues were investigated by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Additionally, associations between CLDN12 expression and clinicopathological indicators were examined in patients with SqCC. Furthermore, the impact of CLDN12 on the malignant phenotype of the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B  was assessed using the Cell Counting kit-8 assay, Transwell assay and a wound-healing experiment. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were also used to detect the impact of CLDN12 on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of BEAS-2B cells.  kinase 2 (Tyk2) RNA interference was further utilized to determine the impact of the Tyk2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1) signaling pathway on the EMT of BEAS-2B cells. To conclude, it was indicated that the expression of CLDN12 was upregulated in SqCC tissues and was associated with the extent of lymphatic metastasis in patients with SqCC. Furthermore, CLDN12 promoted the EMT of human bronchial epithelial cells . The findings indicated that the induction of Tyk2/Stat1 signaling appears to be an important mechanism by which CLDN12 promotes the EMT of SqCC cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23149730>A peptide derived from laminin-γ3 reversibly impairs spermatogenesis in rats.</a></h1><p>Cellular events that occur across the seminiferous epithelium in the mammalian testis during spermatogenesis are tightly coordinated by biologically active peptides released from laminin chains. Laminin-γ3 domain IV is released at the apical ectoplasmic specialization during spermiation and mediates restructuring of the blood-testis barrier, which facilitates the transit of preleptotene spermatocytes. Here we determine the biologically active domain in laminin-γ3 domain IV, which we designate F5 peptide, and show that the overexpression of this domain, or the use of a synthetic F5 peptide, in Sertoli cells with an established functional blood-testis barrier reversibly perturbs blood-testis barrier integrity in vitro and in the rat testis in vivo. This effect is mediated via changes in protein distribution at the Sertoli and Sertoli-germ-cell cell interface and by phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase at Tyr(407). The consequences are perturbed organization of actin filaments in Sertoli cells, disruption of the blood-testis barrier and spermatid loss. The impairment of spermatogenesis suggests that this laminin peptide fragment may serve as a contraceptive in male rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26090670>Angiopoietin-1 Regulates Brain Endothelial Permeability through PTPN-2 Mediated  Dephosphorylation of Occludin.</a></h1><p>Blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and increased endothelial permeability is a hallmark of neuro-vascular inflammation. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), a Tie-2 receptor agonist ligand, is known to modulate barrier function of endothelial cells; however the molecular mechanisms related to Ang-1 mediated repair of  (TJs) in brain endothelium still remain elusive. In this study, we investigated a novel role of non-receptor protein  phosphatase N-2 (PTPN-2) in Ang-1 mediated stabilization of  proteins.To study the barrier protective mechanism of Ang-1, we challenged human brain microvascular endothelial cells in-vitro, with a potent inflammatory mediator thrombin. By using confocal microscopy and transwell permeability assay, we show that pretreatment of brain endothelial cells with Ang-1 diminish thrombin mediated disruption of TJs and increase in endothelial permeability. We also found that Ang-1 inhibits thrombin induced  phosphorylation of Occludin and promote Occludin interaction with Zona Occludens-1 (ZO-1) to stabilize TJs. Interestingly, our study revealed that depletion of PTPN-2 by siRNAs abolishes Ang-1 ability to promote  dephosphorylation of Occludin, resulting Occludin disassociation from ZO-1 and endothelial hyperpermeability.Collectively, our findings suggest that in brain endothelial cells blocking PTPN-2 mediated  phosphorylation of Occludin is a novel mechanism to maintain BBB function, and may offer a key therapeutic strategy for neuro-inflammatory disorders associated with BBB disruption.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726862>Oxidative stress induces claudin-2 nitration in experimental type 1 diabetic nephropathy.</a></h1><p>Renal complications in diabetes are severe and may lead to renal insufficiency. Early alterations in  (TJ) proteins in diabetic nephropathy (DN) have not been explored and the role of oxidative stress in their disassembly has been poorly characterized. We investigated the expression and distribution of TJ proteins: claudin-5 in glomeruli (GL), occludin and claudin-2 in proximal tubules (PTs), and ZO-1 and claudin-1, -4, and -8 in distal tubules (DTs) of rats 21 days after streptozotocin injection. Redox status along the nephron segments was evaluated. Diabetes increased kidney injury molecule-1 expression. Expression of sodium glucose cotransporters (SGLT1 and SGLT2) and facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT2) was induced. Increased oxidative stress was present in GL and PTs and to a lesser extent in DTs (measured by superoxide production and PKCβ2 expression), owing to NADPH oxidase activation and uncoupling of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase-dependent pathway. Claudin-5, occludin, and claudin-2 expression was decreased, whereas claudin-4 and -8 expression increased. ZO-1 was redistributed from membrane to cytosol. Increased nitration of  residues in claudin-2 was found, which might contribute to decrement of this protein in proximal tubule. In contrast, occludin was not nitrated. We suggest that loss of claudin-2 is associated with increased natriuresis and that loss of glomerular claudin-5 might explain early presence of proteinuria. These findings suggest that oxidative stress is related to alterations in TJ proteins in the kidney that are relevant to the pathogenesis and progression of DN and for altered sodium regulation in diabetes.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The authors investigated the possible mechanisms and effect of vascular endothelial growth factor on alveolar epithelial barrier permeability in acute respiratory distress syndrome mice model.Eighty Male BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to four group: PBS group, LPS group, sFlt group, or LPS + sFlt group. The levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and total protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were compared, together with lung injury score and the histopathology of alveolar epithelial barrier. The expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor and  proteins mRNA in lung tissue were also studied.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhaling was accompanied with increasing lung vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. Anti-VEGF with soluble fms-like  kinase-1 (sFlt-1) attenuated the lung injury effectively.Our data indicate that anti-vascular endothelial growth factor with soluble fms-like  kinase-1 could maintain the normal structure and function of respiratory membrane in acute respiratory distress syndrome mice model and might be a suitable therapeutic tool for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Moreover, their roles in the stress response, DNA metabolism, cell division, and virulence have also been documented. The aim of this study was to investigate the pathogenicity and potential mechanisms of virulence dependent on the  kinase BceF and phosphotyrosine phosphatase BceD of the cystic fibrosis opportunistic pathogen Burkholderia contaminans IST408. The insertion mutants bceD::Tp and bceF::Tp showed similar attenuation of adhesion and invasion of the cystic fibrosis lung epithelial cell line CFBE41o- compared to the parental strain B. contaminans IST408. In the absence of bceD or bceF genes, B. contaminans also showed a reduction in the ability to translocate across polarized epithelial cell monolayers, demonstrated by a higher transepithelial electrical resistance, reduced flux of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled bovine serum albumin, and higher levels of  proteins ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1 present in monolayers exposed to these bacterial mutants. Furthermore, bceD::Tp and bceF::Tp mutants induced lower levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 release than the parental strain. In conclusion, although the mechanisms of pathogenicity dependent on BceD and BceF are not understood, these proteins contribute to the virulence of Burkholderia by enhancement of cell attachment and invasion, disruption of epithelial integrity, and modulation of the proinflammatory response.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Our previous findings indicated that alcohol-elicited blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage leads to neuroinflammation and neuronal loss. The dynamic function of the BBB requires a constant supply and utilization of glucose. Here we examined whether interference of glucose uptake and transport at the endothelium by alcohol leads to BBB dysfunction and neuronal degeneration.We tested the hypothesis in cell culture of human brain endothelial cells, neurons and alcohol intake in animal by immunofluorescence, Western blotting and glucose uptake assay methods.We found that decrease in glucose uptake correlates the reduction of glucose transporter protein 1 (GLUT1) in cell culture after 50 mM ethanol exposure. Decrease in GLUT1 protein levels was regulated at the translation process. In animal, chronic alcohol intake suppresses the transport of glucose into the frontal and occipital regions of the brain. This finding is validated by a marked decrease in GLUT1 protein expression in brain microvessel (the BBB). In parallel, alcohol intake impairs the BBB  proteins occludin, zonula occludens-1, and claudin-5 in the brain microvessel. Permeability of sodium fluorescein and Evans Blue confirms the leakiness of the BBB. Further, depletion of trans-endothelial electrical resistance of the cell monolayer supports the disruption of BBB integrity. Administration of acetyl-L: -carnitine (a neuroprotective agent) significantly prevents the adverse effects of alcohol on glucose uptake, BBB damage and neuronal degeneration.These findings suggest that alcohol-elicited inhibition of glucose transport at the blood-brain interface leads to BBB malfunction and neurological complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26403789>Factors controlling permeability of the blood-brain .</a></h1><p>As the primary protective  for neurons in the brain, the blood-brain  (BBB) exists between the blood microcirculation system and the brain parenchyma. The normal BBB  is essential in protecting the brain from systemic toxins and maintaining the necessary level of nutrients and ions for neuronal function. This  is mediated by structural BBB components, such as tight junction proteins, integrins, annexins, and agrin, of a multicellular system including endothelial cells, astrocytes, pericytes, etc. BBB dysfunction is a significant contributor to the pathogeneses of a variety of brain disorders. Many signaling factors have been identified to be able to control BBB permeability through regulating the structural components. Among those signaling factors are inflammatory mediators, free radicals, vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinases, microRNAs, etc. In this review, we provide a summary of recent progress regarding these structural components and signaling factors, relating to their roles in various brain disorders. Attention is also devoted to recent research regarding impact of pharmacological agents such as isoflurane on BBB permeability and how iron ion passes across BBB. Hopefully, a better understanding of the factors controlling BBB permeability helps develop novel pharmacological interventions of BBB hyperpermeability under pathological conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22201829>Functions of p120ctn isoforms in cell-cell adhesion and intracellular signaling.</a></h1><p>The functions of many organs depend on the generation of an epithelium. The transition from a set of loosely connected nonpolarized cells to organized sheets of closely associated polarized epithelial cells requires the assembly of specialized cell . In vertebrates, three major types of  are responsible for epithelial integrity: adherens , , and desmosomes. p120 catenin (p120ctn) is an Armadillo family member and a component of the cadherin-catenin complex in the adherens . It fulfils pleiotropic functions according to its subcellular localization: modulating the turnover rate of membrane-bound cadherins, regulating the activation of small RhoGTPases in the cytoplasm, and modulating nuclear transcription. Over the last two decades, knowledge of p120ctn obtained from in vitro experiments has been confirmed and extended by using different animal models. It has become clear that p120ctn is essential for normal development and homeostasis, at least in frog and mammals. p120ctn is a Src substrate that can be phosphorylated at different , serine and threonine residues and can dock various kinases and phosphatases. Thereby, p120ctn regulates the phosphorylation status and the junctional stability of the cadherin-catenin complex. Multiple p120ctn isoforms are generated by alternative splicing, which allows the translation to be initiated from four start codons and enables the inclusion of four alternatively used exons. We will discuss the effects of different p120ctn isoforms on cadherin turnover and intracellular signaling, in particular RhoGTPase activity and phosphorylation events.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28622455>Intestinal Metabolites Are Profoundly Altered in the Context of HLA-B27 Expression and Functionally Modulate Disease in a Rat Model of Spondyloarthritis.</a></h1><p>HLA-B27-associated spondyloarthritides are associated with an altered intestinal microbiota and bowel inflammation. We undertook this study to identify HLA-B27-dependent changes in both host and microbial metabolites in the HLA-B27/β -microglobulin (β m)-transgenic rat and to determine whether microbiota-derived metabolites could impact disease in this major model of spondyloarthritis.Cecal contents were collected from Fischer 344 33-3 HLA-B27/β m-transgenic rats and wild-type controls at 6 weeks (before disease) and 16 weeks (with active bowel inflammation). Metabolomic profiling was performed by high-throughput gas and liquid chromatography-based mass spectrometry. HLA-B27/β m-transgenic rats were treated with the microbial metabolites propionate or butyrate in drinking water for 10 weeks, and disease activity was subsequently assessed.Our screen identified 582 metabolites, of which more than half were significantly altered by HLA-B27 expression at 16 weeks. Both microbial and host metabolites were altered, with multiple pathways affected, including those for amino acid, carbohydrate, xenobiotic, and medium-chain fatty acid metabolism. Differences were even observed at 6 weeks, with up-regulation of histidine, , spermidine, N-acetylmuramate, and glycerate in HLA-B27/β m-transgenic rats. Administration of the short-chain fatty acid propionate significantly attenuated HLA-B27-associated inflammatory disease, although this was not associated with increased FoxP3+ T cell induction or with altered expression of the immunomodulatory cytokines interleukin-10 (IL-10) or IL-33 or of the tight junction protein zonula occludens 1. HLA-B27 expression was also associated with altered host expression of messenger RNA for the microbial metabolite receptors free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2), FFAR3, and niacin receptor 1.HLA-B27 expression profoundly impacts the intestinal metabolome, with changes evident in rats even at age 6 weeks. Critically, we demonstrate that a microbial metabolite, propionate, attenuates development of HLA-B27-associated inflammatory disease.

In this report, we assessed S-nitrosylation and nitration of Keap1 to identify downstream nitric oxide redox signaling targets into endothelial cells during ischemia. Here, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) exposure initiates the nuclear import of Keap1 in endothelial cells, which interacted with nuclear-localized Nrf2, as demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemical assay. Paralleling the ischemia-induced nuclear import of Keap1, increased nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity in endothelial cells was also observed. Consistently, the addition of peroxynitrite provoked nuclear import of Keap1 and a concomitant Nrf2 nuclear import in the endothelial cells. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of nitrosative stress by melatonin partially inhibited the OGD-induced constitutive nuclear import of Keap1 and subsequently disturbance of Nrf2/Keap1 signaling. Moreover, the effect of melatonin on nitration and S-nitrosylation of keap1 was examined in endothelial cells with 6 hr OGD exposure. Here, we demonstrated that OGD induced  nitration of Keap1, which was blocked by melatonin treatment, while there were no significant changes in S-nitrosylation of Keap1. The specific amino acid residues of Keap1 involved in  nitration were identified as Y473 by mass spectrometry. Moreover, the protective role of melatonin against damage to endothelial  integrity was addressed by ZO-1 expression, paralleled with the restored heme oxygenase-1 levels during OGD. Together, our results emphasize that upon nitrosative stress, the protective effect of melatonin on endothelial cells is likely mediated at least in part by inhibition of ischemia-evoked protein nitration of Keap1, hence contributing to relieve the disturbance of Nrf2/Keap1 antioxidative signaling.© 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27613541>Influence of blood-brain barrier permeability on O-(2-F-fluoroethyl)- uptake in rat gliomas.</a></h1><p>O-(2-F-fluoroethyl)- (F-FET) is an established tracer for the diagnosis of brain tumors with PET. This study investigates the influence of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability on F-FET uptake in two rat glioma models and one human xenograft model.F98 glioma, 9L gliosarcoma or human U87 glioblastoma cells were implanted into the striatum of 56 Fischer or RNU rats. Thereafter, animals were divided into a control group and a group receiving injections of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex). After 12-13 days of tumor growth animals received injection of Evans blue dye (EBD) to visualize BBB disturbance and underwent F-FET PET followed by autoradiography. Time activity curves, standardized uptake values (SUV) and Tumor-to-brain ratios (TBR) of F-FET uptake [18-61 min post injection (p.i.)] were evaluated using a volume-of-Interest (VOI) analysis. BBB disturbance was quantitatively evaluated by EBD fluorescence. The membrane gaps of blood vessel endothelial  were measured using electron microscopy to visualize ultrastructural BBB alterations in one untreated and one Dex treated F98 glioma. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVAs.In Dex treated animals EBD extravasation was significantly reduced in 9L (P < 0.001) and U87 (P = 0.008) models and showed a trend in F98 models (P = 0.053). In contrast, no significant differences of F-FET uptake were observed between Dex treated animals and control group except a decrease of the TBR in the 9L tumor model in PET (P < 0.01). Ultrastructural evaluation of tumor blood vessel endothelia revealed significant reduction of the cleft diameter between endothelial cells after Dex treatment in F98 model (P = 0.010).Despite a considerable reduction of BBB permeability in rat gliomas after Dex treatment, no relevant changes of F-FET uptake were noted in this experimental study. Thus, F-FET uptake in gliomas appears to be widely independent of the permeability of the BBB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30087588>ErbB4 Preserves Blood-Brain   via the YAP/PIK3CB Pathway After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Rats.</a></h1><p>Studies have suggested that blood-brain  (BBB) disruption contributes to the pathogenesis of early brain injury after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Activation of the receptor  kinase ErbB4 can cause intramembrane proteolysis and release a soluble intracellular domain (ICD) that modulates transcription in the nucleus. This study was carried out to investigate the potential roles of ErbB4 in preserving BBB  after experimental SAH, as well as the underlying mechanisms of its protective effects. Endovascular perforation was used to prepare a rat SAH model. The SAH grade, neurological score, brain edema and BBB permeability were evaluated after surgery. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the localization of ErbB4 and yes-associated protein (YAP). ErbB4 activator Nrg1 isoform β1 (Nrg1β1), Specific ErbB4 siRNA, YAP siRNA and PIK3CB specific inhibitor TGX 221 were used to manipulate the proposed pathway. The expression levels of ErbB4 ICD and YAP were markly increased after SAH. Double immunohistochemistry labeling showed that ErbB4 and YAP were expressed in endothelial cells and neurons. Activation of ErbB4 by Nrg1β1 (dosage 150 ng/kg) treatment promoted the neurobehavioral deficit, alleviated the brain water content and reduced albumin leakage 24 and 72 h after SAH. ErbB4 activation significantly promoted YAP and PIK3CB activity and increased the expression of tight junction proteins Occludin and Claudin-5. Depletion of ErbB4 aggravated neurological impairment and BBB disruption after SAH. The beneficial effects of ErbB4 activation were abolished by YAP small-interfering RNA and specific PIK3CB inhibitor. Activation of ErbB4 improved neurological performance after SAH through the YAP/PIK3CB signaling pathway, this neuroprotective effects may associated with BBB maintenance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22493269>H2O2 activates G protein, α 12 to disrupt the junctional complex and enhance ischemia reperfusion injury.</a></h1><p>The epithelial cell  separates apical and basolateral domains and is essential for barrier function. Disruption of the  is a hallmark of epithelial cell damage and can lead to end organ damage including renal failure. Herein, we identify Gα12 activation by H(2)O(2) leading to  disruption and demonstrate a critical role for Gα12 activation during bilateral renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells with inducible Gα12 (Gα12-MDCK) and silenced Gα12 (shGα12-MDCK) were subjected to ATP depletion/repletion and H(2)O(2)/catalase as models of  disruption and recovery by monitoring transepithelial resistance. In ATP depleted cells, barrier disruption and recovery was not affected by Gα12, but reassembly was accelerated by Gα12 depletion. In contrast, silencing of Gα12 completely protected cells from H(2)O(2)-stimulated barrier disruption, a response that rapidly occurred in control cells. H(2)O(2) activated Src and Rho, and Src inhibition (by PP2), but not Rho (by Y27632), protected cells from H(2)O(2)-mediated barrier disruption. Immunofluorescent and biochemical analysis showed that H(2)O(2) led to increased  phosphorylation of numerous proteins and altered membrane localization of  proteins through Gα12/Src signaling pathway. Gα12 and Src were activated in vivo during ischemia/reperfusion injury, and transgenic mice with renal tubular QLα12 (activated mutant) expression were delayed in recovery and showed more extensive injury. Conversely, Gα12 knockout mice were nearly completely protected from ischemia/reperfusion injury. Taken together, these studies reveal that ROS stimulates Gα12 to activate injury pathways and identifies a therapeutic target for ameliorating ROS mediated injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20378826>Hydrogen peroxide activates focal adhesion kinase and c-Src by a phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-dependent mechanism and promotes cell migration in Caco-2 cell monolayers.</a></h1><p>Recent studies showed that c-Src and phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3) kinase mediate the oxidative stress-induced disruption of  in Caco-2 cell monolayers. The present study evaluated the roles of PI3 kinase and Src kinase in the oxidative stress-induced activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and acceleration of cell migration. Oxidative stress, induced by xanthine and xanthine oxidase system, rapidly increased phosphorylation of FAK on Y397, Y925, and Y577 in the detergent-insoluble and soluble fractions and increased its  kinase activity. The PI3 kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, and the Src kinase inhibitor, 4-amino-5[chlorophyll]-7-[t-butyl]pyrazolo[3-4-d]pyrimidine, attenuated  phosphorylation of FAK. Oxidative stress induced phosphorylation of c-Src on Y418 by a PI3 kinase-dependent mechanism, whereas oxidative stress-induced activation of PI3 kinase was independent of Src kinase activity. Hydrogen peroxide accelerated Caco-2 cell migration in a concentration-dependent manner. Promotion of cell migration by hydrogen peroxide was attenuated by LY294002 and PP2. Reduced expression of FAK by siRNA attenuated hydrogen peroxide-induced acceleration of cell migration. The expression of constitutively active c-Src(Y527F) enhanced cell migration, whereas the expression of dominant negative c-Src(K296R/Y528F) attenuated hydrogen peroxide-induced stimulation of cell migration. Oxidative stress-induced activation of c-Src and FAK was associated with a rapid increase in the  phosphorylation and the levels of paxillin and p130(CAS) in actin-rich, detergent-insoluble fractions. This study shows that oxidative stress activates FAK and accelerates cell migration in an intestinal epithelium by a PI3 kinase- and Src kinase-dependent mechanism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22327568>Body-barrier surveillance by epidermal γδ TCRs.</a></h1><p>The surveillance of body barriers relies on resident T cells whose repertoires are biased toward particular γδ T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) according to location. These γδ TCRs can recognize ligands that emerge after stress. Through the use of intravital dynamics-immunosignal correlative microscopy, we found that γ-chain variable region 5 (V(γ)5) TCRs expressed by epidermal T cells were constitutively clustered and functionally activated in vivo at steady state, forming true immunological synapses that polarized and anchored T cell projections at squamous keratinocyte . This synaptogenesis depended on TCR variable domains, the kinase Lck and the integrin α(E)β(7) but not the γδ lineage or the receptor NKG2D. In response to tissue stress, TCR-proximal signals did not increase substantially but underwent stress mode-dependent relocalization toward the basal epidermis and Langerhans cells. Thus, the γδ TCR orchestrates barrier surveillance proactively, presumably by recognizing tissue ligands expressed in the steady state.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726726>Molecular insights into NF2/Merlin tumor suppressor function.</a></h1><p>The FERM domain protein Merlin, encoded by the NF2 tumor suppressor gene, regulates cell proliferation in response to adhesive signaling. The growth inhibitory function of Merlin is induced by intercellular adhesion and inactivated by joint integrin/receptor  kinase signaling. Merlin contributes to the formation of cell  in polarized tissues, activates anti-mitogenic signaling at , and inhibits oncogenic gene expression. Thus, inactivation of Merlin causes uncontrolled mitogenic signaling and tumorigenesis. Merlin's predominant tumor suppressive functions are attributable to its control of oncogenic gene expression through regulation of Hippo signaling. Notably, Merlin translocates to the nucleus where it directly inhibits the CRL4(DCAF1) E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby suppressing inhibition of the Lats kinases. A dichotomy in NF2 function has emerged whereby Merlin acts at the cell cortex to organize cell  and propagate anti-mitogenic signaling, whereas it inhibits oncogenic gene expression through the inhibition of CRL4(DCAF1) and activation of Hippo signaling. The biochemical events underlying Merlin's normal function and tumor suppressive activity will be discussed in this Review, with emphasis on recent discoveries that have greatly influenced our understanding of Merlin biology.Copyright © 2014 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

We previously demonstrated that FTY720 S-phosphonate (Tys), an analog of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and FTY720, has more potent pulmonary barrier protective effects than these agents in vitro and in mouse models of ALI. Tys preserves expression of the barrier-promoting S1P1 receptor (S1PR1), whereas S1P and FTY720 induce its ubiquitination and degradation. Here we further characterize the novel barrier promoting effects of Tys in cultured human pulmonary endothelial cells (EC).In human lung EC, Tys significantly increased peripheral redistribution of adherens  proteins VE-cadherin and β-catenin and  protein ZO-1. Inhibition of VE-cadherin with blocking antibody significantly attenuated Tys-induced transendothelial resistance (TER) elevation, while ZO-1 siRNA partially inhibited this elevation. Tys significantly increased focal adhesion formation and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Pharmacologic inhibition of FAK significantly attenuated Tys-induced TER elevation. Tys significantly increased phosphorylation and peripheral redistribution of the actin-binding protein, cortactin, while cortactin siRNA partially attenuated Tys-induced TER elevation. Although Tys significantly increased phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β, neither PI3 kinase nor GSK3β inhibition altered Tys-induced TER elevation. Tys significantly increased Rac1 activity, while inhibition of Rac1 activity significantly attenuated Tys-induced VE-cadherin redistribution and TER elevation.Junctional complex, focal adhesion rearrangement and Rac1 activation play critical roles in Tys-mediated barrier protection in pulmonary EC. These results provide mechanistic insights into the effects of this potential ALI therapy.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The receptor  kinase EGFR acts as a cofactor for HCV entry by promoting CD81-CLDN1 complex formation via unknown mechanisms. We identify the GTPase HRas, activated downstream of EGFR signaling, as a key host signal transducer for EGFR-mediated HCV entry. Proteomic analysis revealed that HRas associates with tetraspanin CD81, CLDN1, and the previously unrecognized HCV entry cofactors integrin β1 and Ras-related protein Rap2B in hepatocyte membranes. HRas signaling is required for lateral membrane diffusion of CD81, which enables tetraspanin receptor complex assembly. HRas was also found to be relevant for entry of other viruses, including influenza. Our data demonstrate that viruses exploit HRas signaling for cellular entry by compartmentalization of entry factors and receptor trafficking.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, the role of Src in acute kidney injury (AKI) remains unestablished. To address this, we evaluated the effects of Src inhibition on renal dysfunction and pathological changes in a murine model of AKI induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). I/R injury to the kidney resulted in increased Src phosphorylation at  416 (activation). Administration of PP1, a highly selective Src inhibitor, blocked Src phosphorylation, improved renal function and ameliorated renal pathological damage. PP1 treatment also suppressed renal expression of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and reduced apoptosis in the injured kidney. Moreover, Src inhibition prevented downregulation of several adherens and  proteins, including E-cadherin, ZO-1, and claudins-1/-4 in the kidney after I/R injury as well as in cultured renal proximal tubular cells following oxidative stress. Finally, PP1 inhibited I/R-induced renal expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases1/2, signal transducer and activator of transcription-3, and nuclear factor-κB, and the infiltration of macrophages into the kidney. These data indicate that Src is a pivotal mediator of renal epithelial injury and that its inhibition may have a therapeutic potential to treat AKI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26455323>SPROUTY-2 represses the epithelial phenotype of colon carcinoma cells via upregulation of ZEB1 mediated by ETS1 and miR-200/miR-150.</a></h1><p>SPROUTY-2 (SPRY2) is a modulator of  kinase receptor signaling with receptor- and cell type-dependent inhibitory or enhancing effects. Studies on the action of SPRY2 in major cancers are conflicting and its role remains unclear. Here we have dissected SPRY2 action in human colon cancer. Global transcriptomic analyses show that SPRY2 downregulates genes encoding  proteins such as claudin-7 and occludin and other cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion molecules in human SW480-ADH colon carcinoma cells. Moreover, SPRY2 represses LLGL2/HUGL2, PATJ1/INADL and ST14, main regulators of the polarized epithelial phenotype, and ESRP1, an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inhibitor. A key action of SPRY2 is the upregulation of the major EMT inducer ZEB1, as these effects are reversed by ZEB1 knock-down by means of RNA interference. Consistently, we found an inverse correlation between the expression level of claudin-7 and those of SPRY2 and ZEB1 in human colon tumors. Mechanistically, ZEB1 upregulation by SPRY2 results from the combined induction of ETS1 transcription factor and the repression of microRNAs (miR-200 family, miR-150) that target ZEB1 RNA. Moreover, SPRY2 increased AKT activation by epidermal growth factor, whereas AKT and also Src inhibition reduced the induction of ZEB1. Altogether, these data suggest that AKT and Src are implicated in SPRY2 action. Collectively, these results show a tumorigenic role of SPRY2 in colon cancer that is based on the dysregulation of  and epithelial polarity master genes via upregulation of ZEB1. The dissection of the mechanism of action of SPRY2 in colon cancer cells is important to understand the upregulation of this gene in a subset of patients with this neoplasia that have poor prognosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26005708>Immune consequences of  kinase inhibitors that synergize with cancer immunotherapy.</a></h1><p>Combination therapy for the treatment of cancer is becoming increasingly essential as we gain improved understanding of the complexity of cancer progression and the mechanisms by which cancer cells become resistant to single-agent therapy. Recent studies, both clinical and preclinical, have suggested that immunotherapy is a promising approach to the treatment of cancer; however, strategies to improve its clinical efficacy are still needed. A number of recent studies have indicated that antiangiogenic  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) target multiple components of the tumor microenvironment and are an ideal class of agents for synergizing with cancer immunotherapy. TKIs are well known to modulate tumor endothelial cells, leading to vascular normalization; however, these agents have also been recently shown to decrease tumor compactness and , thereby reducing solid tumor pressure and allowing for improved perfusion of collapsed vessels and increased tumor oxygenation. In addition, some TKIs are capable of inducing immunogenic modulation, whereby tumor cells are sensitized to killing by T lymphocytes. Moreover, a number of TKIs have been shown to be involved in immune subset conditioning, increasing the frequency and function of effector immune elements, while decreasing the number and function of immune suppressor cells. The alteration of the immune landscape, direct modification of tumor cells, and improved vascular perfusion leads to improved antitumor efficacy when antiangiogenic TKIs are combined with immunotherapy. Collectively, the data presented in this review support the clinical combination of multi-targeted antiangiogenic TKIs, including but not limited to cabozantinib, sunitinib, and sorafenib, as well as to other antiangiogenic therapies, such as the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab, with cancer vaccines for improved treatment of solid tumors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22081706>Tempol modulates changes in xenobiotic permeability and occludin oligomeric assemblies at the blood-brain barrier during inflammatory pain.</a></h1><p>Our laboratory has shown that λ-carrageenan-induced peripheral inflammatory pain (CIP) can alter  (TJ) protein expression and/or assembly leading to changes in blood-brain barrier xenobiotic permeability. However, the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent oxidative stress during CIP is unknown. ROS (i.e., superoxide) are known to cause cellular damage in response to pain/inflammation. Therefore, we examined oxidative stress-associated effects at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in CIP rats. During CIP, increased staining of nitrosylated proteins was detected in hind paw tissue and enhanced presence of protein adducts containing 3-nitrotyrosine occurred at two molecular weights (i.e., 85 and 44 kDa) in brain microvessels. Tempol, a pharmacological ROS scavenger, attenuated formation of 3-nitrotyrosine-containing proteins in both the hind paw and in brain microvessels when administered 10 min before footpad injection of λ-carrageenan. Similarly, CIP increased 4-hydroxynoneal staining in brain microvessels and this effect was reduced by tempol. Brain permeability to [(14)C]sucrose and [(3)H]codeine was increased, and oligomeric assemblies of occludin, a critical TJ protein, were altered after 3 h CIP. Tempol attenuated both [(14)C]sucrose and [(3)H]codeine brain uptake as well as protected occludin oligomers from disruption in CIP animals, suggesting that ROS production/oxidative stress is involved in modulating BBB functional integrity during pain/inflammation. Interestingly, tempol administration reduced codeine analgesia in CIP animals, indicating that oxidative stress during pain/inflammation may affect opioid delivery to the brain and subsequent efficacy. Taken together, our data show for the first time that ROS pharmacological scavenging is a viable approach for maintaining BBB integrity and controlling central nervous system drug delivery during acute inflammatory pain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21062898>TNFalpha-induced and berberine-antagonized  barrier impairment via  kinase, Akt and NFkappaB signaling.</a></h1><p>TNFα-mediated  defects contribute to diarrhea in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). In our study, the signaling pathways of the TNFα effect on barrier- or pore-forming claudins were analyzed in HT-29/B6 human colon monolayers. Berberine, a herbal therapeutic agent that has been recently established as a therapy for diabetes and hypercholesterinemia, was able to completely antagonize the TNFα-mediated barrier defects in the cell model and in rat colon. Ussing chamber experiments and two-path impedance spectroscopy revealed a decrease of paracellular resistance after TNFα to 11±4%, whereas transcellular resistance was unchanged. The permeability of the paracellular marker fluorescein was increased fourfold. Berberine alone had no effect while it fully prevented the TNFα-induced barrier defects. This effect on resistance was confirmed in rat colon. TNFα removed claudin-1 from the  and increased claudin-2 expression. Berberine prevented TNFα-induced claudin-1 disassembly and upregulation of claudin-2. The effects of berberine were mimicked by genistein plus BAY11-7082, indicating that they are mediated via  kinase, pAkt and NFκB pathways. In conclusion, the anti-diarrheal effect of berberine is explained by a novel mechanism, suggesting a therapeutic approach against barrier breakdown in intestinal inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022492>Spermidine stimulates T cell protein- phosphatase-mediated protection of intestinal epithelial barrier function.</a></h1><p>The gene locus encoding protein- phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Expression of the PTPN2 gene product, T cell protein- phosphatase (TCPTP), in intestinal epithelial cells has been shown to play an important role in the protection of epithelial barrier function during periods of inflammation by acting as a negative regulator of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-γ. Therefore, agents that increase the activity of TCPTP are of general interest as modifiers of inflammatory signaling events. A previous study demonstrated that the small molecule spermidine is a selective activator of TCPTP in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate whether activation of TCPTP by spermidine was capable of alleviating IFN-γ-induced, proinflammatory signaling and barrier dysfunction in human intestinal epithelial cells. Studies revealed that treatment of T84 and HT29/cl.19A colonocytes with spermidine increased both TCPTP protein levels and enzymatic activity, correlating with a decrease in the phosphorylation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 and 3, downstream mediators of IFN-γ signaling, upon coadministration of spermidine to IFN-γ-treated cells. On a functional level, spermidine protected barrier function in the setting of inflammation, restricting the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in epithelial permeability induced by IFN-γ in coincubation experiments. These data implicate spermidine as a potential therapeutic agent to treat conditions associated with elevated IFN-γ signaling and a faulty mucosal barrier.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22681978>Elucidating the signaling mechanism of an epithelial  opening induced by chitosan.</a></h1><p>Chitosan (CS) and its derivatives have been investigated as paracellular permeation enhancers for facilitating the oral bioavailability of hydrophilic macromolecules. As is well known, CS can transiently open the  (TJs) between epithelial cells, thus enhancing the paracellular permeability. However, the signaling mechanism that is related to the effect of CS on TJs remains unclear. Therefore, this study elucidates the potential transduction cascade of TJ opening in Caco-2 cell monolayers subsequent to CS exposure. Experimental results indicate that activation of integrin receptors on cell membranes significantly contributes to CS-mediated TJ disruption, initiating the cascade of TJ opening. Additionally, treatment of Caco-2 cell monolayers with CS leads to the clustering of integrins along the cell border, phosphorylation of FAK and Src  kinases, and results in the regulation of TJ permeability via the redistribution of TJ protein CLDN4 from the cell membrane to the cytosol. Elucidating the signaling mechanism of CS-induced TJ opening in intestinal cells significantly contributes to efforts to use CS and its derivatives as paracellular permeation enhancers.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Changes in epithelial resistance, apoptosis signaling molecules, and tight junction (TJ) protein phosphorylation in response to a 2°C rise in body temperature were determined with the use of Caco-2 and HT29 intestinal cells.Body temperature increased 2°C, and gut permeability (5-h urinary lactulose:rhamnose ratios) increased 3-fold after exercise (from 0.32 ± 0.016 baseline to 1.0 ± 0.017 at 14 d; P < 0.01). ZnC or colostrum truncated the rise by 70% after 14 d of treatment. The combination treatment gave an additional benefit, and truncated exercise induced increase at 2 d (30% reduction; P < 0.01). A 2°C temperature rise in in vitro studies caused the doubling of apoptosis and reduced epithelial resistance 3-4-fold. ZnC or colostrum truncated these effects (35-50%) with the greatest response seen with the combination treatment (all P < 0.01). Mechanisms of action included increasing heat shock protein 70 and truncating temperature-induced changes in B cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 associated X protein α and B cell lymphoma 2. ZnC also increased total occludin and reduced phosphorylated  claudin, phosphorylated  occludin, and phosphorylated serine occludin, thereby enhancing the TJ formation and stabilization.ZnC, taken alone or with colostrum, increased epithelial resistance and the TJ structure and may have value for athletes and in the prevention of heat stroke in military personnel.

Adult male db/db T2DM and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and sacrificed 24 hours after MCAo. T2DM-mice exhibited significantly increased blood glucose, brain hemorrhagic rate, mortality and cerebrovascular density, but decreased cerebrovascular diameter, arteriolar density and arterial mural cell numbers in the ischemic brain compared with WT mice. The hemorrhagic rate was significantly correlated with the mortality (r = 0.85). T2DM-mice also exhibited increased blood-brain barrier leakage and concomitantly, increased Angiopoietin2, but decreased Angiopoietin1, Tie2 and  protein expression in the ischemic brain. Angiopoietin1 gene expression also significantly decreased in the common carotid artery (CCA) in T2DM-mice compared with WT mice after stroke. To further test the effects of T2DM on cerebrovascular damage, we performed in vitro studies. The capillary-like tube formation of primary cultured mouse brain endothelial cells (MBECs) significantly increased, but artery cell migration in the primary CCA cultures significantly decreased both in Sham and MCAo T2DM-mice compared with the WT mice. Angiopoietin1 treatment significantly increased artery cell migration in T2DM-CCA after MCAo. Tie2-FC, a neutralized Tie2 antibody, significantly decreased artery cell migration in WT-CCA after MCAo. Therefore, decreased Angiopoietin1/Tie2 and increased Angiopoietin2 expression may contribute to diabetes-induced vascular damage after stroke.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We propose that a pro-inflammatory intestinal milieu, due to intestinal hyper-permeability and/or microbial dysbiosis, initiates or exacerbates PD pathogenesis. One factor that can cause intestinal hyper-permeability and dysbiosis is chronic stress which has been shown to accelerate neuronal degeneration and motor deficits in Parkinsonism rodent models. We hypothesized that stress-induced intestinal  dysfunction and microbial dysbiosis lead to a pro-inflammatory milieu that exacerbates the PD phenotype in the low-dose oral rotenone PD mice model. To test this hypothesis, mice received unpredictable restraint stress (RS) for 12 weeks, and during the last six weeks mice also received a daily administration of low-dose rotenone (10 mg/kg/day) orally. The initial six weeks of RS caused significantly higher urinary cortisol, intestinal hyperpermeability, and decreased abundance of putative "anti-inflammatory" bacteria (Lactobacillus) compared to non-stressed mice. Rotenone alone (i.e., without RS) disrupted the colonic expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1, increased oxidative stress (N-), increased myenteric plexus enteric glial cell GFAP expression and increased α-synuclein (α-syn) protein levels in the colon compared to controls. Restraint stress exacerbated these rotenone-induced changes. Specifically, RS potentiated rotenone-induced effects in the colon including: 1) intestinal hyper-permeability, 2) disruption of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin1), 3) oxidative stress (N-), 4) inflammation in glial cells (GFAP + enteric glia cells), 5) α-syn, 6) increased relative abundance of fecal Akkermansia (mucin-degrading Gram-negative bacteria), and 7) endotoxemia. In addition, RS promoted a number of rotenone-induced effects in the brain including: 1) reduced number of resting microglia and a higher number of dystrophic/phagocytic microglia as well as (FJ-C+) dying cells in the substantia nigra (SN), 2) increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) reactivity in the SN, and 3) reduced dopamine (DA) and DA metabolites (DOPAC, HVA) in the striatum compared to control mice. Our findings support a model in which chronic stress-induced, gut-derived, pro-inflammatory milieu exacerbates the PD phenotype via a dysfunctional microbiota-gut-brain axis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The current study investigated whether acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC) could ameliorate the pathology seen in an in vivoin vivo chronic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. Four treatment groups were included: 1) CONTROL receiving probenecid (PROB; 250 mg/kg) only, 2) MPTP (25 mg/kg) + PROB, 3) MPTP + ALC (100 mg/kg), and 4) ALC alone. MPTP-induced losses in  hydroxylase and DA transporter immunoreactivity in the SNc and CPu were significantly reduced by ALC. HPLC data further suggests that decreases in CPu DA levels produced by MPTP were also attenuated by ALC. Additionally, microglial activation and astrocytic reactivity induced by MPTP were greatly reduced by ALC, indicating protection against neuroinflammation. Glucose transporter-1 and the tight junction proteins occludin and zonula occludins-1 were also protected from MPTP-induced down-regulation by ALC. Together, data suggest that in this model, ALC protects against MPTP-induced damage to endothelial cells and loss of DA neurons in the SNc and CPu, suggesting that ALC therapy may have the potential to slow or ameliorate the progression of PD pathology in a clinical setting.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24254220>Effects of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide on blood-brain barrier and dopaminergic neurons of rats with lipopolysaccharide-induced Parkinson's disease.</a></h1><p>Neuro-inflammation and dysfunction of blood-brain barrier play an important role in the occurrence, development, and neuronal degeneration of Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies have demonstrated that a variety of cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β destroy the structure and function of blood-brain barrier. The damage to blood-brain barrier results in death of dopaminergic neurons, while protection of blood-brain barrier slows down the progression of PD. Also, it has been shown that activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) plays an important role in causing damage to blood-brain barrier. In addition, the PARP inhibitor 3-AB has been shown to protect blood-brain barrier from damage and has neuroprotective effects. In this study, using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PD rat model, we investigated whether 3-AB protects blood-brain barrier and dopaminergic neurons from functional damage. LPS significantly increased Evans blue content in the substantia nigra which peaked at 12 h, while administration of 3-AB significantly inhibited the LPS-induced increase in Evans blue content and also significantly increased the expression of the -associated proteins claudin-5, occludin and ZO-1. 3-AB also increased the number of  hydroxylase positive cells and reduced the IL-1β and TNF-α content significantly. According to western blot analysis, 3-AB significantly reduced the p-ERK1/2 expression, while the expression of p-p38MAPK increased. These results suggest that 3-AB protects the blood-brain barrier from functional damage in an LPS-induced PD rat model and dopaminergic neurons are protected from degeneration by upregulation of -associated proteins. These protective effects of 3-AB may be related to modulation of the ERK1/2 pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25149679>The angiopoietin1-Akt pathway regulates barrier function of the cultured spinal cord microvascular endothelial cells through Eps8.</a></h1><p>In mammalian central nervous system (CNS), the integrity of the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB), formed by  (TJs) between adjacent microvascular endothelial cells near the basement membrane of capillaries and the accessory structures, is important for relatively independent activities of the cellular constituents inside the spinal cord. The barrier function of the BSCB are tightly regulated and coordinated by a variety of physiological or pathological factors, similar with but not quite the same as its counterpart, the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Herein, angiopoietin 1 (Ang1), an identified ligand of the endothelium-specific  kinase receptor Tie-2, was verified to regulate barrier functions, including permeability,  protein interactions and F-actin organization, in cultured spinal cord microvascular endothelial cells (SCMEC) of rat through the activity of Akt. Besides, these roles of Ang1 in the BSCB in vitro were found to be accompanied with an increasing expression of epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (Eps8), an F-actin bundling protein. Furthermore, the silencing of Eps8 by lentiviral shRNA resulted in an antagonistic effect vs. Ang1 on the endothelial barrier function of SCMEC. In summary, the Ang1-Akt pathway serves as a regulator in the barrier function modulation of SCMEC via the actin-binding protein Eps8.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Throughout pregnancy, the placenta forms a critical antimicrobial protective barrier at the maternal-fetal interface. Despite the severity of diseases accompanying fetal CVB infections, little is known regarding the strategies used by CVB to gain entry into placental trophoblasts. Here we used both a trophoblast cell line and primary human trophoblasts to demonstrate the mechanism by which CVB gains entry into polarized placental trophoblasts. Our studies revealed that the kinetics of CVB entry into placental trophoblasts are similar to those previously described for polarized intestinal epithelial cells. Likewise, CVB entry into placental trophoblasts requires decay-accelerating factor (DAF) binding and involves relocalization of the virus from the apical surface to intercellular . In contrast, we have identified a divergent mechanism for CVB entry into polarized trophoblasts that is clathrin, caveolin-1, and dynamin II independent but requires intact lipid rafts. In addition, we found that members of the Src family of  kinases were required for CVB entry. Our studies highlight the complexity of viral entry into human placental trophoblasts and may serve as a model for mechanisms used by diverse pathogens to penetrate the placental barrier.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30320600>Thirty-eight-negative kinase 1 mediates trauma-induced intestinal injury and multi-organ failure.</a></h1><p>Dysregulated intestinal epithelial apoptosis initiates gut injury, alters the intestinal , and can facilitate bacterial translocation leading to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and/or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). A variety of gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease, have been linked to intestinal apoptosis. Similarly, intestinal hyperpermeability and gut failure occur in critically ill patients, putting the gut at the center of SIRS pathology. Regulation of apoptosis and immune-modulatory functions have been ascribed to Thirty-eight-negative kinase 1 (TNK1), whose activity is regulated merely by expression. We investigated the effect of TNK1 on intestinal  and its role in MODS. TNK1 expression induced crypt-specific apoptosis, leading to bacterial translocation, subsequent septic shock, and early death. Mechanistically, TNK1 expression in vivo resulted in STAT3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of p65, and release of IL-6 and TNF-α. A TNF-α neutralizing antibody partially blocked development of intestinal damage. Conversely, gut-specific deletion of TNK1 protected the intestinal mucosa from experimental colitis and prevented cytokine release in the gut. Finally, TNK1 was found to be deregulated in the gut in murine and porcine trauma models and human inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, TNK1 might be a target during MODS to prevent damage in several organs, notably the gut.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24927150>Marine natural products-inspired phenylmethylene hydantoins with potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities via suppression of Brk and FAK signaling.</a></h1><p>Breast and prostate cancers are among the most common cancers worldwide with devastating statistics for the metastatic, chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-resistant phenotypes. Novel therapies interfering with new and/or multiple pathways involved in the pathology of cancer are urgently needed. Preliminary results showed that the marine natural product Z-4-hydroxyphenylmethylene hydantoin (PMH, ) and its 4-ethylthio-analog (SEth, ) promoted  formation and showed anti-invasive and anti-migratory activities in vitro against metastatic prostate cancer cells and inhibited tumor growth and micrometastases in distant organs in orthotopic and transgenic mice models. This study focuses on the design and synthesis of second-generation PMHs with enhanced antitumor activities. A series of substituted benzaldehydes was selected based on earlier SAR studies and reacted with hydantoin to yield 11 new compounds . Compounds were evaluated for their antiproliferative, antimigratory and anti-invasive properties in vitro against the human mammary and prostate cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and PC-3, respectively. A Western blot analysis of the most active analog showed its ability to suppress the expression of the total levels of c-Met and FAK, with subsequent reduction of their phosphorylated (activated) levels in MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, also inhibited Brk, paxillin and Rac1 phosphorylation. was formulated using hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin (HPCD) to improve its solubility and was further evaluated in a nude mice xenograft model using MDA-MB-231/GFP cells. PMH reduced breast tumor growth and suppressed Ki-67, CD31, p-Brk and p-FAK expression in tumor samples.

FAK is an integrated component of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) involved in regulating Sertoli cell adhesion via its effects on the occludin-zonula occludens-1 complex. Herein, we report that p-FAK-Tyr(407) and p-FAK-Tyr(397) display restricted spatiotemporal and almost mutually exclusive localization in the epithelium, affecting BTB dynamics antagonistically, with the former promoting and the latter disrupting the Sertoli cell -permeability barrier function. Using primary cultured Sertoli cells as an in vitro model that mimics the BTB in vivo both functionally and ultrastructurally, effects of FAK phosphorylation on BTB function were studied by expressing nonphosphorylatable and phosphomimetic mutants, with  replaced by phenylalanine (F) and glutamate (E), respectively. Compared with WT FAK, Y407E and Y397F mutations each promoted barrier function, and the promoting effect of the Y407E mutant was abolished in the Y397E-Y407E double mutant, demonstrating antagonism between Tyr(407) and Tyr(397). Furthermore, Y407E mutation induced the recruitment of actin-related protein 3 to the Sertoli cell-cell interface, where it became more tightly associated with neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, promoting actin-related protein 2/3 complex activity. Conversely, Y407F mutation reduced the rate of actin polymerization at the Sertoli cell BTB. In summary, FAK-Tyr(407) phosphorylation promotes BTB integrity by strengthening the actin filament-based cytoskeleton. FAK serves as a bifunctional molecular "switch" to direct the cyclical disassembly and reassembly of the BTB during the epithelial cycle of spermatogenesis, depending on its phosphorylation status, to facilitate the transit of preleptotene spermatocytes across the BTB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24707128>How hepatitis C virus invades hepatocytes: the mystery of viral entry.</a></h1><p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global health problem, with an estimated 170 million people being chronically infected. HCV cell entry is a complex multi-step process, involving several cellular factors that trigger virus uptake into the hepatocytes. The high- density lipoprotein receptor scavenger receptor class B type I, tetraspanin CD81,  protein claudin-1, and occludin are the main receptors that mediate the initial step of HCV infection. In addition, the virus uses cell receptor  kinases as entry regulators, such as epidermal growth factor receptor and ephrin receptor A2. This review summarizes the current understanding about how cell surface molecules are involved in HCV attachment, internalization, and membrane fusion, and how host cell kinases regulate virus entry. The advances of the potential antiviral agents targeting this process are introduced.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24338688>Vascular endothelial  and barrier function are disrupted by 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid partly via protein kinase C ε-mediated zona occludens-1 phosphorylation at threonine 770/772.</a></h1><p>Disruption of  (TJs) perturbs endothelial barrier function and promotes inflammation. Previously, we have shown that 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HETE), the major 15-lipoxygenase 1 (15-LO1) metabolite of arachidonic acid, by stimulating zona occludens (ZO)-2  phosphorylation and its dissociation from claudins 1/5, induces endothelial TJ disruption and its barrier dysfunction. Here, we have studied the role of serine/threonine phosphorylation of TJ proteins in 15(S)-HETE-induced endothelial TJ disruption and its barrier dysfunction. We found that 15(S)-HETE enhances ZO-1 phosphorylation at Thr-770/772 residues via PKCε-mediated MEK1-ERK1/2 activation, causing ZO-1 dissociation from occludin, disrupting endothelial TJs and its barrier function, and promoting monocyte transmigration; these effects were reversed by T770A/T772A mutations. In the arteries of WT mice ex vivo, 15(S)-HETE also induced ZO-1 phosphorylation and endothelial TJ disruption in a PKCε and MEK1-ERK1/2-dependent manner. In line with these observations, in WT mice high fat diet feeding induced 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LO) expression in the endothelium and caused disruption of its TJs and barrier function. However, in 12/15-LO(-/-) mice, high fat diet feeding did not cause disruption of endothelial TJs and barrier function. These observations suggest that the 12/15-LO-12/15(S)-HETE axis, in addition to  phosphorylation of ZO-2, also stimulates threonine phosphorylation of ZO-1 in the mediation of endothelial TJ disruption and its barrier dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28029615>On Chip Bioelectric Impedance Spectroscopy Reveals the Effect of P-Glycoprotein Efflux Pumps on the Paracellular Impedance of  at the Blood-Brain Barrier.</a></h1><p>Bioelectric impedance spectroscopy was used to elucidate the influence of P-gp efflux pumps on the kinetics of  down-regulation in confluent monolayers of Madine Darby Canine Kidney Epithelial Cells (MDCK) following administration of phenylarsine oxide (PAO), a molecule that inhibits protein  phosphatases (PTP) and induces matrix metalloproteinase activity. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and phosphatase inhibitors induce modification of occludin  proteins critical for the proper function of the blood-brain barrier. The addition of PAO to MDCKII cell lines resulted in a dramatic decrease in monolayer resistance. In contrast, MDCKII-MDR1 cells transfected with the MDR1 gene treated with PAO showed an initial decrease in monolayer resistance followed by a partial recovery and subsequent decrease. This resistance decay reversal was suppressed with the addition of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) pump inhibitor elacridar, and is attributed to PAO efflux. These results illustrate impedance spectroscopy can be used to characterize the competing kinetics of efflux and down-regulation of . In addition, the resistance decay reversal effect can be used to evaluate P-gp pump inhibitor efficacy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30385692>Fas activation alters  proteins in acute lung injury.</a></h1><p>The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by protein-rich oedema in the alveolar spaces, a feature in which Fas-mediated apoptosis of the alveolar epithelium has been involved. To determine whether Fas activation increases protein permeability by mechanisms involving disruption of the paracellular  (TJ) proteins in the pulmonary alveoli.  Protein permeability and the expression of TJ proteins were assessed in vivo in wild-type and Fas-deficient lpr mice 16 hours after the intratracheal instillation of recombinant human soluble Fas ligand (rh-sFasL), and at different time points in vitro in human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiC) exposed to rh-sFasL Activation of the Fas pathway increased protein permeability in mouse lungs and altered the expression of the TJ proteins occludin and zonula occludens-1 in the alveolar-capillary membrane in vivo and in human alveolar epithelial cell monolayers in vitro. Blockade of caspase-3, but not inhibition of  kinase dependent pathways, prevented the alterations in TJ protein expression and permeability induced by the Fas/FasL system in human alveolar cell monolayers in vitro. We also observed that both the Fas-induced increase of protein permeability and disruption of TJ proteins occurred before cell death could be detected in the cell monolayers in vitro. Targeting caspase pathways could prevent the disruption of TJs and reduce the formation of lung oedema in the early stages of ARDS.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

Knockdown of Ca1.3 or TRPV6 channels blocked osmotic stress and DSS-induced ROS production and attenuated TJ disruption and barrier dysfunction. -Acetyl l-cysteine (NAC) and l--Nitroarginine methyl ester (l-NAME) blocked stress-induced TJ disruption and barrier dysfunction. NAC and l-NAME also blocked stress-induced activation of c-Jun -terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Src. ROS was colocalized with the mitochondrial marker in stressed cells. Cyclosporin A blocked osmotic stress and DSS-induced ROS production, barrier dysfunction, TJ disruption and JNK activation. Mitochondria-targeted Mito-TEMPO blocked osmotic stress and DSS-induced barrier dysfunction and TJ disruption. Chronic restraint stress in mice resulted in the elevation of intracellular Ca, activation of JNK and c-Src, and disruption of TJ in the colonic epithelium. Furthermore, corticosterone administration induced JNK and c-Src activation, TJ disruption and protein thiol oxidation in colonic mucosa.

Here, we explore its function and clinical relevance in human HCC.Stable transfection of the hepatocyte line HL7702 with CLDN9 was confirmed by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blotting, and immunofluorescence. The impact of CLDN9 on the cell invasion and migration was assessed in vitro by a transwell assay and wound-healing experiment. Western blotting was used to determine the activation state of the Tyk2 ( kinase 2)/Stat3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) pathway. Moreover, we used a Tyk2-RNAi assay to silence the expression of Tyk2 in CLDN9 expressing hepatocytes; subsequently, the impact of the Tyk2/Stat3 signaling pathway on the cell invasion and migration in vitro was assessed by a transwell assay and a wound-healing experiment. Furthermore, an immunohistochemistry method was utilized to explore the expression levels of CLDN9 and p-Stat3 in the HCC tissues and histologically non-neoplastic hepatic tissues.We confirmed that the expression of CLDN9 significantly enhanced the metastatic ability of hepatocytes in vitro, and the activation of the Stat3 pathway by Tyk2 was an important mechanism by which CLDN9 promoted hepatocyte aggressiveness in HCC.As an HCC proto-oncogene, CLDN9 affected the Stat3 signaling pathway via Tyk2 and ultimately enhanced the metastatic ability of hepatocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28776759>Melatonin ameliorates hypoglycemic stress-induced brain endothelial tight junction injury by inhibiting protein nitration of TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator.</a></h1><p>Severe hypoglycemia has a detrimental impact on the cerebrovasculature, but the molecular events that lead to the disruption of the integrity of the tight junctions remain unclear. Here, we report that the microvessel integrity was dramatically compromised (59.41% of wild-type mice) in TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) transgenic mice stressed by hypoglycemia. Melatonin, a potent antioxidant, protects against hypoglycemic stress-induced brain endothelial tight junction injury in the dosage of 400 nmol/L in vitro. FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) imaging data of endothelial cells stressed by low glucose revealed that TIGAR couples with calmodulin to promote TIGAR  nitration. A  92 mutation interferes with the TIGAR-dependent NADPH generation (55.60% decreased) and abolishes its protective effect on tight junctions in human brain microvascular endothelial cells. We further demonstrate that the low-glucose-induced disruption of occludin and Caludin5 as well as activation of autophagy was abrogated by melatonin-mediated blockade of nitrosative stress in vitro. Collectively, we provide information on the detailed molecular mechanisms for the protective actions of melatonin on brain endothelial tight junctions and suggest that this indole has translational potential for severe hypoglycemia-induced neurovascular damage.© 2017 The Authors.

A complex of the rhoptry neck proteins RONs 2/4/5/8 localize to the MJ during invasion where they are believed to provide a stable anchoring point for host penetration. During the initiation of invasion, the preformed MJ RON complex is injected into the host cell where RON2 spans the host plasma membrane while RONs 4/5/8 localize to its cytosolic face. While much attention has been directed toward an AMA1-RON2 interaction supposed to occur outside the cell, little is known about the functions of the MJ RONs positioned inside the host cell. Here we provide a detailed analysis of RON5 to resolve outstanding questions about MJ complex organization, assembly and function during invasion. Using a conditional knockdown approach, we show loss of RON5 results in complete degradation of RON2 and mistargeting of RON4 within the parasite secretory pathway, demonstrating that RON5 plays a key role in organization of the MJ RON complex. While RON8 is unaffected by knockdown of RON5, these parasites are unable to invade new host cells, providing the first genetic demonstration that RON5 plays a critical role in host cell penetration. Although invasion is not required for injection of rhoptry effectors into the host cytosol, parasites lacking RON5 also fail to form evacuoles suggesting an intact MJ complex is a prerequisite for secretion of rhoptry bulb contents. Additionally, while the MJ has been suggested to function in egress, disruption of the MJ complex by RON5 depletion does not impact this process. Finally, functional complementation of our conditional RON5 mutant reveals that while proteolytic separation of RON5 N- and C-terminal fragments is dispensable, a portion of the C-terminal domain is critical for RON2 stability and function in invasion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27824650>VSL#3 Probiotic Stimulates T-cell Protein  Phosphatase-mediated Recovery of IFN-γ-induced Intestinal Epithelial Barrier Defects.</a></h1><p>VSL#3 is a probiotic compound that has been used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. T-cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP) is the protein product of the inflammatory bowel disease candidate gene, PTPN2, and we have previously shown that it protects epithelial barrier function. The aim of this study was to investigate whether VSL#3 improves intestinal epithelial barrier function against the effects of the inflammatory bowel disease-associated proinflammatory cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) through activation of TCPTP.Polarized monolayers of T84 intestinal epithelial cells were treated with increasing concentrations of VSL#3 to determine effects on TCPTP expression and enzymatic activity. Therapeutic effects of VSL#3 against barrier disruption by IFN-γ were measured by transepithelial electrical resistance and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran permeability. A novel TCPTP-deficient HT-29 intestinal epithelial cell line was generated to study the role of TCPTP in mediating the effects of VSL#3.  protein distribution was assessed with confocal microscopy.VSL#3 increased TCPTP protein levels and enzymatic activity, correlating with a VSL#3-induced decrease in IFN-γ signaling. VSL#3 corrected the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in epithelial permeability induced by IFN-γ. Moreover, the restorative effect of VSL#3 against IFN-γ signaling, epithelial permeability defects, altered expression and localization of the  proteins claudin-2, occludin, and zonula occludens-1, were not realized in stable TCPTP/(PTPN2)-deficient HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells.VSL#3 reduces IFN-γ signaling and IFN-γ-induced epithelial barrier defects in a TCPTP-dependent manner. These data point to a key role for TCPTP as a therapeutic target for restoration of barrier function using probiotics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22326913>Host cell invasion by apicomplexans: what do we know?</a></h1><p>Apicomplexan zoites enter host cells by forming and actively moving through a  (TJ) formed between the parasite and host cell surfaces. Although the TJ was first described decades ago, its molecular characterization has proved difficult mainly because of its transient existence during an internalization process that lasts only seconds. In the past 7 years, work has led to a model of the TJ in which the association between AMA1 and RON proteins structures the TJ and bridges the cytoskeletons of the two cells. However, more recent work questions this view.

CaD is able to correct the excessive vascular permeability in the retina of diabetic patients and in experimental diabetes. We investigated the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of CaD against the increase in blood-retinal barrier (BRB) permeability induced by diabetes.Wistar rats were divided into three groups: controls, streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, and diabetic rats treated with CaD. The BRB breakdown was evaluated using Evans blue. The content or distribution of  proteins (occludin, claudin-5, and zonula occluden-1 [ZO-1]), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) was evaluated by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Leukocyte adhesion was evaluated in retinal vessels and in vitro. Oxidative stress was evaluated by the detection of oxidized carbonyls and  nitration. NF-κB activation was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Diabetes increased the BRB permeability and retinal thickness. Diabetes also decreased occludin and claudin-5 levels and altered the distribution of ZO-1 and occludin in retinal vessels. These changes were inhibited by CaD treatment. CaD also inhibited the increase in leukocyte adhesion to retinal vessels or endothelial cells and in ICAM-1 levels, induced by diabetes or elevated glucose. Moreover, CaD decreased oxidative stress and p38 MAPK and NF-κB activation caused by diabetes.CaD prevents the BRB breakdown induced by diabetes, by restoring  protein levels and organization and decreasing leukocyte adhesion to retinal vessels. The protective effects of CaD are likely to involve the inhibition of p38 MAPK and NF-κB activation, possibly through the inhibition of oxidative/nitrosative stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26237245>Tempol alleviates intracerebral hemorrhage-induced brain injury possibly by attenuating nitrative stress.</a></h1><p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)-induced brain injury leads to irreversible disruption of the blood-brain  (BBB) and fatality brain edema with massive cell death. Although secondary damage could, in principle, be preventable, no effective treatment approaches currently exist for patients with ICH. Tempol, a catalytic scavenger of peroxynitrite (ONOO)-derived free radicals, has been proven to ameliorate brain injury in several types of brain insults. This study aims to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of tempol after ICH and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Collagenase-induced ICH was performed in rats. Tempol was administered immediately after ICH. The effects of tempol on ICH were evaluated by assessing neurological deficits, BBB permeability, brain edema, and apoptotic cell death. The mechanisms of action of tempol, with its clear ability on the derivative of ONOO [3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), ONOO, and its derivative-mediated nitration marker] and expression of tight junction protein [zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1)], were also investigated. Perihematomal 3-NT increased significantly following ICH and expressed around vessels accompanied by reduced and discontinuous expression of ZO-1. Tempol treatment significantly suppressed 3-NT formation and preserved ZO-1 levels, and led to improvement in neurological outcomes and reduction of BBB leakiness, brain edema, and apoptosis. In conclusion, tempol has neuroprotective potential in experimental ICH and may help combat ICH-induced brain injury in patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27339140>N-cadherin relocalization during cardiac trabeculation.</a></h1><p>During cardiac trabeculation, cardiomyocytes delaminate from the outermost (compact) layer to form complex muscular structures known as trabeculae. As these cardiomyocytes delaminate, the remodeling of adhesion junctions must be tightly coordinated so cells can extrude from the compact layer while remaining in tight contact with their neighbors. In this study, we examined the distribution of N-cadherin (Cdh2) during cardiac trabeculation in zebrafish. By analyzing the localization of a Cdh2-EGFP fusion protein expressed under the control of the zebrafish cdh2 promoter, we initially observed Cdh2-EGFP expression along the lateral sides of embryonic cardiomyocytes, in an evenly distributed pattern, and with the occasional appearance of punctae. Within a few hours, Cdh2-EGFP distribution on the lateral sides of cardiomyocytes evolves into a clear punctate pattern as Cdh2-EGFP molecules outside the punctae cluster to increase the size of these aggregates. In addition, Cdh2-EGFP molecules also appear on the basal side of cardiomyocytes that remain in the compact layer. Delaminating cardiomyocytes accumulate Cdh2-EGFP on the surface facing the basal side of compact layer cardiomyocytes, thereby allowing tight adhesion between these layers. Importantly, we find that blood flow/cardiac contractility is required for the transition from an even distribution of Cdh2-EGFP to the formation of punctae. Furthermore, using time-lapse imaging of beating hearts in conjunction with a Cdh2 tandem fluorescent protein timer transgenic line, we observed that Cdh2-EGFP molecules appear to move from the lateral to the basal side of cardiomyocytes along the cell membrane, and that Erb-b2 receptor  kinase 2 (Erbb2) function is required for this relocalization.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23023872>Effect of cellular senescence on the albumin permeability of blood-derived endothelial cells.</a></h1><p>In this study, we tested the hypotheses that endothelial cells (ECs) derived from human umbilical cord blood (hCB-ECs) exhibit low permeability, which increases as hCB-ECs age and undergo senescence, and that the change in the permeability of hCB-ECs is due to changes in  protein localization and the activity of exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac)1. Albumin permeability across low-passage hCB-EC monolayers on Transwell membranes was 10 times lower than for human aortic ECs (HAECs) (P < 0.01) but similar to in vivo values in arteries. Expression of the  protein occludin and  phosphorylation of occludin were less in hCB-ECs than in HAECs (P < 0.05). More hCB-ECs than HAECs underwent mitosis (P < 0.01). hCB-ECs that underwent >44 population doublings since isolation had a significantly higher permeability than hCB-ECs that underwent <31 population doublings (P < 0.05). This age-related increase in hCB-EC permeability was associated with an increase in  phosphorylation of occludin (P < 0.01); permeability and occludin phosphorylation were reduced by treatment with 2 μM resveratrol.  phosphorylation of occludin and cell age influence the permeability of hCB-ECs, whereas levels of EC proliferation and expression of  proteins did not explain the differences between hCB-EC and HAEC permeability. The elevated permeability in late passage hCB-ECs was reduced by 25-40% by elevation of membrane-associated cAMP and activation of the Epac1 pathway. Given the similarity to in vivo permeability to albumin and the high proliferation potential, hCB-ECs may be a suitable in vitro model to study transport-related pathologies and cell aging.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23064287>Focal adhesion kinase regulates intestinal epithelial barrier function via redistribution of .</a></h1><p>Disruption of epithelial barrier function was identified as one of the pathologic mechanisms in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Epithelial barrier consists of various intercellular , in which the  (TJ) is an important component. However, the regulatory mechanism of  is still not clear. Here we examined the role of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in the epithelial barrier function on Caco-2 monolayers using a specific FAK inhibitor, PF-573, 228 (PF-228). We found that the decrease of transepithelial resistance and the increase of paracellular permeability were accompanied with the inhibition of autophosphorylation of FAK by PF-228 treatment. In addition, PF-228 inhibited the FAK phosphorylation at Y576/577 on activation loop by Src, suggesting Src-dependent regulation of FAK in Caco-2 monolayers. In an ethanol-induced barrier injury model, PF-228 treatment also inhibited the recovery of transepithelial resistance as well as these phosphorylations of FAK. In a sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, FAK co-localized with claudin-1, an element of the TJ complex, and they co-migrate after ethanol-induced barrier injury. Immunofluorescence imaging analysis revealed that PF-228 inhibited the FAK redistribution to the cell border and reassembly of TJ proteins in the recovery after ethanol-induced barrier injury. Finally, knockdown of FAK by siRNA resulted in the decrease of transepithelial resistance. These findings reveal that activation of FAK is necessary for maintaining and repairing epithelial barrier in Caco-2 cell monolayer via regulating TJ redistribution.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike other blood-tissue barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier and the blood-ocular (or blood-retina) barrier which formed by  (TJ) between endothelial cells of the microvessels, the BTB is constituted by coexisting TJ, basal ectoplasmic specialization (basal ES), desmosomes and gap  between adjacent Sertoli cells near the basement membrane of the seminiferous tubule. The BTB also divides the seminiferous epithelium into the apical (or adluminal) and basal compartments so that meiosis I and II and post-meiotic germ cell development can all take place in a specialized microenvironment in the apical compartment behind the BTB. While the unusual anatomical features of the BTB have been known for decades, the physiological function of the coexisting , in particular the desmosome and gap , that constitute the BTB was unknown until recently. Based on recently published findings, we critically evaluate the role of the desmosome and gap  that serve as a signaling platform to coordinate the "opening" and "closing" of the TJ-permeability barrier conferred by TJ and basal ES during the seminiferous epithelial cycle of spermatogenesis. This is made possible by polarity proteins working in concert with nonreceptor protein  kinases, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and c-Src, at the site to regulate endosome-mediated protein trafficking events (e.g., endocytosis, transcytosis, recycling or protein degradation). These events not only serve to destabilize the existing "old" BTB above preleptotene spermatocytes in transit in "clones" at the BTB, but also contribute to the assembly of "new" BTB below the transiting spermatocytes. Furthermore, hemidesmosomes at the Sertoli cell-basement membrane interface also contribute to the BTB restructuring events at stage VIII of the epithelial cycle. Additionally, the findings that a gap  at the BTB provides a possible route for the passage of toxicants [e.g., bisphenol A (BPA)] and potential male contraceptives (e.g., adjudin) across the BTB also illustrate that these coexisting , while helpful to maintain the immunological barrier integrity during the transit of spermatocytes, can be the "gateway" to making the BTB so vulnerable to toxicants and/or chemicals, causing male reproductive dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31240601>NMDA Receptors Regulate Neuregulin 2 Binding to ER-PM  and Ectodomain Release.</a></h1><p>Unprocessed pro-neuregulin 2 (pro-NRG2) accumulates on neuronal cell bodies at  between the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane (ER-PM ). NMDA receptors (NMDARs) trigger NRG2 ectodomain shedding from these sites followed by activation of ErbB4 receptor  kinases, and ErbB4 signaling cell-autonomously downregulates intrinsic excitability of GABAergic interneurons by reducing voltage-gated sodium channel currents. NMDARs also promote dispersal of Kv2.1 clusters from ER-PM  and cause a hyperpolarizing shift in its voltage-dependent channel activation, suggesting that NRG2/ErbB4 and Kv2.1 work together to regulate intrinsic interneuron excitability in an activity-dependent manner. Here we explored the cellular processes underlying NMDAR-dependent NRG2 shedding in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We report that NMDARs control shedding by two separate but converging mechanisms. First, NMDA treatment disrupts binding of pro-NRG2 to ER-PM  by post-translationally modifying conserved Ser/Thr residues in its intracellular domain. Second, using a mutant NRG2 protein that cannot be modified at these residues and that fails to accumulate at ER-PM , we demonstrate that NMDARs also directly promote NRG2 shedding by ADAM-type metalloproteinases. Using pharmacological and shRNA-mediated knockdown, and metalloproteinase overexpression, we unexpectedly find that ADAM10, but not ADAM17/TACE, is the major NRG2 sheddase acting downstream of NMDAR activation. Together, these findings reveal how NMDARs exert  control over the NRG2/ErbB4 signaling pathway, and suggest that NRG2 and Kv2.1 are co-regulated components of a shared pathway that responds to elevated extracellular glutamate levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22369552>Modulation of epithelial  by TGF-beta 3 in cultured oral epithelial cells.</a></h1><p>Previous studies have indicated that transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF-β3) was strongly expressed both in the gingival epithelium and the poorly structured pocket epithelium.A comprehensive analysis of the profile of  proteins was carried out by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, Western blot and paracellular permeability assays.Active TGF-β3 protein added to monolayers of cultured oral epithelial cells initially reduced the permeability to dextran (10 kDa), followed by an increase in permeability. Three hours after the addition of TGF-β3, expression of genes encoding  components was selectively up- or down-regulated. In addition, up- or down-regulation of expression of several  associated proteins was observed, although the protein changes did not parallel changes in gene expression. To confirm that TGF-β3 plays a role in epithelial barrier function, a selective Src family kinase inhibitor saracatinib (AZD0530) was added to cells treated with active TGF-β3.  proteins claudins-2, -20 and ZO-2 were significantly decreased, but claudin-4 and -18 were significantly increased.These results suggest that TGF-β3 is involved in the modulation of epithelial barrier function by regulating assembly of .© 2012 Australian Dental Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625033>Role of JAM-A  phosphorylation in epithelial barrier dysfunction during intestinal inflammation.</a></h1><p>Junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A), an epithelial  protein, plays an important role in regulating intestinal permeability through association with a scaffold signaling complex containing ZO-2, Afadin, and the small GTPase Rap2. Under inflammatory conditions, we report that the cytoplasmic tail of JAM-A is  phosphorylated (p-Y280) in association with loss of barrier function. While barely detectable Y280 phosphorylation was observed in confluent monolayers of human intestinal epithelial cells under basal conditions, exposure to cytokines TNFα, IFNγ, IL-22, or IL-17A, resulted in compromised barrier function in parallel with increased p-Y280. Phosphorylation was Src kinase dependent, and we identified Yes-1 and PTPN13 as a major kinase and phosphatase for p-JAM-A Y280, respectively. Moreover, cytokines IL-22 or IL-17A induced increased activity of Yes-1. Furthermore, the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 rescued cytokine-induced epithelial barrier defects and inhibited phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 in vitro. Phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 and increased permeability correlated with reduced JAM-A association with active Rap2. Finally, we observed increased phosphorylation of Y280 in colonic epithelium of individuals with ulcerative colitis and in mice with experimentally induced colitis. These findings support a novel mechanism by which  phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 regulates epithelial barrier function during inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21256972>c-Yes regulates cell adhesion at the blood-testis barrier and the apical ectoplasmic specialization in the seminiferous epithelium of rat testes.</a></h1><p>During spermatogenesis, extensive  restructuring takes place at the blood-testis barrier (BTB) and the Sertoli cell-spermatid interface known as the apical ectoplasmic specialization (apical ES, a testis-specific adherens ) in the seminiferous epithelium. However, the mechanism(s) that regulates these critical events in the testis remains unknown. Based on the current concept in the field, changes in the phosphorylation status of integral membrane proteins at these sites can induce alterations in protein endocytosis and recycling, causing  restructuring. Herein, c-Yes, a non-receptor protein  kinase, was found to express abundantly at the BTB and apical ES stage-specifically, coinciding with  restructuring events at these sites during the seminiferous epithelial cycle of spermatogenesis. c-Yes also structurally associated with adhesion proteins at the BTB (e.g., occludin and N-cadherin) and the apical ES (e.g., β1-integrin, laminins β3 and γ3), possibly to regulate phosphorylation status of proteins at these sites. SU6656, a selective c-Yes inhibitor, was shown to perturb the Sertoli cell -permeability barrier in vitro, which is mediated by changes in the distribution of occludin and N-cadherin at the cell-cell interface, moving from cell surface to cytosol, thereby destabilizing the -barrier. However, this disruptive effect of SU6656 on the barrier was blocked by testosterone. Furthermore, c-Yes is crucial to maintain the actin filament network in Sertoli cells since a blockade of c-Yes by SU6656 induced actin filament disorganization.

However, the BTB undergoes extensive restructuring at stage VIII of the epithelial cycle to facilitate the transit of preleptotene spermatocytes and to prepare for meiosis. This action thus prompted us to investigate whether this stage can be a physiological window for the delivery of therapeutic and/or contraceptive drugs across the BTB to exert their effects at the immune-privileged site. Herein, we report findings that P-glycoprotein, an ATP-dependent efflux drug transporter and an integrated component of the occludin/zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) adhesion complex at the BTB, structurally interacted with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), creating the occludin/ZO-1/FAK/P-glycoprotein regulatory complex. Interestingly, a knockdown of P-glycoprotein by RNAi was found to impede Sertoli cell BTB function, making the  (TJ) barrier "leaky." This effect was mediated by changes in the protein phosphorylation status of occludin via the action of FAK, thereby affecting the endocytic vesicle-mediated protein trafficking events that destabilized the TJ barrier. However, the silencing of P-glycoprotein, although capable of impeding drug transport across the BTB and TJ permeability barrier function, was not able to induce the BTB to be "freely" permeable to adjudin. These findings indicate that P-glycoprotein is involved in BTB restructuring during spermatogenesis but that P-glycoprotein-mediated restructuring does not "open up" the BTB to make it freely permeable to drugs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21302304>Stabilization of brain microvascular endothelial barrier function by shear stress involves VE-cadherin signaling leading to modulation of pTyr-occludin levels.</a></h1><p>Blood-brain barrier (BBB) regulation involves the coordinated interaction of intercellular adherens and  in response to stimuli. One such stimulus, shear stress, has been shown to upregulate brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMvEC) barrier function, although our knowledge of the signaling mechanisms involved is limited. In this article, we examined the hypothesis that VE-cadherin can transmit shear signals to  occludin with consequences for pTyr-occludin and barrier function. In initial studies, chronic shear enhanced membrane localization of ZO-1 and claudin-5, decreased pTyr-occludin (in part via a dephostatin-sensitive mechanism), and reduced BMvEC permeability, with flow reduction in pre-sheared BMvECs having converse effects. In further studies, VE-cadherin inhibition (VE-cad ΔEXD) blocked shear-induced Rac1 activation, pTyr-occludin reduction, and barrier upregulation, consistent with an upstream role for VE-cadherin in transmitting shear signals to  through Rac1. As VE-cadherin is known to mediate Rac1 activation via Tiam1 recruitment, we subsequently confirmed that Tiam1 inhibition (Tiam1-C580) could elicit effects similar to VE-cad ΔEXD. Finally, the observed attenuation of shear-induced changes in pTyr-occludin level and barrier phenotype following Rac1 inhibition (NSC23766, T17N) establishes a downstream role for Rac1 in this pathway. In summary, we describe for the first time in BMvECs a role for VE-cadherin in the transmission of physiological shear signals to  occludin through engagement of Tiam1/Rac1 leading to barrier stabilization. A downstream role is also strongly indicated for a protein  phosphatase in pTyr-occludin modulation. Importantly, these findings suggest an important route of inter-junctional signaling cross-talk during BBB response to flow.Copyright © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28328972>Altered gut microbiome in a mouse model of Gulf War Illness causes neuroinflammation and intestinal injury via leaky gut and TLR4 activation.</a></h1><p>Many of the symptoms of Gulf War Illness (GWI) that include neurological abnormalities, neuroinflammation, chronic fatigue and gastrointestinal disturbances have been traced to Gulf War chemical exposure. Though the association and subsequent evidences are strong, the mechanisms that connect exposure to intestinal and neurological abnormalities remain unclear. Using an established rodent model of Gulf War Illness, we show that chemical exposure caused significant dysbiosis in the gut that included increased abundance of phylum Firmicutes and Tenericutes, and decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes. Several gram negative bacterial genera were enriched in the GWI-model that included Allobaculum sp. Altered microbiome caused significant decrease in  protein Occludin with a concomitant increase in Claudin-2, a signature of a leaky gut. Resultant leaching of gut caused portal endotoxemia that led to upregulation of toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation in the small intestine and the brain. TLR4 knock out mice and mice that had gut decontamination showed significant decrease in  nitration and inflammatory mediators IL1β and MCP-1 in both the small intestine and frontal cortex. These events signified that gut dysbiosis with simultaneous leaky gut and systemic endotoxemia-induced TLR4 activation contributes to GW chemical-induced neuroinflammation and gastrointestinal disturbances.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26243458>CITED4 gene silencing in colorectal cancer cells modulates adherens/tight junction gene expression and reduces cell proliferation.</a></h1><p>CITED4 is one member of a family of transcriptional cofactors, several of which are deregulated in a variety of tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC). We modulated CITED4 expression, in vitro, and analyzed the associated phenotypic and gene expression changes.CITED4-overexpressing and shRNA-mediated knockdown cell lines and control cell lines were established in the CRC cell line SW480. The cells were analyzed for changes in proliferation, apoptosis/cell cycle, migration, invasion, colony formation and adhesion. mRNA expression changes were determined by microarray and pathway analysis, and several deregulated genes were validated by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Based on results obtained from these studies, the status of the actin cytoskeleton was evaluated by phalloidin/vinculin staining.Phenotypically, the CITED4-overexpressing cell line showed only moderate changes in adhesion. Microarray analysis identified several deregulated genes, including several G protein-coupled receptors. Phenotypic analysis of the CITED4 shRNA knockdown cell line demonstrated decreased cell proliferation and G2 cell cycle blockage. Microarray analysis identified many deregulated genes, and pathway analysis discovered genes linked to actin-associated adherens junctions/tight junctions (claudin-4, claudin-7, ezrin, MET, ß-catenin). Phenotypically, no morphological changes of the actin cytoskeleton were seen.Upregulation of CITED4 in SW480 resulted in no obvious phenotype. CITED4 shRNA-mediated knockdown led to decreased cellular proliferation and modulation of a large number of genes, including the c-MET  kinase and several actin-associated adherens junctions/tight junction genes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23589307>12/15-Lipoxygenase mediates high-fat diet-induced endothelial  disruption and monocyte transmigration: a new role for 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in endothelial cell dysfunction.</a></h1><p>A convincing body of evidence suggests that 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LO) plays a role in atherosclerosis. However, the mechanisms of its involvement in the pathogenesis of this disease are not clear. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to understand the mechanisms by which 12/15-LO mediates endothelial dysfunction. 15(S)-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HETE), the major 12/15-LO metabolite of arachidonic acid (AA), induced endothelial barrier permeability via Src and Pyk2-dependent zonula occluden (ZO)-2  phosphorylation and its dissociation from the  complexes. 15(S)-HETE also stimulated macrophage adhesion to the endothelial monolayer in Src and Pyk2-dependent manner. Ex vivo studies revealed that exposure of arteries from WT mice to AA or 15(S)-HETE led to Src-Pyk2-dependent ZO-2  phosphorylation,  disruption, and macrophage adhesion, whereas the arteries from 12/15-LO knock-out mice are protected from these effects of AA. Feeding WT mice with a high-fat diet induced the expression of 12/15-LO in the arteries leading to  disruption and macrophage adhesion and deletion of the 12/15-LO gene disallowed these effects. Thus, the findings of this study provide the first evidence of the role of 12/15-LO and its AA metabolite, 15(S)-HETE, in high-fat diet-induced endothelial  disruption and macrophage adhesion, the crucial events underlying the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23967870>Tranexamic acid accelerates skin barrier recovery and upregulates occludin in damaged skin.</a></h1><p>Tranexamic acid (TA) is a traditional plasmin inhibitor, and its role in the renovation of damaged skin has become the topic of a lot of research. The aim of this study is to determine whether TA could repair the skin barrier by means of  intercellular .Two kinds of damaged skin models were set up and subjected to repeated application of sodium lauryl sulfate and irradiation of ultraviolet B. Through bioengineering technology and immunohistochemistry tests, TA-induced changes in skin were detected.After 1, 3, 7, and 14 days of application, TA can significantly accelerate barrier recovery and decrease the melanin index values of ultraviolet B irritation skin. The mean optic density of occludin from TA treatment is higher than from self-repair.These experiments suggest that TA can accelerate skin barrier recovery and upregulate occludin induced by physicochemical damages of human skin, but it is advisable to perform more research on the upregulation of occludin in molecular mechanism in the future.© 2013 The International Society of Dermatology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320242>Noncanonical PAR3 activation by factor Xa identifies a novel pathway for Tie2 activation and stabilization of vascular integrity.</a></h1><p>Endothelial barrier protective effects of activated protein C (APC) require the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), protease-activated receptor (PAR) 1, and PAR3. In contrast, PAR1 and PAR3 activation by thrombin results in barrier disruption. Noncanonical PAR1 and PAR3 activation by APC vs canonical activation by thrombin provides an explanation for the functional selectivity of these proteases. Here we found that factor Xa (FXa) activated PAR1 at canonical Arg41 similar to thrombin but cleaved PAR3 at noncanonical Arg41 similar to APC. This unique PAR1-PAR3 activation profile permitted the identification of noncanonical PAR3 activation as a novel activation pathway for barrier protective tunica intima endothelial receptor  kinase 2 (Tie2). APC, FXa, and the noncanonical PAR3 tethered-ligand peptide induced prolonged activation of Tie2, whereas thrombin and the canonical PAR3 tethered-ligand peptide did not. Tie2 activation by FXa required PAR3 and EPCR. FXa and the noncanonical PAR3 tethered-ligand peptide induced Tie2- and PAR3-dependent upregulation of -associated protein zona occludens 1 (ZO-1), translocation of ZO-1 to cell-cell borders, and the formation of typical ZO-1 honeycomb patterns that are indicative of  stabilization. These data provide intriguing novel insights into the diversification of functional selectivity of protease signaling achievable by canonical and noncanonical PAR activation, such as the activation of vascular-protective Tie2 by noncanonical PAR3 activation.© 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26246326>Oral Glutamine Supplementation Protects Female Mice from Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>Genetic factors, a diet rich in fat and sugar, and an impaired intestinal  function are critical in the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The nonessential amino acid glutamine (Gln) has been suggested to have protective effects on intestinal  function but also against the development of liver diseases of various etiologies.The effect of oral Gln supplementation on the development of Western-style diet (WSD)-induced NASH in mice was assessed.Female 6- to 8-wk-old C57BL/6J mice were pair-fed a control (C) diet or a WSD alone or supplemented with 2.1 g l-Gln/kg body weight for 6 wk (C+Gln or WSD+Gln). Indexes of liver damage, lipid peroxidation, and glucose metabolism and endotoxin concentrations were measured.Although Gln supplementation had no effect on the loss of the tight junction protein occludin, the increased portal endotoxin and fasting glucose concentrations found in WSD-fed mice, markers of liver damage (e.g., nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score and number of neutrophils in the liver) were significantly lower in the WSD+Gln group than in the WSD group (~47% and ~60% less, respectively; P < 0.05). Concentrations of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein and 3-nitrotyrosin protein adducts were significantly higher in livers of WSD-fed mice than in all other groups (~8.6- and ~1.9-fold higher, respectively, compared with the C group; P < 0.05) but did not differ between WSD+Gln-, C-, and C+Gln-fed mice. Hepatic tumor necrosis factor α and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 concentrations were significantly higher in WSD-fed mice (~1.6- and ~1.8-fold higher, respectively; P < 0.05) but not in WSD+Gln-fed mice compared with C mice.Our data suggest that the protective effects of oral Gln supplementation on the development of WSD-induced NASH in mice are associated with protection against the induction of iNOS and lipid peroxidation in the liver.© 2015 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25204337>Remediation of hemorrhagic shock-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction by treatment with diphenyldihaloketones EF24 and CLEFMA.</a></h1><p>Gut is very sensitive to hypoperfusion and hypoxia, and deranged gastrointestinal barrier is implicated in systemic failure of various organs. We recently demonstrated that diphenyldihaloketone EF24 [3,5-bis(2-fluorobenzylidene)piperidin-4-one] improves survival in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock. In this study, we tested EF24 and its other analog CLEFMA (4-[3,5-bis(2-chlorobenzylidene)-4-oxo-piperidine-1-yl]-4-oxo-2-butenoic acid) for their effect on intestinal barrier dysfunction in hypovolemic shock. Hypovolemia was induced in rats by withdrawing 50% of blood. EF24 or CLEFMA (0.4 mg/kg i.p.) treatment was provided, without volume resuscitation, after 1 hour of hemorrhage. Ileum was collected 5 hours after the treatment to investigate the expression of  proteins (zonula occludens, claudin, and occludin) and epithelial injury markers [myeloperoxidase, ileal lipid-binding protein (ILBP), CD163, and plasma citrulline]. The ileal permeability for dextran-fluoroisothiocyanate and Evan's blue dye was determined. EF24 and CLEFMA reduced the hypovolemia-induced plasma citrulline levels and the ileal expression of myeloperoxidase, ILBP, and CD163. The drugs also restored the basal expression levels of zonula occludens, claudin, and occludin, which were substantially deranged by hypovolemia. In ischemic ileum, the expression of phospho()-zonula occludens-1 was reduced, which was reinstated by EF24 and CLEFMA. In contrast, the drug treatments maintained the hypovolemia-induced expression of phospho(threonine)-occludin, but reduced that of phospho()-occludin. Both EF24 and CLEFMA treatments reduced the intestinal permeability enhanced by hypovolemia. EF24 and CLEFMA attenuate hypovolemic gut pathology and protect barrier function by restoring the status of  proteins. These effects were observed in unresuscitated shock, implying the benefit of EF24 and CLEFMA in prehospital care of shock.Copyright © 2014 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23474739>Decreased expression of VE-cadherin and claudin-5 and increased phosphorylation of VE-cadherin in vascular endothelium in nasal polyps.</a></h1><p>VE-cadherin and claudin-5 are major components of adherens and  of vascular endothelial cells and a decrease in their expression and an increase in the -phosphorylation of VE-cadherin are associated with an increase in endothelial paracellular permeability. To clarify the mechanism underlying the development of edema in nasal polyps, we studied these molecules in polyp microvessels. Normal inferior turbinate mucosal tissues and nasal polyps from patients treated with or without glucocorticoid were stained for VE-cadherin or claudin-5 and CD31 by a double-immunofluorescence method and the immunofluorescence intensities were graded 1-3 with increasing intensity. To correct for differences in fluorescence intensity attributable to a different endothelial area being exposed in a section or to the thickness of a section, the relative immunofluorescence intensity was estimated by dividing the grade of VE-cadherin or claudin-5 by that of CD31 in each microvessel. -phosphorylation of VE-cadherin was examined by Western blot analysis. The relative intensities of VE-cadherin and claudin-5 in the CD31-positive microvessels significantly decreased in the following order; inferior turbinate mucosa, treated polyps and untreated polyps. The ratio of -phosphorylated VE-cadherin to VE-cadherin was significantly higher in untreated polyps than in the inferior turbinate mucosa and treated polyps, between which no significant difference in the ratio was seen. Thus, in nasal polyps, the barrier function of endothelial adherens and  is weakened, although glucocorticoid treatment improves this weakened barrier function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20470769>Prostanoid EP1 receptor antagonist reduces blood-brain barrier leakage after cerebral ischemia.</a></h1><p>Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) after cerebral ischemia is considered to be the initial step in the development of brain injuries, and an increase in the  phosphorylation of the  junctional protein occludin has been shown to cause an increase in BBB permeability. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) appears to be associated with both toxic and protective effects on neuronal survival in vitro. However, it remains to be determined whether the prostanoid EP1 receptor is involved in the disruption of the BBB after cerebral ischemia. So we examined the effect of a prostanoid EP1 receptor antagonist, SC51089, on BBB leakage and  phosphorylation of occludin after cerebral ischemia. We demonstrated that SC51089 attenuated the increase in the  phosphorylation of occludin in isolated brain capillaries, which was coincident with a decrease in BBB leakage. These results suggest that the prostanoid EP1 receptor is involved in the  phosphorylation of occludin at , which may lead to disruption of the BBB and be linked to the development of cerebral infarctions.Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Developing blood-brain barrier (BBB) is known to be a target of Pb neurotoxicity; however, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Recent evidence suggests that intracellular nonreceptor protein  kinase Src regulates  junctional proteins (TJPs). This study was designed to investigate whether Pb acted on the Src-mediated cascade event leading to an altered TJP expression at BBB. Rats aged 20-22 days were exposed to Pb in drinking water (0, 100, 200, and 300 ppm Pb) for eight weeks. Electron microscopic and Western blot analyses revealed a severe leakage of BBB and significantly decreased expressions of TJP occludin and ZO-1. When cultured brain endothelial RBE4 cells were exposed to 10μM Pb for 24 h, expressions of phosphor-Src and an upstream regulator GRP78 were significantly increased by 6.42-fold and 8.29-fold (p < 0.01), respectively. Inactivation of Src pathway by a Src-specific inhibitor reversed Pb-induced downregulation of occludin, but not ZO-1; small interfering RNA knockdown of GRP78 attenuated Pb-induced Src phosphorylation and occludin reduction. Furthermore, Pb exposure caused redistribution of GRP78 from endoplasmic reticulum to cytosol and toward cell member. However, the data from immunoneutralization studies did not show the involvement of cell-surface GRP78 in regulating Src phosphorylation upon Pb exposure, suggesting that the cytosolic GRP78, rather than cell-surface GRP78, was responsible to Pb-induced Src activation and ensuing occludin reduction. Taken together, this study provides the evidence of a novel linkage of GRP78, Src activation to downregulation of occludin, and BBB disruption during Pb exposure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23169788>c-Yes regulates cell adhesion at the apical ectoplasmic specialization-blood-testis barrier axis via its effects on protein recruitment and distribution.</a></h1><p>During spermatogenesis, extensive restructuring takes place at the cell-cell interface since developing germ cells migrate progressively from the basal to the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous epithelium. Since germ cells per se are not motile cells, their movement relies almost exclusively on the Sertoli cell. Nonetheless, extensive exchanges in signaling take place between these cells in the seminiferous epithelium. c-Yes, a nonreceptor protein  kinase belonging to the Src family kinases (SFKs) and a crucial signaling protein, was recently shown to be upregulated at the Sertoli cell-cell interface at the blood-testis barrier (BTB) at stages VIII-IX of the seminiferous epithelial cycle of spermatogenesis. It was also highly expressed at the Sertoli cell-spermatid interface known as apical ectoplasmic specialization (apical ES) at stage V to early stage VIII of the epithelial cycle during spermiogenesis. Herein, it was shown that the knockdown of c-Yes by RNAi in vitro and in vivo affected both Sertoli cell adhesion at the BTB and spermatid adhesion at the apical ES, causing a disruption of the Sertoli cell -permeability barrier function, germ cell loss from the seminiferous epithelium, and also a loss of spermatid polarity. These effects were shown to be mediated by changes in distribution and/or localization of adhesion proteins at the BTB (e.g., occludin, N-cadherin) and at the apical ES (e.g., nectin-3) and possibly the result of changes in the underlying actin filaments at the BTB and the apical ES. These findings implicate that c-Yes is a likely target of male contraceptive research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22787045>Blood-brain barrier permeability is increased after acute adult stroke but not neonatal stroke in the rat.</a></h1><p>The immaturity of the CNS at birth greatly affects injury after stroke but the contribution of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to the differential response to stroke in adults and neonates is poorly understood. We asked whether the structure and function of the BBB is disrupted differently in neonatal and adult rats by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. In adult rats, albumin leakage into injured regions was markedly increased during 2-24 h reperfusion but leakage remained low in the neonates. Functional assays employing intravascular tracers in the neonates showed that BBB permeability to both large (70 kDa dextran) and small (3 kDa dextran), gadolinium (III)-diethyltriaminepentaacetic acid tracers remained largely undisturbed 24 h after reperfusion. The profoundly different functional integrity of the BBB was associated with the largely nonoverlapping patterns of regulated genes in endothelial cells purified from injured and uninjured adult and neonatal brain at 24 h (endothelial transcriptome, 31,042 total probe sets). Within significantly regulated 1266 probe sets in injured adults and 361 probe sets in neonates, changes in the gene expression of the basal lamina components, adhesion molecules, the  protein occludin, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 were among the key differences. The protein expression of collagen-IV, laminin, claudin-5, occludin, and zonula occludens protein 1 was also better preserved in neonatal rats. Neutrophil infiltration remained low in acutely injured neonates but neutralization of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 in the systemic circulation enhanced neutrophil infiltration, BBB permeability, and injury. The markedly more integrant BBB in neonatal brain than in adult brain after acute stroke may have major implications for the treatment of neonatal stroke.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23760508>Conserved aromatic residue confers cation selectivity in claudin-2 and claudin-10b.</a></h1><p>In , both claudin-2 and claudin-10b form paracellular cation-selective pores by the interaction of the first ECL 1 with permeating ions. We hypothesized that a highly conserved aromatic residue near the pore selectivity filter of claudins contributes to cation selectivity by cation-π interaction with the permeating cation. To test this, we generated MDCK I Tet-off cells stably transfected with claudin-2 Tyr(67) mutants. The Y67L mutant showed reduced cation selectivity compared with wild-type claudin-2 due to a decrease in Na(+) permeability, without affecting the Cl(-) permeability. The Y67A mutant enlarged the pore size and further decreased the charge selectivity due to an increase in Cl(-) permeability. The Y67F mutant restored the Na(+) permeability, Cl(-) permeability, and pore size back to wild-type. The accessibility of Y67C to methanethiosulfonate modification indicated that its side chain faces the lumen of the pore. In claudin-10b, the F66L mutant reduced cation selectivity, and the F66A mutant lost pore conductance. We conclude that the conserved aromatic residue near the cation pore domain of claudins contributes to cation selectivity by a dual role of cation-π interaction and a luminal steric effect. Our findings provide new insight into how ion selectivity is achieved in the paracellular pore.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28715434>Engineered extracellular matrices with controlled mechanics modulate renal proximal tubular cell epithelialization.</a></h1><p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Recovery from many forms of AKI involves the proliferation of renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs), but the influence of the microenvironment in which this recovery occurs remains poorly understood. Here we report the development of a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel platform to study the influence of substrate mechanical properties on the proliferation of human RPTECs as a model for recovery from AKI. PEG diacrylate based hydrogels were generated with orthogonal control of mechanics and cell-substrate interactions. Using this platform, we found that increased substrate stiffness promotes RPTEC spreading and proliferation. RPTECs showed similar degrees of apoptosis and Yes-associated protein (YAP) nuclear localization regardless of stiffness, suggesting these were not key mediators of the effect. However, focal adhesion formation, cytoskeletal organization, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation were all enhanced with increasing substrate stiffness. Inhibition of ERK activation substantially attenuated the effect of stiffness on proliferation. In long-term culture, hydrogel stiffness promoted the formation of more complete epithelial monolayers with tight junctions, cell polarity, and an organized basement membrane. These data suggest that increased stiffness potentially may have beneficial consequences for the renal tubular epithelium during recovery from AKI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29512753>Identification of genes and pathways associated with MDR in MCF-7/MDR breast cancer cells by RNA-seq analysis.</a></h1><p>Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major problem in the treatment of breast cancer. In the present study, next-generation sequencing technology was employed to identify differentially expressed genes in MCF‑7/MDR cells and MCF‑7 cells, and aimed to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of MDR in breast cancer. Differentially expressed genes between MCF‑7/MDR and MCF‑7 cells were selected using software; a total of 2085 genes were screened as differentially expressed in MCF‑7/MDR cells. Furthermore, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed using the DAVID database. Finally, a protein‑protein interaction network was constructed and the hub genes in the network were analyzed using the STRING database. GO annotation demonstrated that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in various biological processes, including 'regulation of cell differentiation', 'cell development', 'neuron development', 'movement of cell or subcellular component' and 'cell morphogenesis involved in neuron differentiation'. Cellular component analysis by GO revealed that differentially expressed genes were enriched in 'plasma membrane region' and 'extracellular matrix' terms. Furthermore, KEGG analysis demonstrated that the target genes were enriched in various pathways, including 'cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)', 'calcium signaling pathway', '', 'Wnt signaling pathway' and 'pathways in cancer' terms. A protein‑protein interaction network demonstrated that certain hub genes, including cyclin D1, nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3), NOTCH3, brain‑derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), paired box 6, neuropeptide Y, phospholipase C β (PLCB) 4, PLCB2 and actin α cardiac muscle 1, may be associated with MDR in breast cancer. Subsequently, RT‑qPCR confirmed that the expression of these 9 hub genes was higher in MCF‑7/MDR cells compared with MCF‑7 cells, consistent with the RNA‑sequencing analysis. Additionally, a Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay demonstrated that specific inhibitors of NOS3 and BDNF/neurotrophic receptor  kinase, type 2 signaling reduced the IC50 of MCF‑7/MDR cells in response to various anticancer drugs, including adriamycin, cisplatin and 5‑fluorouracil. The results of the present study provide novel insights into the mechanism underlying MDR in MCF‑7 cells and may identify novel targets for the treatment of breast cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28991675>Sodium butyrate exerts protective effect against Parkinson's disease in mice via stimulation of glucagon like peptide-1.</a></h1><p>Sodium butyrate (NaB) has exhibited protective activity in neurological disorders. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective effect and potential mechanisms of NaB in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD). A mouse was intraperitoneally treated with MPTP (30mg/kg) for 7 consecutive days to induce PD model and NaB (200mg/kg) was intragastrically treated for 3weeks. The behavioral tests were then conducted. Dopaminergic degeneration was evaluated by western blot and immunohistochemistry of  hydroxylase (TH) in the SN. Brain damage was assessed by histologic (Nissl staining for cell death), apoptosis-associated protein and  (TJ) proteins studies. Meanwhile, the levels of colonic glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and cerebral GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) expression were assessed. Our results showed that NaB improved neurobehavioral impairment including cognitive behavior and coordination performance. Moreover, NaB treatment prevented the MPTP-induced dopaminergic degeneration and decreased expression level of TH in the striatum. NaB treatment attenuated the PD-associated disruption of BBB by upregulation of Occludin and zonula occludens (ZO)-1. In addition, NaB resulted in increased level of Bcl-2 and decreased level of Bax. Particularly, NaB-treated mice with PD exhibited increased colonic GLP-1 level as well as upregulation of brain GLP-1R expression compared with PD group. Our findings suggest that NaB has potential as a novel therapeutic for treatment of PD, and its mechanism was associated with stimulating colonic GLP-1secretion.Copyright © 2017.

To evaluate in vitro whether pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of respiratory disorders could alter TJ organization and epithelial barrier integrity, and to characterize the signal transduction pathway involved Calu-3 airway epithelial cells were exposed to TNF-a, IL-4 and IFN-g to assess changes in: (a) TJ assembly, that is, occludin and zonula occludens (ZO)-1 expression and localization, evaluated by confocal microscopy; (b) apoptotic activity, quantified using terminal transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling staining; (c) epithelial barrier integrity, detected as transmembrane electrical resistance and expressed as G(T) values; (d) epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-dependent mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2 phosphorylation, assessed by western blotting. Exposure to cytokines for 48 h induced a noticeable downregulation of the TJ transmembrane proteins. The degree ZO-1 and occludin colocalization was 62±2% in control cultures and significantly decreased in the presence of TNF-a (47±3%), IL-4 (43±1%) and INF-g (35±3%). Although no apoptosis induction was detected following exposure to cytokines, changes in the epithelial barrier integrity were observed, with a significant enhancement in paracellular conductance. G(T) values were, respectively, 1.030±0.0, 1.300±0.04, 1.260±0.020 and 2.220±0.015 (mS/cm²)1000 in control cultures and in those exposed to TNF-a, IFN-g and IL-4. The involvement of EGFR-dependent MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in cytokine-induced damage was demonstrated by a significant increase in threonine/ phosphorylation of ERK1/2, already detectable after 5 min incubation. All these cytokine-induced changes were markedly prevented when Calu-3 cells were cultured in the presence of an EGFR inhibitor (AG1478, 1 μM) or a MAP kinase inhibitor (U0126, 25 μM). In conclusion, cytokine-induced epithelial injury includes TJ disassembly and epithelial barrier permeability alteration and involves the EGFR-dependent MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496427>Identification and evaluation of glutathione conjugate gamma-l-glutamyl-l-cysteine for improved drug delivery to the brain.</a></h1><p>Glutathione (GU), an endogenous antioxidant tripeptide, is frequently transferred in the human brain through -methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), profusely expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) . GU, also modifies the characteristics of  proteins (occludin and claudin) at the site of BBB by depolarizing the enzyme, protein  phosphatase that manifests its usefulness for passive delivery of nanocarriers to the brain. GU, thus, represents itself as an ideal ligand for the surface decoration of nanocarriers to successfully administer them across the brain via receptor-mediated drug delivery pathway. Hence, we have employed here,  approaches to identify the potential GU-like molecules, as appropriate ligand(s) for surface engineering of nanoconstruct with the purpose of attaining targeted drug delivery to the brain. Structure-based virtual screening methods was used to filter PubChem database for the identification of bioactive compounds with >95% structure similarity with GU. We have further screened the compounds against NMDAR using molecular docking approach. Top hits were selected based on their high binding affinities and selectivity towards NMDAR, and their binding pattern was analysed in detail. Finally, all atom molecular dynamics simulation for 100 ns was carried out on free NMDAR and in-presence of the selected GU-like compound, gamma-l-glutamyl-l-cysteine to evaluate complex stability and structural dynamics. In conclusion, gamma-l-glutamyl-l-cysteine may act as potential binding partner of NMDAR which can further be evaluated in drug delivery system to brain across the BBB. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Jian) with graded levels of dietary choline (165-1820 mg/kg diet) for 65 days. The results firstly showed that choline deficiency induced inflammatory infiltration in the proximal intestine (PI), mid intestine (MI) and distal intestine (DI) of fish. Meanwhile, compared with the optimal choline group, choline deficiency decreased the activities of lysozyme and acid phosphatase, contents of complement 3 and IgM in the intestine, downregulated the mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides (liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide (LEAP) 2A and defensin-3 in the PI and MI, LEAP-2B and hepcidin in the PI, MI and DI), anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL) 10 and transforming growth factor β2 in the PI, MI and DI), and signaling molecule IκB in the PI, MI and DI; while upregulated the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6a and tumor necrosis factor α in the MI and DI, interferon γ2b in the PI and MI, IL-1β and IL-6b in the PI, MI and DI), and signaling molecules (Toll-like receptor 4 in the MI, myeloid differentiation primary response 88 in the PI and MI, Janus kinase 3 and  kinase 2 in the MI and DI, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 4 and STAT5 in the PI, MI and DI) of juvenile Jian carp, further indicating that choline deficiency caused inflammation and immunity depression in the intestine of fish. But choline deficiency decreased the PI IL-6a mRNA level, and increased the DI LEAP-2A and defensin-3 mRNA levels with unknown reasons. Furthermore, dietary choline deficiency downregulated mRNA levels of  (TJ) proteins (claudin 3c in the PI and MI, claudin 7, claudin 11 and occludin in the PI, MI and DI) and signaling molecule mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 in the PI, MI and DI of juvenile Jian carp, whereas upregulated the mRNA levels of claudin 3b in the MI and DI, and claudin 3c in the DI. Moreover, the excessive choline exhibited negative effects on intestinal immunity and TJ proteins that were similar to the choline deficiency. In summary, dietary choline deficiency or excess caused the depression of intestinal mucosal immune by inducing inflammation and dysfunction of the intestinal physical barrier, and regulating related signaling molecules of fish.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although protein  kinase 6 (PTK6, also known as breast tumor kinase BRK) has been primarily studied in an oncogenic context, it was noted that PTK6 null mice exhibited significantly enhanced colonic epithelial barrier function. Considering that the inflammatory functions of PTK6 have not yet been explored, we hypothesized that cytokines responsible for mediating IBD, such as TNFα/IFNγ, may solicit the action of PTK6 to alter barrier function. After first assessing critical mediators of TNFα/IFNγ driven epithelial barrier dysfunction, we further explored the possibility of PTK6 in this inflammatory context. In this report, we showed that PTK6 siRNA and PTK6 null young adult mouse colonic epithelial cells (YAMC) exhibited significant attenuation of TNFα/IFNγ induced barrier dysfunction as measured by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) assay and permeability assays. In addition, PTK6 null cells transfected with PTK6 cDNA displayed restored barrier dysfunction in response to TNFα/IFNγ, while the cells transfected with vector alone showed similar attenuation of barrier dysfunction. Furthermore, using subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry experiments, we found that PTK6 plays a role in FoxO1 nuclear accumulation leading to down-regulation of claudin-3, a  protein. Moreover, we searched for relevant miRNA candidates putative for targeting PTK6 in order to identify and assess the impact of microRNA that target PTK6 with respect to TNFα/IFNγ induced barrier dysfunction. Subsequently, we assayed likely targets and determined their effectiveness in attenuating PTK6 expression as well as cytokine induced barrier dysfunction. Results showed that miR-93 reduced PTK6 expression and attenuated TNFα/IFNγ imposed decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), as well as excluded FoxO1 from the nucleus. Our results indicate that PTK6 may act as a novel mediator of intestinal epithelial permeability during inflammatory injury, and miR-93 may protect intestinal epithelial barrier function, at least in part, by targeting PTK6.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20452446>Effect of metals on β-actin and total protein synthesis in cultured human intestinal epithelial cells.</a></h1><p>As an important structural protein, β-actin is associated with anchoring of  (TJs) to the cell scaffold. Caco-2 cells, an immortal intestinal epithelial cell line, rely on β-actin to form intact monolayers with high transepithelial electrical resistance in cell culture inserts.We examined the effect of six metals on expression of β-actin mRNA and β-actin synthesis, on total and net production of newly synthesized proteins, on paracellular transport of TJ markers, and on cell viability in confluent monolayers. [(3)H]-glycine and [(3)H]- were used as indicators of newly synthesized proteins in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, copper, manganese, mercury and nickel. The monolayers were exposed to 24-h single exposures as well as continuous daily repeated doses of metals for 48-h and 96-h.Results suggest that decreases in newly synthesized proteins, in which β-actin represents about 10%, correlated with 2- to 5-fold higher expression of β-actin mRNA for the higher concentrations of metals. Interestingly, IC(50)s calculated for each chemical for 24-h acute and 48- and 96-h repeated dosing experiments, using the MTT viability assay and paracellular permeability markers, decreased newly synthesized and total proteins to 10% and 40% of control, respectively.Overall, the results indicate that, at equivalent concentrations, the metals affect β-actin mRNA and newly synthesized proteins before cell viability and paracellular permeability are compromised. Consequently the results help in elucidating mechanisms of metal cytotoxicity that lead to understanding the relationship between  integrity, paracellular transport, and cell viability.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Although VEGF family members are potent promoters of endothelial permeability the role of placental growth factor (PlGF) is hotly debated. Here we investigated PlGF isoforms 1 and 2 and present in vitro and in vivo evidence that PlGF-1, but not PlGF-2, can inhibit VEGF-induced permeability but only during a critical window post-VEGF exposure. PlGF-1 promotes VE-cadherin expression via the trans-activating Sp1 and Sp3 interaction with the VE-cadherin promoter and subsequently stabilizes transendothelial , but only after activation of endothelial cells by VEGF. PlGF-1 regulates vascular permeability associated with the rapid localization of VE-cadherin to the plasma membrane and dephosphorylation of  residues that precedes changes observed in claudin 5  phosphorylation and membrane localization. The critical window during which PlGF-1 exerts its effect on VEGF-induced permeability highlights the importance of the translational significance of this work in that PLGF-1 likely serves as an endogenous anti-permeability factor whose effectiveness is limited to a precise time point following vascular injury. Clinical approaches that would pattern nature's approach would thus limit treatments to precise intervals following injury and bring attention to use of agents only during therapeutic windows.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23871805>Beneficial effects of (RS)-glucoraphanin on the  dysfunction in a mouse model of restraint stress.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this work is to evaluate the effects of (RS)-glucoraphanin, a glucosinolate present in Brassicaceae, notably in Tuscan black kale, and bioactivated with myrosinase enzyme (bioactive RS-GRA) (10mg/kg intraperitoneally), and to assess its capacity to prevent the dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a fundamental structure for brain homeostasis, in a mouse model of restraint stress.CD1 mice were subjected to restraint stress by blocking the body with a tape on a table for 150 min at the four extremities. After the sacrifice of the animals, stomachs and brains were collected to perform histological evaluation, Evan's blue dye, immunohistochemistry and western blotting analysis, to evaluate whether immobilization stress leads to alterations of  (TJ) components, such as claudin-1, claudin-3 and ZO-1.Immobilization causes considerable damage to BBB as shown by detection of Evan's blue dye, indicating a high level of extravasation due to stress. BBB alterations were accompanied by an enhancement of GFAP expression, IkB-alpha degradation followed by increased NF-kBp65 nuclear translocation, as well as caspase 3 overexpression. Conversely, our results revealed that bioactive RS-GRA treatment significantly counteracts the changes in all these parameters and preserves TJ integrity reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β, and increasing the production of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Additionally, bioactive RS-GRA shows antioxidant properties modulating iNOS and nitrotyrosine expression.Our results clearly show that bioactive RS-GRA could represent a possible treatment during pharmacological therapy of stress.© 2013.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28170408>TNFα alters occludin and cerebral endothelial permeability: Role of p38MAPK.</a></h1><p>Occludin is a key  (TJ) protein in cerebral endothelial cells (CECs) playing an important role in modulating blood-brain barrier (BBB) functions. This protein (65kDa) has been shown to engage in many signaling pathways and phosphorylation by both  and threonine kinases. Despite yet unknown mechanisms, pro-inflammatory cytokines and endotoxin (lipopolysaccharides, LPS) may alter TJ proteins in CECs and BBB functions. Here we demonstrate the responses of occludin in an immortalized human cerebral endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3) to stimulation by TNFα (10 ng/mL), IL-1β (10 ng/mL) and LPS (100 ng/mL). Exposing cells to TNFα resulted in a rapid and transient upward band-shift of occludin, suggesting of an increase in phosphorylation. Exposure to IL-1β produced significantly smaller effects and LPS produced almost no effects on occludin band-shift. TNFα also caused transient stimulation of p38MAPK and ERK1/2 in hCMEC/D3 cells, and the occludin band-shift induced by TNFα was suppressed by SB202190, an inhibitor for p38MAPK, and partly by U0126, the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 inhibitor. Cells treated with TNFα and IL-1β but not LPS for 24 h resulted in a significant (p < 0.001) decrease in the expression of occludin, and the decrease could be partially blocked by SB202190, the inhibitor for p38MAPK. Treatment with TNFα also altered cell morphology and enhanced permeability of the CEC layer as measured by the FITC-dextran assay and the trans-endothelial electrical resistances (TEER). However, treatment with SB202190 alone could not effectively reverse the TNFα -induced morphology changes or the enhanced permeability changes. These results suggest that despite effects of TNFα on p38MAPK-mediated occludin phosphorylation and expression, these changes are not sufficient to avert the TNFα-induced alterations on cell morphology and permeability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22685326>Eya1 protein phosphatase regulates  formation in lung distal epithelium.</a></h1><p>Little is known about the regulatory mechanisms underlying lung epithelial  (TJ) assembly, which is inextricably linked to the preservation of epithelial polarity, and is highly coordinated by proteins that regulate epithelial cell polarity, such as aPKCζ. We recently reported that Eya1 phosphatase functions through aPKCζ-Notch1 signaling to control cell polarity in the lung epithelium. Here, we have extended these observations to TJ formation to demonstrate that Eya1 is crucial for the maintenance of TJ protein assembly in the lung epithelium, probably by controlling aPKCζ phosphorylation levels, aPKCζ-mediated TJ protein phosphorylation and Notch1-Cdc42 activity. Thus, TJs are disassembled after interfering with Eya1 function in vivo or during calcium-induced TJ assembly in vitro. These effects are reversed by reintroduction of wild-type Eya1 or partially inhibiting aPKCζ in Eya1siRNA cells. Moreover, genetic activation of Notch1 rescues Eya1(-/-) lung epithelial TJ defects. These findings uncover novel functions for the Eya1-aPKCζ-Notch1-Cdc42 pathway as a crucial regulatory mechanism of TJ assembly and polarity of the lung epithelium, providing a conceptual framework for future mechanistic and translational studies in this area.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28906444>Short-Term Intake of a Fructose-, Fat- and Cholesterol-Rich Diet Causes Hepatic Steatosis in Mice: Effect of Antibiotic Treatment.</a></h1><p>Intestinal microbiota and barrier functions seem to play an important role in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, whether these changes are an early event in the development of NAFLD or are primarily associated with later stages of the disease, has not yet been clarified. Using a pair-feeding model, we determined the effects of a short-term intake of a fat-, fructose- and cholesterol-rich diet (FFC) on the development of early hepatic steatosis and markers of intestinal barrier function in mice treated with and without non-resorbable antibiotics (AB). For four days, C57BL/6J mice were either pair-fed a control diet or a FFC diet ± AB (92 mg/kg body weight (BW) polymyxin B and 216 mg/kg BW neomycin). Hepatic steatosis and markers of inflammation, lipidperoxidation and intestinal barrier function were assessed. Lipid accumulation and early signs of inflammation found in the livers of FFC-fed mice were markedly attenuated in FFC + AB-fed animals. In FFC-fed mice the development of NAFLD was associated with a significant loss of  proteins and an induction of matrix metalloproteinase-13 in the upper parts of the small intestine as well as significantly higher portal endotoxin levels and an induction of dependent signaling cascades in the liver. As expected, portal endotoxin levels and the expression of dependent signaling cascades in liver tissue were almost at the level of controls in FFC + AB-fed mice. However, FFC + AB-fed mice were also protected from the loss of zonula occludens-1 and partially of occludin protein in small intestine. Our data suggest that the development of early diet-induced hepatic steatosis in mice at least in part results from alterations of intestinal barrier function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075189>Ouabain Modulates the Adherens Junction in Renal Epithelial Cells.</a></h1><p>Ouabain, a well-known plant-derived toxin, is also a hormone found in mammals at nanomolar levels that binds to a site located in the a-subunit of Na⁺,K⁺-ATPase. Our main goal was to understand the physiological roles of ouabain. Previously, we found that ouabain increases the degree of tight junction sealing, GAP junction-mediated communication and ciliogenesis. Considering our previous results, we investigated the effect of ouabain on adherens junctions.We used immunofluorescence and immunoblot methods to measure the effect of 10 nM ouabain on the cellular and nuclear content of E-cadherin, β-catenin and γ-catenin in cultured monolayers of Marin Darby canine renal cells (MDCK). We also studied the effect of ouabain on adherens junction biogenesis through sequential Ca²⁺ removal and replenishment. Then, we investigated whether c-Src and ERK1/2 kinases are involved in these responses.Ouabain enhanced the cellular content of the adherens junction proteins E-cadherin, β-catenin and γ-catenin and displaced β-catenin and γ-catenin from the plasma membrane into the nucleus. Ouabain also increased the expression levels of E-cadherin and β-catenin in the plasma membrane after Ca²⁺ replenishment. These effects on adherens junctions were sensitive to PP2 and PD98059, suggesting that they depend on c-Src and ERK1/2 signaling. The translocation of β-catenin and γ-catenin into the nucleus was specific because ouabain did not change the localization of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and ZO-2. Moreover, in ouabain-resistant MDCK cells, which express a Na⁺,K⁺-ATPase α1-subunit with low affinity for ouabain, this hormone was unable to regulate adherens junctions, indicating that the ouabain receptor that regulates adherens junctions is Na⁺,K⁺-ATPase.Ouabain (10 nM) upregulated adherens junctions. This novel result supports the proposition that one of the physiological roles of this hormone is the modulation of cell contacts.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Disrupting the BTB is therefore highly desirable but complicated by the need to maintain the normal blood-brain barrier (BBB). Here we show that targeting glioma stem cell (GSC)-derived pericytes specifically disrupts the BTB and enhances drug effusion into brain tumors. We found that pericyte coverage of tumor vasculature is inversely correlated with GBM patient survival after chemotherapy. Eliminating GSC-derived pericytes in xenograft models disrupted BTB  and increased vascular permeability. We identified BMX as an essential factor for maintaining GSC-derived pericytes. Inhibiting BMX with ibrutinib selectively targeted neoplastic pericytes and disrupted the BTB, but not the BBB, thereby increasing drug effusion into established tumors and enhancing the chemotherapeutic efficacy of drugs with poor BTB penetration. These findings highlight the clinical potential of targeting neoplastic pericytes to significantly improve treatment of brain tumors.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A critical function of the intestinal epithelium is formation of a selective barrier to luminal contents. The structural units of the epithelium that regulate barrier function are the  (TJs), and the protein composition of the TJ determines the tightness of the barrier. Claudin-2 is a TJ protein that increases permeability to cations and reduces transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). We previously showed that transient knockdown (KD) of TCPTP permits increased expression of claudin-2 by IFN-γ. Here, we demonstrate that the decreased TER in TCPTP-deficient epithelial cells is alleviated by STAT1 KD. Moreover, increased claudin-2 in TCPTP-deficient cells requires enhanced STAT1 activation and STAT1 binding to the CLDN2 promoter. We also show that mutation of this STAT-binding site prevents elevated CLDN2 promoter activity in TCPTP-deficient epithelial cells. In summary, we demonstrate that TCPTP protects the intestinal epithelial barrier by restricting STAT-induced claudin-2 expression. This is a potential mechanism by which loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding TCPTP may contribute to barrier defects in chronic intestinal inflammatory disease.© 2017 New York Academy of Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574128>Pyk2-dependent phosphorylation of LSR enhances localization of LSR and tricellulin at tricellular .</a></h1><p> (TJs) are cellular  within the mammalian epithelial cell sheet that function as a physical barrier to molecular transport within the intercellular space. Dysregulation of TJs leads to various diseases. Tricellular TJs (tTJs), specialized structural variants of TJs, are formed by multiple transmembrane proteins (e.g., lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor [LSR] and tricellulin) within tricellular contacts in the mammalian epithelial cell sheet. However, the mechanism for recruiting LSR and tricellulin to tTJs is largely unknown. Previous studies have identified that tyrphostin 9, the dual inhibitor of Pyk2 (a nonreceptor  kinase) and receptor  kinase platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), suppresses LSR and tricellulin recruitment to tTJs in EpH4 (a mouse mammary epithelial cell line) cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of Pyk2 inhibition on LSR and tricellulin localization to tTJs. Pyk2 inactivation by its specific inhibitor or repression by RNAi inhibited the localization of LSR and downstream tricellulin to tTJs without changing their expression level in EpH4 cells. Pyk2-dependent changes in subcellular LSR and tricellulin localization were independent of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and expression. Additionally, Pyk2-dependent LSR phosphorylation at Tyr-237 was required for LSR and tricellulin localization to tTJs and decreased epithelial barrier function. Our findings indicated a novel mechanism by which Pyk2 regulates tTJ assembly and epithelial barrier function in the mammalian epithelial cell sheet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30219077>Increased expression of claudin-17 promotes a malignant phenotype in hepatocyte via Tyk2/Stat3 signaling and is associated with poor prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in Asia; however, the molecular mechanism in its tumorigenesis remains unclear. Abnormal expression of claudins (CLDNs), a family of tight junction (TJ) proteins, plays an important role in the metastatic phenotype of epithelial-derived tumors by affecting tight junction structure, function and related cellular signaling pathways. In a previous study, we used a tissue chip assay to identify CLDN17 as an upregulated gene in HCC. Here we aimed to use molecular biology technology to explore the effect of CLDN17 on the malignant phenotype of HCC and the underlying molecular mechanism, with the objective of identifying a new target for HCC treatment and the control of HCC metastasis.The expression levels of CLDN17 in HCC tissues and histologically non-neoplastic hepatic tissues were explored by immunohistochemistry. Stable transfection of the hepatocyte line HL7702 with CLDN17 was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blotting and immunofluorescence. The impact of CLDN17 on the malignant phenotype of HL7702 cells in vitro was assessed by a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay, a Transwell assay and a wound-healing experiment. Western blotting was utilized to detect the activation state of  kinase 2 (Tyk2) / signal transducer and activator of transcription3 (Stat3) pathway. A Tyk2 RNA interference (RNAi) was utilized to determine the impact of the Tyk2/Stat3 signaling pathway on the malignant phenotype of hepatocytes.In this work, our research group first found that CLDN17 was highly expressed in HCC tissues and was associated with poor prognosis. In addition, we demonstrated that CLDN17 affected the Stat3 signaling pathway via Tyk2 and ultimately enhanced the migration ability of hepatocytes.In conclusion, we confirmed that the upregulated expression of CLDN17 significantly enhances the migration ability of hepatocytes in vitro and we found that the activation of the Stat3 pathway by Tyk2 may an important mechanism by which CLDN17 promotes aggressiveness in hepatocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25851441> disruption by cadmium in an in vitro human airway tissue model.</a></h1><p>The cadmium (Cd) present in air pollutants and cigarette smoke has the potential of causing multiple adverse health outcomes involving damage to pulmonary and cardiovascular tissue. Injury to pulmonary epithelium may include alterations in  (TJ) integrity, resulting in impaired epithelial barrier function and enhanced penetration of chemicals and biomolecules. Herein, we investigated mechanisms involved in the disruption of TJ integrity by Cd exposure using an in vitro human air-liquid-interface (ALI) airway tissue model derived from normal primary human bronchial epithelial cells.ALI cultures were exposed to noncytotoxic doses of CdCl2 basolaterally and TJ integrity was measured by Trans-Epithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) and immunofluorescence staining with TJ markers. PCR array analysis was used to identify genes involved with TJ collapse. To explore the involvement of kinase signaling pathways, cultures were treated with CdCl2 in the presence of kinase inhibitors specific for cellular Src or Protein Kinase C (PKC).Noncytotoxic doses of CdCl2 resulted in the collapse of barrier function, as demonstrated by TEER measurements and Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin staining. CdCl2 exposure altered the expression of several groups of genes encoding proteins involved in TJ homeostasis. In particular, down-regulation of select -interacting proteins suggested that a possible mechanism for Cd toxicity involves disruption of the peripheral junctional complexes implicated in connecting membrane-bound TJ components to the actin cytoskeleton. Inhibition of kinase signaling using inhibitors specific for cellular Src or PKC preserved the integrity of TJs, possibly by preventing occludin  hyperphosphorylation, rather than reversing the down-regulation of the -interacting proteins.Our findings indicate that acute doses of Cd likely disrupt TJ integrity in human ALI airway cultures both through occludin hyperphosphorylation via kinase activation and by direct disruption of the -interacting complex.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25556764>12/15-Lipoxygenase-dependent ROS production is required for diet-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction.</a></h1><p>To understand the mechanisms of 15(S)-HETE-induced endothelial cell (EC) barrier dysfunction, we examined the role of xanthine oxidase (XO). 15(S)-HETE induced  adhesion molecule A (JamA) phosphorylation on Y164, Y218, and Y280 involving XO-mediated reactive oxygen species production and Src and Pyk2 activation, resulting in its dissociation from occludin, thereby causing  (TJ) disruption, increased vascular permeability, and enhanced leukocyte and monocyte transmigration in vitro using EC monolayer and ex vivo using arteries as models. The phosphorylation of JamA on Y164, Y218, and Y280 appears to be critical for its role in 15(S)-HETE-induced EC barrier dysfunction, as mutation of any one of these amino acid residues prevented its dissociation from occludin and restored TJ integrity and barrier function. In response to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, WT, but not 12/15-lipoxygenase (LO)(-/-), mice showed enhanced XO expression and its activity in the artery, which was correlated with increased aortic TJ disruption and barrier permeability with enhanced leukocyte adhesion and these responses were inhibited by allopurinol.

In quiescent pulmonary epithelial cells, HER2 and β-catenin colocalized along the lateral intercellular . HER2 activation by the ligand neuregulin-1 was associated with  phosphorylation of β-catenin, dissociation of β-catenin from E-cadherin, and decreased E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. All effects were blocked with the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib. β-Catenin knockdown using shRNA significantly attenuated neuregulin-1-induced decreases in pulmonary epithelial resistance in vitro.

On the basis of this observation, we suggested that ouabain might also modulate cell contacts at low, nontoxic levels (10 or 50 nM). To test this possibility, we analyzed its effect on a particular type of cell-cell contact: the  (TJ). We demonstrate that at concentrations that neither inhibit K(+) pumping nor disturb the K(+) balance of the cell, ouabain modulates the degree of sealing of the TJ as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and the flux of neutral 3 kDa dextran (J(DEX)). This modulation is accompanied by changes in the levels and distribution patterns of claudins 1, 2, and 4. Interestingly, changes in TER, J(DEX), and claudins behavior are mediated through signal pathways containing ERK1/2 and c-Src, which have distinct effects on each physiological parameter and claudin type.

One of the key determinants in HGF-driven morphological changes is the actomyosin cytoskeleton whose organization and physical parameters changes upon stimulation. Here we have investigated how HGF affects the different actomyosin-associated cell-cell  complexes, Nectin , Adherens  and  in MDCK cells. We find that components of all complexes stay present at cell-cell contacts until their physical dissociation. We find that at cell-cell , the mobility of Claudin-3, but not that of other cell-cell adhesion receptors, is affected by HGF. This depends on  residues that likely affect PDZ-domain interactions at the C-terminal tail of Claudin-3, although their phosphorylation is not directly regulated by HGF. Thus we uncovered Claudins as novel targets of HGF signaling at cell-cell .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23593167>Focused examination of the intestinal epithelium reveals transcriptional signatures consistent with disturbances in enterocyte maturation and differentiation during the course of SIV infection.</a></h1><p>The Gastrointestinal (GI) tract plays a pivotal role in AIDS pathogenesis as it is the primary site for viral transmission, replication and CD4(+) T cell destruction. Accordingly, GI disease (enteropathy) has become a well-known complication and a driver of AIDS progression. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying GI disease we analyzed global gene expression profiles sequentially in the intestinal epithelium of the same animals before SIV infection and at 21 and 90 days post infection (DPI). More importantly we obtained sequential excisional intestinal biopsies and examined distinct mucosal components (epithelium. intraepithelial lymphocytes, lamina propria lymphocytes, fibrovascular stroma) separately. Here we report data pertaining to the epithelium. Overall genes associated with epithelial cell renewal/proliferation/differentiation, permeability and adhesion were significantly down regulated (<1.5-7 fold) at 21 and 90DPI. Genes regulating focal adhesions (n = 6), gap  (n = 3), ErbB (n = 3) and Wnt signaling (n = 4) were markedly down at 21DPI and the number of genes in each of these groups that were down regulated doubled between 21 and 90DPI. Notable genes included FAK, ITGA6, PDGF, TGFβ3, Ezrin, FZD6, WNT10A, and TCF7L2. In addition, at 90DPI genes regulating ECM-receptor interactions (laminins and ITGB1), epithelial cell gene expression (PDX1, KLF6), polarity/ formation (PARD3B&6B) and histone demethylase (JMJD3) were also down regulated. In contrast, expression of NOTCH3, notch target genes (HES4, HES7) and EZH2 (histone methyltransferase) were significantly increased at 90DPI. The altered expression of genes linked to Wnt signaling together with decreased expression of PDX1, PARD3B, PARD6B and SDK1 suggests marked perturbations in intestinal epithelial function and homeostasis leading to breakdown of the mucosal barrier. More importantly, the divergent expression patterns of EZH2 and JMJD3 suggests that an epigenetic mechanism involving histone modifications may contribute to the massive decrease in gene expression at 90DPI leading to defects in enterocyte maturation and differentiation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31099453>Dysregulation of focal adhesion kinase upon Toxoplasma gondii infection facilitates parasite translocation across polarised primary brain endothelial cell monolayers.</a></h1><p>The apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii invades tissues and traverses non-permissive biological barriers in infected humans and other vertebrates. Following ingestion, the parasite penetrates the intestinal wall and disseminates to immune-privileged sites such as the brain parenchyma, after crossing the blood-brain . In the present study, we have established a protocol for high-purification of primary mouse brain endothelial cells to generate stably polarised monolayers that allowed assessment of cellular  traversal by T. gondii. We report that T. gondii tachyzoites translocate across polarised monolayers of mouse brain endothelial cells and human intestinal Caco2 cells without significantly perturbing  impermeability and with minimal change in transcellular electrical resistance. In contrast, challenge with parasite lysate or LPS increased  permeability by destabilising intercellular tight junctions (TJs) and accentuated transmigration of T. gondii. Conversely, reduced phosphorylation of the TJ-regulator focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was observed dose-dependently upon challenge of monolayers with live T. gondii but not with parasite lysate or LPS. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK phosphorylation reversibly altered   and facilitated T. gondii translocation. Finally, gene silencing of FAK by shRNA facilitated transmigration of T. gondii across epithelial and endothelial monolayers. Jointly, the data demonstrate that T. gondii infection transiently alters the TJ stability through FAK dysregulation to facilitate transmigration. This work identifies the implication of the TJ regulator FAK in the transmigration of T. gondii across polarised cellular monolayers and provides novel insights in how microbes overcome the restrictiveness of biological barriers.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28082110>Novel phototoxicity assay using human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells.</a></h1><p>Some chemicals are harmful in to light-exposed tissues such as skin and eyes. The 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Test has been validated and adopted by the Organization of Economic and Community Development (OECD) as a method of evaluating chemical phototoxicity using mouse 3T3 fibroblasts. However, the high rate of false positive results associated with this test eventually led to increased laboratory animal usage. Although the eye is vulnerable to light damage because of constant exposure to environmental radiation, few approaches are available to predict ocular phototoxicity in humans. Here, we propose a tier one test that identifies the potential ocular phototoxicity of chemical substances. Using a three-dimensional culture technique, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were differentiated to retinal pigment epithelial cell (RPE) precursors. The precursors after prolonged treatment with FBS formed a uniform hexagonal lattice of cells with well-developed  and time-dependent elevation of melanin content and RPE maturation marker levels. Hierarchical clustering of gene transcripts revealed that hESC-derived RPEs were very similar to tissue-derived adult RPEs. Interestingly, there were a high percentage of chemicals eliciting a positive response in 3T3 cells and negative in hESC-derived RPEs under the experimental conditions used in the phototoxicity test. The response to treatment of hESC-derived RPEs with these negative chemicals became positive at a higher dose of UVA irradiation; however, the biological responses to these chemicals differed between the two cells. Taken together, we conclude that hESC-derived RPEs are novel tool for future toxicological and mechanistic studies of ocular phototoxicity in humans.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the early gonadal development remains poorly understood. Mice lacking the paired-like homeobox gene Emx2 display gonadal dysgenesis. Interestingly, the knockout (KO) embryonic gonads develop an unusual surface accompanied by aberrant  assembly. Morphological and in vitro cell fate mapping studies showed an apparent decrease in the number of the gonadal epithelial cells migrated to mesenchymal compartment in the KO, suggesting that polarized cell division and subsequent cell migration are affected. Microarray analyses of the epithelial cells revealed significant up-regulation of Egfr in the KO, indicating that Emx2 suppresses Egfr gene expression. This genetic correlation between the two genes was reproduced with cultured M15 cells derived from mesonephric epithelial cells. Epidermal growth factor receptor signaling was recently shown to regulate  assembly through sarcoma viral oncogene homolog  phosphorylation. We show through Emx2 KO analyses that sarcoma viral oncogene homolog  phosphorylation, epidermal growth factor receptor  phosphorylation, and Egfr expression are up-regulated in the embryonic gonad. Our results strongly suggest that Emx2 is required for regulation of  assembly and allowing migration of the gonadal epithelia to the mesenchyme, which are possibly mediated by suppression of Egfr expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26991136>β-asarone and levodopa co-administration increase striatal dopamine level in 6-hydroxydopamine induced rats by modulating P-glycoprotein and  proteins at the blood-brain barrier and promoting levodopa into the brain.</a></h1><p>Levodopa (L-dopa) is widely considered as one of the most effective drug constituents in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of L-dopa is <5%, which causes low efficacy. Neuroprotective effects of β-asarone on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rats were demonstrated by our previous studies. Co-administration of β-asarone and L-dopa has not been explored until being investigated on PD rats in this study. PD rats were divided into four groups: untreated, L-dopa-treated, β-asarone-treated and co-administered-treated groups. All of the treatments were administered to the rats twice per day for 30 days. The L-dopa, dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), S100β and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels were subsequently determined. The P-glycoprotein (P-gp), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), claudin-5, occludin and actin expression was also assessed in cortex. Changes in BBB ultrastructure were observed using transmission electron microscopy. Our results showed that the co-administered treatment increased levels of L-dopa, DA, DOPAC and HVA in striatum, and S100β in plasma, but down-regulated NSE, P-gp, ZO-1, occludin, actin and claudin-5 in cortex. Crevices were observed between capillary endothelial cells at intercellular  of the striatum in co-administered-treated group, while the endothelial cells in untreated group were tightly jointing each other. In addition, the correlations of L-dopa or DA and P-gp or  proteins respectively were significantly negative in co-administered- and β-asarone-treated groups. These findings suggest that co-administered treatment may enhance the L-dopa BBB permeability and attenuate brain injury, which may be beneficial to PD treatment.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27815408>EphA2 proteomics in human keratinocytes reveals a novel association with afadin and epidermal .</a></h1><p>EphA2 is a receptor  kinase that helps to maintain epidermal tissue homeostasis. A proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) approach was used to identify proteins in close proximity to EphA2 within primary human keratinocytes and three-dimensional (3D) reconstituted human epidermis (RHE) cultures to map a putative protein interaction network for this membrane receptor that exhibits a polarized distribution in stratified epithelia. Although a subset of known EphA2 interactors were identified in the BioID screen, >97% were uniquely detected in keratinocytes with over 50% of these vicinal proteins only present in 3D human epidermal culture. Afadin (AFDN), a cytoskeletal and -associated protein, was present in 2D and 3D keratinocyte cultures, and validated as a so-far-unknown EphA2-interacting protein. Loss of EphA2 protein disrupted the subcellular distribution of afadin and occludin in differentiated keratinocytes, leading to impairment of .

Whether oxidative stress actually causes diabetic retinopathy via the generation of toxic eicosanoids, however, remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to determine whether  nitration of prostacyclin synthase (PGIS) contributes to retinal cell death in vitro and in vivo. Exposure of human retinal pericytes to heavily oxidized and glycated LDL (HOG-LDL), but not native forms of LDL (N-LDL), for 24 hours significantly increased pericyte apoptosis, accompanied by increased  nitration of PGIS and decreased PGIS activity. Inhibition of the thromboxane receptor or cyclooxygenase-2 dramatically attenuated HOG-LDL-induced apoptosis without restoring PGIS activity. Administration of superoxide dismutase (to scavenge superoxide anions) or L-N(G)-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME, a nonselective nitric oxide synthase inhibitor) restored PGIS activity and attenuated pericyte apoptosis. In Akita mouse retinas, diabetes increased intraretinal levels of oxidized LDL and glycated LDL, induced PGIS nitration, enhanced apoptotic cell death, and impaired blood-retinal barrier function. Chronic administration of tempol, a superoxide scavenger, reduced intraretinal oxidized LDL and glycated LDL levels, PGIS nitration, and retina cell apoptosis, thereby preserving the integrity of blood-retinal barriers. In conclusion, oxidized LDL-mediated PGIS nitration and associated thromboxane receptor stimulation might be important in the initiation and progression of diabetic retinopathy.Copyright © 2011 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

It is becoming increasingly clear that estradiol (E2) induces breast cancer cell progression and enhances EMT; however, the mechanisms associated with this are unclear. We investigated the role of E2 on the expression and intracellular localization of the  (TJ)-associated proteins, zonula occluden 1 (ZO-1), ZO-1-associated nucleic acid binding (ZONAB), and occludin, on the activation of c-Src and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression and cellular migration in the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and T47D. We demonstrated that 1 nM E2 elicits c-Src activation after 15 min. The p-Src/ZO-1 complex led to ZO-1 and ZONAB disruption at the TJ and increased expression of HER2 mRNAs. These changes correlate with decreased expression of the epithelial markers occludin and CRB3 and increased synthesis of N-cadherin. This led to increased MCF-7 cell migration induced by E2, even in the presence of a cell proliferation inhibitor. Incubation with ICI 182,780 (Fulvestrant), an ER antagonist, precluded the effects of E2 on c-Src phosphorylation, p-Src/ZO-1 complex formation, ZO-1/ZONAB nuclear translocation, and migration of MCF-7 cells. Our findings suggest that E2 promotes TJ disruption during tumor progression and increases cell motility.

Cytokines and chemokines regulate expression and the activation state of adhesion molecules that enable leukocytes to adhere and arrest at sites of leukocyte exit. Capturing and arrest is followed by the transmigration of leukocytes through the vessel wall-a process called diapedesis. The review will focus on recently published novel approaches to determine the route that leukocytes take in vivo when they migrate through the endothelial layer of blood vessels. This work has revealed the dominant importance of the junctional pathway between endothelial cells in vivo. In addition, recent progress has improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate junctional stability, the opening of endothelial  during leukocyte extravasation, and the induction of vascular permeability.© 2012 New York Academy of Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25377781>Calcium/Ask1/MKK7/JNK2/c-Src signalling cascade mediates disruption of intestinal epithelial  by dextran sulfate sodium.</a></h1><p>Disruption of intestinal epithelial  is an important event in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induces colitis in mice with symptoms similar to ulcerative colitis. However, the mechanism of DSS-induced colitis is unknown. We investigated the mechanism of DSS-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial  and barrier dysfunction in Caco-2 cell monolayers in vitro and mouse colon in vivo. DSS treatment resulted in disruption of , adherens  and actin cytoskeleton leading to barrier dysfunction in Caco-2 cell monolayers. DSS induced a rapid activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the inhibition or knockdown of JNK2 attenuated DSS-induced  disruption and barrier dysfunction. In mice, DSS administration for 4 days caused redistribution of  and adherens  proteins from the epithelial , which was blocked by JNK inhibitor. In Caco-2 cell monolayers, DSS increased intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, and depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) by 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA/AM) or thapsigargin attenuated DSS-induced JNK activation,  disruption and barrier dysfunction. Knockdown of apoptosis signal-regulated kinase 1 (Ask1) or MKK7 blocked DSS-induced  disruption and barrier dysfunction. DSS activated c-Src by a Ca2+ and JNK-dependent mechanism. Inhibition of Src kinase activity or knockdown of c-Src blocked DSS-induced  disruption and barrier dysfunction. DSS increased  phosphorylation of occludin, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), E-cadherin and β-catenin. SP600125 abrogated DSS-induced  phosphorylation of junctional proteins.

Sorting motifs of this type are known to route surface receptors into clathrin-mediated endocytosis through interaction with the medium subunit (μ2) of the clathrin adaptor AP-2, but how they guide new and recycling membrane proteins basolaterally is unknown. Here, we show that YNQV functions as a canonical YxxΦ motif, with both Y318 and V321 required for the correct basolateral localization and biosynthetic sorting of CAR, and for interaction with a highly conserved pocket in the medium subunits (μ1A and μ1B) of the clathrin adaptors AP-1A and AP-1B. Knock-down experiments demonstrate that AP-1A plays a role in the biosynthetic sorting of CAR, complementary to the role of AP-1B in basolateral recycling of this receptor.

These regions exist as caveolae, morphologically observable flask-like invaginations, or as a less easily detectable planar form. MLR are scaffolds for many molecular entities, including signaling receptors and ion channels that communicate extracellular stimuli to the intracellular milieu. Much evidence indicates that this organization and/or the clustering of MLR into more active signaling platforms depends upon interactions with and dynamic rearrangement of the cytoskeleton. Several cytoskeletal components and binding partners, as well as enzymes that regulate the cytoskeleton, localize to MLR and help regulate lateral diffusion of membrane proteins and lipids in response to extracellular events (e.g., receptor activation, shear stress, electrical conductance, and nutrient demand). MLR regulate cellular polarity, adherence to the extracellular matrix, signaling events (including ones that affect growth and migration), and are sites of cellular entry of certain pathogens, toxins and nanoparticles. The dynamic interaction between MLR and the underlying cytoskeleton thus regulates many facets of the function of eukaryotic cells and their adaptation to changing environments. Here, we review general features of MLR and caveolae and their role in several aspects of cellular function, including polarity of endothelial and epithelial cells, cell migration, mechanotransduction, lymphocyte activation, neuronal growth and signaling, and a variety of disease settings.

TBI can result in increased intestinal permeability resulting from apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells, which contain a large number of mitochondria for persisting barrier function. Autophagy of damaged mitochondria (mitophagy) controls the quality of the mitochondria and regulates cellular homeostasis. However, the exact mechanism of mitophagy that underlies the pathological changes induced by TBI is unknown. Here, we report that mitophagy decreases the intestinal epithelial cell damage and apoptosis that are activated in a rat model of controlled cortical impact (CCI). CCI-induced mitophagy is associated with an increase in 3-nitrotyrosine and 4-hydroxynonenal, indicating that oxidative stress may increase in response to mitochondrial disturbance. CCI also results in the expression of the  proteins zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin, which may regulate the in vivo intestinal hyperpermeability induced by CCI. Additionally, CCI-induced mitophagy was shown to be mediated by the oxidative stress-related extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/nuclear factor-erythroid2-like2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signaling pathway, which may serve to reduce the apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. These results suggest that CCI-induced mitophagy serves to diminish apoptosis-mediated intestinal epithelial cell damage and to improve intestinal permeability, via ERK/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. These findings may be useful in the design of rational approaches for the prevention and treatment of symptoms associated with TBI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22558212>YAP1 recruits c-Abl to protect angiomotin-like 1 from Nedd4-mediated degradation.</a></h1><p>Tissue development and organ growth require constant remodeling of cell-cell contacts formed between epithelial cells.

Aberrant signaling at cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion sites often involves downstream mediators including Rho GTPases and  kinases. This review discusses these molecules as putative mediators of cellular crosstalk between cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion sites, in addition to their attractiveness as therapeutic targets in cancer. Interestingly, inter-junctional crosstalk mechanisms are frequently typified by the way in which bacterial and viral pathogens opportunistically infect or intoxicate mammalian cells. This review therefore also discusses the concept of learning from pathogen-host interaction studies to better understand coordinated communication between cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion sites, in addition to highlighting the potential therapeutic usefulness of exploiting pathogens or their products to tap into inter-junctional crosstalk. Taken together, we feel that increased knowledge around mechanisms of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion site crosstalk and consequently a greater understanding of their therapeutic targeting offers a unique opportunity to contribute to the emerging molecular revolution in cancer biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29723998>The EBV-Encoded Oncoprotein, LMP1, Induces an Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) via Its CTAR1 Domain through Integrin-Mediated ERK-MAPK Signalling.</a></h1><p>The Epstein⁻Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) oncogene can induce profound effects on epithelial growth and differentiation including many of the features of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). To better characterise these effects, we used the well-defined Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cell model and found that LMP1 expression in these cells induces EMT as defined by characteristic morphological changes accompanied by loss of E-cadherin, desmosomal cadherin and  protein expression. The induction of the EMT phenotype required a functional CTAR1 domain of LMP1 and studies using pharmacological inhibitors revealed contributions from signalling pathways commonly induced by integrin⁻ligand interactions: extracellular signal-regulated kinases/mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK-MAPK), PI3-Kinase and  kinases, but not transforming growth factor beta (TGF&beta;). More detailed analysis implicated the CTAR1-mediated induction of Slug and Twist in LMP1-induced EMT. A key role for &beta;1 integrin signalling in LMP1-mediated ERK-MAPK and focal adhesion kianse (FAK) phosphorylation was observed, and &beta;1 integrin activation was found to enhance LMP1-induced cell viability and survival.

However, we previously demonstrated that activation of endogenous SFKs by expression of dominant negative C-terminal Src Kinase (DN-Csk) is not sufficient to decrease endothelial adherens  integrity. Basal SFK activity has been observed in normal venular endothelia and was not associated with increased basal permeability. The basal SFK activity however was found to contribute to increased sensitivity of the venular endothelium to inflammatory mediator-induced leakage. How SFK activation achieves this is still not well understood. Here, we show that SFK activation renders human dermal microvascular endothelial cells susceptible to low doses of TNF-α. Treatment of DN-Csk-expressing cells with 50 pg/ml TNF-α induced a loss of TEER as well as drastic changes in the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion proteins. This synergistic effect was independent of ROCK or NF-κB activity. TNF-α-induced p38 signaling was required for the synergistic effect on barrier function, and activation of the p38 MAPK alone was also able to induce changes in permeability only in monolayers with active SFKs. These results suggest that the activation of endogenous levels of SFK renders the endothelial barrier more susceptible to low, physiologic doses of TNF-α through activation of p38 which leads to a loss of endothelial .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23325809>The  phosphatase SHP2 regulates Sertoli cell  complexes.</a></h1><p>The blood-testis barrier (BTB) is a large junctional complex composed of , adherens , and gap  between adjacent Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules of the testis.

The effect of ultraviolet B (UVB) on normal skin was extensively studied; however, its effect on  perturbed skin remains undefined. Both  perturbation and UVB irradiation induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) in keratinocytes. Mild ER stress activates homeostatic UPR, while severe ER stress leads to abnormal UPR, promoting apoptosis and inflammation. Here, we investigated UV sensitivity and UVB-induced UPR in -disrupted human skin and the effects of pseudoceramide-dominant emollient on UVB-induced skin responses. Tape-stripped skin of healthy volunteers showed enhanced susceptibility to erythema and augmented proinflammatory cytokines induction following suberythemal UVB irradiation. Suberythemal UVB activated XBP1 in normal skin, while increased CHOP transcription in  perturbed skin. After tape stripping, pseudoceramide-dominant emollient was applied for 3 days, and then, the areas were irradiated with suberythemal UVB. Pretreatment with topical pseudoceramide protected against UVB-induced upregulation of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α transcription and reduced susceptibility to erythema following UVB. Topical pseudoceramide also suppressed suberythemal UVB-induced CHOP transcription in -disrupted skin. Taken together, these data indicate that permeability  disruption increases UV sensitivity in human skin, partly via switch the UVB-induced UPR, from homeostatic signals to pro-apoptotic and proinflammatory signals. In addition, we conclude that pseudoceramide-dominant emollient suppresses excessive ER stress induction and CHOP activation following UVB in  damaged skin, providing evidence that pseudoceramide-dominant emollients can be promising strategies for photoprotection of the  damaged skin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21726568>Inactivation of EphA2 promotes  formation and impairs angiogenesis in brain endothelial cells.</a></h1><p>Eph receptor  kinases and ephrin ligands participate in the regulation of a wide variety of biological processes, such as axon guidance, synaptic plasticity, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis. The role of Eph receptors and ephrin ligands in brain endothelial cells remains unknown. Here, we examined the expression profile of EphA receptors and ephrin-A ligands in human brain microvascular endothelial cell line (HBMEC). Our results showed that multiple EphA receptors and ephrin-A ligands are expressed in HBMEC.

Meanwhile, elevated EphA2 phosphorylation was accompanied by disassembly of  in HBMEC. Furthermore, EphA2 RNAi in HBMEC could promote  formation and prevent the ephrin-A1-induced  disruption. Also, when a kinase-inactive mutant of EphA2 (EphA2-K646M) was expressed in HBMEC, the  was enhanced and the ephrin-A1-induced  disruption was blocked. In addition, EphA2 RNAi and expression of EphA2-K646M in HBMEC inhibited in vitro cell migration and angiogenesis of HBMEC. These data indicated an important role of EphA2 in regulating both  formation and angiogenesis in brain endothelial cells.Crown Copyright © 2011. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The type IV bundle-forming pili (BFP) of typical EPEC strains are dynamic fibrillar organelles that can extend out and retract into the bacterium. The bfpF gene encodes for BfpF, a protein that promotes pili retraction. The BFP are involved in bacterial autoaggregation and in mediating the initial adherence of the bacterium with its host cell. Importantly, BFP retraction is implicated in virulence in experimental human infection. How pili retraction contributes to EPEC pathogenesis at the cellular level remains largely obscure, however. In this study, an effort has been made to address this question using engineered EPEC strains with induced BFP retraction capacity. We show that the retraction is important for  disruption and, to a lesser extent, actin-rich pedestal formation by promoting efficient translocation of bacterial protein effectors into the host cells. A model is proposed whereby BFP retraction permits closer apposition between the bacterial and the host cell surfaces, thus enabling timely and effective introduction of bacterial effectors into the host cell via the type III secretion apparatus. Our studies hence suggest novel insights into the involvement of pili retraction in EPEC pathogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30483759>EphA3 inhibits migration and invasion of esophageal cancer cells by activating the mesenchymal‑epithelial transition process.</a></h1><p>Eph receptor  kinases are critical for cell‑cell communication during normal and oncogenic development. Eph receptor A3 (EphA3) expression is associated with tumor promotion in certain types of cancer; however, it acts as a tumor suppressor in others. The expression levels of EphA3 and its effects on tumor progression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines were determined using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and a Transwell invasion assay. The present study demonstrated that EphA3 expression was decreased in ESCC tissues and cell lines. Treatment with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5‑aza‑2'‑deoxycytidine increased the mRNA expression levels of EphA3 in the ESCC cell lines KYSE510 and KYSE30. In addition, overexpression of EphA3 in KYSE450 and KYSE510 cells inhibited cell migration and invasion. EphA3 overexpression also decreased RhoA GTPase. Furthermore, EphA3 overexpression induced mesenchymal‑epithelial transition, as demonstrated by epithelial‑like morphological alterations, increased expression of epithelial proteins (E‑cadherin and the  protein 1 zonula occludens‑1) and decreased expression of mesenchymal proteins (Vimentin, N‑cadherin and Snail). Conversely, silencing EphA3 in KYSE410 cells triggered epithelial‑mesenchymal transition, and promoted cell migration and invasion. These results suggested that EphA3 may serve a tumor‑suppressor role in ESCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30173891>Role of Csk in intestinal epithelial  function and protection against colitis.</a></h1><p>Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) play a pivotal role in the maintenance of the  and  function of the intestinal epithelium. Dysfunctions of IECs are thought to participate in the disruption of the intestinal epithelial , resulting in gastrointestinal diseases, such as colitis and colorectal cancer. Here we show that IEC-specific COOH-terminal Src kinase (Csk)-deficient mice (Csk CKO mice) manifested the increased susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, a model of inflammatory bowel disease. DSS-treated Csk CKO mice also exhibited the significantly elevated intestinal permeability. Following DSS treatment, Csk CKO mice exhibited the higher proliferative activity of colonic epithelial cells and the increased number of apoptotic cells in the colon compared with that apparent for control mice. Moreover, the abundance of the tight junction protein occludin, which regulates cell-cell adhesion as well as epithelial permeability, was markedly reduced in the colon of DSS-treated Csk CKO mice. These results thus suggest that Csk in IECs plays important roles in the regulation of the intestinal epithelial  function and protection against colitis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we maintained human Sertoli cells in a mitotically active state in vitro, thus enabling transfection experiments that altered gene expression to explore the molecular mechanism(s) underlying toxicant-induced cell injury. Human Sertoli cells obtained from men at ages 15, 23, 36 and 40 were cultured in vitro. These differentiated Sertoli cells remained mitotically active when cultured in the presence of 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum), with a replication time of ~1-3 weeks. At ~80% confluency, they were used for studies including toxicant exposure, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence analysis,  (TJ)-permeability assessment, and overexpression of BTB (blood-testis barrier) regulatory genes such as FAK and its phosphomimetic mutants. PFOS was found to induce Sertoli cell injury through disruptive effects on actin microfilaments and microtubule (MT) organization across the cell cytosol. As a consequence, these cytoskeletal networks failed to support cell adhesion at the BTB. Overexpression of a FAK phosphomimetic and constitutively active mutant p-FAK-Y407E in these cells was capable of rescuing the PFOS-induced injury through corrective cellular organization of cytoskeletal elements.PFOS induces human Sertoli cell injury which can be rescued by overexpressing p-FAK-Y407E mutant.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26846226>Differentiated localizations of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase in endothelial cells of rat splenic sinus.</a></h1><p>The splenic sinus endothelium adhering via adherens  and  regulates the passage of blood cells through the splenic cord. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) regulates the focal adhesion complex in the basal part of endothelial cells and is an integrated component of cell-cell adhesion, depending on its phosphorylation status. The objectives of this study are to assess the localization of FAK phosphorylated at  residues and the related proteins of integrin β5, talin, paxillin, p130Cas, vinculin, RhoA, Rac1, Rac2, Cdc42 and VE-cadherin, in the sinus endothelial cells of rat spleen and to examine the roles of FAK in regulating endothelial adhesion and the passage of blood cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy of tissue cryosections revealed that FAK was localized in the entire circumference of sinus endothelial cells and FAK phosphorylated at Try397 residue (pFAKy397) and pFAKy576 were precisely localized in the adherens  of the endothelial cells, whereas pFAKy925 was localized in the basal part of the endothelial cells. Paxillin and vinculin were prominently localized in the basal part of the endothelial cells. Integrin β5, talin and p130Cas were colocalized with FAK in the entire circumference of sinus endothelial cells. RhoA, Rac2 and Cdc42 were localized in the entire circumference of sinus endothelial cells close to FAK, stress fibers and cortical actin filaments. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed that pFAKy397 and pFAKy576 were colocalized with VE-cadherin, RhoA, Rac2 and Cdc42 in the adherens  of the endothelial cells. Possible functional roles of FAK in splenic sinus endothelial cells are also discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21474650>ERK is involved in EGF-mediated protection of , but not adherens , in acetaldehyde-treated Caco-2 cell monolayers.</a></h1><p>The role of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in the mechanism of EGF-mediated prevention of acetaldehyde-induced  disruption was evaluated in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Pretreatment of cell monolayers with EGF attenuated acetaldehyde-induced decrease in resistance and increase in inulin permeability and redistribution of occludin, zona occludens-1 (ZO-1), E-cadherin, and β-catenin from the intercellular . EGF rapidly increased the levels of phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-p38 MAPK, and phospho-JNK1. Pretreatment of cell monolayers with U-0126 (inhibitor of ERK activation), but not SB-202190 and SP-600125 (p38 MAPK and JNK inhibitors), significantly attenuated EGF-mediated prevention of acetaldehyde-induced changes in resistance, inulin permeability, and redistribution of occludin and ZO-1. U-0126, but not SB-202190 and SP-600125, also attenuated EGF-mediated prevention of acetaldehyde effect on the midregion F-actin ring. However, EGF-mediated preservation of junctional distribution of E-cadherin and β-catenin was unaffected by all three inhibitors. Expression of wild-type or constitutively active MEK1 attenuated acetaldehyde-induced redistribution of occludin and ZO-1, whereas dominant-negative MEK1 prevented EGF-mediated preservation of occludin and ZO-1 in acetaldehyde-treated cells. MEK1 expression did not alter E-cadherin distribution in acetaldehyde-treated cells in the presence or absence of EGF. Furthermore, EGF attenuated acetaldehyde-induced -phosphorylation of occludin, ZO-1, claudin-3, and E-cadherin. U-0126, but not SB-202190 and SP-600125, prevented EGF effect on -phosphorylation of occludin and ZO-1, but not claudin-3, E-cadherin, or β-catenin.

The peptide, SOCS1-KIR, is thus capable of downregulating overactive JAK/STAT or NF-kB signaling in somatic cells, including those in many compartments of the eye. Attachment of poly-arginine to this peptide (R9-SOCS1-KIR) allows it to penetrate the plasma membrane in aqueous media. R9-SOCS1-KIR was tested in ARPE-19 cells and was found to attenuate mediators of inflammation by blocking the inflammatory effects of IFNγ, TNFα, or IL-17A. R9-SOCS1-KIR and also protected against TNFα or IL-17A mediated damage to the  properties of ARPE-19 cells, as evidenced by immunostaining with the tight junction protein, zona occludin 1 (ZO-1), and measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) was generated in B10. RIII mice using a peptide of interphotoreceptor retinal binding protein (IRBP) as immunogen. Topical administration of R9-SOCS1-KIR, 2 days before (prophylactic), or 7 days after immunization (therapeutic) protected ocular structure and function as seen by fundoscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and electroretinography (ERG). The ability R9-SOCS1-KIR to suppress ocular inflammation and preserve  properties of retinal pigment epithelium makes it a potential candidate for treatment of autoimmune uveitis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The FERM domain protein Merlin, encoded by the NF2 tumour suppressor gene, is an important mediator of contact inhibition. Merlin was thought to inhibit mitogenic signalling and activate the Hippo pathway by interacting with diverse target-effectors at or near the plasma membrane. However, recent studies highlight that Merlin pleiotropically affects signalling by migrating into the nucleus and inducing a growth-suppressive programme of gene expression through its direct inhibition of the CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. In addition, Merlin promotes the establishment of epithelial adhesion and polarity by recruiting Par3 and aPKC to E-cadherin-dependent , and by ensuring the assembly of . These recent advances suggest that Merlin acts at the cell cortex and in the nucleus in a similar, albeit antithetic, manner to the oncogene β-catenin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28545409>Genetic variation and expression levels of  genes identifies association between MAGI3 and inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with increased intestinal permeability, which involves paracellular passage regulated through  (TJ). The aim of the study was to investigate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located in genes encoding interacting TJ proteins and corresponding expressions, in relation to IBD.Allelic associations between TJ-related genes (F11R, MAGI1, MAGI2, MAGI3, PARD3, PTEN, and TJP1) and IBD, Crohn's disease (CD), or ulcerative colitis (UC) were investigated. PTPN22 was included since it's located in the same genetic region as MAGI3. Gene expression levels were investigated in relation to genotype, inflammatory status, phenotype, and medical treatment.The two strongest allelic associations were observed between IBD and SNPs in MAGI2 (rs6962966) and MAGI3 (rs1343126). Another MAGI3 SNP marker (rs6689879) contributed to increased ileal MAGI3 expression level in non-IBD controls. Furthermore, association between inflammation and decreased expression levels of MAGI3, PTEN, and TJP1 in colonic IBD as well as UC mucosa, and between inflammation and increased expression of PTPN22 in colonic IBD mucosa, was observed.Our findings lend support to a genetic basis for modulation of intestinal epithelial barrier in IBD, and we have identified MAGI3 as a new candidate gene for IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29797543>The serine/threonine protein kinase of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 affects the ability of the pathogen to penetrate the blood-brain .</a></h1><p>Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a zoonotic agent that causes meningitis in humans and pigs. However, the mechanism whereby SS2 crosses the microvasculature endothelium of the brain is not understood. In this study, transposon (TnYLB-1) mutagenesis was used to identify virulence factors potentially associated with invasive ability in pathogenic SS2. A poorly invasive mutant was identified and was found to contain a TnYLB-1 insertion in the serine/threonine kinase (stk) gene. Transwell chambers containing hBMECs were used to model the blood-brain  (BBB). We observed that the SS2 wild-type ZY05719 strain crossed the BBB model more readily than the mutant strain. Hence, we speculated that STK is associated with the ability of crossing blood-brain  in SS2. In vitro, compared with ZY05719, the ability of the stk-deficient strain (Δstk) to adhere to and invade both hBMECs and bEnd.3 cells, as well as to cross the BBB, was significantly attenuated. Immunocytochemistry using antibodies against claudin-5 in bEnd.3 cells showed that infection by ZY05719 disrupted BBB tight junction proteins to a greater extent than in infection by Δstk. The studies revealed that SS2 initially binds at or near intercellular junctions and crosses the BBB via paracellular traversal. Claudin-5 mRNA levels were indistinguishable in ZY05719- and Δstk-infected cells. This result indicated that the decrease of claudin-5 was maybe induced by protein degradation. Cells infected by ZY05719 exhibited higher ubiquitination levels than cells infected by Δstk. This result indicated that ubiquitination was involved in the degradation of claudin-5. Differential proteomic analysis showed that E3 ubiquitin protein ligase HECTD1 decreased by 1.5-fold in Δstk-infected bEnd.3 cells relative to ZY05719-infected cells. Together, the results suggested that STK may affect the expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase HECTD1 and subsequently increase the degradation of claudin-5, thus enabling SS2 to traverse the BBB.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21737448>CaV1.3 channels and intracellular calcium mediate osmotic stress-induced N-terminal c-Jun kinase activation and disruption of  in Caco-2 CELL MONOLAYERS.</a></h1><p>We investigated the role of a Ca(2+) channel and intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in osmotic stress-induced JNK activation and  disruption in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Osmotic stress-induced  disruption was attenuated by 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxyl)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA)-mediated intracellular Ca(2+) depletion. Depletion of extracellular Ca(2+) at the apical surface, but not basolateral surface, also prevented  disruption. Similarly, thapsigargin-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) depletion attenuated  disruption. Thapsigargin or extracellular Ca(2+) depletion partially reduced osmotic stress-induced rise in [Ca(2+)](i), whereas thapsigargin and extracellular Ca(2+) depletion together resulted in almost complete loss of rise in [Ca(2+)](i). L-type Ca(2+) channel blockers (isradipine and diltiazem) or knockdown of the Ca(V)1.3 channel abrogated [Ca(2+)](i) rise and disruption of . Osmotic stress-induced JNK2 activation was abolished by BAPTA and isradipine, and partially reduced by extracellular Ca(2+) depletion, thapsigargin, or Ca(V)1.3 knockdown. Osmotic stress rapidly induced c-Src activation, which was significantly attenuated by BAPTA, isradipine, or extracellular Ca(2+) depletion.  disruption by osmotic stress was blocked by  kinase inhibitors (genistein and PP2) or siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Src. Osmotic stress induced a robust increase in  phosphorylation of occludin, which was attenuated by BAPTA, SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), or PP2.

Angiopoietins (Ang-1/Ang-2) act as antagonizing molecules to regulate angiogenesis, vascular stability, vascular permeability and lymphatic integrity. However, the precise role of angiopoietin/Tie2 signaling at the BBB remains unclear. We investigated the influence of Ang-2 on BBB permeability in wild-type and gain-of-function (GOF) mice and demonstrated an increase in permeability by Ang-2, both in vitro and in vivo. Expression analysis of brain endothelial cells from Ang-2 GOF mice showed a downregulation of /adherens  molecules and increased caveolin-1, a vesicular permeability-related molecule. Immunohistochemistry revealed reduced pericyte coverage in Ang-2 GOF mice that was supported by electron microscopy analyses, which demonstrated defective intra-endothelial  with increased vesicles and decreased/disrupted glycocalyx. These results demonstrate that Ang-2 mediates permeability via paracellular and transcellular routes. In patients suffering from stroke, a cerebrovascular disorder associated with BBB disruption, Ang-2 levels were upregulated. In mice, Ang-2 GOF resulted in increased infarct sizes and vessel permeability upon experimental stroke, implicating a role of Ang-2 in stroke pathophysiology. Increased permeability and stroke size were rescued by activation of Tie2 signaling using a vascular endothelial protein  phosphatase inhibitor and were independent of VE-cadherin phosphorylation. We thus identified Ang-2 as an endothelial cell-derived regulator of BBB permeability. We postulate that novel therapeutics targeting Tie2 signaling could be of potential use for opening the BBB for increased CNS drug delivery or tighten it in neurological disorders associated with cerebrovascular leakage and brain edema.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30291936>The organophosphate pesticide methamidophos opens the blood-testis  and covalently binds to ZO-2 in mice.</a></h1><p>Methamidophos (MET) is an organophosphate (OP) pesticide widely used in agriculture in developing countries. MET causes adverse effects in male reproductive function in humans and experimental animals, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. We explored the effect of MET on mice testes (5 mg/kg/day/4 days), finding that this pesticide opens the blood-testis  and perturbs spermatogenesis, generating the appearance of immature germ cells in the epididymis. In the seminiferous tubules, MET treatment changed the level of expression or modified the stage-specific localization of tight junction (TJ) proteins ZO-1, ZO-2, occludin, and claudin-3. In contrast, claudin-11 was barely altered. MET also modified the shape of claudin-11, and ZO-2 at the cell border, from a zigzag to a more linear pattern. In addition, MET diminished the expression of ZO-2 in spermatids present in seminiferous tubules, induced the phosphorylation of ZO-2 and occludin in testes and reduced the interaction between these proteins assessed by co-immunoprecipitation. MET formed covalent bonds with ZO-2 in serine,  and lysine residues. The covalent modifications formed on ZO-2 at putative phosphorylation sites might interfere with ZO-2 interaction with regulatory molecules and other TJ proteins. MET bonds formed at ZO-2 ubiquitination sites likely interfere with ZO-2 degradation and TJ sealing, based on results obtained in cultured epithelial cells transfected with ZO-2 mutated at a MET target lysine residue. Our results shed light on MET male reproductive toxicity and are important to improve regulations regarding the use of OP pesticides and to protect the health of agricultural workers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, EMT-regulated individual cancer cell invasion is difficult to detect in clinical samples. Emerging evidence implies that EMT is correlated to collective cell migration and invasion with unknown mechanisms. We show that the EMT transcription factor Snail elicits collective migration in squamous cell carcinoma by inducing the expression of a  junctional protein, claudin-11. Mechanistically, -phosphorylated claudin-11 activates Src, which suppresses RhoA activity at intercellular  through p190RhoGAP, maintaining stable cell-cell contacts. In head and neck cancer patients, the Snail-claudin-11 axis prompts the formation of circulating tumour cell clusters, which correlate with tumour progression. Overexpression of snail correlates with increased claudin-11, and both are associated with a worse outcome. This finding extends the current understanding of EMT-mediated cellular migration via a non-individual type of movement to prompt cancer progression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21168935> phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and claudin-5 is associated with TGF-β1-induced permeability of centrally derived vascular endothelium.</a></h1><p>Breakdown of the inner blood-retinal barrier and the blood-brain barrier is associated with changes in  and adherens -associated proteins that link vascular endothelial cells. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 increases the paracellular permeability of vascular endothelial monolayers through  phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and claudin-5. Bovine retinal and human brain capillary endothelial cells were grown as monolayers on coated polycarbonate membranes. Paracellular permeability was studied by measuring the equilibration of (14)C-inulin or fluorescence-labelled dextran. Changes in VE-cadherin and claudin-5 expression were studied by immunocytochemistry (ICC) and quantified by cell-based enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).  phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and claudin-5 was studied by ICC, immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. We found that exposure of endothelial cells to TGF-β1 caused a dose-dependent increase in paracellular permeability as reflected by increases in the equilibration of (14)C-inulin. This effect was enhanced by the  phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate and attenuated by the  kinase inhibitor lavendustin A. ICC and cell-based ELISA revealed that TGF-β1 induced both dose- and time-dependent decreases in VE-cadherin and claudin-5 expression. Assessment of cell viability indicated that changes in these -associated proteins were not due to endothelial death or injury. ICC revealed that  phosphorylation of endothelial monolayers was greatly enhanced by TGF-β1 treatment, and immunoprecipitation of cell lysates showed increased  phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and claudin-5. Our results suggest that  phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and claudin-5 is involved in the increased paracellular permeability of central nervous system-derived vascular endothelium induced by TGF-β1.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

Striatin family members have no intrinsic catalytic activity, but rather function as scaffolding proteins. Remarkably, they organize multiple diverse, large signaling complexes that participate in a variety of cellular processes. Moreover, they appear to be regulatory/targeting subunits for the major eukaryotic serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A. In addition, striatin family members associate with germinal center kinase III kinases as well as other novel components, earning these assemblies the name striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complexes. Recently, there has been a great increase in functional and mechanistic studies aimed at identifying and understanding the roles of STRIPAK and STRIPAK-like complexes in cellular processes of multiple organisms. These studies have identified novel STRIPAK and STRIPAK-like complexes and have explored their roles in specific signaling pathways. Together, the results of these studies have sparked increased interest in striatin family complexes because they have revealed roles in signaling, cell cycle control, apoptosis, vesicular trafficking, Golgi assembly, cell polarity, cell migration, neural and vascular development, and cardiac function. Moreover, STRIPAK complexes have been connected to clinical conditions, including cardiac disease, diabetes, autism, and cerebral cavernous malformation. In this review, we discuss the expression, localization, and protein domain structure of striatin family members. Then we consider the diverse complexes these proteins and their homologs form in various organisms, emphasizing what is known regarding function and regulation. Finally, we explore possible roles of striatin family complexes in disease, especially cerebral cavernous malformation.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A growing body of evidence suggests epithelial cells also directly exchange information at cell-cell contacts via the Eph family of receptor  kinases and their membrane-associated ephrin ligands. Ligand-dependent and -independent signaling via Eph receptors as well as reverse signaling through ephrins impact epithelial tissue homeostasis by organizing stem cell compartments and regulating cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, differentiation, and survival.

In this work the bone marrow microenvironment in vitro was recreated both by tailoring scaffolds physical properties and by functionalizing electrospun polymer fibers with a bioactive peptide derived from domain IV of perlecan heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Electrospun poly (epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) fibers and PCL/gelatin composite scaffolds were modified covalently with perlecan domain IV (PlnDIV) peptide. The expression of  protein (E-cadherin) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation on  397 also were investigated. The described bioactive motif significantly enhanced adherence and infiltration of the metastatic prostate cancer cells on all modified electrospun substrates by day 5 post-seeding. Cells cultured on PlnDIV-modified matrices organized stress fibers and increased proliferation at statistically significant rates. Additional findings suggest that presence of PlnDIV peptide in the matrix reduced expression of  protein and binding to PlnDIV peptide was accompanied by increased focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation on  397. We conclude that PlnDIV peptide supports key signaling events leading to proliferation, survival, and migration of C4-2B cancer cells; hence its incorporation into electrospun matrix is a key improvement to create a successful three-dimensional (3-D) pharmacokinetic cancer model.Copyright (c)  2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Endoneurial endothelial cells form the blood-nerve barrier (BNB). The molecular pathways responsible for endoneurial microvascular barrier formation in humans are not fully understood. We tested the effect of different mitogens on the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of confluent primary human endoneurial endothelial cell (pHEndEC) cultures following serum withdrawal (mimicking diffuse endothelial injury) in vitro. We show that glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF, 1 ng/mL) sufficiently induced a maximal 114.2% recovery in TEER over basal conditions 48 h after serum withdrawal. Solute permeability to high molecular weight dextran was reduced by 52.4% following GDNF treatment. GDNF-mediated increase in TEER was dependent on RET -kinase signaling pathways and mildly enhanced by cyclic adenosine monophosphate in combination with maximal concentrations of multiple redundant mitogens. There was no significant increase in adherens or  proteins β-catenin, VE-Cadherin, zona occludens-1 and occludin following GDNF treatment. GDNF induced a small increase in total claudin-5 protein expression without significant increase in messenger RNA or modulation in  phosphorylation following serum withdrawal. Indirect immunocytochemistry revealed membrane relocation of longitudinal F-actin cytoskeletal filaments in pHEndECs following GDNF treatment, resulting in more continuous intercellular contacts that formed adherens and . Together, these results demonstrate a sufficient role for GDNF in human BNB recovery following serum withdrawal in vitro, facilitated primarily by endothelial cell cytoskeletal reorganization. These observations provide insights into the regulation of human BNB function during recovery from peripheral nerve injury.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Tumor vasculature was measured by immunohistochemistry using three endothelial cell markers: CD31 (mature), CD105 (immature/proliferating), and CD11b (monocytic). We assessed oxygenation, , compactness, and pressure within tumors, along with the frequency and phenotype of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) following treatment with antiangiogenic TKIs alone, vaccine alone, or the combination of a TKI with vaccine. The combined regimen decreased tumor vasculature, compactness, , and pressure, leading to vascular normalization and increased tumor oxygenation. This combination therapy also increased TILs, including tumor antigen-specific CD8 T cells, and elevated the expression of activation markers FAS-L, CXCL-9, CD31, and CD105 in MDSCs and TAMs, leading to reduced tumor volumes and an increase in the number of tumor-free animals. The improved antitumor activity induced by combining antiangiogenic TKIs with vaccine may be the result of activated lymphoid and myeloid cells in the TME, resulting from vascular normalization, decreased tumor-cell density, and the consequent improvement in vascular perfusion and oxygenation. Therapies that alter tumor architecture can, thus, have a dramatic impact on the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy.©2014 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21703263>An angiogenic inhibitor, cyclic RGDfV, attenuates MPTP-induced dopamine neuron toxicity.</a></h1><p>We previously demonstrated that several dopamine (DA) neurotoxins produced punctate areas of FITC-labeled albumin (FITC-LA) leakage in the substantia nigra and striatum suggesting blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. Further, this leakage was co-localized with αvβ3 integrin up-regulation, a marker for angiogenesis. This suggested that the FITC-LA leakage might have been a result of angiogenesis. To assess the possible role of angiogenesis in DA neuron loss, we treated mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and on the following day treated with cyRGDfV, a cyclic peptide that binds to integrin αvβ3 and prevents angiogenesis. Post-treatment for 3 days (b.i.d.) with cyRGDfV blocked the MPTP-induced upregulation of integrin β3 immunoreactivity (a marker for angiogenesis), leakage of FITC-LA into brain parenchyma (a marker for BBB disruption) as well as the down regulation of Zona Occludin-1 (ZO-1; a marker for  integrity). In addition, cyRGDfV also completely prevented  hydroxylase immunoreactive cell loss (a marker for DA neurons) and markedly attenuated the up-regulation of activated microglia (Iba1 cell counts and morphology). These data suggest that cyRGDfV, and perhaps other anti-angiogenic drugs, are neuroprotective following acute MPTP treatment and may suggest that compensatory angiogenesis and BBB dysfunction may contribute to inflammation and DA neuron loss.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Consequently, in inflammation the BBB becomes dysfunctional, facilitating leukocyte traversal of the  and accumulation of immune cells within the brain. The extracellular matrix (ECM) also contributes to BBB  but the significance of the main ECM receptors, the β integrins also expressed on endothelial cells, is less well understood. To evaluate whether β integrin function is affected during inflammation and impacts  function, we used a transformed human brain microvascular endothelial cell (THBMEC)-based Interleukin 1β (IL-1β)-induced inflammatory in vitro BBB model. We demonstrate that IL-1β increases cell-matrix adhesion and induces a redistribution of active β integrins to the basal surface. In particular, binding of αβ integrin to its ligand fibronectin is enhanced and αβ integrin-dependent signalling is upregulated. Additionally, localisation of the tight junction protein claudin-5 is altered. Blockade of the αβ integrin reduces the IL-1β-induced transendothelial migration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). These data imply that IL-1β-induced inflammation not only destabilizes tight junctions but also increases αβ integrin-dependent cell-matrix adhesion to fibronectin.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Macrophage stimulating protein (MSP) is a hepatocyte growth factor-like protein that mediates its functions via activating receptor  kinase recepteur d'origine nantais (RON). Grb2-associated binder 1 (GAB1) is a docking protein that mediates downstream receptor signal transduction pathways. This study aimed to evaluate the role of MSP and RON activated signaling pathway in preserving BBB  after collagenase-induced ICH. ICH mice received recombinant human MSP (rhMSP) or rhMSP combined with siRNA knockdown of RON or GAB1. rhMSP was administered by intranasal route 1 h after ICH. Brain edema, neurobehavior, BBB tight junction protein expression, and BBB permeability were evaluated. The expression of endogenous MSP and p-RON was decreased after ICH. Exogenous rhMSP administration reduced brain edema, neurological deficits, BBB permeability, and increased the expression of tight junction proteins in ICH mice. rhMSP administration increased the expression of p-RON, p-GAB1, p-Src, nuclear β-catenin, and tight junction proteins after ICH. These effects were reversed with RON and GAB1 siRNA. We conclude that MSP activation of RON preserved BBB  via GAB-1/Src/β-catenin pathway, thereby reducing brain edema and neurological deficits after ICH in mice.© 2018 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25048686>ZAP-70 genotype disrupts the relationship between microbiota and host, leading to spondyloarthritis and ileitis in SKG mice.</a></h1><p>The spondyloarthritides share genetic susceptibility, interleukin-23 (IL-23) dependence, and the involvement of microbiota. The aim of the current study was to elucidate how host genetics influence gut microbiota and the relationship between microbiota and organ inflammation in spondyloarthritides.BALB/c ZAP-70(W163C) -mutant (SKG) mice, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4)-deficient SKG mice, and wild-type BALB/c mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions. SKG and wild-type BALB/c mice were maintained under germ-free conditions, and some of these mice were recolonized with altered Schaedler flora. All of the mice were injected intraperitoneally with microbial β-1,3-glucan (curdlan). Arthritis, spondylitis, and ileitis were assessed histologically. Microbiome composition was analyzed in serial fecal samples obtained from mice that were co-housed beginning at the time of weaning, using 454 pyrosequencing. Infiltrating cells and cytokines in the peritoneal cavity were measured by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cytokine, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker, and  protein transcription was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.Microbiota content and response to curdlan varied according to whether T cell receptor signal strength was normal or was impaired due to the ZAP-70(W163C) mutation. Curdlan triggered acute inflammation regardless of the presence of the SKG allele or microbiota. However, no or limited microbiota content attenuated the severity of arthritis. In contrast, ileal IL-23 expression, ER stress, lymph node IL-17A production, goblet cell loss, and ileitis development were microbiota-dependent. Ileitis but not arthritis was suppressed by microbiota transfer upon co-housing SKG mice with wild-type BALB/c mice, as well as by TLR-4 deficiency.The interaction between immunogenetic background and host microbiota leads to an IL-23-dependent loss of mucosal function, triggering ileitis in response to curdlan.Copyright © 2014 by the American College of Rheumatology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24550116>Developmental stratification of the mammary epithelium occurs through symmetry-breaking vertical divisions of apically positioned luminal cells.</a></h1><p>Mammary ducts are elongated during development by stratified epithelial structures, known as terminal end buds (TEBs). TEBs exhibit reduced apicobasal polarity and extensive proliferation. A major unanswered question concerns the mechanism by which the simple ductal epithelium stratifies during TEB formation. We sought to elucidate this mechanism using real-time imaging of growth factor-induced stratification in 3D cultures of mouse primary epithelial organoids. We hypothesized that stratification could result from vertical divisions in either the apically positioned luminal epithelial cells or the basally positioned myoepithelial cells. Stratification initiated exclusively from vertical apical cell divisions, both in 3D culture and in vivo. During vertical apical divisions, only the mother cell retained  and segregated apical membranes. Vertical daughter cells initiated an unpolarized cell population located between the luminal and myoepithelial cells, similar to the unpolarized body cells in the TEB. As stratification and loss of apicobasal polarity are early hallmarks of cancer, we next determined the cellular mechanism of oncogenic stratification. Expression of activated ERBB2 induced neoplastic stratification through analogous vertical divisions of apically positioned luminal epithelial cells. However, ERBB2-induced stratification was accompanied by tissue overgrowth and acute loss of both  and apical polarity. Expression of phosphomimetic MEK (MEK1DD), a major ERBB2 effector, also induced stratification through vertical apical cell divisions. However, MEK1DD-expressing organoids exhibited normal levels of growth and retained apicobasal polarity. We conclude that both normal and neoplastic stratification are accomplished through receptor  kinase signaling dependent vertical cell divisions within the luminal epithelial cell layer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21679692>The  protein ZO-2 and Janus kinase 1 mediate intercellular communications in vascular smooth muscle cells.</a></h1><p>Recent evidence points to a multifunctional role of ZO-2, the  protein of the MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like) family. Though ZO-2 has been found in cell types lacking  structures, such as vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), little is known about ZO-2 function in these cells. We provide evidence that ZO-2 mediates specific homotypic cell-to-cell contacts between VSMC. Using mass spectrometry we found that ZO-2 is associated with the non-receptor  kinase Jak1. By generating specific ZO-2 constructs we further found that the N-terminal fragment of ZO-2 molecule is responsible for this interaction. Adenovirus-based expression of Jak1 inactive mutant demonstrated that Jak1 mediates ZO-2  phosphorylation. By means of RNA silencing, expression of Jak1 mutant form and fluorescently labeled ZO-2 fusion protein we further specified that active Jak1, but not Jak1 inactive mutant, mediates ZO-2 localization to the sites of intercellular contacts. We identified the urokinase receptor uPAR as a pre-requisite for these cellular events. Functional requirement of the revealed signaling complex for VSMC network formation was confirmed in experiments using Matrigel and in contraction assay. Our findings imply involvement of the ZO-2  independent signaling complex containing Jak1 and uPAR in VSMC intercellular communications. This mechanism may contribute to vascular remodeling in occlusive cardiovascular diseases and in arteriogenesis.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

These symptoms are primarily caused by  function disruption, which is controlled by intercellular junctions. In this study, we investigated whether reactive oxygen species (ROS) are closely involved in tight junction disruption of primary human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells induced by infection of RV .Incubation with RV resulted in disruption of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, E-cadherin, claudin-1, and occludin) in HNE cells. Pretreatment with diphenylene iodonium (DPI) decreased RV-induced disruption of tight junction in HNE cells. RV-induced generation of ROS was diminished by DPI. However, rotenone was not inhibited in HNE cells following incubation with RV. Rhinoviruses resulted in a marked decrease in protein phosphatases activity and an increase in protein  phosphorylation levels in HNE cells. Diphenylene iodonium inhibited the RV-induced inactivation of phosphatases and phosphorylation of protein . In addition, inhibition of protein  phosphatases with phenylarsine oxide resulted in a marked decrease in protein phosphatase activity and disruption of tight junction proteins in HNE cells.Our results suggest that ROS-mediated inhibition of phosphatases plays a crucial role in disruption of tight junctions in HNE cells by RV. The data suggest that RV infection may damage nasal epithelial  function.NA Laryngoscope, 128:E393-E401, 2018.© 2018 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.</p></html>
