Numerous studies have reported the crucial role of caveolin-1 (CAV1) in response to invading microbes; yet, very little is known about molluscan CAV1. In this study, we identified and characterized CAV1 ortholog from the disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus (HdCAV1). The cDNA sequence of HdCAV1 is 826 bp long and encodes a 127-amino acid polypeptide. Characteristic caveolin superfamily domain (Glu - Lys) and two possible transmembrane domains (Cys -  and  - Phe) were identified in the HdCAV1 protein. Homology analysis revealed that HdCAV1 shared higher identity (>47%) with molluscans, but lower identity with other species. Phylogenetic tree constructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method revealed a distinct evolutionary pathway for molluscans. Transcriptional analysis by SYBR Green qPCR showed the highest expression of HdCAV1 mRNA in late veliger stage, as compared to that in other embryonic developmental stages of disk abalone. In adult animals, gill tissue showed highest HdCAV1 transcript levels under normal physiological condition. Stimulations with two bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes), viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, and two pathogen-associated molecular patterns (LPS and poly I:C) significantly modulated the expression of HdCAV1 transcripts. Collectively, these data suggest that CAV1 plays an important role in embryogenesis and host immune defense in disk abalone.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the first PfSPZ Vaccine trial ever in a malaria-endemic population, Vδ2 γδ T cells were significantly elevated and Vγ9/Vδ2 transcripts ranked as the most upregulated in vaccinees who were protected from  infection. In a mouse model, absence of γδ T cells during vaccination impaired protective CD8 T cell responses and ablated sterile protection. γδ T cells were not required for circumsporozoite protein-specific Ab responses, and γδ T cell depletion before infectious challenge did not ablate protection. γδ T cells alone were insufficient to induce protection and required the presence of CD8α dendritic cells. In the absence of γδ T cells, CD8α dendritic cells did not accumulate in the livers of vaccinated mice. Altogether, our results show that γδ T cells were essential for the induction of sterile  during whole-organism vaccination.Copyright © 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28105330>Genetic markers associated with resistance to beta-lactam and quinolone antimicrobials in non-typhoidal  isolates from humans and animals in central Ethiopia.</a></h1><p>Beta-lactam and quinolone antimicrobials are commonly used for treatment of infections caused by non-typhoidal  (NTS) and other pathogens. Resistance to these classes of antimicrobials has increased significantly in the recent years. However, little is known on the genetic basis of resistance to these drugs in  isolates from Ethiopia. isolates with reduced susceptibility to beta-lactams ( = 43) were tested for genes encoding for beta-lactamase enzymes, and those resistant to quinolones ( = 29) for mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) as well as plasmid mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes using PCR and sequencing.Beta-lactamase genes () were detected in 34 (79.1%) of the isolates. The dominant  gene was TEM, recovered from 33 (76.7%) of the isolates, majority being TEM-1 (24, 72.7%) followed by TEM-57, (10, 30.3%). The OXA-10 and CTX-M-15 were detected only in a single  Concord human isolate. Double substitutions in A (Ser83-Phe + Asp87-Gly) as well as C (Thr57-Ser + Ser80-) subunits of the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) were detected in all  Kentucky isolates with high level resistance to both nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. Single amino acid substitutions, Ser83-Phe ( = 4) and Ser83- ( = 1) were also detected in the A gene. An isolate of . Miami susceptible to nalidixic acid but intermediately resistant to ciprofloxacin had Thr57-Ser and an additional novel mutation (Tyr83-Phe) in the C gene. Plasmid mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes investigated were not detected in any of the isolates. In some isolates with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and/or nalidixic acid, no mutations in QRDR or PMQR genes were detected. Over half of the quinolone resistant isolates in the current study 17 (58.6%) were also resistant to at least one of the beta-lactam antimicrobials.Acquisition of TEM was the principal beta-lactamase resistance mechanism and mutations within QRDR of A and C were the primary mechanism for resistance to quinolones. Further study on extended spectrum beta-lactamase and quinolone resistance mechanisms in other gram negative pathogens is recommended.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27531961>Unraveling the essential role of CysK in CDI toxin activation.</a></h1><p>Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is a widespread mechanism of bacterial competition. CDI(+) bacteria deliver the toxic C-terminal region of contact-dependent inhibition A proteins (CdiA-CT) into neighboring target bacteria and produce CDI  proteins (CdiI) to protect against self-inhibition. The CdiA-CT(EC536) deployed by uropathogenic Escherichia coli 536 (EC536) is a bacterial toxin 28 (Ntox28) domain that only exhibits ribonuclease activity when bound to the cysteine biosynthetic enzyme O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase A (CysK). Here, we present crystal structures of the CysK/CdiA-CT(EC536) binary complex and the neutralized ternary complex of CysK/CdiA-CT/CdiI(EC536) CdiA-CT(EC536) inserts its C-terminal Gly--Gly- peptide tail into the active-site cleft of CysK to anchor the interaction. Remarkably, E. coli serine O-acetyltransferase uses a similar Gly-Asp-Gly- motif to form the "cysteine synthase" complex with CysK. The cysteine synthase complex is found throughout bacteria, protozoa, and plants, indicating that CdiA-CT(EC536) exploits a highly conserved protein-protein interaction to promote its toxicity. CysK significantly increases CdiA-CT(EC536) thermostability and is required for toxin interaction with tRNA substrates. These observations suggest that CysK stabilizes the toxin fold, thereby organizing the nuclease active site for substrate recognition and catalysis. By contrast, Ntox28 domains from Gram-positive bacteria lack C-terminal Gly--Gly- motifs, suggesting that they do not interact with CysK. We show that the Ntox28 domain from Ruminococcus lactaris is significantly more thermostable than CdiA-CT(EC536), and its intrinsic tRNA-binding properties support CysK-independent nuclease activity. The striking differences between related Ntox28 domains suggest that CDI toxins may be under evolutionary pressure to maintain low global stability.</p></html>
