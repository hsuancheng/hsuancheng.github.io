The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of diets supplemented with cooked red lentils on the colonic microenvironment (microbiota composition and activity and epithelial barrier integrity and function). C57Bl/6 male mice were fed one of five diets: a control basal diet (BD), a BD-supplemented diet with , 10 or 20% cooked red lentils (by weight), or a BD-supplemented diet with 0.7% pectin (equivalent soluble fiber level as found in the 20% lentil diet). Red lentil supplementation resulted in increased: (1) fecal microbiota α-diversity; (2) abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria (e.g.,  and ); (3) concentrations of fecal SCFAs; (4) mRNA expression of SCFA receptors (G-protein-coupled receptors () and /adherens  proteins (Zona Occulden-1 (), Claudin-2, E-cadherin). Overall, 20% lentil had the greatest impact on colon health outcomes, which were in part explained by a change in the soluble and insoluble fiber profile of the diet. These results support recent public health recommendations to increase consumption of plant-based protein foods for improved health, in particular intestinal health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959978>Mechanistic Studies on the Absorption-Enhancing Effects of Gemini Surfactant on the Intestinal Absorption of Poorly Absorbed Hydrophilic Drugs in Rats.</a></h1><p>Generally, the use of absorption enhancers might be the most effective approaches to ameliorate the enteric absorption of poorly absorbed substances. Among numerous absorption enhancers, we already reported that a gemini surfactant, sodium dilauramidoglutamide lysine (SLG-30) with two hydrophobic and two hydrophilic moieties, is a novel and promising adjuvant with a high potency in improving the absorption safely. Here, we examined and elucidated the absorption-improving mechanisms of SLG-30 in the enteric absorption of substances. SLG-30 increased the intestinal absorption of (6)-carboxyfluorescein (CF) to a greater level than the typical absorption enhancers, including sodium glycocholate and sodium laurate, as evaluated by an  closed-loop method. Furthermore, SLG-30 significantly lowered the fluorescence anisotropy of dansyl chloride (DNS-Cl), suggesting that it might increase the fluidity of protein sections in the intestinal cell membranes. Moreover, SLG-30 significantly lowered the transepithelial-electrical resistance (TEER) values of Caco-2 cells, suggesting that it might open the  (TJs) between the enteric epithelial cells. Additionally, the levels of claudin-1 and claudin-4 expression decreased in the presence of SLG-30. These outcomes propose that SLG-30 might improve the enteric transport of poorly absorbed substances through both transcellular and paracellular routes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31119823>In situ molecular characterization of endoneurial microvessels that form the blood-nerve barrier in normal human adult peripheral nerves.</a></h1><p>The blood-nerve barrier (BNB) formed by -forming endoneurial microvessels located in the innermost compartment of peripheral nerves, and the perineurium serve to maintain the internal microenvironment required for normal signal transduction. The specific molecular components that define the normal adult human BNB are not fully known. Guided by data derived from the adult human BNB transcriptome, we evaluated the in situ expression of 25 junctional complex, transporter, cell membrane, and cytoskeletal proteins in four histologically normal adult sural nerves by indirect fluorescent immunohistochemistry to determine proteins specifically expressed by restrictive endoneurial microvascular endothelium. Using Ulex Europaeus Agglutinin-1 expression to detect endothelial cells, we ascertained that the selected proteins were uniformly expressed in ≥90% of endoneurial microvessels. P-glycoprotein (also known as adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily B member 1) and solute carrier family 1 member 1 demonstrated restricted expression by endoneurial endothelium only, with classic  protein claudin- also expressed on fenestrated epineurial macrovessels, and vascular-specific adherens  protein cadherin- also expressed by the perineurium. The expression profiles of the selected proteins provide significant insight into the molecular composition of normal adult peripheral nerves. Further work is required to elucidate the human adult BNB molecular signature in order to better understand its development and devise strategies to restore function in peripheral neuropathies.© 2019 Peripheral Nerve Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430854>Electrical Stimulation of the Mesencephalic Locomotor Region Has No Impact on Blood-Brain Barrier Alterations after Cerebral Photothrombosis in Rats.</a></h1><p>Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption is a critical event after ischemic stroke, which results in edema formation and hemorrhagic transformation of infarcted tissue. BBB dysfunction following stroke is partly mediated by proinflammatory agents. We recently have shown that high frequency stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR-HFS) exerts an antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory effect in the border zone of cerebral photothrombotic stroke in rats. Whether MLR-HFS also has an impact on BBB dysfunction in the early stage of stroke is unknown. In this study, rats were subjected to photothrombotic stroke of the sensorimotor cortex and implantation of a stimulating microelectrode into the ipsilesional MLR. Thereafter, either HFS or sham stimulation of the MLR was applied for 24 h. After scarifying the rats, BBB disruption was assessed by determining albumin extravasation and  integrity (claudin 3, claudin , and occludin) using Western blot analyses and immunohistochemistry. In addition, by applying zymography, expression of pro-metalloproteinase-9 (pro-MMP-9) was analyzed. No differences were found regarding infarct size and BBB dysfunction between stimulated and unstimulated animals 24 h after induction of stroke. Our results indicate that MLR-HFS neither improves nor worsens the damaged BBB after stroke. Attenuating cytokines/chemokines in the perilesional area, as mediated by MLR-HFS, tend to play a less significant role in preventing the BBB integrity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31389456>Nomilin protects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion induced neurological deficits and blood-brain barrier disruption via the Nrf2 pathway.</a></h1><p>Oxidative stress is considered to play an important role in the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. The nuclear transcription factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1 (NQO1) pathway has been considered as a potential target for neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Nomilin (NOM) is a limonoid compound obtained from the extracts of citrus fruits. The purpose of our study was to determine whether NOM could exert beneficial effects in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion rats. Firstly, NOM treatment significantly mitigated cell death and decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and ROS production in SH-SY5Y cells induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), which was almost abolished by Nrf2 knockdown. Secondly, NOM improved infarct area, brain edema and neurological deficits in an experimental stroke rat model via middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Furthermore, NOM attenuated blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in MCAO rats, which might be associated with alleviating the loss of  proteins, including ZO-1 and occludin-. Further results revealed that NOM treatment effectively mitigated oxidative stress and facilitated the expressions of Nrf2 and NQO1, which might confirm that the loss of  proteins in the microvasculature was likely mediated by oxidative stress. In conclusion, our study provided evidence that the protective effects of NOM in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion rats were related to the Nrf2/NQO1 pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075872>The Immunomodulatory Properties of Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Probiotics: A Novel Approach for the Management of Gastrointestinal Diseases.</a></h1><p>Probiotics, included in functional foods, nutritional supplements, or nutraceuticals, exhibit different beneficial effects on gut function. They are extensively used to improve the digestive processes as well as reduce the symptoms and progression of different diseases. Probiotics have shown to improve dysbiosis and modulate the immune response of the host by interacting with different cell types. Probiotics and the host can interact in a direct way, but it is becoming apparent that communication occurs also through extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from probiotics. EVs are key for bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-host interactions, since they carry a wide variety of components that can modulate different signaling pathways, including those involved in the immune response. Interestingly, EVs are recently starting to be considered as an alternative to probiotics in those cases for which the use of live bacteria could be dangerous, such as immunocompromised individuals or situations where the intestinal barrier is impaired. EVs can spread through the mucus layer and interact with the host, avoiding the risk of sepsis. This review summarizes the existing knowledge about EVs from different probiotic strains, their properties, and their potential use for the prevention or treatment of different gastrointestinal diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536969>Biomanufacturing of a novel <i>in vitro</i> biomimetic blood-brain barrier model.</a></h1><p>Glioma is a malignant tumor that severely threatens human health. However, it is difficult for most therapeutic agents to penetrate through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and exhibit their antineoplastic activity in the brain. In this manuscript, a biomimetic in vitro BBB model was created by a composite process, this model can provide a significant foundation for the research of drug transport, tumor treatment, tumor microenvironment and other fields. A series of tests and comparative experiments were performed to evaluate this model. The tests showed that the model enabled preliminary simulation of the structure and function of the BBB. Experimental results demonstrated: 1) the new technology enabled controlled release of growth factors and successfully induced endothelial progenitor cells into endothelial cells. Compared with the traditional gold standard, the Transwell model, the expression of four specific proteins that are related to the BBB characteristics was significantly increased (alkaline phosphatase(ALP) by 89.82%, γ-GT by 88.86%, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) by 57.40%, and Claudin- by 102.32%) in this model; 2) Astrocytes had a promoting effect on the microvascular endothelial cells to form  (ZO-1 increased by 249.35%, Claudin- increased by 184.99%), and there was a great difference between whether these two types of cells were contact cultured or not; 3) The gelatinous cell U118 had a destructive effect on the  of BBB (ZO-1 decreased by 55.86%, Claudin- decreased by 37.84%).© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959170>Gut microbiota modulation and anti-inflammatory properties of anthocyanins from the fruits of Lycium ruthenicum Murray in dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in mice.</a></h1><p>In the present study, the therapeutic effects of crude anthocyanins (ACN) from the fruits of Lycium ruthenicum Murray and the main monomer of ACN, petunidin 3-O-[rhamnopyranosyl-(trans-p-coumaroyl)]--O-[β-d-glucopyranoside] (P3G), on the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice were investigated. Both ACN and P3G showed intestinal anti-inflammatory effects, evidenced by restoration of various physical signs (body weight, feed quantity, solid fecal weight and colon length were increased, and DAI score was decreased), reduction of the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and related mRNA (such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IFN-γ), and promotion of the intestinal barrier function by histological and immunofluorescence analysis (proteins such as ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1 were increased). Furthermore, the effects on gut microbiota community of DSS-induced colitis in mice have been investigated. It was found that Porphyromonadaceae, Helicobacter, Parasutterella, Parabacteroides, Oscillibacter and Lachnospiraceae were the key bacteria associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Taken together, P3G and ACN ameliorated DSS-induced colitis in mice through three aspects including blocking proinflammatory cytokines, increasing  protein and modulating gut microbiota. What's more, P3G showed better anti-inflammatory effects than ACN.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated whether fecal proteolytic activity is increased during pouchitis and results in epithelial barrier dysfunction through protease activating receptor (PAR) activation, and assessed whether the intestinal microbiome may be the source of the proteases.Fecal samples were measured for protease activity using a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-casein florescence assay. Caco-2 cell monolayers were exposed to fecal supernatants to assess permeability to FITC-dextran.  protein integrity and PAR activation were assessed by immunoblot and immunofluorescence. A truncated PAR2 protein in Caco-2 cells was achieved by stable transfection using CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid. PAR2 activation in pouch biopsies was examined using antibodies directed to the N-terminus of the protein. Microbial composition was analyzed using Illumina MiSeq platform of the 16S rRNA gene.Ten pouchitis patients, 6 normal pouch (NP) patients and 9 healthy controls (HC) were recruited. The pouchitis patients exhibited a .19- and .35-fold higher fecal protease (FP) activity (p ≤ 0.05) compared to the NP and HC participants, respectively. The Haemophilus species was positively associated with FP activity (R=0.718, FDR<0.1).Fecal supernatants from pouchitis patients activated PAR2 on Caco-2 monolayers, disrupted TJ proteins, and increased epithelial permeability. PAR2 truncation in Caco-2 abrogated fecal protease-mediated permeability. Pouch biopsies obtained from pouchitis patients, but not from NP patients, displayed PAR2 activation.Protease-producing bacteria may increase fecal proteolytic activity that results in pouch inflammation through disruption of TJ proteins and increased epithelial permeability in a PAR2-dependent manner. This mechanism may initiate or propagate pouch inflammation.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Administration of probiotics and prebiotics has been proposed as a convenient and effective treatment. Our study aims to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of  N1115 (N1115) and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) by examining the histopathogenesis and underlying molecular events of NAFLD.An NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding C57BL/6 mice with a high-fat diet (HFD). N1115, FOS and synbiotics were administered for 16 weeks.N1115, FOS and synbiotics alleviated HFD-induced hepatic steato-sis and release of tumor necrosis factor-α, and slowed the progression of cirrhosis. Compared to the HFD group, these dietary supplements reduced serum total triglyceride and cholesterol, and appeared to decrease the fasting blood glucose and insulin. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and real-time PCR showed that the regimens could overcome insulin resistance. These findings were associated with the transcriptional repression of inflammatory factors such as lipopolysaccharides, Toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor-κB. Lastly, N1115, FOS, and synbiotics improved the intestinal barrier functions and histologic integrity. This was accompanied by the restoration of the p38 MAPK pathway and in-creased expression of the  components occludin-1 and claudin-1.N1115, FOS and synbiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.

However, little is understood regarding the underlying mechanism of resistance. The present study aimed to identify the underlying crucial genes and regulatory networks associated with docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer using bioinformatics analyses. For this purpose, one expression profile dataset (GSE33455), which included two docetaxel-sensitive and two docetaxel-resistant cell lines, was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and analyses of differential gene expression and function enrichment were performed. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, and the associated hub genes were investigated using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins and Cytoscape software. A total of 756 differentially expression genes (DEGs) were identified, including 509 downregulated and 247 upregulated genes. Enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs were associated with the interferon-γ-mediated signaling pathway, protein binding, bicellular  and cancer pathways. Two modules were screened from the PPI network, and the corresponding genes were identified to be largely enriched in the interferon-γ-mediated signaling pathway and the negative regulators of the DExD/H-Box helicase 58/interferon induced with helicase C domain 1 signaling pathway, and enriched in cell-cell adhesion and the Rap1 signaling pathway. Among the ten hub genes, epidermal growth factor receptor, spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), interleukin (IL)6, CXC motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8), cyclin dependent kinase 1 and CD44 molecule (CD44) were significantly differentially expressed in prostate cancer tissues compared with healthy tissues based on The Cancer Genome Atlas data. The Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database revealed that ICAM1 was positively associated with IL6 and CXCL8, and epidermal growth factor receptor was positively associated with CD44 and SYK. Additionally, ten hub genes, which were identified to be associated with the drug resistance of docetaxel in prostatic carcinoma in the present study, were predominantly associated with tumor progression and metastasis. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis performed on docetaxel-sensitive and docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell lines demonstrated that certain hub genes, including CDK1, 2'-'-oligoadenylate synthetase 3, CXCL8 and CDH1, were highly expressed in the docetaxel-resistant cell lines, which confirmed the bioinformatics results. In conclusion, the present study identified a number of important genes that are associated with the molecular mechanism of docetaxel resistance by integrated bioinformatical analysis, and these genes and regulatory networks may assist with identifying potential gene therapy targets for CRPC. Further functional analyses are required to validate the current findings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31079318>Development of Human in vitro Brain-blood Barrier Model from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived Endothelial Cells to Predict the in vivo Permeability of Drugs.</a></h1><p>An in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) model is critical for enabling rapid screening of the BBB permeability of the drugs targeting on the central nervous system. Though many models have been developed, their reproducibility and renewability remain a challenge. Furthermore, drug transport data from many of the models do not correlate well with the data for in vivo BBB drug transport. Induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology provides reproducible cell resources for in vitro BBB modeling. Here, we generated a human in vitro BBB model by differentiating the human iPSC (hiPSC) line GM25256 into brain endothelial-type cells. The model displayed BBB characteristics including  proteins (ZO-1, claudin-, and occludin) and endothelial markers (von Willebrand factor and Ulex), as well as high trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) (1560 Ω.cm ± 230 Ω.cm) and γ-GTPase activity. Co-culture with primary rat astrocytes significantly increased the TEER of the model (2970 Ω.cm to 4185 Ω.cm). RNAseq analysis confirmed the expression of key BBB-related genes in the hiPSC-derived endothelial cells in comparison with primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells, including P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP). Drug transport assays for nine CNS compounds showed that the permeability of non-Pgp/BCRP and Pgp/BCRP substrates across the model was strongly correlated with rodent in situ brain perfusion data for these compounds (R = 0.982 and R = 0.9973, respectively), demonstrating the functionality of the drug transporters in the model. Thus, this model may be used to rapidly screen CNS compounds, to predict the in vivo BBB permeability of these compounds and to study the biology of the BBB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132127>Mixed Vehicle Emissions Induces Angiotensin II and Cerebral Microvascular Angiotensin Receptor Expression in C57Bl/6 Mice and Promotes Alterations in Integrity in a Blood-Brain Barrier Coculture Model.</a></h1><p>Exposure to traffic-generated pollution is associated with alterations in blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and exacerbation of cerebrovascular disorders. Angiotensin (Ang) II signaling through the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor is known to promote BBB disruption. We have previously reported that exposure to a mixture of gasoline and diesel vehicle engine emissions (MVE) mediates alterations in cerebral microvasculature of C57Bl/6 mice, which is exacerbated through consumption of a high-fat (HF) diet. Thus, we investigated the hypothesis that inhalation exposure to MVE results in altered central nervous system microvascular integrity mediated by Ang II-AT1 signaling. Three-month-old male C57Bl/6 mice were placed on an HF or low-fat diet and exposed via inhalation to either filtered air (FA) or MVE (100 μg/m3 PM) 6 h/d for 30 days. Exposure to HF+MVE resulted in a significant increase in plasma Ang II and expression of AT1 in the cerebral microvasculature. Results from a BBB coculture study showed that transendothelial electrical resistance was decreased, associated with reduced expression of claudin- and occludin when treated with plasma from MVE+HF animals. These effects were attenuated through pretreatment with the AT1 antagonist, Losartan. Our BBB coculture showed increased levels of astrocyte AT1 and decreased expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor and glutathione peroxidase-1, associated with increased interleukin-6 and transforming growth factor-β in the astrocyte media, when treated with plasma from MVE-exposed groups. Our results indicate that inhalation exposure to traffic-generated pollutants results in altered BBB integrity, mediated through Ang II-AT1 signaling and inflammation, which is exacerbated by an HF diet.© The Author(s) 2019.

The findings from our retrospective study, supported by previous clinical reports, showed that increasing age is an early predictor for developing fatal infectious complications after stroke. However, exactly how and why older individuals are more susceptible to infection after stroke remains unclear. Using a mouse model of transient ischaemic stroke, we demonstrate that older mice (>12 months) present with greater spontaneous bacterial lung infections compared to their younger counterparts (7-10 weeks) after stroke. Importantly, we provide evidence that older poststroke mice exhibited elevated intestinal inflammation and disruption in gut barriers critical in maintaining colonic integrity following stroke, including reduced expression of mucin and  proteins. In addition, our data support the notion that the localized pro-inflammatory microenvironment driven by increased tumour necrosis factor-α production in the colon of older mice facilitates the translocation and dissemination of orally inoculated bacteria to the lung following stroke onset. Therefore, findings of this study demonstrate that exacerbated dysfunction of the intestinal barrier in advanced age promotes translocation of gut-derived bacteria and contributes to the increased risk to poststroke bacterial infection.© 2019 The Authors.

Despite a moratorium on their use, concentrations of PBDEs in the atmosphere and in residential environments remain high due to their persistence. The environmental health risks remain concerning and one of the major adverse effects is neurodevelopmental toxicity. However, the early response and effects of PBDEs exposure on the developing brain remain unknown. In the present study, we investigated the impacts of 2,2',4,4',-pentabrominated diphenyl ether (BDE-99) on vascular growth and vascular barrier function with an emphasis on cerebral blood vessels, in the early life stages, using a zebrafish model. No general toxicity was observed in exposing zebrafish larvae to 0-0. μM BDE-99 at 72 hpf. BDE-99 exposure resulted in neither general toxicity nor pronounced developmental impairment in somatic blood vessels, including intersegmental vessels (ISV) and common cardinal veins (CCV). Meanwhile, both 0.05 μM and 0. μM of BDE-99 reduced cerebrovascular density as well as down-regulation of VEGFA and VEGFR2 in the head. In addition, BDE-99 exposure increased vascular leakage, both in cerebral and truncal vasculature at 72 hpf. The accentuated vascular permeability was observed in the head. The mRNA levels of genes encoding  molecules decreased in the BDE-99-exposed larvae, and more robust reductions in Cldn5, Zo1 and Jam were detected in the head than in the trunk. Moreover, proinflammatory factors including TNF-α, IL-1β and ICAM-1 were induced, and the expression of neurodevelopment-related genes was suppressed in the head following BDE-99 exposure. Taken together, these results reveal that developmental exposure to BDE-99 impedes cerebrovascular growth and disturbs vascular barrier formation. The cerebral vasculature in developing zebrafish, a more sensitive target for BDE-99, may be a promising tool for the assessment of the early neurodevelopmental effects due to PBDEs exposure.Copyright © 2019.

We hypothesized that feed restriction after day  following muscle satellite cell development would allow the full growth of the breast meat. To accomplish this goal, 300 1-day-old ducklings (Maple Leaf Farms Inc.) were randomly allocated to 1 of the 3 groups (n = 4 pens, 25 ducks per pen): (1) Control group fed to ad libitum; (2) 85% daily feed intake from days 1 to 14 (FR 85% 1-14); 85% daily feed intake from days  to 14 (FR 85% -14). All ducks were vaccinated with inactivated Salmonella enteritidis on day 14 and boosted on day 26. The FR 85% -14 did show similar production standards to controls, and improved gait characteristics (P < 0.05). To determine if the partial feed restriction would have an impact on intestinal epithelial  integrity, we treated ducks on days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 with 8.32 mg/kg FITC-d in water per os and blood samples were obtained via the tibial vein 1 h later. Serum samples were analyzed for presence and quantification of FITC-d. Feed restriction elicited a significant increase in FITC-d permeability at all points of evaluation. Anti-S. enteritidis specific IgY responses were assessed by ELISA from serum collected at 14 D, 28 D, and 35 D. Although all ducks showed an increase humoral immune response to the S. enteritidis, both feed restricted groups showed reduced IgY production compared to ad lib controls. Our data suggest that although the FR -14 feed restriction paradigm may reduce gait abnormalities without affecting production rates, some challenges exist due to increased gut leakiness or decreased acquired immune activity. Future studies will look at altering the feed restriction milieu to ameliorate these challenges.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30950142>Dynamic changes to claudins in the uterine epithelial cells of the marsupial Sminthopsis crassicaudata (Dasyuridae) during pregnancy.</a></h1><p>The fluid that surrounds the embryo in the uterus contains important nourishing factors and secretions. To maintain the distinct microenvironment in the uterine lumen, the  between uterine epithelial cells are remodeled to decrease paracellular movement of molecules and solutes. Modifications to  between uterine epithelial cells is a common feature of pregnancy in eutherian mammals, regardless of placental type. Here we used immunofluorescence microscopy and western blot analysis to describe distributional changes to  junctional proteins, claudin-1, -3, -4, and -, in the uterine epithelial cells of a marsupial species, Sminthopsis crassicaudata. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed claudin-1, -3, and - in the  of the uterine epithelium of S. crassicaudata during pregnancy. These specific claudins are associated with restricting passive movement of fluid between epithelial cells in eutherians. Hence, their function during pregnancy in S. crassicaudata may be to maintain the uterine luminal content surrounding developing embryos. Claudin-4 disappears from all uterine regions of S. crassicaudata at the time of implantation, in contrast with the distribution of this claudin in some eutherian mammals. We conclude that like eutherian mammals, distributional changes to claudins in the uterine epithelial cells of S. crassicaudata are necessary to support pregnancy. However, the combination of individual claudin isoforms in the  of the uterine epithelium of S. crassicaudata differs from that of eutherian mammals. Our findings suggest that the precise permeability of the paracellular pathway of the uterine epithelium is species-specific.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31465881>Development of a villi-like micropatterned porous membrane for intestinal magnesium and calcium uptake studies.</a></h1><p>Intestinal enterocytes are key players in the absorption of magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca). Understanding the exact molecular mechanisms by which their absorption behavior is regulated could greatly improve treatment strategies for stimulating intestinal absorption in diseases with Mg and/or Ca deficiency. However, such studies are hampered by the lack of in vitro intestinal cell models mimicking the mechanical and physiological properties of the gut. In this study we develop an in vitro gut model based on porous micropatterned membranes with villi-like surface topography and mechanical properties closely mimicking that of intestinal tissue. These membranes are prepared via phase separation micromolding using poly-ε-caprolactone/poly-lactic-glycolic acid (PCL/PLGA) polymer blend and can facilitate cellular differentiation of Caco-2 cells similar to native enterocytes. In fact, cells cultured on these micropatterned membranes form a brush border of microvilli with spatial differences in morphology and  formation along the villous-base axis. Moreover, cells cultured on our membranes show a 2-fold increased alkaline phosphatase activity at the end of differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate that cells cultured on our micropatterned membranes have a 4- and 1.-fold increased uptake of Mg and Ca, respectively, compared to non-patterned membranes. These results indicate that the new membranes can mimic the intestinal environment and therefore can have a great impact on mineral uptake in vitro. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study presents the development of an in vitro gut model consisting of villi-like PCL/PLGA micropatterned membranes. These membranes are prepared via phase separation micromolding (PSμM), a technique which allows tailoring of the membrane surface topography combined with membrane porosity and interconnectivity which are important parameters for membranes used for in vitro transport studies. The culture of Caco-2 cells on these micropatterned membranes shows that they facilitate cellular differentiation similar to gut enterocytes. Our data indicate that mimicking the 3D geometry of the gut is very important for improving the physiological relevance of in vitro gut models. In the future, our micropatterned membranes with segment-specific geometries, in combination with isotopic measurements, would be applied to perform detailed ion uptake and transport studies.Copyright © 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

Here, we analyzed miRNA expression profiles of Chinese shrimp (Fenneropenaeus chinensis) from control pH (8.2) and low pH (6.)-treated shrimp. Expression analysis identified 6 known miRNAs and 23 novel miRNAs with significantly different expression between control pH 8.2 and low pH 6.; the predicted target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were significantly enriched in organic acid metabolic process, oxidoreductase activity, coenzyme binding, cofactor binding, and collagen trimer. Moreover, target genes were significantly enriched in several Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways including citrate cycle, pyruvate metabolism, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, , carbon metabolism, etc. Our survey expanded the number of known shrimp miRNAs and provided comprehensive information about miRNA response to low pH stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626040>Overexpression of BCL-2 in the Intestinal Epithelium Prevents Sepsis-Induced Gut Barrier Function Via Altering  Protein Expression.</a></h1><p>Sepsis induces both intestinal hyperpermeability and epithelial apoptosis. While each has been implicated in mediating sepsis mortality, the relationship between these two processes is unclear. We hypothesized that preventing intestinal apoptosis would prevent gut barrier dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, transgenic mice that overexpress the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in the gut epithelium (Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice) and wild type (WT) mice were subjected to sham laparotomy or cecal ligation and puncture and orally gavaged with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated-dextran (FD-4) five hours before sacrifice. Serum FD-4 concentration was assayed to measure intestinal permeability, and jejunal  were assayed for mRNA and protein expression. Baseline FD-4 concentration was similar between WT and Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. Intestinal permeability increased 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours following sepsis in WT mice; however, FD-4 concentration was significantly lower at each timepoint in Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. In addition, there were no statistically significant changes in permeability between septic and sham transgenic mice. Intestinal mRNA expression of claudin 3, claudin  and occludin were lower in septic Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice while claudin 4 mRNA levels were higher in Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. In contrast, no differences were detected in claudins 2, 7, 15, JAM-A or ZO-1. Protein levels followed the same trend for all  mediators different between WT and Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice except occludin was significantly higher in transgenic mice. Together these results demonstrate that decreasing intestinal epithelial apoptosis prevents hyperpermeability following sepsis via  alterations which may be at least partially responsible for improved survival conferred by Bcl-2 overexpression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667008>Modelling Macular Edema: The Effect of IL-6 and IL-6R Blockade on Human Blood-Retinal Barrier Integrity In Vitro.</a></h1><p>Macular edema (ME) is a leading cause of visual loss in a range of retinal diseases and despite the use of antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents, its successful treatment remains a major clinical challenge. Based on the indirect clinical evidence that interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key additional candidate mediator of ME, we interrogated the effect of IL-6 on blood-retinal barrier (BRB) integrity in vitro.Human retinal pigment epithelial cell (ARPE-19) and human retinal microvascular endothelial cell (HRMEC) monolayers were used to mimic the outer and inner BRB, respectively. Their paracellular permeability was assessed by measuring the passive permeation of 40 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran across confluent cells in the presence of IL-6. Transendothelial/epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) then was measured and the distribution of the  protein ZO-1 was assessed by immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy.Treatment with IL-6 for 48 hours significantly increased the diffusion rate of FITC-dextran, decreased TEER, and disrupted the distribution of ZO-1 in ARPE-19 cells, which constitutively express the IL-6 transmembrane receptor, and this was reversed with IL-6R blockade. In contrast, IL-6 did not affect the paracellular permeability, TEER, or ZO-1 distribution in HRMECs.These in vitro data support the hypothesis that IL-6 reversibly disrupts the integrity of ARPE-19 cells, but it does not affect HRMECs.IL-6 is a candidate therapeutic target in the treatment of outer BRB driven ME.Copyright 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379610>Pinocembrin Protects Against Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Rats Colitis by Ameliorating Inflammation, Improving Barrier Function and Modulating Gut Microbiota.</a></h1><p>Pinocembrin (PIN) is a natural flavonoid widely found in bee propolis with potent gastrointestinal protective effects. In consequence, PIN has great potential in preventing inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) while scant information is available. In this study, a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced rats ulcerative colitis model (3.% DSS in drinking water for 7 days) was applied to explore the protective effects of PIN on macroscopic colitis symptoms, inflammation, intestinal epithelial barrier function, and gut microbiota homeostasis. While DSS-treated rats showed severe colitis clinical symptoms and histological changes (colonic pathological damages and intestinal goblet cells loss), pre-administration of PIN ( and 10 mg/kg, ) for a week alleviated these symptoms. Pre-administration of PIN also suppressed the pro-inflammatory gene expressions and improved  functions of colonic epithelial cells. Additionally, PIN administration reversed DSS-induced short chain fatty acid loss, and improved the gut microbial diversity assessed by 16S rRNA phylogenetic sequencing. Overall, our results suggest a wide spectrum of protective effects of PIN in preventing IBDs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288831>Glibenclamide in aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (GASH): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.</a></h1><p>Recent findings on the benefits of glibenclamide as a neuroprotective drug have started a new era for prospective studies on sulfonylureas. The effect of glibenclamide blocking the Sur1-Trpm4 channel was examined in models of subarachnoid hemorrhage and stroke, with findings of significantly reduced  abnormalities, resulting in less edema formation and considerably reduced transsynaptic apoptosis of hippocampal neurons and significantly ameliorated impairments in spatial learning. Based on these data, we plan a clinical trial to establish evidence of glibenclamide as an adjunct treatment in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.An estimated 80 patients meeting the inclusion criteria of radiological confirmatory evidence of an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, age 18-70 years, and presentation of less than 96 h from the ictus will be allocated randomly into two groups, one receiving  mg daily oral intake of glibenclamide for 21 days and another control group receiving a placebo. The study's primary outcome is the modified Rankin scale (mRS) after 6 months, as favorable (mRS 0-2) or unfavorable (mRS 3-6). The secondary outcomes will be late cognitive status, assessed after 6 months by psychological tests (the Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment), as well as death at 6 months, delayed cerebral ischemia and occurrence of serious adverse events due to study medication.There is a growing interest in the scientific community regarding glibenclamide in brain edema and traumatic brain injury, but with very little of this interest targeting spontaneous brain hemorrhage, especially aneurism rupture. Positive outcomes are expected for the treatment patients, especially in language and memory preservation, as has been shown in experimental models.ClinicalTrials.gov,  .

Glial cells, T-cells, and mast cells perform specific protective functions in different regions of the brain for the recovery of cognitive and motor functions after central nervous system (CNS) injuries including TBI. Chronic neuroinflammatory responses resulting in neuronal death and the accompanying stress following brain injury predisposes or accelerates the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in high-risk individuals. About .7 million Americans are currently living with AD. Immediately following brain injury, mast cells respond by releasing prestored and preactivated mediators and recruit immune cells to the CNS. Blood-brain barrier (BBB),  and adherens  proteins, neurovascular and gliovascular microstructural rearrangements, and dysfunction associated with increased trafficking of inflammatory mediators and inflammatory cells from the periphery across the BBB leads to increase in the chronic neuroinflammatory reactions following brain injury. In this review, we advance the hypothesis that neuroinflammatory responses resulting from mast cell activation along with the accompanying risk factors such as age, gender, food habits, emotional status, stress, allergic tendency, chronic inflammatory diseases, and certain drugs can accelerate brain injury-associated neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and AD pathogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31258635>Scutellarin-treated exosomes increase claudin , occludin and ZO1 expression in rat brain microvascular endothelial cells.</a></h1><p>Homocysteine has been reported to be an independent risk factor for stroke. Scutellarin (Scu) dilates cerebral blood vessels and promotes anti-platelet aggregation; however, the mechanism by which Scu and Scu-treated exosomes protect against cerebrovascular disease is unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying the effects of Scu and Scu-treated exosomes on  proteins in the blood-brain barrier. Rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (RBMVECs) were cultured and divided into five groups: Control, model, Scu, exosomes derived from RBMVECs and exosomes derived from RBMVECs after Scu administration. MTT, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and nitric oxide (NO) assays were performed to assess cell viability and injury. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected using spectrophotometry and immunofluorescence. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were performed to measure cluster of differentiation (CD) 63, claudin , occludin and  protein 1 (ZO1) expression. The results revealed that treatment with Scu and Scu-treated exosomes enhanced cell viability, reduced cell injury, increased NO levels, upregulated CD63, claudin , occludin and ZO1, and decreased LDH and ROS levels. These data suggest that Scu and Scu-treated exosomes protect homocysteine-induced RBMVECs via increased claudin , occludin and ZO1 expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30977661>Organic Anion-Transporting Polypeptide 1a4 (Oatp1a4/Slco1a4) at the Blood-Arachnoid Barrier is the Major Pathway of Sulforhodamine-101 Clearance from Cerebrospinal Fluid of Rats.</a></h1><p>The blood-arachnoid barrier (BAB), which is formed by arachnoid epithelial cells linked by , has generally been considered impermeable to water-soluble substances. However, we recently demonstrated that organic anion transporters 1 and 3 (Oat1 and Oat3) play roles in drug clearance at the BAB. Here, we examined whether an organic anion-transporting polypeptide (Oatp) also plays a role, using the fluorescent organic anion sulforhodamine-101 (SR-101) as a model substrate. SR-101 was injected into the cisterna magna of rats in order to minimize the contribution of choroid plexus transport. The in vivo cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) elimination clearance of SR-101 after intracisternal administration was ninefold greater than that of fluorescein-labeled inulin, a bulk flow marker. In the case of pre-administration of taurocholate, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of Oatps, or digoxin, a strong substrate/inhibitor for Oatp1a4 but not for Oatp1a1, Oat1, and Oat3, the CSF elimination of SR-101 was significantly reduced, becoming similar to that of inulin, and thus indicating complete inhibition of SR-101 clearance from the CSF. The distribution of SR-101 fluorescence was restricted to the arachnoid mater in the absence of inhibitor, whereas the fluorescence was increased in the parenchyma of the spinal cord after co-injection of taurocholate or digoxin. Immunostaining confirmed the localization of Oatp1a4 in the arachnoid mater. These results indicate that Oatp1a4 at the BAB acts as an avid clearance pathway of SR-101 in the CSF to the blood. Thus, Oatp1a4 appears to play a major role in CSF detoxification by limiting the distribution of organic anions to the brain and spinal cord.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31106911>Effects of methionine partially replaced by methionyl-methionine dipeptide on intestinal function in methionine-deficient pregnant mice.</a></h1><p>This study was to compare the effects of parenteral supplementation of methionyl-methionine (Met-Met) or Met on intestinal barrier function in Met-deficient pregnant mice. Pregnant mice were randomly divided into three groups. The Control group was provided a diet containing Met and received i.p. injection of saline. The Met group was fed the same diet but without Met and received daily i.p. injection of 35% of the Met contained in the control diet. The Met-Met group was treated the same as the Met group, except that 25% of the Met injected was replaced with Met-Met. Met-Met promoted villus surface area in ileum compared with Met alone. In addition, the mRNA abundance of amino acid and glucose transporters in the small intestine was altered with Met-Met. Moreover, Met-Met increased  protein and decreased apoptosis-related proteins expression in the jejunum and ileum. These results suggest that Met-Met can promote intestinal function over Met alone in Met-deficient mice.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614141>Trans-10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid alleviates LPS-induced blood-brain barrier dysfunction by activating the AMPK/PI3K/AKT pathway.</a></h1><p>We previously reported that trans-10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10-HDA), the exclusive lipid component of royal jelly (RJ), alleviates Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation both in vivo and in vitro. However, whether 10-HDA can protect against LPS-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage is largely unexplored. In this study, we first observed that 10-HDA decreased BBB permeability in LPS-stimulated C57BL/6 mice by Evan's blue (EB) dye. Immunostaining and Western blot results showed that 10-HDA alleviated BBB dysfunction by inhibiting the degradation of  proteins (occludin, claudin- and ZO-1). In LPS-stimulated human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), 10-HDA decreased the expression of chemokines (CCL-2 and CCL-3), adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1), reactive oxygen species, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and increased the expression of  proteins. Interestingly, LC-MS/MS analysis showed that 10-HDA pretreatment upregulated the expression of mitochondria-associated proteins, which may reflect the mechanism underlying the regulatory effect of 10-HDA on reactive oxygen species. We further illustrated that 10-HDA promoted the activation of the AMPK pathway and the downstream PI3K/AKT pathway. Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) and LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) markedly reversed the alleviating effect of 10-HDA on the expression of  proteins, indicating that 10-HDA inhibited LPS-induced BBB dysfunction by triggering the activation of the AMPK/PI3K/AKT pathway. Collectively, these data reveal that 10-HDA may be an interesting candidate for clinical evaluation in the treatment of diseases related to BBB damage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Sprague‑Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: Sham‑operated group, ANP group (3.% sodium taurocholate solution, 1 ml/kg body weight), dithizone group (100 mg/kg of body weight) and ANP + dithizone group (sodium taurocholate solution was administered 6 h after dithizone injection). Each group was further divided into five subgroups (6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h) based on the time period between induction of the model and sample collection. The present results suggested the number of Paneth cells was gradually decreased in the ANP group in a time‑dependent manner. Most of the Paneth cells were ablated in the ANP + dithizone group at 6 h, but a subset of Paneth cells recovered after 24‑48 h. Compared with the ANP group, combination of dithizone and ANP significantly induced more severe histopathological injuries in the pancreas and distal ileum, with higher Schmidt and Chiu's scores, respectively. Additionally, increased expression levels of tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α), interleukin (IL)‑1β and IL‑17A were detected in the ileum, causing an increase in intestinal permeability, as assessed by a decrease in the expression level of the intestinal  protein occludin and high plasma levels of diamine oxidase and D‑lactate. The increase in intestinal permeability led to the translocation of bacteria to the bloodstream, triggering systemic inflammation, as assessed by the increased plasma levels of TNF‑α, IL‑1β and IL‑17A, reducing the survival rates of rats, which was 66.7% and 83.3% in the ANP + dithizone and the ANP group, respectively. The increase in intestinal endoplasmic reticulum stress, as assessed by high expression levels of binding‑immunoglobulin protein and activating transcription factor 6, may be one mechanism associated with Paneth cells loss and intestinal barrier impairment during ANP. Collectively, the present study suggested that the absence of Paneth cells may be an important factor involved in intestinal injury, promoting the progression of ANP.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31476608>Fish oil supplementation to a high-fat diet improves both intestinal health and the systemic obese phenotype.</a></h1><p>Impaired intestinal health characterized by a dysbiotic microbial community and a dysfunctional epithelial barrier contributes to host inflammation and metabolic dysfunction in obesity. Fish oil (FO)-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to improve aspects of the obese phenotype; however, their effect on obese intestinal health is unknown. This study aimed to determine the effect of dietary FO on the intestinal microenvironment, including the microbial community and epithelial barrier, in a mouse model of high-fat diet induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed (12 weeks) either a high-fat diet (HF, 60% fat as kcal) or an isocaloric HF supplemented with Menhaden FO (.3% kcal, HF + FO). 16S rRNA sequencing was used to determine changes in fecal microbiota. Intestinal (ileum and colon) and epididymal adipose tissue RNA was used to assess biomarkers of barrier integrity and inflammatory status, respectively. Serum was used to assess adipokine concentrations and insulin resistance. HF + FO diet altered the fecal microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Firmicutes and increasing the abundance of members of the Bacteroidetes phyla, as well as increasing the abundance of antiobesogenic Akkermansia muciniphila, compared to HF. Intestinal epithelial barrier functions were improved by HF + FO evidenced by increased mRNA expression of  components, antimicrobial defenses and mucus barrier components. HF + FO-fed mice exhibited improvements in homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, oral glucose tolerance and serum adipokine concentrations and epididymal mRNA expression (increased adiponectin and decreased leptin) versus HF. HF + FO improved obese intestinal health and attenuated metabolic dysfunction associated with obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This work tried to elucidate whether GLP-1, GLP-2 and EGF can affect the EB of the rumen. Ovine ruminal epithelia were incubated in Ussing chambers for 7 hr with 25 or 250 nM of either GLP-1 or GLP-2 on the serosal side, with 2. nM of EGF on the serosal side or with 0.25 or 2. nM EGF on the mucosal side. No treatment affected tissue conductance. Short-circuit current (I ) was affected by time and treatment and their interactions. Only 250 nM of either GLP-1 or GLP-2 decreased I in certain periods compared with 25 nM GLP-1 or 0.25 nM mucosally applied EGF; however, not when compared to control epithelia. Fluorescein flux rates (J ) of ruminal epithelia were affected by treatment, time and time × treatment interaction. The time × treatment interaction was based on an increase in J between the first and last hour in epithelia incubated with 25 nM GLP-1 or GLP-2 and in epithelia incubated with EGF. After 7 hr incubation, claudin-7 mRNA expression was downregulated in all treatments. Claudin-1 mRNA was upregulated after incubation with 2. nM EGF on the serosal side, claudin-4 mRNA was downregulated by 2. nM EGF on the mucosal side, and occludin mRNA was increased after incubation with 250 nM GLP-2. The protein abundance of all tested TJ proteins was not influenced by treatment. We conclude that GLP-1, GLP-2, and EGF have no obvious acute effects on the EB of ruminal epithelia under simulated physiological conditions ex vivo. However, by decreasing the mRNA expression of claudin-7 and partly affecting other TJ proteins, they may modulate EB in the longer term or under certain conditions.© 2019 The Authors.

We postulate that the  protein claudin-19 is expressed in IMCD and that it takes part in epithelial adaptation to changing osmolality at different functional states. Presence of claudin-19 in rat IMCD was investigated by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Primary cell culture of rat IMCD cells on permeable filter supports was performed under different osmotic culture conditions and after stimulation by antidiuretic hormone (AVP). Electrogenic transepithelial transport properties were measured in Ussing chambers. IMCD cells cultivated at 300 mosm/kg showed high transepithelial resistance, a cation selective paracellular pathway and claudin-19 was mainly located in the . Treatment by AVP increased cation selectivity but did not alter transepithelial resistance or claudin-19 subcellular localization. In contrast, IMCD cells cultivated at 900 mosm/kg had low transepithelial resistance, anion selectivity, and claudin-19 was relocated from the  to intracellular vesicles.

The current study aimed to investigate the efficacy of supplementing a novel specific low-methoxyl pectin (LMP) dietary fiber in preventing T1D development. Female NOD mice were weaned onto control or % (wt/wt) LMP supplemented diets for up to 40 weeks of age, overt diabetes incidence and blood glucose were monitored. Then broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABX) treatment per os for 7 days followed by gut microbiota transfer was performed to demonstrate gut microbiota-dependent effects. Next-generation sequencing was used for analyzing the composition of microbiota in caecum. Concentration of short chain fatty acids were determined by GC-MS. The barrier reinforcing  proteins zonula occludens-2 (ZO-2), claudin-1 and NOD like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation were determined by Western blot. The proportion of CD25Foxp3CD4 regulatory T cell (Foxp3 Treg) in the pancreas, pancreatic and mesenteric lymph nodes was analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that LMP supplementation ameliorated T1D development in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, as evidenced by decreasing diabetes incidence and fasting glucose levels in LMP fed NOD mice. Further microbiota analysis revealed that LMP supplementation prevented T1D-associated caecal dysbiosis and selectively enriched caecal bacterial species to produce more SCFAs. The LMP-mediated microbial balance further enhanced caecal barrier function and shaped gut-pancreatic immune environment, as characterized by higher expression of  proteins claudin-1, ZO-2 in caecum, increased Foxp3 Treg population and decreased NLRP3 inflammasome activation in both caecum and pancreas. The microbiota-dependent beneficial effect of LMP on T1D was further proven by the fact that aberration of caecal microbiota by ABX treatment worsened T1D autoimmunity and could be restored with transfer of feces of LMP-fed NOD mice. These data demonstrate that this novel LMP limits T1D development by inducing caecal homeostasis to shape pancreatic immune environment. This finding opens a realistic option for gut microbiota manipulation and prevention of T1D in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075901>P2X7 Receptor Indirectly Regulates the JAM-A Protein Content via Modulation of GSK-3β.</a></h1><p>The alveolar epithelial cells represent an important part of the alveolar barrier, which is maintained by  proteins, particularly JAM-A, occludin, and claudin-18, which regulate paracellular permeability. In this study, we report on a strong increase in epithelial JAM-A expression in P2X7 receptor knockout mice when compared to the wildtype. Precision-cut lung slices of wildtype and knockout lungs and immortal epithelial lung E10 cells were treated with bleomycin, the P2X7 receptor inhibitor oxATP, and the agonist BzATP, respectively, to evaluate early changes in JAM-A expression. Biochemical and immunohistochemical data showed evidence for P2X7 receptor-dependent JAM-A expression in vitro. Inhibition of the P2X7 receptor using oxATP increased JAM-A, whereas activation of the receptor decreased the JAM-A protein level. In order to examine the role of GSK-3β in the expression of JAM-A in alveolar epithelial cells, we used lithium chloride for GSK-3β inhibiting experiments, which showed a modulating effect on bleomycin-induced alterations in JAM-A levels. Our data suggest that an increased constitutive JAM-A protein level in P2X7 receptor knockout mice may have a protective effect against bleomycin-induced lung injury. Bleomycin-treated precision-cut lung slices from P2X7 receptor knockout mice responded with a lower increase in mRNA expression of JAM-A than bleomycin-treated precision-cut lung slices from wildtype mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30977499>Dietary l-tryptophan alleviated LPS-induced intestinal barrier injury by regulating  in a Caco-2 cell monolayer model.</a></h1><p>The intestinal epithelial layer forms a barrier through cell-cell  and breaking or even slightly disrupting this barrier can lead to serious pathological consequences, including infection and inflammation. Various amino acids have been shown to improve the intestinal tract, but the effect of tryptophan on the intestinal barrier has been controversial. Here, an in vitro Caco-2 cell model was built to investigate the protective and reparative effects of different concentrations of dietary l-Tryptophan (l-Trp) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intestinal  injury. Lower concentrations (40 μM) of dietary l-Trp protected and repaired the integrity and permeability injury of the intestinal  induced by LPS, while high concentrations (80 μM) may not have a positive effect. LPS-induced injury led to increased (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of Nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) and Myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), and decreased (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Mitogen-activated protein (MAP), and the treatment of dietary l-Trp alleviated those regulations in different concentrations, which suggests that dietary l-Trp may attenuate LPS-induced injury to  via inhibiting the NFκB-MLCK signaling pathway and activating the ERK1/2-MAP signaling pathway. And the mRNA and protein expressions of claudin-1, occludin and ZO-1 in LPS-induced injury were all down-regulated to varying degrees, and dietary l-Trp weakened the down-regulation of claudin-1 (P < 0.05) with no significant regulation of the protein expression of occludin and ZO-1 (P > 0.05).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31165051>Development of a Novel  Nasal Epithelial Cell Model Supporting Colonization With Human Nasal Microbiota.</a></h1><p>The nasal mucosa provides first line defense against inhaled pathogens while creating a unique microenvironment for bacterial communities. Studying the impact of microbiota in the nasal cavity has been difficult due to limitations with current models including explant cultures, primary cells, or neoplastic cell lines. Most notably, none have been shown to support reproducible colonization by bacterial communities from human donors. Therefore, to conduct controlled studies of the human nasal ecosystem, we have developed a novel  mucosal model that supports bacterial colonization of a cultured host mucosa created by immortalized human nasal epithelial cells (NEC). For this model, immortalized NEC established from  male and  female donors were cultured with an air-interfaced, apical surface on a porous transwell membrane. NEC were grown from nasal turbinate tissues harvested from willed bodies or from discarded tissue collected during sinonasal procedures. Immortalized cells were evaluated through molecular verification of cell type, histological confirmation of tissue differentiation including formation of , NEC multilayer viability, metabolism, physiology and imaging of the luminal surface by scanning electron microscopy. Results showed proper differentiation and multilayer formation at seven to 10 days after air interface that was maintained for up to 3 weeks. The optimized mucosal cultures created an environment necessary to sustain colonization by nasal microbiomes (NMBs) that were collected from healthy volunteers, cryogenically preserved and characterized with customized quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) arrays. Polymicrobial communities of nasal bacteria associated with healthy and inflamed states were consistently reproduced in matured NEC co-cultures by transplant of NMBs from multiple community types.

After hypoxia culture of A549 cells for 0., 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h (normal oxygen culture at the same time point was set as the control group), the mass concentration of HIF-1α in A549 lung cancer cell culture medium were determined by ELISA. Transwell chamber was used to construct an  blood brain barrier model, was treated with A549 lung cancer cell culture medium after different time points of hypoxia, Tran endothelial resistance (TER) change of blood-brain barrier model in instrument, to reflect the changes of blood-brain barrier permeability ; A549 lung cancer cells in the culture medium were counted under Transwell room. A549 lung cancer cells with hypoxia at different time points injected into Wistar rats via tail vein, Western blot method was used to menstruate expression of  associated protein Claudin- in the brain tissues, Evans blue to detect the change of blood brain barrier permeability in rats.Compared with the control group, the HIF-1α mass concentration in the cell culture solution of A549 increased, the  blood-brain barrier model TER decreased, and the cell number of A549 that passed through transwell into the lower chamber increased (all <0.05) after hypoxia 2 h, the above effect was most obvious when hypoxia 8 h (all <0.01). After hypoxia 24 h, it was restored to the control group level. In the  experiment of rats, compared with the control group, the mass percent of Evans blue in rat brain tissues increased after A549 cell culture solution with hypoxia 2 h was injected via caudal vein, meaning increased the permeability of rat blood brain barrier, while the expression of Claudin- protein in rat brain tissues decreased (all <0.05). The effect was most obvious when A549 cell culture solution with hypoxia 8 h was injected into rat tail vein (<0.01 ). Ejectionof hypoxia 24 h A549 cell culture solution yielded the same effects as those in the control group.Hypoxia can induce the increase of HIF-1α in lung cancer cells. The increase of HIF-1α results in the decrease of Claudin- expression and increase of blood-brain barrier permeability, leading to lung cancer cells metastasis into the brain.Copyright© by Editorial Board of Journal of Sichuan University (Medical Science Edition).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31346356>A Protective Role of the NRF2-Keap1 Pathway in Maintaining Intestinal Barrier Function.</a></h1><p>Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) is a master regulator of cellular oxidative levels against environmental stresses. Nrf2 induces the expression of metabolic detoxification and antioxidant enzymes to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS). The gastrointestinal tract is a key source of ROS. Intestinal barrier is critical to maintain the healthy steady state of the human gastrointestinal tract. Nrf2 has been shown to play important roles in maintaining the integrity of intestinal mucosal barrier. Here, we made a systematic review on the roles of Nrf2 in maintaining intestinal barrier, including the following: (1) NRF2 reduced intestinal mucosal injury by suppressing oxidative stress; (2) NRF2 decreased intestinal inflammation by inhibiting the inflammatory pathway; (3) NRF2 affected intestinal  proteins and apoptosis of cells to regulate intestinal permeability; (4) NRF2 affected T cell differentiation and functions; () the crossregulation between the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway and autophagy controlled intestinal oxidative stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298370>Long noncoding RNA LSINCT5 is upregulated and promotes the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Long stress-induced noncoding transcripts  (LSI) has been reported to be upregulated in several human cancers and related to poor prognosis. However, its involvement in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains largely unknown. We aim to evaluate the expression and putative role of LSI on the progression of ESCC.LSI expression was first examined in the ESCC cell lines using RT-qPCR, and the next-generation RNA-Seq technology was employed to analyze and functionally annotate the differential gene expression before and after LSI knockdown in ESCC was made. Based on the functional annotation results, the effects of LSI knockdown on cell growth, migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were assessed in the ESCC cell lines. Finally, the expression and clinicopathological significance of LSI in ESCC and corresponding nontumor tissues were further explored using RT-qPCR.The RT-qPCR results showed that LSI expression was significantly upregulated in the ESCC cell lines. The differential gene expression analysis by next-generation RNA-Seq showed that 138 genes were up-regulated, and 227 genes were downregulated after LSI was knocked down in the ECA 109 cells. In addition, the functional annotation revealed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly functionally involved in , ECM-receptor interactions, and MAPK signaling pathway. Further in vitro studies indicated that the knockdown of LSI significantly suppressed proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT in ESCC cells. Finally, a comparative study of paired ESCC and corresponding nontumor tissues showed that LSI was upregulated in the ESCC tissues, and the increased LSI expression was related to late clinical stages, large tumor sizes, and lymph node metastasis.The results indicate that LSI is upregulated in ESCC and may act as an oncogene promoting the progression of ESCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31047972>Blood-brain barrier dysfunction underlying Alzheimer's disease is induced by an SSAO/VAP-1-dependent cerebrovascular activation with enhanced Aβ deposition.</a></h1><p>Dysfunctions of the vascular system directly contribute to the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The blood-brain barrier (BBB) shows signs of malfunction at early stages of the disease. When Abeta peptide (Aβ) is deposited on brain vessels, it induces vascular degeneration by producing reactive oxygen species and promoting inflammation. These molecular processes are also related to an excessive SSAO/VAP-1 (semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase) enzymatic activity, observed in plasma and in cerebrovascular tissue of AD patients. We studied the contribution of vascular SSAO/VAP-1 to the BBB dysfunction in AD using in vitro BBB models. Our results show that SSAO/VAP-1 expression is associated to endothelial activation by altering the release of pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic angioneurins, most highly IL-6, IL-8 and VEGF. It is also related to a BBB structure alteration, with a decrease in  proteins such as zona occludens or claudin-. Moreover, the BBB function reveals increased permeability and leukocyte adhesion in cells expressing SSAO/VAP-1, as well as an enhancement of the vascular Aβ deposition induced by mechanisms both dependent and independent of the enzymatic activity of SSAO/VAP-1. These results reveal an interesting role of vascular SSAO/VAP-1 in BBB dysfunction related to AD progression, opening a new window in the search of alternative therapeutic targets for fighting AD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The calculated adhesion energies, varying from  -.048 eV (r-GO|TiO), -12.159 eV (r-GO|TiO), -18.499 eV (r-GO|TiO) to  -42.484 eV (r-GO|TiO), indicate high stability of these composites. It was shown that electronic interactions at the r-GO|(1 1 0)TiO interface give rise to net charge flow from the r-GO substrate towards the TiO moieties, analyzed in terms of the partial charge density 3D plots and an interfacial dipole moment formation. The DOS structure of the composites was calculated by means of the time dependent DFTB approach, and the position and composition of the VB and CB edges, along with the presence of weak mid-gap 2p  C states originating from the intact graphene-like patches in the r-GO substrate were discussed in detail in the context of conceivable photocatalytic activity of the composites. The constructed band alignment diagram implies formation of the staggered type II scheme, with the electric field offset that is sensitive to the titania cluster size. In the case of the nano-reticular TiO, where only a fraction of the Ti atoms is engaged in the Ti-O-C linkers formation, recombination of the photogenerated charges is inhibited owing to favorable spatial separation effect. For small molecular TiO clusters with all Ti cations anchored to the r-GO layer fast cross-relaxation quenches the beneficial interfacial charge separation effect, since the strong hybridization of the oxygen and carbon states provides a convenient pathway for the efficient electronic coupling between the CB edge states of r-GO and the VB edge states of the TiO moieties. A phenomenological model of the molecular r-GO|TiO and the reticular r-GO|TiO composites was constructed in account for different photocatalytic behavior of both .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569528>Syncytiotrophoblast of Placentae from Women with Zika Virus Infection Has Altered  Protein Expression and Increased Paracellular Permeability.</a></h1><p>The cytotrophoblast of human placenta transitions into an outer multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast (STB) layer that covers chorionic villi which are in contact with maternal blood in the intervillous space. During pregnancy, the Zika virus (ZIKV) poses a serious prenatal threat. STB cells are resistant to ZIKV infections, yet placental cells within the mesenchyme of chorionic villi are targets of ZIKV infection. We seek to determine whether ZIKV can open the paracellular pathway of STB cells. This route is regulated by  (TJs) which are present in the uppermost portion of the lateral membranes of STB cells. We analyzed the paracellular permeability and expression of E-cadherin, occludin, JAMs -B and -C, claudins -1, -3, -4, - and -7, and ZO-1, and ZO-2 in the STB of placentae from ZIKV-infected and non-infected women. In ZIKV-infected placentae, the pattern of expression of TJ proteins was preserved, but the amount of claudin-4 diminished. Placentae from ZIKV-infected women were permeable to ruthenium red, and had chorionic villi with a higher mean diameter and Hofbauer hyperplasia. Finally, ZIKV added to the basolateral surface of a trophoblast cell line reduced the transepithelial electrical resistance.

The glucocorticoid Dexamethasone is an important pharmaceutical for the treatment of colitis and other inflammatory bowel diseases. While suppressive effects of glucocorticoids on activated immune cells is significant, their effects upon epithelial cells are less well studied. Previous research shows that the effects of Dexamethasone treatment on polarized Caco-2 cell layer permeability is delayed for >10 treatment days (as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance).  intestinal epithelial cells turn over every 3- days; we therefore hypothesized that culture age may produce marked effects on gene expression, potentially acting as a confounding variable. To investigate this issue, we cultured polarized Caco-2 monolayers during a 30-day timecourse with ~15 days of continuous Dexamethasone exposure. We collected samples during the timecourse and tested differential expression using a 250-plex gene expression panel and Nanostring nCounter® system. Our custom panel was selectively enriched for KEGG annotations for , actin cytoskeleton regulation, and colorectal cancer-associated genes, allowing for focused gene ontology-based pathway enrichment analyses. To test for confounding effects of time and Dexamethasone variables, we used the Nanostring nSolver differential expression data model which includes a mixturenegative binomial modelwith optimization. We identified a time-associated "EMT-like" signature with differential expression seen in important actomyosin cytoskeleton, , integrin, and cell cycle pathway genes. Dexamethasone treatment resulted in a subtle yet significant counter-signal showing suppression of actomyosin genes and differential expression of various growth factor receptors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340691> Impairs Oral Epithelial Barrier through Targeting GRHL2.</a></h1><p>Oral mucosa provides the first line of defense against a diverse array of environmental and microbial irritants by forming the barrier of epithelial cells interconnected by multiprotein  (TJ), adherens , desmosomes, and gap  complexes. Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2), an epithelial-specific transcription factor, may play a role in the formation of the mucosal epithelial barrier, as it regulates the expression of the  proteins. The current study investigated the role of GRHL2 in the  ()-induced impairment of epithelial barrier functions. Exposure of human oral keratinocytes (HOK-16B and OKF6 cells) to  or derived lipopolysaccharides ( LPSs) led to rapid loss of endogenous GRHL2 and the  proteins (e.g., zonula occludens, E-cadherin, claudins, and occludin). GRHL2 directly regulated the expression levels of the  proteins and the epithelial permeability for small molecules (e.g., dextrans and  bacteria). To explore the functional role of GRHL2 in oral mucosal barrier, we used a  conditional knockout (KO) mouse model, which allows for epithelial tissue-specific  KO in an inducible manner.  KO impaired the expression of the  proteins at the junctional epithelium and increased the alveolar bone loss in the ligature-induced periodontitis model. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed increased epithelial penetration of oral bacteria in  KO mice compared with the wild-type mice. Also, blood loadings of oral bacteria (e.g., , β-, and ) were significantly elevated in  KO mice compared to the wild-type littermates. These data indicate that  bacteria may enhance paracellular penetration through oral mucosa in part by targeting the expression of GRHL2 in the oral epithelial cells, which then impairs the epithelial barrier by inhibition of  protein expression, resulting in increased alveolar tissue destruction and systemic bacteremia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31064006>A blend of fatty acids, organic acids, and phytochemicals induced changes in intestinal morphology and inflammatory gene expression in coccidiosis-vaccinated broiler chickens.</a></h1><p>Feed additives that promote gastrointestinal health may complement coccidiosis vaccination programs in antibiotic-free broiler production systems. This study examined the effects of a commercial feed additive blend (FA) on intestinal histomorphology and inflammatory biomarkers in vaccinated Ross 708 cockerels (N = 2,160). The study was a randomized complete block design (12 blocks) with 3 dietary treatments: CON (negative control), AGP (positive control: 55 ppm of bacitracin methylene disalicylate), and FA (1. kg/MT in starter; 1.0 kg/MT in grower; and 0. kg/MT in finisher). Birds were reared on re-used litter and fed a 3-phase feeding program (starter, 0 to 14 D; grower, 15 to 28 D; finisher, 29 to 36 D). One master batch of basal feed for each feeding phase was prepared and final experimental diets were manufactured by mixing the basal feed with the respective test ingredient prior to pelleting. Growth measurements, including pen body weight and feed intakes, and fresh fecal samples were taken throughout the study. On day 20, samples of intestinal tissue were collected from a subset of birds (n = 72, 1 block) for histomorphology and mRNA expression of  and inflammatory genes. In the duodenum, the ratio of villi length to crypt depth was significantly lower in FA (and AGP) fed birds than those consuming the CON diet. Relative mRNA expressions of iNOS, IFNƔ, and claudin-1 were upregulated in the jejunum of FA and AGP treatment groups compared to those in the CON group; the response in the FA was of lesser magnitude than AGP. Together, these results demonstrated that the FA treatment altered the microstructure of the duodenum and affected the expression of inflammatory genes in the jejunum. The timing of these changes coincided with peak oocyte shedding in feces and an observed reduction in feed efficiency in all dietary treatment groups.© The Author(s) 2019.

Acetylcholine and nicotine stimulate mucus production and suppress Th2 inflammation through nicotinic receptors in lungs but UC is rarely observed in smokers and the mechanism of the protection is unclear.In order to evaluate whether acetylcholine can ameliorate UC-associated pathologies, we employed a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC-like conditions, and a group of mice were treated with Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) to increase acetylcholine availability. The effects on colonic tissue morphology, Th2 inflammatory factors, MUC2 mucin, and gut microbiota were analyzed.DSS challenge damaged the murine colonic architecture, reduced the MUC2 mucin and the  protein ZO-1. The PB treatment significantly attenuated these DSS-induced responses along with the eosinophilic infiltration and the pro-Th2 inflammatory factors. Moreover, PB inhibited the DSS-induced loss of commensal Clostridia and Flavobacteria, and the gain of pathogenic Erysipelotrichia and Fusobacteria.Together, these data suggest that in colons of a murine model, PB promotes MUC2 synthesis, suppresses Th2 inflammation and attenuates bacterial dysbiosis therefore, PB has a therapeutic potential in UC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391341>Dysregulated claudin- cycling in the inner retina causes retinal pigment epithelial cell atrophy.</a></h1><p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of central retinal vision loss worldwide, with an estimated 1 in 10 people over the age of 55 showing early signs of the condition. There are currently no forms of therapy available for the end stage of dry AMD, geographic atrophy (GA). Here, we show that the inner blood-retina barrier (iBRB) is highly dynamic and may play a contributory role in GA development. We have discovered that the gene CLDN5, which encodes claudin-, a  protein abundantly expressed at the iBRB, is regulated by BMAL1 and the circadian clock. Persistent suppression of claudin- expression in mice exposed to a cholesterol-enriched diet induced striking retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell atrophy, and persistent targeted suppression of claudin- in the macular region of nonhuman primates induced RPE cell atrophy. Moreover, fundus fluorescein angiography in human and nonhuman primate subjects showed increased retinal vascular permeability in the evening compared with the morning. These findings implicate an inner retina-derived component in the early pathophysiological changes observed in AMD, and we suggest that restoring the integrity of the iBRB may represent a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of GA secondary to dry AMD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428467>Increasing Donor Endothelial Cell Pool by Culturing Cells from Discarded Pieces of Human Donor Corneas for Regenerative Treatments.</a></h1><p>To investigate if the peripheral corneal endothelium that is usually discarded after a corneal transplant could be used for endothelial cell culture.Donor corneas ( = 19) with a mean age of 72 years, male : female ratio of 15 : 4, and death-to-preservation time of 10 hours were assessed for endothelial cell density (ECD) and number of dead cells before isolation. Alizarin red staining ( = 3) was performed to check the morphology of cells in the center and periphery. Descemet's membrane-endothelial complex was peeled from the center (8.25 mm) and the periphery (2.75 mm) and plated in two different wells of an 8-well chamber slide with media refreshed every alternate day. The confluence rate was monitored by microscopy. Live/dead analysis was performed ( = 3) at confluence. Tag-2A12 as a monoclonal antibody against peroxiredoxin-6 (Prdx-6) ( = 4), ZO-1 (zonula occludens-1) as a  protein ( = 4), and Ki-67 as a proliferative cell marker ( = 4) were used to characterize the cells at confluence.At confluence, 8.25% average increase in the number of cells was observed from the central zone compared with 16.% from the peripheral zone. Proliferation rate, hexagonality, Ki-67 positivity, and the cell area did not significantly differ between the groups ( > 0.05). All the proteins corresponding to the biomarkers tested were expressed in both the groups.Although there are significantly fewer amounts of peripheral cells available after graft preparation for keratoplasty, these cells can still be used for endothelial cell culture due to their proliferative capability.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a potent anti-inflammatory agent that regulates intestinal epithelial barrier homeostasis. We previously demonstrated that VIP-ergic neuron expression is decreased in experimental NEC ileum, and this may be associated with inflammation and barrier compromise. We hypothesize that exogenous VIP administration has a beneficial effect in NEC.NEC was induced in C57BL/6 mice by gavage feeding, hypoxia, and lipopolysaccharide administration between postnatal day (P)  and 9. There were four studied groups: Control (n = 6): Breast feeding without stress factors; Control + VIP (n = ): Breast feeding + intraperitoneal VIP injection once a day from P5 to P9; NEC (n = 9): mice exposed to NEC induction; NEC + VIP (n = 9): NEC induction + intraperitoneal VIP injection. Terminal ileum was harvested on P9. NEC severity, intestinal inflammation, (IL-6 and TNFα), and  (Claudin-3) were evaluated.NEC severity and intestinal inflammation were significantly decreased in NEC + VIP compared to NEC.  expression was significantly increased in NEC + VIP compared to NEC.VIP administration has a beneficial therapeutic effect in NEC by reducing inflammation and  disruption.Copyright © 2019.

Inhalation of acid ceramidase facilitated the elimination of P. aeruginosa in acutely- or chronically-infected mice with cystic fibrosis. Thus, inhalation of acid ceramidase might be a preventive and/or curative treatment for patients with cystic fibrosis suffering from pneumonia.We treated cultured epithelial cells or leukemic T-lymphocytes (Jurkat cells) with purified acid ceramidase and determined intracellular signalling events, proliferation and cell survival. Specifically, we measured the activity of AKT, p38-kinase and p70S6-kinase using activation-specific phospho-antibodies in western blot studies. Trypan Blue staining served to analyze proliferation and cell survival.Our studies indicate that treatment of Chang epithelial cells or Jurkat T lymphocytes with purified acid ceramidase results in a dose dependent activation of AKT, p38-kinase and p70S6-kinase, while tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins remains largely unchanged. Acid ceramidase treatment did not change expression of  proteins such as ZO-1, ZO-2 and occludin. Cellular viability and proliferation were not affected by acid ceramidase treatment.Our data suggest that treatment of epithelial cells and lymphocytes with acid ceramidase results in activation of distinct pathways, in particular AKT- and p38K-dependent pathways, while no global activation or cell death was observed.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Experiments were conducted in broiler chickens to evaluate supplementation of L-glutamine, glycine, and L-arginine in a reduced protein (RP) diet. Experiment 1 examined the growth performance of broilers fed  dietary treatments: 1) a standard diet; 2) an RP diet (193.9 g/kg CP in grower and 176.9 g/kg CP in finisher); 3) RP diet supplemented with 10 g/kg L-Gln; 4) RP diet supplemented with 10 g/kg Gly; ) RP diet supplemented with  g/kg L-Arg. Each experimental diet was replicated 6 times with 10 birds per replicate. In a subset of 96 birds, experiment 2 tested the 4 RP diets with and without dexamethasone (DEX) to induce leaky gut. Each diet was replicated 24 times. Fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) was used to test intestinal permeability (IP). Gene expression of selected  proteins in ileal and jejunal tissues was assayed by quantitative PCR. From day 7 to 35, the RP diet increased feed intake (FI) (P < 0.05) and body weight gain (BWG) compared with the standard diet while Gln reduced FI and BWG (P < 0.05) compared with RP. Gly had no effect on BWG or FCR. Supplementation of Arg improved FCR from day 21 to 35 and day 7 to 35. In experiment 2, Arg tended to lower FITC-d (P = 0.086). DEX increased passage of FITC-d into the serum (P < 0.001). The villi surface area was increased in birds fed higher Arg (P < 0.05). DEX and diet interacted (P < 0.01) for jejunal claudin-3 mRNA level where DEX upregulated claudin-3 for all diets except the Arg diet. In summary, with a moderate reduction of protein, satisfactory performance can be obtained. Although Gln and Gly had no demonstrable positive effect on IP and performance of broilers, increasing the dietary Arg by approximately 140% improved FCR and showed indications of improved intestinal barrier function of birds fed an RP diet under a stress model.© The Author(s) 2019.

Being a substitute for the extensively used endocrine-disrupting chemical BPA, Bisphenol AF (BPAF) has been known as teratogen with developmental toxicities and therefore potentially putting human into the risk of biological hazards. Herein, we deciphered the detrimental effects of BPAF on spermatogenesis and spermiotiliosis in sexual maturity of mice exposing to BPAF (, 20, 50 mg/kg/d) for consecutive 28 days. BPAF exposure significantly compromises blood-testis barrier integrity and sperm quantity and quality in a dose-dependent manner. Sperms from BPAF exposure mice are featured by severe DNA damage, altered SUMOylation and ubiquitination dynamics and interfered epigenetic inheritance with hypermethylation of H3K27me3 presumably due to the aggregation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, BPAF treatment (50 μM for 24 h) compromises cytoskeleton architecture and  permeability in primary cultured Sertoli cells evidenced by dysfunction of actin regulatory proteins (e.g. Arp3 and Palladin) via activation of ERK signaling, thereby perturbing the privilege microenvironment created by Sertoli cells for spermatogenesis.

Although precise causes are far from being identified, allergy or other forms of hypersensitivity to dietary ingredients have been implicated in triggering or worsening of behavioral and emotional symptoms, especially in patients suffering from depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity, and/or autism. Among such ingredients, cow's milk, along with wheat gluten, is commonly suspected. However, the contributory role of cow's milk in these disorders has not been elucidated due to insufficient pathophysiological evidence. In the present study, we therefore investigated neuroinflammatory changes that are associated with behavioral abnormality using a non-anaphylactic mouse model of cow's milk allergy (CMA). Male and female C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a -week oral sensitization procedure without or with a major milk allergen, beta-lactoglobulin (BLG). All mice were then later challenged with BLG, and their anxiety- and depression-associated behaviors were subsequently assessed during the 6th and 7th weeks. We found that BLG-sensitized male mice exhibited significantly increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior, although they did not display anaphylactic reactions when challenged with BLG. Female behavior was not noticeably affected by BLG sensitization. Upon examination of the small intestines, reduced immunoreactivity to occludin was detected in the ileal mucosa of BLG-sensitized mice although the transcriptional expression of this  protein was not significantly altered when measured by quantitative RT-PCR. On the other hand, the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) in the ileal mucosa was significantly elevated in BLG-sensitized mice, suggesting the sensitization had resulted in intestinal inflammation. Inflammatory responses were also detected in the brain of BLG-sensitized mice, determined by the hypertrophic morphology of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes. These reactive astrocytes were particularly evident near the blood vessels in the midbrain region, resembling the perivascular barrier previously reported by others in experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) mouse models. Interestingly, increased levels of COX-2 and TNFα were also found in this region. Taken together, our results demonstrated that BLG sensitization elicits inflammatory responses in the intestine and brain without overt anaphylactic signs of milk allergy, signifying food allergy as a potential pathogenic factor of neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182056>Deletion of sorting nexin 27 suppresses proliferation in highly aggressive breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro and in vivo.</a></h1><p>Sorting Nexin 27 (SNX27) belongs to a family of sortin nexins and possesses a unique binding domain at the C-terminus which mediates protein-protein interaction in intracellular trafficking, membrane remodeling, organelle motility, and . However, its role in cancer development, especially in vivo, remains largely unknown.We have generated a stable SNX27 knockdown clone in a highly aggressive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 using an inducible lentiviral shRNA system. Cell migration and proliferation of SNX27 knockdown (KD) cells were compared with wild-type (WT) cells by MTT and wound healing assay, respectively. The differences in colony formation between SNX27-KD and WT cells were detected by soft agar culture and matrigel 3D culture. Furthermore, tumor growth was examined in a xenograft nude mouse model using SNX27-KD and WT MDA-MB-231 cells. The critical EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) regulators were examined in vitro and in vivo.The wound healing assay showed that SNX27 knockdown significantly decreased cell motility and proliferation. Colony formation in soft agar showed that the SNX27 knockdown cells formed significantly fewer and smaller colonies than the parental MDA-MB-231 cells. Western blots and immunostaining showed that knockdown of SNX27 led to increased expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin proteins, which facilitate adhesion formation and reverse EMT. EMT is a cellular program that allows polarized, immotile epithelial cells to convert to motile mesenchymal cells, promoting carcinoma invasion. The expression levels of Vimentin, the transcription factor of EMT, and  protein Claudin-, were significantly diminished in the SNX27 knockdown cells. The expression of PCNA, the cell proliferation marker, was increased in SNX27-KD cells transfected with E-cadherin siRNA. In a xenograft nude mouse model, we found that knockdown of SNX27 significantly inhibited tumor growth. The tumors from mice with SNX27-KD cells showed less proliferation compared to tumors from mice injected with wildtype cells. The increase in E-cadherin and β-catenin and decrease in Vimentin and Claudin- were observed in tumors of mice injected with SNX27-KD cells.Our data have demonstrated that SNX27 plays a crucial role in tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401143>Inflammation-induced Occludin Downregulation Limits Epithelial Apoptosis by Suppressing Caspase-3 Expression.</a></h1><p>Epithelial  are compromised in gastrointestinal disease. Processes that contribute to the resulting barrier loss include endocytic occludin removal from the  and reduced occludin expression. Nevertheless, the relatively-normal basal phenotype of occludin knockout (KO) mice has been taken as evidence that occludin does not contribute to gastrointestinal barrier function. We asked whether stress could unmask occludin functions within intestinal epithelia.Wildtype (WT), universal and intestinal epithelial-specific occludin KO, and villin-EGFP-occludin transgenic mice as well as WT and occludin knockdown (KD) Caco-2 cell monolayers were challenged with DSS, TNBS, staurosporine, -FU, or TNF. Occludin and caspase-3 expression were assessed in patient biopsies.Intestinal epithelial occludin loss limited severity of DSS- and TNBS-induced colitis due to epithelial resistance to apoptosis; activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways was blocked in occludin KO epithelia. Promoter analysis revealed that occludin enhances CASP3 transcription and, conversely, that occludin downregulation reduces caspase-3 expression. Analysis of biopsies from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients and normal controls demonstrated that disease-associated occludin downregulation was accompanied by and correlated with reduced caspase-3 expression. In vitro, cytokine-induced occludin downregulation resulted in reduced caspase-3 expression and resistance to intrinsic and extrinsic pathway apoptosis, demonstrating an overall protective effect of inflammation-induced occludin loss.The  protein occludin regulates apoptosis by enhancing caspase-3 transcription. These data suggest that reduced epithelial caspase-3 expression downstream of occludin downregulation is a previously-unappreciated anti-apoptotic process that contributes to mucosal homeostasis in inflammatory conditions.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Aucubin (AU) is the active ingredient extracted from Eucommia ulmoides. However, its protective action and exact mechanism on testicular injury is not yet known.Here, the protective effect and the mechanism of action of AU on testis damage under oxidative stress was investigated in vivo and in vitro.As regard the in vivo experiment, male mice were divided into five groups and testicular injury model was established by Triptolide (TP) (120 μg/kg) intraperitoneal injection for two weeks. Animals in the treatment group were pretreated with an intraperitoneal injection of AU at different doses (, 10 and 20 mg/kg) for 1 h and subsequently treated with TP (120 μg/kg). At the end of the experimental period, the testis was collected for biochemical and histological examination. As regard the in vitro experiment, Sertoli cells (SCs) were used to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of action of AU against disruption of the blood-testis-barrier (BTB) and apoptosis induced by TP via apoptosis detection, western blot, immunofluorescence analysis, and siRNA transient transfection.TP-treated animals showed testicular atrophy, BTB disruption, increased ROS levels and spermatogenic dysfunction. Pre-administration of AU resulted in a significant protection on keeping a normal testicular weight, sperm morphology, BTB integrity, and a normal level of oxidative stress markers and antioxidants. Furthermore, AU prevented apoptosis through an effective inhibition of PERK/CHOP and JNK dependent apoptosis pathway, as well as protected the integrity of BTB by up-regulating the expression of  proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin-11) and gap  protein (Cx43). The mechanistic study revealed that AU significantly triggered Nrf2 translocation, thus increasing nuclear Nrf2 accumulation and then induced antioxidant enzymes expression in the testis and SCs. Furthermore, Nrf2 silencing unsuccessfully reversed the increased CHOP and p-JNK expression induced by TP, abolishing the protective effect of AU.These results indicate that AU might be considered as a potential protective agent against testicular injury.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Chronic restraint stress (CRS) has been found to exacerbate neurological impairments in an experimental focal cortical ischemia model. However, there have been no studies reporting the effect and mechanism of CRS on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). This study aimed to evaluate the effect of CRS on a mouse ICH model. Adult male C57BL mice were subjected to infusion of collagenase IV (to induce ICH) or saline (for sham) into the left striatum. After ICH, animals were stressed with application of CRS protocol for 21 days. Our results showed that CRS significantly exacerbated neurological deficits (Garcia test, corner turn test, and wire grip test) and the ipsilateral brain atrophy and reduced body weight gain after ICH. Immunofluorescence staining indicated that CRS exerted significant suppressive effects on neuron, astrocyte, vascular endothelial cell and pericyte and excessively activated microglia post ICH. All of the key cellular components mentioned above are involved in the neurovascular unit (NVU) remodeling in the peri-hemorrhagic region after ICH. Western blot results showed that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and  (TJ) proteins including zonula occludens-1, occludin and claudin- were increased after ICH, but MMP-9 protein was further up-regulated and TJ-related proteins were down-regulated by CRS. In addition, ICH-induced activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis were further strengthened by CRS. Collectively, CRS exacerbates neurological deficits and disrupts the remodeling of the peri-hemorrhagic NVU after ICH, which may be associated with TJ proteins degradation and excessive activation of MMP-9 and endoplasmic reticulum stress-apoptosis. LAY SUMMARY CRS exacerbates neurological deficits and disrupts the remodeling of the NVU in the recovery stage after ICH, which suggest that monitoring chronic stress levels in patients recovering from ICH may merit consideration in the future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31319027>Chenodeoxycholic Acid (CDCA) Protects against the Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Impairment of the Intestinal Epithelial Barrier Function via the FXR-MLCK Pathway.</a></h1><p>Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), a primary bile acid, has been demonstrated to play important roles as a signaling molecule in various physiology functions. However, the role of CDCA in regulating intestinal barrier function remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of CDCA on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function and explore the underlying mechanisms. In IPEC-J2 cells, CDCA reversed the LPS-induced increase in transepithelial electrical resistance and decrease in  protein expression. In addition, we found that farnesoid X receptor (FXR) but not Takeda G-protein receptor  was responsible for the CDCA-improved epithelial barrier function impaired by LPS. Furthermore, CDCA blocked LPS-induced activation of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) pathway in a FXR-dependent manner and elicited similar effects to MLCK inhibition. In mice, CDCA supplementation restored LPS-induced elevation of intestinal permeability and MLCK expression and reduction of  protein expression, thus alleviating LPS-induced intestinal barrier impairment. In conclusion, CDCA protected against the LPS-induced impairment of the intestinal epithelial barrier function via the FXR-MLCK pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578523>The RIPK4-IRF6 signalling axis safeguards epidermal differentiation and barrier function.</a></h1><p>The integrity of the mammalian epidermis depends on a balance of proliferation and differentiation in the resident population of stem cells. The kinase RIPK4 and the transcription factor IRF6 are mutated in severe developmental syndromes in humans, and mice lacking these genes display epidermal hyperproliferation and soft-tissue fusions that result in neonatal lethality. Our understanding of how these genes control epidermal differentiation is incomplete. Here we show that the role of RIPK4 in mouse development requires its kinase activity; that RIPK4 and IRF6 expressed in the epidermis regulate the same biological processes; and that the phosphorylation of IRF6 at Ser413 and Ser424 primes IRF6 for activation. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), histone chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) of skin in wild-type and IRF6-deficient mouse embryos, we define the transcriptional programs that are regulated by IRF6 during epidermal differentiation. IRF6 was enriched at bivalent promoters, and IRF6 deficiency caused defective expression of genes that are involved in the metabolism of lipids and the formation of . Accordingly, the lipid composition of the stratum corneum of Irf6 skin was abnormal, culminating in a severe defect in the function of the epidermal barrier. Collectively, our results explain how RIPK4 and IRF6 function to ensure the integrity of the epidermis and provide mechanistic insights into why developmental syndromes that are characterized by orofacial, skin and genital abnormalities result when this axis goes awry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040263>Propofol Protects Lung Endothelial Barrier Function by Suppression of High-Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) Release and Mitochondrial Oxidative Damage Catalyzed by HMGB1.</a></h1><p>BACKGROUND The processes of mechanical ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) triggers the release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a prominent damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) family member, which can cause damage to pulmonary vascular endothelial cells. We aimed to determine whether propofol protected against endothelial cell injury induced by HMGB1 in vitro and in vivo. MATERIAL AND METHODS ICR mice (male) were mechanically ventilated for 4 h after anesthetization at both low tidal volume (LVT, 6 ml/kg) and high tidal volume (HVT, 30 ml/kg). A propofol bolus (10 mg/kg) was administered to the animals prior to the onset of ventilation, followed by infusion at  mg/(kg·h). We obtained confluent cultures of mouse lung vascular endothelial cells (MLVECs) and then performed cyclic stretching at 20% stretch for 4 h with or without propofol. RESULTS HMGB1 reduced the expression of  between endothelial cells, including VE-cadherin and ZO-1, and increased endothelial permeability, and both were blocked by propofol. We found that MLVECs exhibited mitochondrial oxidative damage by HMGB1, which was successfully suppressed through administration of MnTBAP as well as propofol. Propofol ameliorated HVT-associated lung vascular hyperpermeability and HMGB1 production in vivo. Propofol also inhibited HMBG1 release caused by cyclic stretching in MLVECs in vitro. CONCLUSIONS Our results prove that the cyto-protective function of propofol protects against lung ventilation-induced dysfunction of the lung endothelial barrier. This function of propofol is mediated through inhibition of HMGB1 release caused by mechanical stretching and mitochondrial oxidative damage triggered by HMGB1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31243129>Dual Recognition of Sialic Acid and αGal Epitopes by the VP8* Domains of the Bovine Rotavirus G6P[] WC3 and of Its Mono-reassortant G4P[] RotaTeq Vaccine Strains.</a></h1><p>Group A rotaviruses, an important cause of severe diarrhea in children and young animals, initiate infection via interactions of the VP8* domain of the VP4 spike protein with cell surface sialic acids (SAs) or histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). Although the bovine G6P[] WC3 strain is an important animal pathogen and is also used in the bovine-human reassortant RotaTeq vaccine, the receptor(s) for the VP8* domain of WC3 and its reassortant strains have not yet been identified. In the present study, HBGA- and saliva-binding assays showed that both G6P[] WC3 and mono-reassortant G4P[] strains recognized the αGal HBGA. The infectivity of both P[]-bearing strains was significantly reduced in αGal-free MA-104 cells by pretreatment with a broadly specific neuraminidase or by coincubation with the α2,6-linked SA-specific  lectin, but not by the α2,3-linked specific sialidase or by  lectin. Free NeuAc and the αGal trisaccharide also prevented the infectivity of both strains. This indicated that both P[]-bearing strains utilize α2,6-linked SA as a ligand on MA104 cells. However, the two strains replicated in differentiated bovine small intestinal enteroids and in their human counterparts that lack α2,6-linked SA or αGal HBGA, suggesting that additional or alternative receptors such as integrins, hsp70, and  proteins bound directly to the VP5* domain can be used by the P[]-bearing strains to initiate the infection of human cells. In addition, these data also suggested that P[]-bearing strains have potential for cross-species transmission. Group A rotaviruses initiate infection through the binding of the VP8* domain of the VP4 protein to sialic acids (SAs) or histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). Although the bovine G6P[] WC3 strain is an important animal pathogen and is used as the backbone in the bovine-human reassortant RotaTeq vaccine, the receptor(s) for their P[] VP8* domain has remained elusive. Using a variety of approaches, we demonstrated that the WC3 and bovine-human mono-reassortant G4P[] vaccine strains recognize both α2,6-linked SA and αGal HBGA as ligands. Neither ligand is expressed on human small intestinal epithelial cells, explaining the absence of natural human infection by P[]-bearing strains. However, we observed that the P[]-bearing WC3 and G4P[] RotaTeq vaccine strains could still infect human intestinal epithelial cells. Thus, the four P[] RotaTeq vaccine strains potentially binding to additional alternative receptors may be efficient and effective in providing protection against severe rotavirus disease in human.Copyright © 2019 Alfajaro et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31328776>Candidate genes of the transcellular and paracellular calcium absorption pathways in the small intestine of laying hens.</a></h1><p>To meet the high calcium (Ca) demand during eggshell biomineralization (2 g of Ca per egg), laying hens develop specific metabolic regulations to maintain Ca homeostasis. The intake of Ca, its solubilization, and absorption capacity are enhanced at sexual maturity (SM). A better knowledge of the intestinal Ca transporters involved in their variations at this stage could indicate new nutritional strategies to enhance Ca digestive utilization. Transcellular Ca absorption pathway and its major player calbindin-D 28 K (CALB1) mediate a saturable transport, which has been extensively described in this model. Conversely, a contribution by the paracellular pathway involving non-saturable Ca transport through intercellular  has also been suggested. The aim of the present study was to identify candidate genes of these two pathways and their patterns of expression, in immature pullets (12, 15, and 17 wk old) and mature laying hens (23 wk old) in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Using RT-qPCR, this study identifies 3 new candidate genes for transcellular, and 9 for paracellular Ca transport. A total of  candidates of the transcellular pathway, transient receptor potential cation channels subfamily C member 1 (TRPC1) and M member 7 (TRPM7); CALB1 and ATPase plasma membrane Ca2+ transporting 1 (ATP2B1) and ATPase plasma membrane Ca2+ transporting 2 (ATP2B2) were enhanced with age or after SM in the duodenum, the jejunum or all 3 segments. A total of 4 candidates of the paracellular pathway Claudin 2 (CLDN2) and  proteins 1, 2, and 3 (TJP1, TJP2 and TJP3) increased in the small intestine after SM. Additionally, CALB1, ATP2B2, and CLDN2 were overexpressed in the duodenum or the jejunum or both segments after SM. The enhanced expression of candidate genes of the paracellular Ca pathway after SM, supports that the non-saturable transport could be a mechanism of great importance when high concentrations of soluble Ca are observed in the intestinal content during eggshell formation. Both pathways may work cooperatively in the duodenum and jejunum, the main sites of Ca absorption in laying hens.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which oil spill-related compounds alters behavior remains largely unknown. A major cause of behavioral changes generally is dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We investigated the impact of a crude oil high energy water accommodated fraction (HEWAF), benzo[a] pyrene (BaP; a major component of crude oil), and the oil dispersant COREXIT, on BBB function. BBB function was assessed by measuring transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). Within 3 h after treatment, TEER was significantly reduced by exposure to high concentrations of all test compounds. TEER remained reduced in response to COREXIT after 48 h, but this effect waned in BMECs treated with HEWAF and BaP, with low-mid range concentrations inducing increased TEER compared to vehicle controls. At 48 h of treatment, BMEC viability was significantly reduced in response to 2% HEWAF, but was increased in response to BaP (25 and 50 μM). BMEC viability was increased with 80 ppm COREXIT, but was reduced with 160 ppm. Gene expression of -associated proteins (claudin- and  protein-1), and cell adhesion receptor (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) was reduced in response to HEWAF and COREXIT, but not BaP. Taken together, these data suggest that oil spill-related compounds markedly affect BBB function, and that these changes may underlie the observed behavioral changes due to crude oil exposure.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310955>Neuroprotective effect of Vanillin on hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in neonatal rats.</a></h1><p>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) is a leading cause of death and perpetual neurological dysfunction in neonates. Vanillin (Van), a natural phenolic compound with neuroprotective properties, exerts neuroprotection on a gerbil model of global ischemia by inhibiting oxidative damage. This study aimed to explore the potential neuroprotective roles of Van in neonatal rats suffering from hypoxic-ischemic (HI). An HI model of 7-day-old SD rats was induced by left carotid artery ligation followed by exposure to 8% oxygen (balanced with nitrogen) for 2. h at 37 °C. At 48 h after intraperitoneal injection with Van (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg) or saline, neurobehavioral function, cerebral infract volume, brain water content, and histomorphological changes were performed to evaluate brain injury. Transmission electron microscopy and immunoglobulin G (IgG) staining were conducted to evaluate the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The levels of oxidative stress and  proteins, as well as the activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), were also determined in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Results showed that Van post-treatment significantly ameliorated early neurobehavioral deficits, decreased infarct volume and brain edema, as well as attenuated histopathologic injury and IgG extravasation. Furthermore, Van markedly increased the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and decreased malondialdehyde content. Meanwhile, the activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 induced by HI was partially blocked by Van. Finally, Van obviously increased the expression of ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin- compared with the HI group. Collectively, Van can provide neuroprotective effects against neonatal HIBD possibly by attenuating oxidative damage and preserving BBB integrity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Intestinal porcine epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells were used as an  physiological model of the intestinal epithelium to study the effects of different concentrations of soybean antigen protein β-conglycinin to identify the involved signaling pathways. The cells were divided into eight groups and either untreated or treated with different concentrations of β-conglycinin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (l-NAME), SP600125, and SB202190 either alone or in combination. The cells were incubated with 1, , and 10 mg·mL β-conglycinin or  mg·mL β-conglycinin and 1 μmol·L nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) inhibitor (PDTC), inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (l-NAME), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor (SP600125), and p38 inhibitor (SB202190) for 24 h, separately; controls were left untreated. The mRNA, protein, and phosphorylation levels of NF-κB, p38, and JNK were higher in the treated groups than in the control group. β-Conglycinin decreased  distribution, destroyed the cytoskeleton of IPEC-J2 cells, and caused cell death. After the addition of the inhibitors, β-conglycinin-induced IPEC-J2 cell damage was significantly reduced. β-Conglycinin caused damage to IPEC-J2 cells via the mitogen-activated protein kinase/NF-κB signaling pathway.

Claudin-3 is a key component of , which may serve as marker of gut barrier integrity.The aim of the study was to investigate circulating plasma claudin-3 in patients with psoriasis and to evaluate clinical and metabolic factors, which determine its concentration.This cross-sectional study included 60 patients with psoriasis (39 men and 21 women, mean age: 45.6 ± 12.1 years) and 30 healthy controls (18 men and 12 women, mean age: 46.3 ± 15. years) age, sex and body mass index-matched. Plasma claudin-3 concentration was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Plasma claudin-3 concentration was significantly higher in patients with psoriasis in comparison with healthy control [median (interquartile range), 50.7 ng/mL (47.3-54.2) vs. 43.3 ng/mL (42.3-44.2), P < 0.001]. Patients who achieved ΔPASI90 response after 16 weeks of treatment showed tendency to decrease in circulating claudin-3 plasma concentration.

Here, we characterized the functional role of circular RNA USP1 (circ-USP1) in the regulation of the blood-tumour barrier (BTB) permeability and the potential mechanisms. In the current study, the circ-USP1 expressing level was up-regulated in glioma cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (GECs) of the BTB model in vitro. Knockdown of circ-USP1 disrupted the barrier integrity, increased its permeability as well as reduced -related protein claudin-, occludin and ZO-1 expressions in GECs. Bioinformatic prediction and luciferase assay indicated that circ-USP1 bound to miR-194-5p and suppressed its activity. MiR-194-5p contributed to circ-USP1 knockdown-induced increase of BTB permeability via targeting and down-regulating transcription factor FLI1. Furthermore, FLI1 regulated the expressions of claudin-, occludin and ZO-1 in GECs through binding to their promoter regions. Single or combined treatment of circ-USP1 and miR-194-5p effectively promoted anti-tumour drug doxorubicin across BTB to induce apoptosis of glioma cells. Overall, this present study identified the crucial regulation of circ-USP1 on BTB permeability via miR-194-5p/FLI1 axis-mediated regulation of  proteins, which might facilitate the development of therapeutics against human gliomas.© 2019 The Authors.

This study aimed to determine the underlying pathological mechanism of the preoperative MRI-CCP reverse tracing method by assessing the histopathological changes from the origin to the peripheral sites of SNIP.The originating site of SNIP was predicted by preoperative MRI in 30 consecutive patients suspected to have primary SNIP.

The transcription factor p63 regulates the expression of cadherin family and induces epithelial cell proliferation. In this study, we hypothesized that p-EMT under p63 expression may be a key factor in epithelial cell growth in middle ear cholesteatoma.Specimens were surgically excised from patients with congenital cholesteatoma (CC) (n = 48), acquired middle ear cholesteatoma (AC) (n = 120), and normal skin tissue (n = 34). We analyzed immunohistochemically for the EMT marker (N-cadherin), adherence  marker (E-cadherin), and  marker (claudin-1, claudin-4, occludin). We also examined the labeling index (LI) of p63 and Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (late S phase marker), and Snail expression as a mobility marker.The expression of p63 (CC 51.0 ± 7.4%, AC 50.0 ± .9%) was significantly higher in the thickened epithelium of CC and AC compared with normal skin tissue (p < 0.0001). The loss of E-cadherin was observed (CC 50.0%, AC 55.8%) but the expression patterns in the  were almost normal. N-cadherin was partially detected in the basal and upper layer of epithelium in CC and AC. In contrast to that of normal skin tissue, the LI of PCNA was significantly higher in AC (p < 0.0001). The positive rate of Snail was significantly higher in CC (p < 0.0001).This study indicates that p-EMT via the p63 signaling pathway might plays an essential role in epithelial growth in AC and CC formation, although  formation and terminal differentiation were not affected in those processes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551405>Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor Reduces Permeability and Apoptosis of Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells in Response to Oxygen and Glucose Deprivation Followed by Reoxygenation via the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 (FGFR1)/ERK Pathway.</a></h1><p>BACKGROUND Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a mechanism in the pathogenesis of traumatic brain injury. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is expressed in angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and neuronal survival. This study aimed to investigate the role of bFGF in vitro in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) challenged by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). MATERIAL AND METHODS HBMECs were cultured in glucose-free medium and an environment with <0.% oxygen in an anaerobic chamber. Immunocytochemistry, Western blot, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were used to measure the protein and mRNA expression levels of bFGF, , adherens , apoptotic proteins, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The effects of bFGF on the viability of HBMECs was evaluated using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated using the TUNEL assay, and endothelial permeability was quantified using a transwell migration assay with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated with dextran. The effects of bFGF were evaluated following inhibition of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) with PD173074 and inhibition of ERK with PD98059. RESULTS Following OGD/R of HBMECs, bFGF significantly reduced cell permeability and apoptosis and significantly inhibited the down-regulation of the expressions of proteins associated with , adherens , apoptosis and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The effects of bFGF were mediated by the activation of FGFR1 and ERK, as they were blocked by FGFR1 and ERK inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS Permeability and apoptosis of HBMECs challenged by OGD/R were reduced by bFGF by activation of the FGFR1 and the ERK pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511021>Claudin-12 is not required for blood-brain barrier  function.</a></h1><p>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) ensures central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis by strictly controlling the passage of molecules and solutes from the bloodstream into the CNS. Complex and continuous  (TJs) between brain endothelial cells block uncontrolled paracellular diffusion of molecules across the BBB, with claudin- being its dominant TJs protein. However, claudin- deficient mice still display ultrastructurally normal TJs, suggesting the contribution of other claudins or  associated proteins in establishing BBB junctional complexes. Expression of claudin-12 at the BBB has been reported, however the exact function and subcellular localization of this atypical claudin remains unknown.We created claudin-12-lacZ-knock-in C57BL/6J mice to explore expression of claudin-12 and its role in establishing BBB TJs function during health and neuroinflammation. We furthermore performed a broad standardized phenotypic check-up of the mouse mutant.Making use of the lacZ reporter allele, we found claudin-12 to be broadly expressed in numerous organs. In the CNS, expression of claudin-12 was detected in many cell types with very low expression in brain endothelium. Claudin-12 C57BL/6J mice lacking claudin-12 expression displayed an intact BBB and did not show any signs of BBB dysfunction or aggravated neuroinflammation in an animal model for multiple sclerosis. Determining the precise localization of claudin-12 at the BBB was prohibited by the fact that available anti-claudin-12 antibodies showed comparable detection and staining patterns in tissues from wild-type and claudin-12 C57BL/6J mice.Our present study thus shows that claudin-12 is not essential in establishing or maintaining BBB TJs integrity. Claudin-12 is rather expressed in cells that typically lack TJs suggesting that claudin-12 plays a role other than forming classical TJs. At the same time, in depth phenotypic screening of clinically relevant organ functions of claudin-12 C57BL/6J mice suggested the involvement of claudin-12 in some neurological but, more prominently, in cardiovascular functions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31261992>Absence of MCP-induced Protein 1 Enhances Blood-Brain Barrier Breakdown after Experimental Stroke in Mice.</a></h1><p>Focal cerebral ischemia can cause blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, which is implicated in neuroinflammation and progression of brain damage. Monocyte chemotactic protein 1-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1) is a newly identified zinc-finger protein that negatively regulates inflammatory signaling pathways. We aimed to evaluate the impact of genetic MCPIP1 deletion on BBB breakdown and expression of BBB-related matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and  proteins after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) using MCPIP1-deficient (MCPIP1) mice. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced in the MCPIP1 mice and their wild-type littermates for 2 h followed by reperfusion for 24 h. The degree of BBB breakdown was evaluated by injection of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and immunohistochemistry were performed to compare the expression of MMPs and claudin- and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). MCPIP1 deficiency in mice resulted in enhanced leakage of FITC-dextran, increased expression of MMP-9/3, and reduced expression of claudin- and ZO-1 in the brain compared to that seen in their wild-type littermates subjected to cerebral I/R. These results demonstrate that absence of MCPIP1 exacerbates cerebral I/R-induced BBB disruption by enhancing the expression of MMP-9/3 and the degradation of claudin- and ZO-1, providing novel insights into the mechanisms underlying BBB breakdown after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980891>Inorganic nitrate prevents the loss of  proteins and modulates inflammatory events induced by broad-spectrum antibiotics: A role for intestinal microbiota?</a></h1><p>Upon consumption, dietary nitrate is reduced to nitrite in the oral cavity and to nitric oxide (NO) in the stomach. Here, NO increases mucosal blood flow, mucus thickness and prevents microbial infections. However, the impact of nitrate on gut microbiota, a pleiotropic organism essential to maintain gastrointestinal and systemic welfare, remains elusive. This study investigates the impact of nitrate on gut microbiota profile and ensued mucosal effects during dysbiosis. Male Wistar rats were randomly distributed in 4 groups and the drinking water was supplemented for 7 days as follows: 1) antibiotic cocktail (neomycin, bacitracin and imipenem), 2) antibiotic cocktail + sodium nitrate, 3) sodium nitrate and 4) regular drinking water. Animals were weighted daily and feces were collected before and after the treatment. The stomach was isolated and the expression of occludin, claudin- as well as myeloperoxidase and iNOS was studied. Bacterial DNA was analyzed in fecal samples by PCR-DGGE genetic fingerprinting. Nitrate prevented antibiotic-induced body weight loss (1.9 ± 1.8% vs 8.9 ± 1.8%, p < 0.05) and cecamegalia (7.1 ± 0.% vs .6 ± 0.4%, p < 0.05). Gastric expression of occludin and claudin- tended to decrease during dysbiosis but both protein levels were recovered following nitrate consumption (p < 0.05). Similarly, nitrate inhibited the overexpression of myeloperoxidase and iNOS observed under dysbiosis (p < 0.05). Broad spectrum antibiotics significantly decreased microbiota richness and diversity in comparison to controls (p = 0.0016). After 7 days of treatment, whereas antibiotics reduced microbiota richness by 56%, it was observed that nitrate was able to prevent such microbial loss to only 48%, although without statistical differences (p = 0.068). This data suggests that dietary nitrate may be envisaged as a key component of functional foods with beneficial impact on gastric mucosal integrity during antibiotherapy but further studies are mandatory to better ascertain as to whether it modulates intestinal microbiota in terms of taxonomic and functional levels.Copyright © 2019.

Despite this opportunity, identification of protein-protein interfaces remains challenging. We have previously developed a method that relies on coating protein surfaces with small-molecule dyes to discriminate between solvent-accessible protein surfaces and hidden interface regions. Dye-bound, solvent-accessible protein regions resist trypsin digestion, whereas hidden interface regions are revealed by denaturation and sequenced by MS. The small-molecule dyes bind promiscuously and with high affinity, but their binding mechanism is unknown. Here, we report on the optimization of a novel dye probe used in protein painting, Fast Blue B + naphthionic acid, and show that its affinity for proteins strongly depends on hydrophobic moieties that we call here "hydrophobic clamps." We demonstrate the utility of this probe by sequencing the protein-protein interaction regions between the Hippo pathway protein Yes-associated protein 2 (YAP2) and  protein 1 (TJP1 or ZO-1), uncovering interactions via the known binding domain as well as ZO-1's MAGUK domain and YAP's N-terminal proline-rich domain. Additionally, we demonstrate how residues predicted by protein painting are present exclusively in the complex interface and how these residues may guide the development of peptide inhibitors using a case study of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). Inhibitors designed around the PD-1/PD-L1 interface regions identified via protein painting effectively disrupted complex formation, with the most potent inhibitor having an IC of  μm.© 2019 Haymond et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260736>Dietary sodium butyrate (Butirex C4) supplementation modulates intestinal transcriptomic responses and augments disease resistance of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).</a></h1><p>Intestine in fish is a complex multifunctional organ, not only plays roles in digestion and absorption of nutrient, but also has critical role in immunity. The present study evaluated the effects of different levels of dietary sodium butyrate [Butirex C4 (Butirex)] on intestinal immune-,antioxidant-and -related gene expression injuvenile rainbow trout(Oncorhynchusmykiss). 240 healthy rainbow trout were dispensed in 12 fiberglass tanks appointed to four treatments [0 (control), 1. (B1.), 2. (B2.) and  (B5)g Butirex per kg diet]. After a 45-day feeding trial, the fish fed with the Butirex-supplemented diets showed higher intestinal lysozyme (LYZ), complement(ACH50) and bactericidal activities; the elevations in ACH50 and bactericidal activities depended on Butirex levels (P < 0.05). The Butirex-supplemented groups, particularly the B2. group, had significantly higher LYZ gene expression compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Butirex at 2. and  g/kg levels led to significantly higher IL-1β gene expression. B2. and B5 had significantly lower and higher TNF-α gene expression compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The B2. group had significantly higher TGF-B, and significantly lower IL-8 compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The B1. and B2. group had significantly higher IL-10 gene expression compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The B2. and B5 groups had significantly higher SOD gene expression compared to the other groups; the highest expression was related to the B2. group (P < 0.05). Dietary Butirex supplementation significantly up-regulated CAT and GPx genes expression compared to the control group; the highest expression as related to the B2. and B5 groups (P < 0.05). The B2. group had significantly lower CLD12 gene expression compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The B2. and B5 groups had significantly higher CLD3, OCLD and ZO-1 gene expression compared to the control. The highest CLD3, ZO-1 gene expressions was related to the B2., and B5 groups respectively (P < 0.05). After challenge with Streptococcus iniae, B2. and B5 had significantly higher survival compared to the control group (55.6 ± 7.70 and 68.9 ± 10.2 vs. 33.3 ± 6.67). In conclusion, Butirex is efficient immune stimulant and health booster in rainbow trout, which augments the fish resistance to disease. Modulation of immune components, cytokines, antioxidant system and intestinal integrity might involve in improving disease resistance in Butirex-treated fish. Although most of the examined genes were modulated by 2. g/kg Butirex under normal conditions,  g/kg level is recommended under pathogenic state to mitigate mortality.Copyright © 2019.

We examined the interaction between CKD and brain microhemorrhages (the neuropathological substrate of microbleeds) in mouse and cell culture models and studied progression of microbleed burden on serial brain imaging from humans. Mouse studies: Two CKD models were investigated: adenine-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis and surgical /6 nephrectomy. Cell culture studies: bEnd.3 mouse brain endothelial cells were grown to confluence, and monolayer integrity was measured after exposure to -15% human uremic serum or increasing concentrations of urea. Human studies: Progression of brain microbleeds was evaluated on serial MRI from control, pre-dialysis CKD, and dialysis patients. Microhemorrhages were increased 2-2.-fold in mice with CKD independent of higher blood pressure in the /6 nephrectomy model. IgG staining was increased in CKD animals, consistent with increased blood-brain barrier permeability. Incubation of bEnd.3 cells with uremic serum or elevated urea produced a dose-dependent drop in trans-endothelial electrical resistance. Elevated urea induced actin cytoskeleton derangements and decreased claudin- expression. In human subjects, prevalence of microbleeds was 50% in both CKD cohorts compared with 10% in age-matched controls. More patients in the dialysis cohort had increased microbleeds on follow-up MRI after 1. years. CKD disrupts the blood-brain barrier and increases brain microhemorrhages in mice and microbleeds in humans. Elevated urea alters the actin cytoskeleton and  proteins in cultured endothelial cells, suggesting that these mechanisms explain (at least in part) the microhemorrhages and microbleeds observed in the animal and human studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632292>YangXue QingNao Wan, a Compound Chinese Medicine, Attenuates Cerebrovascular Hyperpermeability and Neuron Injury in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat: Effect and Mechanism.</a></h1><p>The purpose of the study was to explore the effect of YangXue QingNao Wan (YXQNW), a compound Chinese medicine, on cerebrovascular hyperpermeability, neuronal injury, and related mechanisms in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR).Fourteen-week-old male SHR were used, with Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats as control. YXQNW (0. g/kg/day), enalapril (EN, 8 mg/kg/day), and nifedipine (NF, 7.1 mg/kg/day) were administrated orally for 4 weeks. To assess the effects of the YXQNW on blood pressure, the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean blood pressure (MBP) were measured. After administering the drugs for 4 weeks, the cerebral blood flow (CBF), albumin leakage from microvessels in middle cerebral artery (MCA)-dominated area, and the number and morphology of microvessels were assessed in the hippocampus area and cortex. Neuronal damage and apoptosis were assessed by Nissl staining and TUNEL staining. To assess the mechanisms of cerebrovascular hyperpermeability, we performed immunofluorescence and Western blot to assess the expression and integrity of cerebral microvascular  (TJ) and caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in cortex. Energy metabolism and Src-MLC-MLCK pathway in cortex were assessed then for elucidating the underlying mechanism of the observed effect of YXQNW.Spontaneously hypertensive rat exhibited higher blood pressure, Evans blue (EB) extravasation, albumin leakage, increased brain water content, decreased CBF, perivascular edema, and neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus and cortex, all of which were attenuated by YXQNW treatment. YXQNW inhibited the downregulation of TJ proteins, mitochondrial Complex I, Complex II, and Complex V, and upregulation of caveolin-1, inhibiting Src/MLCK/MLC signaling in SHR. YXQNW combined with EN + NF revealed a better effect for some outcomes compared with either YXQNW or EN + NF alone.The overall result shows the potential of YXQNW to attenuate blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown in SHR, which involves regulation of energy metabolism and Src/MLCK/MLC signaling. This result provides evidence supporting the application of YXQNW as an adjuvant management for hypertensive patients to prevent hypertensive encephalopathy.Copyright © 2019 Jiao, Huang, Yan, Sun, Pan, Li, Fan, Ma and Han.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31442901>Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of soft and firm grass carp muscle.</a></h1><p>Fish muscle firmness is an important quality trait for consumer acceptance. Phosphorylation is known to change chemical and physical properties of proteins and is thus expected to affect muscle firmness, but only few such phosphoproteins have been identified. To explore phosphoproteins that affect fish muscle firmness, firm muscle (crisp grass carp) and soft muscle (ordinary grass carp) were analyzed by quantitative phosphoproteomics. We identified 27 up-regulated and 22 down-regulated phosphopeptides in crisp grass carp (ratio ≥1. or ≤0.667, and P-value < 0.05) and their potential upstream kinases. Protein-protein interaction analysis clustered these phosphoproteins into four groups, many of which have been suggested to impact muscle firmness and its postmortem changes: muscle fiber, connective tissue, carbohydrate metabolism and signal regulation. These results provide novel insights into the role of protein phosphorylation in fish muscle firmness and will contribute to the quality improvement of fish products.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is effective for treating SBS, but is rapidly inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4). DPP4 inhibitor (DPP4I) is known to be effective for treating SBS. Here, we investigated cell  protein function following DPP4I administration in a mouse model of SBS.Mice were divided into four groups: naïve (n = ), naïve + DPP4I (n = 6), control (n = 6), and DPP4I (n = ). All control and DPP4I mice had 50% of their proximal small bowel resected. DPP4I or normal saline was administered orally twice daily from days 1-7 postoperatively. The functions of cell  proteins were assessed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Body weights and blood glucose levels were recorded.E-Cadherin was significantly higher in the DPP4I group than in the control group. E-Cadherin, occludin, and claudin-4 were significantly higher in the naïve group than in the control group. Positive staining for E-cadherin and occludin varied widely between the control and DPP4I groups.Up-regulation of E-cadherin and occludin by DPP4I may be correlated with the anti-inflammatory action of DPP4I.

It plays a protective role in bacterial infection, and recent findings indicate that this receptor modulates monocyte populations in mice with malaria; however, its role in cerebral malaria progression and outcome is unclear. By using TRPV1 wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice, the importance of TRPV1 to this cerebral syndrome was investigated. Infection with  ANKA decreased TRPV1 expression in the brain. Mice lacking TRPV1 were protected against -induced mortality and morbidity, a response that was associated with less cerebral swelling, modulation of the brain expression of endothelial  markers (junctional adhesion molecule A and claudin-), increased oxidative stress (via inhibition of catalase activity and increased levels of HO, nitrotyrosine, and carbonyl residues), and diminished production of cytokines.  load was not significantly affected by TRPV1 ablation. Repeated subcutaneous administration of the selective TRPV1 antagonist SB366791 after malaria induction increased TRPV1 expression in the brain tissue and enhanced mouse survival.

Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize the electrospun nanofibers, and controlled release studies were performed at pH 6. and 7.4 in saline buffer, suggesting that the release of polyphenols from xanthan nanofibers follows a non-Fickian mechanism. Furthermore, the X-GA and X-EGCG nanofibers were incubated with Caco-2 cells, and the cell viability, transepithelial transport, and permeability properties across cell monolayers were investigated. An increase of GA and EGCG permeability was observed when the polyphenols were loaded into xanthan nanofibers, compared to the free compounds.

Thus, increasing the therapeutic window of tPA is important for stroke recovery. We previously showed that prothymosin alpha (ProTα) or its mimetic hexapeptide (P6Q) has anti-ischemic activity. Here, we examined the beneficial effects of ProTα or P6Q against delayed tPA-induced brain damage following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or photochemically induced thrombosis in mice. Brain hemorrhage was observed by tPA administration during reperfusion at 4. and 6 h after MCAO. Co-administration of ProTα with tPA at 4. h inhibited hemorrhage and motor dysfunction 2-4 days, but not 7 days after MCAO. ProTα administration at 2 and 4. h after MCAO significantly inhibited tPA (4. h)-induced motor dysfunction and death more than 7 days. Administration of tPA caused the loss of  proteins, zona occulden-1 and occludin, and up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2/9, in a ProTα-reversible manner. P6Q administration abolished tPA (4. h)-induced hemorrhage and reversed tPA (6 h)-induced vascular damage and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 9 up-regulation. Twice administrations of P6Q at 2 h alone and 6 h with tPA significantly improved motor dysfunction more than 7 days. In photochemically induced thrombosis ischemia, similar vascular leakage and neuronal damage (infarction and motor dysfunction) by late tPA (4. or 6 h) were also inhibited by P6Q. Thus, these studies suggest that co-administration with ProTα or P6Q would be beneficial to inhibit delayed tPA-induced hemorrhagic mechanisms in acute ischemic stroke.© 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31452737>Identification of key genes and pathways between type I and type II endometrial cancer using bioinformatics analysis.</a></h1><p>Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is a common malignant neoplasm of the female reproductive tract. The malignant degree of type II EC is much greater than that of type I EC, usually presenting with a high recurrence rate and a poor prognosis. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the principal genes associated with the degree of differentiation in type I and type II EC and reveal their potential mechanisms. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected from the gene expression profiles derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were conducted. In the present study, the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that ,962 upregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in the 'p53 signaling pathway' and involved in 'lysine degradation'. In addition, 3,709 downregulated DEGs were enriched in 'pathways in cancer', as well as ' regulation', the 'cell cycle' and the 'Wnt signaling pathway'. The 13 top hub genes MAPK1, PHLPP1, ESR1, MDM2, CDKN2A, CDKN1A, AURKA, BCL2L1, POLQ, PIK3R3, RHOQ, EIF4E and LATS2 were identified via the protein-protein interaction network. Furthermore, the OncoPrint algorithm from cBioPortal declared that 25% of EC cases carried genetic alterations. The altered DEGs (MAPK1, MDM2, AURKA, EIF4E and LATS2) may be involved in tumor differentiation and may be valuable diagnostic biomarkers. In conclusion, a number of principal genes were identified in the present study that may be determinants of poorly differentiated type II EC carcinogenesis, which may contribute to future research into potential molecular mechanisms. In addition, these genes may help identify candidate biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets for type II EC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31147734>Pharmacological restoration of gut barrier function in stressed neonates partially reverses long-term alterations associated with maternal separation.</a></h1><p>Intestinal permeability plays an important role in gut-brain axis communication. Recent studies indicate that intestinal permeability increases in neonate pups during maternal separation (MS).The present study aims to determine whether pharmacological inhibition of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which regulates  contraction and controls intestinal permeability, in stressed neonates, protects against the long-term effects of MS.Male Wistar rats were exposed to MS (3 h per day from post-natal day (PND)2 to PND14) or left undisturbed and received daily intraperitoneal injection of a MLCK inhibitor (ML-7,  mg/kg) or vehicle during the same period. At adulthood, emotional behaviors, corticosterone response to stress, and gut microbiota composition were analyzed.ML-7 restored gut barrier function in MS rats specifically during the neonatal period. Remarkably, ML-7 prevented MS-induced sexual reward-seeking impairment and reversed the alteration of corticosterone response to stress at adulthood. The effects of ML-7 were accompanied by the normalization of the abundance of members of Lachnospiraceae, Clostridiales, Desulfovibrio, Bacteroidales, Enterorhabdus, and Bifidobacterium in the feces of MS rats at adulthood.Altogether, our work suggests that improvement of intestinal barrier defects during development may alleviate some of the long-term effects of early-life stress and provides new insight on brain-gut axis communication in a context of stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536448>Effects of Bread Yeast Cell Wall Beta-Glucans on Mice with Loperamide-Induced Constipation.</a></h1><p>Constipation is a common gastrointestinal disorder characterized by changes in intestinal habits. Increasing evidence indicates that long-term use of irritant laxatives causes serious side effects. Meanwhile, more than 50% of patients are dissatisfied with sense of use of non-prescriptional laxatives. -glucans are natural polysaccharides widely found in yeast, fungus, and plants, which have been reported to exhibit various pharmacological effects. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of -glucans extracted from the bread yeast cell wall on loperamide-induced constipation mice. Forty mice were fed with loperamide (10 mg/kg) to make the constipation model and a diet supplemented with 2., , and 10 mg/kg -glucan. We assessed the defecation frequency, intestinal transit function of mice, as well as used high-throughput sequencing to analyze the intestinal microbiota composition and functional biological profiles data. Meanwhile, we detected expression of neurotransmitters including acetylcholinesterase, substance P, and serotonin (-HT) and expression of  protein (TJP) including zonula occludens-1 and mucin-2 in distal colon to characterize the possible molecular mechanisms. -glucans significantly enhanced intestinal motility and provided a possibility to regulate the expression of neurotransmitters and TJP in mice. The intestinal microecological portion of the treatment group partially recovered and was closer to the normal group. This study showed that -glucans can influence the intestinal microbiota and restore microecological balance to regulate the express of neurotransmitters and TJP to recover intestinal epithelial mechanical barrier.

Depending on PF type (i.e. no addition, viable, inactivated) and AV addition (no/yes), 450 one-day-old Cobb male broilers were allocated in 6 treatments (CON, CON + A, ViP, ViP + A, InP and InP + A) according to a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement with  replicates of 15 broilers each for 42 days. Significant interactions (P  ≤ 0.05) between PF and AV administration were shown for the ileal mucosa-associated bacteria, the caecal digesta Lactobacillus spp., the molar ratio of the sum of valeric, hexanoic and heptanoic acids and the gene expressions of ileal and caecal IgA and ileal claudin 1. Avilamycin suppressed ileal digesta Lactobacillus spp. (P  < 0.001) and caecal digesta Clostridium perfringens subgroup (P  = 0.018) and modulated the intestinal fermentation intensity and pattern. The viable PF had the higher levels of ileal digesta Bacteroides spp. (P  = 0.021) and caecal digesta Lactobacillus spp. (P  = 0.038) compared with the other two PF. Probiotic form modulated the microbial metabolic activity in the ileum and caeca with the viable PF being the most noteworthy in terms of effects regarded as beneficial. Furthermore, the viable PF resulted in reduced expression of caecal Toll-like receptors TLR2B (P  = 0.026) and TLR4 (P  = 0.011) and transcription factor NFΚΒ1 (P  = 0.002), which could be considered as essential for limiting inflammation and preserving gut homeostasis. In conclusion, under non-challenge conditions, probiotic function was shown to depend on PF type and to a lesser degree on co-administration with AV.

Mice in vitamin D vehicle+ sham injury group and vitamin D vehicle+ burn injury group were injected with vehicle of vitamin D at a dose of 0.1 mL intraperitoneally at 1, 24, and 48 h before burn experiment. Mice in vitamin D+ sham injury group and vitamin D+ burn injury group were injected with vitamin D at a dose of 100 ng/kg dissolved in 0.1 mL vehicle intraperitoneally at the same time points. Mice in vitamin D vehicle+ burn injury group and vitamin D+ burn injury group were inflicted with 30% total body surface area full-thickness dermal scald (hereinafter referred to as burn) on the back by 98 ℃ hot water for 3 to 4 seconds. And mice in vitamin D vehicle+ sham injury group and vitamin D+ sham injury were treated with 37 ℃ water on the back for 3 to 4 seconds to simulate injury. Seven mice in vitamin D vehicle+ sham injury group and seven mice in vitamin D+ sham injury group at post injury hour (PIH) 24, and seven mice in vitamin D vehicle+ burn injury group and seven mice in vitamin D+ burn injury group at PIH 6 and 24 were sacrificed respectively to collect mesentery lymph nodes, spleens, livers, and intestinal tissue. The mesentery lymph nodes, spleens, and livers of mice in each group were collected to observe growth of bacteria, and number of bacteria was counted. Intestinal tissue of mice in each group was collected to detect protein expressions of zonal occludin 1 (ZO-1) and occludin by immunohistochemistry staining method, distribution of ZO-1 by immunofluorescence staining method, and expression of occludin by Western blotting. Data were processed with Kruskal-Wallis  test, Nemenyi test, one-way analysis of variance,  test, and Bonferroni correction.  (1) At PIH 6 and 24, bacterial counts of mesentery lymph nodes, livers, and spleens of mice in vitamin D vehicle+ burn injury group were significantly higher than those of mice in vitamin D vehicle+ sham injury group (<0.05). At PIH 6, bacterial counts of livers and spleens of mice in vitamin D+ burn injury group were significantly lower than those of mice in vitamin D vehicle+ burn injury group (<0.05). At PIH 24, bacterial counts of mesentery lymph nodes and livers of mice in vitamin D+ burn injury group were significantly lower than those of mice in vitamin D vehicle+ burn injury group (<0.05). (2) At PIH 6 and 24, expressions of ZO-1 and occludin of intestinal tissue of mice in vitamin D vehicle+ burn injury group were significantly lower than those of mice in vitamin D vehicle+ sham injury group, and expressions of ZO-1 and occludin of intestinal tissue of mice in vitamin D+ burn injury group were close to those of mice in vitamin D+ sham injury group. At PIH 6 and 24, expressions of ZO-1 and occludin of intestinal tissue of mice in vitamin D+ burn injury group were significantly higher than those of mice in vitamin D vehicle+ burn injury group. (3) At PIH 6 and 24, compared with that of mice in vitamin D vehicle+ sham injury group, distribution of ZO-1 of intestinal mucosal epithelium of mice in vitamin D vehicle+ burn injury group was discontinuous. Distribution of ZO-1 of intestinal mucosal epithelium of mice in vitamin D+ sham injury group was normal, and the distribution of ZO-1 of intestinal mucosal epithelium of mice in vitamin D+ burn injury group was with good continuity. (4) At PIH 6 and 24, expressions of occludin of intestinal tissue of mice in vitamin D vehicle+ burn injury group were 0.720±0.003, 0.638±0.052 respectively, significantly lower than 0.918±0.003 of mice in vitamin D vehicle+ sham injury group (=57.33, .36, <0.05). At PIH 6 and 24, expressions of occludin of intestinal tissue of mice in vitamin D+ burn injury group were 0.994±0.058, 1.064±0.060, close to 0.938±0.023 of mice in vitamin D+ sham injury group (=0.91, 1.96, >0.05). At PIH 6 and 24, expressions of occludin of intestinal tissue of mice in vitamin D vehicle+ burn injury group were significantly lower than those of mice in vitamin D+ burn injury group (=4.75, .35, <0.05).  Intestinal bacterial translocation can occur in the early stage of severe burn. And vitamin D plays a protective role in the intestinal mucosal barrier post severe burn to reduce the bacterial translocation by protecting  proteins of intestinal epithelium.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30999045>Post-irradiation recovery time strongly influences fractional laser-facilitated skin absorption.</a></h1><p>Fractional CO laser treatment has been used in some clinical trials to promote topical drug delivery. Currently, there is no standard for laser settings to achieve a feasible therapy. The cutaneous recovery following laser treatment and its influence on drug absorption have not been well explored. This study evaluated the kinetics of laser-treated skin-barrier restoration and drug permeation in nude mice. The skin recovery and observation of the process were characterized by transdermal water loss (TEWL), erythema measurement, gross appearance, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The skin absorption of a lipophilic small permeant (tretinoin), a hydrophilic small permeant (acyclovir), and a large molecule (fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran 4 kDa, FD4) was examined in vitro using Franz cell. TEWL suggested that the laser-treated skin restored its barrier function at 16 h after irradiation. The fractional laser produced microchannels of about 150 μm in diameter and 25 μm in depth that were surrounded with thermal coagulation. The bright-field imaging indicated that the micropores were progressively closed during the recovery period but had not completely closed even after a 16-h recovery. The laser treatment led to a rapid tretinoin penetration across the skin immediately after irradiation, with a -fold enhancement compared to intact skin. This enhancement was gradually reduced following the increase of recovery time. Conversely, the acyclovir and FD4 permeation peaked at 1-2 h post-irradiation. The FD4 flux was even elevated as the recovery time increased. The reasons for this could have been the subsequent inflammation after laser exposure and the deficient  (TJ) barrier. The confocal imaging demonstrated the perpendicular diffusion of rhodamine B and FD4 through microchannels immediately after laser exposure. The lateral diffusion from the microchannels was observed at 2 h post-irradiation. Our results revealed a time-dependent recovery of skin permeation. The time frame for applying the drugs after laser irradiation was dependent upon the permeants and their various physicochemical properties.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Hyaluronan (HA) is a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan polymer produced in all vertebrates, and usually present at the high molecular weight (>10 Da). Low molecular weight HA has signaling properties, and fragments ~35 kDa size (HA35) have biological activity in eliciting epithelial β-defensins and  proteins, notably ZO1, important components of innate host defense arsenal of the gut barrier in preclinical models. Safety, tolerability, impact on metabolism, gut permeability, and microbiome composition in healthy human subjects were all evaluated prospectively. . Pharmaceutical grade HA35 (140 mg in water once daily for seven days), was administered orally to 20 healthy subjects (30.7 ± .6 years). Demographical, clinical, biochemical laboratory tests, metabolic function and stool microbiome composition were measured on Day 0, 8 and 28. . HA35 was tolerated well in all subjects with no serious adverse events in any subjects. No statistical differences in any of the measurements were seen among the study group over the course of the trial. In aggregate there were no changes in demographical, clinical, biochemical laboratory tests, and metabolic function or microbiome composition during the 28-day study. . Oral HA35 administration (140 mg/day) is a safe treatment in healthy individuals and does not affect metabolic, inflammatory or microbiome parameters.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629471>Blood vessel formation in cerebral organoids formed from human embryonic stem cells.</a></h1><p>Current cerebral organoid technology provides excellent in vitro models mimicking the structure and function of the developing human brain, which enables studies on normal and pathological brain; however, further improvements are necessary to overcome the problems of immaturity and dearth of non-parenchymal cells. Vascularization is one of the major challenges for recapitulating processes in the developing human brain. Here, we examined the formation of blood vessel-like structures in cerebral organoids induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in vitro. The results indicated that VEGF enhanced differentiation of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) without reducing neuronal markers in the embryonic bodies (EBs), which then successfully developed into cerebral organoids with open-circle vascular structures expressing an EC marker, CD31, and a  marker, claudin-, characteristic of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Further treatment with VEGF and Wnt7a promoted the formation of the outer lining consisting of pericyte-like cells, which surrounded the vascular tubes. RNA sequencing revealed that VEGF upregulated genes associated with tube formation, vasculogenesis, and the BBB; it also changed the expression of genes involved in brain embryogenesis, suggesting a role of VEGF in neuronal development. These results indicate that VEGF treatment can be used to generate vessel-like structures with mature BBB characteristics in cerebral organoids in vitro.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although succinate is known to regulate intestinal metabolism and immune function, its role in the protection of the intestinal epithelial barrier function and inflammation is poorly characterized. In this study, we evaluated the effects of succinate on intestinal epithelial barrier function and inflammation in pigs. Twenty-four growing pigs were distributed into three groups ( = 8) and received either a basal diet (control group) or the same diet supplemented with 0.1% succinate or 1% succinate. The diet supplemented with 1% succinate led to alterations in the intestinal morphology. We confirmed in vitro that  mM succinate treatment modulated intestinal epithelial permeability by increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in intestinal porcine epithelial cell (IPEC)-J2 cells. Furthermore, succinate treatment increased the abundance of  proteins claudin-1, zona occluden (ZO)-1, and ZO-2 in the jejunum in vivo and in vitro. In addition, dietary succinate supplementation promoted the expression of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-25, IL-10, IL-8, and IL-18 in the jejunum. Taken together, these data identify a novel role of succinate in the modulation of intestinal epithelial barrier function, which may be a nutritional target to improve gut health in animals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385550>A simple method for the isolation and detailed characterization of primary human proximal tubule cells for renal replacement therapy.</a></h1><p>The main physiological functions of renal proximal tubule cells in vivo are reabsorption of essential nutrients from the glomerular filtrate and secretion of waste products and xenobiotics into urine. Currently, there are several established cell lines of human origin available as in vitro models of proximal tubule. However, these cells appeared to be limited in their biological relevance, because essential characteristics of the original tissue are lost once the cells are cultured. As a consequence of these limitations, primary human proximal tubule cells constitute a suitable and a biologically more relevant in vitro model to study this specific segment of the nephron and therefore, these cells can play an important role in renal regenerative medicine applications. Here, we describe a protocol to isolate proximal tubule cells from human nephrectomies. We explain the steps performed for an in-depth characterization of the cells, including the study of markers from others segments of the nephron, with the goal to determine the purity of the culture and the stability of proteins, enzymes, and transporters along time. The human proximal tubule cells isolated and used throughout this study showed many proximal tubule characteristics, including monolayer organization, cell polarization with the expression of  and primary cilia, expression of proximal tubule-specific proteins, such as megalin and sodium/glucose cotransporter 2, among others. The cells also expressed enzymatic activity for dipeptidyl peptidase IV, as well as for gamma glutamyl transferase 1, and expressed transporter activity for organic anion transporter 1, P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance proteins, and breast cancer resistance protein. In conclusion, characterization of our cells confirmed presence of putative proximal tubule markers and the functional expression of multiple endogenous organic ion transporters mimicking renal reabsorption and excretion. These findings can constitute a valuable tool in the development of bioartificial kidney devices.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30983357>Large-Scale Quantitative Comparison of Plasma Transmembrane Proteins between Two Human Blood-Brain Barrier Model Cell Lines, hCMEC/D3 and HBMEC/ciβ.</a></h1><p>Transmembrane (TM) proteins localized at the plasma membrane, such as transporters and receptors, play important roles in regulating the selective permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The purpose of the present study was to clarify the differences in the expression levels of TM proteins in the plasma membrane between two established human BBB model cell lines, hCMEC/D3 and HBMEC/ciβ, in order to assist researchers in selecting the most appropriate cell line for particular purposes. We first confirmed that plasma membranes could be enriched sufficiently for a quantitative proteomics study by using the Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit provided by BioVision with a modified protocol. This method was applied to hCMEC/D3 and HBMEC/ciβ cells, and fractions were used for untargeted quantitative proteomics based on sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment-ion spectra. In the plasma membrane fractions, 345 TM proteins were quantified, among which 135 showed significant expression differences between the two cell lines. In hCMEC/D3 cells, amino acid transporters SNAT1, SNAT2, SNAT5, ASCT1, CAT1, and LAT1; adenosine '-triphosphate-binding cassette transporters P-gp and MRP4; and GLUT1 were more highly expressed. The transferrin receptor expression was also 4.56-fold greater in hCMEC/D3 cells. In contrast, HBMEC/ciβ cells expressed greater levels of IgG transporter neonatal Fc receptor, as well as  proteins PECAM1, JAM1, JAM3, and ESAM. Our results suggest that hCMEC/D3 cells have greater efflux transport, amino acid transport, and transferrin receptor-mediated uptake activities, whereas HBMEC/ciβ cells have greater IgG-transport activity and  integrity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946989>The chromatin remodeling protein BRM regulates the transcription of  proteins: Implication in breast cancer metastasis.</a></h1><p>Claudins are a group of cell  proteins that play versatile roles in cancer biology. Recent studies have correlated down-regulation of Claudins with augmented breast cancer malignancy and poor prognosis. The mechanism underlying repression of Claudin transcription in breast cancer cells is not well understood. Here we report that expression levels of Brahma (BRM) were down-regulated in triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-231) compared to the less malignant MCF-7 cells and in high-grade human breast cancer specimens compared to low-grade ones. TGF-β treatment in MCF-7 cells repressed BRM transcription likely through targeting C/EBPβ. BRM over-expression suppressed whereas BRM knockdown promoted TGF-β induced migration and invasion of MCF-7 cells. BRM down-regulation was accompanied by the loss of a panel of Claudins in breast cancer cells. BRM directly bound to the promoter region of Claudin genes via interacting with Sp1 and activated transcription by modulating histone modifications. Together, our data have identified a novel epigenetic pathway that links Claudin transcription to breast cancer metastasis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

These amoebae can cause granulomatous amoebic encephalitis and amoebic keratitis in humans. Proteases are considered virulence factors in pathogenic Acanthamoeba. The objective of this study was to evaluate the behavior of Acanthamoeba mauritaniensis, a nonpathogenic amoeba. We analyzed the cytopathic effect of A. mauritaniensis on RCE1( T5) and MDCK cells and compared it to that of Acanthamoeba castellanii. A partial biochemical characterization of proteases was performed in total crude extracts (TCE) and conditioned medium (CM). Finally, we evaluated the effect of proteases on  (TJ) proteins and the transepithelial electrical resistance of MDCK cells. The results showed that this amoeba can induce substantial damage to RCE1(5T5) and MDCK cells. Moreover, the zymograms and Azocoll assays of amoebic TCE and CM revealed different protease activities, with serine proteases being the most active. Furthermore, A. mauritaniensis induced the alteration and degradation of MDCK cell TJ proteins with serine proteases. After genotyping this amoeba, we determined that it is an isolate of Acanthamoeba genotype T4D. From these data, we suggest that A. mauritaniensis genotype T4D behaves similarly to the A. castellanii strain.Copyright © 2019.

The second hypothesis was that increasing dietary Ca increases plasma Ca concentration and downregulates abundance of genes related to Ca absorption (, , and ) in the duodenum, and  proteins (, , and ) in the duodenum and ileum.Twenty corn-soybean meal diets were formulated using a 4 ×  factorial design with diets containing 0.16%, 0.33%, 0.42%, or 0.50% STTD P, and 0.14%, 0.29%, 0.44%, 0.59%, or 0.74% STTD Ca. Six hundred and forty pigs (initial weight: 11.1 ± 1.4 kg) were allotted to 20 diets and  blocks in a randomized complete block design. On day 21, weights of pigs and feed left in feeders were recorded and blood, duodenal tissue, ileal mucosa, and the right femur were collected from 1 pig per pen. Abundance of mRNA was determined in duodenal and ileal tissue via quantitative RT-PCR. Data were analyzed using a response surface model.The predicted maximum ADG (614 g), G:F (0.65), and bone ash (11.68 g) was obtained at STTD Ca:STTD P ratios of 1.39:1, 1.25:1, and 1.66:1, respectively, when STTD P was provided at the requirement (0.33%). If dietary STTD P was below the requirement, increasing dietary Ca resulted in reduced ( < 0.05) ADG and G:F. However, if dietary STTD P was above the requirement, negative effects ( < 0.05) on ADG and G:F of increasing STTD Ca were observed only if dietary STTD Ca exceeded 0.6%. Plasma Ca concentration was positively affected by STTD Ca over the range studied (quadratic,  < 0.01) and negatively affected by increasing STTD P (linear,  < 0.01). There was a linear negative effect ( < 0.05) of STTD Ca on the abundance of , , , and  in duodenum, and  and  in ileum.The STTD Ca:STTD P ratio needed to maximize growth performance of 11- to 25-kg pigs is less than 1.40:1, if P is at the estimated requirement.

Compared with caseinate digest, glycated caseinate digest had similar amount of Lys and Arg but lower -NH (0.557 versus 0.508 mol/kg protein) and total amide (1.12 versus 1.05 mol/kg protein) contents, and contained glucosamine at .74 g/kg protein. Acrylamide damaged barrier function of IEC-6 cells efficiently, leading to increased paracellular permeability and lactate dehydrogenase release, decreased trans-epithelial electrical resistance, and destroyed . The two digests alleviated these barrier dysfunctions via reversing index values. Three cellular proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1) crucial to  were up-regulated by the two digests. Furthermore, glycated caseinate digest was always more effective than caseinate digest to improve cell barrier function. This oligochitosan glycation is thus desired, as it ensures glycated protein digest with higher potential to protect intestinal barrier function.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of inhibiting CLDN4 in pancreatic ductal carcinomas (PDC). We first examined 91 cases of human PDC by immunohistochemistry and found that CLDN4 expression was correlated with tumor invasion, nodal metastasis, and distant metastasis. Anti-CLDN4 extracellular domain antibody, previously established by us (4D3), inhibited the proliferation of MIA-PaCa-2 PDC cells and increased intracellular -fluorouracil (-FU) concentration with lowering transepithelial electrical resistance. Concurrent treatment of -FU and 4D3 resulted in synergistic inhibition of growth of MIA-PaCa-2 cells in nude mice. In addition, MIA-PaCa-2 cell tumors treated with full-dose folfirinox (FFX) decreased tumor diameters to 50%; however, 60% of mice were dead from adverse effects. In contrast, half-dose FFX concomitant with 4D3 treatment decreased tumors equivalent to full-dose FFX, but without the adverse effects. These findings suggest that targeting CLDN4 might increase the effectiveness and safety of anticancer drug therapy in PDC.© 2019 The Authors.

Shear stress in the retinal circulation is altered in patients with retinal vascular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, we aimed to study the effect of laminar shear stress on barrier properties and on the release of proinflammatory cytokines in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMEC). HRMEC were cultured in Ibidi flow chambers and exposed to laminar shear stress (0-50 dyn/cm) for 24-48 h.  distribution (ZO-1 and claudin-) and cytokine production were determined by immunofluorescence and ELISA, respectively. The chemotactic effect of conditioned media exposed to shear stress was determined by measuring lymphocyte transmigration in Transwells. We found that cells exposed to moderately low shear stress (1. and  dyn/cm) showed enhanced distribution of membrane ZO-1 and claudin- and decreased production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-8, CCL2, and IL-6 compared to static conditions and high shear stress values. Moreover, conditioned media from cells exposed to low shear stress, had the lowest chemotactic effect to recruit lymphocytes compared to conditioned media from cells exposed to static and high shear stress conditions. In conclusion, high shear stress and static flow, associated to impaired retinal circulation, may compromise the inner blood retinal barrier phenotype and barrier function in HRMEC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Glucose primarily moves from the blood to the ASL via paracellular movement, down its concentration gradient, across the . However, there is evidence that glucose can move transcellularly across epithelial cells. Using a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) sensor for glucose, we investigated intracellular glucose concentrations in airway epithelial cells and the role of hexokinases in regulating intracellular glucose concentrations in normo- and hyperglycaemic conditions. Our findings indicated that in airway epithelial cells (H441 or primary human epithelial cells HBEC) exposed to 5mM glucose (normoglycaemia), intracellular glucose concentration is in the mM range. Inhibition of facilitative glucose transport (GLUT) with Cytochalasin B reduced intracellular glucose concentration. When cells were exposed to 15mM glucose (hyperglycaemia), intracellular glucose concentration reduced. Airway cells expressed hexokinases 1, 2 and 3. Inhibition with 3-bromopyruvate decreased hexokinase activity by ~25% and elevated intracellular glucose concentration but levels remained in the mM range. Exposure to hyperglycaemia increased glycolysis, glycogen and sorbitol. Thus, glucose enters the airway cell via GLUT transporters and is then rapidly processed by hexokinase-dependent and hexokinase-independent metabolic pathways to maintain low intracellular glucose concentrations. We propose this prevents transcellular transport, aids the removal of glucose from the ASL and that the main route of entry for glucose into the ASL is via the paracellular pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593632>Obtaining Protein Association Energy Landscape for Integral Membrane Proteins.</a></h1><p>Integral membrane proteins are ubiquitous in biological cellular and subcellular membranes. Despite their significance to cell function, isolation of membrane proteins from their hydrophobic lipid environment and further characterization remains a challenge. To obtain insights into membrane proteins, computational approaches such as docking or self-assembly simulations have been used; however, the promise of these approaches has been limited due to the computational cost. Here we present a new approach called Protein AssociatioN Energy Landscape (PANEL) that provides an extensive and converged data set for all possible conformations of membrane protein associations using a combination of stochastic sampling and equilibration simulations. The PANEL method samples the rotational space around both interacting proteins to obtain the comprehensive interaction energy landscape. We demonstrate the versatility of the PANEL method using two distinct applications: (a) dimerization of claudin-  proteins in phospholipid bilayer membrane and (b) dimer and trimer formation of the Outer membrane protein F (OmpF) in the lipopolysaccharide-rich bacterial outer membrane. Both applications required only a fraction of simulation cost compared to self-assembly simulations. The method is robust as it can capture changes in protein-protein conformations caused by point mutations. Moreover, the method is versatile and independent of the molecular resolution (atomistic or coarse grain) or the choice of force field employed to compute the pair-interaction energies. The PANEL method is implemented in easy-to-use scripts that are available for download for general use by the scientific community to characterize any pair of interacting integral membrane proteins.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623029>Expression of Neurotrophic Factors,  Proteins, and Cytokines According to Irritable Bowel Syndrome Subtype and Sex.</a></h1><p>Emerging evidence shows that the mechanism of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is associated with neurotrophic factors and  proteins (TJPs) It is known that there are sex differences in the pathophysiology of IBS. The aim of the present study is to determine expression levels of neurotrophic factors, TJPs, and cytokines according to IBS subtype and sex.From 59 IBS (33 IBS-constipation, 21 IBS-diarrhea, and  IBS-mixed) and 36 control patients, colonic mucosa mRNA expression levels of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1), nerve growth factor (NGF), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and various TJPs were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Western blot was performed to determine levels of zonular occludens-1 (ZO-1). Serum levels of cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.TRPV1, GDNF, and NGF mRNA levels were significantly increased in those with IBS-constipation compared to those in controls (all  < 0.05). However, they showed no significant difference between those with IBS-diarrhea and controls. Expression level of TRPV1 correlated with that of GDNF ( = 0.741,  < 0.001) and NGF ( = 0.935,  < 0.001). ZO-1 RNA expression levels were lower (P = 0.021) in female IBS-diarrhea than those in controls, although they showed no significant differences between male IBS-diarrhea and controls. Serum IL-1β levels in female IBS were significantly higher than those of male IBS, especially in IBS-constipation ( < 0.001).Our results suggest that neurotrophic factors and IL-1β are closely related to IBS-constipation and that decrease of ZO-1 is an important factor in female with IBS-diarrhea.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169192>Constraint-induced movement therapy enhances angiogenesis and neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.</a></h1><p>Constraint-induced movement therapy after cerebral ischemia stimulates axonal growth by decreasing expression levels of Nogo-A, RhoA, and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) in the ischemic boundary zone. However, it remains unclear if there are any associations between the Nogo-A/RhoA/ROCK pathway and angiogenesis in adult rat brains in pathological processes such as ischemic stroke. In addition, it has not yet been reported whether constraint-induced movement therapy can promote angiogenesis in stroke in adult rats by overcoming Nogo-A/RhoA/ROCK signaling. Here, a stroke model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion. Seven days after stroke, the following treatments were initiated and continued for 3 weeks: forced limb use in constraint-induced movement therapy rats (constraint-induced movement therapy group), intraperitoneal infusion of fasudil (a ROCK inhibitor) in fasudil rats (fasudil group), or lateral ventricular injection of NEP1-40 (a specific antagonist of the Nogo-66 receptor) in NEP1-40 rats (NEP1-40 group). Immunohistochemistry and western blot assay results showed that, at 2 weeks after middle cerebral artery occlusion, expression levels of RhoA and ROCK were lower in the ischemic boundary zone in rats treated with NEP1-40 compared with rats treated with ischemia/reperfusion or constraint-induced movement therapy alone. However, at 4 weeks after middle cerebral artery occlusion, expression levels of RhoA and ROCK in the ischemic boundary zone were markedly decreased in the NEP1-40 and constraint-induced movement therapy groups, but there was no difference between these two groups. Compared with the ischemia/reperfusion group, modified neurological severity scores and foot fault scores were lower and time taken to locate the platform was shorter in the constraint-induced movement therapy and fasudil groups at 4 weeks after middle cerebral artery occlusion, especially in the constraint-induced movement therapy group. Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that fasudil promoted an immune response of nerve-regeneration-related markers (BrdU in combination with CD31 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule), Nestin, doublecortin, NeuN, and glial fibrillary acidic protein) in the subventricular zone and ischemic boundary zone ipsilateral to the infarct. After 3 weeks of constraint-induced movement therapy, the number of regenerated nerve cells was noticeably increased, and was accompanied by an increased immune response of  (claudin-), a pericyte marker (α-smooth muscle actin), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. Taken together, the results demonstrate that, compared with fasudil, constraint-induced movement therapy led to stronger angiogenesis and nerve regeneration ability and better nerve functional recovery at 4 weeks after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. In addition, constraint-induced movement therapy has the same degree of inhibition of RhoA and ROCK as NEP1-40. Therefore, constraint-induced movement therapy promotes angiogenesis and neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, at least in part by overcoming the Nogo-A/RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway.

Cell viability was estimated by cell counting kit-8 and cell apoptosis by flow cytometry. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. The expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, zonula occludens (ZO)-1, Beclin-1 and autophagy-related (atg)  mRNA was evaluated by quantitative PCR, and the expression of ZO-1, microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3B) I and, LC3B II protein by Western blot.LPS effectively inhibited cell viability and LC3B I expression and enhanced LC3B II, Beclin-1 and atg5 expressions in MLE-12 cells. In LPS-induced ARDS cell model, astragaloside IV up-regulated cell viability, SOD activity and ZO-1 and LC3B I expressions but down-regulated cell apoptosis, TNF-α, IL-6, LC3B II, Beclin-1 and atg5 expressions and LDH and MDA levels. 3-methyladenine promoted cell viability and ZO-1 expression, down-regulated Beclin-1 and atg5 expression, while Rapamycin (Rap) had an opposite effect. Astragaloside IV suppressed cell viability and ZO-1 expression after the Rap treatment.Astragaloside IV might suppress autophagy initiation directly or indirectly through suppressing the oxidative stress and inflammatory response, which further enhances the cell viability and  and reduces apoptosis in LPS-stimulated pulmonary endothelial ARDS cell model, thus exerting its therapeutic function in ARDS.© 2019 S.

(TJs) are essential to maintain intestinal integrity. L-Arginine has beneficial effects on gut functions. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that L-arginine regulates the TJ network by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, which in turn improves intestinal barrier functions under HS. IEC-6 cells and rat small intestines were used as experiment models of heat stress. AICAR and dorsomorphin were used to activate and inhibit the AMPK pathway, respectively. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, differential gene expression and KEGG pathway analysis, intestinal paracellular permeability, intestinal morphology, and expression of HSP and TJ proteins, and p-AMPK were determined. L-Arginine promoted cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis after heat exposure at an optimal concentration of  mmol. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes associated with the HSP family and TJs were elevated by L-arginine. According to KEGG pathway analysis, L-arginine activated the AMPK signaling pathway. In vivo, intestinal damage resulted in obvious morphological changes as well as apoptosis with TUNEL and caspase-3 staining under HS and dorsomorphin treatments. Furthermore, HS and dorsomorphin increased the serum D-lactate concentration, diamine oxidase activity, and mRNA expression level of MLCK (P < 0.05). In contrast, L-arginine and AICAR treatments reduced intestinal injury, maintained intestinal permeability, and increased the villus/crypt ratio under hyperthermia. L-Arginine had the same effect as AICAR both in vitro and in vivo, namely increasing p-AMPK protein expression. L-Arginine and AICAR also upregulated the mRNA expression level of HSP70 and HSP90, and downregulated mRNA expression of MLCK (P < 0.05). The protein expression levels of TJ proteins ZO-1 and claudin-1 were suppressed by heat stroke and dorsomorphin, but enhanced by L-arginine and AICAR. Our findings indicate that activation of AMPK signaling by L-arginine is associated with improved intestinal mucosal barrier functions by enhancing the expression of TJs in rat small intestines and IEC-6 cells during HS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31086953>Recent advances in intestinal alkaline phosphatase, inflammation, and nutrition.</a></h1><p>In recent years, much new data on intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) have been published, and major breakthroughs have been disclosed. The aim of the present review is to critically analyze the publications released over the last  years. These breakthroughs include, for example, the direct implication of IAP in intestinal  integrity and barrier function maintenance; chronic intestinal challenge with low concentrations of Salmonella generating long-lasting depletion of IAP and increased susceptibility to inflammation; the suggestion that genetic mutations in the IAP gene in humans contribute to some forms of chronic inflammatory diseases and loss of functional IAP along the gut and in stools; stool IAP as an early biomarker of incipient diabetes in humans; and omega-3 fatty acids as direct inducers of IAP in intestinal tissue. Many recent papers have also explored the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of IAP and other alkaline phosphatase (AP) isoforms in various experimental settings and diseases. Remarkably, nearly all data confirm the potent anti-inflammatory properties of (I)AP and the negative consequences of its inhibition on health. A simplified model of the body AP system integrating the IAP compartment is provided. Finally, the list of nutrients and food components stimulating IAP has continued to grow, thus emphasizing nutrition as a potent lever for limiting inflammation.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here we examine whether (deficit) schizophrenia is accompanied by leaky paracellular, transcellular, and vascular barriers in the gut and blood-brain barriers. We measured IgA responses to occludin, claudin-, E-cadherin, and β-catenin (paracellular pathway, PARA); talin, actin, vinculin, and epithelial intermediate filament (transcellular pathway, TRANS); and plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP, vascular pathway) in 78 schizophrenia patients and 40 controls. IgA responses to claudin-, E-cadherin, and β-catenin, the sum of the four PARA proteins, and the ratio PARA/TRANS were significantly higher in deficit schizophrenia patients than in nondeficit schizophrenia patients and controls. A large part of the variance in PHEMN (psychosis, hostility, excitation, mannerism, and negative) symptoms, psychomotor retardation, formal thought disorders, verbal fluency, word list memory, word list recall, and executive functions was explained by the PARA/TRANS ratio coupled with plasma IgA responses to Gram-negative bacteria, IgM to malondialdehyde, CCL-11 (eotaxin), IgA levels of the ratio of noxious to more protective tryptophan catabolites (NOX/PRO TRYCATs), and a plasma immune activation index. Moreover, IgA levels to Gram-negative bacteria were significantly associated with IgA to E-cadherin, β-catenin, and PLVAP, while IgA levels to claudin- were significantly predicted by IgA to E-cadherin, NOX/PRO TRYCAT ratio, Gram-negative bacteria, and CCL11. The phenomenology of the deficit syndrome is to a large extent explained by the cumulative effects of lowered natural IgM, breakdown of the paracellular and vascular pathways, increased bacterial translocation, peripheral immune-inflammatory responses, and indices of BBB breakdown.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570003>The comprehensive pathophysiological changes in a novel rat model of postinflammatory visceral hypersensitivity.</a></h1><p>So far, a comprehensive animal model that can mimic both the central and peripheral pathophysiological changes of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is lacking. Here, we developed a novel IBS rat model combining trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) (designated as TC-IBS) and compared it with the TNBS-induced and CUMS-induced models. TC-IBS showed a pronounced depression phenotype with increased corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor (CRHR)1 and CRHR2 expression at the frontal cortex and increased serum ACTH concentration. Visceral hypersensitivity (VH), as evidenced by colorectal distention (CRD) test, was highest in TC-IBS, accompanied by increased serum -hydroxytryptamine (-HT) level and colonic -HT receptor 3A (-HTR)/-HT receptor 2B expression, impaired  protein expression including occludin, zonula occludens-1, and phosphorylated myosin light chain. Palonosetron, a second generation of -HTR antagonist, alleviated VH significantly in TC-IBS. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that TNBS plus CUMS induced a significant disturbance of the gut microbiota. Cytokine profile analysis of TC-IBS model indicated an innate immune activation both in serum and colonic mucosa. Further, fecal microbiota transplantation improved VH and some pathophysiological changes in TC-IBS. In summary, we established a postinflammatory IBS model covering multifactorial pathophysiological changes, which may help to develop therapies that target specific IBS subtype.-Ma, J., Li, J., Qian, M., He, N., Cao, Y., Liu, Y., Wu, K., He, S.

IL-22 promotes S. aureus and S. pneumoniae host defense in the lung through epithelial integrity and induction of antimicrobial peptides and is inhibited by the soluble decoy receptor IL-22-binding protein (IL-22BP). Little is known about the effect of the IL-22/IL-22BP regulatory pathway on lung infection, and it has not been studied in the setting of super-infection. We exposed wild-type and IL-22BP mice to influenza A/PR/8/34 for 6 days prior to infection with S. aureus (USA300) S. pneumoniae. Super-infected IL-22BP mice had decreased bacterial burden and improved survival compared to controls. IL-22BP mice exhibited decreased inflammation, increased lipocalin 2 expression, and deletion of IL-22BP was associated with preserved epithelial barrier function with evidence of improved  stability. Human bronchial epithelial cells treated with IL-22Fc showed evidence of improved  compared to untreated cells. This study revealed that IL-22BP mice are protected during influenza, bacterial super-infection, suggesting that IL-22BP has a pro-inflammatory role and impairs epithelial barrier function likely through interaction with IL-22.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496949>Osmoregulation in Barnacles: An Evolutionary Perspective of Potential Mechanisms and Future Research Directions.</a></h1><p>Barnacles form a globally ubiquitous group of sessile crustaceans that are particularly common in the coastal intertidal. Several barnacle species are described as highly euryhaline and a few species even have the ability to colonize estuarine and brackish habitats below  PSU. However, the physiological and/or morphological adaptations that allow barnacles to live at low salinities are poorly understood and current knowledge is largely based on classical eco-physiological studies offering limited insight into the molecular mechanisms. This review provides an overview of available knowledge of salinity tolerance in barnacles and what is currently known about their osmoregulatory strategies. To stimulate future studies on barnacle euryhalinity, we briefly review and compare barnacles to other marine invertebrates with known mechanisms of osmoregulation with focus on crustaceans. Different mechanisms are described based on the current understanding of molecular biology and integrative physiology of osmoregulation. We focus on ion and water transport across epithelial cell layers, including transport mechanisms across cell membranes and paracellular transfer across  as well as on the use of intra- and extracellular osmolytes. Based on this current knowledge, we discuss the osmoregulatory mechanisms possibly present in barnacles. We further discuss evolutionary consequences of barnacle osmoregulation including invasion-success in new habitats and life-history evolution. Tolerance to low salinities may play a crucial role in determining future distributions of barnacles since forthcoming climate-change scenarios predict decreased salinity in shallow coastal areas. Finally, we outline future research directions to identify osmoregulatory tissues, characterize physiological and molecular mechanisms, and explore ecological and evolutionary implications of osmoregulation in barnacles.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30984353>Anti-inflammatory effect of Lycium barbarum on polarized human intestinal epithelial cells.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) has rapidly escalated in Asia (including Korea) due to increasing westernized diet patterns subsequent to industrialization. Factors associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are demonstrated to be one of the major causes of IBD. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of  () on ER stress.Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line and polarized Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cells were treated with crude extract of the  fruit (LF). Paracellular permeability was measured to examine the effect of  (TJ) integrity. The regulatory pathways of ER stress were evaluated in MEF knockout (KO) cell lines by qPCR for interleukin (IL) 6, IL8 and XBP1 spliced form (XBP1s). Immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP), XBP1s and CCAAT/enhancer-binding homologous protein (CHOP) expressions were measured by RT-PCR. Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy (SICM) at high resolution was applied to observe morphological changes after treatments.Exposure to LF extract strengthened the TJ, both in the presence and absence of inflammation. In polarized Caco-2 pretreated with LF, induction in the expression of proinflammatory marker IL8 was not significant, whereas ER stress marker XBP1s expression was significantly increased. In wild type (wt) MEF cells, IL6, CHOP and XBP1 spliced form were dose-dependently induced when exposed to 12.-50 µg/mL extract. However, absence of XBP1 or IRE1α in MEF cells abolished this effect.Results of this study show that LF treatment enhances the barrier function and reduces inflammation and ER stress in an IRE1α-XBP1-dependent manner. These results suggest the preventive effect of LF on healthy intestine, and the possibility of reducing the degree of inflammatory symptoms in IBD patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31044554>Epithelial dynamics in the epididymis: role in the maturation, protection, and storage of spermatozoa.</a></h1><p>Epithelial cells line the lumen of tubular organs and are key players in their respective functions. They establish a unique luminal environment by providing a protective barrier and by performing vectorial transport of ions, nutrients, solutes, proteins, and water. Complex intercellular communication networks, specific for each organ, ensure their interaction with adjacent epithelial and non-epithelial cells, allowing them to respond to and modulate their immediate environment. In the epididymis, several epithelial cell types work in a concerted manner to establish a luminal acidic milieu that is essential for the post-testicular maturation and storage of spermatozoa. The epididymis also prevents autoimmune responses against auto-antigenic spermatozoa, while ensuring protection against ascending and blood pathogens. This is achieved by a network of immune cells that are in close contact and interact with epithelial cells. This review highlights the coordinated interactions between spermatozoa, basal cells, principal cells, narrow cells, clear cells, and immune cells that contribute to the maturation, protection, selection, and storage of spermatozoa in the lumen of the epididymis.© 2019 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31209407>[Role and mechanism of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in the regulation of submandibular gland secretion].</a></h1><p>Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), including M1-M5 subtypes, are classic receptors in regulating water, ion, and solute transport in salivary gland. Our work focuses on the studies on the expression pattern and function of mAChR in the submandibular gland (SMG), and the underlying mechanism involved in the mAChR-regulated secretion, together with the effect of parasympathectomy on the salivary secretion. Microvascular autotransplantation of SMG into the temporal fossa provides a continuous and endogenous source of fluids, and is currently an effective method for treating severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca. By using RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence, our data demonstrated that the expression of M1 and M3 subtypes were decreased in latent period in rabbit SMG autotransplantation model, whereas carbachol stimulation promoted the salivary secretion, as well as M1 and M3 expressions. By contrast, mAChRs were hypersensitive in epiphora SMGs, whereas atropine gel and botulinum toxin A application significantly inhibited the hypersecretion in both animal models and patients. Furthermore, the possible intracellular signal molecules involved in the mAChR-modulated salivary secretion were explored. Activation of mAChR upregulated the expression of aquaporin  (AQP5), the main transporter that mediated water secretion through transcellular pathway, and led to AQP5 trafficking from lipid rafts to non-lipid microdomain. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) was involved in the mAChR-regulated AQP5 content. mAChR activation also modulated the expression, distribution, and function of  proteins, and increased paracellular permeability. ERK1/2/β-arrestin2/clathrin/ubiquitin signaling pathway was responsible for the mAChR-regulated downregulation of  molecule claudin-4. Cytoskeleton filamentous actin (F-actin) was also involved in the distribution and barrier function of epithelial . Besides, endothelial  were opened by mAChR agonist-evoked salivation in the mice. Furthermore, parasympathetic denervation increased resting salivary secretion in the long terminrats and minipigs. Taken together, our work demonstrated that mAChR regulated saliva secretion via transcellular and paracellular pathways in SMG epithelium as well as  opening in SMG endothelium. Modulation of mAChR might be a promising strategy to ameliorate SMG dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078722>Characterization of an intestine-specific GH receptor knockout (IntGHRKO) mouse.</a></h1><p>Growth hormone (GH) has been reported to enhance the intestinal barrier; as such, recombinant GH has been administered for several intestinal diseases. However, excess GH action has been implicated in increasing the risk of intestinal dysfunction. The goal of this study was to examine the direct effects of GH on the small and large intestines to clarify the role GH plays in intestinal function through the use of a mouse model.An intestinal epithelial-specific GH receptor (GHR) knockout (IntGHRKO) mouse line was generated using Cre-lox with the villin promoter driving Cre expression. The generated mice were characterized with respect to growth and intestinal phenotypes.IntGHRKO mice showed no significant changes in body length, weight, or composition compared to floxed controls. Male IntGHRKO mice had significantly shorter large intestines at 4 and 12 months of age. Intestinal barrier function was assessed by measuring the expression of  related genes, as well as levels of serum endotoxin and fecal albumin. Results showed sex differences as males had an increase in occludin levels but normal serum endotoxin and fecal albumin; while, females had changes in fecal albumin levels with normal occludin and serum endotoxin. Evaluation of glucose tolerance and fat absorption also showed sex differences as females were glucose intolerant, while males had impaired fat absorption. Histopathology revealed a trend towards decreased villus height in males, which could explain the sex difference in glucose homeostasis.Overall, the data demonstrate that disruption of GH on the intestinal epithelial cells modestly affects the intestinal gross anatomy, morphology, and function in a sex-specific manner.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of EB on the barrier function in the intestinal porcine epithelial cells J2 (IPEC-J2). The IPEC-J2 cells were inoculated into 96-well plates at a density of  × 10 cells per well for 100% confluence. The cells were cultured in the presence of EB at concentrations of 0, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20 mg/ml for 48 hr. Then, 0.10 mg/ml was selected as the suitable concentration for the estimation of transepithelial electric resistance (TEER) value, alkaline phosphatase activity, proinflammatory cytokines mRNA expression,  mRNA and protein expression. The results of this study indicated that the supplementation of EB in IPEC-J2 cells decreased cellular membrane permeability and mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-γ (INF-γ), and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The supplementation of EB in IPEC-J2 cells increased  protein expression and anti-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). In addition, the western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results indicated that EB significantly (p < 0.05) increased the mRNA and protein expression of intestinal  proteins, Claudin-3, Occludin, and Zonula Occludins protein-1 (ZO-1). Therefore, dietary supplementation of EB may increase intestinal barrier function,  protein expression, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and decrease proinflammatory cytokines synthesis in IPEC-J2 cells.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616513>Effect of ulinastatin combined with mild therapeutic hypothermia on intestinal barrier dysfunction following cardiopulmonary resuscitation in rats.</a></h1><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ulinastatin (UTI) alone or combined with mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH) on intestinal barrier dysfunction following cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in rats. A total of 25 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly organized into five groups: Sham; control; UTI; MTH; and the combined group. The latter four groups were induced with the asphyxiated cardiac arrest rat model and treated with different interventions. After 6 h of treatment, the intestinal tissues of the rats were examined by electron microscopy, and the levels of intestinal malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined. The results of the present study indicated that the target temperature had successfully been attained in MTH and the combined group, and the other three groups of rats all survived at a normal temperature. In the rats treated with UTI or MTH, the epithelial cells exhibited pathological changes in their  and epithelial cell surface microvilli compared with the sham group. In the rats treated with a combination of UTI and MTH, whilst the epithelial cells exhibited a few slight changes, including mitochondrial edema, they were largely similar to the normal epithelial cells. However, there were significant differences in the levels of MDA and SOD between the different treatment groups. UTI combined with MTH may serve a protective role by suppressing oxidative stress in the small intestinal mucosa following CPR in rats compared with either UTI or MTH treatment alone.Copyright: © Zhang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31426859>Response of the neurovascular unit to brain metastatic breast cancer cells.</a></h1><p>Therapeutic resistance of cerebral secondary tumours largely depends on unique aspects linked to the neurovascular unit, especially cerebral endothelial cells and astrocytes. By using advanced microscopy techniques, here we explored novel mechanisms related to the neurovascular unit during extravasation and proliferation of triple negative breast cancer cells in the brain. Metastatic mammary carcinoma cells arrested and elongated within one hour in cerebral microvessels, but their number decreased by almost 80% in the first two days. Interestingly, malignant cells induced vasoconstriction and development of intraluminal endothelial plugs, which isolated invading cells from the circulation. During diapedesis - which usually took place on day four and five after inoculation of the tumour cells - continuity of cerebral endothelial  remained intact, indicating migration of cancer cells through the transcellular pathway. In addition, metastatic cells induced formation of multiluminal vessels and claudin--positive endothelial blebs. However, even severe endothelial blebbing could be reversed and the vessel morphology was restored shortly after the tumour cells completed transendothelial migration. Similar to neuro-inflammatory leukocytes, tumour cells migrated not only through the endothelial layer, but through the glia limitans perivascularis as well. Nevertheless, along with the growth of metastatic lesions by co-option of pre-existing capillaries, astrocytes and astrocyte end-feet were gradually expelled from the vessels to the border of the tumour. Taken together, we identified previously unknown mechanisms involved in the reaction of brain resident cells to invading breast cancer cells. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the complex cross-talk between tumour cells and host cells in the brain, which is essential for the identification of new therapeutic targets in this devastating disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31335471>Protective effect of Saccharomyces boulardii on intestinal mucosal barrier of dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in mice.</a></h1><p>The effect and mechanism of Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb) in inflammatory bowel disease are unclear. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of Sb on intestinal mucosal barrier and intestinal flora in a colitis mouse model.Forty C57BL/6J male mice were randomly assigned to five groups: normal control group (A), pathologic control group (B), Sb treatment group (C), mesalazine treatment group (D), and Sb combined with mesalazine treatment group (E). Colitis was induced by the addition of 2.% (wt/vol) dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in the drinking water ad libitum for 7 days. The general condition, weight change, stool property, and bloody stool level of mice were observed to evaluate the disease activity index. The expression of zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin in intestinal tissue were measured by immunohistochemistry. The level of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-8 in plasma was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Inter-cellular  were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The feces and intestinal contents were collected sterilely, and intestinal flora was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing.Compared with group B, Sb reduced the disease activity index and histological score of group C (disease activity index: group B 2.708 ± 0.628, group C 1.542 ± 0.616, PBC = 0.005; histological score: group B 9.875 ± 3.271, group C 4.750 ± 1.832, PBC = 0.005) in DSS-induced colitis in mice.

Treatment with Sb preserved the  and ameliorated microvilli and inter-cellular space. Treatment with Sb also showed its own characteristics: a higher percentage of Bacteroidetes and a lower percentage of Firmicutes, with significant differences or a significant trend. The proportion of the S24-7 family was increased significantly in the Sb treatment group.Sb shows an anti-inflammatory effect and has a protective effect on the intestinal mucosal mechanical barrier.

The IL-17 cytokine family is well known to play important roles in the host defense against bacterial infections at the mucosa. Previously, we reported the potential role of IL-17A in clearing an ETEC infection in piglets. IL-17C, another member of the IL-17 family, is highly expressed in the intestinal epithelium, however, its role during an ETEC infection is still unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that F4 ETEC induce IL-17C mRNA and protein expression in intestinal tissues as well as in porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). This IL-17C production is largely dependent on TLR5 signaling in IPEC-J2 cells. Both F4 ETEC infection and exogenous IL-17C increased the expression of antimicrobial peptides and  proteins, such as porcine beta-defensin (pBD)-2, claudin-1, claudin-2 and occludin in IPEC-J2 cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that TLR5-mediated IL-17C expression in intestinal epithelial cells enhances mucosal host defense responses in a unique autocrine/paracrine manner in the intestinal epithelium against ETEC infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155249>The effects of cereal type and α-tocopherol level on milk production, milk composition, rumen fermentation, and nitrogen excretion of spring-calving dairy cows in late lactation.</a></h1><p>Grass-based production systems use concentrate supplementation primarily when pasture quality and availability have declined. Barley is a common concentrate ingredient; however, oat grain grows well in Ireland, is a source of lipids and fiber, and may provide an alternative to barley. The antioxidant α-tocopherol (α-TOC) plays a role in cell membrane structure, and it has the potential to improve  structures of the mammary gland that deteriorate in late lactation. The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of cereal type and α-TOC level on milk yield, milk composition, rumen fermentation, and N excretion in late-lactation dairy cows at pasture and when housed indoors on grass silage. Forty-eight Holstein Friesian dairy cows were blocked on days in milk (+185 d in milk) and balanced for parity, pre-experimental milk yield, milk composition, and body condition score and assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design (n = 12). The dietary treatments were control (C) base diet; base diet + barley-based concentrate + low α-TOC (350 IU/kg) (B); base diet + oat-based concentrate + low α-TOC (350 IU/kg) (O); and base diet + oat-based concentrate + high α-TOC (1,050 IU/kg) (O+T). Following a 14-d acclimation period, diets were offered for a 49-d experimental period at pasture (P1) and a 21-d experimental period indoors (P2). The base diet was grazed grass in P1 and grass silage in P2. In P2, cows on C also received 2.65 kg (dry matter) of a standard concentrate. In P1, supplementation increased milk and milk solids yield (B: 20.7 kg/d, 1.74 kg/d; O: 20.6 kg/d, 1.81 kg/d; O+T: 20. kg/d, 1.77 kg/d, respectively) compared with C (17.8 kg/d, 1.60 kg/d). Cows offered B had a lower milk fat (4.60%) concentration than C (.00%) and O (4.90%). In P2, cereal type and α-TOC level did not alter milk production.

Validating serum biomarkers for altered intestinal permeability in irritable bowel syndrome will facilitate research and pathophysiology-based therapy.To measure serum zonulin and intestinal fatty acid binding protein levels in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and compare with healthy controls and celiac disease.Serum zonulin and intestinal fatty acid binding protein levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome ( = 50), diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome ( = 50), celiac disease ( = 53) and healthy controls ( = 42). Irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity was measured using the irritable bowel syndrome-symptom severity scale.Patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome had higher zonulin levels compared with healthy controls ( = 0.006 and 0.009 respectively), which was comparable to those with active celiac disease. Although zonulin levels did not correlate with the overall irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity scale, it positively correlated with stool frequency per week ( = 0.03) and dissatisfaction with bowel habits ( = 0.007) in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome had lower intestinal fatty acid binding protein levels compared with celiac patients ( = 0.005 and  = 0.047 respectively).Serum zonulin is upregulated in irritable bowel syndrome and the levels are comparable to those in celiac disease. Zonulin levels correlated with severity of bowel habits in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Intestinal fatty acid binding protein levels in irritable bowel syndrome patients were not increased suggesting no significant increase in enterocyte death.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31286255>Is that 'floppy' fundoplication  enough?</a></h1><p>Laparoscopic fundoplication is the treatment of choice for medically refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Surgeons seek to create a competent valve at the gastroesophageal  (GEJ) but are careful to construct a 'floppy' fundoplication that is not too  to minimize side effects. The endoscopic functional luminal-imaging probe (EndoFLIP®) uses impedance planimetry to assess the GEJ intraoperatively. We sought to determine if EndoFLIP variables are associated with symptomatic outcomes following fundoplication.We conducted a retrospective review of prospectively maintained data on subjects who underwent primary laparoscopic fundoplication at a single institution between 2014 and 2018. All patients met standard indications for antireflux surgery. Minimum diameter (Dmin), cross-sectional area (CSA), intra-bag pressure, and distensibility index of the GEJ were obtained at 30 mL volumes. GERD Health Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL) surveys were administered pre- and postoperatively. Patients were excluded if they underwent fundoplication without EndoFLIP assessment or if they did not complete a postop GERD-HRQL survey. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine if EndoFLIP measurements were correlated with symptomatic outcomes.Forty-three patients met inclusion criteria. The change in Dmin and CSA measures during fundoplication were associated with daily or more frequent heartburn at 6 or more months postop. A decrease in Dmin of 0.15 mm or less (AUC = 0.718, sensitivity: 71%, specificity: 69%) and a decrease in CSA of 1. mm or less (AUC = 0.728, sensitivity: 71%, specificity: 70%) were associated with severe heartburn.GEJ opening dynamics attained by EndoFLIP appear to be associated with symptomatic outcomes. When the Dmin and CSA do not decrease by a defined threshold, heartburn is more likely to be severe at 6 or more months postoperatively. This suggests that the fundoplication may not be  enough to prevent persistent or recurrent GERD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425564>Effects of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) on barrier properties and mRNA transcript levels of selected marker proteins in brain endothelial cells/astrocyte co-cultures.</a></h1><p>Ischemic stroke has been shown to induce breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, although these changes are not fully characterized. Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) has been used to investigate the effects of ischemia in cultured brain capillary endothelial cells, however this involves a change of medium which in itself may affect the cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of OGD and simple medium exchange followed by 48 h of reperfusion on barrier properties of primary bovine endothelial cells co-cultured with rat astrocytes. Barrier properties were evaluated by transendothelial electrical resistance measurements, passive permeability of flux markers, RT-qPCR and immunocytochemistry. Both OGD and simple medium exchange caused an increase in endothelial monolayer permeability. This correlated with reduced transcript levels of a number of  and -associated proteins (claudin-1, claudin-, occludin, ZO-1, tricellulin, marveld3 and PECAM-1), as well as with altered transcript level of several transporters and receptors (GLUT-1, HB-EGF, InsR, TfR, two members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family, LDLR and LRP-1, and the efflux transporter BCRP). In contrast, effects induced specifically by OGD were transient de-localization of claudin- from the  zone, increased InsR localization at the plasma membrane and transient downregulation of MRP-1 and P-gp transcript levels. In conclusion, OGD caused changes in claudin- and InsR localization, as well as in MRP-1 and P-gp transcript levels. Our results however also indicated that medium exchange alone caused changes in functional barrier properties and expression levels of wide range of proteins.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31207213>Salvianolate lyophilized injection (SLI) strengthens blood-brain barrier function related to ERK1/2 and Akt signaling pathways.</a></h1><p>The salvianolate lyophilized injection (SLI) has been widely used for the treatment of acute cerebral infarction; however, the molecular mechanism of how it strengthens blood brain barrier (BBB) function is not well understood. Here, we investigated the effects of SLI on BBB function in bEnd.3 cells as well as in rats. In oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-damaged bEnd.3 cells, SLI increased transepithelial electrical resistance and decreased sodium fluorescein flux. SLI-treated cells showed increased expression of  proteins, including Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), Claudin- and Occludin. Furthermore, SLI led to the decrease of phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, and Akt. Using selective inhibitors, we found that the positive effects of SLI on barrier function were abolished in cells in which ERK1/2 and Ak signaling were inhibited. Moreover, in MCAO model rats, SLI effectively alleviated brain leakage of Evans blue, increased brain tissue ZO-1 expression and inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt. Overall, these data suggest that SLI strengthens BBB function was interrelated ERK1/2 and Akt signaling pathways in cerebral vascular diseases.Copyright © 2019.

The periphery (2.75 mm) of clinical-grade tissues (n = 15) deemed for preloaded DMEK transplants was gently peeled and preserved for 48 hours in tissue culture media, followed by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for  minutes. After enzymatic digestion, the cells from each group were plated in 2 different wells of an 8-well chamber slide. Media were refreshed and the confluence rate was monitored every alternate day. Live/dead staining and the expression of ZO-1, Tag1A3, Tag2A12, and Ki-67 markers were used to assess the viability, morphology, , cell area, and number of proliferative cells. The Wilcoxon and Student's t test were applied, where P < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant.Average endothelial cell density at confluence was 2,352 cells/mm2 from complete endothelium and 2,510 cells/mm from peripheral endothelium (P = 0.0351). The confluence rate (%), hexagonality (%), polymorphism (%), cell area (μm), and Ki-67 positivity (%) did not differ between both groups (P > 0.05). All the antibodies were expressed in both groups at confluence.The discarded peripheral endothelial cells obtained after preparing a preloaded DMEK graft for clinical application has a huge reservoir of healthy endothelial cells having proliferative potential. Using these discarded tissue pieces from donor tissues will significantly increase the primary source of healthy donor endothelial cells for regenerative treatments, which are otherwise difficult to obtain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384532>Aspirin alleviates endothelial gap  dysfunction through inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LPS-induced vascular injury.</a></h1><p>The loss of endothelial connective integrity and endothelial barrier dysfunction can lead to increased vascular injury, which is related to the activation of endothelial inflammasomes. There are evidences that low concentrations of aspirin can effectively prevent cardiovascular diseases. We hypothesized that low-dose aspirin could ameliorate endothelial injury by inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and ultimately prevent cardiovascular diseases. Microvascular endothelial cells were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (2 μg/mL) and administrated by 0.1-2 mmol/L aspirin. The wild type mice were stimulated with LPS (100 μg/kg/day), and 1 h later treated with aspirin (12., 62., or 125 mg/kg/day) and dexamethasone (0.0182 mg/kg/day) for 7 days. Plasma and heart were harvested for measurement of ELISA and immunofluorescence analyses. We found that aspirin could inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation  in dose-dependent manner and has correlation between the NLRP3 inflammasome and the ROS/TXNIP pathway. We also found that low-concentration aspirin could inhibit the formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and restore the expression of the endothelial  protein zonula occludens-1/2 (ZO1/2). We assume that aspirin can ameliorate the endothelial layer dysfunction by suppressing the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31248104>Impact of Maternal Malnutrition on Gut Barrier Defense: Implications for Pregnancy Health and Fetal Development.</a></h1><p>Small intestinal Paneth cells, enteric glial cells (EGC), and goblet cells maintain gut mucosal integrity, homeostasis, and influence host physiology locally and through the gut-brain axis. Little is known about their roles during pregnancy, or how maternal malnutrition impacts these cells and their development. Pregnant mice were fed a control diet (CON), undernourished by 30% vs. control (UN), or fed a high fat diet (HF). At day 18. (term = 19), gut integrity and function were assessed by immunohistochemistry and qPCR. UN mothers displayed reduced mRNA expression of Paneth cell antimicrobial peptides (AMP; ) and an accumulation of villi goblet cells, while HF had reduced  and mucin () mRNA and increased lysozyme protein. UN fetuses had increased mRNA expression of gut transcription factor , associated with reduced expression of maturation markers (, ), and increased expression of  (TJ; ). HF fetuses had increased mRNA expression of EGC markers (, , ), AMP (, , ), and TJ (, ), and reduced expression of an AMP-activator (). Maternal malnutrition altered expression of genes that maintain maternal gut homeostasis, and altered fetal gut permeability, function, and development.

Growth performance, blood cells and biochemical parameters, serum cytokines, intestinal morphology, , gut microbiota, and the metabolic profiles of the gut digesta were analyzed. The results showed that dietary supplementation with XOS had little effects on growth performance, blood cells and biochemical parameters, and intestinal morphology. However, the inflammatory status and intestinal barrier were improved in XOS-fed piglets evidenced by the reduction of IFN-γ and upregulation of ZO-1. Microbiota analysis showed that XOS enhanced α-diversity and affected the relative abundances of Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Turicibacter at the genus level. The alterations in the microbiota might be further involved in carbohydrate metabolism, cell motility, cellular processes and signaling, lipid metabolism, and metabolism of other amino acids by functional prediction. A metabolomics study identified three differentiated metabolites, including coenzyme Q6, zizyphine A, and pentadecanal, which might be produced by the microbiota and further affect host metabolism. In conclusion, dietary XOS improved the inflammatory status, gut barrier, and microbiota communities, which might be used as a potential feed additive to prevent gut dysfunction caused by weaning in the pig industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061329>An Openable Artificial Intestinal Tract System Enables the Evaluation of Drug Absorption in Caco-2 Cells through the Reduction in Thickness of the Unstirred Water Layer.</a></h1><p>In drug absorption and permeability experiments, an unstirred water layer (UWL) is known to cause differences in the estimated permeability of drugs between in vitro and in vivo experiments. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new method to allow for accurate measurements of in vitro drug absorption through the reduction of the UWL effect. Previously, we have developed an artificial intestinal tract that mimics the tubular structure of the human intestine and enables study of drug absorption under flow conditions. In order to determine whether our artificial intestinal tract has the potential to reduce the effect of a UWL on drug absorption, the present study evaluated drug absorption in Caco-2 cells using this artificial system. The viability and  structure of Caco-2 cells on the artificial intestinal tract were intact during perfusion. The cumulative amount of the highly lipophilic drugs imipramine and chlorpromazine accumulated in Caco-2 cells cultured on the cell culture plate was 1. times higher under mechanical agitation, whereas that of cells on the artificial intestinal tract was 6. times higher when internal flow was applied. In addition, the cumulative amounts of -aminosalicylic acid and clonidine, drugs with low lipophilicity, accumulated in Caco-2 cells on the artificial intestinal tract were unchanged by internal flow. These results indicate that the artificial intestinal tract enables effective reduction of the UWL thickness at the Caco-2 cell-surface, and allows evaluation of in vitro drug absorption under conditions similar to those found in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313075>Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor type 1 antagonist montelukast protects against injury of blood-brain barrier.</a></h1><p>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is formed by tightly connected cerebrovascular endothelial cells. Injury of human brain endothelial cells can cause disruption of the BBB and severe injury to brain tissue. Signals mediated cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) and their receptors are involved in a variety of pathological conditions. In the current study, our results show that oxygen glucose-deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) induced the expression of leukotriene receptor type 1 (cysLT1R) in brain endothelial cells. Blockage of cysLT1R by its specific antagonist montelukast suppressed OGD/R-induced altered permeability of the human brain endothelial cell (EC) monolayer. Mechanistically, montelukast treatment reversed OGD/R-induced reduction of the  proteins occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Montelukast also ameliorated OGD/R-induced reduction of inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs), such as TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. On the other hand, montelukast suppressed the expression and production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cytokines including MMP-2, MMP-9, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Using a murine middle cerebral artery occlusion brain injury model, we demonstrated that the administration of montelukast improved the surgery-induced brain injury and protected against disruption of brain endothelial  proteins such as occludin and ZO-1. Collectively, our data suggest that montelukast might confer protective roles against injury in brain endothelial cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620112>Selective Disruption of the Blood-Brain Barrier by Zika Virus.</a></h1><p>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) selectively regulates the cellular exchange of macromolecules between the circulation and the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we hypothesize that Zika virus (ZIKV) infects the brain via a disrupted BBB and altered expression of  (TJ) proteins, which are structural components of the BBB. To assess this hypothesis,  and  studies were performed using three different strains of ZIKV: Honduras (ZIKV-H), Puerto Rico (ZIKV-PR), and Uganda (ZIKV-U). Primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were productively infected by all studied ZIKV strains at MOI 0.01, and were analyzed by plaque assay, immunofluorescence for NS1 protein, and qRT-PCR at 2 and 6 days post-infection (dpi). Compared to mock-infected controls, expression level of ZO-1 was significantly upregulated in ZIKV-H-infected BMECs, while occludin and claudin- levels were significantly downregulated in BMECs infected by all three studied viral strains. Interestingly, BMEC permeability was not disturbed by ZIKV infection, even in the presence of a very high viral load (MOI 10). All studied ZIKV strains productively infected wild-type C57BL/J mice after intravenous infection with 10 PFU. Viral load was detected in the plasma, spleen, and brain from 1 to 8 dpi. Peak brain infection was observed at 2 dpi; therefore, TJ protein expression was assessed at this time point. Claudin- was significantly downregulated in ZIKV-U-infected animals and the BBB integrity was significantly disturbed in ZIKV-H-infected animals. Our results suggest that ZIKV penetrates the brain parenchyma early after infection with concurrent alterations of TJ protein expression and disruption of the BBB permeability in a strain-dependent manner.Copyright © 2019 Leda, Bertrand, Andras, El-Hage, Nair and Toborek.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31077946>Anti-Claudin-1 Conjugated to a Near-Infrared Fluorophore Targets Colon Cancer in PDOX Mouse Models.</a></h1><p>Claudins are  proteins, which maintain an epithelial barrier in normal colon cells.

Seizures are associated with poor long-term outcomes and increased neuropathology. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and inflammation may contribute to seizures and increased neuropathology but are incompletely understood in neonatal HIE. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of seizures on BBB integrity in a preclinical model of neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic (HI) injury. Piglets (age: <24 h) were subjected to a 30-min HI insult followed by recovery to 72 h post-insult. Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) was performed and seizure burden and background aEEG pattern were analysed. BBB disruption was evaluated in the parietal cortex and hippocampus by means of immunohistochemistry and Western blot. mRNA and protein expression of  proteins (zonula-occludens 1 [ZO1], occludin [OCLN], and claudin- [CLDN5]) was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot. In addition, mRNA from genes associated with BBB disruption vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) as well as inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was assessed with qPCR. Piglets that developed seizures following HI (HI-Sz) had significantly greater injury, as demonstrated by poorer aEEG background pattern scores, lower neurobehavioural scores, and greater histopathology. HI-Sz animals had severe IgG extravasation into brain tissue and uptake into neurons as well as significantly greater levels of IgG in both brain regions as assessed by Western blot. IgG protein in both brain regions was significantly associated with seizure burden, aEEG pattern scores, and neurobehavioural scores. There was no difference in mRNA expression of the , however a significant loss of ZO1 and OCLN protein was observed in the parietal cortex. The inflammatory genes TGFβ, IL1β, IL8, IL6, and TNFα were significantly upregulated in HI-Sz animals. MMP2 was significantly increased in animals with seizures compared with animals without seizures. Increasing our understanding of neuropathology associated with seizure is vital because of the association between seizure and poor outcomes.

The increasing incidence from 10% up to 40% is due to more effective treatments of extracerebral sites with improved prognosis and increasing use of MRI in diagnostics. A frequently administered, potent chemotherapeutic group of drugs for BC treatment are taxanes usually used in the adjuvant and metastatic setting, which, however, have been suspected to be associated with a higher incidence of BM. The aim of our study was to experimentally analyze the impact of the taxane docetaxel (DTX) on brain metastasis formation, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism.A monocentric patient cohort was analyzed to determine the association of taxane treatment and BM formation. To identify the specific impact of DTX, a murine brain metastatic model upon intracardial injection of breast cancer cells was conducted. To approach the functional mechanism, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and electron microscopy of mice as well as in-vitro transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and tracer permeability assays using brain endothelial cells (EC) were carried out. PCR-based, immunohistochemical and immunoblotting analyses with additional RNA sequencing of murine and human ECs were performed to explore the molecular mechanisms by DTX treatment.Taxane treatment was associated with an increased rate of BM formation in the patient cohort and the murine metastatic model. Functional studies did not show unequivocal alterations of blood-brain barrier properties upon DTX treatment in-vivo, but in-vitro assays revealed a temporary DTX-related barrier disruption. We found disturbance of tubulin structure and upregulation of  marker claudin- in ECs. Furthermore, upregulation of several members of the tubulin family and downregulation of tetraspanin-2 in both, murine and human ECs, was induced.In summary, a higher incidence of BM was associated with prior taxane treatment in both a patient cohort and a murine mouse model. We could identify tubulin family members and tetraspanin-2 as potential contributors for the destabilization of the blood-brain barrier. Further analyses are needed to decipher the exact role of those alterations on tumor metastatic processes in the brain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425367>Alanyl-glutamine heals indomethacin induced gastric ulceration in rats via anti-secretory and anti-apoptotic mechanisms.</a></h1><p>Alanyl-glutamine (AG) is a dipeptide that fuels enterocytes and has a co-adjuvant role during gut healing. The current study aimed to investigate the potential ulcer-healing effect of AG in indomethacin-induced gastropathy.Animals (n = 10 rats/group) were randomly allocated into  groups. Gastric ulcerated rats were administered AG, AG + dexamethasone (DEXA), or pantoprazole post indomethacin exposure.Comparable to pantoprazole, AG inhibited H-KATPase pump and elevated the pH of gastric juice. Moreover, the dipeptide increased the serum/mucosal contents of GLP-1, pS473-Akt, and cyclin-D1. On the other hand, AG abated serum TNF-α and gastric mucosal content of pS45-β catenin, pS9-GSK3β, pS133-CREB, pS536-NF-κB, H2O2, claudin-1, and caspase-3. The administration of DEXA prior to AG hampered its effect on almost all the measured parameters.AG confers its anti-ulcerogenic/anti-secretory potentials by repressing the proton pump to increase the gastric juice pH via boosting p-CREB, p-Akt, p-GSK-3β, and GLP-1. Also, it inhibits apoptosis through suppressing NF-κB/TNF-α/H2O2/claudin-1 cue. This trajectory contributes to loosen the  priming AG-mediated GLP-1/β-catenin/cyclin-D1 that results in pronounced increase in gastric mucosa proliferation. Therefore, the crosstalk between multiple pathways orchestrates the action of AG against gastric ulceration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035432>Grape-Seed Proanthocyanidins are Able to Reverse Intestinal Dysfunction and Metabolic Endotoxemia Induced by a Cafeteria Diet in Wistar Rats.</a></h1><p>We evaluated the effectiveness of pharmacological doses of grape-seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) in reversing intestinal barrier alterations and local inflammation in female Wistar rats fed a long-term obesogenic diet. Animals were fed a 17-week cafeteria diet (CAF diet), supplemented with daily GSPE doses (100 or 500 mg kg body weight) during the final two weeks. CAF diet enhanced the intestinal permeation of an orally administered marker (ovalbumin, OVA) and increased the plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in 2-3-fold. Ex vivo Ussing chamber assays showed a 55-70% reduction in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and increased the TNF-α secretions in both small and large intestinal sections with a 25-fold increment in the ileum. Ileal tissues also presented a 4-fold increase of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Both GSPE-treatments were able to restitute TEER values in the ileum and colon and to reduce plasma LPS to basal levels without a dose-dependent effect. However, effects on the OVA permeation and TNF-α secretion were dose and section-specific. GSPE also reduced ileal MPO activity and upregulated claudin 1 gene expression. This study provides evidence of the efficacy of GSPE-supplementation ameliorating diet-induced intestinal dysfunction and metabolic endotoxemia when administered at the end of a long-term obesogenic diet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31171270>Modified Da-chai-hu Decoction regulates the expression of occludin and NF-κB to alleviate organ injury in severe acute pancreatitis rats.</a></h1><p>Modified Da-chai-hu Decoction (MDD), a traditional Chinese medicinal formulation, which was empirically generated from Da-chai-hu decoction, has been utilized to treat severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) for decades. The aim of the present study was to explore its potential organprotective mechanism in SAP. In the present study, rat SAP model was induced by retrograde injection of 3.% sodium taurocholate into the biliopancreatic duct, MDD (23.35 g/kg body weight, twelve times the clinical dose) were orally given at 2 h before and 10 h after injection. At 12 h after model induction, blood was taken from vena cava for analysis of amylase, diamine oxidase (DAO), pulmonary surfactant protein-A (SP-A), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Histopathological change of pancreas, ileum and lung was assayed by H&E staining, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were determinated using colorimetric assay, and the expressions of occludin and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were detected by real-time RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. In addition, the tissue concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that in SAP rats, MDD significantly alleviated histopathological damage, depressed the MPO activity and the concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, and MCP-1 of pancreas, ileum and lung, and reduced the serum levels of amylase [(3283.4 ± 585.)

However, the serum SP-A concentration [(106.1 ± 16.6) pg·mLvs (90.1 ± 14.9) pg·mL] was elevated when treated SAP rats with MDD. Furthermore, MDD increased the occludin expression and reduced the NF-κB expression in pancreas, ileum and lung of SAP rats. Our findings suggested that MDD administration was an effective therapeutic approach for SAP treatment. It could up-regulate occludin expression to protect intercellular  and down-regulate NF-κB expression to inhibit inflammatory reaction of pancreas, ileum and lung.Copyright © 2019 China Pharmaceutical University.

The other eye was untreated. Rabbit eyes were kept open for 2 h to induce acute corneal desiccation. The extent of fluorescein corneal staining was evaluated using EpiView software and the concentration of fluorescein in the anterior chamber was determined by a fluorometer. Safety was evaluated by electroretinogram, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and histopathology. Expression pattern of corneal cell markers was determined by immunofluorescence.A significant decrease in fluorescein concentration in the anterior chamber (146. ± 18.6 ng/ml vs. 54 ± 8.4 ng/ml p = 0.000001) and in corneal surface fluorescein staining score (1.7 ± 0.2 vs. 4.6 ± 0.6, p = 0.00001) was obtained in RMS-treated eyes compared with control eyes, respectively. RMS treatment reduced by nearly 4 fold the percentage of corneal area with epithelial erosions by Anterior segment OCT. The therapeutic effect was maintained for at least 3 months. Increased expression of epithelial  protein Zo-1 was observed in treated eyes. SD-OCT and histopathology analysis revealed no pathological changes in the treated or non-treated eyes.RMS treatment decreases epithelial corneal erosions in a rabbit model of exposure keratopathy, with no indication of pathological changes. RMS may present a novel treatment for protection of corneal epithelium from desiccation.Copyright © 2019.

We investigated whether  MG1655, an  commensal organism, increased intestinal injury and aggravated ANP in rats. ANP was induced by retrograde injection of 3.% sodium taurocholate into the biliopancreatic duct. Using gut microbiota-depleted rats, we demonstrated that gut microbiota was involved in the pancreatic injury and intestinal barrier dysfunction in ANP. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR, we found intestinal dysbiosis and a significant increase of  MG1655 in ANP. Afterward, administration of  MG1655 by gavage to gut microbiota-depleted rats with ANP was performed. We observed that after ANP induction,  MG1655-monocolonized rats presented more severe injury in the pancreas and intestinal barrier function than gut microbiota-depleted rats. Furthermore, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/MyD88/p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAPK) and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) activation in intestinal epithelial cells were also increased more significantly in the MG1655-monocolonized ANP rats. , the rat ileal epithelial cell line IEC-18 displayed aggravated tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced inflammation and loss of  proteins in coculture with  MG1655, as well as TLR4, MyD88, and Bip upregulation. In conclusion, our study shows that commensal  MG1655 increases TLR4/MyD88/p38 MAPK and ERS signaling-induced intestinal epithelial injury and aggravates ANP in rats. Our study also describes the harmful potential of commensal  in ANP. This study describes the harmful potential of commensal  in ANP, which has not been demonstrated in previous studies.

To investigate impacts of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH; 7.-30 IU/kg, i.p.) on functional BBB properties in the hypoxic developing mouse brain (P7; 8% O for 6 h), expression of pro-apoptotic genes (BNIP3, DUSP1), inflammatory markers (IL-1ß, TNF-alpha, IL-6, MMP), and  proteins (ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, -), and S100b protein concentrations were analysed after a regeneration period of 24 h. Apoptotic cell death was quantified by CC3 immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining. In addition to increased apoptosis in the parietal cortex, hippocampus, and subventricular zone, hypoxia significantly enhanced the brain-to-plasma albumin ratio, the cerebral S100b protein levels, BNIP3 and DUSP1 mRNA concentrations as well as mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1ß, TNF-alpha). In response to C1-INH, albumin ratio and S100b concentrations were similar to those of controls. However, the mRNA expression of BNIP3 and DUSP1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as the degree of apoptosis were significantly decreased compared to non-treated controls. In addition, occludin mRNA levels were elevated in response to C1-INH (p < 0.01). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that C1-INH significantly decreased hypoxia-induced BBB leakage and apoptosis in the developing mouse brain, indicating its significance as a promising target for neuroprotective therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31023085>Sustained intraocular vascular endothelial growth factor neutralisation does not affect retinal and choroidal vasculature in Ins2 diabetic mice.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to understand the influence of sustained intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor neutralisation on the retinal and choroidal vasculature in diabetic eyes. Ins2 diabetic mice received five intravitreal injections of anti-mouse vascular endothelial growth factor antibody or goat immunoglobulin G (0.2 µg/µL/eye) over a 4-month period. Retinal and choroidal vascular changes were analysed by confocal microscopy of tissue flat-mounts. Retinal gene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor family members (vascular endothelial growth factors A, B, C and D), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (sVEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) and  (claudin 1, 2, ; occludin and zonula occludens-1) were analysed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Vascular endothelial growth factor A and claudin  were significantly increased in diabetic retinae. Gene expression was unaffected by anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment. The number of acellular vessels was increased in diabetic retinae and reduced following anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment. Retinal and choroidal vascular density and area were unaffected by sustained vascular endothelial growth factor neutralisation. Our results suggest that five consecutive intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections do not cause significant vascular changes in the retina and choroid in diabetic and non-diabetic mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608059>Exploiting the Zonulin Mouse Model to Establish the Role of Primary Impaired Gut Barrier Function on Microbiota Composition and Immune Profiles.</a></h1><p>The balanced interplay between epithelial barrier, immune system, and microbiota maintains gut homeostasis, while disruption of this interplay may lead to inflammation. Paracellular permeability is governed by intercellular  (TJs). Zonulin is, to date, the only known physiological regulator of intestinal TJs. We used a zonulin transgenic mouse (Ztm) model characterized by increased small intestinal permeability to elucidate the role of a primary impaired gut barrier on microbiome composition and/or immune profile. Ztm exhibit an altered gene expression profile of TJs in the gut compared to wild-type mice (WT): Claudin-15, Claudin-, Jam-3, and Myosin-1C are decreased in the male duodenum whereas Claudin-15, Claudin-7, and ZO-2 are reduced in the female colon. These results are compatible with loss of gut barrier function and are paralleled by an altered microbiota composition with reduced abundance of the genus , known to have positive effects on gut barrier integrity and strengthening, and an increased abundance of the  genus, associated to low-grade inflammatory conditions. Immune profile analysis shows a subtly skewed distribution of immune cell subsets toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype with more IL-17 producing adaptive and innate-like T cells in Ztm. Interestingly, microbiota "normalization" involving the transfer of WT microbiota into Ztm, did not rescue the altered immune profile. Our data suggest that a primary impaired gut barrier causing an uncontrolled trafficking of microbial products leads to a latent pro-inflammatory status, with a skewed microbiota composition and immune profile that, in the presence of an environmental trigger, as we have previously described (1), might promote the onset of overt inflammation and an increased risk of chronic disease.Copyright © 2019 Miranda-Ribera, Ennamorati, Serena, Cetinbas, Lan, Sadreyev, Jain, Fasano and Fiorentino.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572598>Effect of arabinoxylan on colonic bacterial metabolites and mucosal barrier in high-fat diet-induced rats.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effect of arabinoxylan on colonic mucosal barrier and metabolomic profiles in high-fat diet-induced rats.

Metabolomics assay found that the different abundances of 84 metabolites were observed, involving lipid, carbohydrate, and nitrogenous metabolism in colonic digesta. In colonic mucosa, AXD up-regulated gene level of -related proteins. Meanwhile, lower TNF-α and IL-1β levels were related to TLR4/NF-κB/MyD88 pathway in AXD group.

In this study, we investigated the potential anti-inflammatory and gut permeability protective effects of  (LJ) water extract (LJE) and three types of fermented  water extracts (LJE-F1, LJE-F2, and LJE-F3) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Caco-2, human intestinal epithelial cells. All four extracts significantly decreased the production of nitric oxide and interleukin-6 induced by LPS stimulus. In addition, LJE and the three types of LJE-Fs also inhibited LPS-induced loss of monolayer permeability, as assessed by changes in transepithelial electrical resistance. All four LJ extracts significantly prevented the inhibition of the protein levels of occludin, whereas LJE, LJE-F1, and LJE-F3 significantly attenuated the reduction in phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase compared with the LPS-treated group in Caco-2 cells. In conclusion, LJE and its fermented water extracts appear to have potential gut health-promoting effects by reducing inflammation and partially regulating the -related proteins in human intestinal epithelial cells.

But drug resistance will inevitably occur, thereby causing increased tumor invasion and metastasis. Claudin- (CLDN5) is a protein member of  (TJ) structures expressed in endothelial and epithelial cells and confirmed to be involved in the proliferation and leakage of endothelial cells (ECs) and malignant metastases. This study aimed to investigate how bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) neutralizing antibody applied in clinic, affects the  protein CLDN5 and subsequently influences tumor cell invasion and potential metastasis. Western-blot, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR), immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry revealed that low-dose bevacizumab up-regulated CLDN5, whereas high-dose bevacizumab down-regulated CLDN5. Cell migration, invasion and permeation assay demonstrated that high-dose bevacizumab enhanced the migration, invasion and permeation abilities of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The migration and permeation abilities of HUVECs were also enhanced by silencing the CLDN5 expression. CLDN5 was regulated by JNK, PI3K and transforming growth factor-β-1 (TGFβ1), and these findings were confirmed by the inhibitor or siRNA of JNK, PI3K and TGFβ1. Our data indicated that high-dose bevacizumab likely increased tumor invasion and potential metastatic abilities by down-regulating CLDN5, which was down regulated by TGFβ1. Low-dose bevacizumab increased CLDN5 expression by up-regulating PI3K and JNK expression.AJTR Copyright © 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401199>Labrasol® is an efficacious intestinal permeation enhancer across rat intestine: Ex vivo and in vivo rat studies.</a></h1><p>Labrasol® ALF (Labrasol®), is a non-ionic surfactant excipient primarily used as a solubilising agent. It was investigated here as an intestinal permeation enhancer in isolated rat colonic mucosae in Ussing chamber and in rat in situ intestinal instillations. Labrasol® comprises mono-, di- and triglycerides and mono- and di- fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-8 and free PEG-8, with caprylic (C)- and capric acid (C) as the main fatty acids. Source components of Labrasol® as well as Labrasol® modified with either C or C as the sole fatty acid components were also tested to determine which element of Labrasol® was responsible for its permeability-enhancing properties. Labrasol® (4, 8 mg/mL) enhanced the transport of the paracellular markers, [C] mannitol, FITC-dextran 4000, and FITC-insulin across colonic mucosae. The enhancement was non-damaging, transient, and molecular weight-dependent. The PEG ester fraction of Labrasol® also had enhancing properties. When insulin was administered with Labrasol® in instillations, it had a relative bioavailability of 7% in jejunum and 12% in colon. C- and C versions of Labrasol® and the PEG ester fraction also induced similar bioavailability values in jejunal instillations: 6,  and 7% respectively. Inhibition of lipases in instillations did not reduce the efficacy of Labrasol®, suggesting that its mechanism as a PE is not simply due to liberated medium chain fatty acids. Labrasol® acts as an efficacious intestinal permeation enhancer and has potential for use in oral formulations of macromolecules and BCS Class III molecules.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To act on target tissues, adiponectin must move from the circulation to the interstitial space, suggesting that vascular permeability plays an important role in regulating adiponectin action. To test this hypothesis, fluorescently labeled adiponectin was used to monitor its biodistribution in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes (STZD). Adiponectin was, indeed, found to have increased sequestration in the highly fenestrated liver and other tissues within 90 min in STZD mice. In addition, increased myocardial adiponectin was detected and confirmed using computed tomography (CT) coregistration. This provided support of adiponectin delivery to affected cardiac tissue as a cardioprotective mechanism. Higher adiponectin content in the STZD heart tissues was further examined by ex vivo fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) imaging, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis. In vitro mechanistic studies using an endothelial monolayer on inserts and three-dimensional microvascular networks on microfluidic chips further confirmed that adiponectin flux was increased by high glucose. However, in the in vitro model and mouse heart tissue, high glucose levels did not change adiponectin receptor levels. An examination of the  (TJ) complex revealed a decrease in the TJ protein claudin (CLDN)-7 in high glucose-treated endothelial cells, and the functional significance of this change was underscored by increased endothelium permeability upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of . Our data support the idea that glucose-induced effects on permeability of the vascular endothelium contribute to the actions of adiponectin by regulating its transendothelial movement from blood to the interstitial space. These observations are physiologically significant and critical when considering ways to harness the therapeutic potential of adiponectin for diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620663>Brief overview: Protective roles of astrocyte-derived pentraxin-3 in blood-brain barrier integrity.</a></h1><p>Stroke is one of the world's leading causes of mortality and morbidity. Greater understanding is required of the underlying relationships in ischemic brains in order to prevent stroke or to develop effective treatment. This review highlights new findings about the relationship of blood-brain barrier with astrocytes, pentraxin-3 (PTX3), and other factors expressed during or after ischemic stroke. These are discussed with respect to their ameliorative or deleterious effects. These effects are measured  in animal models as well as  in cell cultures. Evidence was found to suggest that astrocytes play a key role in stroke by expressing PTX3, which, in turn, enhances endothelial tightness, increases  proteins, and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor. The role of astrocytes and PTX3 is examined in relation to hypoxic stress and conditioning as well as mitochondrial transfer.

In the murine model of 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, we tested disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histological score and expression of  (TJ) proteins (ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1), OSM, TNF-α and TLR5. In addition, a cellular model was used to examine the role of  during secretion of OSM by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) isolated from wild-type (WT) and TLR5 knockout (TLR5 KO) mice. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of OSM on expressions of TJ proteins by Caco-2 cells.   in DSS-induced colitis decreased DAI score ( < .001), colon length shortening (6.46 ± 0.36 cm  .65 ± 0.47 cm,  = .022), histological score (2.667 ± 1.15  .33 ± 1.14,  = .018) and increased expression of TJ proteins ( < .05). In addition,  reduced expression of OSM ( < .05) and TNF-α ( < .05), while increasing expression of TLR5 ( < .05). Furthermore,  reduced secretion of OSM ( < .05) by LPS-induced BMDMs isolated from WT and TLR5 KO mice. Moreover, OSM downregulated expression of TJ proteins ( < .05) by Caco-2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner.  These results indicate that  attenuates inflammation in IBD by decreasing secretion of OSM and by promoting intestinal barrier function.

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on the gut-adipose tissue cross-talk in obese Zucker rats.Obese male Zucker rats (n = 36) were divided in three groups: MICT (12m.min-1 for 51min), HIIT (6 sets at 18 m.min-1 for 4min followed by 3min at 10m.min-1) and controls (CONT; no exercise). The animals ran on a treadmill  days/week for 10 weeks. Body composition, glycaemic control, lipid profile, inflammation, lipolysis signalling in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, intestinal permeability ( and plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein; LBP), and gut microbiota composition were assessed in the three groups.After 10 weeks of exercise, total and epididymal fat mass decreased only in the HIIT group. The α/β adrenergic receptor RNA ratio in subcutaneous adipose tissue increased only in the HIIT group. The expression level of phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase was not modified by training. Both HIIT and MICT decreased inflammation (plasma myeloperoxidase and keratinocyte-derived chemokine secretion in adipose tissue) and improved glucose metabolism. Zonula occludens-1 and occludin were upregulated in the HIIT group. Plasma LBP was similarly reduced in both training groups. HIIT and MICT did not affect gut microbiota composition.In obese Zucker rats, HIIT and MICT improved inflammation and glucose metabolism. In contrast, only HIIT decreased total and visceral fat mass.

We used proximity biotinylation followed by mass spectrometry and direct binding assays to identify proteins that associated with wild-type and various mutant forms of Merlin in immortalized Schwann cells. We defined a set of 52 proteins in close proximity to wild-type Merlin. Most of the Merlin-proximal proteins were components of cell junctional signaling complexes, suggesting that additional potential interaction partners may exist in adherens , , and focal adhesions. With mutant forms of Merlin that cannot bind to phosphatidylinositol 4,-bisphosphate (PIP) or that constitutively adopt a closed conformation, we confirmed a critical role for PIP binding in Merlin function and identified a large cohort of proteins that specifically interacted with Merlin in the closed conformation. Among these proteins, we identified a previously unreported Merlin-binding protein, apoptosis-stimulated p53 protein 2 (ASPP2, also called Tp53bp2), that bound to closed-conformation Merlin predominately through the FERM domain. Our results demonstrate that Merlin is a component of cell junctional mechanosensing complexes and defines a specific set of proteins through which it acts.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

We have previously shown that diabetes causes an imbalance of nerve growth factor (NGF) isoforms resulting in accumulation of its precursor proNGF and upregulation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75), with consequent increases in the activation of Ras homologue gene family, member A (RhoA). We also showed that genetic deletion of p75 in diabetes preserved the BRB and prevented inflammatory mediators in retinas. This study aims to examine the therapeutic potential of LM11A-31, a small-molecule p75 modulator and proNGF antagonist, in preventing diabetes-induced BRB breakdown. The study also examined the role of p75/RhoA downstream signalling in mediating cell permeability.Male C57BL/6 J mice were rendered diabetic using streptozotocin injection. After 2 weeks of diabetes, mice received oral gavage of LM11A-31 (50 mg kg day) or saline (NaCl 154 mmol/l) for an additional 4 weeks. BRB breakdown was assessed by extravasation of BSA-AlexaFluor-488. Direct effects of proNGF were examined in human retinal endothelial (HRE) cells in the presence or absence of LM11A-31 or the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632.Diabetes triggered BRB breakdown and caused significant increases in circulatory and retinal TNF-α and IL-1β levels. These effects coincided with significant decreases in retinal NGF and increases in vascular endothelial growth factor and proNGF expression, as well as activation of RhoA. Interventional modulation of p75 activity through treatment of mouse models of diabetes with LM11A-31 significantly mitigated proNGF accumulation and preserved BRB integrity. In HRE cells, treatment with mutant proNGF (10 ng/ml) triggered increased cell permeability with marked reduction of expression of  proteins, zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-, compared with control, independent of inflammatory mediators or cell death. Modulating p75 significantly inhibited proNGF-mediated RhoA activation, occludin phosphorylation (at serine 490) and cell permeability. ProNGF induced redistribution of ZO-1 in the cell wall and formation of F-actin stress fibres; these effects were mitigated by LM11A-31.Targeting p75 signalling using LM11A-31, an orally bioavailable receptor modulator, may offer an effective, safe and non-invasive therapeutic strategy for treating macular oedema, a major cause of blindness in diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642122>Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide may affect the endothelial barrier and IL-10 expression of apolipoprotein B100-pulsed dendritic cells.</a></h1><p>Atherogenesis is associated with chronic gut infections; however, the mechanisms are not clear. The aim of the study was to determine whether lipopolysaccharide of E. coli (E. coli LPS) may affect endothelial barrier and modify IL-10 expression in dendritic cells (DCs). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and monocyte-derived DCs were treated with E. coli LPS, apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100) and 7-ketocholesterol (7-kCH) - harmful oxidized form of cholesterol. The effect of E. coli LPS, 7-kCH and ApoB100 on the barrier functions of HUVECs in real-time cell electric impedance sensing system (RTCA-DP) was assessed. Furthermore, the effect of 7-kCH and ApoB100 on barrier functions of HUVECs co-cultured with DCs previously treated with LPS was analyzed. Both E. coli LPS and 7-kCH decreased barrier functions of HUVECs and reduced  proteins mRNA expression, whereas ApoB100 increased endothelial barrier. In DCs, ApoB100 and E. coli LPS decreased IL-10 mRNA expression. In HUVECs co-cultured with DCs treated with LPS and subsequently pulsed with ApoB100 or 7-kCH IL-10 mRNA expression was lower. E. coli LPS-exposed DCs diminished the protective effect of ApoB100 on endothelial integrity and led to the decrease of occludin mRNA expression. LPS potentially derived from gut microflora may destabilize endothelial barrier together with oxidized cholesterol and intensify the immunogenicity of ApoB100.© 2019 APMIS.

HCEndoCs, either primary (pHCEndoC) or cell line (HCEndoCL), were either seeded in chamber slides, directly on the Transwell membranes, or on the 3D HCF constructs and cultivated for  days or 2 weeks. The HCEndoCs that were seeded directly on the Transwell membranes were exposed indirectly to HCF by culturing the HCF on the plate beneath the membrane. Cultures were examined for morphology and ultrastructure using light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, indirect-immunofluorescence microscopy (IF) was used to examine  formation (ZO-1), maturation (ALDH1A1), basement membrane formation (Laminin), cell proliferation (Ki67), cell death (caspase-3), and fibrotic response (CTGF). As expected, both pHCEndoCs and HCEndoCLs formed monolayers on the constructs; however, the morphology of the HCEndoCLs appeared to be similar to that seen in vivo, uniform and closely packed, whereas the pHCEndoCs remained elongated. The IF data showed that laminin localization was present in the HCEndoCs' cytoplasm as cell-cell contact increased, and when they were grown in the 3D co-culture, the beginnings of what appears to be a continuous DM-like structure was observed. In addition, in co-cultures, ALDH1A1-positive HCEndoCs were present, ZO-1 expression localized within the , minimal numbers of HCEndoCs were Ki67-or Caspase-3-positive, and CTGF was positive in both the HCEndoCs cytoplasm and the matrix of the co-culture. Also, laminin localization was stimulated in HCEndoCs upon indirect stimuli secreted by HCF. The present data suggests our 3D co-culture model is useful for studying corneal endothelium maturation in vitro since the co-culture promotes new DM-like formation, HCEndoCs develop in vivo-like characteristics, and the fibrotic response is activated. Our current findings are applicable to understanding the implications of corneal endothelial injection therapy, such as if the abnormal DM has to be removed from the patient, the newly injected endothelial cells will seed onto the wound area and deposit a new DM-like membrane. However, caution should be observed and as much of the normal DM should be left intact since removal of the DM can cause a posterior stromal fibrotic response.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We developed a triple-cell culture in vitro model utilizing a membrane system to produce a better representation of a functional and morphological human retina.Retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMVEC/ACBRI181, cell systems), retinal pigment epithelium cells (RPE/ARPE-19, ATCC) and Müller glial cells (Moorfield Institute of Ophthalmology-Müller 1, UCL) were grown in a triple culture. Our optimized triple-culture media contained a mix of specific endothelial medium and high glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium, where all three layers were viable for up to  days. Co-culture effect on morphological changes (cell staining) and gene expression of functional genes (pigment epithelium derived factor [PEDF] and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) were measured from RNA via real-time polymerase chain reaction. Expression of  protein 1 (TJP1) was measured in RNA isolated from ARPE-19s, to assess barrier stability.The triple-culture promotes certain cell functionality through up-regulation of TJP1, increasing PEDF and decreasing VEGF expression highlighting its importance for the assessment of disease mechanisms distinct from a solo culture which would not allow the true effect of the native microenvironment to be elucidated.This model's novelty and reliability allows for the assessment of singular cellular function within the retinal microenvironment and overall assessment of retinal health, while eliminating the requirement of animal-based models.© 2019 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31414732>Effect of PI3K/PKB signal pathway inhibitor wortmannin pretreatment on intestinal barrier function in severe acute pancreatitic rats.</a></h1><p>It is well-known that severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) due to infection is mainly caused by intestinal bacterial translocation. The intestinal barrier is tasked with preventing intestinal pathogenic bacteria and toxins from reaching the parenteral tissues through the intestinal wall. Therefore, maintaining intestinal barrier function may be the key to preventing damage from acute pancreatitis (AP). The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway (PI3K/PKB) plays a role in AP. However, the exact effect of PI3K/PKB on injury associated with SAP has not yet been found.The present study was aimed at investigating the impact of wortmannin (WT), a PI3K/PKB inhibitor, on intestinal barrier function in SAP rats.The rats were divided into 3 groups: 1) the Sham Surgery group (SS), whose duodenum and pancreas were flipped 3 times (n = 18); 2) the pancreatitis group (SAP), who were injected through retrograde pancreatic duct injection with % sodium taurocholate (n = 18); and 3) the WSAP intervention group (SAP+WT). Serum alpha-amylase levels, plasma endogenous endotoxin, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, intestinal mucosa electron microscopy, intestinal permeability, and expression of p-PKB (phosphorylated protein kinase B) were measured.In our findings under an electron microscope, the SAP group presented cell edema and mitochondrial vacuolated degeneration, sparsely arranged microvilli,  damage, and widening, while the WSAP group exhibited less change and lower pancreas scores (7.4 ±1.14, 10.2 ±1.48 and 12.0 ±1.58 for 3 h, 6 h and 12 h, respectively) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the plasma endogenous endotoxin levels and Evans blue content of the WSAP group was significantly lower at all timepoints than in the SAP group (p < 0.05). Western blotting showed that p-PKB expression was lower in the WSAP group than in the SAP group (p < 0.05). Our study suggests that WT relieves intestinal permeability changes in SAP rats and may be dose-dependent.The PI3K/PKB signal pathway may involve SAP-related intestinal injuries and WT may relieve SAP intestinal injuries through the PI3K/PKB pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31490234>CDX2 Loss With Microsatellite Stable Phenotype Predicts Poor Clinical Outcome in Stage II Colorectal Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Current risk factors in stage II colorectal carcinoma are insufficient to guide treatment decisions. Loss of CDX2 has been shown to associate with poor clinical outcome and predict benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II and III colorectal carcinoma. The prognostic relevance of CDX2 in stage II disease has not been sufficiently validated, especially in relation to clinical risk factors, such as microsatellite instability (MSI) status, BRAF mutation status, and tumor budding. In this study, we evaluated the protein expression of CDX2 in tumor center and front areas in a tissue microarrays material of stage II colorectal carcinoma patients (n=232). CDX2 expression showed a partial or total loss in respective areas in 8.6% and 10.9% of patient cases. Patients with loss of CDX2 had shorter disease-specific survival when scored independently either in tumor center or tumor front areas (log rank P=0.012; P=0.012). Loss of CDX2 predicted survival independently of other stage II risk factors, such as MSI status and BRAF mutation status, pT class, and tumor budding (hazard ratio=.96, 95% confidence interval=1.55-22.95; hazard ratio=3.70, 95% confidence interval=1.30-10.56). Importantly, CDX2 loss predicted inferior survival only in patients with microsatellite stable, but not with MSI-high phenotype. Interestingly, CDX2 loss associated with low E-cadherin expression,  disruption, and high expression of ezrin protein. The work demonstrates that loss of CDX2 is an independent risk factor of poor disease-specific survival in stage II colorectal carcinoma. Furthermore, the study suggests that CDX2 loss is linked with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition independently of tumor budding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31389714>Effects of a feed additive blend on broilers challenged with heat stress.</a></h1><p>We evaluated a blend of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA), organic acids, and a polyphenol antioxidant on gut integrity. Eighty Ross Broilers were exposed to 20-22°C (control - normothermic) or to 35-39.°C (heat stress) for eight hours a day for a period of 1 or  days. Birds were fed a standard diet, or a diet supplemented with the test blend. Thereafter, birds were euthanized, and intestinal sections were excised for morphological, morphometric and gene expression analyses. Blood samples were collected for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) determination. Heart and liver tissues were used to quantify the expression of heat shock proteins 60 and 70 (HSP60 and HSP70, respectively) and inhibitor of kappa light chain gene enhancer in B cells alpha (IKBA). The jejunum was the most sensitive intestinal section, where heat stress modulated the expression of HSP70, of the inflammatory markers IKBA, interleukin 8 (IL-8), interferon gamma (IFNγ), and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Moreover, expression of  (CLDN1, ZO1 and ZO2) and nutrient transporters (PEPT1 and EAAT3) was modulated especially in the jejunum. In conclusion, the feed additive blend protected intestines during heat stress from the decrease in villus height and crypt depth, and from the increase in villus width. Especially in the jejunum, heat stress played an important role by modulating oxidative stress and inflammation, impairing gut integrity and nutrient transport, and such deleterious effects were alleviated by the feed additive blend.  Jejunum is the most sensitive intestinal segment during heat stress. Heat stress affects the expression of  and nutrient transporters. Feed management helps to alleviate the disturbances caused by heat stress. A blend of MCFA, organic acids and a polyphenol protects broilers under heat stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31543522>Probing Endothelial Cell Mechanics Through Connexin 43 Disruption.</a></h1><p>The endothelium has been established to generate intercellular stresses and suggested to transmit these intercellular stresses through cell-cell , such as VE-Cadherin and ZO-1, for example. Although the previously mentioned molecules reflect the appreciable contributions both adherens  and  are believed to have in endothelial cell intercellular stresses, in doing so they also reveal the obscure relationship that exists between gap  and intercellular stresses. Therefore, to bring clarity to this relationship we disrupted expression of the endothelial gap  connexin 43 (Cx43) by exposing confluent human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to a low (0.2 μg/mL) and high (2 μg/mL) concentration of 2,-dihydroxychalcone (chalcone), a known Cx43 inhibitor. To evaluate the impact Cx43 disruption had on endothelial cell mechanics we utilized traction force microscopy and monolayer stress microscopy to measure cell-substrate tractions and cell-cell intercellular stresses, respectively. HUVEC monolayers exposed to a low concentration of chalcone produced average normal intercellular stresses that were on average 17% higher relative to control, while exposure to a high concentration of chalcone yielded average normal intercellular stresses that were on average 55% lower when compared to control HUVEC monolayers. HUVEC maximum shear intercellular stresses were observed to decrease by 16% (low chalcone concentration) and 66% (high chalcone concentration), while tractions exhibited an almost 2-fold decrease under high chalcone concentration. In addition, monolayer cell velocities were observed to decrease by 19% and 35% at low chalcone and high chalcone concentrations, respectively. Strain energies were also observed to decrease by 32% and 85% at low and high concentration of chalcone treatment, respectively, when compared to control. The findings we present here reveal for the first time the contribution Cx43 has to endothelial biomechanics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31419374>Model of persistent foot-and-mouth disease virus infection in multilayered cells derived from bovine dorsal soft palate.</a></h1><p>Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) causes a highly contagious vesicular disease in livestock, with serious consequences for international trade. The virus persists in the nasopharynx of cattle and this slows down the process to obtain an FMDV-free status after an outbreak. To study biological mechanisms, or to identify molecules that can be targeted to diagnose or interfere with persistence, we developed a model of persistent FMDV infection in bovine dorsal soft palate (DSP). Primary DSP cells were isolated after commercial slaughter and were cultured in multilayers at the air-liquid interface. After  weeks of culture without further passage, the cells were infected with FMDV strain O/FRA/1/2001. Approximately, 20% of cells still had a polygonal morphology and displayed  as in stratified squamous epithelia. Subsets of cells expressed cytokeratin and most or all cells expressed vimentin. In contrast to monolayers in medium, multilayers in air demonstrated only a limited cytopathic effect. Integrin α β expression was observed in mono- but not in multilayers. FMDV antigen, FMDV RNA and live virus were detected from day 1 to 28, with peaks at day 1 and 2. The proportion of infected cells was highest at 24 hr (3% and 36% of cells at an MOI of 0.01 and 1, respectively). At day 28 after infection, at a time when animals that still harbour FMDV are considered carriers, FMDV antigen was detected in 0.2%-2.1% of cells, in all layers, and live virus was isolated from supernatants of 6/8 cultures. On the consensus level, the viral genome did not change within the first 24 hr after infection. Only a few minor single nucleotide variants were detected, giving no indication of the presence of a viral quasispecies. The air-liquid interface model of DSP brings new possibilities to investigate FMDV persistence in a controlled manner.© 2019 The Authors.

This study included 2 experiments. In experiment (Exp.) 1, sixteen 35-day-old meat ducks were used to evaluate the AME of RPS by orogastric administration. Results showed the AME value of RPS on ducks is 2.76 kcal/g. In Exp. 2, a total of 600 one-day-old ducklings were randomly assigned to  isonitrogenous and isoenergetic dietary treatments that included 0 (control), 6, 12, 18, and 24% RPS, respectively. Samples were collected at both of 14 and 35 D. Neither growth performance nor ileal parameters (length, weight, and pH) at both of 14 and 35 D was affected by dietary RPS. However, the mucosal thickness (14 D), villus height (except for 18% RPS at 14 D), and the villus height: crypt depth ratio (14 and 35 D) of the ileum were increased in the 12 and 18% RPS diets when compared to 0% RPS diet. Meanwhile, proinflammatory factors such as plasma interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 (14 D) reduced in 12% RPS diet and tumor necrosis factor α decreased in 12% (except for 14 D) and 18% RPS groups. When compared with the control group, diets with 18% RPS significantly increased mucin 2 gene expression at 14 D, and 12% RPS elevated the mRNA expression of  proteins including Zonula occludens-1 and Claudin 1 (except for 14 D) in the ileal mucosa of birds. Furthermore, ducks fed 12% RPS diet had higher concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate in cecal digesta than other groups. These findings indicated that diets with 12 and/or 18% RPS increased the cecal SCFA concentration, which subsequently enhanced the barrier function and improved intestinal health in the ileum for 14 and 35-day-old meat ducks.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022698>Inflammatory Bowel Disease Susceptibility Gene  Regulates Intestinal Epithelial Permeability.</a></h1><p>Intestinal epithelial cells form a physical barrier that is tightly regulated to control intestinal permeability.

We present a new in vitro prediction method for acute inhalation toxicity using the Calu-3 epithelial cytotoxicity assay applicable for water-soluble inhalable chemicals.To confirm the characteristics of the optimal Calu-3 epithelium,  formation, morphology, and mucus secretion were verified using scanning electron microscopy, transepithelial electrical resistance analysis, and immunofluorescence after growth in an air-liquid interface (ALI). Sixty chemicals, including 38 positive and 22 negative for acute inhalation toxicity, were selected from the European Chemical Agency chemical database. The cell viability of the exposed cells was assessed using an MTT assay to predict the acute inhalation toxicity by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and accuracy.When cultivated in an ALI, the epithelium was thicker and secreted more mucin than that under submerged cultivation, characteristic of the in vivo respiratory epithelium. The areas under the ROC curve were 0.75 and 0.78 when exposed to chemicals at concentrations of 2. and %, respectively. The highest accuracy of the methods was 68 and 78% at cut-off values of 85 and 40% cell viability, respectively.The in vitro model was moderately accurate with good prediction. It is replicable because of its advantages, i.e., the use of cultured cells and the simplicity of the method. Overall, the Calu-3 epithelial cytotoxicity assay may be a useful and simple approach to identify substances that cause acute inhalation toxicity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

These changes are one important ecological consequence, contributing to the risk of extinction in small and inbred fish populations under natural conditions, due to male-biased sex ratio. Here we investigated the effect of elevated water temperature during embryogenesis on sex ratio and sex-biased gene expression profiles between two different tissues, namely gonad and caudal fin of adult zebrafish males and females, to gain new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying sex determination (SD) and colour patterning related to sexual attractiveness.Our study demonstrated sex ratio imbalances with 25.% more males under high-temperature condition, resulting from gonadal masculinization. The result of transcriptome analysis showed a significantly upregulated expression of male SD genes (e.g. dmrt1, amh, cyp11c1 and sept8b) and downregulation of female SD genes (e.g. zp2.1, vtg1, cyp19a1a and bmp15) in male gonads compared to female gonads. Contrary to expectations, we found highly differential expression of colour pattern (CP) genes in the gonads, suggesting the 'neofunctionalisation' of those genes in the zebrafish reproduction system. However, in the caudal fin, no differential expression of CP genes was identified, suggesting the observed differences in colouration between males and females in adult fish may be due to post-transcriptional regulation of key enzymes involved in pigment synthesis and distribution.Our study demonstrates male-biased sex ratio under high temperature condition and support a polygenic SD (PSD) system in laboratory zebrafish. We identify a subset of pathways (, gap  and apoptosis), enriched for SD and CP genes, which appear to be co-regulated in the same pathway, providing evidence for involvement of those genes in the regulation of phenotypic sexual dimorphism in zebrafish.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30958728>Targeted TNF-α Overexpression Drives Salivary Gland Inflammation.</a></h1><p>Chronic inflammation of the salivary glands from pathologic conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome can result in glandular destruction and hyposalivation. To understand which molecular factors may play a role in clinical cases of salivary gland hypofunction, we developed an aquaporin  (AQP5) Cre mouse line to produce genetic recombination predominantly within the acinar cells of the glands. We then bred these mice with the TNF-αglo transgenic line to develop a mouse model with salivary gland-specific overexpression of TNF-α; which replicates conditions seen in sialadenitis, an inflammation of the salivary glands resulting from infection or autoimmune disorders such as Sjögren's syndrome. The resulting AQP5-Cre/TNF-αglo mice display severe inflammation in the salivary glands with acinar cell atrophy, fibrosis, and dilation of the ducts. AQP5 expression was reduced in the salivary glands, while  integrity appeared to be disrupted. The immune dysregulation in the salivary gland of these mice led to hyposalivation and masticatory dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31249876>A microfluidic model of human brain (μHuB) for assessment of blood brain barrier.</a></h1><p>Microfluidic cellular models, commonly referred to as "organs-on-chips," continue to advance the field of bioengineering via the development of accurate and higher throughput models, captivating the essence of living human organs. This class of models can mimic key in vivo features, including shear stresses and cellular architectures, in ways that cannot be realized by traditional two-dimensional in vitro models. Despite such progress, current organ-on-a-chip models are often overly complex, require highly specialized setups and equipment, and lack the ability to easily ascertain temporal and spatial differences in the transport kinetics of compounds translocating across cellular barriers. To address this challenge, we report the development of a three-dimensional human blood brain barrier (BBB) microfluidic model (μHuB) using human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) and primary human astrocytes within a commercially available microfluidic platform. Within μHuB, hCMEC/D3 monolayers withstood physiologically relevant shear stresses (2.73 dyn/cm) over a period of 24 hr and formed a complete inner lumen, resembling in vivo blood capillaries. Monolayers within μHuB expressed phenotypical  markers (Claudin- and ZO-1), which increased expression after the presence of hemodynamic-like shear stress. Negligible cell injury was observed when the monolayers were cultured statically, conditioned to shear stress, and subjected to nonfluorescent dextran (70 kDa) transport studies. μHuB experienced size-selective permeability of 10 and 70 kDa dextrans similar to other BBB models. However, with the ability to probe temporal and spatial evolution of solute distribution, μHuBs possess the ability to capture the true variability in permeability across a cellular monolayer over time and allow for evaluation of the full breadth of permeabilities that would otherwise be lost using traditional end-point sampling techniques. Overall, the μHuB platform provides a simplified, easy-to-use model to further investigate the complexities of the human BBB in real-time and can be readily adapted to incorporate additional cell types of the neurovascular unit and beyond.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995438>Geniposide protects against hypoxia/reperfusion-induced blood-brain barrier impairment by increasing  protein expression and decreasing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in an in vitro system.</a></h1><p>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is involved in the pathogeneses of ischemic stroke (IS). Geniposide (GEN), an iridoid glycoside isolated from Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, has been used for the treatment of IS. However, the effects of GEN on the BBB are poorly understood. In vitro disease models of the BBB could be very helpful for the elucidation of underlying mechanisms and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we established an in vitro BBB model composed of primary cultures of brain microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes. We then used this in vitro model to investigate the effect of GEN on the function of the BBB. Oxygen glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) significantly increased permeability and cell apoptosis in this in vitro BBB model. Notably, GEN pretreatment effectively improved the BBB function by decreasing the permeability of the BBB, promoting expression of  proteins (zonula occludens-1, claudin-, and occludin) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, increasing transendothelial electrical resistance, mitigating oxidative stress damage and the release of inflammatory cytokines, downregulating the expression levels of matrix metallopeptidases-9 (MMP-9) and MMP-2, and increasing the release of brain derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell derived neurotrophic factor. Therefore, GEN can ameliorate the BBB dysfunction induced by OGD/R conditions through multiple protective mechanisms. The findings suggest that GEN may be an appropriate drug for restoring the barrier function of the BBB.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we observed the dynamic effect and potential mechanism of ioversol on the BBB in rats. Eighty-one healthy rats were randomly divided into a normal control group (n = 9), ioversol group (n = 36), and 0.9% NaCl group (n = 36); the latter two groups were separately subdivided into four groups based on time points after treatment (0., 3, 6, and 24 h) (n = 9/group). Permeability of the BBB was measured by an Evans Blue (EB) assay. Levels of the  (TJ) proteins ZO-1 and occludin were determined by western blot and immunofluorescence staining. EB content increased at 3 h after the administration of ioversol via the carotid artery and reached a peak at 6 h (P < 0.05), whereas it decreased to its normal level at 24 h. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining indicated that the expression of ZO-1 in brain tissues gradually decreased to its lowest level at 3 h, and then increased gradually, but was still lower than that of the normal control group at 24 h (P < 0.05). Occludin was similar, but its lowest expression appeared at 0. h. This study demonstrated that the permeability of BBB in rats increased first and then decreased after ioversol was injected into the carotid artery. The mechanism may be related to altered protein expression of TJs, which are important structures in BBB. Early intervention against TJ proteins may be an effective measure to prevent and treat CIE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176009>Citric acid mitigates soybean meal induced inflammatory response and  disruption by altering TLR signal transduction in the intestine of turbot, Scophthalmus maximus L.</a></h1><p>A 12-week feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effect of citric acid on the involvement of TLRs in the soybean meal induced inflammatory response and  disruption in the distal intestine of juvenile turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.). Four isonitrogenous and isolipidic practical diets were formulated: fish meal-based diet (FM); 40% fish meal protein in FM replaced with soybean meal protein (SBM); SBM + 1.% citric acid and SBM + 3% citric acid. Compared to the FM, diet SBM significantly increased the gene expression of TLRs (TLR2, TLR3, TLR5b, TLR9, TLR21, TLR22) and MyD88, as well as TLR related molecules (NF-κB, IRF-3, p38 and JNK), which were remarkably reduced by dietary citric acid. Similarly, citric acid supplementation in SBM markedly depressed gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ) and pore-forming  protein Claudin-7, and enhanced gene expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-β1 and TJ proteins related to the decrease in paracellular permeability (Claudin-3, Claudin-4, Occludin, Tricellulin and ZO-1). Compared to the SBM, the concentration of IgM and C4 in serum was significantly reduced by dietary citric acid. In brief, dietary citric acid could synchronously inhibit TLRs-dependent inflammatory response regulated by NF-κB and IRF3, as well as cause TLRs-dependent  disruption modulated by p38 and JNK. Therefore, citric acid could function on mitigating soybean meal induced enteropathy in the distal intestine of juvenile turbot.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The pathogenesis of EV71-induced pulmonary edema remains largely unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore the roles of the capsid protein VP1 in the occurrence of EV71-induced pulmonary edema. The intranasal inoculation of recombinant VP1 protein caused lung inflammation with an elevation of inflammatory cytokines and neutrophils infiltration. Moreover, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were observed in the lung parenchyma of the mice treated with VP1. VP1 directly induced the formation of NETs, which depended on PAD4. VP1 also damaged the lung barrier via the reduction of the  protein occludin. Moreover, the EV71 attachment receptor vimentin was increased upon VP1 administration. In contrast, NETs decreased vimentin levels, suggesting a novel role for NETs in viral immune defense. These results evidenced a direct role of VP1 in EV71-induced pulmonary edema and demonstrated that NETs may be both harmful and beneficial in EV71 infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302522>Electroconvulsive shock restores the decreased coverage of brain blood vessels by astrocytic endfeet and ameliorates depressive-like behavior.</a></h1><p>Although growing evidence indicates that ECT affects astrocytes, the exact mechanisms of the therapeutic effect of ECT are still unknown.

It has been shown that the coverage of blood vessels by AQP4-immunostained endfeet is decreased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of patients with major depression. This study was made to determine whether ECT restores the astrocytic coverage of blood vessels with amelioration of depressive symptoms.After electroconvulsive shock (ECS) administration to rats, the forced swimming test (FST) and Y-maze test were performed. Subsequently, immunofluorescence analysis was conducted to measure the coverage of blood vessels by astrocytic endfeet in the PFC and hippocampus by using the endothelial cell marker lectin and anti-AQP4 antibody. We also performed Western blot to examine the effects of ECS on the hippocampal expression of AQP4 and the  molecule claudin-.Gunn rats showed learned helplessness and impaired spatial working memory, compared to normal control Wistar rats. ECS significantly improved the depressive-like behavior. Gunn rats showed a decrease in astrocytic coverage of blood vessels, that was significantly increased by ECS. ECS significantly increased expression of AQP4 and claudin- in Gunn rats.ECS increased the reduced coverage of blood vessels by astrocytic endfeet in the mPFC and hippocampus with amelioration of depressive-like behavior. Therefore, therapeutic mechanism of ECT may involve restoration of the impaired gliovascular units by increasing the astrocytic-endfoot coverage of blood vessels.Copyright © 2019.

The present study investigated relationships among  protein gene expression, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection, and intestinal mucosal morphology in piglets. We compared the expression of six  proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2, Occludin, Claudin-1, Claudin-4, and Claudin-) between seven-day-old piglets infected with PEDV and normal piglets, as well as in PEDV-infected porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). We also evaluated differences in mucosal morphology between PEDV-infected and normal piglets. The expression of six  protein genes was lower in PEDV-infected piglets than in the normal animals. The expression of ZO-1, ZO-2, Occludin, and Claudin-4 in the intestine tissue was significantly lower (p⟨0.05) in PEDV-infected than in normal piglets. The expression of Claudin- in the jejunum was significantly lower in PEDV-infected piglets than in the normal animals (p⟨0.01). The expression of Claudin-1 and Claudin- genes in the ileum was significantly higher in PEDV-infected piglets than in normal piglets (p⟨0.01). Morphologically, the intestinal mucosa in PEDV-infected piglets exhibited clear pathological changes, including breakage and shedding of intestinal villi. In PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells, the mRNA expression of the six  proteins showed a downward trend; in particular, the expression of the Occludin and Claudin-4 genes was significantly lower (p⟨0.01). These data suggest that the expression of these six  proteins, especially Occludin and Claudin-4, plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier and resistance to PEDV infection in piglets.Copyright© by the Polish Academy of Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31328334>Transport stress induces pig jejunum tissue oxidative damage and results in autophagy/mitophagy activation.</a></h1><p>Pig transportation is associated with intestinal oxidative stress and results in destruction of intestinal integrity. Autophagy has been contributed to maintain cell homeostasis under stresses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of transport stress on morphology, intestinal mucosal barrier and autophagy/mitophagy levels in pig jejunum. A total of 16 finishing pigs were randomly divided into two groups. The control group was directly transported to the slaughterhouse and rested for 24 hr. The experimental groups were transported for  hr and slaughtered immediately. The results showed that transportation induced obvious stress responses with morphological and histological damage in jejunum accompanying with an elevated level of malondialdehyde (MDA; p < .05), endotoxin (LPS; p < .05), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH; p < .05) and a decreased level of serum superoxide dismutase (SOD; p < .05). Also, hemeoxy genase 1 (HO-1; p < .01) as well as  protein (claudin-1 [p < .001], occludin [p < .05] and zonula occludens 1 [ZO-1; p < 0.05]) levels were attenuated in jejunum tissue, and NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1; p < .01) mRNA expression was up-regulated. Further research indicated that transport stress could induce autophagy through increasing microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3; p < .05) and autophagy-related gene  (ATG5; p < .01) levels and suppressing p62 expression. Additionally, transport stress increased the protein levels of PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1; p < .05) and Parkin (p < .05) which was associated with mitophagy. In conclusions, transport stress could induce the destruction of intestinal integrity and involve in the intestinal mucosal barrier oxidative damage, and also contribute to activation of autophagy/mitophagy.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191319>Neuroprotective Effects and Hepatorenal Toxicity of Angong Niuhuang Wan Against Ischemia-Reperfusion Brain Injury in Rats.</a></h1><p>Angong Niuhuang Wan (AGNHW) is a classic prescription in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used for stroke treatment, but its efficacies remain to be confirmed. With its arsenic- and mercury-containing materials, the application of AGNHW raises great safety concerns. Herein, we aim to explore the neuropharmacological effects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury and evaluate the toxicological effects of AGNHW for better use. Male SD rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and following 22 h of reperfusion. AGNHW (257 mg/kg, 1× AGNHW) were orally administered for pharmacological effects and 257, 514, and 1,028 mg/kg (equivalent to 1×, 2×, 4× AGNHW) were used for the toxicological study. The results revealed that AGNHW treatment reduced the infarct size and protected the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in the MCAO rat ischemic stroke model. AGNHW treatment up-regulated bcl-2 expression and down-regulated the expressions of Bax, p47, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), and inhibited the expressions and activities of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, and reserved  protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin- in the ischemic brains. These results indicated that the neuroprotective mechanisms of AGNHW could be associated with its antioxidant properties by inhibiting oxidative/nitrative stress-mediated MMP activation and protecting  proteins in the ischemic brains. Administration of 1× AGNHW for 7 days would not induce the accumulation of mercury in blood, liver, and kidney at day 14. Administration of 2× AGNHW and 4× AGNHW for 7 days increased the level of mercury in the kidney. For arsenic level, administration of 1× AGNHW for 7 days would increase the level of arsenic in the liver and blood without increase of arsenic in the kidney at day 14. Administration of 2× AGNHW and 4× AGNHW for 7 days would further increase the level of arsenic in the liver and blood. There is no influence on body weight, organ index, histological structures, and renal and liver functions. These results suggest that short-term treatment of AGNHW within 1 week should be safe and has neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271645>Erg mediates downregulation of claudin- in the brain endothelium of a murine experimental model of cerebral malaria.</a></h1><p>Cerebral malaria (CM) is a severe complication with brain vascular hyperpermeability. Claudin- is the major component of . To investigate the expression of claudin- in CM, we established a murine experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) model and an in vitro model by treating murine brain endothelial cells (bEnd3) with plasma from ECM mice. Expression of claudin- and the ETS transcription factor Erg was reduced in the brain endothelium of ECM mice. In bEnd3 cells exposed to ECM plasma, decreased expression of claudin- and Erg, and increased permeability were observed. Silencing of Erg significantly reduced Cldn5 expression. ChIP assays indicated that Erg binds to the -813 ETS motif of the murine Cldn5 gene promoter, and the binding is decreased by treatment with ECM plasma.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302133>Blood-retinal barrier protection against high glucose damage: The role of P2X7 receptor.</a></h1><p>Blood retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown is a hallmark of diabetic retinopathy, whose occurrence in early or later phases of the disease has not yet been completely clarified. Recent evidence suggests that hyperglycemia induces activation of the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) leading to pericyte cell death. We herein investigated the role of P2X7R on retinal endothelial cells viability and expression of - and adherens- following high glucose (HG) exposure. We found that HG elicited P2X7R activation and expression and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs). Furthermore, HG exposure caused a decrease in HRECs viability and a damage of the BRB. JNJ47965567, a P2X7R antagonist, protected HRECs from HG-induced damage (LDH release) and preserved the BRB, as shown by transendothelial electrical resistance and cell  morphology (ZO-1, claudin- and VE-cadherin). Moreover, JNJ47965567 treatment significantly decreased IL-1β expression and release, elicited by HG. These data indicate that P2X7R plays an important role to regulate BRB integrity, in particular the block of this receptor was useful to counteract the damage elicited by HG in HRECs, and warranting further clinical evaluation of P2X7R antagonists for the treatment of diabetic macular edema.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Several analyses were performed to study GYY4137 effects by examining retinal lysates for key protein expressions along with plasma glutamate and glutathione estimations. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was monitored during GYY4137 treatment; barium sulfate and bovine serum albumin conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate (BSA-FITC) angiographies were performed for examining vasculature and its permeability post-treatment. Vision-guided behavior was also tested employing novel object recognition test (NORT) and light-dark box test (LDBT) recordings.CBS deficiency (CBS) coupled with HMD led disruption of methionine/homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism leading to hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) in CBS mice as reflected by increased Hcy, and s-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) levels. Unlike CBS, cystathionine-γ lyase (CSE), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) levels which were reduced but compensated by GYY4137 intervention. Heightened oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses were mitigated by GYY4137 effects along with enhanced glutathione (GSH) levels. Increased glutamate levels in CBS strain were prominent than WT mice and these mice also exhibited higher IOP that was lowered by GYY4137 treatment. CBS deficiency also resulted in vision-guided behavioral impairment as revealed by NORT and LDBT findings. Interestingly, GYY4137 was able to improve CBS mice behavior together with lowering their glutamate levels. Blood-retinal barrier (BRB) appeared compromised in CBS with vessels' leakage that was mitigated in GYY4137 treated group. This corroborated the results for occludin (an integral plasma membrane protein of the cellular ) stabilization.Findings reveal that HHcy-induced glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative damage, ER-stress and vascular permeability alone or together can compromise ocular health and that GYY4137 could serve as a potential therapeutic agent for treating HHcy induced ocular disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988524>Aberrant oligodendroglial-vascular interactions disrupt the blood-brain barrier, triggering CNS inflammation.</a></h1><p>Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is critical to initiation and perpetuation of disease in multiple sclerosis (MS). We report an interaction between oligodendroglia and vasculature in MS that distinguishes human white matter injury from normal rodent demyelinating injury. We find perivascular clustering of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in certain active MS lesions, representing an inability to properly detach from vessels following perivascular migration. Perivascular OPCs can themselves disrupt the BBB, interfering with astrocyte endfeet and endothelial  integrity, resulting in altered vascular permeability and an associated CNS inflammation. Aberrant Wnt tone in OPCs mediates their dysfunctional vascular detachment and also leads to OPC secretion of Wif1, which interferes with Wnt ligand function on endothelial  integrity. Evidence for this defective oligodendroglial-vascular interaction in MS suggests that aberrant OPC perivascular migration not only impairs their lesion recruitment but can also act as a disease perpetuator via disruption of the BBB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614968>Galactomannan Pentasaccharide Produced from Copra Meal Enhances  Integration of Epithelial Tissue through Activation of AMPK.</a></h1><p>Mannan oligosaccharide (MOS) is well-known as an effective fed supplement for livestock to increase their nutrients absorption and health status. Pentasaccharide of mannan (MOS5) was reported as a molecule that possesses the ability to increase  of epithelial tissue, but the structure and mechanism of action remains undetermined. In this study, the mechanism of action and structure of MOS5 were investigated. T84 cells were cultured and treated with MOS5 compared with vehicle and compound C, a '-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor. The results demonstrated that the ability of MOS5 to increase  integration was inhibited in the presence of dorsomorphine (compound C). Phosphorylation level of AMPK was elevated in MOS5 treated group as determined by Western blot analysis. Determination of MOS5 structure was performed using enzymatic mapping together with H, C NMR, and 2D-NMR analysis. The results demonstrated that the structure of MOS5 is a β-(1,4)-mannotetraose with α-(1,6)-galactose attached at the second mannose unit from non-reducing end.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31417573>Liver X Receptor Alpha Is Important in Maintaining Blood-Brain Barrier Function.</a></h1><p>Dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of several neuroinflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Potential players that regulate BBB function are the liver X receptors (LXRs), which are ligand activated transcription factors comprising two isoforms, LXRα, and LXRβ. However, the role of LXRα and LXRβ in regulating BBB (dys)function during neuroinflammation remains unclear, as well as their individual involvement. Therefore, the goal of the present study is to unravel whether LXR isoforms have different roles in regulating BBB function under neuroinflammatory conditions. We demonstrate that LXRα, and not LXRβ, is essential to maintain barrier integrity . Specific knockout of LXRα in brain endothelial cells resulted in a more permeable barrier with reduced expression of . Additionally, the observed dysfunction was accompanied by increased endothelial inflammation, as detected by enhanced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) and increased transendothelial migration of monocytes toward inflammatory stimuli. To unravel the importance of LXRα in BBB function , we made use of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) MS mouse model. Induction of EAE in a constitutive LXRα knockout mouse and in an endothelial specific LXRα knockout mouse resulted in a more severe disease score in these animals. This was accompanied by higher numbers of infiltrating leukocytes, increased endothelial VCAM-1 expression, and decreased expression of the  molecule claudin-. Together, this study reveals that LXRα is indispensable for maintaining BBB integrity and its immune quiescence. Targeting the LXRα isoform may help in the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent BBB dysfunction, and thereby neuroinflammatory disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208230>Initiating TrkB/Akt Signaling Cascade Preserves Blood-Brain Barrier after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Rats.</a></h1><p>The integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a vital role in affecting the prognosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This study aimed to investigate activation of the Tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB) and its downstream signaling pathway on preserving BBB breakdown after experimental SAH. An endovascular perforation SAH model was applied. N-[2-(-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl) ethyl]-2- oxopiperidine-3-carboxamide (HIOC), the derivative of N-acetyl serotonin (NAS), was intracerebroventricularly administered 3 h after SAH induction. The neurologic scores and brain water content were evaluated in an outcome study. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining were used to investigate the mechanism. The results indicated that HIOC activated the TrkB/Akt pathway, increased the  expression, improved neurologic deficits, and ameliorated brain edema after SAH. Thus, we conclude that initiating the TrkB/Akt signaling cascade preserves BBB breakdown after experimental SAH in rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672757>Circulating Plasma Exosomes in Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Reverse-Dipping Blood Pressure.</a></h1><p>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) increases the risk of abnormal non-dipping 24-hour blood pressure profile, an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). We examined differential exosomal miRNA expression in untreated OSA patients with normal dipping blood pressure (NDBP) and reverse dipping blood pressure (RDBP; an extreme form of non-dipping) to understand the mechanisms underlying non-dipping blood pressure in OSA.46 patients (RDBP, n=15  NDBP, n=31) matched for OSA severity (respiratory event index, 32.6±22. h  32.2±18.1 h, p=0.9), age (54.8±12.9  49±9.9 years, p=0.09) and body mass index (36.2±6.6 kg·m  34.4±6.8 kg·m, p=0.4) were included. Plasma exosomes were characterised by flow cytometry, and functional  reporter assays were conducted on cultured endothelial cells. Exosome miRNA cargo was profiled with microarrays followed by bioinformatics analyses.Exosomes from RDBP patients increased the permeability of endothelial cell  and adhesion molecule expression. Principal component analyses of miRNA array data showed strict separation and identification of the two groups. A restricted and validated signature of exosomal miRNAs were identified in RDBP  NDBP group. Their predicted target genes involved PI3K-Akt (p=0.004), Ras (p=3.42E-05), Wnt (p=0.003), and HIF-1 signalling (p=0.04), inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels (p=0.01), and several cancer-related pathways.Patients with RDBP have altered miRNA cargo in circulating exosomes that invoke  endothelial dysfunction. A selected number of circulating exosomal miRNAs play an important role in abnormal circadian regulation of blood pressure and may provide prognostic biomarkers of CVD risk in OSA.Copyright ©ERS 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30969479>The GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide protects against oxidized LDL-induced endothelial inflammation and dysfunction via KLF2.</a></h1><p>Cardiovascular complications are the major causes of the mortality and morbidities in diabetic patients. The diabetic patients have an increased risk of developing atherosclerosis, which could lead to heart attack and stroke. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are a class of potent anti-glycemic agents to treat diabetes. Recently, several GLP-1 receptor agonists have been found to have cardiovascular benefit independent of their glucose lowing ability. Liraglutide is one of clinically approved effective GLP-1 receptor agonists. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanism of Liraglutide against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) in cultured endothelial cells. Our data show that Liraglutide treatment ameliorates ox-LDL caused reduction of the transcriptional factor KLF2. In the same experiment, Liraglutide also rescues ox-LDL induced reduction of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase extracellular signal regulated kinase  (ERK5) phosphorylation, and blockage of ERK5 activity by its inhibitor XMD8-92 abolishes the protection of Liraglutide on KLF2 expression. These facts suggest that the action of Liraglutide on endothelial KLF2 is dependent on ERK5. Liraglutide also recovers ox-LDL caused reduction of endothelial  protein Occludin and ameliorates ox-LDL induced endothelial monolayer permeability increase. On the other hand, Liraglutide inhibits ox-LDL induced expression of vascular adhesion molecules (E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1), and prevents ox-LDL induced attachment of monocytes adhesion to endothelial cells. Moreover, Liraglutide mitigates ox-LDL triggered reduction of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and NO release. Collectively, our study provides multiple facets of the mechanisms that Liraglutide is a protective agent in endothelial cells and has the potential implication in therapeutic usage of vascular complication in diabetes patients.© 2019 IUBMB Life, 71(9):1347-1354, 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191497>Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Brain Endothelial Cells as a Cellular Model to Study  Infection.</a></h1><p>Meningococcal meningitis is a severe central nervous system infection that occurs when  () penetrates brain endothelial cells (BECs) of the meningeal blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier.

Autophagy of epithelial cells maintains homeostasis of the intestinal barrier by inhibiting apoptosis and stimulating degradation of the  protein claudin-2. This study investigated the effects and mechanism of activity of sinensetin, a polymethylated flavonoid isolated from tangerine peel and citrus, on intestinal barrier dysfunction in colitis. Animal model of colitis were established by intracolonic administration of 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and oral treatment with dextran sulfate sodium. Epithelial barrier function was evaluated by measuring the serum recovery of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-4 kD dextran in vivo and transepithelial electrical resistance in Caco-2 cells, respectively. Epithelial cell autophagy assayed by autophagosome formation and expression of autophagy-related protein. Sinensetin reversed colitis-associated increase in intestinal permeability, significantly promoted epithelial cell autophagy, and further decreased epithelial cell apoptosis, and reduced mucosal claudin-2. Sinenstetin alleviated colitis symptoms rats and mice with colitis. Knockdown of ' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) reversed the promotion of epithelial autophagy by sinensetin. In conclusion, sinensetin significantly alleviated intestinal barrier dysfunction in colitis by promoting epithelial cell autophagy, and further inhibiting apoptosis and promoting claudin-2 degradation.

Previously, we demonstrated that the Aβ fraction 25-35 (Aβ) increases RAGE expression in the rat hippocampus, likely contributing to its neurotoxic effects. However, it is still debated if the interaction of Aβ with RAGE compromises the BBB function in Alzheimer' disease (AD). Here, we evaluated the effects of Aβ in an established in vitro model of the BBB. Rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (rBMVECs) were treated with 20 μM active Aβ or the inactive Aβ (control), for 24 h. Exposure to Aβ significantly decreased cell viability, increased cellular necrosis, and increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggered a decrease in the enzyme glutathione peroxidase when compared to the control condition. Aβ also increased BBB permeability by altering the expression of  proteins (decreasing zonula occludens-1 and increasing occludin). Aβ induced monolayer disruption and cellular disarrangement of the BBB, with RAGE being highly expressed in the zones of disarrangement. Together, these data suggest that Aβ-induces toxicity by compromising the functionality and integrity of the BBB in vitro.

Current treatments rely upon donor allogeneic tissue to replace the damaged CE. A donor cornea shortage necessitates the development of biomaterials, enabling in vitro expansion of corneal endothelial cells (CECs). This study investigated the use of a synthetic peptide hydrogel using poly-ε-lysine (pεK), cross-linked with octanedioic-acid as a potential substrate for CECs expansion and CE grafts. PεK hydrogel properties were optimised to produce a substrate which was thin, transparent, porous and robust. A human corneal endothelial cell line (HCEC-12) attached and grew on pεK hydrogels as confluent monolayers after 7 days, whereas primary porcine CECs (pCECs) detached from the pεK hydrogel. Pre-adsorption of collagen I, collagen IV and fibronectin to the pεK hydrogel increased pCEC adhesion at 24 h and confluent monolayers formed at 7 days. Minimal cell adhesion was observed with pre-adsorbed laminin, chondroitin sulphate or commercial FNC coating mix (fibronectin, collagen and albumin). Functionalisation of the pεK hydrogel with synthetic cell binding peptide H-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Gly-Gly-OH (RGD) or α2β1 integrin recognition sequence H-Asp-Gly-Glu-Ala-OH (DGEA) resulted in enhanced pCEC adhesion with the RGD peptide only. pCECs grown in culture at  weeks on RGD pεK hydrogels showed zonula occludins 1 staining for  and expression of sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphase, suggesting a functional CE. These results demonstrate the pεK hydrogel can be tailored through covalent binding of RGD to provide a surface for CEC attachment and growth.

Endothelial cell β integrin receptors play a direct role in blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction through regulation of  proteins and infiltrating leukocytes, potentially mediated by β1 integrins. Following tandem transient common carotid artery/middle cerebral artery occlusion on wild-type mice, we administered the integrin a5b1 inhibitor, ATN-161, intraperitoneal (IP) injection at 1 mg/kg acutely after reperfusion, on post-stroke day (PSD)1 and PSD2. Systemic changes (heart rate, pulse distension, and body temperature) were determined. Additionally, infarct volume and edema were determined by 2,3-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and magnetic resonance imaging, while neurological changes were evaluated using an 11-point Neuroscore. Brain immunohistochemistry was performed for claudin-, αβ1, IgG, and CD45 + cells, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed for matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), interleukin (IL)-1β, collagen IV, and CXCL12. ATN-161 significantly reduced integrin αβ1 expression in the surrounding peri-infarct region with no systemic changes. Infarct volume, edema, and functional deficit were significantly reduced in ATN-161-treated mice.

EV-A71 capsid protein VP1 mediates virus attachment and is the important virulence factor in the EV-A71pathogenesis. In this study, we explored the roles of VP1 in the permeability of blood-brain barrier (BBB). Sera albumin, Evans blue, and dextran leaked into brain parenchyma of the 1-week-old C57BL/6J mice intracranially injected with VP1 recombinant protein. VP1 also increased the permeability of the brain endothelial cells monolayer, an in vitro BBB model.  protein claudin- was reduced in the brain tissues or brain endothelial cells treated with VP1. In contrast, VP1 increased the expression of virus receptor vimentin, which could be blocked with VP1 neutralization antibody. Vimentin expression in the VP1-treated brain endothelial cells was regulated by TGF-β/Smad-3 and NF-κB signal pathways. Moreover, vimentin over-expression was accompanied with compromised BBB. From these studies, we conclude that EV-A71 virus capsid protein VP1 disrupted BBB and increased virus receptor vimentin, which both may contribute to the virus entrance into brain and EV-A71 CNS infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637977>The protective effect of selenium from heat stress-induced porcine small intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) injury is associated with regulation expression of selenoproteins.</a></h1><p>The present study compared the protective effect of sodium selenite (SS) and selenomethionine (SeMet) on heat stress (HS)-invoked porcine IPEC-J2 cellular damage and integrate potential roles of corresponding selenoprotein. Cells were cultured at 37°C until 80 % confluence and then subjected to four different conditions for 24 h: at 37°C (control), 41·°C (HS), 41·°C supplied with 0·42 µmol Se/L SS (SS), or SeMet (SeMet). HS significantly decreased cell viability, up-regulated mRNA and protein levels of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and down-regulated mRNA and protein levels of -related proteins (claudin-1 (CLDN-1) and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1)). HS-induced cell injury was associated with the up-regulation (P < 0·05) of six inflammation-related genes and fourteen selenoprotein encoding genes and down-regulation (P < 0·05) of two inflammation-related genes and five selenoprotein encoding genes. Compared with the HS group, SS and SeMet supplementation resulted in an increase (P < 0·05) in cell viability, decreased (P < 0·05) mRNA expression of HSP70 and six inflammation-related genes and rescue (P < 0·05) of mRNA and protein levels of CLDN-1 and ZO-1. SS and SeMet supplementation changes the expressions of nineteen selenoprotein encoding genes in cells affected by HS. Both Se supplementation significantly recovered the protein level of glutathione peroxidase-1 and increased selenoprotein P in the IPEC-J2 cells under HS, respectively. In summary, Se supplementation alleviated the negative impact of HS on IPEC-J2 cells, and their cellular protective effect was associated with regulation expression of selenoproteins, and SeMet exhibited a better protective effect.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31329969>Effect of stocking density and dietary tryptophan on growth performance and intestinal barrier function in broiler chickens.</a></h1><p>The objective of the present experiment was to investigate the effect of stocking density (SD) and dietary supplementation of crystalline tryptophan (Trp) on growth performance and intestinal barrier function in broiler chickens raised in a floor pen. The experiment was conducted using a completely randomized design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement consisting of 2 different SD and 2 supplemental levels of dietary Trp. A total of 1,140 Ross 308 broiler chickens at 21 d of age were allotted to 1 of 4 treatments with  replicates. Low SD (9 birds/m2) and high SD (18 birds/m2) were achieved by raising different number of birds per identical floor pen (2.0 m × 2.4 m). The basal diet was formulated with no supplemental Trp in diets to meet or exceed nutrient recommendation of the Ross 308 manual. The calculated concentrations of total Trp and digestible Trp in the basal diet were 0.19 and 0.16%, respectively. The other diet was prepared by adding 0.16% crystalline Trp to the basal diet. Diets were fed to birds for 21 d. At the end of the experiment, 2 birds per replicate were euthanized to collect tissue samples for further analyses. Results indicated that there were no interactions between SD and dietary Trp for all measurements. For the main effects, birds raised at a low SD had greater (P < 0.01) body weight gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency than those raised at a high SD. However, supplementation of dietary Trp had no effect on broiler performance. Furthermore, there were no main effects of SD and dietary Trp on intestinal barrier functions. In conclusion, broiler chickens raised in a floor pen with a high SD (18 birds/m2) have decreased growth performance with little changes in intestinal barrier functions. Supplementation of dietary Trp at 0.16% has no positive effect on broiler chickens raised in a floor pen with either a low or high SD.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31473343>Dendrobium officinale polysaccharides alleviate colon tumorigenesis via restoring intestinal barrier function and enhancing anti-tumor immune response.</a></h1><p>Intact epithelial barrier and mucosal immune system are crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Previous study indicated that Dendrobium officinale polysaccharides (DOPS) can regulate immune responses and inflammation to alleviate experimental colitis. However, it remains largely unknown whether DOPS can suppress AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer (CRC) model through its direct impact on intestinal barrier function and intestinal mucosal immunity. Here, we demonstrated the therapeutic action of DOPS for CRC model and further illustrated its underlying mechanisms. Treatment with -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA) and DOPS significantly improved the clinical signs and symptoms of chronic colitis, relieve colon damage, suppress the formation and growth of colon tumor in CRC mice. Moreover, administration of DOPS effectively preserved the intestinal barrier function via reducing the loss of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin in adjacent tissues and carcinomatous tissues. Further studies demonstrated that DOPS improved the metabolic ability of tumor infiltrated CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and reduced the expression of PD-1 on CTLs to enhance the anti-tumor immune response in the tumor microenvironments (TME). Together, the conclusions indicated that DOPS restore intestinal barrier function and enhance intestinal anti-tumor immune response to suppress CRC, which may be a novel strategy for the prevention and treatment of CRC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
