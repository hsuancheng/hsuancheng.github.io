Failing to control HbA1c levels can accelerate the development of complications in patients with . Although metabolite profiles associated with HbA1c level in  patients have been characterized using different platforms, more studies using high-throughput technology will be helpful to identify additional metabolites related to . Type 2  (T2D) patients were divided into two groups based on the HbA1c level: normal (HbA1c ≤6%) and high (HbA1c ≥9%) in both discovery and replication sets. A targeted metabolomics approach was used to quantify serum metabolites and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify significant differences between groups. The concentrations of 22 metabolites differed significantly between the two groups in the discovery set. In the replication set, the levels of 21 metabolites, including 16 metabolites identified in the discovery set, differed between groups. Among these, concentrations of eleven amino acids and one phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysoPC a C16:1, were higher and four metabolites, including three PCs (PC ae C36:1, PC aa C26:0, PC aa C34:2) and hexose, were lower in the group with normal HbA1c group than in the group with high HbA1c. Metabolites with high concentrations in the normal HbA1c group, such as glycine, valine, and PCs, may contribute to reducing HbA1c levels in patients with T2D. The metabolite signatures identified in this study provide insight into the mechanisms underlying changes in HbA1c levels in T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695465>How Western Diet And Lifestyle Drive The Pandemic Of Obesity And Civilization Diseases.</a></h2><p>Westernized populations are plagued by a plethora of chronic non-infectious degenerative diseases, termed as "civilization diseases", like obesity, , cardiovascular diseases, cancer, autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease and many more, diseases which are rare or virtually absent in hunter-gatherers and other non-westernized populations. There is a growing awareness that the cause of this amazing discrepancy lies in the profound changes in diet and lifestyle during recent human history. This paper shows that the transition from Paleolithic nutrition to Western diets, along with lack of corresponding genetic adaptations, cause significant distortions of the fine-tuned metabolism that has evolved over millions of years of human evolution in adaptation to Paleolithic diets. With the increasing spread of Western diet and lifestyle worldwide, overweight and civilization diseases are also rapidly increasing in developing countries. It is suggested that the diet-related key changes in the developmental process include an increased production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress, development of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, low-grade inflammation and an abnormal activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system, all of which play pivotal roles in the development of diseases of civilization. In addition, diet-related epigenetic changes and fetal programming play an important role. The suggested pathomechanism is also able to explain the well-known but not completely understood close relationship between obesity and the wide range of comorbidities, like type 2 , cardiovascular disease, etc., as diseases of the same etiopathology. Changing our lifestyle in accordance with our genetic makeup, including diet and physical activity, may help prevent or limit the development of these diseases.© 2019 Kopp.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695459>Association between glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and the lipid profile in patients with type 2  at a tertiary care hospital: a retrospective study.</a></h2><p>To investigate the association between glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and the lipid profile in patients with type 2  (T2DM) at a tertiary care hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (SA).The present retrospective cross-sectional study was accomplished at the Faculty of Medicine, King Abdulaziz University (KAU), Jeddah, SA, between April and July 2018. There were 206 T2DM patients selected for the study (141 females and 65 males), and the data were collected through a review of the electronic profiles of patients by using the medical electronic file system used at the KAU Hospital. Biochemical data such as fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c and lipid profile, along with the patient's age, BMI and gender, were also taken from the electronic file system. The inclusion criteria allowed for only patients who were regularly seeing their physician and whose electronic file was up to date.The participants' data were analyzed gender-wise. The females had significantly higher values for BMI (=0.002), HbA1c (=0.009), triglycerides (TGs) (<0.001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (=0.002) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (<0.001) compared to the males. The study subjects were grouped according to their level of HbA1c (good glycemic index <7%, and poor glycemic index >7%). In both groups, no significant differences were found in any of the parameters other than TGs (=0.020) and HbA1c (<0.001). An analysis of the correlation between HbA1c and other parameters exhibited a significant correlation with TG (=0.16, =0.020), while no significant relationship was observed with the other variables. The linear regression results indicated that HbA1c values were associated with TGs (=0.020) and were independent of age, BMI, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and FPG levels.The glycated Hb was associated with TGs, and no significant association was found with age, BMI, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and FPG levels.© 2019 Alzahrani et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691944>Ramadan and Health.

PI incidence reached 7.9% on implant level and 13.2% on patient level. Implants diagnosed with PI and progressive bone loss displayed exceptionally vertical bone defect configuration (BDC). , smoking, regular maintenance, or a former periodontal infection did not show significant influence on the prevalence of peri-implant diseases. Patients with bruxism displayed significantly less PM and PI.Vertical BDC seems to correspond with active PI, wherefore we estimate such a defining factor of importance.

Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate recurrence-free survival (RFS) curves for first episode of UTI diagnosed in two groups: during and outside Ramadan, which were compared using Log-rank test for statistical inference. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify UTI recurrence factors (sex, age, age group, season, comorbidities, first UTI episode diagnosed during Ramadan, UTI requiring hospitalization, length of hospital stay, nosocomial UTI, clinical presentation).During the follow up, among the 867 patients with UTI, 105 (12.1%) developed a recurrent UTI one. The RFS median [95% confidence interval] was 60 [40 to 82] days. Survival curves showed that patients with UTI diagnosed during Ramadan had shorter RFS compared with those diagnosed outside of Ramadan (32 vs. 60 days, respectively, p=0.002). RF (hazard ratio = 2.96; p = 0.033) and  (hazard ratio =1.6; p = 0.033) were independently associated with UTI recurrence in multivariate Cox regression analysis.Recurrent UTI was a prevalent and challenging condition among patients with UTI.  and RF had a prognosis value for recurrence in UTI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695458>Regulation of alternative splicing in obesity-induced hypertension.</a></h2><p>Obesity is the result of genetics which predisposes an individual to obesity and environmental factors, resulting in excessive weight gain. A well-established linear relationship exists between hypertension and obesity. The combined burden of hypertension and obesity poses significant health and economic challenges. Many environmental factors and genetic traits interact to contribute to obesity-linked hypertension. These include excess sodium re-absorption or secretion by the kidneys, a hypertensive shift of renal-pressure and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Most individuals suffering from hypertension need drugs in order to treat their raised blood pressure, and while a number of antihypertensive therapeutic agents are currently available, 50% of cases remain uncontrolled. In order to develop new and effective therapeutic agents combating obesity-induced hypertension, a thorough understanding of the molecular events leading to adipogenesis is critical. With the advent of whole genome and exome sequencing techniques, new genes and variants which can be used as markers for obesity and hypertension are being identified. This review examines the role played by alternative splicing (AS) as a contributing factor to the metabolic regulation of obesity-induced hypertension. Splicing mutations constitute at least 14% of the disease-causing mutations, thus implicating polymorphisms that effect splicing as indicators of disease susceptibility. The unique transcripts resulting from the alternate splicing of mRNA encoding proteins that play a key role in contributing to obesity would be vital to gain a proper understanding of the genetic causes of obesity. A greater knowledge of the genetic basis for obesity-linked hypertension will assist in the development of appropriate diagnostic tests as well as the identification of new personalized therapeutic targets against obesity-induced hypertension.© 2019 Dlamini et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695464>Protective Effects Of Astragalus Polysaccharides On Oxidative Stress In High Glucose-Induced Or SOD2-Silenced H9C2 Cells Based On PCR Array Analysis.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress in cardiac myocytes is an important pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Previously, we reported that astragalus polysaccharide (APS) has protective effects against the oxidative stress of DCM. This study aimed to determine the effect of APS on the oxidative stress induced by hyperglycemia in H9C2 cells.Rat H9C2 cells were cultured in vitro and randomly divided into the control group, HG group, APS-HG group, siRNASOD2 group, and APS-siRNASOD2 group. The cellular ultrastructure was measured by transmission electron microscopy. Cell apoptosis was examined by TUNEL staining. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by a quantitative fluorescence assay (DHE). 8-OH-dG and nitrotyrosine, the indicators of oxidative stress injury, were detected by immunohistochemistry. A PCR array was used to evaluate the expression levels of 84 oxidative stress genes in cultured cells, and the PCR array results were partially verified by Western blot.APS treatment protected the H9C2 cell ultrastructure, reduced the level of cell apoptosis, inhibited cellular ROS production, and reduced the levels of oxidative stress injury indicators 8-OH-dG and nitrotyrosine in high glucose-induced or SOD2-silenced H9C2 cells. It also altered oxidative stress-related genes at the mRNA and protein levels.APS may improve antioxidant capacity and inhibit oxidative stress injury in high glucose induced H9C2 cells.© 2019 Sun et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695302>The impact of perinatal history in the occurrence of childhood obesity: a litera-ture review.</a></h2><p>It is widely accepted, that the increased prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity poses an important public health problem since it increases the risk for early onset of non-communicable diseases with potentially increased health complications during adulthood. Childhood obesity prevention is therefore of primary importance; hence it is mandatory to understand its main causes and identify the mechanisms associated with weight gain. Although its etiology can be partly attributed to genetic and behavioral factors, evidence from existing literature indicates that the perinatal environment may also increase the risk of childhood obesity; the latter, however, has not been thoroughly investigated and discussed.A literature search was conducted in scientific databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus) in order to reveal recent epidemiologic studies, with emphasis on works from the last decade. Studies whose primary or secondary object was the association between type of delivery, breastfeeding and/or gestational  with overweight and obesity in childhood and preadolescence were taken into account. Studies that did not meet the aim of the current review were excluded.The retrieved information revealed that there is a noteworthy association between perinatal factors and childhood and preadolescence overweight/obesity occurrence, though the exact pathways still need to be elucidated.Public health professionals should take into account perinatal determinants when estimating a child's risk of overweight and obesity development.

The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling pathway plays a central role in metabolism and energy homeostasis. Here, to investigate the role of AMPK in the protective effect of adiponectin against insulin resistance, we established the model of high-glucose (HG)- and high-lipid (HL)-induced insulin resistance in INS-1 pancreatic β cells. We found that 25mM of glucose and 0.4mM of palmitic acid treatment significantly increased cell apoptosis and impaired insulin secretion in INS-1 cells. However, recombinant human adiponectin dramatically reduced HG- and/or HL-induced cell apoptosis and greatly improved insulin secretion. Interestingly, adiponectin treatment also activated AMPK signalling pathway by increasing the phosphorylation of Thr172 in the AMPK α subunit; 10μM of compound C, a potent AMPK inhibitor, blocked the protective effects of adiponectin against HG/HL-induced insulin resistance. Furthermore, knockout experiments by CRISPR/Cas9 technology showed that AMPK α1, but not AMPK α2, is involved in the protective effects of adiponectin. Taken together, adiponectin reversed the effects of insulin resistance via AMPK α1, which provides a novel insight into the protective mechanism of adiponectin and may be used as a new strategy for the treatment of type 2 . SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Adiponectin can reverse the effects of insulin resistance and lower blood glucose levels. Here, adiponectin reduced HG/HL-induced cell apoptosis and greatly improved insulin secretion. These effects were blocked by AMPK inhibitor, compound C. Specifically, we found that AMPK α1, but not AMPK α2, mediates the protective effects of adiponectin, which provides a novel insight into the protective mechanism of adiponectin against insulin resistance.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691399>'It's got its own life, and you can't contain it': A qualitative study of patient and health professional experiences of  care.</a></h2><p>This paper explores the perspectives of patients and health professionals on facilitators and barriers to care in a  clinic in urban South Africa.Although much attention has been given to the science behind  management, a qualitative approach to exploring experiences, facilitators and barriers to care may have considerable value in understanding and improving  care.We conducted a qualitative study in the context of a three-year collaboration at a  clinic. The present study formed part of the preparatory phase to the larger project.Linguistically and culturally matched research assistants collected data over a period of 18 months. Methods included interviews, focus groups, ethnographic observations and informal discussions with 38 patients and health professionals. Data from each participant group were transcribed, translated and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis principles, and thereafter triangulated. The SRQR checklist was followed.Initial findings suggest that factors can be classified into three overarching themes: relationships, health systems and the interplay between disease and the lifeworld. System resource pressures, the nuances of team interactions and a complex healthcare site may adversely affect care, even at sites where there are elements of good practice.The collective psychosocial experience of patients appears to conflict with the biomedical approach to  management. The all-consuming nature of the disease, together with contextual and systemic factors, plays a significant role in influencing experiences of care.While systemic and contextual influences on experiences of  care may be difficult to modify, our study suggests a need to focus on ways of enhancing relationships within the clinic and seeking to understand the lifeworld of the patient.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692874>[Epidemiological profiles of diabetic ketoacidosis in the Emergency Department].</a></h2><p>Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a severe metabolic complication of .

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of glucose analytic error (bias and imprecision) on the misclassification of glucose meter results from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) using the CPS guidelines.A simulation dataset of true glucose values ( = 100 000) was derived by finite mixture model analysis of NICU glucose data ( = 23 749). Bias and imprecision were added to create measured glucose values. The percentages of measured glucose values that were misclassified at CPS action thresholds were determined by Monte Carlo simulation.Measurement biases ranging from -20 to +20 mg/dL combined with coefficients of variation 0% to 20% were evaluated to predict misclassification rates at 32, 36, and 47 mg/dL.

We report herein that the microRNA, miR-30, with three binding sites in a highly conserved region of its 3' UTR, operates as repressor of Mkrn3 to control pubertal onset. Hypothalamic miR-30b expression increased, while Mkrn3 mRNA and protein content decreased, during rat postnatal maturation. Neonatal estrogen exposure, causing pubertal alterations, enhanced hypothalamic Mkrn3 and suppressed miR-30b expression in female rats. Functional in vitro analyses demonstrated a strong repressive action of miR-30b on Mkrn3 3' UTR. Moreover, central infusion during the juvenile period of target site blockers, tailored to prevent miR-30 binding to Mkrn3 3' UTR, reversed the prepubertal down-regulation of hypothalamic Mkrn3 protein and delayed female puberty. Collectively, our data unveil a novel hypothalamic miRNA pathway, involving miR-30, with a prominent role in the control of puberty via Mkrn3 repression.

However, gastric emptying has previously been assessed using a stable isotope breath test technique, which cannot discriminate between slowing of gastric emptying and small intestinal absorption. This preload also may be useful in the management of postprandial hypotension. We evaluated the effects of a whey protein/guar preload on gastric emptying, glucose absorption, glycaemic/insulinaemic and blood pressure (BP) responses to an oral glucose load. Eighteen healthy older participants underwent measurements of gastric emptying (scintigraphy), plasma glucose and insulin, glucose absorption, superior mesenteric artery (SMA) flow, BP and heart rate (HR) after ingesting a 50 g glucose drink, with or without the preload. The preload reduced plasma glucose ( = 0.02) and serum 3-O-methylglucose (3-OMG) ( = 0.003), and increased plasma insulin ( = 0.03). There was no difference in gastric emptying or BP between the two days. The reduction in plasma glucose on the preload day was related to the reduction in glucose absorption (r = 0.71,  = 0.002). In conclusion, the glucose-lowering effect of the preload may relate to delayed small intestinal glucose absorption and insulin stimulation, rather than slowing of gastric emptying.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692240>Effect of Dapagliflozin, a Sodium-glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitor, on Gluconeogenesis in Proximal Renal Tubules.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effect of dapagliflozin, a SGLT- 2 inhibitor, on renal gluconeogenesis in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo.We treated HK-2 cells (human renal proximal tubule cells) and mouse primary renal proximal tubule cells with dapagliflozin, and evaluated the process of renal gluconeogenesis. We also examined the effect of dapagliflozin on renal gluconeogenesis in normoglycemic and hyperglycemic mice.Dapagliflozin enhanced renal gluconeogenesis in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. It increased PEPCK, G6Pase, PGC-1α, and pCREB expressions and decreased pFOXO1 expression in HK-2 cells, mouse primary renal proximal tubule cells, and renal cortex of mouse. Glutamine enhanced the gluconeogenic effect of dapagliflozin in HK-2 cells. Also, dapagliflozin increased  C-glutamine utilization in HK-2 cells. Glucagon did not affect dapagliflozin-induced enhancement in renal gluconeogenesis in HK-2 cells. SGLT2 gene knock-down with siRNA resulted in increase of gluconeogenic gene expression and associated transcription factors in HK-2 cells. Dapagliflozin reduced fasting plasma glucose level and improved oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance in high fat-fed hyperglycemic mice, although renal gluconeogenesis was enhanced.Dapagliflozin increased levels of gluconeogenic enzyme in the renal cortex and consequently increased renal gluconeogenesis, which is mediated by SGLT-2 inhibition.

We aimed to perform a meta-analysis of RCTs to evaluate efficacy and safety of DPP4 inhibitors compared with placebo/no treatment as add-on therapy to insulin in T2DM patients.Relevant studies were identified via a search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases. A fixed or random effect model was applied according to the heterogeneity.Overall, 22 RCTs with 6,957 T2DM patients were included. Addition of DPP4 inhibitors to insulin was associated with significantly reduced HbA1c as compared with controls (weighed mean difference [WMD]: -0.54%, <0.001). The benefits of DPP4 inhibitors as add-on therapy on HbA1c were independent of study design, follow-up duration, categories of DPP4 inhibitors used, and using of fixed/adjustable insulin doses as indicated by predefined subgroup analyses. Moreover, addition of DPP4 inhibitors to insulin was associated with significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (WMD: -0.47mmol/L, <0.001), postprandial glucose at 2 hrs (WMD: -2.03 mmol/L, <0.001), and daily dose of insulin (WMD: -2.73U/d, <0.001), while body weight (WMD: 0.02 g, =0.81) or risk of symptomatic hypoglycemia (risk ratio: 0.92, =0.37) were not affected.Addition of DPP4 inhibitors to insulin significantly improved the glycemic control in T2DM patients without further increasing the risk of weight gain and hypoglycemia.© 2019 Wang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694792>Current status of percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with atrial fibrillation: The Fushimi AF Registry.</a></h2><p>Antithrombotic therapies that are optimal for atrial fibrillation (AF) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have been studied but remain uncertain. We often encounter difficulties in choosing an appropriate antithrombotic therapy with antiplatelet agents after PCI in AF patients treated with oral anticoagulant due to a high CHADS score. Since there are no data on the incidences of PCI procedures in AF patients, we evaluated those incidences as well as the association between PCI and the CHADS score using data from the Fushimi AF Registry.The Fushimi AF Registry is a community-based prospective cohort study of AF patients in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, Japan. Follow-up data were available for 4325 patients, and the median follow-up was 3.6 (interquartile range: 1.9-5.9) years.There were 143 PCI procedures performed in 122 patients during follow-up, and 28 (20%) were emergent ones. The crude incidence of PCI procedures was 9.36 per 1000 person-years. At 1 and 3 years, the cumulative incidences of PCI were 46 (1.1%) and 85 (2.4%), respectively. As for 4 age groups: <65 (n = 765), 65-75 (n = 1359), 75-85 (n = 1586), and 85≤ years (n = 615), the rates of PCI were 0.4%, 1.4%, 1.4%, and 0.6% at 1 year, and were 1.4%, 2.7%, 2.8%, and 1.6% at 3 years, respectively. The incidence of PCI procedures in patients with a CHADS score ≥2 (n = 2651, 61.3%) was higher than that in patients with a CHADS score ≤1 (n = 1674, 38.7%). Among the factors making up the CHADS score, only  was associated with PCI procedures in patients with AF (hazard ratio, 1.95; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-2.83; p = 0.0005).About 1 in 100 AF patients underwent PCI annually, and patients with a CHADS score ≥2 were associated with higher incidences of PCI procedures.Copyright © 2019.

Patient had persistent cardiogenic shock postoperatively despite intra-aortic balloon pump and escalating pressor requirements. Electrocardiogram showed new ischemic changes and the patient was urgently taken to the catheterization lab for coronary angiography and placement of an Impella CP for higher degree of hemodynamic support via the left femoral artery. Due to limitations in vascular access the Impella CP sheath was utilized for vascular access for diagnostic angiography and coronary intervention concurrently with ongoing Impella CP support. The first obtuse marginal had severe proximal disease and was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a drug eluting stent. To our knowledge, this case is the first in which successful diagnostic angiography as well as multi-vessel PCI was performed via an Impella sheath while concurrently using the percutaneous mechanical circulatory support system of the Impella CP. Multiple guide catheters and a pigtail catheter were successfully passed via the Impella CP sheath to perform PCI. This novel method of vascular access could be an important tool to use in high-risk patients with limitations in access sites and decrease potential bleeding complications by limiting the number of arterial punctures.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695339>De-Intensification Of Blood Glucose Lowering Medication In People Identified As Being Over-Treated: A Mixed Methods Study.</a></h2><p>To evaluate if, one year after notification of possible overtreatment,  care providers de-intensified glucose-lowering medications and to gain insight into the opinions and beliefs of both care providers and patients regarding de-intensification.Mixed methods using routine care data from five health-care centres in the Netherlands.

However, limited data are available in the Gaza strip. This study was undertaken to evaluate the prevalence of MetS and its association with atherosclerotic risk factors and cardiovascular diseases among Gazan adults' community.A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2017, among all adults ≥25 years of age. Participants were selected by stratified cluster sampling method, in five governorates (urban, camps and rural) of Gaza strip. Questionnaires on socioeconomic status, lifestyle and cardiovascular risk factors were completed for 2107 participants. The cardiovascular diseases included clinical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), Lower extremity artery disease (LEAD diagnosed as ankle brachial index < 0.90) and history of stroke. MetS was defined based on the International  Federation criteria (IDF).Among participants, 864 (41%) fulfilled the definition of MetS higher in females than males (50% vs 39%). In both genders, MetS prevalence increased significantly with age (p<0.001). Subjects with MetS were more obese (73.0% vs 29.4%), hypertensive (49.9% vs 13.0%), diabetic (36.8% vs 5.8%) and had more often low physical activity (58.1% vs 41.3%). Additionally, lipids profiles disorders were more prevalent in cases with MetS. We found MetS significantly associated with all cardiovascular conditions with odd-ratio (95% CI) respectively at 2.4 (95% CI 1.8-3.4) for CAD, 1.5 (95% CI1.1-1.9) for LEAD and 2.1 (95% CI 1.3-3.5) for stroke.The MetS is highly prevalent in the Palestinian population, particularly among women.

TAK242 or short hairpin TLR4 (shTLR4) were employed to down-regulate TLR4. The effect of MFHAS1 knockdown or overexpression on fibrosis-related factors, inflammatory factors and TLR4 in MMCs were examined after transfecting with shRNA or MFHAS1 overexpressed plasmid, respectively. The expression levels of MFHAS1, inflammatory factors, fibrosis factors and TLR4 in db/db or STZ mice tissues and MMCs were examined by quantitative reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot. The effect of MFHAS1 overexpression in vivo was also evaluated. The expression of MFHAS1 in db/db or STZ mice and high glucose treated MMCs were significantly increased compared with normal control mice and low glucose treated MMCs. Overexpression of MFHAS1 inhibited the expression of inflammatory and fibrotic factors, while knockdown of MFHAS1 promoted them. MFHAS1 suppressed the activation of TLR4 pathway via inhibiting the expression of TLR4, and then alleviating inflammation and fibrosis in DN. MFHAS1 overexpression in vivo improved the symptoms of STZ-induced DN mice.The current study demonstrated that MFHAS1 relieved inflammation and renal fibrosis in DN mice via inhibiting TLR4.

Adipose tissue is considered one of the largest endocrine organs in the body as well as an active tissue for cellular reactions and metabolic homeostasis rather than an inert tissue only for energy storage. The functional pleiotropism of adipose tissue relies on its ability to synthesize and release a large number of hormones, cytokines, extracellular matrix proteins, and growth and vasoactive factors, which are collectively called adipokines known to influence a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. In the obese state, excessive visceral fat accumulation causes adipose tissue dysfunctionality that strongly contributes to the onset of obesity-related comorbidities. The mechanisms underlying adipose tissue dysfunction include adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia, increased inflammation, impaired extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis together with an altered secretion of adipokines.

Healing is a complex process and includes many steps that are regulated by coding and noncoding RNAs, proteins and other molecules. Nitric oxide (NO) is one of these small molecule regulators and its function has already been associated with inflammation and angiogenesis during adult healing.Our results showed that NO is also an essential component during embryonic scarless healing and acts via a previously unknown mechanism. NO is mainly produced during the early phase of healing and it is crucial for the expression of genes associated with healing. However, we also observed a late phase of healing, which occurs for several hours after wound closure and takes place under the epidermis and includes tissue remodelling that is dependent on NO. We also found that the NO is associated with multiple cellular metabolic pathways, in particularly the glucose metabolism pathway. This is particular noteworthy as the use of NO donors have already been found to be beneficial for the treatment of chronic healing defects (including those associated with ) and it is possible that its mechanism of action follows those observed during embryonic wound healing.Our study describes a new role of NO during healing, which may potentially translate to improved therapeutic treatments, especially for individual suffering with problematic healing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694556>Determinants of suboptimal long-term secondary prevention of acute myocardial infarction: the structural interview method and physical examinations.</a></h2><p>Secondary prevention after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) reduces morbidity and mortality, but suboptimal secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease is common.

The secondary preventive goals included are; blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg, LDL < 1.8 mmol/L, HbA1c < 48 mmol/mol, regular physical activity that causes sweating at least twice a week, non-smoking and BMI < 25 kg/m. Multivariable and univariable logistic regression models were applied to identify independent predictors of different secondary prevention achievements.Of the 200 patients (mean age 63.3 ± 9.7 years) included in the study, 159 (80%) were men. No common determinants were found in patients who failed to achieve at least six secondary prevention guideline-directed goals. For individual secondary prevention goals, several determinants were defined. Patients born in Sweden were less likely to achieve optimal lipid control [odds ratio (OR) 0.28 (95% confidence interval, CI 0.12-0.63)]. Younger (≤ 65 years) [OR 0.24 (95% CI 0.07-0.74)] and unemployed patients [OR 0.23 (95% CI 0.06-0.82)] were less likely to be non-smokers. Patients with  [OR 0.21 (95% CI 0.04-0.98)] or with a walking aid [OR 0.23 (95% CI 0.07-0.71)] were less likely to achieve an optimal body mass index (BMI < 25). Living alone was an independent predictor of achieving regular physical activity [OR 1.94 (95% CI 1.02-3.69)].Long-term secondary prevention remained suboptimal 2 years after an AMI. Causes are likely multifactorial, with no single determinant for all six guideline-recommended preventive goals. Therefore a tailored comprehensive assessment should be requested and updated and treatment of risk factors should be applied.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697934>Aloe-emodin inhibits osteogenic differentiation and calcification of mouse vascular smooth muscle cells.</a></h2><p>Vascular calcification increased the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney diseases, and . However, viable therapeutic methods to target vascular calcification are limited. Aloe-emodin (AE), an anthraquinone is a natural compound found in the leaves of Aloe-vera. In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanism of AE in the calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and murine thoracic aorta. We demonstrate that AE repressed not only the phenotypes of Ca induced calcification but also level of calcium in VSMCs. AE has no effect on cell viability in VSMC cells. Alizarin red and von Kossa stainings and calcium quantification showed that Ca induced vascular calcification is significantly decreased by AE in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, AE attenuated Ca induced calcification through inhibiting osteoblast differentiation genes such as SMAD4, collagen 1α, osteopontin (OPN), Runt-related transcription factor (RUNX-2) and Osterix. AE also suppressed Ca induced osteoblast-related protein expression including collagen 1α, bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2), RUNX-2 and smooth muscle actin (SMA). Furthermore, Alizarin red, von Kossa stainings and calcium quantification showed that AE significantly inhibited the calcification of ex vivo ring formation in murine thoracic aorta, and markedly inhibited vitamin D induced medial aorta calcification in vivo. Taken together, our findings suggest that AE may have therapeutic potential for the prevention of vascular calcification program.Copyright © 2019.

In fact, older patients will soon constitute the majority of patients with T2D in most developed countries. The higher prevalence of T2D in older individuals is seen in both men and women and across racial and ethnic groups. However, certain ethnic groups are disproportionately affected and successful strategies must account for these fundamental differences. T2D in old age is associated with traditional -associated complications including micro- and macro vascular disease, but is also closely related to numerous other comorbidities including cognitive impairment, urinary incontinence, sarcopenia, and increased fall risk. An overall state of chronic inflammation and dysregulated immune system may underlie these increased risks; yet our understanding of immunometabolism during the aging process remains incomplete. In addition, optimal recognition and treatment of  in the elderly is hampered by a lack of relevant, high-quality studies, as the majority of clinical trial data establishing risk profiles, glycemic targets, and therapeutic interventions for T2D are not applicable for large segments of the older patient population. Simply acknowledging this gap is inadequate. We need strong evidence-based data upon which to successfully identify diabetic patients and then intervene in ways that are targeted to specific individuals within a heterogeneous group of elderly patients with T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695851>Graphene quantum dots rescue protein dysregulation of pancreatic β-cells exposed to human islet amyloid polypeptide.</a></h2><p>The amyloid aggregation of peptides and proteins is a hallmark of neurological disorders and type 2 . Human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), co-secreted with insulin by pancreatic β-cells, plays dual roles in both glycemic control and the pathology of type 2 . While IAPP can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and modulate cellular autophagy, apoptosis and extracellular matrix metabolism, no data is available concerning intracellular protein expression upon exposure to the polypeptide. More surprisingly, how intracellular protein expression is modulated by nanoparticle inhibitors of protein aggregation remains entirely unknown. In this study, we first examined the changing proteomes of βTC6, a pancreatic β-cell line, upon exposure to monomeric, oligomeric and fibrillar IAPP, and detailed cellular protein expression rescued by graphene quantum dots (GQDs), an IAPP inhibitor. We found that 29 proteins were significantly dysregulated by the IAPP species, while majority of these proteins were nucleotide-binding proteins. Collectively, our liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry, fluorescence quenching, helium ion microscopy, cytotoxicity and discreet molecular dynamics simulations data revealed a remarkable capacity of GQDs in regulating aberrant protein expression through H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions, pointing to nanomedicine as a new frontier against human amyloid diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696343>Updates from the Evidence Base Examining Association between Periodontal Disease and Type 2 : Current Status and Clinical Relevance.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological surveillance documents an escalating epidemic prevalence of both type 2  (T2DM) and periodontal disease (PD).

MicroRNAs have recently been considered as key regulators of many biological processes, such as cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. However, the effect of miR-22 expression by targeting IL6 receptor (IL6R) in T2DM and potential molecular mechanism involved remains to be elucidated. The present study aimed to explore the regulatory mechanism of miR-22 by targeting IL6R in pancreatic beta-cells viability and apoptosis of T2DM.The expressions of miR-22, IL6R and apolipoprotein (apoA1, apoB and apoE) were examined by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). Pancreatic beta-cells were transiently transfected with a miR-22 mimic or si-IL6R plasmid which validated with qRT-PCR to analyze the expression of miR-22 or IL6R. Cell viability, apoptosis and protein expression levels were determined by CCK-8, flow cytometry and Western blotting, respectively.The proportion of INS-1E cell apoptosis was increased in islets of diabetic rats. Furthermore, miR-22 was downregulated and IL6R was upregulated in both diabetic serum and glucose-induced INS-1E cells. miR-22 overexpression or IL6R inhibition significantly strengthened cell viability and reduced the expression of apoptosis-related proteins to suppress cell apoptosis. IL6R was demonstrated as a target gene of miR-22 which could negatively regulate IL6R expression. Moreover, phosphorylation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway was activated by miR-22 overexpression or IL6R inhibition to strengthen the viability and suppress apoptosis of INS-1E cells.This study indicated that miR-22 strengthened the viability and suppressed apoptosis of INS-1E cells, partly by down-regulation of IL6R through the activation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway.© 2019 Wu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693818>Teplizumab in Relatives at Risk for Type 1 .

The animals were randomly divided into four groups: control, control + isorhamnetin, diabetic, diabetic + isorhamnetin. Isorhamnetin at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight was intraperitoneally administrated once a day for 12 weeks. Formalin and tail immersion tests were performed to evaluate the severity of pain. Astrogliosis markers such as GFAP and APO-E4, DNA fragments, MDA level, and TNFα expressions were evaluated using ELISA assay. Neuronal density in the hippocampus region was evaluated using Nissl staining. The method of Ellman and fluorescent probe 2, 7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was used to measure brain acetyl-cholinesterase activity and detect reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RNS and ROS), respectively.Isorhamnetin reduced pain, blood glucose levels, and increased body weight significantly compared to control. Moreover, isorhamnetin inhibited astroglial activation, acetyl-cholinesterase activity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation.These findings suggested that isorhamnetin has potential effects as neuroprotective agents against -related changes in the brain.Copyright © 2019.

It has been suggested that  is associated with pyroptosis, a type of inflammatory programmed cell death. Long noncoding RNA KCNQ1OT1 is involved in pathophysiological mechanisms of diabetic complications, including diabetic cardiomyopathy and diabetic retinopathy. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of KCNQ1OT1 in diabetic corneal endothelial keratopathy. Here, we reveal that KCNQ1OT1 and pyroptosis can be triggered in diabetic human and rats corneal endothelium, along with the high glucose-treated corneal endothelial cells. However, miR-214 expression was substantially decreased  and in experiments with cultured cells. LDH assay verified pyroptosis in high glucose-treated cells. Bioinformatics prediction and luciferase assays showed that KCNQ1OT1 may bind miR-214 to regulate the expression of caspase-1. We further transfectec miR-214 mimic and inhibitor into the high glucose-treated corneal endothelial cells. The results showed that upregulation of miR-214 attenuated pyroptosis; conversely, knockdown of miR-214 promoted it. In addition, KCNQ1OT1 knockdown by a small interfering RNA decreased pyroptosis factors expressions, but enhanced miR-214 expression. To understand the mechanisms underlying the pre-pyroptotic properties of KCNQ1OT1, si-KCNQ1OT1 was co-transfected with or without miR-214 inhibitor. The results showed that pyroptosis was repressed after silencing KCNQ1OT1, but was reversed by co-transfection with miR-214 inhibitor, suggesting that KCNQ1OT1 mediated pyroptosis induced by high glucose via targeting miR-214. Therefore, the KCNQ1OT1/miR-214/caspase-1 signaling pathway represents a new mechanism of diabetic corneal endothelial keratopathy, and KCNQ1OT1 could potentially be a novel therapeutic target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692093>Lactate Efflux from Intervertebral Disc Cells is Required for Maintenance of Spine Health.</a></h2><p>Maintenance of glycolytic metabolism is postulated to be required for health of the spinal column. In the hypoxic tissues of the intervertebral disc and glycolytic cells of vertebral bone, glucose is metabolized into pyruvate for ATP generation and reduced to lactate to sustain redox balance. The rise in intracellular H /lactate concentrations are balanced by plasma-membrane monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). Using MCT4 null mice and human tissue samples, complimented with genetic and metabolic approaches, we determine that H /lactate efflux is critical for maintenance of disc and vertebral bone health. Mechanistically, MCT4 maintains glycolytic and TCA cycle flux and intracellular pH homeostasis in the nucleus pulposus compartment of the disc, where HIF-1α directly activates an intronic enhancer in SLC16A3. Ultimately, our results provide support for research into lactate as a diagnostic biomarker for chronic, painful disc degeneration. This article is protected by copyright.

They were randomly assigned to either control (n=15), resistance (n=15), and EPN (n=15) groups. Both experimental groups were trained for 12 weeks (three sessions per week). EPN group did peripheral neuropathic exercises (12 lower extremity movements), and the resistance group performed their exercises with a 30% repetition maximum. During the intervention period, the control group only performed their daily activities. Blood samples were taken in both pre-test and post-test to investigate the levels of Tumor necrosis-α (TNF-α), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), C Reactive Protein (CRP), fast blood glucose (FBG) and Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Complications of diabetic neuropathy were measured using the Michigan questionnaire and the Monofilament 10 g. In order to measure the balance, De Morton mobility index (DEMMI) was used.The statistical analyses showed a significant decrease of FBG and HbA1c in the two experimental groups, as compared to the control group. TNF-α and CRP levels were decreased in both EPN and resistance groups, as compared to the control group. The observed increase in the serum IL-10 levels of the two experimental groups was not, however, significant, as shown in intra-group and inter-group comparisons.

Current assays feature good performance at intermediate and high dabigatran concentrations but show limited accuracy at low concentrations. This area requires more attention as clinical decision threshold values currently lie at 30 and 50 ng/ml. The objective of the study was to evaluate and compare diagnostic performance of dabigatran assays at these thresholds. Dabigatran concentrations of 293 plasma samples taken from 50 patients were measured with the INNOVANCE direct thrombin inhibitor assay (DTI) from Siemens, the Biophen direct thrombin inhibitor assay (BDTI), the BDTI using a low range calibrator (BDTI-low), the Hemoclot direct thrombin inhibitor assay (HTI) and an ecarin clotting time assay (ECT). Assay results were compared to ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), and test characteristics were calculated for thresholds of 30 and 50 ng/ml. DTI, BDTI-low and ECT showed very strong correlation and high agreement with UPLC-MS/MS and an improved determination of low dabigatran concentrations.

The mice with blood glucose level higher than 300 mg/dL following HFD and a single dose of STZ were used for the experiment. The T2DM mice showed increases in body mass, blood glucose and insulin levels, reductions in spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis, production of antioxidative enzymes, and disturbed lipid profile. These alterations were all ameliorated by administration of nesfatin-1 at 20 μg/Kg BW for 15 days. Nesfatin-1 treatment also increased the production of testosterone (T), improved insulin sensitivity, and effectively ameliorated the testicular aberrations, and increased spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis. In addition, nesfatin-1 treatment upregulated the PCNA and Bcl2 expression and inhibited the caspase-3 and prohibitin expression in T2DM mice. Nesfatin-1 increased insulin receptor (IR) and GLUT8 expressions, and lactate production, the changes that further substantiate the increase of energy influx to the testis.Altogether, the results suggest the ameliorative effect of nesfatin-1 against T2DM-associated testicular dysfunctions and improved insulin sensitivity along with promoting T production and fertility in T2DM mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698080>Increased inflammation, oxidative stress and a reduction in antioxidant defense enzymes in perivascular adipose tissue contribute to vascular dysfunction in type 2 .</a></h2><p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounds most large blood vessels and plays an important role in vascular homeostasis. The present study was conducted to investigate the contribution of PVAT to vascular dysfunction in a rat model of type 2 .Several in vivo parameters such as lipid profile (total cholesterol and triglyceride systemic levels), fasting glucose levels, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (through glucose and insulin tolerance tests, respectively) were determined in Goto-Kakizaki (GK) diabetic rats and compared with control Wistar rats. At the vascular level, endothelial dependent and independent relaxation and contraction studies were performed in aortic rings in the absence (PVAT-) or in the presence (PVAT+) of thoracic PVAT. We also evaluated vascular oxidative stress and performed western blots, PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis of cytokines and various enzymes in PVAT.Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine, assessed by wire myography, was impaired in GK rats and improved by the antioxidant TEMPOL and by the TLR4 inhibitor, CLI-095 suggesting an increase in oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, vascular superoxide and peroxynitrite production was increased in the vascular wall of diabetic rats, accompanied by reduced nitric oxide bioavailability. The presence of PVAT had an anti-contractile effect in response to phenylephrine in Wistar rats that was lost in GK rats. Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that PVAT phenotype shifts, under diabetic conditions, towards a proinflammatory (with increment in CRP, CCL2, CD36), pro-oxidant (increased levels of aldose reductase, and reduced levels of antioxidant deference enzymes) and vasoconstriction state.Our data suggest that this rat model of type 2  is associated with perivascular adipose dysfunction that contributes to oxidative stress, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.Copyright © 2019.

Aging, as a complex process characterized by graduated senescence, triggers various pathways such as oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, metabolism dysfunction, but also telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction and deregulated autophagy. A better understanding of the senescence underlying mechanisms may lead to the development of new therapeutic targets and strategies for the age-related pathologies and extend the healthy lifespan. Modulating lifestyle risk factors and adopting healthy dietary patterns remain powerful tools which may delay the aging process, decrease age-associated co-morbidities and mortality, increase life expectancy, and, consequently, prevent the development of the cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, such a strategy represents the most cost-effective approach, and the subjects' quality of life may be significantly improved. An integrated, personalized approach targeting at cardiometabolic aging and frailty is suggested in daily clinical practice. However, it should be started from an early age, while there is a need for further well designed and controlled studies in order to elucidate a link between the time of feeding, longevity and cardiovascular prevention. In the future, it is expecting that the pharmacological treatment in cardioprotective management will be necessary accompanied by equally important lifestyle interventions and adjunctive exercise.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694080>An Age of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitor Priority: Are We Ready?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696324>Quality of life in chronic conditions using patient-reported measures and biomarkers: a DEA analysis in type 1 .</a></h2><p>A chronic disease impacts a patient's daily life, with the burden of symptoms and managing the condition, and concerns of progression and disease complications. Such aspects are captured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measures (PROM), assessments of e.g. wellbeing. Patient-Reported Experience Measures (PREM) assess patients' experiences of healthcare and address patient preferences. Biomarkers are useful for monitoring disease activity and treatment effect and determining risks of progression and complications, and they provide information on current and future health. Individuals may differ in which among these aspects they consider important. We aimed to develop a measure of quality of life using biomarkers, PROM and PREM, that would provide an unambiguous ranking of individuals, without presuming any specific set of importance weights. We anticipated it would be useful for studying needs and room for improvement, estimating the effects of interventions and comparing alternatives, and for developing healthcare with a broad focus on the individual. We wished to examine if efficiency analysis could be used for this purpose, in an application to individuals with type 1 .We used PROM and PREM data linked to registry data on risk factors, in a large sample selected from the National  Registry in Sweden. Efficiency analysis appears useful for evaluating the situation of individuals with type 1 . Quality of life was estimated as efficiency, which differed by age. The contribution of different components to quality of life was heterogeneous, and differed by gender, age and duration of . Observed quality of life shortfall was mainly due to inefficiency, and to some extent due to the level of available inputs.The efficiency analysis approach can use patient-reported outcomes measures, patient-reported experience measures and comorbidity risk factors to estimate quality of life with a broad focus on the individual, in individuals with type 1 . The approach enables ranking and comparisons using all these aspects in parallel, and allows each individual to express their own view of which aspects are important to them. The approach can be used for policy regarding interventions on inefficiency as well as healthcare resource allocation, although currently limited to type 1 .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693512>The Effect of Metformin on Prognosis in Patients With Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer Associated With Type 2 .</a></h2><p>This study examined the effect of metformin use on the prognosis of gastric cancer patients.The study population comprised 2187 patients who underwent curative gastrectomy for the treatment of gastric cancer.

Audits that comprised 13 cardiovascular health indicators were performed and general practitioners received periodic (annual, biannual or monthly) feedback about their clinical practice. We evaluated improvement in screening, diagnosis and control of the main CRFs and the effects of the feedback on cardiovascular risk (CR), incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality, comparing baseline data with data at the end of the study (after a 10-year follow-up). The impact of the intervention was assessed globally and with respect to feedback frequency. General improvement was observed in screening, percentage of diagnoses and control of CRFs. At the end of the study, few clinically significant differences in CRFs were observed between groups.

The comparative outcomes of the 2 surgeries is a topic of ongoing debate and medium-term outcomes remain uncertain.A search for RCTs comparing LRYGB versus LSG was conducted. Pooled outcomes between 2 procedures were compared using pairwise random-effects meta-analysis at 1, 3, and 5-year follow-up time points. Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation was used to assess certainty of evidence.Thirty-three studies involving 2475 patients were included.

Multivariable logistic regression model was used to compare the non-adherence (proportion of days covered [PDC]<0.80) rates whereas Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to compare switching and non-persistence (≥90-day gap) among different DPP4-is over 12-months.Overall, 36.0% (5722/15,915) of DPP-4i users were non-adherent and 30.0% (4775/15,915) were non-persistent at 12-months. Compared to sitagliptin, vildagliptin, linagliptin, and alogliptin were not associated with higher non-adherence and non-persistence. However, saxagliptin was associated with a higher likelihood of being non-adherent (odds ratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-1.60) or non-persistent (hazard ratio 1.27, 95% CI 1.15-1.42) compared to sitagliptin.

This observed pleomorphic effect in physiology can be barely explained by interaction with only one target protein such as the trace-amine receptor 1 (TAAR1), a class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). Moreover,  knock-out mice still react to 3-T1AM through physiological responses with a rapid decrease in body temperature. These facts propelled our group and others to search for further targets for this molecule.The group of TAARs evolved early in evolution and, according to sequence similarities, they are closely related to adrenoceptors and other aminergic receptors. Therefore, several of these receptors were characterized by their potential to interplay with 3-T1AM. Indeed, 3-T1AM acts as a positive allosteric modulator on the beta2-adrenoceptor (ADRB2) and as a biased agonist on the serotonin receptor 1B (5HT1b) and the alpha2-adrenoceptor (ADRA2A). In addition, 3-T1AM was reported to be a weak antagonist at a non-aminergic muscarinic receptor (M3).These findings impressively reflect that such trace amines can unselectively and simultaneously function at different receptors expressed by one cell or at different tissues. In conclusion, the role of 3-T1AM is hypothesized to concert the fine-tuning of specific cell reactions by the accentuation of certain pathways dependent on distinct receptors. 3-T1AM acts as a regulator of signals by blocking, modulating, or inducing simultaneously distinct intracellular signaling cascades via different GPCRs.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696865>Increased Levels of Glycated Hemoglobin A1c and Iron Deficiency Anemia: A Review.</a></h2><p>Worldwide, the prevalence of  remains high.

Our aim is to provide an estimate of the prevalence of severe NAFLD in T2DM and identify its major predictors.T2DM patients (=328) not previously known to have NAFLD underwent clinical assessment, transient elastography with measure of liver stiffness (LS) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), and genotyping for patatin like phospholipase domain containing 3 () and 17β-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type 13 ().Median LS was 6.1 kPa (4.9 to 8.6). More than one-fourth patients had advanced liver disease, defined as LS ≥7.9 kPa (=94/238, 29%), and had a higher body mass index (BMI) than those with a LS <7.9 kPa. Carriage of the G allele in the PNPLA3 gene was associated with higher LS, being 5.9 kPa (4.7 to 7.7) in C/C homozygotes, 6.1 kPa (5.2 to 8.7) in C/G heterozygotes, and 6.8 kPa (5.8 to 9.2) in G/G homozygotes (=0.01). This trend was absent in patients with ≥1 mutated  allele. In a multiple linear regression model, BMI and  genotype predicted LS, while age, gender, disease duration, and glycosylated hemoglobin did not fit into the model. None of these variables was confirmed to be predictive among carriers of at least one  mutated allele. There was no association between CAP and polymorphisms of  or .Advanced NAFLD is common among T2DM patients.

The aim of this study was to look at the prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) organisms in patients admitted with urosepsis and their effect on the treatment and outcome of patients in our hospital.A total of 2679 urine cultures and 654 blood cultures performed in Connolly Hospital Emergency Department were reviewed between 2016 and 2018. Patients were included if they had a matching urine culture and blood culture performed within 24 h of admission. We compared patient demographics and underlying co-morbidities between patients admitted with urosepsis secondary to MDR organisms and non-MDR organisms.Our study included 85 patients admitted with urosepsis. The most common causative pathogen was Escherichia coli, and 34.1% (n = 29) of pathogens were classified as an MDR organism. Patients admitted with urosepsis from long-term care facilities were 2.3 times more likely to have urosepsis due to a MDR organism compared with patients admitted from the community. Patients admitted with urosepsis secondary to a MDR organism were also more likely to have co-morbidities such as  and dementia.The high rate of antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted with urosepsis poses a challenge in prescribing the most appropriate antibiotics.

However, renal outcomes such as end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in patients with HSK remain unclear.In total, 146 patients with HSK (age of ≥20 years) from two tertiary hospitals were included in this study. Control individuals who underwent medical check-ups were selected by matching for age, sex, serum creatinine level, hypertension and . The hazard ratios (HRs) for the risks of ESRD and all-cause mortality were calculated after adjustment for multiple variables.The proportions of HSK-related complications for obstruction, kidney stones, urinary tract infection and urogenital cancer were 26, 25, 19 and 4%, respectively. During the median follow-up period of 9 years (maximum 32 years), the incidence of ESRD was 2.6/10 000 person-years. The risk of ESRD in patients with HSK was higher than in control individuals [adjusted HR = 7.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-50.47]. All-cause mortality did not differ between the two groups (adjusted HR = 0.6; 95% CI 0.08-4.29).Patients with HSK are at risk of ESRD, which may be attributable to the high prevalence of complications. Accordingly, these patients should be regarded as having chronic kidney disease and require regular monitoring of both kidney function and potential complications.© The Author(s) 2019.

We intended to analyze a new recently presented fasting index, SPISE (sensitivity formula: 600 × HDL-cholesterol/triglycerides/BMI), in comparison with three previously known fasting indexes, regarding correlation with the insulin clamp index, and for the predictive effects of future long-term risks of coronary heart disease (CHD) or manifest type 2 . A total of 1049 71-year-old male subjects from the Swedish ULSAM study, median follow-up 8 years, were included. All subjects performed the euglycemic insulin clamp, and analyses of four fasting insulin resistance indexes: SPISE-IR (= 10/SPISE), QUICKI-IR, Log HOMA-IR, and Revised QUICKI-IR. Spearman correlation coefficients with the insulin clamp were 0.60-0.62 for all indexes. Area under curve at ROC analysis was 0.80 for SPISE-IR, and 0.84 for QUICKI-IR, Log HOMA-IR, and Rev QUICKI-IR. Adjusted hazard ratios per 1 SD index increase for long-term risk CHD were similar in all patients: 1.20-1.24 ( = 0.02-0.03). However, comparing the highest quartile (recommended to define insulin resistance) with the lower quartiles, SPISE-IR was the strongest and the only statistically significant insulin resistance index: HR 1.53 ( = 0.02). Adjusted odds ratios per 1 SD index increase for long-term risk of type 2  were fairly similar ( < 0.001) in all patients: 1.62 for SPISE-IR, 1.97 for QUICKI-IR and Log HOMA-IR, and 2.04 for Rev QUICKI-IR, and also when comparing the highest versus the lower quartiles: 2.8-3.1 ( < 0.001).

Weighted polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for T1D, T2D and  endophenotypes were tested for association with CFRD.Genome-wide significance was obtained for variants at a novel locus (PTMA) and two known CFRD genetic modifiers (TCF7L2 and SLC26A9). PTMA and SLC26A9 variants were CF-specific; TCF7L2 variants also associated with T2D. CFRD was strongly associated with PRSs for T2D, insulin secretion, post-challenge glucose concentration and fasting plasma glucose, and less strongly with T1D PRSs. CFRD was inconsistently associated with PRSs for insulin sensitivity and was not associated with a PRS for islet autoimmunity. A CFRD PRS comprised of variants selected from these PRSs (with FDR p-value<0.1) and the genome-wide significant variants was associated with CFRD in a replication population.CFRD and T2D have more etiologic and mechanistic overlap than previously known, aligning along pathways involving β-cell function rather than insulin sensitivity. Two CFRD risk loci are unrelated to T2D and may affect multiple aspects of CF. An 18-variant PRS stratifies risk of CFRD in an independent population.© Endocrine Society 2019. All rights reserved.

The first day served for adaptation, the second and third one for determining study data during 9 night hours with or without growth hormone. Abdominal subcutaneous microdialysate and blood were continuously collected and forwarded to a separate room next door where hourly taken samples were centrifuged and frozen until analysed.Growth hormone achieved the peak serum level after 3 h followed by a plateau-like course for the next 6 h. Glycerol in microdialysate started to rise 2 h following growth hormone injection achieving significance compared to placebo after 9 h (<0.05). Serum glycerol increased 4 h after growth hormone administration achieving significance after 6 h (<0.05). Glucose and amino acid concentrations showed neither in microdialysate nor in serum significant differences between growth hormone and placebo. Serum values of insulin and C-peptide revealed no significant difference between growth hormone and placebo.As the result of a high single subcutaneous dose of GH, persistent lipolysis can be shown in continuously collected microdialysate and blood, but no indication for gluconeogenesis or protein anabolism.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697993>Serum calcification propensity in type 1  associates with mineral stress.</a></h2><p>Increased vascular calcification could be an underlying mechanism of cardiovascular complications in type 1  (T1DM). Calcificationpropensitycan be monitored by the maturation time of calciprotein particles in serum (T test). A high calcification propensity (i.e. low T-value) is an independent determinant of mortality in various populations. Aim was to investigate Tlevels with indices of calcium metabolism and disease status in T1DM patients.As part of a prospective cohort study, T1DM patients were examined annually. At baseline T was determined in 216 (77%) patients (57% male) with a mean age of 45 (12) years,  duration 22 [15.8, 30.4] years and HbA1c of 60 (12) mmol/mol (7.6 (1.0) %). Baseline data were collected in 2002 and follow-up data were collected in 2018.The T time was normally distributed with a mean of 339 (60) minutes. Patients in the highest tertile of T (range 369 to 466) were older, had lower phosphate and PTH and higher magnesium and vitamin D concentrations as compared to the middle (range 317 to 368) and lowest (range 129 to 316) tertiles, while eGFR was comparable between groups. During follow-up of 15 years, 43 patients developed a macrovascular complication and 26 patients died. In regression analysis, T was not a prognostic factor for the development of complications or mortality.The T time was associated with indices of increased mineral stress, but not with the development of long-term macrovascular complications.Copyright © 2019.

The clinical relevance of the aforementioned criteria remains unclear. The present study aimed to determine factors influencing postural blood pressure changes and their relationship with physical, functional and cognitive performance in older adults.Individuals aged ≥ 55 years were recruited through the Malaysian Elders Longitudinal Research (MELoR) study and continuous non-invasive BP was monitored over 5 min of supine rest and 3 min of standing. Physical performance was measured using the timed-up-and-go test, functional reach, handgrip and Lawton's functional ability scale. Cognition was measured with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Participants were categorized according to BP responses into four categories according to changes in SBP/DBP reductions from supine to standing: < 20/10 mmHg within 3 min (no OH), ≥ 20/10 mmHg from 15 s to 3 min (COH), ≥ 40/20 mmHg within 15 s and ≥ 20/10 mmHg from 15 s to 3 min (COH + IOH) and ≥ 40/20 mmHg within 15 s and < 20/10 mmHg within 3 min (IOH).A total of 1245 participants were recruited, COH + IOH 623 (50%), IOH 165 (13%) and COH 145 (12%). Differences between groups existed in age, gender, hypertension, , use of alpha-blocker and/or beta-blocker, ACE-inhibitors, diuretics, biguanides, and baseline systolic BP. In univariate analyses, differences between groups were present in physical performance and cognition. Multivariate comparisons revealed better physical performance in IOH compared to no OH, better physical and cognitive performance in COH + IOH compared to no OH, and cognition in COH than no OH.Our findings suggest that older adults who fulfil current consensus definitions for IOH had better physical performance and cognitive scores. This indicates that an initial postural BP drop in people aged ≥ 55 years may not necessarily be associated with increased frailty, as suggested by previously published literature.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693539>Diabetic polyneuropathy and pain, prevalence, and patient characteristics: a cross-sectional questionnaire study of 5,514 patients with recently diagnosed type 2 .</a></h2><p>Most studies of diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) and painful DPN are conducted in persons with longstanding . This cross-sectional study aimed to estimate the prevalence of DPN and painful DPN, important risk factors, and the association with mental health in recently diagnosed type 2 .

For people with developmental disabilities, the most prominent facilitator of self-care behaviors was the support they received for the behaviors. For people with visual impairments, that facilitator was the use of helpful assistive devices that take advantage of another sense. The main barriers to self-care behaviors were mobility limitation for people with physical disabilities and lack of accessibility for people with visual impairments.This review has identified barriers to and facilitators of  self-care behaviors by type of disability.

We examined the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-assessed lipoprotein subclass profiles in subjects with T1DM compared with those of healthy subjects and assessed the potential relationship of these profiles with arterial stiffness.Eighty-four participants with T1DM of at least 10 years duration and no clinical cardiovascular disease (age: 35-65 years; 50% men) and 42 healthy participants were evaluated for: (1) clinical and anthropometric data (including classical cardiovascular risk factors), (2) insulin sensitivity by estimated glucose disposal rate, (3) microvascular complications, (4) NMR-assessed lipoprotein subclass profile, and (5) arterial stiffness (aortic pulse wave velocity).Participants with T1DM had an apparently better conventional lipid profile than healthy participants, but with significant differences in NMR-assessed lipoprotein profiles such as higher triglyceride content of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). In healthy participants, arterial stiffness was associated with NMR-based LDL subclasses. By contrast, in T1DM participants, arterial stiffness was independently associated mainly with NMR-based very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) subclasses: positively with total VLDL particles (and subclasses) and VLDL triglyceride content, and negatively with LDL and HDL particle sizes. These results were maintained after adjustments for classical cardiovascular risk factors.Subjects with T1DM, while having an apparently better conventional lipid profile than healthy controls, presented significant alterations in their NMR-assessed lipoprotein profile. The association between arterial stiffness and NMR-assessed lipoprotein profiles also differed in both groups.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of OSAS in Senegalese dialysis patients. In a cross-sectional study including 128 patients (75 men and 53 women) dialyzed since ≥6 months in four dialysis units. Data were collected during the dialysis session in the units. OSAS was assessed with the Berlin Questionnaire. Factors associated with OSAS risk were identified by multivariate logistic regression. The mean age of patients was 46.8 ± 16.9 ¥16-85 years). OSAS was found in 53 patients (overall prevalence of 41.4%) with predominance among individuals aged ≥50 years (52.6%). Hypertension and  were more frequent in patients with OSAS, while the prevalence of obesity and sedentary was not different.

Interview data were collected from July to August 2015. An interview guide was developed to explore health center teams' initial experiences with  group visit implementation. Interviews were conducted with 14 individuals who participated in a training prior to  group visit implementation. Four levels of coding (open, in vivo, categorical, and thematic) were used to identify characteristics of group visit implementation in 5 CHCs. A semi-structured model encouraged interprofessional teamwork across all CHC teams. Self-appointed or chosen team champions were the "pulse" or central driving force of implementation. A designated time in the clinic for patients to receive education and psychosocial support enhanced engagement in  self-management. Early buy-in from upper leadership was critical to securing fiscal and human resources as unexpected needs emerged during group visit implementation. Time commitment of clinic staff and providers for ongoing operations, socioeconomic challenges of patients, staff turnover, and billing were reported as challenges in the initial implementation process.

We defined 'brief' as a protocol lasting ≤15 min including warm-up, cool-down, and recovery, and involving a total of ≤5 min of 'vigorous' exercise, which was classified as meeting or exceeding the lower end of the range for this relative intensity per criteria from the American College of Sports Medicine. The physiological mechanisms responsible for the increase in CRF, as measured by maximal oxygen update (VO ), after brief vigorous exercise are unclear, and likely depend on various factors including the specific nature of the intervention as well as the time course of the response. Limited available evidence suggests the potential for an increased oxygen extraction by active muscle (i.e. greater arterio-venous oxygen difference), since an increase in VO has been reported after several weeks of brief vigorous exercise despite no measurable change in cardiac output. Emerging evidence indicates that brief vigorous exercise can improve glycemic control, suggesting that this type of exercise could potentially play a role in the prevention and management of type 2 . The acute response is not well characterized but several studies have shown that several weeks brief vigorous exercise improves estimates of insulin sensitivity as determined by various methods including by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. The physiological mechanisms underlying improved CRF and glycemic control after brief vigorous exercise, and broader impact on health, remain fruitful areas of investigation.

Smoking cigarettes increases the risk of developing type II  and intensifies pathophysiological processes during the development of type I . Tobacco smoke is also additional source of free radicals. Moreover, smoking causes variety of adverse effects on organs, that have no direct contact with the tobacco smoke itself. The objective of the study was to examine the effects of tobacco smoke on the serum concentrations of relevant oxidative stress markers such as total protein (TP), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), as well as renal (creatinine, urea) and liver function (alkaline phosphatase, ALP; alanine aminotransferase, ALT; aspartate aminotransferase, AST) among animals with induced  after administration of a single dose of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg, ip).The markers of oxidative stress and biochemical parameters were determined using spectrophotometric methods. As a biomarker of exposure to tobacco smoke, cotinine was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD).Tobacco smoke exposure of diabetic rats was manifested by significantly elevated liver enzymes activity - ALT (p < 0.05) and ALP (p < 0.01), higher creatinine and urea concentration (p < 0.01), lower GSH amount (p < 0.05), and higher GST activity (p < 0.05).Tobacco smoking induce liver and renal damage through the mechanisms including increased oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

Thirty-day readmission and LOS were considered indicators of the quality of care, with the understanding that the potential significant effects of these outcomes could be varied.This scoping review followed the methodology described by Arksey and O'Malley.Five databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and CINAHL were searched, and a total of 20 articles involving 913807 patients were included. Results were reported in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines.The results indicated that patients with both ACS and T2DM have prolonged LOS and increased 30-day readmission rates. The findings supported that improvements in patient self-management behavior for optimal health outcomes was partially successful by effective self-management programs; however, few articles on intervention programs specifically designed for patients with two conditions were found.Prolonged LOS and increased 30-day readmission rates are found among patients with ACS and T2DM.

Metformin, a first-line antidiabetic drug, functions mainly by improving patients' hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. However, its mechanism of action is still not well understood. We show here that pharmacological metformin concentration increases mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, and ATP levels in hepatocytes and a clinically relevant metformin dose increases liver mitochondrial density and complex 1 activity along with improved hyperglycemia in high-fat- diet (HFD)-fed mice. Metformin, functioning through 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), promotes mitochondrial fission to improve mitochondrial respiration and restore the mitochondrial life cycle. Furthermore, HFD-fed-mice with liver-specific knockout of AMPKα1/2 subunits exhibit higher blood glucose levels when treated with metformin. Our results demonstrate that activation of AMPK by metformin improves mitochondrial respiration and hyperglycemia in obesity. We also found that supra-pharmacological metformin concentrations reduce adenine nucleotides, resulting in the halt of mitochondrial respiration. These findings suggest a mechanism for metformin's anti-tumor effects.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Thus, chronic exposure to environmental chemicals that affect mitochondrial function can have harmful effects on humans. We argue that the concept of hormesis should be revisited to explain the non-linear responses to mitochondrial toxins at a low-dose range and develop practical methods to protect humans from the negative effects of mitochondrial toxins. Of the most concern to humans are lipophilic chemical mixtures and heavy metals, owing to their physical properties. Even though these chemicals tend to demonstrate no safe level in humans, a non-linear dose-response has been also observed. Stress response activation, i.e., hormesis, can explain this non-linearity. Recently, hormesis has reemerged as a unifying concept because diverse stressors can induce similar stress responses. Besides potentially harmful environmental chemicals, healthy lifestyle interventions such as exercise, calorie restriction (especially glucose), cognitive stimulation, and phytochemical intake also activate stress responses. This conceptual link can lead to the development of practical methods that counterbalance the harm of mitochondrial toxins. Unlike chemical hormesis with its safety issues, the activation of stress responses via lifestyle modification can be safely used to combat the negative effects of mitochondrial toxins.Copyright © 2019 Korean  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693702>Emerging practices supporting  self-management among food insecure adults and families: A scoping review.</a></h2><p>Food insecurity undermines a patient's ability to follow  self-management recommendations.

Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred access for hemodialysis (HD). Referral to nephrology of CKD patients starting HD in Jordan and its impact on AVF utilization is unknown. Patients on in-center HD in a large Jordan Ministry of Health dialysis unit were interviewed, and medical records reviewed to assess prior nephrology care and AVF use. Of 104 total patients, 93 met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 50 ± 16 years, with 44% being females. The average body mass index was 25 ± 5. The cause of ESRD was  in 28 (30%), hypertension in 28 (30%), and polycystic kidney disease in three (3%). Type of HD access at the initiation of dialysis was central venous catheter (CVC) in 80 (86%) and AVF in 12 (13%). Of the overall group, 50 (54%) were seen by nephrology before initiating dialysis, and of these, 39 patients (78%) were seen >1 year before HD initiation. Of the patients who initiated dialysis with a CVC, 38 (48%) had received prior nephrology care. All 12 patients who initiated dialysis with AVF had received prior nephrology care. Of the 50 patients who received nephrology care before dialysis initiation, 12 patients (24%) had started dialysis with an AVF; in patients without prior nephrology care, all were started with a CVC. In conclusion, our study suggests that a large percentage did not have nephrology care before initiating dialysis.

The thermogenic response of brown adipocytes to thyroid hormones is resulting from the synergistic interaction of thyroid hormones with the sympathetic nervous system. In recent years, evidence has been provided that thyroid hormones also induce the browning of white adipose tissues.

After informed consent, 305 patients (143 females), including 255 patients with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and 30 with Turner syndrome (TS), from eight investigational sites, were enrolled in Greece. Demographic data, treatment efficacy, and adverse events were reported at the discretion of attending physicians.Treatment with GH was undertaken for 247/255 patients with GHD and 29/30 with TS. The majority of patients treated with GHD (73.7%) and TS (84%) with recorded Tanner stage were prepubertal at enrolment. Among patients treated with GHD and TS, 70.45% and 55% were GH-naïve at study entry, respectively. Height standard deviation score (SDS), height velocity SDS, and height SDS-target height SDS numerically improved during the 4-year observation period. The effect of GH treatment was more prominent in the first year of treatment, especially in the GHD group.In the Greek cohort of GeNeSIS, GHD is the most frequent indication for GH treatment, followed by TS. While the latter is diagnosed somewhat earlier, GH treatment is not as efficacious as for patients with GHD. No major safety issues were reported during follow-up.

Federal funding agencies have made continuation of funding of clinical trials contingent on meeting recruitment targets. It is incumbent on investigators to carefully set study recruitment timelines and resource needs to meet those goals as required under current funding mechanisms. This paper highlights the cost, labor, and barriers to recruitment for Program ACTVE II, a successful multisite randomized controlled trial of behavioral treatments for depression in adults with type 2 , conducted in rural and urban settings in three states.Quantitative and qualitative data on recruitment were gathered from study staff throughout the study recruitment period and were used to calculate costs and effort. The study utilized two main approaches to recruitment: (1) relying on potential participants to see ads in the community and call a toll-free number; and (2) direct phone calls to potential participants by study staff.Contact was attempted with 18,925 people to obtain the enrolled sample of 140. The cost of recruitment activities during the 4.5-year recruitment period totaled $190,056, an average cost of $1358 per enrolled participant. Qualitative evaluations identified multiple barriers to recruitment.Recruitment for Program ACTIVE II exemplifies the magnitude of resources needed to reach recruitment targets in the current era. Continuous evaluation, flexibility, and adaptation are required on the part of investigators, community partners, and funding agencies to successfully reach high-risk populations in rural and urban areas.ClinicalTrials.gov,  .

Recently, energy metabolism in adipose tissue has been the subject of renewed interest, because significant energy expenditure can be induced in cells derived from white adipose tissue progenitors, in addition to brown adipose tissue (BAT). Here we evaluated whether aging-associated change in various adipose tissue depots affects the progression of NAFLD.Six-week-old male C57BL/6NCrSlc mice were fed control chow (C) or high-fat diet (60% fat; HF) for 12 or 24 weeks (12w/C, 12w/HF, 24w/C and 24w/HF groups, respectively) or switched from C to HF diet at 18 weeks of age (24w/C/HF group) and fed for a further 24 weeks. Some 24w/HF mice received a subcutaneous transplantation of adipose progenitors (10 cells/mouse) from young donor mice. Basal energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, and liver and adipose tissue histology were then evaluated. In addition, features of senescence and the capacity of adipose progenitors to "brown" were compared in mice of various ages.12w/HF mice demonstrated compensation in the forms of hypertrophy of interscapular classical BAT and the appearance of subcutaneous beige adipocytes, consistent with improved metabolic homeostasis. In contrast, 24w/HF and 24w/C/HF mice developed obesity, glucose intolerance, and severe NAFLD, with accelerated senescence and loss of adipose progenitors in subcutaneous fat tissues. Recruitment of adipose progenitors ameliorated these findings in 24w/HF mice.Impaired metabolic compensation in adipose tissue resulted in the progression of NAFLD, which was associated with aging-related deterioration in adipose progenitors. A new approach targeting adipose tissue progenitors might represent a potential strategy for the prevention of NAFLD.© 2019 Taketani et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691513>Predictive model to identify the risk of losing protective sensibility of the foot in patients with .</a></h2><p>Diabetic neuropathy is defined as the presence of symptoms and signs of peripheral nerve dysfunction in diabetics.

Recent studies demonstrated that T2DM compromises bone fracture healing in which miR-222 might be involved. Furthermore, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP-3) that is the target of miR-222 accelerates fracture healing. Therefore, we assume that miR-222 could inhibit TIMP-3 expression. Eight-week-old rats were operated femoral fracture or sham, following the injection of streptozotocin (STZ) to induce  one week later in fractured rats, and then, new generated tissues were collected for measuring the expression of miR-222 and TIMP-3. Rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated and treated with miR-222 mimic or inhibitor to analyse osteogenic differentiation. MiR-222 was increased in fractured rats and further induced in diabetic rats. In contrast, TIMP-3 was reduced in fractured and further down-regulated in diabetic rats. Luciferase report assay indicated miR-222 directly binds and mediated TIMP-3. Furthermore, osteogenic differentiation was suppressed by miR-222 mimic and promoted by miR-222 inhibitor. miR-222 is a key regulator that is promoted in STZ-induced diabetic rats, and it binds to TIMP3 to reduce TIMP-3 expression and suppressed MSCs' differentiation.© 2019 The Authors.

Glucotoxicity most likely corresponds to the vascular intricacy and metabolic alterations, such as increased oxidation of free fatty acids and reduced glucose oxidation. More than half of those with  also develop cardiac abnormalities due to unknown causes, posing a major threat to the currently available marketed preparations which are being used for treating these cardiac complications. Even though impairment in cardiac functioning is the principal cause of death in individuals with type 2  (T2D), reducing plasma glucose levels has little effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that inhibitors of sodium glucose transporter (SGLT) represent a putative therapeutic intervention for these pathological conditions. Several clinical trials have reported the efficacy of SGLT inhibitors as a novel and potent anti-diabetic agent which along with its anti-hyperglycaemic activity possesses the potential of effectively treating its associated cardiac abnormalities.

These mice are known for having extended lifespan, healthspan and female reproductive longevity. Seventeen α-estradiol (17α-E2) is reported to increase insulin sensitivity and extend lifespan in male mice, with less robust effects in female mice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ovarian reserve in wild type and GHRKO mice treated with 17α-E2. The mice were divided into four groups, GHRKO mice receiving a standard chow diet, GHRKO mice treated 17α-E2, wild type mice receiving a standard chow diet and WT mice treated with 17α-E2. 17α-E2 was provided in the diet for four months. IGF1 plasma concentrations and changes in body weight were assessed. Histological slides were prepared from the ovaries and the number of follicles was counted. GHRKO mice receiving the control diet had a greater number of primordial follicles and lower numbers of primary follicles compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). 17α-E2 treatment decreased the number of primordial follicles in GHRKO mice (p < 0.05), however had no effect in wild type mice. Treatment with 17α-E2 had no significant effect on the change in body weight during the experiment (p = 0.75). Plasma IGF1 concentrations were significantly lower in GHRKO mice as compared to wild type. In conclusion, we found that GHRKO mice displayed lesser primordial follicle activation as compared to wild type mice, but this phenotype was reversed by 17α-E2 administration, suggesting that ovarian aging is increased by 17α-E2 in long-living mice with extended reproductive longevity.Copyright © 2018.

Seventy-two participants received CoMac's linguistically tailored patient-centric communication; a control group of 48 did not receive this intervention. In Phase II, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels from the first visit to the follow-up visit for each group were compared.Interviews conducted during Phase I suggested that the system can be successfully implemented into DSMES practice. Knowing individual psychosocial profiles and participants' language use allowed for more effective patient counseling. In Phase II, multiple regression analysis with HbA1c change as the dependent variable showed that the key variable of interest, treated with the CoMac intervention, had a one-tailed -value of -1.81, with a statistically significant probability value of 0.037.Findings suggest that use of the CoMac System by  care professionals has the potential for improved patient health outcomes. Patients receiving the CoMac intervention showed significantly improved HbA1c levels, suggesting that this approach has great promise for effective DSMES management.© 2019 Connor et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695589>Hyperuricemia and its Association with Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in Type Two  Patients at the University of Gondar Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia.</a></h2><p>Hyperuricemia is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) that presents in  patients.

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the role that total flavonoids of Epimedium (TFE) played against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic testicular dysfunction and to elucidate the mechanism of action. The diabetic rat model was induced by vein injection of STZ in healthy rats. Thirty male healthy Spraque-Dawley rats were randomly divided into following groups: the control group, the diabetic group, and the diabetic + TFE group. Gastrointestinal administration begins at fifth week of TFE for 6 weeks. After TFE administration, all animals were euthanized. Testicular tissue samples and blood samples of rats were collected for histopathological examination and for determination of levels of various biomarkers including blood glucose, testosterone, testicular enzymes, and oxidative stress indicators. All testes were weighted to calculate the testicular organ index. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used for observing the testis and epididymis pathological changes. Protein expression (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, transforming growth factor-beta-1, interleukin-6, and 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) was detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot techniques. There was a significant difference in the changes between the  group and the control group. As a result of treat with TFE, the blood glucose decreased but there was no significant difference, and other indicators showed significant improvement.

They thereby fine-regulate local thyroid hormone concentrations in organs or cells. The chemical reaction is unique in the sense that in metazoans the reductive elimination of iodide depends on the rare amino acid selenocysteine in the enzymes' active centers. While there is no prokaryotic homologue of such deiodinases, the solution of the crystal structure of a catalytic domain of mouse deiodinase 3 has revealed that the ancient peroxiredoxin structure has been repurposed, and improved using selenocysteine, as a deiodinase during metazoan evolution. Likewise, many biochemical findings obtained over decades can now be interpreted in light of the molecular structure. Despite this leap in our understanding of deiodinase structure, there are still several open questions that need to be addressed in order to fully understand substrate binding, catalytic mechanism, and regulation of deiodinases.

Enrollees with behavioral conditions were more likely to encounter OON clinicians in inpatient and outpatient settings. For instance, those with drug use disorders were 12.9 percentage points (95% CI, 12.5-13.2 percentage points; P < .001) more likely to have inpatient OON care than those with CHF and 15.3 percentage points (95% CI, 15.1-15.6 percentage points; P < .001) more likely to receive outpatient OON care. Behavioral conditions also had higher cost sharing for OON care. For example, individuals with mental health conditions had cost-sharing payments for OON care $341 (95% CI, $331-$351) higher than those with  (P < .001), individuals with drug use disorders had cost-sharing payments for OON care $1242 (95% CI, $1209-$1276) higher than those with  (P < .001), and individuals with alcohol use disorders had cost-sharing payments for OON care $1138 (95% CI, $1101-$1174) higher than those with  (P < .001). The OON care rates and cost-sharing payments were much higher when enrollees sought care from behavioral clinicians and facilities.In this cross-sectional study of enrollees in commercial insurance plans, cost sharing for OON care among those with behavioral health conditions was significantly higher than those with chronic physical conditions. These disparities may be indicative of limited in-network availability for behavioral health care.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694103>[Correlation between serum bilirubin and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in patients with type 2 ].</a></h2><p> To investigate the correlation between serum bilirubin and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) in type 2  patients.  A total of 369 patients with type 2  who were hospitalized at the Department of Endocrinology, Nanjing Jinling Hospital from April 2017 to October 2018 were enrolled, including 226 males and 143 females, with an average age of (54.6±12.1) years. According to cardiovascular reflex tests (CARTs), all the patients were divided into Non CAN group(149 patients without CAN) and CAN group (220 patients complicated with CAN). The difference of serum bilirubin levels between the two groups was compared. The differences of CARTs and the incidence of CAN were compared by tertiles of serum bilirubin levels. The binary logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors for diabetic cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy.  The serum total bilirubin [(9.28±2.74) μmol/L vs (11.08±2.98) μmol/L, 0.001], direct bilirubin [(3.17±1.20) μmol/L vs (3.71±1.24) μmol/L, 0.001] and indirect bilirubin levels [(6.11±1.89) μmol/L vs (7.37±2.10) μmol/L, 0.001] in CAN group were significantly lower than that in Non CAN group. With the increase of serum bilirubin, the incidence of CAN decreased (0.01). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that serum total bilirubin (0.819, 95: 0.744-0.901, 0.001), direct bilirubin (0.739, 95: 0.601-0.908, 0.004) and indirect bilirubin (0.749, 95: 0.653-0.860, 0.001) were inversely correlated with the incidence of CAN.  Within the physiological range, lower level of serum bilirubin is inversely correlated with the incidence of CAN. It is noteworthy to screen diabetic cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in patients with type 2  who had a lower serum bilirubin level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693491>Measurement accuracy of two professional-use systems for point-of-care testing of blood glucose.</a></h2><p>Background The professional-use systems HemoCue® Glucose 201+ (HC201+) and HemoCue® Glucose 201 RT (HC201RT) are widely used for point-of-care testing (POCT) of blood glucose (BG). HC201RT utilizes unit-use microcuvettes which can be stored at room temperature, whereas HC201+ microcuvettes have to be stored at <8 °C. In this study, system accuracy of HC201+ and HC201RT was evaluated using capillary and venous blood samples. Methods For each system, two reagent system lots were evaluated within a period of 2 years based on testing procedures of ISO 15197:2013, a standard applicable for self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) systems. For each reagent system lot, the investigation was performed by using 100 capillary and 95 to 99 venous blood samples. Comparison measurements were performed with a hexokinase laboratory method. Accuracy criteria of ISO 15197:2013 and POCT12-A3 were applied. In addition, bias was analyzed according to Bland and Altman, and error grid analysis was performed. Results When measuring capillary samples, both systems fulfilled accuracy requirements of ISO 15197:2013 and POCT12-A3 with the investigated reagent system lots. When measuring venous samples, only HC201+ fulfilled these requirements. Bias between HC201+ and reference measurements was more consistent over venous and capillary samples and microcuvette lots than for HC201RT. Error grid analysis showed that clinical actions might have been different depending on which system was used. Conclusions In this study, HC201+ showed a high level of accuracy irrespective of the sample type (capillary or venous). In contrast, HC201RT measurement results were markedly affected by the type of sample.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696503>Resveratrol ameliorates high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance and fatty acid oxidation via ATM-AMPK axis in skeletal muscle.</a></h2><p>Resveratrol (RSV) is a polyphenolic phytoalexin that exhibits diverse pharmacological actions, including its effect on the insulin resistance. However, the mechanism through which RSV improves insulin resistance is not fully understood yet. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism through which RSV ameliorates insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mouse model, as well as palmitic acid (PA) treated L6 cells, with a specific focus on the response of RSV on fatty acid oxidation.Male C57BL6/J mice were randomly divided into three groups: normal diet-fed mice (ND), the high-fat diet-fed mice (HFD), HFD supplemented with RSV (100 mg/kg body weight [BW]/day orally; n = 10). Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and free fatty acid levels were determined. The intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was used to measure blood glucose and area under the curve. The quantitative insulin sensitivity index was calculated to assess insulin resistance. Skeletal muscles were collected for histology study and protein expression measurement. L6 cells were cultured with PA and the glucose concentration in the culture medium, and the intracellular TG levels were tested. RSV, chloroquine, palmitoyltransferase and Ku-55933 were administered to differentiate L6 cells.The HFD fed mice showed increased BW, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia. The expressions of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, cytochrome oxidase subunit IV protein were significantly decreased in the skeletal muscles of HFD fed mice and PA-treated L6 cells. All these effects induced by HFD and PA were reversed by RSV treatment.ATM is a key factor to improve HFD-induced lipid metabolism and insulin resistance in skeletal muscles. The effects of RSV on ameliorating HFD-induced abnormal lipid metabolism and insulin resistance mediated through ATM-AMPK pathway may due to its improvement in fatty acid oxidation efficiency and sequential reduction in ROS production in skeletal muscle. These results provide important theoretical evidence for the application of RSV in the prevention and treatment of  and related metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697147>Introduction to the special section on school-related outcomes and success for youth with chronic medical conditions.</a></h2><p>Chronic medical conditions permeate our schools with estimates showing that between 15% and 25% of students present with an ongoing illness or disease. Treatments for the most prevalent of these conditions (e.g., , epilepsy, cancer, juvenile arthritis, and asthma) include hospitalizations, home treatments, and frequent physician appointments-all of which are highly disruptive to children and families. Given the potential medical, cognitive/academic, social-emotional, and behavioral challenges encountered by students with chronic medical conditions, school psychologists are in a unique position to both identify and support the educational experiences of these students. Further, schools provide an ideal forum for outcomes research and intervention programs. This Introduction to the Special Issue on School-Related Outcomes and Success for Youth With Chronic Medical Conditions addresses definitional issues, identifies challenges, reviews the 7 empirical articles in this issue, and discusses areas for future research. This special issue includes scientifically rigorous papers, which feature innovative studies that emphasize real-time, momentary assessments; positive psychology frameworks; and intervention approaches.

This diabesity epidemic is increasingly impacting children and adolescents, and there is scarce evidence of interventions with favourable long-term outcomes.In order to understand the determinants of diabesity and how to address them, multiple stakeholders were invited to a meeting to discuss current state of knowledge and to help design a program to prevent pediatric and adolescent diabesity.The meeting was held at McMaster University on March 4th, 2015. The event involved presentations to deliver state-of-the-art knowledge about diabesity, and roundtable discussions of several domains including nutrition, physical activity, sleep, and mental health. Discussion transcripts were analyzed using NVivo.Forty-nine participants took part in the workshop. They included clinical healthcare professionals, public health, Aboriginal Patient Navigator, research scientists, students, and patients with family members. A total of 628 reference counts from the roundtable discussions were coded under 20 emerging themes. Participants believed that the most important elements of the program involve the provision of knowledge and education, family involvement, patient motivation, location of program delivery, and use of surveys and questionnaires for outcome measurement.Effective pediatric and adolescent diabesity prevention programs should be conceptualized by multidisciplinary stakeholders and embrace the complexity of diabesity with multiprong interventions. This meeting provided a framework for developing such interventions.© 2019 Balakumaran et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695546>Management of Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors.</a></h2><p>Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are derived from neuroendocrine cell system and can have benign or malignant characteristics. They are rare tumors, but have been increasing in incidence over the past 40 years. Patients with NENs may develop symptoms due to primary tumor invasion, metastasis, or from secretion of hormonally active tumor substances. Multiple imaging modalities are used for diagnosis and staging, including specialty scans such as In pentetreotide (Octreoscan) and Gallium-DOTATATE, along with endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, and biochemical marker testing. Treatment involves both surgical approach, for both primary and metastatic lesions, as well as medical management for symptom management and disease progression. This article will review the current clinical knowledge regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of these fascinating neoplasms and the associated hormonal syndromes.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694704>Isolation of bioactive compounds from Bergenia ciliata (haw.) Sternb rhizome and their antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities.</a></h2><p>Bergenia ciliata is a medicinal plant used for the treatment of diarrhea, vomiting, fever, cough, , cancer, pulmonary disorders and wound healing.In this study, Bergenia ciliata crude extract, subfractions, and isolated compounds were evaluated for their antioxidant and anticholinesterase potential. The free radical scavenging capacities of the extracts determined using DPPH and ABTS assays. The anticholinesterase potentials were determined using acetylcholine esterase and butyryl choline esterase enzymes. To determine the phytochemical composition, the extracts were subjected to HPLC analysis and silica gel column isolation. Based on HPLC fingerprinting results, the ethyl acetate fraction was found to have more bioactive compounds and was therefore subjected to silica gel column isolation. As a result, three compounds; pyrogallol, rutin, and morin were isolated in the pure state. The structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated using spectroscopic techniques like H-NMR, IR and UV-Visible.The crude extract showed maximum anticholinesterase (acetylcholinesterase = 90.22 ± 1.15% and butyrylcholinesterase = 88.22 ± 0.71%) and free radical scavenging (87.37 ± 2.45 and 83.50 ± 0.70% respectively against DPPH and ABTS radicals) potentials. The total phenolic contents (expressed as equivalent of gallic acid; mgGAE/g) were higher in ethyl acetate fraction (80.96 ± 1.74) followed by crude extract (70.65 ± 0.86) while the flavonoid contents (expressed as quercetin equivalent; mgQE/g) and were higher in crude extract (88.40 ± 1.12) followed by n-butanol fraction (60.10 ± 1.86). The isolated bioactive compounds pyrogallol, rutin, and morin were found active against ABTS and DPPH free radicals. Amongst them, pyrogallol was more active against both free radicals. Reasonable anticholinesterase activities were recorded for pyrogallol against selected enzymes.The extracts and isolated compounds showed antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory potentials. It was concluded that this plant could be helpful in the treatment of oxidative stress and neurological disorders if used in the form of extracts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693916>Evaluation of the incretin effect in humans using GIP and GLP-1 receptor antagonists.</a></h2><p>Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion and are therefore thought to be responsible for the incretin effect. The magnitude of the incretin effect, defined as the fraction of postprandial insulin secretion stimulated by intestinal factors, has been reported to be up to ∼60% in healthy individuals. In several pathological conditions but especially in patients with type 2 , the incretin effect is severely reduced or even absent. In line with this, the insulinotropic effects of GIP and GLP-1 are impaired in patients with type 2 , even when administered in supraphysiological doses. In healthy individuals, GIP has been proposed to be the most important incretin hormone of the two, but the individual contribution of the two is difficult to determine. However, using incretin hormone receptor antagonists: the novel GIP receptor antagonist GIP(3-30)NH and the widely used GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin(9-39)NH, we can now distinguish between the effects of the two hormones. In this review, we present and discuss studies in which the individual contribution of GIP and GLP-1 to the incretin effect in healthy individuals have been estimated and discuss the limitations of using incretin hormone receptor antagonists.Copyright © 2019.

We followed pregnant women aged 15 to 45 from GDM diagnosis through delivery and assessed outcomes using maternity care and hospitalization data. We adjusted for covariates using inverse probability of treatment weights and multiple imputation for missing covariate information. We estimated unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios (RRs), risk differences (RDs) per 100, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Linear regression was used to estimate the association of treatment with birthweight. We stratified analyses by ethnicity and infant sex in prespecified sensitivity analyses.We compared 3818 metformin-treated pregnancies with 3450 insulin-treated pregnancies. We observed differences in treatment initiation by ethnicity, socioeconomic status, region, and calendar year. Treatment groups were similar in age, body mass index (BMI), and timing of diagnosis/treatment initiation. After adjustment, metformin was associated with reduced absolute risk of planned elective c-section (RD = -2.3, 95% CI, -4.3 to -0.3), large for gestational age (RD = -3.7, 95% CI, -5.5 to -1.8), and neonatal hypoglycemia (RD = -5.0, 95% CI, -6.9 to -3.2) compared with insulin. There were no clinically meaningful differences in average birthweight between metformin- and insulin-treated pregnancies. We observed variation in estimates by ethnicity and infant sex for some neonatal outcomes.Metformin appears to be an effective treatment for women with GDM and may reduce risk of some adverse neonatal outcomes when compared with insulin.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695624>Acetaldehyde Induces an Endothelium-Dependent Relaxation of Superior Mesenteric Artery: Potential Role in Postprandial Hyperemia.</a></h2><p>Acetaldehyde (AA) is a small, ubiquitous compound present in foods, beverages, as a gas phase combustion product, and also endogenously generated from metabolism as from ethanol (EtOH). Acetate is a short chain fatty acid derived from AA oxidation, and acetate levels were significantly higher in urine collected overnight with food provided  compared with urine collected after 9 h fasting. Feeding increases gastrointestinal blood flow, and thus, we explored the direct effects of AA (and acetate) in isolated murine superior mesenteric artery (SMA). Over the concentration range of 1-100 mM, AA strongly, and reversibly relaxed agonist-induced contractions of SMA including phenylephrine (PE), thromboxane A analog (U46,619) and high potassium (High K) without toxicity. The sensitivity (EC) but not the efficacy (>90% relaxation of PE-precontraction) of AA-induced relaxations was dependent on blood vessel (SMA was 3× more sensitive than aorta) and contractile agonist (PE EC = 3.3 ± 0.4 mM; U46,619 EC = 14.9 ± 1.5 mM; and High K EC = 17.7 ± 0.5 mM) yet independent of circadian cycle and sex. The most sensitive component of the AA-induced relaxation was inhibited significantly by: (1) a mechanically impaired endothelium; (2) nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor (L-NAME); and (3) a guanylyl cyclase (GC) inhibitor (ODQ). Both acetate and EtOH stimulated much weaker relaxations in SMA than did AA, yet these relaxations were significantly inhibited by L-NAME as well. Neither EtOH nor acetate relaxed pre-contracted aorta. Although neither cyanamide, a non-specific aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme inhibitor, nor Alda-1, a specific activator of ALDH2 activity, had any effect on either sensitivity or efficacy of AA-induced relaxation in SMA, cyanamide significantly blocked both EtOH- and acetate-induced relaxations in SMA implicating a role of ALDH activity in vasorelaxation. These data show that AA relaxes SMA via an endothelium- and NO-dependent mechanism indicating that AA may be one component of the complex post-prandial hyperemia reflex via vasodilatation of mesenteric vasculature.Copyright © 2019 Jin, Lorkiewicz, Malovichko, Bhatnagar, Srivastava and Conklin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697972>Insulin sensitizer MSDC-0602K in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb study.</a></h2><p>MSDC-0602K is a novel insulin sensitizer designed to preferentially target the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier while minimizing direct binding to the transcriptional factor PPARγ. Herein, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of MSDC-0602K in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.Patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH and fibrosis (F1-F3) were randomized to daily oral placebo, or 1 of 3 MSDC-0602K doses in a 52-week double-blind study. The primary efficacy endpoint was hepatic histological improvement of ≥2 points in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) with a ≥1-point reduction in either ballooning or lobular inflammation and no increase in fibrosis stage at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included NAS improvement without worsening fibrosis, NASH resolution, and fibrosis reduction. Exploratory endpoints included changes in insulin sensitivity, liver injury and liver fibrosis markers.Patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 94), or 62.5 mg (n = 99), 125 mg (n = 98), or 250 mg (n = 101) of MSDC-0602K. At baseline, glycated hemoglobin was 6.4 ± 1.0%, 61.5% of patients had fibrosis F2/F3 and the average NAS was 5.3. The primary endpoint was reached in 29.7%, 29.8%, 32.9% and 39.5% of patients in the placebo, 62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg dose arms, respectively, with adjusted odds ratios relative to placebo of 0.89 (95% CI 0.44-1.81), 1.22 (95% CI 0.60-2.48), and 1.64 (95% CI 0.83-3.27). The 2 highest doses of MSDC-0602K led to significant reductions in glucose, glycated hemoglobin, insulin, liver enzymes and NAS compared to placebo. The incidence of hypoglycemia and PPARγ-agonist-associated events such as edema and fractures were similar in the placebo and MSDC-0602K groups.MSDC-0602K did not demonstrate statistically significant effects on primary and secondary liver histology endpoints. However, effects on non-invasive liver cell injury and measures of glucose metabolism support further exploration of MSDC-0602K's safety and potential efficacy in patients with type 2  and liver injury. [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: ].First-generation insulin sensitizers are used to treat type 2 , but are associated with side effects including edema, bone fractures, and hypoglycemia. MSDC-0602K is a second-generation insulin sensitizer designed to reduce these side effects. We hypothesized that insulin sensitization could improve non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In the current study of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, MSDC-0602K did not demonstrate significant effects on liver histology with the biopsy techniques used. However, useful information was gained for the design of future studies and MSDC-0602K significantly decreased fasting glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin, and markers of liver injury without dose-limiting side effects.Copyright © 2019.

Here we show that the i-AAA protease YME1L rewires the proteome of pre-existing mitochondria in response to hypoxia or nutrient starvation. Inhibition of mTORC1 induces a lipid signalling cascade via the phosphatidic acid phosphatase LIPIN1, which decreases phosphatidylethanolamine levels in mitochondrial membranes and promotes proteolysis. YME1L degrades mitochondrial protein translocases, lipid transfer proteins and metabolic enzymes to acutely limit mitochondrial biogenesis and support cell growth. YME1L-mediated mitochondrial reshaping supports the growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells as spheroids or xenografts. Similar changes to the mitochondrial proteome occur in the tumour tissues of patients with PDAC, suggesting that YME1L is relevant to the pathophysiology of these tumours. Our results identify the mTORC1-LIPIN1-YME1L axis as a post-translational regulator of mitochondrial proteostasis at the interface between metabolism and mitochondrial dynamics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691468>Dietary alpha-ketoglutarate promotes beige adipogenesis and prevents obesity in middle-aged mice.</a></h2><p>Aging usually involves the progressive development of certain illnesses, including  and obesity. Due to incapacity to form new white adipocytes, adipose expansion in aged mice primarily depends on adipocyte hypertrophy, which induces metabolic dysfunction. On the other hand, brown adipose tissue burns fatty acids, preventing ectopic lipid accumulation and metabolic diseases. However, the capacity of brown/beige adipogenesis declines inevitably during the aging process. Previously, we reported that DNA demethylation in the Prdm16 promoter is required for beige adipogenesis. DNA methylation is mediated by ten-eleven family proteins (TET) using alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) as a cofactor. Here, we demonstrated that the circulatory AKG concentration was reduced in middle-aged mice (10-month-old) compared with young mice (2-month-old). Through AKG administration replenishing the AKG pool, aged mice were associated with the lower body weight gain and fat mass, and improved glucose tolerance after challenged with high-fat diet (HFD). These metabolic changes are accompanied by increased expression of brown adipose genes and proteins in inguinal adipose tissue. Cold-induced brown/beige adipogenesis was impeded in HFD mice, whereas AKG rescued the impairment of beige adipocyte functionality in middle-aged mice. Besides, AKG administration up-regulated Prdm16 expression, which was correlated with an increase of DNA demethylation in the Prdm16 promoter. In summary, AKG supplementation promotes beige adipogenesis and alleviates HFD-induced obesity in middle-aged mice, which is associated with enhanced DNA demethylation of the Prdm16 gene.© 2019 The Authors.

Ongoing clinical trials aim to evaluate the effectiveness of approved antihypertensives in preventing dementia, including patients with and without hypertension. In order for a dementia prevention strategy using antihypertensives to be effective, it is critical to understand patient concerns about this strategy in both users and non-users of antihypertensives. Thus, this study examined the association between current use of antihypertensive and having concerns about using an antihypertensive as a dementia prevention strategy, as well as sociodemographic factors associated with concerns.Cross-sectional,  self-administered, web-based survey was conducted among 1661 patients in a large health system in January 2018. Participants reported whether they were currently taking an antihypertensive (yes/no), and what types of hypothetical concerns they have about the idea of taking an antihypertensive to prevent dementia (yes/no, for each of 7 concerns). Associations between the two variables were assessed via logistic regression, and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated.Most respondents were female (77%), 51-70 years of age (64%), and white (89%), with 30% reporting current antihypertensive use. Compared to current users, non-users were more likely to report the five following concerns: side effects from the medication, hassle to take medications, lack of evidence, not wanting to use medications, and already having normal/low blood pressure. Non-users were also less likely to report having no concerns (adjusted OR = 0.3; 95% CI = 0.2-0.4) compared to current users. Younger age and lower income were associated with having more concerns.Patients not currently using an antihypertensive are more likely to have concerns about using an antihypertensive for dementia prevention, compared to current antihypertensive users. Patient perspectives are important to consider for the implementation of dementia prevention strategies.© 2019 Lee et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695587>Prevalence of Liver Function Test Abnormality and Associated Factors in Type 2 : A Comparative Cross-Sectional Study.</a></h2><p>Determining liver biomarkers can help to screen and facilitate early management of potential liver diseases. However, such studies are scarce in the present study area. Therefore, our study planned to assess the prevalence of liver function test abnormality and associated factors among Type 2  (T2DM) patients.A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from January 1, 2018 to May 20, 2018 among 159 T2DM patients and 159 nondiabetic controls. Clinical, lifestyle, anthropometric data and 5 ml of blood were collected from all study subjects. Liver function tests (LFTs), lipid profiles and fasting blood sugar were determined. Systematic random sampling technique was used to select the study subjects. Binary logistic regression and bivariate correlation was used to assess association of factors with outcomes and p value of ≤0.05 was considered as significant.Overall, 53 (33.3%) of T2DM had one or more liver test abnormality above the upper limit of the normal (ULN) reference range. Alanine aminotransferase was the most frequently raised liver enzyme in T2DM (n=37, 23.3%). The mean value of LFTs was significantly different between T2DM and the control group. Alcohol drink, sex and age were found to be a significant factor for impairment of LFTs.The prevalence of abnormal LFTs was higher in T2DM patients than nondiabetic control group. Hence, we recommended the utilization of LFTs to monitor liver conditions in T2DM patients.Copyright © 2019 International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC).

Using comparative genomic hybridization of DNA from pancreatic lymph-nodes memory CD4 T cells of 25 diabetic NOD mice, we found lymphocyte-exclusive mosaic somatic copy-number aberrations (CNAs) with highly nonrandom independent involvement of the same gene(s) across different mice, some with an autoimmunity association (ex:  and ). We confirmed genes of interest using the gold standard approach for CNA quantification, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), as an independent method. As controls, we examined lymphocytes expanded during normal host defense (17 NOD and BALB/c mice infected with  parasite). Here, CNAs found were fewer and significantly smaller compared to those in autoreactive cells (P= 0.0019). We determined a low T cell clonality for our samples suggesting a pre-thymic formation of these CNAs. In this study, we are describing a novel, unexplored phenomenon of a potential causal contribution of PZMs in autoreactive T cells in T1D pathogenesis. We expect that further exploration of point mutations and studies in human T cells will enable the further delineation of driver genes to target for functional studies. Our findings challenge the classical notions of autoimmunity and open conceptual avenues toward individualized prevention and therapeutics.Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697435>Families with pediatric type 1 : A comparison with the general population on child well-being, parental distress and parenting behavior.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to compare families with a child (2-12 years) with type 1  (T1D) to families which are not confronted with chronic illness, with regard to children's well-being, parental distress, and parenting behavior. In addition, differences were explored between families whose child has optimal versus suboptimal glycemic control METHODS: Mothers, fathers, and children of 105 families with pediatric T1D completed questionnaires assessing child well-being, parental distress and parenting. The control group consisted of 414 families without chronic illness.With regard to child well-being, children with T1D had more adjustment difficulties (as reported by mothers) and lower quality of life (QoL) (as reported by mothers and fathers), whereas children themselves (8-12 years) reported higher QoL compared to controls. In terms of parental distress, mothers, but not fathers, of children with T1D reported more stress, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms than controls. With regard to parenting behavior, parent reports revealed less protectiveness in fathers and less autonomy support and responsiveness in both parents as compared to controls. No differences were found in parent-reported psychological control between parents of children with and without T1D, but children with T1D perceived lowered parental psychological control. Lastly, secondary analyses indicated that especially families with suboptimal child glycemic control showed more maternal distress and worse child well-being (according to parents).Families confronted with pediatric T1D differ from families without chronic illness: childhood T1D impacts parental perceptions of child well-being and differentially affects mothers' and fathers' distress levels and behaviors.

The action of insulin depends on its binding to membrane receptors on its target cells. We wonder if blood insulin could travel bound to proteins and if, in the presence of hyperinsulinemia, a soluble insulin receptor might be generated. We used young adult Wistar rats (which have no predisposition to obesity or ), whose drinking water was added 20 % of sugar and that were fed a standard diet ad libitum for two and six months. They were compared with control rats under the same conditions, but that had running water for consumption. At two months, the rats developed central obesity, moderate hypertension, high triglyceride levels, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, i.e. metabolic syndrome. Electrophoresis of the rats' plasma proteins was performed, followed by Western Blot (WB) for insulin and for the outer portion of the insulin receptor. The bands corresponding to insulin and to the receptor external part were at the same molecular weight level, 25-fold higher than that of free insulin. We demonstrated that insulin, both in control animals and in those with hyperinsulinemia, travels bound to the receptor outer portion (ectodomain), which we called soluble insulin receptor, and that is released al higher amounts in response to plasma insulin increase; in rats with metabolic syndrome and hyperinsulinemia, plasma levels are much higher than in controls. Soluble insulin receptor increase in blood might be an early sign of metabolic syndrome.Copyright: © 2019 Permanyer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696703>Mitochondria-targeting peptides and peptidomimetics: recent progress and design principles.</a></h2><p>Mitochondria are multifunctional subcellular organelles whose operations encompass energy production, signal transduction, and metabolic regulation. Given their wide range of roles, they have been studied extensively as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of various diseases including cancer, , and neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondria-mediated pathways have been identified as promising targets in the context of these diseases. However, the delivery of specific probes and drugs to the mitochondria remains as one of the major problems yet to be solved. Over the past decade, many efforts have been made to develop mitochondria-targeted delivery methods based on the membrane characteristics and the protein import machinery of mitochondria. While various methods utilizing small molecules to polymeric particles have been introduced, it is notable that many of these compounds share common structural elements and physicochemical properties for optimal selectivity and efficiency. In this perspective, we will overview most recently developed mitochondria-targeting peptides and peptidomimetics to outline the key aspects of structural requirement and design principle. We will also discuss successful and potential applications of mitochondrial delivery to assess opportunities and challenges in mitochondria-targeting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693492>A new prospective on the role of melatonin in  and its complications.</a></h2><p>Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland under the control of the circadian rhythm, and is released in the dark and suppressed during the day. In the past decades, melatonin has been considered to be used in the treatment for  (DM). This is due to a functional inter-relationship between melatonin and insulin. Elevated oxidative stress is a feature found in DM associated with diabetic neuropathy (DN), retinopathy (DR), nephropathy and cardiovascular disease. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen oxidative species (NOS) are usually produced in massive amounts via glucose and lipid peroxidation, and this leads to diabetic complications. At the molecular level, ROS causes damage to the biomolecules and triggers apoptosis. Melatonin, as an antioxidant and a free radical scavenger, ameliorates oxidative stress caused by ROS and NOS. Besides that, melatonin administration is proven to bring other anti-DM effects such as reducing cellular apoptosis and promoting the production of antioxidants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692767>[Erysipelas associated with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the labium majus after radiochemotherapy].</a></h2><p>The erysipelas is a bacterial infection most frequently due to (85% of cases) streptococcus β-hemolytic of group A (SGA), resulting in non-necrotizing dermo-hypodermitis. Many factors may play a role in its occurrence such as general factors: , immunosuppression, chemotherapy, radiotherapy as well as locoregional ports of entry such as leg ulcer, an insect bite, intertrigo. The occurrence of erysipelas associated with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma after radiochemotherapy is exceptional, requiring early treatment of dermo-hypodermitis as well as suitable and multidisciplinary management of the carcinoma. The mechanism of the occurrence of erysipelas after radiotherapy coincides with its pathophysiology. Indeed, this therapeutic component, which is very used to treat squamous cell carcinoma, alters lymphatic drainage resulting, very gradually, in lymph fibrosis thus weakening the defense mechanism. Its association with alteration of cellular immunity, also favored by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, can cause the occurrence of erysipelas in these patients. We report the case of a 50-year old female patient with a 1-year history of squamous cell carcinoma of the right labium majus treatment with radiochemotherapy with remission. Eight months later, the patient had recurrence. Evolution was marked by the appearance of a painful hot erythematous plaque on the right thigh suggesting erysipelas, confirmed by laboratory tests which showed an infection.

As a second-generation sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic drug, it can lower blood glucose level and delay the occurrence and development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore whether gliclazide had protective effects on high glucose and advanced glycation end products (AGEs)-induced injury of human mesangial cells (HMCs) and renal tubular epithelial cells.HMC and renal tubular epithelial cell lines [human kidney 2 (HK-2)] were cultured in vitro. All cells were then divided into the follow groups: 1) blank control group (5.6 mmol/L glucose), 2) AGEs group [400 μg/mL AGE-bovine serum albumin (AGE-BSA)], 3) high glucose group (25 mmol/L glucose), 4) gliclazide + AGEs group (400 μg/mL AGE-BSA + 20 μmol/L gliclazide) and 5) gliclazide + high glucose group (25 mmol/L glucose + 20 μmol/L gliclazide). Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was adopted to determine cell viability. Flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were measured as well. Furthermore, the mRNA expressions of receptor for AGE (RAGE), p22phox and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) were measured via fluorescence quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).Compared with control group, significantly accelerated apoptosis of HMCs and HK-2, increased MDA level, decreased SOD and GSH-Px levels, and up-regulated mRNA expressions of RAGE, p22phox and NF-κB were observed in HMCs and HK-2 of high glucose group and AGEs group. Meanwhile, there were obviously alleviated apoptosis of HMCs and HK-2, decreased MDA level, increased SOD and GSH-Px levels, as well as down-regulated mRNA expressions of RAGE, p22phox and NF-κB in HMCs and HK-2 of gliclazide group compared with high glucose and AGEs group. Furthermore, significant correlations were found between the mRNA expression of RAGE and the apoptosis rate of HMCs and HK-2 (HMCs: r=0.701, p=0.004 and HK-2: r=0.633, p=0.011).Gliclazide has protective effects on high glucose and AGEs-induced damage of glomerular mesangial cells and renal tubular epithelial cells via inhibiting RAGE-NADPH oxidase-NF-kB pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691508>BMI growth trajectory from ages 2 to 6 years and its association with maternal obesity,  during pregnancy, gestational weight gain, and breastfeeding.</a></h2><p>To identify latent BMI growth trajectories from ages 2 to 6 years and examine their independent associations with maternal prepregnancy obesity or overweight, pre-existing type 1 (T1D) or type 2  (T2D) or gestational  (GDM) with or without requiring antidiabetic medications during pregnancy, excessive gestational weight gain (EGWG), and breastfeeding ≤ 6 months.Data included 71 892 children born at Kaiser Permanente Southern California hospitals in 2007 to 2011 with complete information on maternal risk factors. Group-based trajectory modelling was used to identify latent BMI trajectory groups. Logistic regression was used to assess independent associations adjusted for covariates.Three distinct BMI trajectory groups were identified: Group 1 (59% of the cohort) had stable low BMI, Group 2 (35% of the cohort) had stable median BMI, and Group 3 (6% of the cohort) had high and increasing BMI over time. Relative to Groups 1 and 2 combined, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) of being in Group 3 associated with maternal exposures were 5.6 (5.1-6.2) for prepregnancy obesity, 2.4 (2.2-2.7) for prepregnancy overweight, 2.1 (1.2-3.7) for T1D, 1.6 (1.4-1.8) for T2D, 1.4 (1.3-1.6) for GDM requiring medication treatment, 1.1 (1.0-1.3) for GDM not requiring medication, 1.3 (1.2-1.4) for EGWG, and 1.2 (1.2-1.3) for breastfeeding ≤ 6 months.Child's high and increasing BMI trajectory was strongly associated with maternal prepregnancy obesity and overweight, modestly associated with maternal T1D, T2D, and GDM requiring medication treatment and EGWG, and slightly associated with breastfeeding ≤ 6 months.

This makes it difficult to design proper ulcer prevention strategies for patients. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the foot function, foot strength and health of people with  (DM)-with or without DPN-while considering the different ulcer risk classifications determined by the IWGDF.The subject pool comprised 72 people with DM, with and without DPN. The patients were divided into three groups: Group 0 (G0), which comprised diabetic patients without DPN; Group 1 (G1), which comprised patients with DPN; and Group 2 (G2), which comprised patients with DPN who had foot deformities. The health and foot function of the subjects' feet were assessed using a foot health status questionnaire (FHSQ-BR) that investigated four domains: foot pain, foot function, footwear, and general foot health. The patients' foot strength was evaluated using the maximum force under each subject's hallux and toes on a pressure platform (emed q-100, Novel, Munich, Germany).Moderate differences were found between G0 and G1 and G2 for the foot pain, foot function, general foot health, and footwear. There was also a small but significant difference between G0 and G2 in regards to hallux strength.Foot health, foot function and strength levels of people with DM and DPN classified by the ulcer risk are different and this must be taken into account when evaluating and developing treatment strategies for these patients.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697150>Glycemic control influences on academic performance in youth with Type 1 .</a></h2><p>This study examined how children's and adolescents' with Type 1  glucose levels during and prior to academic assessment contributed to performance on reading, writing, and mathematics tasks. Participants had a mean age of 13.69 (SD = 2.10); 44.6% were female and 58.1% reported their ethnicity to be Hispanic, Latino, or Mexican. They wore a continuous glucose monitor for approximately 6 days and completed a neurobehavioral evaluation that consisted of tasks assessing basic reading skills, reading fluency, reading comprehension, math fact fluency, math calculation, spelling, and writing fluency. Results indicated that individuals whose glucose levels were suboptimal (>140 mg/dL) or hyperglycemic (>180 mg/dL) had significantly lower scores on reading fluency (ηp2 = .16) and writing fluency (ηp2 = .28) subtests than those in the target range (70-140 mg/dL). Moreover, more time spent hypoglycemic (<70 mg/dL) within the 12 hr prior to the evaluation increased the risk for impaired performance on academic tasks. These findings support the need to move beyond considering only overall glycemic control to review temporal influences of glucose levels on academic performance. By tracking how fluctuations impact academic performance, school based practitioners can better determine necessary accommodations to buffer glycemic dysregulation effects. In particular, individuals whose glucose levels are frequently outside of the target range are at greatest risk for performing below their true academic potential.

After 2011, the 2 largest laboratory companies in the United States implemented tacrolimus quantification by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS); this method excludes metabolites, potentially resulting in lower quantified drug concentrations. We sought to determine if tacrolimus therapeutic drug monitoring via LC-MS, as performed using trough targets originally derived from IA values, influences clinical outcomes.In a single-center retrospective cohort study of lung transplant recipients, risks of acute kidney injury, acute renal failure, and new-onset  after transplantation, as well as chronic lung allograft dysfunction-free survival, were compared in 82 subjects monitored by LC-MS and 102 subjects monitored by IA using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age, sex, baseline renal function, and race.LC-MS-based monitoring was associated with a greater risk of acute kidney injury (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.67). No statistically significant differences in risks of acute renal failure and new-onset  after transplantation were observed.Although LC-MS provides a more accurate representation of the blood concentration of the parent compound tacrolimus exclusive of metabolite, established cut points for tacrolimus dosing may need to be adjusted to account for the increased risk of renal injury.© American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2019.

Diabetic complication is related with structural and functional changes of brain. Studies investigated that homocysteine as an independent risk factor of several organ complications. This marker might have a role in pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in T2DM patients. We aimed to know the association between serum homocysteine level and cognitive impairment in middle-aged T2DM populations. The study was a cross-sectional study involving 97 T2DM patients aged <60 years old. Cognitive assessment was based on validated Indonesian version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-INA) test. Besides, serum homocysteine level (Hcy) was measured based on standard laboratory assay. Filling out the questionnaire of MoCA-INA was conducted when patients came to take the blood sample. This study used independent t-test, chi-square and multivariate logistic regression model to analyze the data. There were 47 subjects (48.5%) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Delayed recall was the most impaired domain (94.8%). There was no significant mean difference of serum Hcy level in MCI and non-MCI group (11.99±3.27 μmol/L vs 12.36±4.07 μmol/L respectively, p = 0.62). Final model of logistic regression showed no association between serum Hcy and cognitive function after adjusting confounding variables (OR: 1.778; 95%CI: 0.69-4.54).

Identifying and predicting these diseases in patients is the first step towards stopping their progression. We evaluate the capabilities of machine learning models in detecting at-risk patients using survey data (and laboratory results), and identify key variables within the data contributing to these diseases among the patients.Our research explores data-driven approaches which utilize supervised machine learning models to identify patients with such diseases. Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, we conduct an exhaustive search of all available feature variables within the data to develop models for cardiovascular, prediabetes, and  detection. Using different time-frames and feature sets for the data (based on laboratory data), multiple machine learning models (logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, and gradient boosting) were evaluated on their classification performance. The models were then combined to develop a weighted ensemble model, capable of leveraging the performance of the disparate models to improve detection accuracy. Information gain of tree-based models was used to identify the key variables within the patient data that contributed to the detection of at-risk patients in each of the diseases classes by the data-learned models.The developed ensemble model for cardiovascular disease (based on 131 variables) achieved an Area Under - Receiver Operating Characteristics (AU-ROC) score of 83.1% using no laboratory results, and 83.9% accuracy with laboratory results. In  classification (based on 123 variables), eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) model achieved an AU-ROC score of 86.2% (without laboratory data) and 95.7% (with laboratory data). For pre-diabetic patients, the ensemble model had the top AU-ROC score of 73.7% (without laboratory data), and for laboratory based data XGBoost performed the best at 84.4%. Top five predictors in  patients were 1) waist size, 2) age, 3) self-reported weight, 4) leg length, and 5) sodium intake. For cardiovascular diseases the models identified 1) age, 2) systolic blood pressure, 3) self-reported weight, 4) occurrence of chest pain, and 5) diastolic blood pressure as key contributors.We conclude machine learned models based on survey questionnaire can provide an automated identification mechanism for patients at risk of  and cardiovascular diseases.

Little is known about related clinical and demographic components contributing to these differences. We examined differences in HbA between adults who have T2DM with and without major depression. T-tests and chi-square analyses measured differences in HbA and clinical/demographic variables. HbA was statistically higher in depressed participants compared to non-depressed participants. The difference was no longer statistically significant after controlling for age. Age and HbA were negatively correlated across the sample and were still correlated in each group independently. The interaction of age and HbA was moderated by depression status. Additionally, mechanisms for  severity differences were assessed using moderation analyses and Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition technique. Seventy-four percent of the mean outcome HbA difference between depressed and non-depressed diabetic participants was explained by age. Furthermore, age was negatively correlated with clinical variables, such as diastolic blood pressure and cholesterol.

Some patients with functional upper gastrointestinal symptoms have impaired glucose tolerance during enteral dextrose infusion. Our hypothesis was that variants in CCK, GLP-1, and TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7-like 2 locus), which is associated with greatest genetic risk for development of type 2 , are associated with GE and independently with glucose tolerance. Our aims were to evaluate the associations between these GE, glucose tolerance, and these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).Genetic variants, scintigraphic GE of solids, plasma glucose, insulin, and GLP-1 during enteral dextrose infusion (75gm over 2 hours) were measured. GE and enteral dextrose infusion were, respectively, evaluated in 44 (27 controls and 17 patients with functional dyspepsia or nausea) and 42 (28 controls, 14 patients) participants; of these, 51 participants consented to assessment of SNPs. Four functional SNPs were studied: rs6923761 and rs1042044 at GLP-1 receptor, rs7903146 (TCF7L2), and rs1800857 (CCK receptor).Gastric emptying was normal in 38, rapid in 4, and delayed in two participants; 38 had normal, and four had impaired glucose tolerance. The T allele at rs7903146 (TCF7L2) was non-significantly associated (P = .14) with faster GE. The associations between SNPs and demographic variables, GE t , glucose tolerance and plasma GLP1 levels were not significant.There is a trend toward an association between faster GE and the -associated allele at rs7903146 in TCF7L2.

Previous studies of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the skeletal muscle membrane found insufficient increases to explain the increases in glucose uptake. By determination of leg glucose uptake and interstitial muscle glucose concentration we calculated insulin-induced muscle membrane permeability to glucose 4 h after one-legged knee-extensor exercise during a submaximal euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp. We found during submaximal insulin stimulation that muscle membrane permeability to glucose in humans increases twice as much in previously exercised vs. rested muscle and it outstrips the supply of glucose which then becomes limiting for glucose uptake. This methodology can now be employed to determine muscle membrane permeability to glucose in people with , who have reduced insulin action, and in principle can also be used to determine membrane permeability to other substrates or metabolites.Increased insulin action is an important component of the health benefits of exercise, but the regulation of insulin action in vivo is complex and not fully elucidated. Increases in skeletal muscle insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation are inconsistent and mostly cannot explain the increases in insulin action in humans. Here we used leg glucose uptake (LGU) and interstitial muscle glucose concentration to calculate insulin-induced muscle membrane permeability to glucose, a variable not previously possible to quantify in humans. Muscle membrane permeability to glucose, measured 4 h after one-legged knee-extensor exercise, increased ∼17-fold during a submaximal euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp in rested muscle (R) and ∼36-fold in exercised muscle (EX). Femoral arterial infusion of L-NMMA or ATP decreased and increased, respectively, leg blood flow (LBF) in both legs but did not affect membrane glucose permeability. Decreasing LBF reduced interstitial glucose concentrations to ∼2 mM in the exercised but only to ∼3.5 mM in non-exercised muscle and abrogated the augmented effect of insulin on LGU in the EX leg. Increasing LBF by ATP infusion increased LGU in both legs with uptake higher in the EX leg. We conclude that it is possible to measure functional muscle membrane permeability to glucose in humans and it increases twice as much in exercised vs. rested muscle during submaximal insulin stimulation. We also show that muscle perfusion is an important regulator of muscle glucose uptake when membrane permeability to glucose is high and we show that the capillary wall can be a significant barrier for glucose transport.

Diet management and plant-based formulations can improve the metabolic status of patients, being used as adjuvants of classic antidiabetic therapy. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the impact of a plant-based antidiabetic formulation (PBAF), containing Vaccinium myrtillus, Ribes nigrum, Rosa canina and Capsicum annuum, on the increased oxidative burden found in , comparing it with the effects of metformin and gliclazide. Firstly, we characterized the individual plant-derived components of this formulation and also assessed their in vitro radical scavenging capacity. We devised a preclinical study protocol to examine the impact of the PBAF, along metformin and gliclazide, on tissue histology as well as on the redox status of tissue, mitochondria, serum and serum lipoproteins of alloxan-induced diabetic Wistar rats. Subsequently, we assessed their long-term impact on the redox status of serum and isolated serum lipoproteins of type 2 DM (T2DM) patients, taking into consideration their cardiometabolic profile. In the preclinical stage, we found that PBAF was able to enhance total serum antioxidant defense, while metformin yielded the best results regarding the advanced glycation and protein/lipid oxidation of serum and of serum lipoproteins. The latter also improved overall serum redox status and HDL redox function. Also, antidiabetic treatment seemed to increase mitochondrial redox activity, without overturning overall tissue redox balance. Histologically, liver and brain tissues of treated diabetic rats were fairly similar to those of non-diabetic rats. In T2DM patients, the most striking results involved the effects on serum lipoproteins. The tested PBAF exerted protective antioxidant effects on low-density and, especially, on high density lipoproteins. We conclude that this formulation might constitute a good addition to the well-established pharmacological approach of DM, contributing to the reduction of overall oxidative burden.Copyright © 2019.

Its involvement in psoriasis development is still controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible effect of anti-HCV direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment on cutaneous psoriasis. Thirty-seven consecutive HCV patients with cutaneous psoriasis underwent efficacious DAA treatment, and all of them were efficiently cured as shown by HCV RNA negativity 24 weeks after stopping therapy (PT24W). An expert dermatologist evaluated the skin lesions at baseline, end of treatment (EOT), and at PT24W using the psoriasis area severity index (PASI) scoring system. The impact on Quality of life was measured with the Dermatologic Quality of Life Index (DLQI). Six patients had a stable disease throughout the study period, whereas 31/37 patients (83.8%) showed a significant improvement of the skin lesions at EOT (p<0.0001). However, 24 of these 31 patients (77.4%) had a dramatic worsening of the psoriatic lesions at PT24W compared to EOT (p<0.001), with lesion severity comparable to baseline. The outcome of psoriasis during and after treatment was independent of baseline PASI score, age, sex, HCV genotype, liver disease stage as well as of the presence of arterial hypertension,  and autoimmune diseases. In conclusion, DAA-based HCV cure has only a transient effect on skin lesions of patients with concomitant cutaneous psoriasis.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692777>Adherence to insulin therapy and associated factors among patients with  in public hospitals of Central Zone of Tigray, Ethiopia, 2018: a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>Adherence to insulin therapy is a critical factor for adequate control of .

The performance of the sensor over multiple, sequential 90- or 180-day cycles from real-world experience and clinical studies has not been previously published.The Eversense Data Management System (DMS) was used to evaluate the accuracy of GDPR-compliant sensor glucose (SG) values against self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) from June 2016 through August 2019 among patients with at least four sensor cycles from European and South African health care practices. Mean SG and associated measures of variability, glucose management indicator (GMI), and percent and time in various hypoglycemic, euglycemic, and hyperglycemic ranges were calculated for the 24-hour time period over each cycle. In addition, transmitter wear time was evaluated across each sensor wear cycle.Among the 945 users included in the analysis, the mean absolute relative difference (MARD) (SD) using 152,206, 174,645, 206,024, and 172,587 calibration matched pairs against SMBG was 11.9% (3.6%), 11.5% (4.0%), 11.8% (4.7%) and 11.5% (4.1%) during the first four sensor cycles, respectively. Mean values of the CGM metrics over the first sensor cycle were 156.5 mg/dL for SG, 54.7 mg/dL for SD, 0.35 for CV, and 7.04% for GMI. Percent SG at different glycemic ranges was as follows: <54 mg/dL was 1.1% (16 minutes), <70 mg/dL was 4.6% (66 minutes), ≥70 to 180 mg/dL (time-in-range) was 64.5% (929 minutes), >180-250 mg/dL was 22.8% (328 minutes) and >250 mg/dL was 8.1% (117 minutes). The median transmitter wear time over the first cycle was 83.2%.

However, rapid N-terminal enzymatic cleavage of PYY in the circulation dramatically diminishes NPYR1 specificity. The aim of the current study was to investigate antidiabetic efficacy of enzymatically stable PYY peptides.N-terminally stabilised, PYY(1-36) sequences from phylogenetically ancient fish, namely Amia calva (bowfin), Oncorhynchus mykiss (trout), Petromyzon marinus (sea lamprey) and Scaphirhynchus albus (sturgeon), were synthesised and both biological actions and antidiabetic therapeutic efficacy assessed.All fish PYY(1-36) peptides were resistant to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) degradation and inhibited glucose- and alanine-induced (P<0.05 to P<0.001) insulin secretion. In addition, PYY(1-36) peptides imparted significant (P<0.05 to P<0.001) beta-cell proliferative and anti-apoptotic benefits. Proliferative effects were almost entirely absent in beta-cells with CRISPR-Cas9 induced knockout of Npyr1. In contrast to human PYY(1-36), the piscine-derived peptides lacked appetite suppressive actions. Twice daily administration of sea lamprey PYY(1-36), the superior bioactive peptide, for 21-days significantly (P<0.05 to P<0.001) decreased fluid intake, non-fasting glucose and glucagon in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. In addition, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, pancreatic insulin and glucagon content were significantly improved. Metabolic benefits were linked to positive changes in pancreatic islet morphology, as a result of augmented (P<0.001) proliferation and decreased apoptosis of beta-cells. Sturgeon PYY(1-36) exerted similar but less impressive effects in STZ mice.The current observations reveal, for the first time, that PYY(1-36) peptide sequences from phylogenetically ancient fish replicate the pancreatic beta-cell benefits of human PYY(1-36) and possess clear potential for the treatment of type 2 .

Over the last 40 years since first discovered, Reg proteins have been implicated in a gamut of maladies including , various types of cancer of the digestive tract, and Alzheimer disease. Surprisingly though, a consensus is still absent on the regulation of their expression, and molecular underpinning of their function. Here, we provide a critical appraisal of recent findings in the field of Reg protein biology. Specifically, the structural characteristics are reviewed particularly in connection with established or purported functions of different members of the Reg family. Moreover, Reg expression patterns in different tissues both under normal and pathophysiological conditions are summarized. Putative receptors and cascades reported to relay Reg signaling inciting cellular responses are presented aiming at a better appreciation of the biological activities of the distinct Reg moieties. Challenges are also discussed that have hampered thus far the rapid progress in this field such as the use of non-standard nomenclature for Reg molecules among various research groups, the existence of multiple Reg members with significant degree of homology and possibly compensatory modes of action, and the need for common assays with robust readouts of Reg activity. Coordinated research is warranted going forward, given that several research groups have independently linked Reg proteins to diseased states and raised the possibility that these biomolecules can serve as therapeutic targets and biomarkers.Copyright © 2019 Chen, Downing and Tzanakakis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692373>Safety and effectiveness of an investigational insulin delivery device providing basal/bolus therapy with rapid-acting or regular human insulin in adults with type 2 .</a></h2><p>This study undertook to assess usability, 24-hour glycemic profiles, and safety of an investigational basal/bolus insulin delivery device (IDD) providing rapid-acting or regular human insulin (RHI) for people with type 2  (T2D) transitioning from multiple daily insulin injections (MDI).This prospective, single-center, open-label, two-period study enrolled adults with T2D and HbA1c 7-11% (53-97 mmol/mol). Participants continued usual MDI therapy during a 2-3-day in-clinic MDI period and then within 7 days were switched to the IDD, using current insulin dose, for a 6-day in-clinic IDD period, with blinded continuous glucose monitoring throughout in-clinic periods.We enrolled 21 participants (mean±SD age 57±8 years; HbA1c 8.2±0.9% [66±9.8 mmol/mol]) using U-100 insulin lispro (n=11) or switched to U-100 RHI (n=10).

However, changes in the topological properties of the functional brain connectome in diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients remain unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the topological organization of the brain connectome in DR patients using graph theory approaches.Thirty-five DR patients (18 males and 17 females) and 38 healthy controls (HCs) (18 males and 20 females), matched for age, sex, and education, underwent resting-state magnetic resonance imaging scans. Graph theory analysis was performed to investigate the topological properties of brain functional connectome at both global and nodal levels.Both DR and HC groups showed high-efficiency small-world network in their brain functional networks. Notably, the DR group showed reduction in the clustering coefficient (=0.0572) and local efficiency (=0.0151). Furthermore, the DR group showed reduced nodal centralities in the default-mode network (DMN) and increased nodal centralities in the visual network (VN) (<0.01, Bonferroni-corrected). The DR group also showed abnormal functional connections among the VN, DMN, salience network (SN), and sensorimotor network (SMN). Altered network metrics and nodal centralities were significantly correlated with visual acuity and fasting blood glucose level in DR patients.DR patients showed abnormal topological organization of the human brain connectome. Specifically, the DR group showed reduction in the clustering coefficient and local efficiency, relative to HC group. Abnormal nodal centralities and functional disconnections were mainly located in the DMN, VN, SN, and SMN in DR patients. Furthermore, the disrupted topological attributes showed correlations with clinical variables. These findings offer important insight into the neural mechanism of visual loss and cognitive deficits in DR patients.© 2019 Huang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696840>Effects and association of pro-oxidants with magnesium in patients with diabetic nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most common microvascular complication observed in patients with type-2 . Furthermore, magnesium (Mg) deficiency is a common problem in diabetic patients. In this study, we estimated the levels of Mg, which is an important trace element and pro-oxidant marker, and then evaluated the association between serum Mg and pro-oxidants in patients with DN. In the present study, 200 patients were enrolled and were divided into two groups. The control and DN groups consisted of 100 healthy individuals and 100 patients with DN, respectively. Serum Mg, total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were estimated using the Calmagite, Koracevic, and Marklund and Marklund methods, respectively. Glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were estimated using the Tietze F and Jean CD method, respectively. Mg levels were found to be significantly decreased in the DN group in comparison to the control group. Anti-oxidant markers were statistically significantly reduced (P <0.001), whereas MDA levels were statistically significantly elevated (P <0.001) in the DN group compared to the control group. There was a significant positive association of Mg with TAC, SOD, and GSH. A statistically significant negative association of Mg with MDA (r = -0.302, P <0.001, n = 100) was also observed.

To determine if and which aspects of signaling (basal, circadian, integrative, or reactivity) are associated with specific health outcomes, we reviewed recent studies that relate GCs to health outcomes. We identified papers through PubMed and reviewed 100 original research articles related to mental health, cardiovascular health, cancer, , obesity, pulmonary health, sleep, and fitness. Many studies reported elevated GC secretion associated with worse health, but this was only particularly true for integrative GC measures. On the other hand, accentuated cortisol awakening response and a steeper circadian rhythm were both associated with positive health outcomes. Overall, relationships between GC secretion and health outcomes were relatively weak. This systematic review of relationships between GC metrics and health outcomes highlights the importance of careful consideration when selecting methods to measure GC regulation in health research.Copyright © 2019.

The morisky 8 item medication adherence scale was used to develop 10 item tool for evaluation of dietary adherence. Multiple logistic regression was conducted to identify factors which affect dietary adherence and variables with P vale < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.More than half of 303 participants (55.7%) were found to be non-adherent to the recommended dietary approach. Gathering with family and friends and eating out were the major reasons for not being compliant with the recommended regimen. Attending diabetic nutrition education (AOR=2.8 95% C 1.97, 5.61) and having the disease for more than 10 years (AOR 2.9 95% CI 1.32, 5.84) were statistically significant with adherence to dietary recommendation.Non-adherence to recommended dietary practice was observed in more than fifty percent of patients; it is therefore a major public health problem.

In this study, we evaluated effects of myricetin on high glucose (HG)-elicited oxidative damage in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The cells were pre-incubated with myricetin and then treated with HG to induce apoptosis. The effect of myricetin on viability was investigated by MTT assay. The levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO) were determined by thiobarbituric acid (TBA) method. The protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 was measured by western blot analysis. Moreover, the effect of myricetin on total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total thiol molecules was also determined. Our results showed that myricetin was able to markedly restore the viability of endothelial cells under oxidative stress. Myricetin reduced HG-caused increase in LPO levels. Also, TAC and total thiol molecules were notably elevated by myricetin. Incubation with myricetin decreased the protein expression levels of Bax, whereas it increased the expression levels of the Bcl-2, compared with HG treatment alone. Furthermore, myricetin significantly decreased cleaved caspase-3 protein expression. It is concluded that myricetin may protect HUVECs from oxidative stress induced by HG via increasing cell TAC and reducing Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio, and caspase-3 expression.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695393>The potential risk factors of cortical visual impairment following cerebral angiography: a retrospective study.</a></h2><p>Cortical visual impairment is an uncommon complication after cerebral angiography with an incidence of 0.3%-1.0%.

Heterozygous inactivating mutations involving the maternal GNAS exons 1-13 that encodes the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gsα) cause inactivating parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTHrP signalling disorder type 2 (iPPSD2 or PHP type 1A), which is characterized by Albright hereditary osteodystrophy and resistance to multiple hormones that act through the Gsα signalling pathway (including PTH, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone). To date, little information is available on craniofacial features in patients with PHP. The small number of patients studied in previous reports as well as the lack of molecular characterization of the patients may have precluded the detection of specific orofacial manifestations in the different PHP subtypes.We conducted a systematic analysis of dental and craniofacial features in 19 patients with iPPSD2 and maternal GNAS inactivating mutations to assess the frequency and specificity of the anomalies.Facial examinations showed reduced vertical, sagittal, and transverse development of the mid-facial structures. Intraoral and radiographic examinations revealed that 89 per cent of the patients had at least one dental anomaly, including tooth submergence leading to severe infraocclusion in 83 per cent of cases. Craniofacial analysis of lateral cephalometric radiographs also showed a significant alteration in the development of the cranial base and maxillary and mandibular structures in these patients.Patients with iPPSD2 and maternal GNAS mutations had specific craniofacial alterations and dental abnormalities. These specific defects should be assessed in order to provide appropriate dental and orthodontic care to these patients.

Furthermore, as seed cells in tissue engineering, SCs have been applied widely to tissue and organ regeneration. However, previous studies have shown that SCs are heterogeneous and consist of many cell subpopulations. Owing to this heterogeneity of cell states, gene expression is highly diverse between cells even within a single tissue, making precise identification and analysis of biological properties difficult, which hinders their further research and applications. Therefore, a defined understanding of the heterogeneity is a key to research of SCs. Traditional ensemble-based sequencing approaches, such as microarrays, reflect an average of expression levels across a large population, which overlook unique biological behaviors of individual cells, conceal cell-to-cell variations, and cannot understand the heterogeneity of SCs radically. The development of high throughput single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has provided a new research tool in biology, ranging from identification of novel cell types and exploration of cell markers to the analysis of gene expression and predicating developmental trajectories. scRNA-seq has profoundly changed our understanding of a series of biological phenomena. Currently, it has been used in research of SCs in many fields, particularly for the research of heterogeneity and cell subpopulations in early embryonic development.

Although MetS affects one third of American adults, its pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. Tyramine, a derivative of tyrosine, has been shown to act as a catecholamine releasing agent in the human body. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of tyramine as an early biomarker for nascent MetS without the confounding of T2DM, ASCVD or smoking. Patients and methods This was an exploratory study of 28 patients with nascent MetS and 20 matched controls carried out in 2018. Metabolites were evaluated from patient's frozen early morning urine samples and were correlated with biomarkers of inflammation and adipokines. They were assayed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Western Metabolomics Center using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and standardized to urinary creatinine. All patients had normal hepatic and renal function. Results Tyramine concentrations were significantly reduced in patients with MetS compared to controls, p = 0.0009. In addition, tyramine was significantly inversely correlated with multiple biomarkers of inflammation and cardiometabolic risk factors such as RBP4, monocyte TLR-4 abundance and P38MAPKinase activity, body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure (BP) (both systolic and diastolic).

There exists a wide variation of preference for initial antidiabetes drugs (AD). The current database analysis aimed to understand the real world treatment patterns in drug-naive patients with T2DM in Japan.We analyzed data of patients (≥ 18 years) diagnosed with T2DM between October 2012 and September 2016 from the Medical Data Vision, a Diagnosis Procedure Combination database. The primary objective was to determine the proportion of T2DM patients receiving each type of treatment as first-line therapy among the drug-naive cohort.Of the 436,546 drug-naive patients, 224,761 received their first-line T2DM treatment in the outpatient setting. The mean age of the patient population was 65.6 years at index date. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor was the most prescribed (56.8%) outpatient AD monotherapy, followed by metformin (15.4%). DPP-4 inhibitors were prescribed over metformin in patients with renal disease (odds ratio [OR]: 4.20; p < 0.0001), coronary heart disease and stroke (OR: 2.22; p < 0.0001).

In all, 75.3% of patients had received tetrastarch with a crystalloid/colloid ratio of 2.93 ± 2.60. The 90-day mortality was 11.1%, and 7.8% of the patients developed severe AKF. After adjusting for confounders, we found a U-shaped, nonlinear association between absolute or relative volumes of tetrastarch and survival time (p = 0.003 and 0.025, respectively). Optimal relative volumes of tetrastarch approximately ranged from 20 to 30% of total fluids. Giving less than about 1000 ml, or more than about 2000 ml tetrastarch was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing severe AKF (p = 0.023).There was a complex U‑shaped association between the tetrastarch dose and morbidity/mortality of patients after a severe trauma injury. The optimal crystalloid/tetrastarch ratio for acute shock management appears to range from about 2.5 to 4.0.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696512>Predicting overall and major postoperative morbidity in gastric cancer patients.</a></h2><p>Postoperative complications after gastric cancer resection vary in different series and they might have a significant impact in long-term outcomes. Our aim was to build a prediction rule on gastric cancer patients' overall and major morbidity risks.This retrospective study included 1223 patients from a single center who were resected between 1992 and 2016. Overall and major morbidity predictors were identified through multiple logistic regression. Models' performances were assessed through discrimination, calibration, and cross-validation, and nomograms were constructed.The mean age was 61.3-year old and the male gender was more frequent (60%). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (HTN), , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A D2-distal gastrectomy was the most frequent procedure and 87% of all lesions were located in the middle or distal third. Age, COPD, coronary heart disease, chronic liver disease, pancreatic resection, and operative time were independent predictors of overall and major morbidity. The extent of resection and splenectomy was associated with overall events and HTN with major ones. Both models were very effective in predicting events among patients at higher risk.The overall and major morbidity models and nomograms included clinical- and surgical-related data that were very effective in predicting events, especially for high-risk patients.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693126>Association Between Antidiabetic Medications and Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels and Biopsy Results.</a></h2><p>Diabetic men appear to have a lower risk of prostate cancer. Whether antidiabetic medications are protective or potentially mask prostate cancer by lowering prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is unclear.To examine the associations of antidiabetic medication use with (1) PSA levels, (2) frequency of PSA testing, (3) receipt of biopsy following elevated PSA results, and (4) prostate cancer detection at biopsy.Population-based cohort study using data from the Stockholm PSA and Biopsy Register. Participants were all prostate cancer-free men aged 40 to 79 years residing in Stockholm County, Sweden, between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2015. Data were analyzed from November 2018 to March 2019.One or more prescription for metformin, sulfonylurea, or insulin, as recorded in Sweden's National Prescribed Drug Register.Levels of PSA following first exposure to antidiabetic medications were assessed using multivariable linear regression. Frequency of PSA testing was assessed via multivariable Poisson regression. Biopsy following elevated PSA (≥3.0 ng/mL) and prostate cancer detection at biopsy were assessed via multivariable logistic regression.The cohort of 564 666 men (median [range] age, 65 [40-79] years) consisted of 4583 men initially exposed to metformin, 1104 exposed to sulfonylurea, and 978 exposed to insulin who were age matched with unexposed men (1:5). Exposed men had lower median (interquartile range) PSA levels before starting antidiabetic medications compared with unexposed men (1.2 [0.7-2.5] vs 1.6 [0.8-3.2] ng/mL). After accounting for baseline differences, PSA levels did not vary from those of unexposed men following exposure to antidiabetic medications. Frequency of PSA testing was higher for those receiving metformin (rate ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.06-1.09) and sulfonylurea (rate ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.08) but was lower for those receiving insulin (rate ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.77- 0.81). Likelihood of biopsy after elevated PSA was lower among men receiving metformin (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.96) and insulin (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.93). There were no differences in prostate cancer detection at biopsy, regardless of PSA levels that triggered the biopsy.This study's findings do not support the hypothesis that the inverse association between  and prostate cancer is mediated through antidiabetic medications lowering PSA levels to mask prostate cancer. They do suggest potential detection bias due to fewer biopsies among men receiving antidiabetic medications, which may explain the lower prostate cancer risk in men with .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692562>K-means clustering of overweight and obese population using quantile-transformed metabolic data.</a></h2><p>Use of K-means clustering for big data technology to cluster an overweight and obese population metabolically.K-means clustering with the help of quantile transformation of attribute values was applied to overcome the impact of the considerable variation in the values of obesity attributes involving outliers and skewed distribution.Overall, 447 subjects were categorized into six clusters; metabolically normal, mild, and severe categories. There were clearly separated metabolically normal Cluster 1 and severe Cluster 2, as well as intermediate Cluster 3, 4, and 5 that had profiles of fewer attributes with abnormal values. Cluster 3 was characteristic of sole hypertension. Cluster 3 and 4 exhibited contrasting HDL-C and LDL-C levels despite similarly elevated total cholesterol. Cluster 6 with slightly elevated triglyceride was closest to the normal group. Four- and 10-quantile-transformations yielded consistent clustering results. Compared with the original data, the quantile-transformed data produced more regular and spherical clusters and evenly distributed clusters in terms of object numbers.This big data analysis strategy makes use of quantile-transformation of data to overcome the issue of outliers and the irregular distribution and applies to the analysis of other non-communicable diseases.© 2019 Li et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693697>Testosterone supplementation improves insulin responsiveness in HFD fed male T2DM mice and potentiates insulin signaling in the skeletal muscle and C2C12 myocyte cell line.</a></h2><p>Type 2  (T2DM) is characterised by hyperglycemia due to the incidence of insulin resistance. Testosterone supplementation has been shown to have a positive co-relation with improved glycemic control in T2DM males. Clinical studies have reported that Androgen Replacement Therapy (ART) to hypogonadic males with T2DM resulted in improved glycemic control and metabolic parameters, but, these studies did not address in detail how testosterone acted on the key glucose homeostatic organs.In this study, we delineate the effect of testosterone supplementation to high-fat diet (HFD) induced T2DM in male C57BL6J mice and the effect of testosterone supplementation on the skeletal muscle insulin responsiveness. We also studied the effect of testosterone on the insulin signaling pathway proteins in C2C12 myocyte cells to validate the in vivo findings.We found that testosterone had a potentiating effect on the skeletal muscle insulin signaling pathway to improve glycaemic control. We demonstrate that, in males, testosterone improves skeletal muscle insulin responsiveness by potentiating the PI3K-AKT pathway. The testosterone treated animals showed significant increase in the skeletal muscle Insulin Receptor (IR), p85 subunit of PI3K, P-GSK3α (Ser-21), and P-AKT (Ser-473) levels as compared to the control animals; but there was no significant change in total AKT and GSK3α. Testosterone supplementation inhibited GSK3α in the myocytes in a PI3K/AKT pathway dependent manner; on the other hand GSK3β gene expression was reduced in the skeletal muscle upon testosterone supplementation.Testosterone increases insulin responsiveness by potentiating insulin signaling in the skeletal muscle cells, which is in contrast to the increased insulin resistance in the liver of testosterone treated T2DM male animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692364>Altered immune system in offspring of rat maternal vertical sleeve gastrectomy.</a></h2><p>Obesity in women results in reduced fertility and increased complications during pregnancy. Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) effectively reduces weight, type-2  and dyslipidemia, but is also associated with preterm and small-for-gestational age births. The mechanism by which VSG impacts fetal development remains unknown. Here we hypothesize that previously reported immune changes during rat VSG pregnancy are reflected long-term in the immune system of the offspring. Offspring of VSG and Sham dams were evaluated at postnatal day (PND) 21 and PND60. At PND21, VSG pups have lower numbers of circulating B lymphocytes compared to Sham pups (P<0.05) and have lower transcription of lymphocyte marker  (P<0.01) in the spleen, while other lymphocyte populations measured are not different. Total plasma IgG is higher (P<0.01) and C reactive protein is lower (P<0.05) in VSG offspring compared to Sham offspring at PND21. The central nervous system of VSG pups is also affected at PND21, having higher expression of  mRNA (P<0.05) and higher immunoreactivity of microglia marker, IBA1, in the hypothalamus. At PND60, the immune-hematologic differences are not present, however, mRNA expression of  is elevated (P<0.001) in the spleen of VSG offspring along with markers of T cells. These data suggest that the immune system of VSG offspring is compromised early in life, but rebounds after weaning and may even become hyperactive. Future work is needed to determine if the immune system of VSG offspring is capable of mounting a proper defense and if other aspects of development are affected.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697208>Reply to Letter to the Editor: "No insulating effect of obesity, neither in mice nor in humans".</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696670>Physical activity, sedentary time and cardiometabolic health indicators among Mexican children.</a></h2><p>We examined the independent associations of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time (ST) with cardiometabolic indicators in Mexican children (4-6 years of age). We conducted a cross-sectional study (n = 400) using the measures of MVPA and ST (7-day accelerometry) and the following indicators: % body fat, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI) z-score, glycated haemoglobin, blood glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, leptin, adiponectin and resting blood pressure. We examined the independent associations of MVPA and ST with cardiometabolic indicators through confounder-adjusted and mutually adjusted (including both MVPA and ST) linear regression models. Confounder-adjusted models showed that MVPA was associated with higher BMI z-scores and lower adiponectin levels in girls and lower body fat among boys. ST was associated with higher body fat, in the full sample, and lower LDL cholesterol among boys. After mutually adjusting for MVPA and ST, MVPA (10-minute increase) remained significantly associated with BMI z-score in girls (β = 0.187, 95% CI: 0.019, 0.356) and ST (60-minute increase) remained significantly associated with higher body fat (β = 1.11%, 95% CI: 0.019, 2.203) among boys and higher glycated haemoglobin (β = 0.047% points, 95% CI: 0.000, 0.094) in the full sample. In preschool-aged children, the objective measures of ST and MVPA were associated with small differences in cardiometabolic health indicators. ST was unfavourably associated with some cardiometabolic indicators even after adjusting for MVPA, and thus appeared to have a more significant role than MVPA, especially in boys.

The trajectories of  care-seeking behaviours among newly diagnosed  patients with regular follow-up were identified using a group-based trajectory model from 2000 to 2004. Severe  complications were assessed for the period 2005-2010. Cox-proportional hazard method with a cumulative incidence function was applied.Among the  patients with regular follow-up during the first 5 years since diagnosis, 44.5% and 40.6% were persistently cared for in generalized care settings and specialized settings, respectively. Only 14.9% of them had shifted between different levels of care setting during the first 5 years. No significant difference in adverse outcomes was observed between patients who were persistently treated in generalized and specialized care settings. Significantly worse outcomes were observed among patients who shifted from generalized care settings to specialized settings (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5, 6.8). In contrast, among the elderly, regular users of generalized care providers had a higher hazard of adverse outcomes than those of specialized care providers (aHR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.0, 10.7). patients who were persistently treated in generalized care settings had health outcomes comparable to those who were persistently treated in specialized care settings.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) and primary hyperparathyroidism can occur simultaneously.Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of hyperparathyroidism in PA.We performed a case finding of primary hyperparathyroidism in a retrospective series of 503 patients with PA (cohort 1). We analysed primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism in 141 prospective PA patients who underwent PTH, serum calcium and phosphate measurements at time of diagnosis of PA (cohort 2).The prevalence for primary hyperparathyroidism was 1.2% in cohort 1, and 2.1% in cohort 2. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was found in 54.6% of the patients. Patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism had significantly higher aldosterone and lower potassium levels and took more antihypertensive medications compared to those with normal PTH levels. In multivariate analysis, aldosterone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly correlated with serum PTH levels. There was a nonsignificant trend to a higher cardiovascular morbidity in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Patients with aldosterone producing adenoma had significantly higher PTH levels compared to patients with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. After treatment, there was a significant decrease of PTH levels in both groups.Patients with PA frequently have primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is alleviated by correction of PA by surgical or medical means.

The aim of this study was to investigate the sensitivity of human platelets to the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system in patients with poorly controlled type 2  (DM2). Ligand binding was analyzed using I-labelled IGF-1 and insulin, and relative expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and insulin receptor (IR) was evaluated by Western blotting. Platelet aggregation in the presence of IGF-1 was studied by the plate aggregometry assay. We found that platelets from DM2 patients exhibited significantly higher IGF-1 binding and upregulation of IGF-1R expression in comparison with healthy individuals. Both insulin binding and IR expression were lower in the DM2 group, but the differences with the healthy control were statistically insignificant. The potentiating effect of IGF-1 on the thrombin-induced activation of platelets was detected in both groups but was significantly more pronounced in the DM2 patients. The initial rate of platelet activation in the presence of IGF-1 positively correlated with the concentration of glycated hemoglobin. Platelets isolated from DM2 patients displayed elevated expression of the IGF-1R subunits, which might have contributed to the higher sensitivity of these cells to IGF-1 in thrombin-initiated aggregation by increasing the rate of platelet activation.

Here, we show that old as compared to young antiviral CD8+TM more effectively harness disparate molecular processes (cytokine signaling, trafficking, effector functions, and co-stimulation/inhibition) that in concert confer greater secondary reactivity. The relative reliance on these pathways is contingent on the nature of the secondary challenge (greater for chronic than acute viral infections) and over time, aging CD8+TM re-establish a dependence on the same accessory signals required for effective priming of naïve CD8+T cells in the first place. Thus, our findings reveal a temporal regulation of complementary recall response determinants that is consistent with the recently proposed "rebound model" according to which aging CD8+TM properties are gradually aligned with those of naïve CD8+T cells; our identification of a broadly diversified collection of immunomodulatory targets may further provide a foundation for the potential therapeutic "tuning" of CD8+TM immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693551>Stress and Health in Nursing Students: The Nurse Engagement and Wellness Study.</a></h2><p>Evidence suggests that behavioral, social, and environmental factors may modify the effects of life stress on health and performance of new nurses as they transition to hospitals.The aim of this study was to describe the methods of a project designed to investigate the role of social, behavioral, and environmental factors in modifying the adverse effects of stress on new nurses and to discuss demographic, health, and life stress characteristics of the cohort at baseline.A prospective cohort design was used to conduct a comprehensive assessment of health endpoints, life stress, behaviors, personal traits, social factors, indicators of engagement and performance, and environmental exposures in nursing students. Adjusted odds ratios and analyses of covariance were used to examine associations between these factors at baseline.Health indicators in the cohort were comparable or better than in the broader United States population, and lifetime stress exposure was lower than among students from other majors.

Conversely, better social, environmental, behavioral, and personal profiles were associated with protective effects for the same health conditions.These data comprehensively summarize the lives of predominately Hispanic nursing students and highlight risk and resilience factors associated with their health and well-being. The findings are timely, as the nursing field diversifies in preparation to care for a diverse and aging population.

For each metformin user, a propensity-score matched metformin nonuser and an age- and sex-matched healthy TB close contact were selected. The outcome was incident TB, identified using previously validated diagnostic criteria. Independent predictors were investigated using stratified Cox regression analysis. Interaction analysis was also performed.A total of 5846 TB close contacts who were metformin users, metformin non-users, and healthy contacts were analysed. The incidence of active TB was 755 (600-938), 1117 (927-1335), and 526 (393-689) cases per 100,000 person-years in each group, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that healthy contacts had the lowest risk of developing active TB (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.42 [0.30-0.60]) and metformin use partially reversed the risk associated with DM (aHR: 0.73 [0.54-0.98]). Subpopulation analysis revealed a significant interaction between insulin use and metformin use.Metformin use is associated with a lower risk of developing active TB among TB close contacts with DM, especially for insulin users.

Shortly before 2000, researchers began describing metabolically active adipose tissue on cancer-surveillance F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in adult humans. This tissue generates heat through mitochondrial uncoupling and functions similar to classical brown and beige adipose tissue in mice. Despite extensive research, human brown/beige fat's role in resistance to obesity in humans has not yet been fully delineated. FDG uptake is the de facto gold standard imaging technique when studying brown adipose tissue, although it has not been rigorously compared to other techniques. We, therefore, present a concise review of established and emerging methods to image brown adipose tissue activity in humans. Reviewed modalities include anatomic imaging with CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); molecular imaging with FDG, fatty acids, and acetate; and emerging techniques. FDG-PET/CT is the most commonly used modality because of its widespread use in cancer imaging, but there are mechanistic reasons to believe other radiotracers may be more sensitive and accurate at detecting brown adipose tissue activity. Radiation-free modalities may help the longitudinal study of brown adipose tissue activity in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693784>Structural Insights into Melatonin Receptors.</a></h2><p>The long-anticipated high-resolution structures of the human melatonin G protein-coupled receptors MT and MT , involved in establishing and maintaining circadian rhythm, were obtained in complex with two melatonin analogs and two approved anti-insomnia and anti-depression drugs using X-ray free electron laser serial femtosecond crystallography. The structures shed light on the overall conformation and unusual structural features of melatonin receptors, as well as their ligand binding sites and the melatonergic pharmacophore, thereby providing insights into receptor subtype selectivity. The structures revealed an occluded orthosteric ligand binding site with a membrane-buried channel for ligand entry in both receptors, and an additional putative ligand entry path in MT from the extracellular side. This unexpected ligand entry mode contributes to facilitating the high specificity with which melatonin receptors bind their cognate ligand and exclude structurally similar molecules such as serotonin, the biosynthetic precursor of melatonin. Finally, the MT structure allowed accurate mapping of type 2 -related single-nucleotide polymorphisms, where a clustering of residues in helices I and II on the protein-membrane interface was observed which could potentially influence receptor oligomerization. The role of receptor oligomerization is further discussed in light of the differential interaction of MT and MT with GPR50, a regulatory melatonin co-receptor. The melatonin receptor structures will facilitate design of selective tool compounds to further dissect the specific physiological function of each receptor subtype as well as provide a structural basis for next generation sleeping aids and other drugs targeting these receptors with higher specificity and fewer side effects.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696603>A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study of a Fixed-Dose Combination of Phentermine/Topiramate in Adolescents with Obesity.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of VI-0521, a fixed-dose combination of immediate-release phentermine (PHEN) and extended-release (ER) topiramate (TPM) in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age with obesity. Weight loss and adverse events using this drug combination are also reported.This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-design, placebo-controlled study in adolescents with obesity. 42 adolescents were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to placebo, mid-dose (PHEN/TPM 7.5 mg/46 mg), or top-dose (PHEN/TPM 15 mg/92 mg) of VI-0521. A total of 26 adolescents were included in the PK analysis (14 from the mid-dose group and 12 from the top-dose group).At Day 56, arithmetic means of terminal elimination half-life (T ), apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (Vc/F) were consistent across dose levels for both PHEN and TPM. Arithmetic means of CL/F and Vc/F for PHEN and TPM administered as a combination in adolescents with obesity were within 10%-30% of those previously assessed in adults with obesity enrolled in Phase II and III studies. A higher proportion of adolescents in both the mid- and top-dose groups (13.3% and 50.0%, respectively) compared with placebo (0.0%) reached ≥5% weight loss at Day 56. The least square (LS) mean change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to Week 56 was -5.2 mmHg for the placebo group, -2.5 mmHg for the mid-dose group, and -5.5 mmHg for the top-dose group. The LS mean change in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline to Day 56 was -2.4 mmHg for the placebo group, +3.8 mmHg for the mid-dose group, and +2.0 mmHg for the top-dose group. Participants in the top-dose group had increases in heart rate from baseline of 4.1 bpm while participants in the mid-dose group experienced a mean decrease in heart rate of 4.5 bpm at Day 56. Both PHEN/TPM dose combinations were safe and well tolerated.Treatment of adolescents with obesity using a fixed-dose combination of phentermine/topiramate for 8 weeks resulted in exposure to PHEN and TPM that was comparable to that observed in adults, statistically significant weight loss, and a tolerable safety profile.

When projected on the first factorial plane (~ 60% of the total inertia), Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen tended to be in opposite directions regarding both socioeconomic and health factors. In the respective multivariate analyses of the two candidates, both socio-economic and health variables were significantly associated with voting patterns, with wealthier and healthier departments more likely to vote for Emmanuel Macron, and opposite departments more likely to vote for Marine Le Pen. Mortality (p = 0.03), severe chronic conditions (p = 0.014), and  (p < 0.0001) were among the strongest predictors of voting pattern for Marine Le Pen.

Metabolic factors are associated with NCI, but their relationships to cluster-derived NCI profiles are unknown.Participants (144 PLWH and 102 HIV uninfected) aged 50+ years completed a neuropsychological battery assessing seven cognitive domains. Latent class analysis (LCA) identified NCI profiles separately by HIV serostatus and in a combined sample. Obtained classes were examined against the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and diagnoses of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Multinomial regression identified metabolic predictors of classification.LCA identified three latent classes in each participant sample: Class1Multidomain NCI (high probability of impairment across multiple domains), Class 2Learning & Recall NCI (high probability of impairment in learning and recall), and Class 3NC Unimpaired (low probability of NCI across all domains). Severity of NCI implied by classes corresponded with MoCA scores and HAND diagnoses. In analyses on the combined sample, compared to HIV-uninfected individuals, PLWH were more likely to be in Class1Multidomain NCI. Among PLWH, those with dyslipidemia and hypertension had greater odds of classification in Class 1Multidomain NCI while those with central obesity had higher odds of classification in Class 2Learning & Recall NCI; metabolic syndrome approached significance as a differential predictor. Regardless of HIV status, individuals with  were more likely to be in Class 1Multidomain NCI.Metabolic risk factors confer heightened risk of NCI in HIV infection. Interventions to reduce metabolic risk may improve neurocognitive outcomes among PLWH.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Cross-linking of glycation products to proteins results in the formation of cross-linked proteins that inhibit the normal functioning of the cell. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are risk molecules for the cell aging process. These ends products are increasingly synthesized in  and are essentially responsible for diabetic complications. They accumulate in the extracellular matrix and bind to receptors (receptor of AGE [RAGE]) to generate oxidative stress and inflammation. particularly in the cardiovascular system. Treatment methods targeting the AGE system may be of clinical importance in reducing and preventing the complications induced by AGEs in  and old age. The AGE cross-link breaker alagebrium (a thiazolium derivative) is the most studied anti-AGE compound in the clinical field. Phase III clinical studies with alagebrium have been successfully conducted, and this molecule has positive effects on cardiovascular hypertrophy, , hypertension, vascular sclerotic pathologies, and similar processes. However, the mechanism is still not fully understood. The primary mechanism is that alagebrium removes newly formed AGEs by chemically separating α-dicarbonyl carbon-carbon bonds formed in cross-linked structures. However, it is also reported that alagebrium is a methylglyoxal effective inhibitor. It is not yet clear whether alagebrium inhibits copper-catalyzed ascorbic acid oxidation through metal chelation or destruction of the AGEs. It is not known whether alagebrium has a direct association with RAGEs. The safety profile is favorably in humans, and studies have been terminated due to financial insufficiency and inability to license as a drug.©Copyright 2019 by the Atatürk University School of Medicine - Available online at www.eurasianjmed.com.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691541>Longitudinal trajectories of BMI z-score: an international comparison of 11,513 Australian, American and German/Austrian/Luxembourgian youth with type 1 .</a></h2><p>BMI fluctuations during puberty are common.

The analysis included 11,513 youth with type 1 , duration >1 year, at least one BMI measure at baseline (age 8-10 years) and >5 aggregated BMI measures by year of age during follow-up until age 17 years. BMIz was calculated based on WHO charts. Latent class growth modelling was used to identify subgroups following a similar trajectory of BMIz over time.Five distinct trajectories of BMIz were present in the T1DX and ADDN cohorts, while six trajectories were identified in the DPV cohort. Boys followed more often a low/near-normal pattern while elevated BMIz curves were more likely in girls (ADDN; DPV). For T1DX cohort, no sex differences were observed. Comparing the reference group (BMIz ~0) with the other groups during puberty, higher BMIz was significantly associated with older age at T1D onset, racial/ethnic minority and elevated HbA1c (all p<0.05).This multinational study presents unique BMIz trajectories in youth with T1D across three continents.

Therefore, reducing adverse childhood experiences is critical to avoiding multiple negative health and socioeconomic outcomes in adulthood.Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data were collected from 25 states that included state-added adverse childhood experience items during 2015-2017. Outcomes were self-reported status for coronary heart disease, stroke, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer (excluding skin cancer), kidney disease, , depression, overweight or obesity, current smoking, heavy drinking, less than high school completion, unemployment, and lack of health insurance. Logistic regression modeling adjusting for age group, race/ethnicity, and sex was used to calculate population attributable fractions representing the potential reduction in outcomes associated with preventing adverse childhood experiences.Nearly one in six adults in the study population (15.6%) reported four or more types of adverse childhood experiences. Adverse childhood experiences were significantly associated with poorer health outcomes, health risk behaviors, and socioeconomic challenges. Potential percentage reductions in the number of observed cases as indicated by population attributable fractions ranged from 1.7% for overweight or obesity to 23.9% for heavy drinking, 27.0% for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 44.1% for depression.Efforts that prevent adverse childhood experiences could also potentially prevent adult chronic conditions, depression, health risk behaviors, and negative socioeconomic outcomes. States can use comprehensive public health approaches derived from the best available evidence to prevent childhood adversity before it begins. By creating the conditions for healthy communities and focusing on primary prevention, it is possible to reduce risk for adverse childhood experiences while also mitigating consequences for those already affected by these experiences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695055>Differential effects of D-cycloserine and amantadine on motor behavior and D receptor binding in the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic system of the adult rat.</a></h2><p>D-cycloserine (DCS) and amantadine (AMA) act as partial NMDA receptor (R) agonist and antagonist, respectively. In the present study, we compared the effects of DCS and AMA on dopamine DR binding in the brain of adult rats in relation to motor behavior. DR binding was determined with small animal SPECT in baseline and after challenge with DCS (20 mg/kg) or AMA (40 mg/kg) with [I]IBZM as radioligand. Immediately post-challenge, motor/exploratory behavior was assessed for 30 min in an open field. The regional binding potentials (ratios of the specifically bound compartments to the cerebellar reference region) were computed in baseline and post-challenge. DCS increased DR binding in nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area, thalamus, frontal, motor and parietal cortex as well as anterodorsal and posterior hippocampus, whereas AMA decreased DR binding in nucleus accumbens, caudateputamen and thalamus. After DCS, ambulation and head-shoulder motility were decreased, while sitting was increased compared to vehicle and AMA. Moreover, DCS increased rearing relative to AMA. The regional elevations of DR binding after DCS reflect a reduction of available dopamine throughout the mesolimbocortical system. In contrast, the reductions of DR binding after AMA indicate increased dopamine in nucleus accumbens, caudateputamen and thalamus. Findings imply that, after DCS, nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine levels are directly related to motor/exploratory activity, whereas an inverse relationship may be inferred for AMA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695914>Associations between self-reported , disordered eating behaviours, weight/shape overvaluation, and health-related quality of life.</a></h2><p>Eating disorders (ED) and disordered eating behaviours (DEB) have been found to be common in people with  (DM). However, findings have been inconsistent.This study investigated the association between self-reported  (Type 1 or 2) with ED/DEB (binge eating, subjective binge eating or loss of control overeating, severe dieting and purging) weight/shape overvaluation, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a household survey in South Australia.In 2017 2977 people aged ≥15 years, who were representative of the general population, were interviewed. Participants reported their gender, age, household income, highest educational attainment, area of residence, presence of DM, ED/DEB, level of overvaluation, current HRQoL and height and weight. For the analyses between ED/DEB, self-reported DM and HRQoL, a grouping variable was created: 1) people without ED/DEB or self-reported DM; 2) people without ED/DEB and with self-reported DM; 3) people with ED/DEB and without self-reported DM; and 4) people with ED/DEB and self-reported DM. Analyses were stratified by sex and age group.Subjective binge eating prevalence was higher in people with self-reported DM (6.6% vs 2.8%,  = 0.016), and overvaluation was lower in those with DM (36% vs 43.8%,  = 0.007). In analyses stratified by sex and age group, subjective binge eating was higher in women and in people over 45 years with self-reported DM and overvaluation was lower in men and in people over 45 years with self-reported DM. However, these differences were not significant on tests of gender and age interaction. People in both DM groups scored significantly lower than people without DM groups on physical HRQoL. In contrast, people in both ED/DEB groups scored lower than people without ED/BEB on mental HRQoL.People with self-reported DM had a higher prevalence of subjective binge eating, a lower prevalence of overvaluation and there were no significant effects of age or gender. Furthermore, participants with self-reported DM and comorbid ED or DEB had impairments of both mental and physical HRQoL. Assessing an individual's sense of control over eating along with other DEB is likely important for identification of these mental health problems.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696762>Five-Year Outcomes in Patients With  Treated With Biodegradable Polymer Sirolimus-Eluting Stents Versus Durable Polymer Everolimus-Eluting Stents.</a></h2><p>Background The choice of optimal drug-eluting stent therapy for patients with  (DM) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention remains uncertain. We aimed to assess the long-term clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention with biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stents (BP-SES) versus durable polymer everolimus-eluting stents (DP-EES) in patients with DM. Methods and Results In a prespecified subgroup analysis of the BIOSCIENCE (Ultrathin Strut Biodegradable Polymer Sirolimus-Eluting Stent Versus Durable Polymer Everolimus-Eluting Stent for Percutaneous Coronary Revascularization) trial (), patients randomly assigned to ultrathin-strut BP-SES or thin-strut DP-EES were stratified according to diabetic status. The primary end point was target lesion failure, a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and clinically indicated target lesion revascularization, at 5 years. Among 2119 patients, 486 (22.9%) presented with DM. Compared with individuals without DM, patients with DM were older and had a greater baseline cardiac risk profile. In patients with DM, target lesion failure at 5 years occurred in 74 patients (cumulative incidence, 31.0%) treated with BP-SES and 57 patients (25.8%) treated with DP-EES (risk ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.87-1.73 [=0.24]). In individuals without DM, target lesion failure at 5 years occurred in 124 patients (16.8%) treated with BP-SES and 132 patients (16.8%) treated with DP-EES (risk ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.77-1.26 [=0.90;  for interaction=0.31]). Cumulative 5-year incidence rates of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, clinically indicated target lesion revascularization, and definite stent thrombosis were similar among patients with DM treated with BP-SES or DP-EES. There was no interaction between diabetic status and treatment effect of BP-SES versus DP-EES. Conclusions In a prespecified subgroup analysis of the BIOSCIENCE trial, we found no difference in clinical outcomes throughout 5 years between patients with DM treated with ultrathin-strut BP-SES or thin-strut DP-EES.

Increasing evidence indicates that periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis) has an adverse effect on glycemic control and participates in the pathophysiology of complications related to type 2 . Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the influence of obesity on clinical periodontal parameters of patients with type 2  with stage II or III periodontitis grade C after conventional periodontal treatment.For this study, 36 patients, aged 25 to 65 years, were evaluated; 20 patients with type 2  and moderate to severe periodontitis (Non-Obese Group) and 16 patients with type 2  with obesity and moderate to severe periodontitis (Obese Group). These patients underwent conventional periodontal treatment and were evaluated using plaque index, probing depth, clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing and gingival crevicular fluid analysis, as well as laboratory tests of glycated hemoglobin, fasting glycemia, total cholesterol, and fractions of triglycerides. Periodontal and laboratory parameters were evaluated at baselineand six months.The results showed improvements in periodontal and clinical laboratory parameters(p less than 0.05) in the evaluated periods; however, the non-obese group presented significantly better results when compared to the obese group.It can be concluded that the presence of obesity may hinder the improvement of periodontal clinical parameters after conventional periodontal treatment in patients with  and periodontitis.Copyright© by the International Academy of Periodontology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698377>Pregnancy Prolongation After Eculizumab Use in Early-Onset Preeclampsia.</a></h2><p>Untreated microangiopathic hemolytic anemia in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.

If not already included, each case was scored based on RegiSCAR criteria. Only "probable" or "definite" cases of DRESS were included in the analysis, totaling 130 cases.In the pediatric population, the average age of diagnosis for DRESS was 8.7 years old. The most common causative drugs include antiepileptics (50%) and antibiotics (30.8%). Time from drug exposure to DRESS presentation averaged 23.8 days. Common clinical symptoms include rash (99.2%) (typically morbilliform (89.2%)), fever (96.2%), eosinophilia (90%), and lymphadenopathy (74.6%). Human herpesvirus-6 reactivation was observed in 16.1% of cases. The most commonly affected internal organ was the liver (80%), followed by the spleen (21.5%) and kidney (15.4%). Management strategies involved, either alone or in combination, included corticosteroids (intravenous 60.8% and oral 41.5%), intravenous immunoglobulins (12.3%), plasmapheresis (2.3%), and ganciclovir (1.5%).

This includes increasing expenditures for medicines, although these increases when expressed as a share of overall societal wealth are more moderate than often claimed. An increasing use of generic medicines (currently about 90% of all prescriptions) means that costs for discovery and development of innovative drugs must be recovered on a shrinking percentage of prescriptions. However, the key challenge to affordable drugs is exponentially increasing costs to bring a new medicine to the market, which in turn are largely driven by an about 90% attrition rate after start of clinical development. While many factors will be required in concert to keep innovative medicines affordable, reducing attrition appears to be the factor with the greatest potential to contain escalating drug development costs and thereby medication expenditures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696836>Efficacy and safety of low-intensity shockwave therapy plus tadalafil 5 mg once daily in men with type 2  and erectile dysfunction: a matched-pair comparison study.</a></h2><p>Low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy (LiESWT) represents a promising treatment for patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). We investigated the efficacy of LiESWT combined with tadalafil 5 mg once daily in men with type 2  (T2DM) and ED and compared LiESWT protocols administering different number of shockwaves. We performed a retrospective matched-pair comparison using data from a prospectively maintained database. Seventy-eight patients who received tadalafil 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks + LiESWT performed with an electrohydraulic source for 3 weeks (Group A) were matched 1:1 to patients who received tadalafil 5 mg once daily alone for 12 weeks (Group B). A subgroup analysis was performed according to the number of shockwaves delivered during each session (1500, 1800, and 2400 in subgroup A1, A2, and A3, respectively). The mean International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) score variations with respect to baseline recorded at 4, 12, and 24 weeks after the end of the treatment were investigated as treatment outcomes. The mean IIEF-5 scores significantly improved in all groups and subgroups at 4-week follow-up without intergroup differences. At 12- and 24-week follow-up, the mean IIEF-5 improvement was significantly higher among patients in the A3 subgroup (+5.0 ± 2.1 [P < 0.001] and +4.7 ± 2.3 [P < 0.001], respectively). The combined approach with tadalafil 5 mg once daily and LiESWT with a protocol involving 2400 shockwaves provides significant advantages in terms of IIEF-5 improvement and durability compared to tadalafil 5 mg once daily alone in patients with T2DM and ED.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694774>Efficacy and safety of metformin and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in adults with type1 : A systematic review and network meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>To compare the efficacy and safety of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and metformin in adults with type1  (T1DM).Randomized clinical trials until February 2019, designed to assess the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors/metformin in adults with T1DM, were searched on PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science.

Demographic characteristics, clinical features, and medical history were collected by trained researchers. T1DM as a whole was comprised of classic T1DM and LADA. Classic T1DM was identified based on the clinical phenotype of insulin-dependency, and LADA was differentiated from patients with initially an undefined  type with standardized glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody testing at the core laboratory. The age and sex distributions from a large national survey of  in China conducted in 2010 were used to standardize the prevalence of classic T1DM and LADA.Among 17,349 adult patients, the prevalence of T1DM was 5.49% (95% CI: 4.90-6.08%) (5.14% [95% CI: 4.36-5.92%] in males and 6.16% [95% CI: 5.30-7.02%] in females), with 65% of these having LADA. The prevalence of classic T1DM decreased with increasing age (<0.05), while that of LADA was stable (>0.05). The prevalence of T1DM in overweight or obese patients was 3.42% (95% CI: 3.20-3.64%) and 2.42% (95% CI: 1.83-3.01%), respectively, and LADA accounted for 76.5% and 79.2% in these two groups.We draw the conclusion that T1DM, especially LADA, was prevalent in newly diagnosed adult-onset  in China, which highlights the importance of routine islet autoantibodies testing in clinical practice.© 2019 Tang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696956> and gender have a negative impact on the outcome of hip fracture surgery - a pilot study.</a></h2><p> (DM) is associated with an elevated risk of post-operative complications. The impact it has on patients living with DM following hip fracture surgery (HFS) is not completely understood, and may represent a predictor of increased mortality. This study investigates the impact of DM, gender, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade and fracture location, on outcome of HFS in Ireland. The Hospital Inpatient Enquiry (HIPE) database records all fragility hip fractures within Galway University Hospital. Retrospective data collection was performed over a three-year period. Data collected included patient age, gender, date of HFS, anatomical fracture location, type of operation, ASA grade, DM status and mortality. A database of 650 individuals was created including 461 females and 189 males, with an average group age of 80.2±9.3 years. Results showed a significantly higher incidence of hip fractures in males with DM (19.57%) than females with DM (12.36%) (χ test, p = 0.020). Cox regression survival analysis indicated that DM status and ASA grade were the two main independent predictors of patient survival following HFS. Nevertheless, when examining the combined impact of gender and DM status on survival after HFS, results showed that survival post HFS differed significantly with gender and presence of DM (log-rank test, p < 0.001), with males with DM performing worse than females with DM (p=0.021) or males without DM (p=0.001). This gender and disease-associated outcome should prompt early multi-disciplinary team approach to the management of hip fractures in patients with DM. This article is protected by copyright.

The primary endpoint was change in HbA . Secondary endpoints included change in insulin dose, CSII settings, glycaemic variability, body weight and patient-reported outcome-measures. Finally, adverse effects including hypoglycaemic events were registered.HbA1c was reduced by 5 mmol/mol (0.5%) from a baseline of 66 mmol/mol (8.2%) in patients treated with liraglutide compared with a non-significant change of +2.3 mmol/mol (0.2%) from a baseline of 66 mmol/mol (8.1%) in patients treated with placebo, (between-group difference 7 mmol/mol (0.7%), P<0.001). Liraglutide reduced total insulin dose by 8 units/day or 16% of total insulin dose (P=0.008). Mean body weight was reduced by 6.3 kg (P<0.001) compared to placebo. Concomitantly, time spent in glycaemic target range 4-10 mmol/L (71-180 mg/dL) increased while the risk of hypoglycaemia did not differ between groups at end of treatment.Liraglutide treatment reduced HbA , total daily insulin dose and body weight without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia in CSII-treated patients with type 1  and insufficient glycaemic control.

The small-molecule fluorescent probe could help us locate GPR120 visually and guide in-depth study of GPR120. In this study, we synthesized six nonacidic sulfonamide fluorescent probes and tested their optical and biological properties. Compared to previous probes for GPR120, these probes, with sulfonamide structure, have high selectivity on GPR120.

While there have been many studies reporting successful algorithms for predicting nocturnal hypoglycemia, predicting postprandial hypoglycemia still remains a challenge due to extreme glucose fluctuations that occur around mealtimes. The goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of easy-to-use, computationally efficient machine-learning algorithm to predict postprandial hypoglycemia with a unique feature set.We use retrospective CGM datasets of 104 people who had experienced at least one hypoglycemia alert value during a three-day CGM session. The algorithms were developed based on four machine learning models with a unique data-driven feature set: a random forest (RF), a support vector machine using a linear function or a radial basis function, a K-nearest neighbor, and a logistic regression. With 5-fold cross-subject validation, the average performance of each model was calculated to compare and contrast their individual performance. The area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the F1 score were used as the main criterion for evaluating the performance.In predicting a hypoglycemia alert value with a 30-min prediction horizon, the RF model showed the best performance with the average AUC of 0.966, the average sensitivity of 89.6%, the average specificity of 91.3%, and the average F1 score of 0.543. In addition, the RF showed the better predictive performance for postprandial hypoglycemic events than other models.In conclusion, we showed that machine-learning algorithms have potential in predicting postprandial hypoglycemia, and the RF model could be a better candidate for the further development of postprandial hypoglycemia prediction algorithm to advance the CGM technology and the AP technology further.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695251>Molecular and Pathological Events Involved in the Pathogenesis of -Associated Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p> is a rising epidemic in most part of the world and is often associated with multiple organ disorders such as kidney, liver, and cardiovascular diseases.

In addition to triggering insulin secretion, glucose-induced signal regulates β-cell proliferation and survival. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of glucose on the β-cell functionality still remains unclear. Glucokinase, a hexokinase isozyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose, acts as the glucose sensor in the β-cells. To investigate the mechanisms of glucose signaling in the regulation of β-cell functions, we analyzed the role of glucokinase in insulin secretion, β-cell proliferation and β-cell apoptosis, using β-cell-specific glucokinase-haploinsufficient (Gck+/-) mice and allosteric glucokinase activators (GKAs). Glucokinase-mediated glucose metabolism (1) suppresses endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced β-cell apoptosis via inducing insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) expression and expression of ER stress-related molecules, (2) promotes adaptive β-cell proliferation through activation of the Forkhead Box M1 (FoxM1)/polo-like kinase-1 (PLK1)/centromere protein-A (CENP-A) pathway, (3) induces islet inflammation by promoting interaction of islet-derived S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8) with macrophages, (4) induces the expression of Fibulin-5 (Fbln5), an extracellular matrix protein to regulate β-cell functions, and (5) activates other unknown pathways. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have been found to possibly compensate for dysregulation of glucose metabolism in the β-cells. This review provides an update and overview of the recent advances in the study of β-cell pathophysiology and some therapeutic possibilities focusing on glucose-/glucokinase-mediated signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695457>The effect of A1 adenosine receptor in diabetic megalin loss with caspase-1/IL18 signaling.</a></h2><p>In our previous study, exacerbation of albuminuria was observed in A1 adenosine receptor knockout (A1AR) mice with diabetic nephropathy (DN), but the mechanism was unclear. Here, we investigated the relationship of megalin loss and albuminuria, to identify the protective effect of A1AR in megalin loss associated albuminuria by inhibiting pyroptosis-related caspase-1/IL-18 signaling of DN.We successfully collected DN patients' samples and built  mice models induced by streptozotocin. Megalin, cubilin, and A1AR expression were detected in kidney tissue samples from DN patients and mice through immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining. A1AR, caspase-1, interleukin-18 (IL-18) expression were analyzed using Western blotting in wild-type and   mice. Human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTC) were cultured with high glucose to observe the effect of A1AR agonist and antagonist on caspase-1/IL-18 and megalin injury.The loss of megalin, co-localized with A1AR at PTC, was associated with the level of albuminuria in diabetic patients and mice. The injury of megalin-cubilin was accompanied with the A1AR upregulation (1.30±0.1 vs 0.98±0.2, 0.042), the caspase-1 (1.33±0.1 vs 1.0±0.2, 0.036), and IL-18 (1.26±0.2 vs 0.96±0.2, 0.026) signaling activation in mice with DN. More severe pathological injury, 24 hrs urine albumin excretion (170.8±4.1 μg/d vs 132.0±2.9 μg/d vs 17.9±2.8 μg/d, 0.001) and megalin-cubilin loss were observed in   DN mice with more pronounced caspase-1 (1.52±0.03 vs 1.20±0.01, 0.017) and IL-18 (1.42±0.02 vs 1.21±0.02, 0.018) secretion. High glucose could stimulate the secretion of caspase-1 (1.72 times, 0.01) and IL-18 (1.64 times, 0.01), which was abolished by A1AR agonist and aggravated by A1AR antagonist.A1AR played a protective role in proximal tubular megalin loss associated albuminuria by inhibiting the pyroptosis-related caspase-1/IL-18 signaling in DN.© 2019 Tian et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691802>Methylation changes in the peripheral blood of filipinos with type 2  suggest spurious transcription initiation at TXNIP.</a></h2><p>While much work has been done in associating differentially methylated positions (DMPs) to type 2  (T2D) across different populations, not much attention has been placed on identifying its possible functional consequences. We explored methylation changes in the peripheral blood of Filipinos with T2D and identified 177 associated DMPs. Most of these DMPs were associated with genes involved in metabolism, inflammation and the cell cycle. Three of these DMPs map to the TXNIP gene body, replicating previous findings from epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of T2D. The TXNIP downmethylation coincided with increased transcription at the 3'-UTR, H3K36me3 histone markings, and Sp1 binding, suggesting spurious transcription initiation at the TXNIP 3'-UTR as a functional consequence of T2D methylation changes. We also explored potential epigenetic determinants to increased incidence of T2D in Filipino immigrants in the United States and found 3 DMPs associated with the interaction of T2D and immigration. Two of these DMPs were located near MAP 2 K7 and PRMT1, which may point towards dysregulated stress response and inflammation as a contributing factor to T2D among Filipino immigrants.© The Author(s) 2019.

For the  treatment (2) scenario we compare quantities that are suitable indexes based on outcome variables for each treatment conditional on patient-specific scores constructed from collected covariate measurements. Our method covers any number of treatments and outcome variables, and it can be applied for a broad set of models. The proposed method uses a rank aggregation technique to estimate an ordering of treatments based on ranked lists of treatment performance measures such as smooth conditional means and conditional probability of a response for one treatment dominating others. The method has the flexibility to incorporate patient and clinician preferences to the optimal treatment decision on an individual case basis. A simulation study demonstrates the performance of the proposed method in finite samples.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is one pathogenic factor in the development of insulin resistance in patients with obesity. We explored whether mitochondrial dysfunction correlates with insulin resistance and other metabolic complications.We investigated the changes of mRNA expression of genes encoding selected subunits of oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and citrate synthase (CS) in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) and peripheral monocytes (PM) and mitochondrial enzyme activity in platelets of 24 patients with active Cushing's syndrome and in 9 of them after successful treatment and 22 healthy control subjects.Patients with active Cushing's syndrome had significantly increased body mass index (BMI), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and serum lipids relative to the control group. The expression of all investigated genes for selected mitochondrial proteins was decreased in SCAT in patients with active Cushing's syndrome and remained decreased after successful treatment. The expression of most tested genes in SCAT correlated inversely with BMI and HOMA-IR. The expression of genes encoding selected OXPHOS subunits and CS was increased in PM in patients with active Cushing's syndrome with a tendency to decrease toward normal levels after cure. Patients with active Cushing's syndrome showed increased enzyme activity of complex I (NQR) in platelets.Mitochondrial function in SCAT in patients with Cushing's syndrome is impaired and only slightly affected by its treatment which may reflect ongoing metabolic disturbances even after successful treatment of Cushing's syndrome.© 2019 Ježková et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694993>A nationwide survey of adrenal incidentalomas in Japan: the first report of clinical and epidemiological features.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to reveal clear epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of incidentally discovered adrenal masses, termed adrenal incidentalomas (AIs), and to establish appropriate managemental and therapeutic regimens in Japan. This study had been originally carried out as a project of a research proposed on behalf of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, from 1999 to 2004. This nationwide multicenter study on AIs included 3,672 cases with clinically diagnosed AIs, involving 1,874 males and 1,738 females, with mean age 58.1 ± 13.0 years (mean ± SD). In the present study, we focused on the investigation of the real prevalence of various adrenal disorders with AI. The mean nodule size of AI based on computed tomography was 3.0 ± 2.0 cm. Compared to non-functioning adenomas (NFAs), tumor diameters were significantly larger in adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs), pheochromocytomas, cortisol-producing adenomas (CPAs), myelolipomas, metastatic tumors, cysts, and ganglioneuromas (p < 0.01). Endocrinological evaluations demonstrated that 50.8% of total AIs were non-functioning adenomas, while 10.5%, including 3.6% with subclinical Cushing's syndrome, were reported as CPAs, 8.5% as pheochromocytomas, and 5.1% as aldosterone-producing adenomas. ACCs were accounted for 1.4% (50 cases) among our series of AIs. In conclusion, while almost 50 % of AIs are non-functional adenomas, we must be particularly careful as AIs include pheochromocytomas or adrenal carcinomas, because they may be asymptomatic.

Olmesartan medoxomil (OM) is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and has been shown to exhibit renoprotective effects on a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rat model. Yet, whether OM affects DN progression and renal injury in db/db mice, a type 2 diabetic murine model, has not been established.Wild-type (n = 15) and db/db mice (n = 15) were treated with control saline or OM via oral gavage. The physiological and biochemical parameters were evaluated and histological examinations of kidney specimens were performed.Compared with saline-treated db/db mice, db/db mice administered with OM showed ameliorated diabetic physiological and biochemical parameters. In addition, OM decreased urinary albumin excretion and plasma creatinine level in db/db mice. Moreover, histologically, OM reduced glomerular hypertrophy and injury, and also ameliorated tubular injury, thus suggesting that OM improves renal function and minimizes renal pathological deterioration in db/db mice.Our study reveals a beneficial role of OM in ameliorating DN in db/db mice, which is associated with its renoprotective function.© 2019 Zhu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697444>Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion reduce the risk of postoperative infection.</a></h2><p>Perioperative hyperglycemia was associated with postoperative infection, and proper management of perioperative glucose has become critical in improving the prognosis of patients.1015 diabetic patients who underwent surgery and received insulin treatment for their hyperglycemia in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed. According to propensity matching, we obtained 253 pairs of patients from group received continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy (CSII group) and the group received insulin injection therapy (non-CSII group). Perioperative glucose levels and corresponding outcomes were compared between the two groups.Compared with non-CSII group, CSII group had lower fasting and mean glucose levels, lower incidence of fever (operation day: 18.6% vs 10.2%; P = 0.014; first postoperative day: 55.1% vs 34.7%; P<0.001) and positive rate of postoperative secretion culture (6.3% vs 1.2%; P = 0.004), shorter time of antibiotics use (total antibiotics use: P = 0.002; postoperative antibiotics use: P<0.001) and hospital stays (P<0.001). However, there was no difference in the total medical expenditure between the two groups (P = 0.499). Further analysis showed that CSII therapy was superior to multiple daily insulin injection therapy (MDI) therapy in its effect on infection and other postoperative outcomes when 64 pairs of patients from the CSII group and MDI group of non-CSII group were compared.CSII therapy provide better perioperative glucose control and lower risk of postoperative infection, without increasing the total medical expenditure.

Twenty-four diabetic patients with periodontitis (Group 1) and twenty-four diabetic patients with gingivitis (Group 2) were followed up for a period of 12 months. Group 1 was treated with periodontal debridement, and Group 2 received supra-gingival scaling and prophylaxis. In both groups, periodontal clinical parameters: probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival resection (GR), bleeding on probing index (BOP) and plaque index; inflammatory serum markers (glycemia, A1c, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c), triglycerides and hs-CRP) and oxidized LDL (oxLDL) were measured at baseline, t = 6 and t = 12 months after treatment. Solutions of LDL were analyzed using the nonlinear optical Z-Scan and optical absorption techniques. The periodontal clinical parameters showed significant improvement (p < 0.05) in both Group after 12 months. For both groups, total cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c, triglycerides and A1c levels did not show significant reductions after periodontal therapy. hs-CRP levels in Group 1 presented a significant reduction after 12 months. The glycemic rate and the oxLDL concentrations did not show significant differences as a function of time. The optical measurements of LDL solutions revealed an improvement of the LDL-c quality in both groups. Periodontal debridement was able to improve periodontal parameters and the quality of LDL-c in diabetic patients but without changes in the oxLDL concentration in both groups.

To better understand the integrated molecular physiological effects of adipose H6PDH, we created a tissue-specific knockout of the H6PDH gene mouse model in adipocytes (H6PDHAcKO mice). H6PDHAcKO mice exhibited almost complete absence of H6PDH expression and decreased intra-adipose corticosterone production with a reduction of 11β-HSD1 activity in adipose tissue. These mice also had decreased abdominal fat mass, which was paralleled by decreased adipose lipogenic ACC and ACL gene expression and reduction of their transcription factor C/EBPα mRNA levels. Moreover, H6PDHAcKO mice also had reduced fasting blood glucose levels, increased glucose tolerance, and increased insulin sensitivity. In addition, plasma FFA levels were decreased with a concomitant decrease in the expression of lipase ATGL and HSL in adipose tissue. These results indicate that inactivation of adipocyte H6PDH expression is sufficient to cause intra-adipose GC inactivation that leads to a favorable pattern of metabolic phenotypes. These data suggest that H6PDHAcKO mice may provide a good model for studying the potential contributions of fat-specific H6PDH inhibition to improve the metabolic phenotype in vivo. Our study suggests that suppression or inactivation of H6PDH expression in adipocytes could be an effective intervention for treating obesity and .Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695722>A Novel Compound Heterozygous  Variant Causes 17α-Hydroxylase/17, 20-Lyase Deficiency.</a></h2><p> Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) encompasses a group of autosomal recessive diseases characterized by enzyme deficiencies, within steroid hormone anabolism, which lead to disorders in cortisol synthesis. The 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency (17-OHD) is an uncommon form of CAH caused by variants in the  gene.  We report a novel compound heterozygous  variant and its association with the pathogenesis of 17-OHD.  The patient was assessed for medical history, clinical manifestations, physical examination, laboratory examination, karyotype analysis, and adrenal computed tomography. Mutation screening was conducted using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing. The wild-type and mutant  complementary DNAs (cDNAs) were amplified and cloned into a pcDNA3.1(+) vector. These plasmids were transfected transiently into HEK-293T cells. Quantitative PCR and Western blotting analysis were performed to measure the expression level of P450c17. An enzymatic activity assay was conducted to measure the content of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in medium using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).  The proband was characterized by 17-OHD with rhabdomyolysis, hypokalemia, and adrenal insufficiency. Novel compound heterozygous variants of the  gene (c.1304T > C/p.Phe435Ser and c.1228delG/p.Asp410Ilefs*9) were identified. The enzymatic activity assay revealed that this variant resulted in a complete deficiency of 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activity. This was consistent with the hormonal characteristics of the proband's blood.  These results suggest that the compound heterozygous variant of c.1304T > C and c.1228delG of the  gene can lead to 17-OHD. Our findings thus provide a novel insight into the clinical evaluations and molecular basis of 17-OHD.Copyright © 2019 Chen, Yuan, Zhang, Jia, Chen, Zhu, Sun, Zhou, Huang, Liang, Yan and Wang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695332>Coenzyme q10 liquid supplementation in dyslipidemic subjects with statin-related clinical symptoms: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.</a></h2><p>Statin-associated myalgia occurs in about 1-3% of patients in the medical literature. Plasma CoQ10 levels are reduced in patients undergoing statin.The primary outcome was the detection of clinical symptoms and the perception of pain evaluated throughout specific questionnaires. The secondary outcome was the variation in lipid profile and the variation in safety parameters.We enrolled 60 Caucasian patients, intolerant to statins. During the run-in period, patients underwent a 1-month wash-out period during which statins were stopped. At the end of the wash-out period, if CPK and/or transaminases returned within an acceptable range, statins were re-introduced at half of the previously taken dose. After one month, patients were randomized to take either a liquid CoQ10 supplement or a placebo for three months at 100 mg/day.The Clinical Index Score for myalgia assessment was lower after 3 months with CoQ10, while it did not change with the placebo. The VAS score was lower after 3 months of CoQ10 supplementation, while no variation was recorded with the placebo. In the group treated with the dietary supplement, CoQ10 plasma concentrations were inversely correlated with CPK levels, Clinical Index Score absolute values, and VAS.The addition of CoQ10 with half dosage statin in patients with previous intolerance to statins improves the perception of clinical symptoms such as asthenia, myalgia or pain.© 2019 Derosa et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691829>When does prone sleeping improve cardiorespiratory status in preterm infants in the NICU?</a></h2><p>Preterm infants undergoing intensive care are often placed prone to improve respiratory function. Current clinical guidelines recommend preterm infants are slept supine from 32 weeks' postmenstrual age, regardless of gestational age at birth. However, respiratory function is also related to gestational and chronological ages and is affected by sleep state. We aimed to identify the optimal timing for adopting the supine sleeping position in preterm infants, using a longitudinal design assessing the effects of sleep position and state on cardiorespiratory stability.Twenty-three extremely (24-28 weeks' gestation) and 33 very preterm (29-34 weeks' gestation) infants were studied weekly from birth until discharge, in both prone and supine positions, in quiet and active sleep determined by behavioral scoring. Bradycardia (heart rate ≤100 bpm), desaturation (oxygen saturation ≤80%), and apnea (pause in respiratory rate ≥10 s) episodes were analyzed.Prone positioning in extremely preterm infants reduced the frequency of bradycardias and desaturations and duration of desaturations. In very preterm infants, prone positioning only reduced the frequency of desaturations. The position-related effects were not related to postmenstrual age. Quiet sleep in both preterm groups was associated with fewer bradycardias and desaturations, and also reduced durations of bradycardia and desaturations in the very preterm group.Cardiorespiratory stability is improved by the prone sleep position, predominantly in extremely preterm infants, and the improvements are not dependent on postmenstrual age. In very preterm infants, quiet sleep has a more marked effect than the prone position. This evidence should be considered in individualizing management of preterm infant positioning.© Sleep Research Society 2019.
