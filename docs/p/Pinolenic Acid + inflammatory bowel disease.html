We hypothesized that unsaturated FA could alleviate saturated FA-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurring in intestinal secretory goblet cells, and consequently the reduced synthesis and secretion of mucins that form the protective mucus barrier. To investigate this hypothesis, we treated well-differentiated human colonic LS174T goblet cells with palmitic  (PAL)-the most commonly used inducer of lipotoxicity in in vitro systems-or -9, -6, or -3 unsaturated fatty acids alone or in co-treatment with PAL, and measured the impact of such treatments on ER stress and Muc2 production. Our results showed that only eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids protect goblet cells against ER stress-mediated altered Muc2 secretion induced by PAL, whereas neither  nor -9 and -6 FA are able to provide such protection. We conclude that EPA and DHA could represent potential therapeutic nutrients against the detrimental lipotoxicity of saturated fatty acids, associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity or . These in vitro data remain to be explored in vivo in a context of dietary obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25634802>Modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR γ) by conjugated fatty  in  and inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Conjugated fatty acids including conjugated linoleic  (CLA) and conjugated  (CLNA) have drawn significant attention for their variety of biologically beneficial effects. Evidence suggested that CLA and CLNA could play physiological roles by regulating the expression and activity of PPAR γ. This review summarizes the current understanding of evidence of the role of CLA (cis-9,trans-11 CLA and trans-10,cis-12 CLA) and CLNA (punicic  and α-eleostearic ) in modulating the expression or activity of PPAR γ that could in turn be employed as complementary treatment for  and inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30680455>Dietary intake of fish, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and risk of inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.</a></h2><p>Fish consumption and dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated acids (PUFAs) may be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to conduct a systematic review and summarize published articles on the association between fish consumption and dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs with the risk of IBD.PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were used to conduct a comprehensive search and identify eligible literature published prior to January 2019. Fixed-effects model or random-effects models (DerSimonian-Laird method) were applied to pool the effect sizes. Cochrane Q test was used to trace the potential source of heterogeneity across studies.12 studies (5 prospective and 7 case-control) were included in the systematic review, which ten of them were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Studies were included a total sample size of 282610 participants which 2002 of them were cases of IBD [1061 Crohn's disease (CD) and 937 ulcerative  (UC)]. A negative association was found between fish consumption and the incidence of CD (pooled effect size: 0.54, 95%CI: 0.31-0.96, P = 0.03). There was no relationship between total dietary n-3 PUFAs intake and IBD (pooled effect size: 1.17, 95%CI: 0.80-1.72, P = 0.41). A significant inverse association was observed between dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs and the risk of UC (pooled effect size: 0.75, 95%CI: 0.57-0.98, P = 0.03). Moreover, no association was found between α- (ALA) and IBD (pooled effect size: 1.17, 95%CI: 0.63-2.17, P = 0.62).Findings showed a negative association between fish consumption and the risk of CD. Moreover, there was a significant inverse association between dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs and the risk of UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26350254>α- (ALA) is an anti-inflammatory agent in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Studies suggest that consumption of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) plays a protective role in inflammatory bowel disease; however, the use of plant-derived oils rich in α- (ALA) has not been widely investigated. The aims of this study were to test the effects of two different sources of (n-3) PUFA, fish and plant-derived oils, in two animal models of experimental  and to determine whether the (n-3) PUFA-enriched diets could ameliorate the inflammatory status. Rats were fed diets rich in corn, fish or sage oil with or without vitamin A supplementation for 3weeks then  was induced by adding dextran sodium sulfate to the drinking water or by injecting 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic . We show that colitic rats fed the sage oil diets had a lower inflammatory response, improved histological repair and had less necrotic damage in the mucosa when compared to the corn and fish oil groups. Colonic damage and myeloperoxidase activity were significantly lower. Colonic mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes including interleukin IL-6, cyclooxygenase 2 and tumor necrosis factor α were markedly down-regulated in rats fed fish and sage oils compared to control. These results were supported by experiments in the human colonic epithelial cell line Caco-2, where ALA supplementation was shown to be effective in inhibiting inflammation induced by IL-1β by down-regulating mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes including IL-8, COX2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Taken together, these results suggest that plant-derived oil rich in ALA could ameliorate the inflammatory damage in .Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, the mechanism(s) by which EEN suppresses inflammation are not yet fully understood. The aims were to examine cellular mechanism(s) through which EEN may suppress inflammation and investigate potential pathways to enhance anti-inflammatory properties of EEN.Glutamine, arginine, vitamin D, and α  (ALA), present in PF, along with curcumin, were identified as immunoactive nutrient therapies. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-exposed HT-29 colonic epithelial cells were used to investigate the immunosuppressive activity of the nutrients by assessing their effect on cell viability, cell activity, chemokine response (interleukin-8 [IL-8]), nuclear factor (NF)-κB, P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, IκB kinase (Iκκ), and nitric oxide (NO).Cellular viability and activity were maintained with all nutrient treatments. Glutamine, arginine, and vitamin D, but not ALA, significantly attenuated IL-8 production. Glutamine and arginine led to phosphorylation blockade of the signaling components in NF-κB and P38 pathways, reduction in kinase activity, and enhancement in NO production. Combining glutamine, arginine, and curcumin at optimal concentrations completely abolished the IL-8 response.These data indicate that glutamine, arginine, and vitamin D can suppress inflammation at concentrations equivalent to those used in PF. The mechanisms of this action were mediated through influencing the NF-κB and P38 cascades. Glutamine and arginine-fortified PF with curcumin might be a promising option to enhance the effectiveness and expand the scope of EEN therapy in CD treatment.</p></html>
