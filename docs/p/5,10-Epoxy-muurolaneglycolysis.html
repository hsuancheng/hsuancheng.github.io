The effects of several tea constituents on male reproduction have been investigated, but L-theanine has been overlooked. Sertoli cells (SCs) are essential for the physical and nutritional support of germ cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate the ability of L-theanine to modulate important mechanisms of human SCs (hSCs) metabolism, mitochondrial function and oxidative profile, which are essential to prevent or counteract spermatogenesis disruption in several health conditions.We evaluated the effect of a dose of L-theanine attained by tea intake ( μM) or a pharmacological dose (50 μM) on the metabolism (proton nuclear magnetic resonance and Western blot), mitochondrial functionality (protein expression of mitochondrial complexes and JC1 ratio) and oxidative profile (carbonyl levels, nitration and lipid peroxidation) of cultured hSCs.Exposure of hSCs to 50 µM of L-theanine increased cell proliferation and glucose consumption. In response to this metabolic adaptation, there was an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential, which may compromise the prooxidant-antioxidant balance. Still, no alterations were observed regarding the oxidative damages.A pharmacological dose of L-theanine (50 µM) prompts an increase in hSCs proliferation and a higher glucose metabolization to sustain the pool of Krebs cycle intermediates, which are crucial for cellular bioenergetics and biosynthesis. This study suggests an interplay between  and glutaminolysis in the regulation of hSCs metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485631>Tanshinone IIA inhibits glucose metabolism leading to apoptosis in cervical cancer.</a></h1><p>Cancer requires aerobic  to supply the energy required for proliferation. Existing evidence has revealed that blocking  results in apoptosis of cancer cells. Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) is a diterpenoid naphthoquinone found in traditional Chinese medicine, Danshen (Salvia sp.). Tan IIA exhibits potential anticancer activity. However, its effect on cell viability of human cervical cancer cells and its mechanism are unknown. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of Tan IIA on proliferation and glucose metabolism in cervical cancer cells. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay, apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry and glucose uptake, lactate production, and adenosine triphosphate content were measured to assess glucose metabolism. The expression of apoptosis‑associated proteins was detected by western blotting and the antitumor activity of Tan IIA in vivo was evaluated in cervical carcinoma‑bearing mice. The results revealed Tan IIA treatment resulted in a considerable reduction in the viability of SiHa cells. Tan IIA decreased the expression of HPV oncogenes E6 and E7, induced apoptosis and also decreased  by suppressing the activity of the intracellular AKT/mTOR and HIF‑1α. In vivo, treatment with Tan IIA resulted in a 72.7% reduction in tumor volume. The present study highlights the potential therapeutic value of Tan IIA, which functions by inducing apoptosis and may be associated with inhibition of .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31466233>A Cyclic Pentamethinium Salt Induces Cancer Cell Cytotoxicity through Mitochondrial Disintegration and Metabolic Collapse.</a></h1><p>Cancer cells preferentially utilize  for ATP production even in aerobic conditions (the Warburg effect) and adapt mitochondrial processes to their specific needs. Recent studies indicate that altered mitochondrial activities in cancer represent an actionable target for therapy. We previously showed that salt 1-, a quinoxaline unit (with cytotoxic activity) incorporated into a meso-substituted pentamethinium salt (with mitochondrial selectivity and fluorescence properties), displayed potent cytotoxic effects in vitro and in vivo, without significant toxic effects to normal tissues. Here, we investigated the cytotoxic mechanism of salt 1- compared to its analogue, salt 1-, with an extended side carbon chain. Live cell imaging demonstrated that salt 1-, but not 1-, is rapidly incorporated into mitochondria, correlating with increased cytotoxicity of salt 1-. The accumulation in mitochondria led to their fragmentation and loss of function, accompanied by increased autophagy/mitophagy. Salt 1- preferentially activated AMP-activated kinase and inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways, sensors of cellular metabolism, but did not induce apoptosis. These data indicate that salt 1- cytotoxicity involves mitochondrial perturbation and disintegration, and such compounds are promising candidates for targeting mitochondria as a weak spot of cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427247>Global heterogeneity assessed with F-FDG PET/CT. Relation with biological variables and prognosis in locally advanced breast cancer.</a></h1><p>To analyze the relationship between measurements of global heterogeneity, obtained from F-FDG PET/CT, with biological variables, and their predictive and prognostic role in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC).68 patients from a multicenter and prospective study, with LABC and a baseline F-FDG PET/CT were included. Immunohistochemical profile [estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR), expression of the HER-2 oncogene, Ki-67 proliferation index and tumor histological grade], response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC), overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were obtained as clinical variables. Three-dimensional segmentation of the lesions, providing SUV, volumetric [metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion  (TLG)] and global heterogeneity variables [coefficient of variation (COV) and SUVmean/SUVmax ratio], as well as sphericity was performed. The correlation between the results obtained with the immunohistochemical profile, the response to NC and survival was also analyzed.Of the patients included, 62 received NC. Only 18 responded. 13 patients relapsed and 11 died during follow-up. ER negative tumors had a lower COV (p=0.018) as well as those with high Ki-67 (p=0.001) and high risk phenotype (p=0.033) compared to the rest. No PET variable showed association with the response to NC nor OS. There was an inverse relationship between sphericity with DFS (p=0.041), so, for every tenth that sphericity increases, the risk of recurrence decreases by 37%.Breast tumors in our LABC dataset behaved as homogeneous and spherical lesions. Larger volumes were associated with a lower sphericity. Global heterogeneity variables and sphericity do not seem to have a predictive role in response to NC nor in OS. More spherical tumors with less variation in gray intensity between voxels showed a lower risk of recurrence.Copyright © 2019 Sociedad Española de Medicina Nuclear e Imagen Molecular.

Zinc protects chondrocytes from MIA-induced damage. Here, we explored the protective effects of 25 μM zinc on  μM MIA-treated SW1353 cells (human chondrosarcoma cell line) through the analysis of energy metabolism- and autophagy-related parameters. We found that the exposure of SW1353 cells to MIA decreased ATP levels, expression of -related proteins, including glucose transporter 1, hexokinase 2, and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit alpha, and the levels of mitochondrial complex I, II, IV, and V subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. MIA treatment also decreased the expression of autophagy-related proteins, including autophagic elongation protein  (ATG5), ATG7, and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3-II) and mitophagy-related proteins, including phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), ubiquitin, and p62. These results indicate that MIA interferes with energy metabolism and the autophagic clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria (so called mitophagy). Interestingly, zinc exposure could almost completely reverse the effects of MIA, suggesting its potential protective role against OA progression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To date, very few available drugs have been successfully used to treat PDAC due to the poor understanding of the tumor-specific features. One of the hallmarks of pancreatic cancer cells is the deregulated cellular energetics characterized by the "Warburg effect". It has been known for decades that cancer cells have a dramatically increased glycolytic flux even in the presence of oxygen and normal mitochondrial function. Glycolytic flux is the central carbon metabolism process in all cells, which not only produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but also provides biomass for anabolic processes that support cell proliferation. Expression levels of glucose transporters and rate-limiting enzymes regulate the rate of glycolytic flux. Intermediates that branch out from  are responsible for redox homeostasis, glycosylation, and biosynthesis. Beyond enhanced glycolytic flux, pancreatic cancer cells activate nutrient salvage pathways, which includes autophagy and micropinocytosis, from which the generated sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids are used to buffer the stresses induced by nutrient deprivation. Further, PDAC is characterized by extensive metabolic crosstalk between tumor cells and cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this review, we will give an overview on recent progresses made in understanding glucose metabolism-related deregulations in PDAC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624330>Membrane bound IL-21 based NK cell feeder cells drive robust expansion and metabolic activation of NK cells.</a></h1><p>NK cell adoptive therapy is a promising cancer therapeutic approach, but there are significant challenges that limiting its feasibility and clinical efficacy. One difficulty is the paucity of clinical grade manufacturing platforms to support the large scale expansion of highly active NK cells. We created an NK cell feeder cell line termed 'NKF' through overexpressing membrane bound IL-21 that is capable of inducing robust and sustained proliferation (>10,000-fold expansion at  weeks) of highly cytotoxic NK cells. The expanded NK cells exhibit increased cytotoxic function against a panel of blood cancer and solid tumor cells as compared to IL-2-activated non-expanded NK cells. The NKF-expanded NK cells also demonstrate efficacy in mouse models of human sarcoma and T cell leukemia. Mechanistic studies revealed that membrane-bound IL-21 leads to an activation of a STAT3/c-Myc pathway and increased NK cell metabolism with a shift towards aerobic . The NKF feeder cell line is a promising new platform that enables the large scale proliferation of highly active NK cells in support of large scale third party NK cell clinical studies that have been recently intiatied. These results also provide mechanistic insights into how membrane-bound IL-21 regulates NK cell expansion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31286200>Radiomic features of glucose metabolism enable prediction of outcome in mantle cell lymphoma.</a></h1><p>To determine whether [F]FDG PET/CT-derived radiomic features alone or in combination with clinical, laboratory and biological parameters are predictive of 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and whether they enable outcome prognostication.Included in this retrospective study were 107 treatment-naive MCL patients scheduled to receive CD20 antibody-based immuno(chemo)therapy. Standardized uptake values (SUV), total lesion , and 16 co-occurrence matrix radiomic features were extracted from metabolic tumour volumes on pretherapy [F]FDG PET/CT scans. A multilayer perceptron neural network in combination with logistic regression analyses for feature selection was used for prediction of 2-year PFS. International prognostic indices for MCL (MIPI and MIPI-b) were calculated and combined with the radiomic data. Kaplan-Meier estimates with log-rank tests were used for PFS prognostication.SUVmean (OR 1.272, P = 0.013) and Entropy (heterogeneity of glucose metabolism; OR 1.131, P = 0.027) were significantly predictive of 2-year PFS: median areas under the curve were 0.72 based on the two radiomic features alone, and 0.82 with the addition of clinical/laboratory/biological data. Higher SUVmean in combination with higher Entropy (SUVmean >3.55 and entropy >3.), reflecting high "metabolic risk", was associated with a poorer prognosis (median PFS 20.3 vs. 39.4 months, HR 2.285, P = 0.005). The best PFS prognostication was achieved using the MIPI-bm (MIPI-b and metabolic risk combined): median PFS 43.2, 38.2 and 20.3 months in the low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk groups respectively (P = 0.005).In MCL, the [F]FDG PET/CT-derived radiomic features SUVmean and Entropy may improve prediction of 2-year PFS and PFS prognostication. The best results may be achieved using a combination of metabolic, clinical, laboratory and biological parameters.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31138783>Cloxiquine, a traditional antituberculosis agent, suppresses the growth and metastasis of melanoma cells through activation of PPARγ.</a></h1><p>Melanoma is one of the most aggressive skin cancers and -year survival rate is only 4.6% for metastatic melanoma patients. Current therapies, especially those involving clinical chemotherapy drugs, have achieved remarkable advances. However, their side effects, such as bone marrow suppression, limit the effectiveness of available pharmacological therapies. Therefore, exploring new antimelanoma drugs with less toxicity is critical for the treatment of melanoma. In the present study, we aimed to identify the antimelanoma drugs with ability to repress the proliferation of melanoma cells by using a high-content screening of FDA-approved drug libraries. We found that cloxiquine (CLQ), a traditional antituberculosic drug, exhibited strong inhibitory effects on the growth and metastasis of melanoma cells both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, CLQ at the tested doses did not show any apparent toxicity in normal melanocytes and in the liver. At the metabolic level, treatment with CLQ decreased , thus potentially inhibiting the "Warburg effect" in B16F10 cells. More importantly, combination of CLQ and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), a well-known  inhibitor, did not show a synergistic effect on the tumor growth and metastasis, indicating that inhibition of  is potentially involved in mediating CLQ's antimelanoma function. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) served as a potential CLQ target. Mechanistically, CLQ stimulated the transcription and nuclear contents of PPARγ. Furthermore, the specific PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 or PPARγ shRNA partially abolished the effects of CLQ. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CLQ has a great potential in the treatment of melanoma through activation of PPARγ.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31207291>Optogenetic switch for controlling the central metabolic flux of Escherichia coli.</a></h1><p>Dynamically controlling cellular metabolism can improve a cell's yield and productivity towards a target compound. However, the application of this strategy is currently limited by the availability of reversible metabolic switches. Unlike chemical inducers, light can readily be applied and removed from the medium multiple times without causing chemical changes. This makes light-inducible systems a potent tool to dynamically control cellular metabolism. Here we describe the construction of a light-inducible metabolic switch to regulate flux distribution between two glycolytic pathways, the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) and oxidative pentose phosphate (oxPP) pathways. This was achieved by using chromatic acclimation sensor/regulator (CcaSR) optogenetic system to control the expression of pgi, a metabolic gene which expression determines flux distribution between EMP and oxPP pathways. Control over these pathways may allow us to maximize Escherichia coli's yield on highly-reduced compounds such as mevalonate. Background pgi expression of the initial CcaSR construct was too high to significantly reduce pgi expression during the OFF-state. Therefore, we attenuated the system's output leakage by adjusting plasmid copy number and by tagging Pgi with ssRA protein degradation signal. Using our CcaSR-pgi ver.3, we could control EMP:oxPP flux ratio to 50:49 and 0.:99 (of total glycolytic flux) by exposure to green and red light, respectively.Copyright © 2019 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

Heterogeneity factor (HF) was obtained by finding the derivative of the volume-threshold function from 40 to 80% of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). Univariate and multivariate stepwise logistic regression analyses were used to identify these PET parameters and clinicopathological variables associated with OLM.Statistically significant differences were detected in sex, tumor site, SUVmax, mean SUV (SUVmean), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion  and HF between patients with adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC). OLM was detected in 36 (16.7%) of 215 patients (ADC, 27/152 = 17.8% vs. SQCC, 9/63 = 14.3%). In multivariate analysis, MTV (OR = 1.671, P = 0.044) in ADC and HF (OR = 8.799, P = 0.023) in SQCC were potent associated factors for the prediction of OLM. The optimal cutoff values of .12 cm for MTV in ADC, and 0.198 for HF in SQCC were determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.In conclusion, MTV was an independent predictor of OLM in cT1-2N0M0 ADC patients, while HF might be the most powerful predictor for OLM in SQCC. These findings would be helpful in selecting patients who might be considered as candidates for sublobar resection or new stereotactic ablative radiotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611016>Metagenomic analysis of the biotoxicity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles to microbial nitrogen transformation in constructed wetlands.</a></h1><p>Extensive use of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO NPs) in various products has increased the release of these particles into wastewater, posing potential environmental risks. As an ecological wastewater treatment facility, constructed wetland (CW) is an important sink of NPs. However, little is known about the effects of NPs on microbial nitrogen transformation and related genes in CWs. In this study, short-term ( days) and long-term (60 days) exposure experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of TiO NPs (0, 1, and 50 mg/L) on microbial nitrogen removal in CWs. The results showed that nitrogen removal efficiency was decreased by 35%-51% after long-term exposure to TiO NPs. Metagenomic analysis further confirmed that TiO NPs declined the relative abundance of functional genes and those enzyme encoding genes involved in the nitrogen metabolism pathway and  metabolism process. Furthermore, our data proved that the indigent  metabolism process resulted in the shortage of electron (NADH) and energy sources (ATP), causing inefficient nitrogen removal. Overall, these results revealed that the accumulation of TiO NPs altered the genetic expression of biofilm in CWs, which had significant impacts on biological nitrogen transformation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Electroacupuncture pretreatment (EP) is a recent observation which has been shown to induce ischemic tolerance like the ischemia preconditioning, suggesting that EP may be a promising preventive strategy for individual susceptibility to MI. This study investigated mechanisms that underlie the effect of EP on MI through the use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolic profiling. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided to receive or not receive three days of EP at PC6 (Neiguan). Then on the fourth day, each group was further divided to undergo mock surgery or MI, induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. After 24h, the blood samples and hearts were collected for the follow-up research. The results showed that treatment by EP significantly reduced the levels of CK-MB, cTnT, AST, and MDH in serum and decreased myocardial infarction area. According to GC-MS-based serum metabolic profiling and analysis, a total of 636 characteristic peaks were identified, including 158 known and 478 unknown metabolites. MI caused comprehensive metabolic changes in -related metabolites, malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) metabolites, and purine metabolites with anti-oxidant functions, while EP reversed more than half of the differential metabolic changes, mainly affecting amino acid and energy metabolism, especially the glutamate metabolism and MAS. In a word, our findings suggest that EP exerts its cardioprotective effect on MI by regulating amino acid and energy metabolisms. Meanwhile, GC-MS-based metabolomics provided a powerful way to characterize the metabolic features of MI, with and without EP, and thereby improved our understanding of the effect and mechanisms of EP.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668072>Glechomanamides A-C, Germacrane Sesquiterpenoids with an Unusual Δ-7,12-Lactam Moiety from  and Their Antiangiogenic Activity.</a></h1><p>Three new germacrane sesquiterpenoid-type alkaloids with an unusual Δ-7,12-lactam moiety, glechomanamides A-C (-), and two pairs of 7,12-hemiketal sesquiterpenoid epimers (/, /) were isolated from .

This study aimed at investigating absolute expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha subunit (HIF1A) and genes involved in stress responses and muscle repair using a droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. Total RNA was isolated from pectoralis major collected from male 6-week-old medium (carcass weight ≤ 2. kg) and heavy (carcass weight > 2. kg) broilers. Samples were classified as "non-defective" (n = 4), "medium-WS" (n = 6), "heavy-WS" (n = 7) and "heavy-WS+WB" (n = 3) based on abnormality scores. The HIF1A transcript was up-regulated in all of the abnormal groups. Transcript abundances of genes encoding 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 4 (PFKFB4), lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA), and phosphorylase kinase beta subunit (PHKB) were increased in heavy-WS but decreased in heavy-WS+WB. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was up-regulated in non-defective samples. The muscle-specific mu-2 isoform of glutathione S-transferases (GSTM2) was up-regulated in the abnormal samples, particularly in the heavy groups. The genes encoding myogenic differentiation (MYOD1) and myosin light chain kinase (MYLK) exhibited similar expression pattern, of which medium-WS and heavy-WS significantly increased compared to non-defective whereas expression in heavy-WS+WB was not different from either non-defective or WS-affected group. The greatest and the lowest levels of calpain-3 (CAPN3) and delta-sarcoglycan (SCGD) were observed in heavy-WS and heavy-WS+WB, respectively. Based on micrographs, the abnormal muscles primarily comprised fibers with cross-sectional areas ranging from 2,000 to 3,000 μm2. Despite induced  at the transcriptional level, lower stored glycogen in the abnormal muscles corresponded with the reduced lactate and higher pH within their meats. The findings support hypoxia within the abnormal breasts, potentially associated with oversized muscle fibers.

To suppress lactate production, it is necessary to regenerate NAD consumed by  with alternative pathways other than lactate dehydrogenase. In a heterofermentative lactic acid bacterium, Lactobacillus reuteri JCM1112, suppression of lactate production by regenerating NAD when producing 1,3-propanediol from glycerol was investigated. The bacterium produced lactate with a yield of 4.7 ± 0.8 g·g-cell in a batch culture using glucose as the sole carbon source. When glycerol was added to glucose at a molar ratio (r) of three in the batch culture, the bacterium produced 1,3-propanediol at 1.6 ± 0.7 g·g-cell·h and the lactate yield decreased to 3.6 ± 0. g·g-cell. When glycerol was co-fed with glucose exponentially to give a target specific growth rate of 0.1 h (r = 3), the lactate yield decreased to 1. ± 0.2 g·g-cell.

Tumor metabolic parameters [maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion  (TLG)] were retrospectively assessed in a consecutive cohort of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer patients undergoing primary (chemo-)radiation. Main outcome measures were larynx preservation and survival. The study included 97 patients with a median follow-up of 32 months (IQR 20-54.). For hypopharyngeal cancer, multivariable analysis showed that patients with a primary tumor's SUV > 9. entailed a higher risk of undergoing salvage pharyngolaryngectomy after chemoradiation (HR = 8.64, 95% CI = 1.1-67.3, P = 0.040). In laryngeal cancer, SUV did not predict the need for salvage laryngectomy. The only predictor for larynx preservation in laryngeal cancer patients was T-classification at initial diagnosis (HR = 6.67, 95% CI = 0.82-53.9, P = 0.039). In conclusion, SUV of primary tumor could be used as a predictor of larynx preservation prior to primary chemoradiation in hypopharyngeal cancer patients. This information may be important for patient counseling, as high SUV was correlated with reduced probability of larynx preservation. However, in laryngeal cancer patients, SUV does not seem to be predictive of outcome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31369364>Comparative proteomic analysis of plant-pathogen interactions in resistant and susceptible poplar ecotypes infected with .</a></h1><p>Poplar are important forestry species in China, but the  pathogen causes serious economic losses worldwide. To identify candidate  resistance proteins and explore the molecular mechanisms involved in poplar-pathogen interactions, proteomic responses of stem samples from resistant and susceptible poplar ecotypes to  were investigated using nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with label-free quantitative analysis. We identified 588 proteins, divided into 21 biological process categories including 48 oxidoreductases, 72 hydrolytic enzymes, 80 metabolic enzymes, and 29 proteins of unknown function. Differential proteome analysis revealed large differences between resistant P. tomentosa and susceptible  Hsu ecotypes before and after inoculation. Among 102 identified proteins, 22 were highly up-regulated in the resistant genotype but down-regulated in the susceptible genotype.

Black raspberries (BRBs) have been shown to inhibit oral carcinogenesis in several preclinical models, but our understanding of how BRB phytochemicals affect the metabolic pathways during oral carcinogenesis remains incomplete. We used a well-established rat oral cancer model to determine potential metabolic pathways impacted by BRBs during oral carcinogenesis. F344 rats were exposed to the oral carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in drinking water for 14 weeks, then regular drinking water for six weeks. Carcinogen exposed rats were fed a % or 10% BRB supplemented diet or control diet for six weeks after carcinogen exposure.

Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) was measured using threshold-based methods with a threshold of 40% maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). The derivative of the volume (V)-threshold (T) function (volume difference/threshold difference) was defined as the heterogeneity factor (HF). In addition, SUVmax, SUVmean, total lesion  (TLG), maximum tumor-to-blood SUV ratio (SURmax), SURmean and several clinicopathologic parameters were analyzed to identify risk factors of LNM and OLNM.SUVmax, SUVmean, MTV, TLG, SURmax, SURmean and HF were significantly different between LNM (+) and LNM (-). The optimal cut-off values of those parameters were 12., 8.34, 15.01, 117.185, 7.885, 4.855 and 0.300, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that MTV (OR = 1.127, P = 0.04) and SURmax (OR = 1.446, P = 0.004) were independent predictors of LNM, with sensitivity and specificity were 51.2%, 83.7% vs. 53.7%, 79.1%. In univariate and multivariate analysis, MTV was the sole parameter associated with OLMN (P = 0.024).MTV and SURmax were statistically significant predictors of LNM in patients with ESCC, while MTV was a predictor of OLNM. High SURmax and MTV may indicate that the treatment planning should be tailored, which may improve patient prognosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537452>Comparison of metabolic profiles of yeasts based on the difference of the Crabtree positive and negative.</a></h1><p>The Crabtree effect involves energy management in which yeasts utilize  as the terminal electron acceptor instead of oxygen, despite the presence of sufficient dissolved oxygen, when oxygen concentrations exceed a certain limit. The Crabtree effect is detrimental to bakery yeast production, because it results in lower cellular glucose yields. Batch culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a Crabtree positive yeast, decreased the cell yield of glucose and produced large amounts of ethanol despite a high specific glucose consumption rate compared to Candida utilis, a Crabtree negative yeast. This study investigated the effect of these characteristics on metabolite levels. We performed metabolome analysis of both yeasts during each growth phase of batch culture using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Principle component analysis of metabolome data indicated that the Crabtree effect affected metabolites related to NADH synthesis in central metabolism. The amount of these metabolites in S. cerevisiae was lower than that in C. utilis. However, to maintain the specific glucose consumption rate at high levels, yeasts must avoid depletion of NAD, which is essential for glucose utilization. Our results indicated that NADH was oxidized by converting acetaldehyde to ethanol in S. cerevisiae, which is in accordance with previous reports. Therefore, the specific NADH production rates of S. cerevisiae and C. utilis did not show a difference. This study suggested that NAD/NADH ratio is disrupted by the Crabtree effect, which in turn influenced central metabolism and that S. cerevisiae maintained the NAD/NADH ratio by producing ethanol.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

We identified 5932 high-confidence proteins; 1494 were differentially abundant between the two samples, including 749 up- and 745 down-regulated proteins. The up- and down-regulated proteins that could be essential for anther development and male sterility in sterile buds were mainly involved in (1) carbohydrate and energy metabolism (pyruvate dehydrogenase, /gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle, starch and sucrose metabolism), (2) pollen wall synthesis and regulation (pectinesterase, polygalacturonase, pectate lyase, beta-galactosidase, glycosyl hydrolase), (3) protein synthesis and degradation (proteasome subunits, ribosome proteins, ABC transporters, RNA transport, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum), (4) flavonoid biosynthesis, and () plant hormone signal transduction. We identified 10 genes/proteins that were both up-regulated and 122 that were both down-regulated in a conjoint analysis. Multiple reaction monitoring and qRT-PCR validation showed that the iTRAQ results were accurate and reliable. These findings will provide valuable information on proteins involved in anther development, and will contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) that underlie male sterility in Chinese cabbage. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Chinese cabbage is an allogamous plant with bisexual flowers that displays significant heterosis. The application of male sterile lines is a very efficient way to produce hybrid seeds, which can generate stronger plants that develop more rapidly and produce higher yield. However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying multiple-allele-inherited male sterility in Chinese cabbage is unknown. In this study, we used a quantitative proteomic approach (iTRAQ) to identify DAPs between fertile and sterile buds of the GMS line 'AB01'. Subsequently, we also performed conjoined analysis of the iTRAQ results and our previously reported transcriptomics results. The aim of this research was to obtain the key DAPs and to identify the significantly enriched pathways involved in anther development and male sterility. These results may provide new insights into the molecular mechanism(s) underlying multiple-allele-inherited male sterility in Chinese cabbage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We have previously found that MYC regulates the changing ribosomal and proteostatic landscapes in mouse forebrain precursors at embryonic days E8. and E10. (before and after neural tube closure; NTC) (Chau et al., 2018). Here, we demonstrate parallel coordinated transcriptional changes in metabolic machinery during this same stage of forebrain specification. Progenitors showed striking mitochondrial structural changes transitioning from glycolytic cristae at E8., to more traditional mitochondria at E10.. Accordingly, glucose use shifted in progenitors such that E8. progenitors relied on , and after NTC increasingly used oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic shift was matched by changes in surrounding amniotic and cerebrospinal fluid proteomes. Importantly, these mitochondrial morphological shifts depend on MYC downregulation. Together, our findings demonstrate that metabolic shifting accompanies dynamic organelle and proteostatic remodeling of progenitor cells during the earliest stages of forebrain development.© 2019.

We aimed at identifying biomarkers for survival and response evaluated in lymphoid tissue metabolism in spleen and bone marrow before initiation of therapy.This retrospective study included 55 patients from two institutions who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT before anti-PD1. Parameters extracted were SUVmax, SUVmean, HISUV (SUV-based Heterogeneity Index), TMTV (total metabolic tumor volume), TLG (total lesion ), BLR (Bone marrow-to-Liver SUVmax ratio), and SLR (Spleen-to-Liver SUVmax ratio). Each parameter was dichotomized using the median as a threshold. Association with survival, best overall response (BOR), and transcriptomic analyses (NanoString assay) were evaluated using Cox prediction models, Wilcoxon tests, and Spearman's correlation, respectively.At 20.7 months median follow-up, 33 patients had responded, and 29 patients died. Median PFS and OS were 11.4 (95%CI 2.7-20.2) and 28. (95%CI 13.4-43.8) months. TMTV (>25cm), SLR (>0.77), and BLR (>0.79) correlated with shorter survival. High TMTV (>25 cm3), SLR (>0.77), and BLR (>0.79) correlated with shorter survival, with TMTV (HR PFS 2.2, p = 0.02, and HR OS 2., p = 0.02) and BLR (HR OS 2.3, p = 0.04) remaining significant in a multivariable analysis. Low TMTV and TLG correlated with BOR (p = 0.03). Increased glucose metabolism in bone marrow (BLR) was associated with transcriptomic profiles including regulatory T cell markers (p < 0.05).Low tumor burden correlates with survival and objective response while hematopoietic tissue metabolism correlates inversely with survival. These biomarkers should be further evaluated for potential clinical application.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31392276>β-Catenin/Tcf7l2-dependent transcriptional regulation of GLUT1 gene expression by Zic family proteins in colon cancer.</a></h1><p>The zinc finger of the cerebellum (ZIC) proteins has been implicated to function in normal tissue development. Recent studies have described the critical functions of Zic proteins in cancers and the potential tumor-suppressive functions in colon cancer development and progression. To elucidate the functional roles of Zic proteins in colorectal cancer, we knocked out the Zic5 gene and analyzed the chromatin localization pattern and transcriptional regulation of target gene expression. We found that Zic5 regulates glucose metabolism, and Zic5 knockout is accompanied by an increased glycolytic state and tolerance to a low-glucose condition. Furthermore, loss of β-catenin or TCF7l2 diminishes the chromatin binding of Zic5 globally. Our studies suggest that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has a strong influence on the function of Zic proteins and glucose metabolism in colorectal cancers through GLUT1. Interfering Wnt/-catenin-Zic5 axis-regulated aerobic  represents a potentially effective strategy to selectively target colon cancer cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154896>Proliferating tumor cells mimick glucose metabolism of mature human erythrocytes.</a></h1><p>Mature human erythrocytes are dependent on anerobic , i.e. catabolism (oxidation) of one glucose molecule to produce two ATP and two lactate molecules. Proliferating tumor cells mimick mature human erythrocytes to glycolytically generate two ATP molecules. They deliberately avoid or switch off their respiration, i.e. tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery and consequently dispense with the production of additional 36 ATP molecules from one glucose molecule. This phenomenon is named aerobic  or Warburg effect. The present review deals with the fate of a glucose molecule after entering a mature human erythrocyte or a proliferating tumor cell and describes why it is useful for a proliferating tumor cell to imitate a mature erythrocyte. Blood consisting of plasma and cellular components (99% of the cells are erythrocytes) may be regarded as a mobile organ, constantly exercising a direct interaction with other organs. Therefore, the use of drugs, which influences the biological activity of erythrocytes, has an immediate effect on the entire organism. : TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle; OXPHOS: oxidative phosphorylation; GSH: reduced state of glutathione; NFκB: Nuclear factor of kappa B; PKB (Akt): protein kinase B; NOS: nitric oxide synthase; IgG: immune globulin G; HS: hydrogen sulfide; slanDCs: Human 6-sulfo LacNAc-expressing dendritic cells; IL-8: interleukin-8; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; ROS: reactive oxygen species; PPP: pentose phosphate pathway; NADPH: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen; R5P: ribose--phophate; NAD: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; FAD: flavin adenine dinucleotide; O: superoxide anion; G6P: glucose 6-phosphate; HbO: Oxyhemoglobin; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GAP: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; 1,3-BPG: 1,3-bis-phosphoglycerate; 2,3-BPG: 2,3-bisphosphoglycerte; PGAM1: phosphoglycerate mutase 1; 3-PG: 3-phosphoglycerate; 2-PG: 2-phosphoglycerate; MIPP1: Multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase; mTORC1: mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; Ru5P: ribulose -phosphate; ox-PPP: oxidative branch of pentose phosphate pathway; PGK: phosphoglycerate kinase; IFN-γ: interferon-γ; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; STAT3: signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; Rheb: Ras homolog enriched in Brain; HO: hydrogen peroxide; ROOH: lipid peroxide; SOD: superoxide dismutase; MRC: mitochondrial respiratory chain; MbFe-O: methmyoglobin; RNR: ribonucleotide reductase; PRPP: phosphoribosylpyrophosphate; PP: pyrophosphate; GSSG: oxidized state of glutathione; non-ox-PPP: non-oxidative branch of pentose phosphate pathway; RPI: ribose--phosphate isomerase; RPE: ribulose -phosphate 3-epimerase; X5P: xylulose -phosphate; TK: transketolase; TA: transaldolase; F6P: fructose-6-phosphate; AR2: aldose reductase 2; SD: sorbitol dehydrogenase; HK: hexokinase; MG: mehtylglyoxal; DHAP: dihydroxyacetone phosphate; TILs: tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes; MCTs: monocarboxylate transporters; pHi: intracellular pH; Hif-1α: hypoxia-induced factor 1; NHE1: sodium/H (Na/H) antiporter 1; V-ATPase: vacuolar-type proton ATPase; CAIX: carbonic anhydrase; CO: carbon dioxide; HCO: bicarbonate; NBC: sodium/bicarbonate (Na/HCO) symporter; pHe: extracellular pH; GLUT-1: glucose transporter 1; PGK-1: phosphoglycerate kinase 1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667785>LncRNA LINC00857 regulates lung adenocarcinoma progression, apoptosis and  by targeting miR-1179/SPAG5 axis.</a></h1><p>Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), a member of non-coding RNA family with over 200 nucleotides in length, typically serves as an oncogene or tumor suppressor in tumor progression, such as cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis and . Recent studies manifested lncRNA LINC00857 was involved in cell cycle regulation of lung cancer. Due to complicated networks in tumorigenesis, the potential roles of LINC00857 underlying lung cancer progression still need further investigation. In this study, we explored the expression of LINC00857 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tissues and LUAD cell lines and found a dramatical upregulation of LINC00857 compared with the adjacent normal lung tissues and BEAS-2B cell line, respectively. Then, LINC00857 knockdown led to the cell proliferation and  was repressed, while the apoptosis was elevated in LUAD cell lines. Furthermore, we identified a direct interaction between LINC00857 and miR-1179 in LUAD cells using bioinformatic method and report assay. Finally, we evidenced LINC00857 promoted cell growth and  and repressed apoptosis via sponging miR-1179 and further regulating sperm-associated antigen  (SPAG5) expression in LUAD cell lines. Hence, our results authenticated that lncRNA LINC00857 regulated the cell proliferation,  and apoptosis of LUAD cells mainly through targeting the miR-1179/SPAG5 axis, which might be a novel insight into lung cancer progression and provided a potential target for clinical treatment of LUAD patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31568988>Systematic screening of protein-coding gene expression identified HMMR as a potential independent indicator of unfavorable survival in patients with papillary muscle-invasive bladder cancer.</a></h1><p>Papillary and non-papillary are two histological patterns of bladder carcinogenesis and are considered as dual-track oncogenic pathways, which have different genetic alterations. The TCGA-bladder cancer (BLCA) database contains clinicopathological, genomic and survival data from over 400 muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients. In this study, using data from this database, we performed a systematic screening of gene expression to identify the protein-coding gene that might have prognostic value in papillary and non-papillary muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). The data of patients with primary MIBC in TCGA-BLCA was acquired from the UCSC Xena project (http://xena.ucsc.edu) for re-analysis. By setting |log2 fold change|≥2 and adjusted p value <0.01 as the screening criteria, we found 751 significantly dysregulated genes, including 183 overexpressed and 568 downregulated genes. HMMR was identified as a potential prognostic marker with unique expression. Multivariate analysis showed that its expression was an independent prognostic indicator of shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (HR: 1.400, 95%CI: 1.021-1.920, p = 0.037) in the papillary subtype. ENST00000393915.8 and ENST00000358715.3, two transcripts that contain all 18 exons and encode the full length of HMMR, were significantly upregulated in cancer tissues compared with normal bladder tissues. None of the 17 CpG sites in its DNA locus was relevant to HMMR expression. 26/403 (6.%) MIBC cases had HMMR gene-level amplification, which was associated with upregulated HMMR expression compared with the copy-neutral and deletion groups. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in papillary MIBC found that the high HMMR expression group was associated with upregulated genes enriched in multiple gene sets with well-established role in BC development, including G2M checkpoint, E2 F Targets, Myc Targets V1, Myc Targets V2 and . Based on these findings, we infer that HMMR expression might be a specific prognostic marker in terms of PFS in papillary MIBC. DNA amplification might be an important mechanism of its elevation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

Although transsphenoidal surgery are able to achieve extensive tumor removal, the rate of recurrence ranges from  to 20% depending on the different subtype. Further understanding of these tumors is needed to develop novel strategies to improve the prognosis of patients. But their metabolic characteristics are largely unknown.We used metabolomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approaches to systematically investigate eight subtypes of pituitary adenomas and normal pituitary glands. By blocking IDH2, we investigate IDH2 play an inhibitory role in GH tumor cell growth and tumor secretion.We found that all of the pituitary adenomas displayed downregulated glucose metabolism and  compared to normal tissues. Together with the differences in amino acids and fatty acids, we categorized these tumors into three clusters. We then re-established the reprogrammed metabolic flux in pituitary adenomas based on multiomic analyses. Take growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas as an example, we revealed that IDH2 is a key player in the reprogrammed metabolism of such tumors. By blocking IDH2, we confirmed that IDH2 is a potential target for the inhibition of tumor cell growth and tumor secretion.Our study first uncovered the metabolic landscape of pituitary adenomas and demonstrated a possible way to inhibit tumor growth by regulating aberrant metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672987>Rewiring carbon metabolism in yeast for high level production of aromatic chemicals.</a></h1><p>The production of bioactive plant compounds using microbial hosts is considered a safe, cost-competitive and scalable approach to their production. However, microbial production of some compounds like aromatic amino acid (AAA)-derived chemicals, remains an outstanding metabolic engineering challenge. Here we present the construction of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae platform strain able to produce high levels of p-coumaric acid, an AAA-derived precursor for many commercially valuable chemicals. This is achieved through engineering the AAA biosynthesis pathway, introducing a phosphoketalose-based pathway to divert glycolytic flux towards erythrose 4-phosphate formation, and optimizing carbon distribution between  and the AAA biosynthesis pathway by replacing the promoters of several important genes at key nodes between these two pathways. This results in a maximum p-coumaric acid titer of 12. g L and a maximum yield on glucose of 154.9 mg g.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340724>Head and Neck Cancer Immunotherapy beyond the Checkpoint Blockade.</a></h1><p>The success of immune checkpoint receptor blockade has brought exciting promises for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). While patients who respond to checkpoint inhibitors tend to develop a durable response, <15% of patients with HNSCC respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors, underscoring the critical need to alleviate cancer resistance to immunotherapy. Major advances have been made to elucidate the intrinsic and adaptive resistance mechanisms to immunotherapy. Central genomic events in HNSCC have been found to possess previously unknown roles in suppressing immune sensing. Such inhibitory function affects both the innate and adaptive arms of tumor-specific immunity. While checkpoint blockade effectively reinvigorates adaptive T-cell responses, additional targeting of the oncogenic inhibitors of innate immune sensing likely informs a novel and potent strategy for immune priming. This review discusses the recent advances on the identification of key HNSCC oncogenes that impair antitumor immunity and emerging immune-priming approaches that sensitize poorly immunogenic HNSCCs to checkpoint blockade. These approaches include but are not limited to cancer vaccine systems utilizing novel type I interferon agonists as immune adjuvants, radiation, DNA damage-inducing agents, and metabolic reprogramming. The goal of these multipronged approaches is to expand tumor-specific effector T-cells, break checkpoint receptor-mediated tolerance, and metabolically support sustained T-cell activation. The translation of therapeutics that reverses oncogenic inhibition of immune sensing requires thorough characterization of the HNSCC regulators of innate immune sensors, development of additional immunocompetent HNSCC mouse models, as well as engineering of more robust immune adjuvant delivery systems. Built on the success of checkpoint blockade, validation of novel immune-priming approaches holds key promises to expand the pool of responders to immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31166954>Muscle fiber hypertrophy in response to 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training in trained young men is largely attributed to sarcoplasmic hypertrophy.</a></h1><p>Cellular adaptations that occur during skeletal muscle hypertrophy in response to high-volume resistance training are not well-characterized. Therefore, we sought to explore how actin, myosin, sarcoplasmic protein, mitochondrial, and glycogen concentrations were altered in individuals that exhibited mean skeletal muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) hypertrophy following 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training. Thirty previously resistance-trained, college-aged males (mean ± standard deviation: 21±2 years, ±3 training years) had vastus lateralis (VL) muscle biopsies obtained prior to training (PRE), at week 3 (W3), and at week 6 (W6). Muscle tissue from 15 subjects exhibiting PRE to W6 VL mean fCSA increases ranging from 320-1600 μm2 was further interrogated using various biochemical and histological assays as well as proteomic analysis. Seven of these individuals donated a VL biopsy after refraining from training 8 days following the last training session (W7) to determine how deloading affected biomarkers. The 15 fCSA hypertrophic responders experienced a +23% increase in mean fCSA from PRE to W6 (p<0.001) and, while muscle glycogen concentrations remained unaltered, citrate synthase activity levels decreased by 24% (p<0.001) suggesting mitochondrial volume decreased. Interestingly, repeated measures ANOVAs indicated that p-values approached statistical significance for both myosin and actin (p = 0.052 and p = 0.055, respectively), and forced post hoc tests indicated concentrations for both proteins decreased ~30% from PRE to W6 (p<0.05 for each target). Phalloidin-actin staining similarly revealed actin concentrations per fiber decreased from PRE to W6. Proteomic analysis of the sarcoplasmic fraction from PRE to W6 indicated 40 proteins were up-regulated (p<0.05), KEGG analysis indicated that the /gluconeogenesis pathway was upregulated (FDR sig. <0.001), and DAVID indicated that the following functionally-annotated pathways were upregulated (FDR value <0.05): a)  (8 proteins), b) acetylation (23 proteins), c) gluconeogenesis ( proteins) and d) cytoplasm (20 proteins). At W7, sarcoplasmic protein concentrations remained higher than PRE (+66%, p<0.05), and both actin and myosin concentrations remained lower than PRE (~-50%, p<0.05). These data suggest that short-term high-volume resistance training may: a) reduce muscle fiber actin and myosin protein concentrations in spite of increasing fCSA, and b) promote sarcoplasmic expansion coincident with a coordinated up-regulation of sarcoplasmic proteins involved in  and other metabolic processes related to ATP generation. Interestingly, these effects seem to persist up to 8 days following training.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667811>Glycogenolysis in Cerebral Cortex During Sensory Stimulation, Acute Hypoglycemia, and Exercise: Impact on Astrocytic Energetics, Aerobic , and Astrocyte-Neuron Interactions.</a></h1><p>Most glycogen in cerebral cortex is located in astrocytes, and the importance of glycogenolysis for critical functions, including neurotransmission and memory consolidation, is strongly supported by many studies. However, specific mechanisms through which glycogen sustains essential functions remain to be established by rigorous, quantitative studies. Cerebral cortical glycogen concentrations are in the range of 10-12 μmol/g in carefully-handled animals, and the calculated rate of glycogenolysis (CMR) during sensory stimulation is approximately 60% that of glucose utilization (CMR) by all cells, with lower rates during acute hypoglycemia and exercise to exhaustion. CMR is at least fourfold higher when the volume fraction of astrocytes is taken into account. Inclusion of glycogen consumed during sensory stimulation in calculation of the oxygen-glucose index (OGI = CMR/CMR, which has a theoretical maximum of 6 when no other substrates are metabolized) reduces OGI from .0 to 2.8. Thus, at least 53% of the carbohydrate is not oxidized, suggesting that glycogen mobilization supports astrocytic , not neuronal oxidation of glycogen-derived lactate that would cause OGI to exceed 6. Failure of glycogenolysis to dilute the specific activity of lactate formed from blood-borne [6-C]glucose indicates compartmentation of glycolytic metabolism of glucose and glycogen and the rapid release from cerebral cortex of glycogen-derived lactate. Together, these findings invalidate the conclusion by others that glycogen-derived lactate is a major fuel for neurons during neurotransmission, memory consolidation, and exercise to exhaustion. Alternative mechanisms, including glucose sparing for neurons, are presented as testable explanations for data interpreted as lactate shuttling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613799>Targeting tumor-intrinsic hexosamine biosynthesis sensitizes pancreatic cancer to anti-PD1 therapy.</a></h1><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is considered to be a highly immunosuppressive and heterogenous neoplasm. Despite improved knowledge regarding the genetic background of the tumor and better understanding of the tumor microenvironment, immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (targeting CTLA4, PD1, PDL1) has not been very successful against PDAC. The robust desmoplastic stroma, along with an extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) that is rich in hyaluronan, plays an integral role in this immune evasion. Hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP), a shunt pathway of , is a metabolic node in cancer cells that can promote survival pathways on one hand and influence the hyaluronan synthesis in the ECM on the other. The rate-limiting enzyme of the pathway, glutamine-fructose amidotransferase (GFAT1), uses glutamine and fructose 6-phosphate to eventually synthesize UDP-GlcNAc. In the current manuscript, we targeted this glutamine-utilizing enzyme by a small molecule glutamine analog (6-diazo--oxo-L-norleucine or DON). Our results showed that DON decreased the self-renewal potential and metastatic ability of tumor cell. Further, treatment with DON decreased hyaluronan and collagen in the tumor microenvironment, leading to an extensive remodeling of the ECM, and an increased infiltration CD8+ T-cells. Additionally, treatment with DON sensitized pancreatic tumors to anti-PD1 therapy resulting in tumor regression and prolonged survival.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31358786>Prognostic Significance of Metabolic Parameters and Textural Features on F-FDG PET/CT in Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of Breast.</a></h1><p>To investigate the prognostic significance of metabolic parameters and texture analysis on F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) in patients with breast invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), from August 2005 to May 2015, IDC patients who had undergone pre-treatment FDG PET/CT were enrolled. The metabolic parameters, including maximal standardized uptake value of breast tumor (SUVbt) and ipsilateral axillary lymph node (SUVln), metabolic tumor volume (MTVbt) and total lesion  (TLGbt) of breast tumor, whole-body MTV (MTVwb) and whole-body TLG (TLGwb) were recorded. Nine textural features of tumor (four co-occurrence matrices and five SUV-based statistics) were measured. The prognostic significance of above parameters and clinical factors was assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Thirty-five patients were enrolled. Patients with low and high MTVwb had -year progression-free survival (PFS) of 81.0 and 14.3% (p < 0.0001). The -year overall survival for low and high MTVwb was 88.% and 43.6% (p = 0.0005). Multivariate analyses showed MTVwb was an independent prognostic factor for PFS (HR: 8.29, 95% CI: 2.17-31.64, p = 0.0020). The SUV, TLG and textural features were not independently predictive.

The inverted optical microscope was used to observe the cell growth, CCK 8 was used to detect the cell vitality. The appropriate metformin doses (0, 10, 20 and 30 mmol/L) and the best time (48 h) were selected for subsequent experiments. The flow cytometer with Annexin V-FITC /PI doulde staining was used to detect apoptosis; the glucose detection kit and lactate detection kit were used to detect glucose consumption and lactate production; fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect -related gene expression, and Western blot was used to detect protein expression.Metformin inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner (r=0.92), and the relative survival in the 30 mmol/L group was as low as 19.84% at 72 h.

Compared with the control group, the glucose consumption and lactate secretion of K562 cells treated with metformin were significantly reduced (P<0.05), and showed a dose-dependent effect(r=0.94,r=0.93,respectively). Metformin inhibited the expression of GLUT1, LDHA, ALDOA, PDK1, and PGK1 genes of K562 cells (P<0.05) showing a dose-dependent manner(r=0.83，r=0.80，r=0.72，r=0.76，r=0.73,respectively).

Glucose regulates the expression of glucose permease genes in yeasts through signaling pathways dependent on plasma membrane glucose sensors. In the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, sufficient levels of glucose induction of the low-affinity glucose transporter RAG1 gene also depends on a functional , suggesting additional intracellular signaling. We have found that the expression of RAG1 gene is also induced by hypoxia in the presence of glucose, indicating that glucose and oxygen signaling pathways are interconnected. In this study we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying this crosstalk. By analyzing RAG1 expression in various K. lactis mutants, we found that the bHLH transcriptional activator Sck1 is required for the hypoxic induction of RAG1 gene. The RAG1 promoter region essential for its hypoxic induction was identified by promoter deletion experiments. Taken together, these results show that the RAG1 glucose permease gene is synergistically induced by hypoxia and glucose and highlighted a novel role for the transcriptional activator Sck1 as a key mediator in this mechanism.© FEMS 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31233683>[Effect of quercetin on the expression of the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism genes in the liver of rats with genetic].</a></h1><p>Quercetin (Q; 3,3',4',,7-pentahydroxyflavone) is considered as a promising component of specialized products for the correction of metabolic disorders in obesity and metabolic syndrome. At the same time, the results of evaluating the clinical efficacy of Q are ambiguous, and the mechanisms of its influence on lipid and carbohydrate-energy metabolism are not well understood.  of the work was to study the effect of quercetin (Q 3,3',4',,7-pentahydroxyflavone) on the expression of key  and lipogenesis enzymes' genes in Zucker-Leprfa (Z) rats characterized by hereditary obesity, compared to «wild-type» Wistar (W) rats. . 24 male Z rats and 32 male W rats aged 8-10 weeks were used. Animals of each line were divided into 4 groups of equal numbers. For 62 days the animals of the first groups (controls) received a balanced diet according to AIN93M, the seconds - the same diet with Q added in a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight. Animals of the third groups received a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet (HFCD) with fat 30% by weight and with the replacement of drinking water with a 20% solution of fructose, the fourths groups - the same diet and supplementation with Q. After removing animals from the experiment, expression levels of liver carbohydrate and lipid metabolism genes Khk, Gck, Pklr, Acaca, Fasn, Scd, Srebf1, Mlxipl, Ppara and Pparg were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with reverse transcription using Actb and Gapdh as reference genes. The levels of triglycerides, total and HDL cholesterol, lipolytic activity and immunoreactive leptin were determined in plasma. . When comparing two animal lines, a significantly higher level of expression of Ppara, Pparg, Mlxipl, Acaca, Fasn, Scd was shown in Z rats compared to W rats, which is consistent with the development of dyslipidemia in the first ones and elevated levels of leptin under both types of diets used. The addition of Q caused in W rats a decrease in the expression of Scd, Mlxipl, Khk and Gck, more pronounced on the background of HFCD whereas in Z rats there were no similar effects, or they had the opposite direction. In addition, in Z rats, consumption of Q led to increased expression of Pklr, which was not observed in W rats. . The modulating effect of Q on the expression of key genes of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism enzymes significantly differs in wild-type W rats and mutant Z rats with hereditary obesity, and this difference appears to be potentiated by the consumption of excess fat and fructose.Copyright© GEOTAR-Media Publishing Group.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31350330>Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) modifies energy metabolism via ' AMP-activated protein kinase signalling in malignant cells.</a></h1><p>Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) is an adverse biomarker across many malignancies. Using K562 cells engineered to have high or low CIP2A expression, we show that high CIP2A levels significantly bias cellular energy production towards oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) rather than . Mass spectrometric analysis of CIP2A interactors and isobaric tagging for relative and absolute protein quantitation (ITRAQ) experiments identified many associated proteins, several of which co-vary with CIP2A level. Many of these CIP2A associating and co-varying proteins are involved in energy metabolism including OXPHOS, or in ' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling, and manipulating AMPK activity mimics the effects of low/high CIP2A on OXPHOS. These effects are dependent on the availability of nutrients, driven by metabolic changes caused by CIP2A. CIP2A level did not affect starvation-induced AMPK phosphorylation of Unc-51 autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK-1) at Ser555, but autophagy activity correlated with an increase in AMPK activity, to suggest that some AMPK processes are uncoupled by CIP2A, likely via its inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The data demonstrate that AMPK mediates this novel CIP2A effect on energy generation in malignant cells.© 2019 The Author(s).

Aerobic  is one of its metabolic hallmarks. Blocking  is a novel therapeutic option for liver fibrosis. This study investigated the effects of costunolide, a natural product demonstrated to have hepatoprotective effects, on HSC activation and .Primary HSCs were isolated from rats and cultured through  to 6 passages. Cell viability, activation markers, and glycolytic metabolism were examined in primary HSCs using various cellular and molecular approaches.At 30 μM, costunolide reduced the viability of HSCs and inhibited the expression of α-smooth muscle actin and collagen I, two key markers of HSC activation. It also decreased glucose uptake and consumption, and reduced the intracellular levels of lactate in HSCs. At 10 mM, the  inhibitor 2-DG had a similar impact to costunolide at 30 μM: it significantly downregulated the expression of HSC activation markers. The combination of the two compounds produced more remarkable effects. Furthermore, costunolide repressed the expression and activity of hexokinase 2 (HK2), a pivotal rate-limiting enzyme that regulates . However, overexpression of HK2 via plasmid transfection significantly reversed the costunolide-mediated downregulation of activation markers in HSCs, indicating that suppression of HK2 was required for costunolide to inhibit -associated HSC activation.Our results show that costunolide can suppress HSC activation, and this is associated with inhibition of HK2, which blocks aerobic .

It is now evident that mitochondria are involved in the malignant transformation, cell proliferation, aggression and metastatic behavior of prostate cancer (PC). Recent comprehensive analysis of the mitochondrial oncobioenergetic (MOB) profile of PC cells using microplate-based high resolution respirometry has clearly demonstrated that characteristic MOB alterations occur at different stages of PC development. Additionally, studies have reported that modification of the MOB profile significantly inhibits the growth of malignant cells. This observation suggests that dynamic alterations in the MOB function are a critical component in the development of malignant disease of the prostate. Therefore, quantification of MOB function may be a good marker for the prediction of tumor stage. Future studies may develop novel approaches to measure oncobioenergetics of tumors with minimal invasive procedures effectively in men to determine the general prostate health and tumor staging, and to predict whether a tumor will proceed to malignancy in patients. Additionally, since PC is a slow growing tumor, modulating the MOB profile at specific stages of tumor development may be a novel approach to treat or prevent PC.Copyright: © Vayalil et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31178969>Antistress Effects of  Decoction on Restraint-Stressed Mice Revealed by H NMR-Based Metabolomics and Biochemistry Analysis.</a></h1><p> decoction (SHXXD), composed of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Coptidis Rhizoma, and Scutellariae Radix, is a representative antipyretic and detoxifying prescription in traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, we investigated the antistress effects and underlying mechanisms of  decoction (SHXXD) on restraint-stressed mice by H NMR-based metabolomics combined with biochemistry assay. A total of 48 male mice ( weeks old, 18-22 g) were divided randomly into 6 groups ( = 8), including the normal group, restraint-stressed group, vitamin C group (positive drug, 17 mg/kg), and 3-dosage groups of SHXXD (200, 400, and 800 mg/kg). The stress model was induced by restraining mice in a polypropylene centrifuge tube for 6 h every day. The rotarod test was performed, and several biochemical indicators were measured. Moreover, other 24 animals were divided into 3 groups ( = 8) including the normal group, restraint-stressed group, and SHXXD group (800 mg/kg) for H NMR-based metabolomics analysis. Our results showed that SHXXD significantly increased the rotarod time, thymus index, spleen index, and the levels of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and interleukin- (IL-) 2, but decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1, tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) , corticosterone (CORT), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in restraint-stressed mice. Moreover, the contents of eight endogenous metabolites that were changed by restraint stress were significantly reversed by SHXXD. The results of both metabolomics and biochemical analysis indicated that SHXXD (800 mg/kg, p.o.) could improve the biochemical changes and metabolic disorders in restraint-stressed mice by antioxidation and anti-inflammation, enhancing the body's immune function and restoring several disturbed metabolic pathways (i.e., lipid metabolism,  and gluconeogenesis, inflammatory injury, and energy metabolism). Taken together, these results indicated that SHXXD has a potential antistress effect in restraint-stressed mice and could be considered as a candidate drug for stress-related disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31509426>Prognostic Value of the Volumetric Parameters of Dual-Time-Point F-FDG PET/CT in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Definitive Radiation Therapy.</a></h1><p> The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the volumetric parameters of dual-time-point imaging (DTPI) with F-FDG PET (DTPI FDG PET) in predicting the prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with definitive radiation therapy (RT).  The records of consecutive patients who received definitive RT for NSCLC from April 2010 to April 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Pretreatment DTPI FDG PET images were routinely obtained as part of the PET/CT examination. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion  (TLG) of the primary tumor (SUV-T, MTV-T, and TLG-T, respectively) and those of the primary tumor and lymph nodes (N) combined (SUV-TN, MTV-TN, and TLG-TN, respectively) were used as variables, and the percentage change in these parameters (change in SUV [ΔSUV], change in MTV [ΔMTV], and change in TLG [ΔTLG]) on DTPI FDG PET were analyzed.  Of the 118 patients identified and reviewed, 59 met the study eligibility criteria. After a median follow-up of 23.3 months, the 3-year local control rate (LCR) and disease-specific survival rates were 53.% and 45.0%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, significant predictors of LCR were TLG-T and change in TLG-TN (ΔTLG-TN), and significant predictors of disease-specific survival were adjuvant chemotherapy, treatment response, TLG-T, and change in TLG-T (ΔTLG-T). Low percentage changes in ΔTLG (< 41.0% for ΔTLG-T and < 32.0% for ΔTLG-TN) correlated with poor LCR and disease-specific survival. SUV and MTV were not significant predictors of both LCR and disease-specific survival.  TLG and ΔTLG were significant prognostic factors in patients with NSCLC treated with definitive RT. In particular, a relatively low ΔTLG resulted in poor outcomes in terms of LCR and disease-specific survival.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564806>A FDG PET/CT-based volume parameter is a predictor of overall survival in patients with local advanced gastric cancer.</a></h1><p>The present study investigated the prognosis value of preoperative fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients with local advanced gastric cancer (LAGC).In total, 144 patients [median age 63 (range: 48-80) years old] with LAGC underwentF-FDG PET/CT prior to any treatment. The maximum standardized uptake values (SUV), mean standardized uptake values (SUV), metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion  (TLG) of the primary lesion were measured on PET/CT and correlated with clinicopathological features and survival.Significant differences in SUV, SUV, MTV and TLG were found according to Lauren's classification, histologic grade and T category (P<0.05). During the 26.-month follow-up, 51 (35.4%) patients died and 70 (48.6%) exhibited disease progression. The optimal thresholds of MTV and TLG were 15.1 cm and 47.3 cm, respectively. The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with high TLG values were 30% and 38% compared to 38% and 47% for low TLG values, respectively (P<0.05). Univariate and multifactor analyses demonstrated that lymph node metastasis and T stage were independent prognostic factors for PFS; T stage, histologic grade and TLG were independent prognostic factors for OS (P<0.05).

Despite the significant effect of RH on hippocampal function, the underlying mechanisms are currently unknown. Our goal was to determine the effect of RH exposure on hippocampal metabolism in treated streptozotocin-diabetic rats.Hyperglycemia was corrected by insulin pellet implantation. Insulin-treated diabetic (ITD) rats were exposed to mild/moderate RH once a day for  consecutive days.The effect of RH on hippocampal metabolism revealed 65 significantly altered metabolites in the RH group compared with controls. Several significant differences in metabolite levels belonging to major pathways (eg, Krebs cycle, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid metabolism) were discovered in RH-exposed ITD rats when compared to a control group. Key glycolytic enzymes including hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase were affected by RH exposure.Our results demonstrate that the exposure to RH leads to metabolomics alterations in the hippocampus of insulin-treated streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Understanding how RH affects hippocampal metabolism may help attenuate the adverse effects of RH on hippocampal functions.© 2019 The Authors.

The information available on the molecular mechanisms regulating tuber development by CKs remains largely unclear. Physiological results initially indicated that low 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) concentration (3 mg l ) advanced the tuberization beginning time and promoted tuber formation. A comparative proteomics approach was applied to investigate the proteome change of tuber development by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in vitro, subjected to exogenous BAP treatments (0, 3, 6 and 13 mg l ). Quantitative image analysis showed a total of 83 protein spots with significantly altered abundance (>2.-fold, P < 0.05), and 55 differentially abundant proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. Among these proteins, 22 proteins exhibited up-regulation with the increase of exogenous BAP concentration, and 31 proteins were upregulated at 3 mg l BAP whereas being downregulated at higher BAP concentrations. These proteins were involved in metabolism and bioenergy, storage, redox homeostasis, cell defense and rescue, transcription and translation, chaperones, signaling and transport. The favorable effects of low BAP concentrations on tuber development were found in various cellular processes, mainly including the stimulation of starch and storage protein accumulation, the enhancement of the  pathway and ATP synthesis, the cellular homeostasis maintenance, the activation of pathogen defense, the higher efficiency of transcription and translation, as well as the enhanced metabolite transport. However, higher BAP concentration, especially 13 mg l , showed disadvantageous effects. The proposed hypothetical model would explain the interaction of these proteins associated with CK-induced tuber development in vitro.© 2019 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31217327>Allosteric, transcriptional and post-translational control of mitochondrial energy metabolism.</a></h1><p>The heart is the organ with highest energy turnover rate (per unit weight) in our body. The heart relies on its flexible and powerful catabolic capacity to continuously generate large amounts of ATP utilizing many energy substrates including fatty acids, carbohydrates (glucose and lactate), ketones and amino acids. The normal health mainly utilizes fatty acids (40-60%) and glucose (20-40%) for ATP production while ketones and amino acids have a minor contribution (10-15% and 1-2%, respectively). Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is the major contributor to cardiac energy production (95%) while cytosolic  has a marginal contribution (%). The heart can dramatically and swiftly switch between energy-producing pathways and/or alter the share from each of the energy substrates based on cardiac workload, availability of each energy substrate and neuronal and hormonal activity. The heart is equipped with a highly sophisticated and powerful mitochondrial machinery which synchronizes cardiac energy production from different substrates and orchestrates the rate of ATP production to accommodate its contractility demands. This review discusses mitochondrial cardiac energy metabolism and how it is regulated. This includes a discussion on the allosteric control of cardiac energy metabolism by short-chain coenzyme A esters, including malonyl CoA and its effect on cardiac metabolic preference. We also discuss the transcriptional level of energy regulation and its role in the maturation of cardiac metabolism after birth and cardiac adaptability for different metabolic conditions and energy demands. The role post-translational modifications, namely phosphorylation, acetylation, malonylation, succinylation and glutarylation, play in regulating mitochondrial energy metabolism is also discussed.© 2019 The Author(s).

The beneficial actions of metformin have been found even beyond diabetes management and it has been considered as one of the most promising drugs that could potentially slow down aging. Surprisingly, the effect of metformin on brain function and metabolism has been less explored given that brain almost exclusively uses glucose as substrate for energy metabolism. We determined the effect of metformin on locomotor and cognitive function in normoglycemic mice. Metformin enhanced locomotor and balance performance, while induced anxiolytic effect and impaired cognitive function upon chronic treatment. We conducted  assays and metabolomics analysis in mice to evaluate metformin's action on the brain metabolism. Metformin decreased ATP level and activated AMPK pathway in mouse hippocampus. Metformin inhibited oxidative phosphorylation and elevated  by inhibiting mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH)  at therapeutic doses.

Several PET/CT parameters grading tumor biology including maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), total lesion  (TLG), its equivalent (total hypoxic lesion [TLH] and total proliferative lesion [TLP]), and heterogeneity (area under the curve-cumulative SUV histogram) for the primary tumor were compared.All patients showed increased uptake of F-FDG in primary tumor, ranging from 2.29 to 14.89 SUV. Respectively, SUV values for F-FLT ranged from 0.93 to 16.11 and for F-FMISO 0.36-4.07.

Along with the development of new and effective therapies, improved outcomes in patients with multiple myeloma have increased the interest in minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring. However, the considerable heterogeneity of immunophenotypic and molecular markers of myeloma cells has limited its clinical application. -Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a natural compound in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Following ALA treatment, tumor cells preferentially accumulate porphyrins because of the differential activities of aerobic , known as Warburg effect. Among various porphyrins, protoporphyrine IX is a strong photosensitizer; thus, ALA-based photodynamic diagnosis has been widely used in various solid cancers. Here, the feasibility of flow cytometry-based photodynamic detection of MRD was tested in multiple myeloma. Among various human cell lines of hematological malignancies, including K562 erythroleukemia, Jurkat T-cell leukemia, Nalm6 pre-B cell leukemia, KG1a myeloid leukemia, and U937 monocytic leukemia, human myeloma cell line, KMS18, and OPM2 abundantly expressed ALA transporters, such as SLC36A1 and SLC15A2, and 1 mM ALA treatment for 24 h resulted in nearly 100% porphyrin fluorescence expression, which could be competitively inhibited by ALA transport with gamma-aminobutyric acid. Titration studies revealed that the lowest ALA concentration required to achieve nearly 100% porphyrin fluorescence in KMS18 cells was 0.25 mM, with an incubation period of 2 h. Under these conditions, incubation of primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells resulted in only 1.8 % of the cells exhibiting porphyrin fluorescence.

A switch from  to mitochondrial respiration drives these cells toward differentiation, but the mechanisms that control this switch are poorly defined. Studies have demonstrated that kidney formation is highly dependent on oxygen concentration, which is largely regulated by von Hippel-Lindau (VHL; a protein component of a ubiquitin ligase complex) and hypoxia-inducible factors (a family of transcription factors activated by hypoxia).To explore VHL as a regulator defining nephron progenitor self-renewal versus differentiation, we bred Six2-TGC mice with VHL mice to generate mice with a conditional deletion of  from Six2 nephron progenitors.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the image quality, lesion detection rate, and quantitative values of fxPET compared with conventional bismuth germanium oxide (BGO)-based PET/CT without time-of-flight capability.Fifty-nine patients underwent whole-body (WB) PET/CT scans approximately 1 h after injection of 2-deoxy-2-[F]fluoro-D-glucose, followed by the fxPET scans with detectors located above and below the patients (layout A) and with detectors closer to the patients (layout B). Two readers assessed the image quality using a 4-point grade for each layout and reached a consensus. We evaluated the differences and/or correlations between fxPET and WB PET/CT, including the lesion detection rates, the standardized uptake value (SUV), the metabolic tumor volume (MTV), the total lesion  (TLG), the tumor-to-normal liver ratio (TLR), and the background liver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).The image quality of layout B was better than layout A (p < 0.0001). Of 184 lesions, the detection rate of layout B was significantly higher than WB PET/CT (p = 0.041), while the detection rate of layout A was comparable to WB PET/CT. The SUVmax/mean/peak were larger, and the MTVs were smaller in fxPET than WB PET/CT, especially in the lesions smaller than 2 cm (p < 0.01). The SUVmax/mean/peak, the MTVs and the TLGs of fxPET had significant positive correlations with WB PET/CT (p < 0.0001). The TLRs were significantly larger (p < 0.0001), but the background SNRs were significantly lower in fxPET than WB PET/CT (p < 0.05).The fxPET system yielded reasonable image quality and quantitative accuracy.

Upon injection, LPS causes activation of microglia and astrocytes, whose metabolism alters to favor . Assessing in vivo neuroinflammation and its modulation following therapy remains challenging, and new noninvasive methods allowing for longitudinal monitoring would be highly valuable. Hyperpolarized (HP)  C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a promising technique for assessing in vivo metabolism. In addition to applications in oncology, the most commonly used probe of [1- C] pyruvate has shown potential in assessing neuroinflammation-linked metabolism in mouse models of multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury. Here, we aimed to investigate LPS-induced neuroinflammatory changes using HP [1- C] pyruvate and HP  C urea. 2D chemical shift imaging following simultaneous intravenous injection of HP [1- C] pyruvate and HP  C urea was performed at baseline (day 0) and at days 3 and 7 post-intracranial injection of LPS (n = 6) or saline (n = ). Immunofluorescence (IF) analyses were performed for Iba1 (resting and activated microglia/macrophages), GFAP (resting and reactive astrocytes) and CD68 (activated microglia/macrophages). A significant increase in HP [1- C] lactate production was observed at days 3 and 7 following injection, in the injected (ipsilateral) side of the LPS-treated mouse brain, but not in either the contralateral side or saline-injected animals. HP  C lactate/pyruvate ratio, without and with normalization to urea, was also significantly increased in the ipsilateral LPS-injected brain at 7 days compared with baseline. IF analyses showed a significant increase in CD68 and GFAP staining at 3 days, followed by increased numbers of Iba1 and GFAP positive cells at 7 days post-LPS injection. In conclusion, we can detect LPS-induced changes in the mouse brain using HP  C MRS, in alignment with increased numbers of microglia/macrophages and astrocytes. This study demonstrates that HP  C spectroscopy has substantial potential for providing noninvasive information on neuroinflammation.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31367038>Lysine harvesting is an antioxidant strategy and triggers underground polyamine metabolism.</a></h1><p>Both single and multicellular organisms depend on anti-stress mechanisms that enable them to deal with sudden changes in the environment, including exposure to heat and oxidants. Central to the stress response are dynamic changes in metabolism, such as the transition from the  to the pentose phosphate pathway-a conserved first-line response to oxidative insults. Here we report a second metabolic adaptation that protects microbial cells in stress situations. The role of the yeast polyamine transporter Tpo1p in maintaining oxidant resistance is unknown. However, a proteomic time-course experiment suggests a link to lysine metabolism. We reveal a connection between polyamine and lysine metabolism during stress situations, in the form of a promiscuous enzymatic reaction in which the first enzyme of the polyamine pathway, Spe1p, decarboxylates lysine and forms an alternative polyamine, cadaverine. The reaction proceeds in the presence of extracellular lysine, which is taken up by cells to reach concentrations up to one hundred times higher than those required for growth. Such extensive harvest is not observed for the other amino acids, is dependent on the polyamine pathway and triggers a reprogramming of redox metabolism. As a result, NADPH-which would otherwise be required for lysine biosynthesis-is channelled into glutathione metabolism, leading to a large increase in glutathione concentrations, lower levels of reactive oxygen species and increased oxidant tolerance. Our results show that nutrient uptake occurs not only to enable cell growth, but when the nutrient availability is favourable it also enables cells to reconfigure their metabolism to preventatively mount stress protection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31347673>Changes in cecum microbial community in response to total sulfur amino acid (TSAA: DL-methionine) in antibiotic-free and supplemented poultry birds.</a></h1><p>The effect of essential total sulfur amino acids (TSAA) like methionine and cysteine on the cecal microbiome of broilers was investigated at 2 different time points (days 21 and 42) of broiler rearing. A total of 360-day-old Cobb male broiler chicks were randomly distributed to 6 dietary treatments in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement, with 2 levels of antibiotic growth promoters (AGP: 0 and 0.05%) and 3 levels of TSAA (DL-methionine) either for starter (0.7, 0.8, and 0.9%) or finisher chicks (0.52, 0.62, and 0.72%), labeled as diets 1 to 6. Cecal digesta from each replicate (n = 10) were sampled on days 21 and 42. DNA was extracted for the amplification of the V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes and subjected to Illumina sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses were performed using QIIME, Mothur, and ad hoc tools and functional profiles of the inferred metagenome were analyzed using PICRUST. Statistical difference was determined by 2-way ANOVA and PERMANOVA. Clustering of cecal communities using PCoA showed clear separation of microbial communities based on age (P < 0.05) of birds and between low and medium/ high levels of TSAA (DL-methionine). At day 21, bacterial richness and diversity were higher than at day 42 where Clostridium cluster XI and Lactobacillus were found most abundant. No variability in taxonomic richness at the genus level was observed with AGP and DL-methionine supplementation. Interbird variation for richness was greater at day 42 compared to day 21. The mean fold difference of richness was greater (1. mean fold) with diets 1 and 6, suggesting interactive effects of AGP and TSAA (DL-methionine) in the diet. KEGG function profiles calculated by PICRUST suggest that the cecal microbiome increased  and energy generation correlated with increased dietary TSAA (DL-methionine) supplementation levels during the late broiler growth period (day 42). This study increases our knowledge of microbial dynamics and functions that are relevant to host nutrition and performance that may help us tailoring alternative strategies for raising poultry birds under antibiotic-free conditions.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260596>Ablation of RhoA impairs Th17 cell differentiation and alleviates house dust mite-triggered allergic airway inflammation.</a></h1><p>Asthma is a heterogeneous chronic airway inflammation in which Th2 and Th17 cells are key players in its pathogenesis. We have reported that RhoA of Rho GTPases orchestrated  for Th2 cell differentiation and allergic airway inflammation by the use of a conditional RhoA-deficient mouse line. However, the role of RhoA in Th17 cells remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of RhoA deficiency on Th17 cells in the context of ex vivo cell culture systems and an in vivo house dust mites (HDM)-induced allergic airway inflammation. We found that RhoA deficiency inhibited Th17 differentiation and effector cytokine secretion, which was associated with the downregulations of Stat3 and Rorγt, key Th17 transcription factors. Furthermore, loss of RhoA markedly suppressed Th17 and neutrophil-involved airway inflammation induced by HDM in mice. The infiltrating inflammatory cells in the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were dramatically reduced in conditional RhoA-deficient mice. Th17 as well as Th2 effector cytokines were suppressed in the airways at both protein and mRNA levels. Interestingly, Y16, a specific RhoA inhibitor, was able to recapitulate the most phenotypes of RhoA genetic deletion in Th17 differentiation and allergic airway inflammation. Our data demonstrate that RhoA is a key regulator of Th17 cell differentiation and function. RhoA might serve as a potential novel therapeutic target for asthma and other inflammatory disorders.©2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351993>Purification and partial biochemical characterization of recombinant lactate dehydrogenase 1 (LDH-1) of the white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei.</a></h1><p>Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a key enzyme to produce energy during hypoxia by anaerobic . In the white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei, two protein subunits (LDH-1 and LDH-2) were previously identified, deduced from two different transcripts that come from the same LDH gene by processing via mutually exclusive alternative splicing. LDH-1 contains exon five and LDH-2 contains exon six and the two proteins differ only in 15 amino acid residues. Both subunits were independently cloned and overexpressed in E. coli as a fusion protein containing a chitin binding domain. Previously, recombinant LDH-2 was successfully purified and characterized, but LDH-1 was insoluble and aggregated forming inclusion bodies. We report the production of soluble LDH-1 by testing different pHs in the buffers used to lyse the bacterial cells before the purification step and the characterization of the purified protein to show that the cDNA indeed codes for a functional and active protein. The recombinant native protein is a homotetramer of approximately 140 kDa composed by 36 kDa subunits and has higher affinity for pyruvate than for lactate. LDH-1 has an optimum pH of 7. and is stable between pH 8.0 and 9.0; pH data analysis showed two pKa values of 6.1 ± 0.15 and 8.8 ± 0.15 suggesting a histidine and asparagine, respectively, involved in the active site. The enzyme optimal temperature was 44 °C and it was stable between 20 and 60 °C. LDH-1 was slightly activated by NaCl, KCl and MgCl and fully inhibited by ZnCl.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Biological changes in germinating seeds have not been investigated in poplar, a model woody plant.In this study, we exploited next-generation sequencing and metabolomics analysis and uncovered a series of significantly different genes and metabolites at various stages of seed germination and post germination. The K-means method was used to identify multiple transcription factors, including AP2/EREBP, DOF, and YABBY, involved in specific seed germination and post-germination stages. A weighted gene coexpression network analysis revealed that cell wall, amino acid metabolism, and transport-related pathways were significantly enriched during stages 3 and , with no significant enrichment observed in primary metabolic processes such as  and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. A metabolomics analysis detected significant changes in intermediate metabolites in these primary metabolic processes, while a targeted correlation network analysis identified the gene family members most relevant to these changing metabolites.Taken together, our results provide important insights into the molecular networks underlying poplar seed germination and post-germination processes. The targeted correlation network analysis approach developed in this study can be applied to search for key candidate genes in specific biochemical reactions and represents a new strategy for joint multiomics analyses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31236115>Oxygen Regulates Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Metabolic Flux.</a></h1><p>Metabolism has been shown to alter cell fate in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC). However, current understanding is almost exclusively based on work performed at 20% oxygen (air), with very few studies reporting on hPSC at physiological oxygen (%). In this study, we integrated metabolic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic data to elucidate the impact of oxygen on hPSC. Using C-glucose labeling, we show that % oxygen increased the intracellular levels of glycolytic intermediates, glycogen, and the antioxidant response in hPSC. In contrast, 20% oxygen increased metabolite flux through the TCA cycle, activity of mitochondria, and ATP production. Acetylation of H3K9 and H3K27 was elevated at % oxygen while H3K27 trimethylation was decreased, conforming to a more open chromatin structure. RNA-seq analysis of % oxygen hPSC also indicated increases in , lysine demethylases, and glucose-derived carbon metabolism, while increased methyltransferase and cell cycle activity was indicated at 20% oxygen. Our findings show that oxygen drives metabolite flux and specifies carbon fate in hPSC and, although the mechanism remains to be elucidated, oxygen was shown to alter methyltransferase and demethylase activity and the global epigenetic landscape.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399292>Huntington's Disease: Astrocytes Shift to Fatty Acid Metabolism.</a></h1><p>A recent study by Polyzos et al.

Tumor location, size, TNM stage, serum tumor markers, histopathological features, and mutations were also reviewed. Furthermore, progression-free survival (PFS) of 24 patients was analyzed.All 24 enrolled patients (20 men; 4 women; age: 62 ± 9 years) had single PSC, including 8 spindle cell carcinomas and 16 pleomorphic carcinomas. Serum levels of tumor markers were found to be abnormally increased sporadically. Six patients had central PSC, and 18 had peripheral PSC (diameter: 41 ± 16 mm). Eighteen lesions were located in the upper lobes of bilateral lungs, and 22 showed necrosis. Five cases were at TNM stage I, 12 at stage II, and 7 at stage III. The primary tumors were FDG avid in the 24 cases, with SUVmax of 17.2 ± 10.6. There were no correlations of SUVmax with tumor location, size, TNM stage, or histopathological subtypes. Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression was detected in 21 cases (positivity rate: 87.%). SUVmax of 17 lesions with PD-L1 expression degree ≥ 50% was obviously higher than that < 50% (P < 0.05). Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) gene mutation was found in six cases, and their SUVmax was significantly higher than that without KRAS mutation (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the median PFS of the 24 patients was 14 months, and 12-month and 24-month PFS rates were 55.9% and 27.8%, respectively. Only TLG-P and KRAS mutations of primary lesions were significantly associated with PFS.PSC tended to present with intense F-FDG accumulation on PET/CT, and SUVmax was useful for assessing PD-L1 and KRAS expression of PSC.

In addition, the effect of SSBE on the activities of interferon regulatory factor- (IRF5) and NF-κB p65 were further examined.Oral administration of SSBE (100 mg kg) markedly inhibited the infiltration of CD68-positive macrophages and reduced tubulointerstitial damage in kidney tissues following injury. In addition, SSBE reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokine (MIF), chemokine (MCP-1), interleukin (IL-6), IFN-γ, and TNF-α, which are involved in the infiltration and activation of macrophages. Moreover, SSBE treatment also decreased the synthesis and release of MCP-1 and MIF in tubular epithelial cells after injury. Further study revealed that SSBE downregulated the levels of IL-12 and iNOS, indicating a crucial role of SSBE on the inhibition of M1 macrophage polarization in kidney injury. In cultured macrophages, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced the polarization of macrophage towards M1 phenotype, but was inhibited by SSBE treatment. Notably, SSBE reduced the activities of interferon regulatory factor  (IRF5) and NF-κB p65 in injured kidneys and in LPS-treated macrophages, which was independent of TLR4/MyD88. As a result, SSBE reduced the expression of HIF-1α and the induction of GLUT1, and thereby inhibited anaerobic  in macrophages.SSBE exerts a marked anti-inflammatory effect and alleviates kidney injury, at least in part, by suppressing M1-macrophage polarization.Copyright © 2019.

Activating transcription factor  (ATF5) is a proposed mediator of the mammalian UPR. Herein, we hypothesized pharmacological UPR activation may protect against cardiac ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in an ATF5-dependent manner. Accordingly, in vivo administration of the UPR inducers oligomycin or doxycycline 6 h before ex vivo I/R injury (perfused heart) was cardioprotective in wild-type but not global  mice. Acute ex vivo UPR activation was not cardioprotective, and loss of ATF5 did not impact baseline I/R injury without UPR induction. In vivo UPR induction significantly upregulated many known UPR-linked genes (cardiac quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis), and RNA-Seq revealed an UPR-induced ATF5-dependent gene set, which may contribute to cardioprotection. This is the first in vivo proof of a role for ATF5 in the mammalian UPR and the first demonstration that UPR is a cardioprotective drug target.

Fluorine-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose PET/CT (F-FDGPET/CT) is the most specific radiological imaging used to assess recurrence.

Effects of PM2. and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on differentiation of T-helper 17/T-regulatory (Th17/T) cells were investigated by flow cytometry and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Mechanisms were investigated by mRNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation, bisulfite sequencing and  rates.PM2. impaired differentiation of T cells, promoted differentiation of Th17 cells, and aggravated asthma in an AhR-dependent manner. PM2. and one of its prominent PAHs, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (IP), promoted differentiation of Th17 cells by up-regulating hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression and enhancing  via AhRs. Exposure to PM2. and IP enhanced glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (Got)1 expression via AhRs and accumulation of R-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibited ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase-2 activity, resulting in hypermethylation in the forkhead box p3 locus and impaired differentiation of T cells. A Got1 inhibitor, (aminooxy)acetic acid, ameliorated asthma by shifting differentiation of Th17 cells to T cells. Similar regulatory effects of exposure to PM2. or IP on Th17/T imbalance were noted in human T cells and, in a case-control design, PAH exposure appeared to be a potential risk factor for asthma.The molecular pathways AhR-HIF-1α and AhR-Got1 mediate pulmonary responses upon exposure to PM2. through their ability to disturb the balance of Th17/T cells.Copyright © 2019.

Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis was used to analyze the correlation of PET parameters cutoff values with deep myometrial invasion (MI), lymphovascular space involvement and LNM for prognostic values in risk stratification.The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy for detection of LNM are 83.3%, 99.7%, 90.9%, 99.% and 99.2%, respectively. The MTV and TLG of primary lesion of EC in the patients with LNM are notably higher than those in patients without LNM, p<0.010. The MTV and TLG of the EC primary lesions in high-risk patients are significantly higher than those in low-risk patients (p<0.010), but the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) is not. The MTV and TLG of primary lesions were superior to SUVmax for predicting of deep MI, LNM and high-risk of EC (p<0.005).MTV and TLG of primary lesions are more valuable in predicting risk stratification of EC patients. Preoperative ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT imaging is useful in predicting the LNM of EC and may help guide pelvic lymphadenectomy to avoid unnecessary pelvic lymphadenectomy in EC patients with low-risk stratification.Copyright © 2019.

However, the fragmented nature of transcriptomic and proteomic data reduces the ability to interpret the data, notably in non-model organisms. Network-based approaches may help extracting important biological information from -omics datasets. The reproductive cycle of the freshwater crustacean Gammarus fossarum.provides an excellent case study to test the relevance of a network analysis in non-model organisms. Here, we illustrated how the use of a co-expression network analysis (based on Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis algorithm, WGCNA) allowed identifying protein modules whose expression profiles described germ cell maturation and embryonic development in the freshwater crustacean Gammarus fossarum. Proteome datasets included testes, ovaries or embryos samples at different maturation or developmental stages, respectively. We identified an embryonic module correlated with mid-developmental stages corresponding to the organogenesis and it was characterized by enrichment in proteins involved in RNA editing and splicing. An ovarian module was enriched in vitellogenin-like proteins and clottable proteins, confirming the diversity of proteins belonging to the large lipid transfer family involved in oocytes maturations in this freshwater amphipod. Moreover, our results found evidence of a fine-tuned regulation between energy production by  and actin-myosin-dependent events in G. fossarum spermatogenesis. This study illustrates the importance of applying systems biology approaches to emergent animal models to improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating important physiological events with ecological relevance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611881>The Metabolic Requirements of Th2 Cell Differentiation.</a></h1><p>Upon activation, naïve CD4 T cells differentiate into a number of specialized T helper (Th) cell subsets. Th2 cells are central players in immunity to helminths and are implicated in mediating the inflammatory pathology associated with allergies. The differentiation of Th2 cells is dependent on transcription factors such as GATA3 and STAT6, which prime Th2 cells for the secretion of interleukin- (IL-) 4, IL-, and IL-13. Several lines of work now suggest that differentiating Th2 cells in the lymph node are potent IL-4 cytokine producers, but do not become competent IL-- and IL-13-producing cells until after receiving cues from non-lymphoid tissue. It is evident that Th2 cells that enter tissues undergo considerable changes in chromatin architecture and gene expression, and that over this time, the metabolic requirements of these cells change considerably. Herein, we discuss the metabolic requirements of Th2 cells during their early and late differentiation, focusing on the impact of glucose and lipid metabolism, mTOR activation, the nuclear receptor PPAR-γ and several metabolites.Copyright © 2019 Stark, Tibbitt and Coquet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31255944>Tolerance of roots to low oxygen: 'Anoxic' cores, the phytoglobin-nitric oxide cycle, and energy or oxygen sensing.</a></h1><p>Acclimation by plants to hypoxia and anoxia is of importance in various ecological systems, and especially for roots in waterlogged soil. We present evidence for acclimation by roots via 'anoxic' cores rather than being triggered by O sensors. The evidence for 'anoxic' cores comes from radial O profiles across maize roots and associated metabolic changes such as increases in the 'anaerobic enzymes' ADH and PDC in the 'anoxic' core, and inhibition of Cl transport to the xylem. These cores are predicted to develop within 15-20 min after sudden transfer of a root to hypoxia, so that the cores are 'anoxically-shocked'. We suggest that 'anoxic' cores could emanate a signal(s), such as ACC the precursor of ethylene and/or propagation of a 'Ca wave', to other tissue zones. There, the signalling would result in acclimation of the tissues to energy crisis metabolism. An O diffusion model for tissues with an 'anoxic' core, indicates that the phytoglobin-nitric oxide (Pgb-NO) cycle would only be engaged in a thin 'shell' (annulus) of tissue surrounding the 'anoxic' core, and so would only contribute small amounts of ATP on a whole organ basis (e.g. whole roots). A key feature within this annulus of tissue, where O is likely to be limiting, is that the ratio (ATP formed) / (O consumed) is -6, both when the NAD(P)H of  is converted to NAD(P) by the Pgb-NO cycle or by the TCA cycle linked to the electron transport chain. The main function of the Pgb-NO cycle may be the modulating of NO levels and O scavenging, thus preventing oxidative damage. We speculate that an 'anoxic' core in hypoxic plant organs may have a particularly high tolerance to anoxia because cells might receive a prolonged supply of carbohydrates and/or ATP from the regions still receiving sufficient O for oxidative phosphorylation. Severely hypoxic or 'anoxic' cores are well documented, but much research on responses of roots to hypoxia is still based on bulk tissue analyses. More research is needed on the interaction between 'anoxic' cores and tissues still receiving sufficient O for oxidative phosphorylation, both during a hypoxic exposure and during subsequent anoxia of the tissue/organ as a whole.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

To understand comprehensive metabolic disturbances in this model, both cell lysates and culture supernatants were subjected to metabolomic analysis. As expected from the fact that MPP inhibits mitochondrial complex I, a metabolic shift from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to  was indicated by an increase in extracellular lactic acid and a parallel depletion of pyruvic acid. In cell lysates, the metabolic shift was supported by consistent decreases in TCA cycle intermediates. Metabolomic analysis also revealed aberrant choline metabolism.

Potential mechanisms of CI-AKI may involve diminished renal hemodynamics, inflammatory responses, and direct cytotoxicity. The hypothesis for this study is that diatrizoic acid (DA) induces direct cytotoxicity to human proximal tubule (HK-2) cells via calcium dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. HK-2 cells were exposed to 0-30 mg I/mL DA or vehicle for 2-24 h. Conversion of 3-(4,-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and trypan blue exclusion indicated a decrease in mitochondrial and cell viability within 2 and 24 h, respectively. Mitochondrial dysfunction was apparent within 8 h post exposure to 15 mg I/mL DA as shown by Seahorse XF cell mito and  Stress tests. Mitophagy was increased at 8 h by 15 mg I/mL DA as confirmed by elevated LC3BII/I expression ratio. HK-2 cells pretreated with calcium level modulators BAPTA-AM, EGTA, or 2-aminophenyl borinate abrogated DA-induced mitochondrial damage. DA increased oxidative stress biomarkers of protein carbonylation and 4-hydroxynonenol (4HNE) adduct formation. Caspase 3 and 12 activation was induced by DA compared to vehicle at 24 h. These studies indicate that clinically relevant concentrations of DA impair HK-2 cells by dysregulating calcium, inducing mitochondrial turnover and oxidative stress, and activating apoptosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31350356>Ancestral T Cells in Fish Require mTORC1-Coupled Immune Signals and Metabolic Programming for Proper Activation and Function.</a></h1><p>T cells suddenly appeared in jawed fish ∼450 million years ago. Biological studies of fish T cells may provide helpful evidence to understand evolution of adaptive immune systems. To this end, using a Nile tilapia () model, we revealed the regulatory mechanism of adaptive immunity mediated by ancestral T cells in jawed fish. Nile tilapia T cells as well as a tightly regulated mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway participate in the cellular adaptive immune response during  infection. Blockade of mTORC1 signaling by rapamycin impairs T cell activation and Ag-induced proliferation in this early vertebrate. More critically, we show that signals from mTORC1 are indispensable for primordial effector T cells to eliminate infection by promoting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, cytotoxic-related molecules, and proapoptotic genes. Mechanistically, teleost mTORC1 directs effector T cell function by coordinating multiple metabolic programs, including , glutaminolysis, and lipogenesis through activating key transcription factors c-Myc, HIF-1α, and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, and thus links immune signals to metabolic reprogramming in jawed fish. To our knowledge, these results represent the first description of the regulatory mechanism for T cell-mediated adaptive immunity in a fish species. From an evolutionary viewpoint, our study suggests that primordial T cells are armed with sophisticated regulatory strategies like those in modern T cells prior to the divergence of bony fish from the tetrapod lineage. Therefore, our findings fill in an important gap regarding evolution of the adaptive immune system.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483547>Jersey steer ruminal papillae histology and nutrigenomics with diet changes.</a></h1><p>The transition from a high forage to a high concentrate diet is an important milestone for beef cattle moving from a stocker system to the feedlot. However, little is known about how this transition affects the rumen epithelial gene expression. This study assessed the effects of the transition from a high forage to a high concentrate diet as well as the transition from a high concentrate to a high forage diet on a variety of genes as well as ruminal papillae morphology in rumen fistulated Jersey steers. Jersey steers (n = ) were fed either a high forage diet (80% forage and 20% grain) and transitioned to a high concentrate diet (20% forage and 80% grain) or a high concentrate diet (40% forage and 60% grain) and transitioned to a high forage diet (100% forage). Papillae from the rumen were collected for histology and RT-qPCR analysis. Body weight had a tendency for significant difference (p = .08). Histological analysis did not show changes in papillae length or width in steers transitioning from a high forage to a high concentrate diet or vice versa (p > .05). Genes related to cell membrane structure (CLDN1, CLDN4, DSG1), fatty acid metabolism (CPT1A, ACADSB),  (PFKL), ketogenesis (HMGCL, HMGCS2, ACAT1), lactate/pyruvate (LDHA), oxidative stress (NQO1), tissue growth (AKT3, EGFR, EREG, IGFBP5, IRS1) and the urea cycle (SLC14A1) were considered in this study. Overall, genes related to fatty acid metabolism (ACADSB) and growth and development (AKT3 and IGFBP5) had a tendency for a treatment × day on trial interaction effect. These profiles may be indicators of rumen epithelial adaptations in response to changes in diet. In conclusion, these results indicate that changes in the composition of the diet can alter the expression of genes with specific functions in rumen epithelial metabolism.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we developed a three-dimensional cell cultivation method of endometrioid cancer stem-like cells with high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity from clinical specimens. ALDH inhibition synergized with paclitaxel to block cancer proliferation. In the clinical setting, high ALDH1A1 expression was associated with poor survival. A high level of ALDH correlated with an increase of glucose uptake, activation of the glycolytic pathway, and elevation of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Blockade of GLUT1 inhibited characteristics of cancer stem cells. Similarly to ALDH inhibition, GLUT1 inhibition synergized with paclitaxel to block endometrial cancer proliferation. Our data indicated that ALDH-dependent GLUT1 activation and the resulting glycolytic activation are of clinical importance for both prognostic evaluation and therapeutic decision-making in endometrial cancer patients. In addition, the synergistic effects of taxane compounds and ALDH or GLUT1 inhibitors may serve as a new clinical treatment option for endometrial cancer.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

G6Pase and HK play an important role in insect growth by regulating the metabolism of glucose, leading to the efficient metabolism of other macromolecules. However, it is unclear whether these genes could be investigated for pest control through their actions on chitin metabolism. We studied the potential functions of G6Pase and HK genes in the regulation of chitin metabolism pathways by RNAi technology. Interference with G6Pase expression did not affect trehalose and chitin metabolism pathways in brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål). However, knockdown of the HK gene resulted in a significant decrease of expression of genes associated with the trehalose metabolic pathway but had no significant effect on trehalase activity, trehalose content, or glucogen content. Additionally, HK knockdown resulting in downregulation of the genes involved in chitin metabolism in the brown planthopper. These insects also showed wing deformities and difficulty in molting to varying degrees. We suggest that the silencing of HK expression directly inhibited the decomposition of glucose, leading to impaired chitin synthesis.© The Author(s) 2019.

Moreover, uncertainties surrounding the molecular mechanism underlying refractory AML pose a challenge when it comes to developing novel therapeutic drugs. However, accumulating evidence suggests a contribution of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling to the development of refractory AML. To assess PTEN/AKT signaling in AML, two types of AML cell lines were evaluated, namely control HL60 cells and KG1α cells, a refractory AML cell line that is resistant to idarubicin and cytarabine (AraC) treatment. Changes in the expression level of ‑ and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation‑related genes and proteins were evaluated by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses, respectively. The mitochondrial oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates were measured using an XF24 analyzer. CCK8 assay and Annexin V/PI staining were used to analyze cell viability and cellular apoptosis, respectively. The PTEN protein was found to be depleted, whereas AKT phosphorylation levels were elevated in KG1α cells compared with HL60 cells. These changes were associated with increased expression of glucose transporter 1 and hexokinase 2, and increased lactate production. AKT inhibition decreased the proliferation of KG1α cells and decreased extracellular acidification without affecting HL60 cells. Notably, AKT inhibition increased the susceptibility of KG1α cells to chemotherapy with idarubicin and AraC. Taken together, the findings of the present study indicate that activation of AKT by PTEN deficiency sustains the refractory AML status through enhancement of  and mitochondrial respiration, effects that may be rescued by inhibiting AKT activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156604>Acidogenic Potential of Oral  and Its High Fluoride Tolerance.</a></h1><p> is frequently detected in early childhood caries and white spot lesions, indicating that it is a novel caries-associated bacterium.  is known to possess a unique metabolic pathway, the "bifid shunt," which might give it cariogenic potential by increasing its acid production.

Accumulating evidence indicates that both atherosclerosis and VaD are linked to vascular inflammation. However, the role of TGRL in vascular inflammation, which increases risk for VaD, remains largely unknown and its underlying mechanisms are still unclear. We strived to determine the effects of postprandial TGRL exposure on brain microvascular endothelial cells, the potential risk factor of vascular inflammation, resulting in VaD. We showed in Aung et al., J Lipid Res., 2016 that postprandial TGRL lipolysis products (TL) activate mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increase the expression of the stress-responsive protein, activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), which injures human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) in vitro. In this study, we deployed high-throughput sequencing (HTS)-based RNA sequencing methods and mito stress and glycolytic rate assays with an Agilent Seahorse XF analyzer and profiled the differential expression of transcripts, constructed signaling pathways, and measured mitochondrial respiration, ATP production, proton leak, and  of HBMECs treated with TL. Conclusions: TL potentiate ROS by mitochondria which activate mitochondrial oxidative stress, decrease ATP production, increase mitochondrial proton leak and  rate, and mitochondria DNA damage. Additionally, CPT1A1 siRNA knockdown suppresses oxidative stress and prevents mitochondrial dysfunction and vascular inflammation in TL treated HBMECs. TL activates ATF3-MAPKinase, TNF, and NRF2 signaling pathways. Furthermore, the NRF2 signaling pathway which is upstream of the ATF3-MAPKinase signaling pathway, is also regulated by the mitochondrial oxidative stress. We are the first to report differential inflammatory characteristics of transcript variants 4 (ATF3-T4) and  (ATF3-T5) of the stress responsive gene ATF3 in HBMECs induced by postprandial TL. Specifically, our data indicates that ATF3-T4 predominantly regulates the TL-induced brain microvascular inflammation and TNF signaling. Both siRNAs of ATF3-T4 and ATF3-T5 suppress cells apoptosis and lipotoxic brain microvascular endothelial cells. These novel signaling pathways triggered by oxidative stress-responsive transcript variants, ATF3-T4 and ATF3-T5, in the brain microvascular inflammation induced by TGRL lipolysis products may contribute to pathophysiological processes of vascular dementia.Copyright © 2019.

Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion  (TLG) measured by positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan enable a precise assessment of metabolic tumor burden. However, their clinical implications in identifying patients who need more aggressive treatment in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are not fully understood.In the current prospective trial, we analyzed 101 newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC (stage III-IV) patients with measurable baseline MTV, TLG, and cfDNA quantification. The best cut-offs for cfDNA levels, MTV, and TLG to predict progression-free survival and overall survival were determined using X-tile analysis.There were significant positive correlations between cfDNA and MTV (r = 0.488, p <  0.001) and between cfDNA and TLG (r = 0.554, p <  0.001). High-cfDNA levels and high-MTV/TLG negatively correlated with overall survival (OS) (all p <  0.001). Patients with high-MTV showed similar median OS irrespective of their cfDNA levels (low-cfDNA vs. high-cfDNA=9.2 vs 6.6 months; p >  0.05). However, patients with low-MTV and low-cfDNA levels showed longer OS than those with low-MTV and high-cfDNA levels (low-cfDNA vs. high-cfDNA=49.3 vs 11. months; p <  0.001). The patient group with low-TLG also showed similar trends. The cfDNA level was an independent prognostic factor for OS by Cox-proportional hazard analysis.Although the patients with high metabolic tumor burden had a poor prognosis, regardless of the biological behavior/aggressiveness of the tumor, patients with low metabolic tumor burden and high cfDNA levels showed a poor prognosis. Taken together, this study indicates a stronger prognostic value of baseline cfDNA levels in identifying patients with advanced NSCLC and personalizing their treatment strategies for better survival.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ADCmean showed strong positive correlations with SUVmean-5hrs-F-MISO (r=0.713, p=0.021) and SUVmin-5hrs-FMISO (r=0.731, p=0.016) respectively. A moderate negative correlation (r=-0.500, p=0.049) was observed between ADCmean and MTV. At a median follow up of 44 months, the -year Kaplan-Meier estimates of loco-regional control, disease-free survival, and overall survival were 53%, 43%, and 40% respectively. Larger volume of primary tumor (GTVCT>22cc and MTV>7.9cc) and increasing hypoxia (HTV3hr-F-MSO>4.9cc) were associated with worse outcomes.Functional imaging represents an attractive and non-invasive modality to assess complex biological phenomena in solid tumors. Larger tumor volume and increasing hypoxia emerged as putative prognostic imaging biomarkers in HNSCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31218114>eIF3a mediates HIF1α-dependent glycolytic metabolism in hepatocellular carcinoma cells through translational regulation.</a></h1><p>eIF3a is the largest subunit of eIF3 complex and is a key player in translational control. Recently eIF3a is recognized as a proto-oncogene, which is overexpressed and connected to tumorigenesis of many cancers. However, the mechanistic roles of eIF3a during the tumorigenesis remain largely elusive. Here, we report that depletion of eIF3a significantly reduced HIF1α protein level and cellular  ability. Mechanistically, we found that eIF3a regulates HIF1α protein synthesis through internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-dependent translation. Importantly, through analyses of our own sample collection, we found that eIF3a is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, and a high level of eIF3a predicts poor prognosis of HCC patients. TCGA analyses further confirmed that eIF3a is coincident with an elevated activity of HIF1α pathway genes. Collectively, we identify eIF3a as a regulator for  through HIF1α IRES-dependent translational regulation, which may be a potential therapeutic target for HCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31126094>Huzhangoside A Suppresses Tumor Growth through Inhibition of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase Activity.</a></h1><p>Aerobic  is one of the important metabolic characteristics of many malignant tumors. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) plays a key role in aerobic  by phosphorylating the E1α subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Hence, PDHK has been recognized as a molecular target for cancer treatment. Here, we report that huzhangoside A (Hu.A), a triterpenoid glycoside compound isolated from several plants of the  genus, acts as a novel PDHK inhibitor. Hu.A was found to decrease the cell viability of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231, hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B, colon cancer HT-29, DLD-1, and murine lewis lung carcinoma LLC cell lines. The activity of PDHK1 was decreased by Hu.A in both in vitro assays and in vivo assays in DLD-1 cells. Hu.A significantly increased the oxygen consumption and decreased the secretory lactate levels in DLD-1 cells. In addition, Hu.A interacted with the ATP-binding pocket of PDHK1 without affecting the interaction of PDHK1 and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) subunits. Furthermore, Hu.A significantly induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential in DLD-1 cells. Consistently, when Hu.A was intraperitoneally injected into LLC allograft mice, the tumor growth was significantly decreased. In conclusion, Hu.A suppressed the growth of tumors in both in vitro and in vivo models via inhibition of PDHK activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31414206>The role of F-FDG-PET/CT in predicting the histopathological response in locally advanced cervical carcinoma treated by chemo-radiotherapy followed by radical surgery: a prospective study.</a></h1><p>This prospective study aimed to evaluate whether F-FDG-PET/CT performed before, during and after neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) could predict histopathological response in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) treated with CRT followed by radical surgery.Between October 2010 and June 2014, 88 patients with LACC were enrolled. For each patient, three F-FDG-PET/CT scans (baseline, early and final) were acquired and evaluated by qualitative and quantitative analysis. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), SUV, metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion  (TLG) were measured as absolute values and their percentage variation (delta) (early vs. baseline and final vs. baseline). The role of F-FDG-PET/CT in predicting lymph node (LN) residual disease was evaluated by qualitative analysis only. Histopathology was the reference standard.At histopathology, 40 patients had complete response (CR, pR0), 48 had partial response (PR: 21 microscopic [pR1] and 27 macroscopic [pR2]). At baseline, SUV and SUV were significantly higher in pR0 than in pR1-pR2 patients. At early evaluation, MTV and TLG were significantly higher in pR1-pR2 than in pR0 patients. At final evaluation, SUV, SUV and TLG were significantly higher in pR1-pR2 than in pR0 patients. Delta SUV parameters and delta TLG were significantly lower in PR group both during and after CRT. Delta MTV was significantly lower in patients with PR in the early phase only. In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, baseline SUV, early delta TLG, and final delta SUV better discriminated PR, providing 83.3%, 67.6% and 85% positive predictive value (PPV) and 60.3%, 90% and 70.8% negative predictive value (NPV), respectively. For LN assessment, high NPV was observed at early and final F-FDG-PET/CT (93.% and 92.3%, respectively).In LACC patients treated with CRT followed by surgery, early variations in metabolic parameters effectively discriminate histopathological PR of the primary tumor, suggesting the potential role of F-FDG-PET/CT in early personalized treatment. The high NPV of early and final PET/CT could enable "tailored surgery" by avoiding lymphadenectomy in selected patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31325096>Apatinib inhibits  by suppressing the VEGFR2/AKT1/SOX5/GLUT4 signaling pathway in ovarian cancer cells.</a></h1><p>Apatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2), and has shown encouraging therapeutic effects in various malignant tumors. As yet, however, the role of apatinib in ovarian cancer has remained unknown. Here, we sought to elucidate the role of apatinib in the in vitro and in vivo viability and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells, as well as in glucose metabolism in these cells.The effects of apatinib on ovarian cancer cell viability and proliferation were assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays, respectively. The expression of VEGFR2/AKT1/SOX5/GLUT4 pathway proteins was assessed using Western blotting, and glucose uptake and lactate production assays were used to detect  in ovarian cancer cells. SOX5 was exogenously over-expressed and silenced in ovarian cancer cells using expression vector and shRNA-based methods, respectively. RNA expression analyses were performed using RNA-seq and gene-chip-based methods. GLUT4 promoter activity was assessed using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. The expression of p-VEGFR2 (Tyr1175), p-AKT1 (Ser473), p-GSK3β (Ser9), SOX5 and GLUT4 in xenograft tissues was assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC).We found that apatinib inhibited the in vitro and in vivo viability and proliferation in Hey and OVCA433 ovarian cancer cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. We also found that apatinib effectively suppressed glucose uptake and lactate production by blocking the expression of GLUT4 in these cells. In addition, we found that SOX5 predominantly rescued the inhibitory effect of apatinib on GLUT4 expression by activating its promoter. Finally, we found that apatinib regulated the expression of SOX5 by suppressing the VEGFR2/AKT1/GSK3β signaling pathway.From our results, we conclude that apatinib suppresses the in vitro and in vivo viability and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells, as well as  by inhibiting the VEGFR2/AKT1/GSK3β/SOX5/GLUT4 signaling pathway. Apatinib may serve as a promising drug for the treatment of ovarian cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31381898>Pyruvate Kinase Regulates the Pentose-Phosphate Pathway in Response to Hypoxia in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</a></h1><p>In response to the stress of infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) reprograms its metabolism to accommodate nutrient and energetic demands in a changing environment. Pyruvate kinase (PYK) is an essential glycolytic enzyme in the phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate-oxaloacetate node that is a central switch point for carbon flux distribution. Here we show that the competitive binding of pentose monophosphate inhibitors or the activator glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) to MtbPYK tightly regulates the metabolic flux. Intriguingly, pentose monophosphates were found to share the same binding site with G6P. The determination of a crystal structure of MtbPYK with bound ribose -phosphate (R5P), combined with biochemical analyses and molecular dynamic simulations, revealed that the allosteric inhibitor pentose monophosphate increases PYK structural dynamics, weakens the structural network communication, and impairs substrate binding. G6P, on the other hand, primes and activates the tetramer by decreasing protein flexibility and strengthening allosteric coupling. Therefore, we propose that MtbPYK uses these differences in conformational dynamics to up- and down-regulate enzymic activity. Importantly, metabolome profiling in mycobacteria reveals a significant increase in the levels of pentose monophosphate during hypoxia, which provides insights into how PYK uses dynamics of the tetramer as a competitive allosteric mechanism to retard  and facilitate metabolic reprogramming toward the pentose-phosphate pathway for achieving redox balance and an anticipatory metabolic response in Mtb.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Deregulating cellular energetics is a signature hallmark of cancer, therefore modulating cancer metabolism has become an attractive anti-cancer approach in recent years. As a key enzyme in glucose metabolism, understanding the role of GSK-3β in cancer metabolic process may facilitate the development of effective therapeutic approach for HCC. In this study, we showed that inhibition of GSK-3β led to diminished viability, metastasis and tumorigenicity in HCC cells. Suppression of GSK-3β activity also reduced glucose consumption, lactate production and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in HCC cells. The decreased extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and down-regulated key enzymes on the  pathway by GSK3β inhibition demonstrated that GSK-3β was involved in  process of HCC. Mechanistically, the metabolic change and anti-cancer effect by GSK-3β inhibition was achieved mainly through activation of adenosine '-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which negatively affected  and cell proliferation. The results from primary HCC cells and from in vivo nude mice model confirmed our observations. Our study results indicated that GSK-3β may become a promising therapeutic target for HCC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Many advanced cancers are characterized by glucose dependency, leading to oxidative stress and cellular proliferation. Therefore, we sought to determine if a low glucose environment (in vitro) or a ketogenic diet (in vivo) could inhibit anaplastic thyroid cancer tumor growth when combined with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine.In vivo, nude mice were injected with the anaplastic thyroid cancer cell line 8505C (n = 6/group). Group 1 was fed a standard diet; Group 2 was fed a ketogenic diet; Group 3 was given standard diet with N-acetylcysteine (40 mM in the drinking water); and Group 4 was fed ketogenic diet with N-acetylcysteine. Tumor volumes, ketones, and glucose were measured. H&E stains and immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 and Caspase 3 were performed on the tumors. In vitro, 8505C cells were cultured in high glucose (25 mM), low glucose (3 mM), high glucose plus N-acetylcysteine (200 uM), or low glucose plus N-acetylcysteine for 96 hours. We performed CyQUANT proliferation (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), Seahorse glycolytic stress (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), and reactive oxidative stress assays.Ketogenic diet plus N-acetylcysteine decreased in vivo tumor volume compared to standard diet (22. ± 12.4 mm vs 147 ± 54.4 mm, P < .05) and standard diet plus N-acetylcysteine (P < .05). Blood ketone levels were significantly higher for the mice in the ketogenic diet group compared to standard diet (1.74 mmol/L vs 0.38 mmol/L at week , P < .001). However, blood glucose levels were not significantly different between ketogenic diet and standard diet groups. Cells cultured in low glucose plus N-acetylcysteine had significantly reduced proliferation compared to high glucose (98.1 ± .0 relative fluorescence units vs 157.8 ± 2.1 relative fluorescence units, P < .001). Addition of N-acetylcysteine to low glucose lowered  function compared to high glucose (39.0 ± 2.2 mpH/min/cell vs 89.1 ± 13.2 mpH/min/cell, P < .001) and high glucose plus N-acetylcysteine (37.4 ± 2. mpH/min/cell vs 70.3 ± 3.3 mpH/min/cell, P < .001). Low glucose plus N-acetylcysteine decreased reactive oxidative stress compared to high glucose (119 ± 34.7 relative fluorescence units vs 277 ± 16.0 relative fluorescence units, P = .014).The combination of a ketogenic diet or glucose restriction with the antioxidant- N-acetylcysteine significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo and in vitro.

We aimed to characterize the metabolic state of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after long-term exposure to tobacco smoke in smokers with preserved lung function and COPD subjects.PBMCs were isolated from healthy non-smokers (HNS), healthy smokers (HS) and COPD subjects, cultured and the mitochondrial respiration while utilizing glucose (), fatty acids (β-oxidation) or pyruvate (direct Krebs' cycle substrate) was measured using the XFp Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, IL-17, TNF-α, IL-, IL-9 and IFN-α were measured using flow cytometry. RAW264.7 cells were exposed to cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) for 1 h and its effect on cell viability, cellular metabolism and phagocytosis ability were also studied. Patient's data was analyzed using the Mann Whitney U test, whereas Student's t test was performed to analyze the in-vitro data.PBMCs from COPD subjects showed a significant decrease in extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) while utilizing glucose as compared to HNS (151.9 Vs 215%). Mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) on palmitate or pyruvate was also found to be significantly lower in COPD subjects as compared to HS and a strong positive correlation between palmitate OCR in PBMCs and FEV (r = 0.74, p < 0.05) and FVC (r = 0.79, p < 0.05) values in HS was observed. The metabolic shift towards fatty acid metabolism in healthy smokers promoted an inflammatory cytokine response with a greater increase in the levels of IL-, IL-9 and IFN-α as compared to IFN-γ, IL-17 and TNF-α. In-vitro experiments with RAW 264.7 cells showed similar metabolic alterations and a reduced ability to phagocytose Streptococcus pneumonia and Haemophilus influenza after cigarette smoke exposure in the presence of glucose or palmitate.These findings indicate a metabolic basis for the inflammatory response in COPD and could suggest a new therapeutic target for controlling the immune response and delaying the onset of disease.This observational study was retrospectively registered in the Clinical Trails Registry - India (ICMR - NIMS) on 19th January 2018 with the registration number CTRI/2018/01/011441 .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168299>Comparison of enzymatic activities and proteomic profiles of  grown on different carbon sources.</a></h1><p>The rumen microbiota is one of the most complex consortia of anaerobes, involving archaea, bacteria, protozoa, fungi and phages.

Mn causes mitochondrial toxicity; however, little is known about transcriptional responses discriminated by physiological and toxicological levels of Mn. Identification of such mechanisms could provide means to evaluate risk of Mn toxicity and also potential avenues to protect against adverse effects. To study the Mn dose-response effects on transcription, analyzed by RNA-Seq, we used human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells exposed for  h to Mn (0 to 100 μM), a time point where no immediate cell death occurred at any of the doses. Results showed widespread effects on abundance of protein-coding genes for metabolism of reactive oxygen species, energy sensing, , and protein homeostasis including the unfolded protein response and transcriptional regulation. Exposure to a concentration (10 μM Mn for  h) that did not result in cell death after 24-h increased abundance of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the protein secretion pathway that function in protein trafficking and cellular homeostasis. These include  (Golgi vesicular membrane-trafficking protein),  (ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10), and  (ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein 3). In contrast, -h exposure to 100 μM Mn, a concentration that caused cell death after 24 h, increased abundance of DEGs for components of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Integrated pathway analysis results showed that protein secretion gene set was associated with amino acid metabolites in response to 10 μM Mn, while oxidative phosphorylation gene set was associated with energy, lipid, and neurotransmitter metabolites at 100 μM Mn. These results show that differential effects of Mn occur at a concentration which does not cause subsequent cell death compared to a concentration that causes subsequent cell death. If these responses translate to effects on the secretory pathway and mitochondrial functions , differential activities of these systems could provide a sensitive basis to discriminate sub-toxic and toxic environmental and occupational Mn exposures.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31482070>Inhibition of Glyoxalase-I Leads to Reduced Proliferation, Migration and Colony Formation, and Enhanced Susceptibility to Sorafenib in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h1><p> Glyoxalase-I (Glo-I) is essential for detoxification of methylglyoxal (MGO), a byproduct of . Overexpression of Glo-I has been linked to multi-drug resistance in cancer therapy. The aim of this study was to analyze Glo-I in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the effect of the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib on Glo-I.  Expression and specific activity of Glo-I was measured in human HCC samples, HCC-cell lines (HepG2, Huh7) and a hepatocyte cell line (AML 12). Cells were either treated with Glo-I inhibitors, ethyl pyruvate (EP, 1-20 mM) and BrBzGSHCp2 (1-10 μM), or sorafenib (2.-10 μM) and protein expression (Western Blot), proliferation (WST-assay), migration (scratch assay), and colony formation (clonogenic assay) were assessed.  High expression of Glo-I was detected in human HCC tissue samples. Huh7 showed highest expression and activity of Glo-I and revealed highest proliferation compared to AML 12 and HepG2. Targeting Glo-I by EP or BrBzGSHCp led to significantly reduced proliferation (20 mM EP 24 h: 57 ± 12%), migration and colony formation. Glo-I inhibition by 20 mM EP resulted in reduced expression of PDGFR-β (18 ± 10%), VEGFR2 (46 ± 11%), VEGF (61 ± 10%), pERK/ERK (62 ± 6%), NF-κB (44 ± 12%) as well as stimulation of Nrf2 (243 ± 36%). Similar results were seen with BrBzGSHCp2. Sorafenib treatment revealed elevation of Glo-I (10 μM: 209 ± 25%) and MGO. Co-treatment of EP and sorafenib led to an additional reduction of proliferation compared to sorafenib alone.  Glo-I is positively correlated with HCC proliferation. Inhibition of Glo-I reduced proliferation, migration, and colony formation. In turn, sorafenib increases Glo-I.

However, the effects of CR in young adult mice remain largely unexplored. In addition to the fundamental, long-term changes, recent studies demonstrate that CR has a significant impact on transient, postprandial metabolic flexibility and turnover compared to control groups. The goal of this study was to identify the brain metabolic changes at a transient (2 h) and steady (6 h) postprandial state in young mice (-6 months of age) fed with CR or  (AL; free eating). Using metabolomics profiling, we show that CR mice had significantly higher levels of neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamate, N-acetylglutamate, neuronal integrity markers (e.g., NAA and NAAG), essential fatty acids (e.g., DHA and DPA), and biochemicals associated carnitine metabolism (related to reduced oxidative stress and inflammation) in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus at 2-h. These biochemicals remained at high levels at the 6-h postprandial time-point. The AL mice did not show the similar increases in essential fatty acid and carnitine metabolism until the 6-h time-point, and failed to show increases in neurotransmitters and neuronal integrity markers at any time-point. On the other hand, metabolites related to glucose utilization- and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)-were low in the CR mice throughout the 6-h period and significantly increased at the 6-h time-point in the AL mice. Our findings suggest that CR induces distinct postprandial responses in metabolites that are essential to maintain brain functions. CR mice produced higher levels of essential brain metabolites in a shorter period after a meal and sustained the levels for an extended period, while maintaining a lower level of glucose utilization. These early brain metabolism changes in the CR mice might play a critical role for neuroprotection in aging. Understanding the interplay between dietary intervention and postprandial metabolic responses from an early age may have profound implications for impeding brain aging and reducing risk for neurodegenerative disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31186744>Serum pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase as a prognostic marker for cholangiocarcinoma.</a></h1><p>Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) is a Ser/Thr kinase that inactivates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase and serves a key role in aerobic , which is a hallmark of cancer cells. The present study determined the PDK expression in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) tissues and sera to evaluate their applicability as a biomarker for CCA. Using proteomic analysis, PDK was revealed to be the most overexpressed mitochondrial protein in CCA tissues. Then, the expression of PDK isoforms in CCA tissues was examined in 15 CCA cases by immunohistochemistry. The PDK3 isoform levels in the sera were measured using a dot blot assay for 39 patients with CCA, 20 patients with benign biliary disease and 19 healthy volunteers. The results revealed a 27-fold overexpression of PDK3 in cancerous tissues when compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The immunohistochemical results demonstrated that the PDK1, 2 and 3, but not the PDK4, isoforms were overexpressed in cancerous tissues. When the PDK3 levels in the sera were examined, they were significantly higher in CCA when compared with the BBD and healthy groups. The specificity and sensitivity of PDK3 as a marker for CCA were 97. and 33.0%, respectively, and high PDK3 levels in the sera were correlated with a short survival time for CCA. In conclusion, PDK3 can be used as a diagnostic/prognostic marker for CCA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31241937>Sulforaphane Inhibits Nonmuscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Cells Proliferation through Suppression of HIF-1α-Mediated  in Hypoxia.</a></h1><p>Bladder cancer is the fourth common cancer among men and more than 70% of the bladder cancer is nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Because of its high recurrence rate, NMIBC brings to patients physical agony and high therapy costs to the patients' family and society. It is imperative to seek a natural compound to inhibit bladder cancer cell growth and prevent bladder cancer recurrence. Cell proliferation is one of the main features of solid tumor development, and the rapid tumor cell growth usually leads to hypoxia due to the low oxygen environment. In this study we found that sulforaphane, a natural chemical which was abundant in cruciferous vegetables, could suppress bladder cancer cells proliferation in hypoxia significantly stronger than in normoxia ( < 0.05): 20 μM sulforaphane inhibited bladder cancer cell proliferation by 26.1 ± 4.1% in normoxia, while it inhibited cell proliferation by 39.7 ± .2% in hypoxia in RT112 cells. Consistently, sulforaphane inhibited cell proliferation by 29.7 ± 4.6% in normoxia, while it inhibited cell proliferation by 48.3 ± .2% in hypoxia in RT4 cells. Moreover, we revealed that sulforaphane decreased glycolytic metabolism in a hypoxia microenvironment by downregulating hypoxia-induced HIF-1α and blocking HIF-1α trans-localization to the nucleus in NMIBC cell lines.

In this study, how the l-threonine production in an l-threonine producing E. coli TWF001 is controlled by the three regulators ArcA, Cra, and IclR, which control the expression of genes involved in the  and TCA cycle, has been investigated. Ten mutant strains were constructed from TWF001 by different combinations of deletion or overexpression of arcA, cra, iclR, and tdcC. l-Threonine production was increased in the mutants TWF015 (ΔarcAΔcra), TWF016 (ΔarcAPcra::Ptrc), TWF017 (ΔarcAΔiclR), TWF018 (ΔarcAΔiclRΔtdcC), and TWF019 (ΔarcAΔcraΔiclRΔtdcC). Among these mutant strains, the highest l-threonine production (26.0 g/L) was obtained in TWF018, which was a 109.7% increase compared with the control TWF001. In addition, TWF018 could consume glucose more efficiently than TWF001 and produce less acetate. The results suggest that deletion of arcA, iclR, and tdcC could efficiently increase l-threonine production in E. coli.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31321797>Proteomic Analysis Reveals Anti-Fibrotic Effects of Blue Light Photobiomodulation on Fibroblasts.</a></h1><p>This study was aimed at determining the effects of blue light photobiomodulation on primary adult mouse dermal fibroblasts (AMDFs) and the associated signaling pathways.Cultured AMDFs from adult C57BL/6 mice were irradiated by blue light from a light-emitting diode (wavelength = 463 ± 50 nm; irradiance =  mW/cm ; energy density = 4-8 J/cm ). The cells were analyzed using mass spectrometry for proteomics/phosphoproteomics, AlamarBlue assay for mitochondrial activity, time-lapse video for cell migration, quantitative polymerase chain reaction for gene expression, and immunofluorescence for protein expression.Proteomic/phosphoproteomic analysis showed inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases/mammalian target of rapamycin and casein kinase 2 pathways, cell motility-related networks, and multiple metabolic processes, including carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acid, /gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway.

We further demonstrate that enhanced  is essential for the role of miR-873 to drive HCC progression. By using immunohistochemistry analysis, we show a link between the aberrant expression of miR-873, NDFIP1, and phospho-AKT in clinical HCC samples. We also found that miR-873 was up-regulated by HIF1α, a critical -related transcription factor. However, BAY 87-2243, a HIF1α specific inhibitor, blocks miR-873 mediated tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice. Collectively, our data uncover a previously unappreciated function of miR-873 in HCC cell metabolism and tumorigenesis, suggesting that targeting miR-873/NDFIP1 axis could be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HCC patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433692>Effective glucose metabolism maintains low intracellular glucose in airway epithelial cells after exposure to hyperglycaemia.</a></h1><p>The airway epithelium maintains differential glucose concentrations between the airway surface liquid (ASL, ~0.4mM) and the blood/interstitium (-6mM) which is important for defence against infection. Glucose primarily moves from the blood to the ASL via paracellular movement, down its concentration gradient, across the tight junctions. However, there is evidence that glucose can move transcellularly across epithelial cells. Using a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) sensor for glucose, we investigated intracellular glucose concentrations in airway epithelial cells and the role of hexokinases in regulating intracellular glucose concentrations in normo- and hyperglycaemic conditions. Our findings indicated that in airway epithelial cells (H441 or primary human epithelial cells HBEC) exposed to 5mM glucose (normoglycaemia), intracellular glucose concentration is in the mM range. Inhibition of facilitative glucose transport (GLUT) with Cytochalasin B reduced intracellular glucose concentration. When cells were exposed to 15mM glucose (hyperglycaemia), intracellular glucose concentration reduced. Airway cells expressed hexokinases 1, 2 and 3. Inhibition with 3-bromopyruvate decreased hexokinase activity by ~25% and elevated intracellular glucose concentration but levels remained in the mM range. Exposure to hyperglycaemia increased , glycogen and sorbitol. Thus, glucose enters the airway cell via GLUT transporters and is then rapidly processed by hexokinase-dependent and hexokinase-independent metabolic pathways to maintain low intracellular glucose concentrations. We propose this prevents transcellular transport, aids the removal of glucose from the ASL and that the main route of entry for glucose into the ASL is via the paracellular pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428701>Compression-induced expression of  genes in CAFs correlates with EMT and angiogenesis gene expression in breast cancer.</a></h1><p>Tumor growth increases compressive stress within a tissue, which is associated with solid tumor progression. However, very little is known about how compressive stress contributes to tumor progression. Here, we show that compressive stress induces  in human breast cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) cells and thereby contributes to the expression of epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT)- and angiogenesis-related genes in breast cancer cells. Lactate production was increased in compressed CAF cells, in a manner dependent on the expression of metabolic genes , , and . Conditioned medium from compressed CAFs promoted the proliferation of breast cancer cells and the expression of EMT and/or angiogenesis-related genes. In patient tissues with high compressive stress, the expression of compression-induced metabolic genes was significantly and positively correlated with EMT and/or angiogenesis-related gene expression and metastasis size. These findings illustrate a mechanotransduction pathway involving stromal  that may be relevant also for other solid tumours.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387597>FDG-PET parameters predict for recurrence in anal cancer - results from a prospective, multicentre clinical trial.</a></h1><p>To investigate the prognostic significance of positron emission tomography (PET) parameters from F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans performed pre- and post- chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) for squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (AC).From January 2013 to January 2017, 19 patients with non-metastatic AC enrolled on a prospective trial underwent FDG-PET/CT imaging before and 12 weeks following CRT. A computer-generated volume of interest (VOI) was snapped around the primary tumour using six different standard uptake value (SUV) thresholds and the following parameters were extracted: SUV max, mean, median, standard deviation and peak as well as metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and total lesion . Exact logistic regression and ROC AUC analyses were performed for each metric at each timepoint.With a median follow up of 15.8 months, 3/19 patients had a local recurrence and /19 had any recurrence. On post-CRT PET, the median SUV within a VOI bounded by an SUV of 3 correlated with local recurrence (p < 0.01) and demonstrated excellent discrimination (ROC AUC 1.00, perfect separation was achieved at a median SUV of 3.38). The mean SUV at this threshold did not quite reach significance for prediction of local recurrence (p = 0.06) but demonstrated excellent discrimination (ROC AUC 0.91). The MTV bounded by a threshold of 41% SUVmax on the pre-CRT PET predicted for any recurrence (p = 0.03) and showed excellent discrimination (ROC AUC 0.89).FDG-PET parameters are predictive of recurrence in AC.

Candida glabrata, as a dominant strain for producing pyruvic acid, principally converts glucose to pyruvic acid through . However, this process relies excessively on high extracellular DO content. In this study, in combination with specific motif analysis of gene promoters, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) was engineered to improve the transcription level of some enzymes related to pyruvic acid synthesis under low DO level and directly led to increased pyruvic acid production and  efficiency. Moreover, the intracellular stability of HIF1 was further optimized from different aspects to maximize pyruvic acid accumulation. Finally, the pyruvic acid titer in a -L batch bioreactor with 10% DO level reached 53.1 g/L. As pyruvic acid is involved in the biosynthesis of various products, these findings suggest that HIF1-enabled regulation method has significant potential for increasing the synthesis of other chemicals in microorganisms.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

As oocytes are closely coupled to their cumulus complex, elucidating aberrations in cumulus metabolism in vitro is important to bridge the gap towards more physiological maturation conditions. The aim of this study was to analyze the equine "cumulome" in a novel combination of proteomic (nano-HPLC MS/MS) and metabolomic (UPLC-nanoESI-MS) profiling of single cumulus complexes of metaphase II oocytes matured either in vivo (n = 8) or in vitro (n = 7).A total of 1811 quantifiable proteins and 906 metabolic compounds were identified. The proteome contained 216 differentially expressed proteins (p ≤ 0.05; FC ≥ 2; 95 decreased and 121 increased in vitro), and the metabolome contained 108 metabolites with significantly different abundance (p ≤ 0.05; FC ≥ 2; 24 decreased and 84 increased in vitro). The in vitro "cumulome" was summarized in the following 10 metabolic groups (containing 78 proteins and 21 metabolites): (1) oxygen supply, (2) glucose metabolism, (3) fatty acid metabolism, (4) oxidative phosphorylation, () amino acid metabolism, (6) purine and pyrimidine metabolism, (7) steroid metabolism, (8) extracellular matrix, (9) complement cascade and (10) coagulation cascade. The KEGG pathway "complement and coagulation cascades" (ID4610; n = 21) was significantly overrepresented after in vitro maturation. The findings indicate that the in vitro condition especially affects central metabolism and extracellular matrix composition. Important candidates for the metabolic group oxygen supply were underrepresented after maturation in vitro. Additionally, a shift towards  was detected in glucose metabolism. Therefore, under in vitro conditions, cumulus cells seem to preferentially consume excess available glucose to meet their energy requirements. Proteins involved in biosynthetic processes for fatty acids, cholesterol, amino acids, and purines exhibited higher abundances after maturation in vitro.This study revealed the marked impact of maturation conditions on the "cumulome" of individual cumulus oocyte complexes. Under the studied in vitro milieu, cumulus cells seem to compensate for a lack of important substrates by shifting to aerobic . These findings will help to adapt culture media towards more physiological conditions for oocyte maturation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31274599>Lipid Emulsion Containing High Amounts of n3 Fatty Acids (Omegaven) as Opposed to n6 Fatty Acids (Intralipid) Preserves Insulin Signaling and Glucose Uptake in Perfused Rat Hearts.</a></h1><p>It is currently unknown whether acute exposure to n3 fatty acid-containing fish oil-based lipid emulsion Omegaven as opposed to the n6 fatty acid-containing soybean oil-based lipid emulsion Intralipid is more favorable in terms of insulin signaling and glucose uptake in the intact beating heart.Sprague-Dawley rat hearts were perfused in the working mode for 90 minutes in the presence of 11 mM glucose and 1.2 mM palmitate bound to albumin, the first 30 minutes without insulin followed by 60 minutes with insulin (50 mU/L). Hearts were randomly allocated to 100 µM Intralipid, 100 µM Omegaven, or no emulsion (insulin treatment alone) for 60 minutes.  and glycogen synthesis were measured with the radioactive tracer [-H]glucose, and glucose uptake was calculated. Phosphorylation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), protein kinase Akt, and phosphofructokinase (PFK)-2 was measured by immunoblotting. Glycolytic metabolites were determined by enzymatic assays. Mass spectrometry was used to establish acylcarnitine profiles. Nuclear factor κB (NFκB) nuclear translocation served as reactive oxygen species (ROS) biosensor.Insulin-mediated glucose uptake was decreased by Intralipid (4.9 ± 0.4 vs 3.7 ± 0.3 μmol/gram dry heart weight [gdw]·min; P = .047) due to both reduced  and glycogen synthesis. In contrast, Omegaven treatment did not affect insulin-mediated  or glycogen synthesis and thus preserved glucose uptake (.1 ± 0.3 vs 4.9 ± 0.4 μmol/gdw·min; P = .94). While Intralipid did not affect PP2A phosphorylation status, Omegaven resulted in significantly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibition of PP2A. This was accompanied by increased selective threonine phosphorylation of Akt and the downstream target PFK-2 at S483. PFK-1 activity was increased when compared with Intralipid as measured by the ratio of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate (Omegaven 0.60 ± 0.11 versus Intralipid 0.47 ± 0.09; P = .023), consistent with increased formation of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate by PFK2, its main allosteric activator. Omegaven lead to accumulation of acylcarnitines and fostered a prooxidant response as evidenced by NFκB nuclear translocation and activation.Omegaven as opposed to Intralipid preserves glucose uptake via the PP2A-Akt-PFK pathway in intact beating hearts. n3 fatty acids decelerate β-oxidation causing accumulation of acylcarnitine species and a prooxidant response, which likely inhibits redox-sensitive PP2A and thus preserves insulin signaling and glucose uptake.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31133865>Clinical and Molecular Spectrum of Glucose-6-Phosphate Isomerase Deficiency.

GPI deficiency, transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, is considered the second most common erythro-enzymopathy of anaerobic , after pyruvate kinase deficiency. Despite this, this defect may sometimes be misdiagnosed and only about 60 cases of GPI deficiency have been reported. GPI deficient patients are affected by chronic non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia of variable severity; in rare cases, intellectual disability or neuromuscular symptoms have also been reported. The gene locus encoding GPI is located on chromosome 19q13.1 and contains 18 exons. So far, about 40 causative mutations have been identified. We report the clinical, hematological and molecular characteristics of 12 GPI deficient cases (eight males, four females) from 11 families, with a median age at admission of 13 years (ranging from 1 to 51); eight of them were of Italian origin. Patients displayed moderate to severe anemia, that improves with aging. Splenectomy does not always result in the amelioration of anemia but may be considered in transfusion-dependent patients to reduce transfusion intervals. None of the patients described here displayed neurological impairment attributable to the enzyme defect. We identified 13 different mutations in the  gene, six of them have never been described before; the new mutations affect highly conserved residues and were not detected in 1000 Genomes and HGMD databases and were considered pathogenic by several mutation algorithms. This is the largest series of GPI deficient patients so far reported in a single study.

The set scenario of this work was to investigate the feasibilities of glucose (G) combining with sodium acetate (SA) carbon sources in enhancing biomass and lipid accumulation in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea. The results demonstrated that C. subellipsoidea subjected to the combination feeding of G (20 g/L) and SA (12 g/L) achieved the favorable biomass (.22 g/L) and lipid content (52.16%). The resulting lipid productivity (388.96 mg/L/day) was 1.33- to 7.60-fold more than those of sole G or SA as well as other combinations of G and SA. Even though the total fatty acids of C. subellipsoidea cells treated with the optimal combination of G and SA showed no noticeable increment in comparison with sole G or SA, the proportion of monounsaturated C18:1 (over 48.69%) and the content of C18:3 (< 12%) were commendable in high-quality algal biodiesel production. Further, such fascinating lipid accumulation in C. subellipsoidea cells treated with G combining with SA might be attributed to that G promoted  as well as SA activated glyoxylate shunt and TCA cycle to synergistically provide sufficient acetyl-CoA precursors for lipid accumulation. These findings hinted the potential of the combination of carbon sources in enhancing the overall lipid productivity to offset alga-based biodiesel production cost and would guide other alga strains cultivation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399405>Physiological and Transcriptional Responses of Candida parapsilosis to Exogenous Tyrosol.</a></h1><p>Tyrosol plays a key role in fungal morphogenesis and biofilm development.

To gain further insights into the physiological consequences of tyrosol treatment, we also determined genome-wide gene expression changes using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). A concentration of 15 mM tyrosol caused significant growth inhibition within 2 h of the addition of tyrosol, while the adhesion of yeast cells was not affected. Tyrosol increased the production of reactive oxygen species remarkably, as revealed by a dichlorofluorescein test, and it was associated with elevated superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase activities. The interaction between fluconazole and tyrosol was antagonistic. Tyrosol exposure resulted in 261 and 181 differentially expressed genes with at least a 1.-fold increase or decrease in expression, respectively, which were selected for further study. Genes involved in ribosome biogenesis showed downregulation, while genes related to the oxidative stress response and ethanol fermentation were upregulated. In addition, tyrosol treatment upregulated the expression of efflux pump genes, including  and , and downregulated the expression of the  and  virulence genes involved in desaturated fatty acid formation.

In this work, Tetrastigma hemsleyanum Diels et Gilg's polysaccharide (TP) can inhibit E. coli's growth in initial dosing period. Compared with the antibacterial effect of Achyranthe's polysaccharide (AP) from their metabolic profile, it's obviously that their metabolic sites for E. coli were inconsistent.

To better understand these relationships, we examined cross-sectional associations between bone turnover markers (BTMs) and metabolic traits in a population with high bone mass (HBM, BMD Z-score≥+3.2).β-C-terminal telopeptide of type-I collagen (β-CTX), procollagen type-1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and osteocalcin were assessed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. Metabolic traits, including lipids and -related metabolites, were measured using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Associations of BTMs with metabolic traits were assessed using Generalized Estimating Equation linear regression, accounting for within-family correlation, adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, height, weight, menopause, bisphosphonate and oral glucocorticoid use).198 adults with HBM had complete data, mean [SD] age 61.6 [13.7] years; 77% female. Of 23 summary metabolic traits, citrate was positively related to all BTMs: adjusted β =0.050 (95% CI 0.024,0.076),p=1.71x10 , β =6.54x10 (1.87x10 ,0.001),p=0.006 and β =2.40x10 (6.49x10 ,4.14x10 ),p=0.007 (β= increase in citrate (mmol/L) per 1μg/L BTM increase).

One of the factors that get altered in cancer microenvironment is glucose concentration. Butein, an active principle from plant, known to have anticancer effect against different types of tumor. The objective of the study is to determine the effect of butein on glucose exposed non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLCCs).The current study deals with the effect of butein (6.25-50μM) on NSCLCCs treated with different concentrations (0-40 mM) of glucose.Glucose concentration, 0 mM and 40 mM, was found to be lethal at 72 h. Viable cell numbers were statistically increased in -mM, 10-mM, and 20-mM glucose-treated cells. Butein at 12. µM inhibits ( < 0.05) glucose-induced cell proliferation. Butein inhibits glucose-induced proliferation through DNA damage and oxidative stress. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was elevated in 20-mM glucose-treated cells when compared to -mM glucose-treated cells, whereas butein treatment further increases glucose-induced mitochondrial ROS. Pharmacological inhibitor of , such as 2-deoxy glucose (2-DG), was found to inhibit ( < 0.05) glucose-induced cells proliferation. Furthermore, 2-DG and butein showed synergistic anticancer effect. Butein treatment increases p38 phosphorylation. Inhibition of p38 phosphorylation and antioxidant pretreatment partially revert the glucose-induced cell proliferation. However, inhibition of p38 phosphorylation combined with antioxidant pretreatment completely reverts the anticancer effect of butein.

We have described that obesity induced by high-fat diet (HFD) reduces infarct size in B6D2F1 mice submitted to transient coronary occlusion. In this study, we analysed the mechanism by which dietary obesity modifies the susceptibility to myocardial ischemia and the robustness of this effect. B6D2F1 (BDF), C57BL6/J (6J), C57BL6/N (6N) male mice and BDF female mice were fed with a HFD or control diet for 16 weeks. In all three strains, HFD induced obesity with hyperinsulinemia and hypercholesterolemia and without hyperglycemia, hypertension, ventricular remodelling or cardiac dysfunction. In obese mice from all three strains PDK4 was overexpressed and HSQC NMR spectroscopy showed reduced C-glutamate and increased C-lactate and C-alanine, indicating uncoupling of  from glucose oxidation. In addition, HFD induced mild respiratory uncoupling in mitochondria from BDF and 6N mice in correlation with UCP3 overexpression. In studies performed in isolated perfused hearts submitted to transient ischemia these changes were associated with reduced ATP content and myocardial PCr/ATP ratio at baseline, and delayed pHi recovery (PNMR) and attenuated hypercontracture at the onset of reperfusion. Finally, in mice subjected to 45 min of coronary occlusion and 24 h of reperfusion, HFD significantly reduced infarct size respect to their respective control diet groups in male BDF (39.4 ± 6.1% vs. 19.9 ± 3.2%, P = 0.018) and 6N mice (38.0 ± 4.1 vs. 24. ± 2.6%, P = 0.017), and in female BDF mice (35.3 ± 4.4% vs. 22.3 ± 2.%, P = 0.029), but not in male 6J mice (40.2 ± 3.4% vs. 34.1 ± 3.8%, P = 0.175). Our results indicate that the protective effect of HFD-induced obesity against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury is influenced by genetic background and appears to critically depend on inhibition of glucose oxidation and mild respiratory mitochondrial uncoupling resulting in prolongation of acidosis at the onset of reperfusion.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Starting with a fragment-based screening, a subsequent hit optimization using structure-based drug design was conducted to deliver a single-digit nanomolar lead series and to improve potency by 6 orders of magnitude. To this end, an intracellular ester cleavage mechanism of the ester prodrug was utilized to achieve intracellular enrichment of the actual carboxylic acid based drug and thus overcome high cytosolic levels of the competitive cofactors NADH/NAD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374363>Integrative omics of Lonicera japonica Thunb. Flower development unravels molecular changes regulating secondary metabolites.</a></h1><p>Lonicera japonica Thunb. is an important medicinal plant. The secondary metabolites in L. japonica are diverse and vary in levels during development, leading to the ambiguous evaluation for its medical value. In order to reveal the regulatory mechanism of secondary metabolites during the flowering stages, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses were performed. The integration analysis of omic-data illustrated that the metabolic changes over the flower developmental stages were mainly involved in sugar metabolism, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, carbon conversion, and secondary metabolism. Further proteomic analysis revealed that uniquely identified proteins were mainly involved in /phenylpropanoids and tricarboxylic acid cycle/terpenoid backbone pathways in early and late stages, respectively. Transketolase was commonly identified in the  developmental stages and 2-fold increase in gold flowering stage compared with juvenile bud stage. Simple phenylpropanoids/flavonoids and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose--phosphate were accumulated in early stages and upregulated in late stages, respectively. These results indicate that phenylpropanoids were accumulated attributing to the activated  process in the early stages, while the terpenoids biosynthetic pathways might be promoted by the transketolase-contained regulatory circuit in the late stages of L. japonica flower development.

The current study aimed to determine the optimal conditions for efficient T cell amplification by two commonly used methods involving CD3/CD28 antibody and phytohemagglutinin (PHA), respectively.Orthogonal design and CCK8 assay showed that  μg/mL CD3,  μg/mL CD28, and 100 ng/mL IL2 for the first method and 50 μg/mL PHA for the second method was optimal for T cell stimulation. Flow cytometry demonstrated that the percentage of CD8 in the stimulated groups significantly increased, while the percentage of CD4/CD8 was significantly decreased compared with the unstimulated group. The percentage of CD4 showed no significant difference among the three groups. Notably, there was no significant difference between the two stimulated groups. In addition, the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly increased in the stimulated groups compared with the unstimulated group, but showed no remarkable difference between the PHA and CD3/CD28 stimulation groups.  analysis showed that the glycolytic capacity and glycolytic reserve were both significantly increased in the PHA and CD3/CD28 groups compared with the unstimulated group, with no significant difference noted between the stimulated groups.Although both stimulation methods showed similar efficacies, we suggest the PHA method might be better considering its easy application and cost-effective nature.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31152240>Chronic AICAR treatment prevents metabolic changes in cardiomyocytes exposed to free fatty acids.</a></h1><p>The stimulation of glucose transport by metabolic stress is an important determinant of myocardial susceptibility to ischemia and reperfusion injury. Stimulation of glucose transport is markedly impaired in cardiomyocytes chronically exposed to excess free fatty acids (FFA), as occurs in vivo in type 2 diabetes. To determine whether chronic low-grade activation of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) improves substrate metabolism in cardiomyocytes exposed to FFA, isolated cultured cardiomyocytes were exposed for 7 days to FFA ± the AMPK agonist -aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR). Glucose transport and  were then measured during acute metabolic stress provoked by oligomycin. Chronic treatment with AICAR improved basal and oligomycin-stimulated glucose transport in FFA-exposed but not in control cardiomyocytes. Similarly, basal and oligomycin-stimulated  was reduced in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes but restored by chronic AICAR treatment. Conversely, fatty acid oxidation was increased in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes and reduced by chronic AICAR treatment. Chronic AICAR treatment induced in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes the biogenesis of numerous lipid droplets. Curiously, whereas acute treatment of cardiomyocytes with AICAR increased phosphorylation of the AMPKα subunit on T, a classical marker of AMPK activation, chronic AICAR treatment almost completely obliterated T phosphorylation. However, phosphorylation of the AMPK target protein raptor on S was reduced in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes but restored by AICAR treatment. In conclusion, chronic AICAR treatment induces a metabolic shift in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes, characterized by improved glucose transport and  and redirection of fatty acids towards neutral storage. Such metabolic changes in vivo could protect the hearts of patients with type 2 diabetes against ischemia-reperfusion injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145700>Two human patient mitochondrial pyruvate carrier mutations reveal distinct molecular mechanisms of dysfunction.</a></h1><p>The Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier (MPC) occupies a central metabolic node by transporting cytosolic pyruvate into the mitochondrial matrix and linking  with mitochondrial metabolism. Two reported human MPC1 mutations cause developmental abnormalities, neurological problems, metabolic deficits, and for one patient, early death. We aimed to understand biochemical mechanisms by which the human patient C289T and T236A MPC1 alleles disrupt MPC function. MPC1 C289T encodes two protein variants, a mis-spliced, truncation mutant (A58G) and a full length point mutant (R97W). MPC1 T236A encodes a full length point mutant (L79H). Using human patient fibroblasts and complementation of CRISPR-deleted, MPC1 null mouse C2C12 cells, we investigated how MPC1 mutations cause MPC deficiency. Truncated MPC1 A58G protein was intrinsically unstable and failed to form MPC complexes. The MPC1 R97W protein was less stable but when overexpressed formed complexes with MPC2 that retained pyruvate transport activity. Conversely, MPC1 L79H protein formed stable complexes with MPC2, but these complexes failed to transport pyruvate. These findings inform MPC structure-function relationships and delineate three distinct biochemical pathologies resulting from two human patient MPC1 mutations. They also illustrate an efficient gene pass-through system for mechanistically investigating human inborn errors in pyruvate metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601696>First evidence for a dose-response relationship in patients treated with Ho-radioembolization: a prospective study.</a></h1><p>Holmium-166 (Ho)-microspheres have recently been approved for clinical use for hepatic radioembolization in the EU. The aim of this study was to investigate the absorbed dose-response relationship and its association with overall survival for Ho-radioembolization in patients with liver metastases.  Patients who were treated in the HEPAR I and II studies and who underwent an FDG-PET/CT scan at baseline, a post-treatment Ho-SPECT/CT scan and another FDG-PET/CT scan at three months follow-up, were included for analysis. The post-treatment Ho-microspheres activity distributions were estimated with quantitative SPECT/CT reconstructions using a quantitative Monte Carlo-based reconstructor. Response of each individual tumor was based on the change in total lesion  (TLG) between baseline and follow-up and categorized in one of four categories, according to the PERCIST criteria, ranging from complete response to progressive disease. Patient level response was grouped according to the average change in TLG per patient. The absorbed dose-response relationship was assessed using a linear mixed-model to account for correlation of tumors within patients. Median overall survival was compared between patients with and without a metabolic liver response, using a log-rank test.  In total 36 patients with a total of 98 tumors were included. The relation between tumor absorbed dose and both tumor level and patient level response was explored. At a tumor level, a significant difference in geometric mean absorbed dose was found between response categories complete response (232 Gy (95%-confidence interval (CI) 178-303 Gy);  = 32) and stable disease (147 Gy (95% CI 113-191 Gy);  = 28),  = 0.01. and between complete response and progressive disease (117 Gy (95% CI 87-159 Gy);  = 21),  = 0.0008). This constitutes a robust absorbed dose-response relationship. At a patient level, a significant difference was found between patients with complete or partial response (210 Gy (95% CI: 161-274 Gy);  = 13) and patients with progressive disease (116 Gy (95% CI: 81-165 Gy);  = 9),  = 0.01. Patients were subsequently grouped according to their average change in TLG. Patients with objective response (complete or partial response) exhibited a significantly higher overall survival than non-responding patients (stable or progressive disease) (median 19 months versus 7. months; Log-rank;  = 0.01).  These results confirm a significant absorbed dose-response relationship in Ho-radioembolization. Treatment response is associated with a higher overall survival.Copyright © 2019 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31365859>Glutamine Synthetase Promotes Radiation Resistance via Facilitating Nucleotide Metabolism and Subsequent DNA Damage Repair.</a></h1><p>Radiation resistance is a critical problem in radiotherapy for cancer. Radiation kills tumor cells mainly through causing DNA damage. Thus, efficiency of DNA damage repair is one of the most important factors that limits radiotherapy efficacy. Glutamine physiologically functions to generate protein and nucleotides. Here, we study the impact of glutamine metabolism on cancer therapeutic responses, in particular under irradiation-induced stress. We show that radiation-resistant cells possessed low , mitochondrial respiration, and TCA cycle but high glutamine anabolism. Transcriptome analyses revealed that glutamine synthetase (GS), an enzyme catalyzing glutamate and ammonia to glutamine, was responsible for the metabolic alteration. ChIP and luciferase reporter assays revealed that GS could be transcriptionally regulated by STAT5. Knockdown of GS delayed DNA repair, weakened nucleotide metabolism, and enhanced radiosensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. Our data show that GS links glutamine metabolism to radiotherapy response through fueling nucleotide synthesis and accelerating DNA repair.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 are regulatory glycolytic enzymes, which are overexpressed in glioblastomas. Selective inhibition of these enzymes has emerged as a new approach in tumor therapy. We investigated the ratios of PFKFB3 to PFKFB4 mRNA expression in 66 astrocytic tumors of different malignancy grades. PFKFB3 mRNA levels were considerably higher than those of PFKFB4 in all analyzed tumors. IDH-wildtype glioblastomas showed lower PFKFB3 to PFKFB4 mRNA ratios (7.7:1) than IDH-mutant low-grade astrocytomas (36.:1), indicating a dependency of the ratio on malignancy grade. In IDH-wildtype glioblastomas exhibiting loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the PFKFB3 gene locus, the decrease of PFKFB3 mRNA levels was accompanied by lower PFKFB4 mRNA levels, but the PFKFB3 to PFKFB4 mRNA ratio did not differ between tumors with or without PFKFB3 LOH. IDH-wildtype primary glioblastoma patients with high PFKFB3 to PFKFB4 mRNA ratios above the average of 7.7:1 had a significantly longer overall survival time (14 months) than patients with lower ratios (9 months). Our results indicate that low PFKFB3 to PFKFB4 expression ratio is a poor prognostic factor in patients with IDH-wildtype primary glioblastoma and that PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 might represent promising targets for astrocytoma and glioblastoma treatment.© 2019 American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.

The aim of our study was to test whether these whole-body volumetric imaging parameters may predict outcome in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Sixty-five patients (45 men, 20 women; mean age ± SD, 65 ± 12 years), with histologically proven NSCLC who had undergone 18F-FDG PET/CT scan before any therapy, were included in the study. Imaging parameters including SUV, SUV, total MTV (MTV) and whole-body TLG (TLG) were determined. Univariate and multivariate analyses of clinical and imaging variables were performed using Cox proportional hazards regression. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests.A total of 298 lesions were analyzed including 65 primary tumors, 114 metastatic lymph nodes and 119 distant metastases. MTV and TLG could be determined in 276 lesions. Mean value of MTV was 81.83 ml ± 14.63 ml (SE) whereas mean value of TLG was 459.88 g ± 77.02 g (SE). Univariate analysis showed that, among the variables tested, primary tumor diameter (p = 0.0470), MTV of primary tumor (p = 0.0299), stage (p < 0.0001), treatment (p < 0.0001), MTV (p = 0.0003) and TLG (p = 0.0002) predicted progression-free survival in NSCLC patients, while age (p = 0.0550), MTV of primary tumor (p = 0.0375), stage (p < 0.0001), treatment (p < 0.0001), MTV (p = 0.0001) and TLG (p = 0.0008) predicted overall survival. At multivariate analysis age, TLG and stage were retained in the model for prediction of progression-free survival (p < 0.0001), while age, MTV and stage were retained in the model for prediction of overall survival (p < 0.0001). Survival analysis showed that patients with TLG ≤ 54.7 g had a significantly prolonged progression-free survival as compared to patients with TLG > 54.7 g (p < 0.0001). Moreover, overall survival was significantly better in patients showing a MTV ≤ 9. ml as compared to those having MTV > 9. ml (p < 0.0001). Similar results were obtained in a subgroup of 43 patients with advanced disease (stages III and IV).Whole-body PET-based volumetric imaging parameters are able to predict outcome in NSCLC patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555134>Ethanol-Induced Hepatic Insulin Resistance is Ameliorated by Methyl Ferulic Acid Through the PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway.</a></h1><p>One of the key events during the development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is that alcohol inhibits the insulin signaling pathway in liver and leads to disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism. Methyl ferulic acid (MFA) is a biologically active monomer isolated from the root of  Hasskarl. It has been reported that MFA has a hepatoprotective effect against alcohol-induced liver injury  and . However, the effect of MFA on ethanol-induced insulin resistance in ALD remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether MFA could exert protective effects against hepatic insulin resistance in ethanol-induced L-02 cells and ALD rats. ALD was induced in vivo by feeding Lieber-DeCarli diet containing % (w/v) alcohol for 16 weeks to Sprague-Dawley rats. Insulin resistance was induced  in human hepatocyte L-02 cells with 200 mM ethanol for 24 h followed by 10-7 nM insulin for 30 min. MFA exhibited the effects of inhibited insulin resistance, reduced enzymatic capacity for hepatic gluconeogenesis, and increased hepatic glycogen synthesis both  and . In addition, the results of transcriptome sequencing of liver tissues in the ethanol- and MFA-treated groups indicated that "pyruvate metabolism," "/gluconeogenesis," and "fatty acid metabolism" were significantly different between ethanol- and MFA-treated groups. Further studies suggested that MFA activated the hepatic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway  and . Taken together, these findings suggested that MFA effectively ameliorated hepatic insulin resistance in ALD at least partially by acting on the PI3K/AKT pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491402>FABP5 is correlated with poor prognosis and promotes tumour cell growth and metastasis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.</a></h1><p>To support proliferation, tumour cells often undergo a metabolic switch to aerobic , and a large amount of fatty acids (FAs) is produced to provide conditions for the formation of cell membrane structures. This phenomenon is particularly prominent in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). FAs need to be combined with fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) for transport. Fatty Acid Binding Protein  (FABP5) is an important chaperone protein of FAs that is upregulated in a variety of tumours. However, to date, the potential regulatory role and molecular mechanisms of FABP5 in the development and progression of cancers, including ccRCC, remain unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that FABP5 is upregulated in human ccRCC tissues and cell lines and is positively correlated with the progression of ccRCC. FABP5 deletion inhibits the proliferation, colony-forming ability and migration of ccRCC cells, suggesting that FABP5 may be a cancer-promoting protein in ccRCC. Mechanistically, FABP5 deletion significantly downregulated MMP9 and the transcription factor Snail1 in addition to upregulating E-cadherin and downregulating N-cadherin and Vimentin to inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the ACHN cell line. In summary, our data suggest that FABP5 may be a potential therapeutic target in ccRCC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Investigation of proteome profiles of disease specific cells facilitates our understanding of the processes and related molecular pathways, especially in disorders like BS with complex inheritance pattern and clinical heterogeneity. In the current study, we evaluated the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) proteome of 59 patients with BS (33 in active and 26 in inactive phases) and of 28 healthy controls using two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Differentially expressed protein spots with at least twofold and/or statistically significant change (p ≤ 0.05) between active BS vs inactive BS, and also active BS vs healthy controls were identified by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF). Bioinformatic analyses revealed 16 differentially expressed proteins (12 of them in active vs inactive BS comparison, whereas 11 of them for active BS vs healthy control comparison) belonging to , cytoskeleton organization, protein folding, and regulation of blood coagulation pathways. Stathmin (active BS vs inactive BS; fourfold, active BS vs healthy control; 4.7-fold) and WD repeat-containing protein-1 (active BS vs inactive BS; 2.7-fold, active BS vs healthy control; 2.7-fold), which are cytoskeleton-related proteins, were found to be lower in active patients compared to inactive patients and healthy control. Decreased levels of calreticulin (active BS vs inactive BS; 1.29-fold) and heat shock 70 kDa protein 8 (active BS vs healthy control; 1.-fold) which are involved in protein folding and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress process, were observed in patients with active phase of BS.

We have cloned and expressed PGK in Brugia malayi. The rBmPGK was found to be 415 amino acid residues long having 45 kDa subunit molecular weight. This enzyme was also identified in different life stages of bovine filarial parasite Setaria cervi. The enzyme activity was highest in microfilarial stage followed by adult female and male as also shown by real time PCR in the present study. Further using BmPGK primers the cDNA prepared from S. cervi was amplified and sequenced which showed 100% homology with Brugia malayi PGK. B. malayi and S. cervi, PGK consists of conserved calmodulin binding domain (CaMBD) having 21 amino acids. In the present study we have shown the CaMBD binds to calcium-calmodulin and regulates its activity. The binding of calmodulin (CaM) with CaMBD was confirmed using calmodulin agarose binding pull down assay, which showed that the rBmPGK binds to CaM agarose-calcium dependent manner. The effect of CaM-Caon the activity of rBmPGK was studied at different concentration of CaM (0.01-.0 μM) and calcium chloride (0.01-100 μM). The rBmPGK was activated up to 85% in the presence of CaM at 1 μM and 10 μM concentration of CaCl. Interestingly this activation was abrogated by metal chelator EDTA. Similar results were shown in case of Setaria cervi PGK. A significant increase (90 ± 10) % in ScPGK activity was observed in the presence of CaM and CaCl at 1.0 μM and 1.0 mM respectively, further increase in the conc. of CaCl, the activity of ScPGK was found to be decreased like rBmPGK. Bioinformatics studies have also confirmed the interaction between CaMBD and CaM which showed CaM interacted to Phe 206, Gln 220, Arg 223 and Asn 224 of rBmPGK CaM binding domain. On the basis of these findings, it has been suggested that the activity of filarial PGK could be regulated in cells by Ca-CaM depending upon the concentration of calcium.

Phosphofructokinase activity of TK0376 was metal-ion dependent and the highest activity (5090 μmol min mg) was found in the presence of Co followed by Mg (3280 μmol min mg) at 90°C and pH 7.. TK0376 preferred ADP as phosphoryl donor, however, it could be replaced by ATP but with a -fold lower activity. It catalyzed the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate and dephosphorylation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. In addition, it was able to phosphorylate glucose and nucleosides but with a much lower rate compared to that of fructose 6-phosphate. The apparent k and K values against fructose 6-phosphate were 4238 s and 0.74 mM, respectively. The rate of dephosphorylation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was 3-times lower at 50°C than the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate. Similarly, the rate of phosphorylation of glucose was 450-fold lower than that of fructose 6-phosphate. Phosphofructokinase activity was not allosterically regulated, but it was slightly enhanced by phosphoenol pyruvate, and inhibited by ATP and AMP in a competitive manner.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

The identification of key molecules involved in LUSC is therefore required to improve clinical diagnosis and treatment outcomes. The present study used the microarray datasets GSE31552, GSE6044 and GSE12428 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were conducted to construct the protein-protein interaction network of DEGs and hub genes module using STRING and Cytoscape. The 67 DEGs identified consisted of 42 upregulated genes and 25 downregulated genes. The pathways predicted by KEGG and GO enrichment analyses of DEGs mainly included cell cycle, cell proliferation,  or gluconeogenesis, and tetrahydrofolate metabolic process. Further analysis of the University of California Santa Cruz and ONCOMINE databases identified 17 hub genes. Overall, the present study demonstrated hub genes that were closely associated with clinical tissue samples of LUSC, and identified TYMS, CCNB2 and RFC4 as potential novel biomarkers of LUSC. The findings of the present study contribute to an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis and progression of LUSC, and assist with the identification of potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets of LUSC.Copyright: © Man et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31133647>Activation of the unfolded protein response in high glucose treated endothelial cells is mediated by methylglyoxal.</a></h1><p>Metabolic dysfunction of endothelial cells in hyperglycemia contributes to the development of vascular complications of diabetes where increased reactive glycating agent, methylglyoxal (MG), is involved. We assessed if increased MG glycation induced proteotoxic stress, identifying related metabolic drivers and protein targets. Human aortal endothelial cells (HAECs) were incubated in high glucose concentration (20 mM versus  mM control) in vitro for 3-6 days. Flux of glucose metabolism, MG formation and glycation and changes in cytosolic protein abundances, MG modification and proteotoxic responses were assessed. Similar studies were performed with human microvascular endothelial HMEC-1 cells where similar outcomes were observed. HAECs exposed to high glucose concentration showed increased cellular concentration of MG (2.27 ± 0.21 versus 1.28 ± 0.03 pmol/10 cells, P < 0.01) and formation of MG-modified proteins (24.0 ± 3.7 versus 14.1 ± 3.2 pmol/10 cells/day; P < 0.001). In proteomics analysis, high glucose concentration increased proteins of the heat shock response - indicating activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) with downstream inflammatory and pro-thrombotic responses. Proteins susceptible to MG modification were enriched in protein folding, protein synthesis, serine/threonine kinase signalling,  and gluconeogenesis. MG was increased in high glucose by increased flux of MG formation linked to increased glucose metabolism mediated by proteolytic stabilisation and increase of hexokinase-2 (HK-2); later potentiated by proteolytic down regulation of glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) - the major enzyme of MG metabolism. Silencing of Glo1, selectively increasing MG, activated the UPR similarly. Silencing of HK-2 prevented increased glucose metabolism and MG formation. trans-Resveratrol and hesperetin combination (tRES-HESP) corrected increased MG and glucose metabolism by increasing expression of Glo1 and decreasing expression of HK-2. Increased MG glycation activates the UPR in endothelial cells and thereby may contribute to endothelial cell dysfunction in diabetic vascular disease where tRES-HESP may provide effective therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571126>RNase G controls tpiA mRNA abundance in response to oxygen availability in Escherichia coli.</a></h1><p>Studies have shown that many enzymes involved in  are upregulated in Escherichia coli endoribonuclease G (rng) null mutants.

While recent advancements in research have shown the MSCs have immunomodulatory functions which are altered in response to host inflammatory molecules, how these stimuli produce different functional outcomes is not understood. Here, we evaluate research examining how the proinflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) affects the immunomodulatory functions of MSCs by altering their metabolism. This study indicates that IFN-γ causes an increase in glycolytic activity and uncoupling of  to tricarboxylic acid cycle and hence, the glycolytic metabolites and intermediates can be funneled toward the production of anti-inflammatory modulators indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase and PGE2. A complete understanding of how MSCs' cellular metabolism affects their function is necessary for their employment in cellular therapy, as MSCs have been demonstrated to have pro- and anti-inflammatory functions.

The levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the high dosage EE-treated group were significantly reduced, while activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were obviously increased. The islet area and the number of insulin-positive beta cells increased significantly in the high dose group. Furthermore, expression levels of insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate (IRS), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p-Akt and phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK3β) involved in insulin signalling were increased. Adenosine '-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) also were activated to regulate glucose metabolism in EE-treated groups. The levels of glucose 6-phosphatase (G6pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) decreased, while the glucokinase (GK) level increased to promote . The results clearly indicated that oral EE, especially at a high dose, could improve the glucose metabolism of T2DM by reducing inflammatory reactions, enhancing the antioxidant capacity and insulin sensitivity, and regulating the balance between  and gluconeogenesis, which means that EE has potential ameliorative effects on T2DM mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31382948>Metabolic flux analysis for metabolome data validation of naturally xylose-fermenting yeasts.</a></h1><p>Efficient xylose fermentation still demands knowledge regarding xylose catabolism. In this study, metabolic flux analysis (MFA) and metabolomics were used to improve our understanding of xylose metabolism. Thus, a stoichiometric model was constructed to simulate the intracellular carbon flux and used to validate the metabolome data collected within xylose catabolic pathways of non-Saccharomyces xylose utilizing yeasts.A metabolic flux model was constructed using xylose fermentation data from yeasts Scheffersomyces stipitis, Spathaspora arborariae, and Spathaspora passalidarum. In total, 39 intracellular metabolic reactions rates were utilized validating the measurements of 11 intracellular metabolites, acquired by mass spectrometry. Among them, 80% of total metabolites were confirmed with a correlation above 90% when compared to the stoichiometric model. Among the intracellular metabolites, fructose-6-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, ribulose--phosphate, and malate are validated in the three studied yeasts. However, the metabolites phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate could not be confirmed in any yeast. Finally, the three yeasts had the metabolic fluxes from xylose to ethanol compared. Xylose catabolism occurs at twice-higher flux rates in S. stipitis than S. passalidarum and S. arborariae. Besides, S. passalidarum present 1. times high flux rate in the xylose reductase reaction NADH-dependent than other two yeasts.This study demonstrated a novel strategy for metabolome data validation and brought insights about naturally xylose-fermenting yeasts. S. stipitis and S. passalidarum showed respectively three and twice higher flux rates of XR with NADH cofactor, reducing the xylitol production when compared to S. arborariae. Besides then, the higher flux rates directed to pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and  pathways resulted in better ethanol production in S. stipitis and S. passalidarum when compared to S. arborariae.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31120438>Platelet bioenergetics correlate with muscle energetics and are altered in older adults.</a></h1><p>Physical function decreases with age, and though bioenergetic alterations contribute to this decline, the mechanisms by which mitochondrial function changes with age remains unclear. This is partially because human mitochondrial studies require highly invasive procedures, such as muscle biopsies, to obtain live tissue with functional mitochondria. However, recent studies demonstrate that circulating blood cells are potentially informative in identifying systemic bioenergetic changes. Here, we hypothesize that human platelet bioenergetics reflect bioenergetics measured in muscle biopsies.We demonstrate that maximal and ATP-linked respiratory rate measured in isolated platelets from older adults (86-93 years) correlates significantly with maximal respiration (r = 0.595; P = 0.003) measured by muscle biopsy respirometry and maximal ATP production (r = 0.643; P = 0.004) measured by 31P-MRS respectively, in the same individuals. Comparison of platelet bioenergetics in this aged cohort to platelets from younger adults (18-35 years) shows aged adults demonstrate lower basal and ATP-linked respiration. Platelets from older adults also show enhanced proton leak, which is likely due to increased protein levels of uncoupling protein 2, and correlates with increased gate speed in this cohort (r = 0.58; P = 0.0019). While no significant difference in  was observed in older adults compared to younger adults, platelet glycolytic rate correlated with fatigability (r = 0.44; P = 0.016).These data advance the mechanistic understanding of age-related changes in mitochondrial function. Further, they suggest that measuring platelet bioenergetics provides a potential supplement or surrogate for muscle biopsy measurement and may be a valuable tool to study mitochondrial involvement in age-related decline of physical function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31347792>Metabolomics-based pathway changes in testis fragments treated with ethinylestradiol in vitro.</a></h1><p>There is a need to develop in vitro models to test drugs and chemicals that induce toxicity in the male reproductive system. We have evaluated an in vitro mouse testis organ culture model capable of producing viable, fertilization-proven sperm as a possible toxicity test model. Although this in vitro model was limited to round spermatid differentiation, histopathology observations could still be performed. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis (LC/MS)-based metabolomics was used to measure metabolome changes of chemically treated in vitro testis fragments.On Postnatal Day , C57BL/6J mouse testes were divided into four fragments, which were placed onto a 1.% agarose gel cube and cultured in α-MEM including 0.4% AlbuMAX I (Day 0). On Day 1 of culture, testis fragments were treated with 0 (control), 0.01, or 1 nM ethinylestradiol (EE). On Day 20 of culture, the testis fragments were collected for LC/MS and histology analysis.Several metabolites involved in glycogen metabolism and  pathways (uridine diphosphate-glucose, glucose phosphate, and pyruvate), in the tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway (oxaloacetate and aspartate), and in the arginine and proline metabolism (arginine and spermine) were significantly altered in the 1 nM EE treated group compared to the control group. The metabolite changes were associated with an increase in percentage of seminiferous tubules with round spermatids as well as dose-dependent dead cells.These findings suggest that EE treatment may cause testicular toxicity by affecting glycogen metabolism and energy pathways. To confirm these findings, further experiments will be necessary using other testicular toxicants.Published 2019.

Our analysis revealed that: 1) LPC induces upregulation of three TIPs including  enzymes (GE), mevalonate enzymes (ME), and acetyl-CoA generating enzymes (ACE); 2) LPC induces upregulation of 29% of 31 histone acetyltransferases, three of which acetylate H3K14; 3) LPC induces H3K14 acetylation (H3K14ac) in the genomic DNA that encodes LPC-induced TIP genes (79%) in comparison to that of in LPC-induced effector genes (43%) including ICAM-1; 4) TIP pathways are significantly different from that of EC activation effectors including adhesion molecule ICAM-1; ) reactive oxygen species generating enzyme NOX2 deficiency decreases, but antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2 deficiency increases, the expressions of a few TIP genes and EC activation effector genes; and 6) LPC induced TIP genes(81%) favor inter-chromosomal long-range interactions (CLRI, trans-chromatin interaction) while LPC induced effector genes (65%) favor intra-chromosomal CLRIs (cis-chromatin interaction). Our findings demonstrated that proatherogenic lipids upregulate TIPs in HAECs, which are a new category of qualification markers for chronic disease risk factors and conditional DAMPs and potential mechanisms for acute inflammation transition to chronic ones. These novel insights may lead to identifications of new cardiovascular risk factors in upregulating TIPs in cardiovascular cells and novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of metabolic cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, and cancers.

In pre-treatment F18 [FDG] PET-computed tomography for primary tumour area maximum standard uptake value, metabolic tumour volume, tumour lesion , tumour diameter and for axillary lymph nodes maximum standard uptake value-LN were recorded. Also if distant metastatic sites were observed they were verified.The median follow-up period was 43.8 months. Five-year overall survival was 98% vs. 56% in patients with tumour diameter < vs. ≥22 mm, 93% vs. 50% in patients with maximum standard uptake value-T < vs. ≥6.7, 71% vs. 70% in patients with metabolic tumour volume < vs. ≥8.31cm, 94% vs. 49% in patients with maximum standard uptake value-LN < vs. ≥1.6, 98% vs. 48% in patients with tumour lesion  < vs. ≥19 084 g/ml × cm, 90% vs. 30% in patients with negative or positive distant metastases in initial PET/computed tomography, respectively. Maximum standard uptake value-LN with a cut-off level of <1.6 and <.7 had high sensitivity and specificity for predicting axillary lymph node and systemic metastasis, respectively. Additionally, tumour lesion  was the strongest independent prognostic factor for overall survival.Our data shows that the combination of pre-treatment tumour lesion  and maximum standard uptake value-LN could improve risk stratification among breast cancer patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31267132>Adipose tissue proteomic analysis in ketotic or healthy Holstein cows in early lactation1.</a></h1><p>Ketosis is a major metabolic disorder of high-yielding dairy cows during the transition period. Although metabolic adaptations of the adipose tissue are critical for a successful transition, beyond lipolysis, alterations within adipose tissue during ketosis are not well known. The objective of this study was to investigate the adipose tissue proteome of healthy or ketotic postpartum cows to gain insights into biological adaptations that may contribute to disease outcomes. Adipose tissue biopsy was collected on  healthy and  ketotic cows at 17 (±4) d postpartum and ketosis was defined according to the clinical symptoms and serum β-hydroxybutyrate concentration. Morphology micrographs stained by hematoxylin-eosin showed that adipocytes were smaller in ketotic cows than in healthy cows. The isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification was applied to quantitatively identify differentially expressed proteins (DEP) in the adipose tissue. We identified a total of 924 proteins, 81 of which were differentially expressed between ketotic and healthy cows (P < 0.05 and fold changes >1. or <0.67). These DEP included enzymes and proteins associated with various carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism processes. The top pathways differing between ketosis and control cows were /gluconeogenesis, glucagon signaling pathway, cysteine and methionine metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, and the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. The identified DEP were further validated by western blot and co-immunoprecipitation assay. Key enzymes associated with carbohydrate metabolism such as pyruvate kinase 2, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit α), lactate dehydrogenase A , phosphoglucomutase 1, and 6-phosphofructokinase 1 were upregulated in ketotic cows. The expression and phosphorylation state of critical regulators of lipolysis such as perilipin-1 and hormone-sensitive lipase were also upregulated in ketotic cows. Furthermore, key proteins involved in maintaining innate immune response such as lipopolysaccharide binding protein and regakine-1 were downregulated in ketotic cows. Overall, data indicate that ketotic cows during the transition period have altered carbohydrate, lipid metabolism, and impaired immune function in the adipose tissue. This proteomics analysis in adipose tissue of ketotic cows identified several pathways and proteins that are components of the adaptation to ketosis.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here we show that instantaneous physical stress in a homogeneous environment (without concentration gradient) induces fast adaptation of Escherichia coli. We exposed E. coli to a large number of collisions of around 10 per bacterium per second with sharp ZnO nanorods. The pressure exerted on the bacterial cell wall was up to 10 GPa and induced phenotype changes. The bacteria's shape became more spherical, the density of their periplasm increased by around 15% and the average thickness of the cell wall by 30%. Such E. coli cells appeared almost as Gram-positive bacteria in the standard Gram staining. Additionally, we observed a combination of changes occurring at the genomic level (mutations identified in form of single nucleotide polymorphisms) and down-regulation of expression of 61 genes encoding proteins involved in β-oxidation of fatty acids, , the citric acid cycle, as well as uptake of amino acids and enzyme cofactors. Thus, we show that bacteria undergo phenotypic changes upon instantaneous, acute physical stress without any obviously available time for gradual adaptation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145358>Which of the fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computerized tomography parameters are better associated with prognostic factors in breast cancer?</a></h1><p>The aim of the present study is to evaluate the relationship between the immunohistochemical and histopathological prognostic factors and the metabolic fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (PET/CT) parameters in breast cancer.A total of 94 female patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer (median age: 54. years, 94 lesions with size >15 mm) who underwent PET/CT imaging before any treatment were enrolled to this retrospective study. Maximum and average standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVavg), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion  (TLG), and tumor/liver uptake ratio (TLR) of the primary tumors were calculated and compared between various histopathological and immunohistochemical prognostic factor groups.All metabolic parameters were associated with clinical T stage, metabolic M stage, and nuclear grade. The MTV, TLG, and TLR were significantly higher in patients with suspected lymph node metastasis. There were significant differences according to estrogen receptor and human epidermal growth factor-2 status in the metabolic values other than MTV. In case of progesterone receptor, there were significant differences in the metabolic characteristics except for the MTV and TLG values. The Ki-67 labeling index was moderately correlated with SUVmax, SUVavg, and TLR. All metabolic characteristics except MTV were significantly higher in triple negative breast cancer compared with the other molecular subtypes.The results of the present study suggest that the TLG and TLR values have stronger associations with several prognostic factors in breast cancer (BC) compared with other metabolic parameters.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31233276>Glutaminase 1 Inhibition Reduces  and Ameliorates Lupus-like Disease in MRL/lpr Mice and Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis.</a></h1><p>Glutaminase 1 (Gls1) is the first enzyme in glutaminolysis.

However, only a minor fraction of sRNAs is well characterized with respect to the spectra of their targets, conditional expression profiles and actual mechanisms they use to regulate gene expression to control particular biological pathways. To learn more about the specific contribution of sRNAs to the global regulatory network controlling the Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism (CCM), we employed microarray analysis and compared transcriptome profiles of E. coli cells grown on two alternative minimal media supplemented with either pyruvate or glucose, respectively. Microarray analysis revealed that utilization of these alternative carbon sources led to profound differences in gene expression affecting all major gene clusters associated with CCM as well as expression of several known (CyaR, RyhB, GcvB and RyeA) and putative (C0652) sRNAs. To assess the impact of transcriptional reprogramming of gene expression on E. coli protein abundance, we also employed two-dimensional protein gel electrophoresis. Our experimental data made it possible to determine the major pathways for pyruvate assimilation when it is used as a sole carbon source and reveal the impact of other key processes (i.e., energy production, molecular transport and cell resistance to stress) associated with the CCM in E. coli. Moreover, some of these processes were apparently controlled by GcvB, RyhB and CyaR at the post-transcriptional level, thus indicating the complexity and interconnection of the regulatory networks that control CCM in bacteria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534187>ITGB4-mediated metabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts.</a></h1><p>Integrin beta 4 (ITGB4) overexpression in cancer cells contributes to cancer progression. However, the role of stromal ITGB4 expression in cancer progression remains poorly understood, despite stromal ITGB4 overexpression in malignant cancers. In our study, ITGB4-overexpressing triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells provided cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) with ITGB4 proteins via exosomes, which induced BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and lactate production in CAFs. In coculture assays, the ITGB4-induced mitophagy and  were suppressed in CAFs by knocking down ITGB4 or inhibiting exosome generation in MDA-MB-231, or blocking c-Jun or AMPK phosphorylation in CAFs. ITGB4-overexpressing CAF-conditioned medium promoted the proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and invasion of breast cancer cells. In a co-transplant mouse model, MDA-MB-231 made a bigger tumor mass with CAFs than ITGB4 knockdown MDA-MB-231.

While the expansion of subcutaneous adipose tissues (SAT) is protective in obesity, that of visceral adipose tissues (VAT) correlates with the emergence of metabolic diseases. Maintained in fat pads throughout life, adipose stem cells (ASC) are mesenchymal-like stem cells with adipogenesis and multipotent differentiation potential. ASC from distinct fat pads have long been reported to present distinct proliferation and differentiation potentials that are maintained in culture, yet the origins of these intrinsic differences are still unknown. Metabolism is central to stem cell fate decision in line with environmental changes. In this study, we performed high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomic analyses of ASC culture supernatants in order to characterize their metabolic phenotype in culture. We identified and quantified 29 ASC exometabolites and evaluated their consumption or secretion over 72 h of cell culture. Both ASC used  and mitochondrial metabolism, as evidenced by the high secretions of lactate and citrate, respectively, but V-ASC mostly used . By varying the composition of the cell culture medium, we showed that glutaminolysis, rather than , supported the secretion of pyruvate, alanine, and citrate, evidencing a peculiar metabolism in ASC cells. The comparison of the two types of ASC in glutamine-free culture conditions also revealed the role of glutaminolysis in the limitation of pyruvate routing towards the lactate synthesis, in S-ASC but not in V-ASC. Altogether, our results suggest a difference between depots in the capacity of ASC mitochondria to assimilate pyruvate, with probable consequences on their differentiation potential in pathways requiring an increased mitochondrial activity. These results highlight a pivotal role of metabolic mechanisms in the discrimination between ASC and provide new perspectives in the understanding of their functional differences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31388998>Prognostic utility of pre-transplantation [ F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who underwent rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, carboplatin salvage chemotherapy.</a></h1><p>We analysed the outcomes of 62 patients with refractory/relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (rrDLBCL) who had pre-transplantation fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) after R-DHAC (rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, carboplatin) salvage chemotherapy, and were evaluated using Deauville criteria and total lesion  (TLG).

The notothenioid group is metabolically specialized to low-temperature environments and may be vulnerable to the climatic changes imposed on the Antarctic continent. However, gradual temperature changes potentially allow an opportunity for plasticity adjustments. The present study evaluated the effect of gradual increase of temperature on the enzymatic and nonenzymatic parameters of energy metabolism in renal, branchial, hepatic, and encephalic tissue of Notothenia rossii subjected to a gradual temperature change of 0. °C/day until reaching 2 °C, 4 °C, 6 °C, and 8 °C. Under the effect of an acclimation rate of 0. °C/day, the gill tissue showed increased phosphofructokinase (PFK) enzyme activity. In the kidney, there was increased activity of the malate dehydrogenase (MDH), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PDH), and glycogen phosphorylase (GP) enzymes. There was an increase in lactate concentration in the liver and an increase in GP enzyme activity in the brain.

Reports of significant mood stabilisation or remission of symptoms over a period were substantially higher for a ketogenic diet than for other diets (93/165, 56.4%, 95% CI 48.4-64.1) v. 14/94, 14.9%, 95% CI 8.4-23.7), odds ratio 7.4, 95% CI 3.8-14.1, P < 0.0001), many with detailed reports of the improvements experienced and several lasting for extended periods (months to years).

Early mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are linked to impaired glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle. In this study, we investigated the effects of BPA on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity. L6 myotubes were treated with BPA (1 nM-10 nM) during the last 24 h of differentiation. Following exposure to 10 nM of BPA, resting and maximal oxygen consumption rates were decreased, whereas mitochondrial proton leak was increased. Overall metabolic activity, measured by redox ability, was decreased in L6 myotubes exposed to 10 nM of BPA. At this concentration, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was increased, which corresponded to an increased phosphorylation of the insulin signaling protein Akt, and increased  measured by extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Acute BPA exposure did not alter levels of oxidative stress markers in muscle cells, but significantly increased mitochondrial proton leak, which is known to be involved in decreased ROS production. The effects of BPA on glucose uptake, but not mitochondrial function, were reversed by the use of an estrogen receptor antagonist. These results suggest that acute exposure of L6 myotubes at only high concentrations of BPA alters glucose metabolism, which is likely a compensatory response to reduced mitochondrial energy production capacity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Variation in bull fertility has been demonstrated even among those animals exhibiting normal sperm numbers, motility, and morphology. Despite advances in research, molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the causes of low fertility in some bulls have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the metabolic profile of bull spermatozoa using non-targeted metabolomics. Statistical analysis and bioinformatic tools were employed to evaluate the metabolic profiles high and low fertility groups. Metabolic pathways associated with the sperm metabolome were also reported.A total of 22 distinct metabolites were detected in spermatozoa from bulls with high fertility (HF) or low fertility (LF) phenotype. The major metabolite classes of bovine sperm were organic acids/derivatives and fatty acids/conjugates. We demonstrated that the abundance ratios of five sperm metabolites were statistically different between HF and LF groups including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), carbamate, benzoic acid, lactic acid, and palmitic acid. Metabolites with different abundances in HF and LF bulls had also VIP scores of greater than 1. and AUC- ROC curves of more than 80%. In addition, four metabolic pathways associated with differential metabolites namely alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, β-alanine metabolism,  or gluconeogenesis, and pyruvate metabolism were also explored.This is the first study aimed at ascertaining the metabolome of spermatozoa from bulls with different fertility phenotype using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We identified five metabolites in the two groups of sires and such molecules can be used, in the future, as key indicators of bull fertility.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670970>Side Chain Optimization Remarkably Enhances the In Vivo Stability of 18F-Labeled Glutamine for Tumor Imaging.</a></h1><p>Similar to , glutaminolysis acts as a vital energy source in tumor cells, providing building blocks for the metabolic needs of tumor cells. To capture glutaminolysis in tumors, 18F-(2S,4R)4-Fluoroglutamine ([18F]FGln) and 18F-fluoroboronoglutamine ([18F]FBQ) have been successfully developed for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, but these two molecules are lack of stability, resulting in undesired yet significant bone uptake. In this study, we found that [18F]FBQ-C2 is a stable Gln PET tracer by adding two more methylene groups to the side chain of [18F]FBQ. [18F]FBQ-C2 was synthesized with a good radiochemical yield (RCY) of 35% and over 98% radiochemical purity. [18F]FBQ-C2 showed extreme stability in vitro, and no defluorination was observed after 2 hours in phosphate buffered saline at 37 °C. The competitive inhibition assay results indicated that [18F]FBQ-C2 enters cells via system ASC and N, similar to natural glutamine, and can be transported by tumor-overexpressed ASCT2. PET imaging and biodistribution results indicated that [18F]FBQ-C2 is stable in vivo with low bone uptake (0.81±0.20%ID/g) and can be cleared rapidly from most tissues. Dynamic scan and pharmacokinetic studies using BGC823-xenograft-bearing mice revealed that [18F]FBQ-C2 accumulates specifically in tumors, with a longer half-life (101.18±6.50 min) in tumor tissues than in other tissues (52.70±12.44 min in muscle). Biodistribution exhibits a high tumor-to-normal tissue ratio (4.8±1.7 for muscle, 2.±1.0 for the stomach, 2.2±0.9 for the liver and 17.8±8.4 for the brain). In conclusion, [18F]FBQ-C2 can be used to perform high-contrast Gln imaging of tumors and can serve as a PET tracer for clinical research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271899>Hypoxia-induced RelA/p65 derepresses SLC16A3 (MCT4) by downregulating ZBTB7A.</a></h1><p>Overexpressed Solute Carrier Family 16 Member 3 (SLC16A3, also called MCT4) plays a critical role in hypoxic cancer cell growth and proliferation, by expelling -derived lactate across the plasma membrane. However, how SLC16A3 expression is regulated, under hypoxic conditions, is poorly understood. FBI-1, encoded by ZBTB7A, is a proto-oncoprotein. Interestingly, under hypoxic conditions, expression of SLC16A3, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), increased gradually, while FBI-1 expression decreased, suggesting a negative correlation between SLC16A3/HIF-1 and FBI-1 expression. Consequently, we hypothesized that FBI-1 might regulate SLC16A3 and/or HIF-1 expression. Transient transfection and transcription assays of SLC16A3 promoter reporter fusion constructs, oligonucleotide-pulldowns, and ChIP assays, showed that HIF-1α activates SLC16A3 by binding to a hypoxia-response element (HRE), while ectopic FBI-1 potently repressed SLC16A3, by binding to both FBI-1-response elements (FREs) and HREs, during hypoxia. Further evidence for this model was downregulation of ZBTB7A, correlated with SLC16A3 upregulation, in hypoxic colon cancer cells. We also investigated how FBI-1 expression is downregulated during hypoxia. The '-upstream regulatory region of ZBTB7A contains two NF-κB-binding sites and two HREs. Interestingly, hypoxia activated NF-κB (RelA/p65) and also increased its nuclear translocation. NF-κB repressed ZBTB7A by binding NF-κB-binding elements, and downregulated the repressor FBI-1, thereby increasing SLC16A3 transcription. While transcriptional repression of SLC16A3 by FBI-1 inhibited lactate efflux, repression of ZBTB7A and activation of lactate efflux by NF-κB, increased colon cancer cell growth and proliferation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The results revealed that glucose was a preferable precursor for DNJ synthesis, and its carbon skeleton underwent a C2-N-C6 cyclization reaction during synthesis. The biosynthetic pathway was related to the  pathway, and started from fructose-6-phosphate, and involved amination, dephosphorylation, oxidation, cyclization, dehydration, and reduction reaction steps, yielding DNJ. Then, based on clarified biosynthetic pathway information, precursors, analogs, and metabolism inhibitors were used as novel regulators to enhance the production of DNJ. The results demonstrated that the titer of DNJ could reach 296.56 mg/L, which was 3.3-fold higher than that of a control group (90 mg/L) when sodium citrate (0 h,  g/L), sorbose (0 h, 1 g/L), iodoacetic acid (20 h, 50 mg/L), and glucose (26 h, 7 g/L) were added during the fermentation process. This study provides a new understanding of the biosynthetic pathway of DNJ, and also provides an efficient strategy to regulate the production of DNJ based on this biosynthetic pathway, which is a new perspective for the regulation of other secondary metabolites.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287882>Fatty acids modulate the expression of pyruvate kinase and arachidonate-lipoxygenase through PPARγ/CYP2C45 pathway: a link to goose fatty liver.</a></h1><p>Cytochrome P-450 2C45 (CYP2C45) is the most highly expressed cytochrome P-450 isoform in chicken liver, and may play an important role in avian liver biology. However, information regarding the function of CYP2C45 in fatty liver is generally limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CYP2C45 during the development of goose fatty liver. Our result indicated that the transcription of CYP2C45, together with PK and ALOX5, was increased in goose liver upon overfeeding for 19 D (P < 0.05). In goose primary hepatocytes, CYP2C45 RNA expression was also upgraded by the treatment with various chemicals like insulin, the fatty acids, and PPAR agonists (P < 0.05). We also found that both CYP2C45 overexpression and troglitazone treatment could increase the expression of pyruvate kinase (PK) and arachidonate -lipoxygenase (ALOX5), and furthermore, showed that the up-regulation of PK and ALOX5 induced by troglitazone could be suppressed by small interfering RNAs targeting CYP2C45 (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that fatty acids treatment and the overfeeding can induce the up-regulation of CYP2C45 expression possibly via PPARγ and that the induction of PK and ALOX5 in goose fatty liver is at least partially attributed to fatty acid-induced expression of CYP2C45. Thus, our data provides an insight into the mechanism by which  and arachidonic acid metabolism are modulated in goose fatty liver.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450417>Sensitive quantitative analysis of phosphorylated primary metabolites using selective metal oxide enrichment and GC- and IC- MS/MS.</a></h1><p>In this study, we present a novel selective cleanup/enrichment method based on metal oxide solid phase extraction combined with quantitative gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and ion exchange chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the analysis of phosphorylated metabolites in yeast cell extracts relevant to biotechnological processes. Following screening of several commercially available metal oxide-based enrichment materials, all steps of the enrichment process (loading, washing and elution) were optimized for both the selective enrichment of 12 phosphorylated compounds from the  and pentose phosphate pathways, and the simultaneous removal of highly abundant matrix components such as organic acids and sugars. The full analytical workflow was then validated to meet the demands of accurate quantification of phosphorylated metabolites in yeast (Pichia pastoris) cell extracts using the best performing material and cleanup/enrichment method combined with quantification strategies based on internal standardization with isotopically labeled internal standards and external calibration. A good recovery (>70%) for  of the 12 targeted phosphorylated compounds with RSDs of less than 6.0% was obtained while many sugars, organic acids and amino acids were removed (>99% of glucose, and >95% of aspartate, succinate, glutamate, alanine, glycine, serine, threonine, proline, and valine). The use of isotopically labeled internal standards added to the samples prior to SPE, enables accurate quantification of the metabolites as it compensates for errors introduced during sample pretreatment and GC-MS or LC-MS analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an effective and selective metal oxide-based affinity chromatography cleanup/enrichment method was designed and applied successfully for intracellular phosphorylated metabolites.Copyright © 2019.

PKM2 oscillates between an active tetramer and an inactive dimer. We aim to further characterize PKM2, in particular PKM2 dimer, as a urinary biomarker of bladder cancer and a potential target for treatment.HTB-9, HTB-, and UM-UC3 bladder cancer cells were assessed for proliferation under differential glucose levels using the hexosaminidase assay. Western blot and Blue-native analysis was performed for protein expression of PKM2. Shikonin, an herb that is known to bind and inhibit PKM2, was utilized to determine if PKM2 has a role in glucose usage and cellular proliferation in bladder cancer cells by caspase activity assay. Institutional review board approval was obtained to collect healthy control and bladder cancer patient urine samples. The ScheBo M2-PK EDTA Plasma Test was performed on urine samples to assess urine Tumor M2-PK values.The three bladder cancer cell lines tested all demonstrate statistically significant increases in proliferation when exposed to higher level of glucose (200mg/dL). Similarly, low doses of glucose (25mg/dL) result in reduced proliferation. Increased cell growth in higher glucose concentration correlated with up-regulation of PKM2 protein expression. Shikonin, a PKM2 inhibitor, reduced cell proliferation and switched PKM2 isoforms from the dimer to tetramer. Lastly, dimer PKM2 (Tumor-M2PK) levels were assessed in the urine samples from bladder cancer (Bca) patients and healthy controls. Tumor M2-PK significantly correlated with the presence of BCa in our subjects.Our studies demonstrate the potential of PKM2, specifically the dimer (Tumor-M2PK) as a target of drug therapy and as a urinary marker for bladder cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31197630>Quantification of pulmonary disease activity in sarcoidosis measured with F-FDG PET/CT: SUVmax versus total lung .</a></h1><p>F-FDG PET/CT has proven to be a reliable tool for therapy monitoring in sarcoidosis. Previous PET studies investigated the SUVmax as a marker for disease activity. Total lung  (TLuG) is a new tool, quantifying the  of the entire lung. Since SUVmax represents the maximum activity in only one pixel, we hypothesize that TLuG is a more accurate marker for active pulmonary disease and predictor of response than SUVmax.In this retrospective cohort study, 27 patients started on infliximab for refractory pulmonary sarcoidosis. Patients received infliximab intravenously monthly at a dose of  mg/kg. We performed a lung function test and an F-FDG PET/CT before initiation of infliximab and after 6 months of treatment. SUVmax and TLuG were determined in the pre- and post-scan. Change in lung function was correlated with the change in SUVmax and TLuG and was correlated to the initial SUVmax and TLuG to evaluate the predictive value of the initial metabolic activity.ΔSUVmax significantly correlated with ΔFVC (r = - 0.497, p = 0.008) and with ΔFEV1 (r = - 0.467, p = 0.014). Furthermore, ΔTLuG significantly correlated with ΔFVC (r = - 0.430, p = 0.025), ΔFEV1 (r = - 0.532, p = 0.004) and ΔDLCOc (r = - 0.423, p = 0.039). Change in SUVmax and TLuG significantly correlated (r = 0.735, p < 0.001). Initial SUVmax significantly correlated with the change in FVC and DLCOc. In addition, initial TLuG significantly correlated with the change in FEV1 and DLCOc. A SUVmax > 7. at initiation of infliximab was predictive for % response in FVC, whereas SUVmax > 9.2 was predictive for % response in DLCOc. In addition, high TLuG > 4100 at initiation of infliximab was predictive for % response in FVC and FEV1 and TLuG > 4500 was predictive for response in DLCOc.SUVmax and TLuG are equal in determining the response to infliximab in pulmonary sarcoidosis patients. Furthermore, SUVmax and TLuG at initiation of infliximab can predict change in lung function after treatment. Since TLuG is a more time-consuming tool, we recommend to use SUVmax of the lung parenchyma for response monitoring in pulmonary sarcoidosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470116>Engineering acetyl-CoA metabolic shortcut for eco-friendly production of polyketides triacetic acid lactone in Yarrowia lipolytica.</a></h1><p>Acetyl-CoA is the central metabolic node connecting , Krebs cycle and fatty acids synthase. Plant-derived polyketides, are assembled from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, represent a large family of biological compounds with diversified bioactivity. Harnessing microbial bioconversion is considered as a feasible approach to large-scale production of polyketides from renewable feedstocks. Most of the current polyketide production platform relied on the lengthy glycolytic steps to provide acetyl-CoA, which inherently suffers from complex regulation with metabolically-costly cofactor/ATP requirements. Using the simplest polyketide triacetic acid lactone (TAL) as a testbed molecule, we demonstrate that acetate uptake pathway in oleaginous yeast (Yarrowia lipolytica) could function as an acetyl-CoA shortcut to achieve metabolic optimality in producing polyketides. We identified the metabolic bottlenecks to rewire acetate utilization for efficient TAL production in Y. lipolytica, including generation of the driving force for acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA and NADPH. The engineered strain, with the overexpression of endogenous acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), malic enzyme (MAE1) and a bacteria-derived cytosolic pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), affords robust TAL production with titer up to 4.76 g/L from industrial glacier acetic acid in shake flasks, representing 8.-times improvement over the parental strain. The acetate-to-TAL conversion ratio (0.149 g/g) reaches 31.9% of the theoretical maximum yield. The carbon flux through this acetyl-CoA metabolic shortcut exceeds the carbon flux afforded by the native glycolytic pathways. Potentially, acetic acid could be manufactured in large-quantity at low-cost from Syngas fermentation or heterogenous catalysis (methanol carbonylation). This alternative carbon sources present a metabolic advantage over glucose to unleash intrinsic pathway limitations and achieve high carbon conversion efficiency and cost-efficiency. This work also highlights that low-cost acetic acid could be sustainably upgraded to high-value polyketides by oleaginous yeast species in an eco-friendly and cost-efficient manner.Copyright © 2019 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

For energy production, cancer cells may use 4 main fuels that are shuttled in  different metabolic pathways. Glucose fuels  that can be coupled to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in oxidative cancer cells or to lactic fermentation in proliferating and in hypoxic cancer cells. Lipids fuel lipolysis, glutamine fuels glutaminolysis, and lactate fuels the oxidative pathway of lactate, all of which are coupled to the TCA cycle and OXPHOS for energy production. This review focuses on the latter metabolic pathway.Lactate, which is prominently produced by glycolytic cells in tumors, was only recently recognized as a major fuel for oxidative cancer cells and as a signaling agent. Its exchanges across membranes are gated by monocarboxylate transporters MCT1-4. This review summarizes the current knowledge about MCT structure, regulation and functions in cancer, with a specific focus on lactate metabolism, lactate-induced angiogenesis and MCT-dependent cancer metastasis. It also describes lactate signaling via cell surface lactate receptor GPR81.Lactate and MCTs, especially MCT1 and MCT4, are important contributors to tumor aggressiveness. Analyses of MCT-deficient (MCT and MCT) animals and (MCT-mutated) humans indicate that they are druggable, with MCT1 inhibitors being in advanced development phase and MCT4 inhibitors still in the discovery phase. Imaging lactate fluxes non-invasively using a lactate tracer for positron emission tomography would further help to identify responders to the treatments.Copyright © 2019.

SF2312 can only be synthesized as a racemic-diastereomeric mixture. However, co-crystal structures with Enolase 2 (ENO2) have consistently shown that only the (3,)-enantiomer binds to the active site. The acidity of the alpha proton at C-3, which deprotonates under mildly alkaline conditions, results in racemization; thus while the separation of four enantiomeric intermediates was achieved via chiral High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) of the fully protected intermediate, deprotection inevitably nullified enantiopurity. To prevent epimerization of the C-3, we designed and synthesized MethylSF2312, ((1,-dihydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)phosphonic acid), which contains a fully-substituted C-3 alpha carbon. As a racemic-diastereomeric mixture, MethylSF2312 is equipotent to SF2312 in enzymatic and cellular systems against Enolase. Chiral HPLC separation of a protected MethylSF2312 precursor resulted in the efficient separation of the four enantiomers. After deprotection and inevitable re-equilibration of the anomeric C-, (3)-MethylSF2312 was up to 2000-fold more potent than (3)-MethylSF2312 in an isolated enzymatic assay. This observation strongly correlates with biological activity in both human cancer cells and bacteria for the 3 enantiomer of SF2312. Novel X-ray structures of human ENO2 with chiral and racemic MethylSF2312 show that only (3-enantiomer occupies the active site. Enolase inhibition is thus a direct result of binding by the (3-enantiomer of MethylSF2312. Concurrent with these results for MethylSF2312, we contend that the (3,)-SF2312 is the single active enantiomer of inhibitor SF2312.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669174>Surveillance imaging after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation predicts survival in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma.</a></h1><p>The utility of surveillance imaging after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine whether surveillance imaging predicts survival after AHCT.At the University of Minnesota, serial imaging for early relapse detection has been used prospectively for all consecutive AHCT recipients treated since 2010. This analysis included 91 AHCT recipients with DLBCL who underwent (18)F-FDG-PET at day +100 post-AHCT. (18)F-FDG-PET parameters included the Deauville (D) five-point scale, peak standardized uptake values (SUVmax), total legion  (TLG) and total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV). Survival of patients with clinically symptomatic versus asymptomatic radiographically detected relapsed DLBCL after AHCT was compared.Sixty patients experienced relapse; 35% was detected on day +100 surveillance PET scan. -year overall survival (OS) by (18)F-FDG-PET scan at day +100 post-AHCT was significantly lower in D4 and D5 patients (37%, 95% CI=14-100 and 25%, 95%CI=43-89) as compared to patients with D1 and D2 (62%, 95% CI=43-89 and 62%, 95% CI=46-84). TLG and TMTV were not prognostic. SUVmax at day +100 varied 1. (D1) to 17.9 (D5). In multivariate analysis, only SUVmax was predictive of relapse and OS; mortality increased 1.8-fold with each SUVmax doubling (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.3; p<0.01). At a median follow-up of 3.3 years (range 1-12 years), lymphoma-related mortality was 1.8-fold higher among patients whose relapse was detected clinically (symptomatic) versus radiographically on surveillance scan (HR 1.8 [95% CI 0.9 to 3.4]; p=0.08).In patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL, a routine PET imaging at day +100 post-AHCT detects asymptomatic relapse and high SUVmax identifies patients with poor expected survival of less than 1 year. Identifying this high-risk cohort can potentially highlight patients that might benefit from preemptive interventions to prevent or delay relapse.Copyright © 2019.

Endpoints analyzed included activity of enzymes involved in  (pyruvate kinase, PK; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), Krebs cycle (citrate synthase, CS; isocitrate dehydrogenase; IDH), electron transport chain (electron transport system, ETS) and pentose phosphate pathway (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PDH). Coral polyps were kept under control conditions (25.0 ± 0.1 °C; 2.9 ± 0.7 μg/L Cu) or exposed to combined treatments of increasing temperature (26.6 ± 0.1 °C and 27.3 ± 0.1 °C) and concentrations of dissolved Cu (.4 ± 0.9 and 8.6 ± 0.3 μg/L) for 4 and 12 days using a mesocosm system. PK activity was not affected by stressors. LDH, CS, IDH, ETS and G6PDH activities were temporally inhibited by stressors alone. CS, ETS and G6PDH activities remained inhibited by the combination of stressors after 12 days. Furthermore, all combinations between increasing temperature and exposure Cu were synergistic after prolonged exposure. Taken together, stressors applied alone led to temporary inhibitory effects on energy metabolism enzymes of the coral M. harttii, however, prolonged exposure reveals strong deleterious effects over the metabolism of corals due to the combination of stressors. The present study is the first one to give insights into the combined effects of increasing temperature and Cu exposure in the energy metabolism enzymes of a scleractinian coral.

Over the years, this phenomenon was extended to a number of arterial preparations of different species and revisited, from a mechanistic point of view, with the successive demonstration that it depends on calcium handling in the vascular smooth muscle cells, is endothelium-dependent and requires the production of nitric oxide (NO) by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and the activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). However, rather than the vasodilator cyclic nucleotide 3','-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), its canonical product, the latter enzyme produces 3','-cyclic inosine monophosphate (cIMP) instead during acute hypoxia; this non-canonical cyclic nucleotide facilitates the contractile process in the vascular smooth muscle cells. This 'biased' activity of soluble guanylyl cyclase appears to involve stimulation of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1).

Intratumoral acidosis and hypoxia may suppress lymphocyte proliferation and migration, and this may have important implications in modern immunotherapy.

Intense presence of TILs was noted in 42/98 cases (high TIL-score), and intense presence of PD-1 expressing TILs (high PIL-score) in 17/98 cases. PD-L1 expression was directly correlated with high PIL-score (p = 0.005). A significant inverse relationship was found between lactate dehydrogenase LDH5 expression and PIL-score (p = 0.008). Similarly, low PIL-score was significantly linked with high-hexokinase HXKII and monocarboxylate transporter MCT2 expression (p < 0.04). Cases with both intense TIL-score and PIL-score had significantly better survival (p < 0.05).

Yet little is known on how systematic shifts in metabolic networks depend on age and AD. In this work, we investigated the global metabolomic alterations in non-transgenic (NTg) and triple-transgenic (3xTg-AD) mouse brain hippocampus as a function of age by using untargeted Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS). We observed common metabolic patterns with aging in both NTg and 3xTg-AD brains involved in energy-generating pathways, fatty acids oxidation, glutamate, and sphingolipid metabolism. We found age-related downregulation of metabolites from reactions in  that consumed ATP and in the TCA cycle, especially at NAD+/NADH-dependent redox sites, where age- and AD-associated limitations in the free NADH may alter reactions. Conversely, metabolites increased in glycolytic reactions in which ATP is produced. With age, inputs to the TCA cycle were increased including fatty acid β-oxidation and glutamine. Overall age- and AD-related changes were > 2-fold when comparing the declines of upstream metabolites of NAD+/NADH-dependent reactions to the increases of downstream metabolites (p = 10-, n = 8 redox reactions). Inflammatory metabolites such as ceramides and sphingosine-1-phosphate also increased with age. Age-related decreases in glutamate, GABA, and sphingolipid were seen which worsened with AD genetic load in 3xTg-AD brains, possibly contributing to synaptic, learning- and memory-related deficits.

In addition, we provide a list of optimised assay specifications, advantages and critical steps to be considered during the process.

This work was designed to see whether DT-010 overcomes Dox resistance in resistant human breast cancer cells.  The effects of DT-010, Dox or their combination on cell viability of Dox-resistant human breast cancer MCF-7/ADR cells were conducted using 3-(4,-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry after Annexin V-FITC/PI co-staining. Dox accumulation in MCF-7/ADR cells was detected by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. A fluorometric multidrug resistance (MDR) assay kit was used to evaluate the effect of DT-010 on MDR transporter activity. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression and activity were analyzed by Western blot and rhodamine 123 (Rh123) efflux assay, respectively. The effects of DT-010 on  and mitochondrial stress were detected using an Extracellular Flux Analyzer. A Succinate Dehydrogenase Activity Assay kit was used to measure mitochondrial complex II activity.  At non-cytotoxic concentrations, DT-010 in combination with Dox led to a significant growth inhibition of MCF-7/ADR cells, suggesting a synergy between DT-010 and Dox to reverse Dox resistance. DT-010 restored Dox-mediated apoptosis and p53 induction in MCF-7/ADR cells. DT-010 increased Dox accumulation in MCF-7/ADR cells  inhibiting P-gp activity, but without changing P-gp expression. Further studies showed that DT-010 significantly inhibited  and mitochondrial function of MCF-7/ADR cells. Mitochondrial complex II activity was inhibited by DT-010 or DT-010/Dox combination, but not by Dox. The DT-010-mediated suppression of metabolic process may render cells more vulnerable to Dox treatment and thus result in enhanced efficacy.  The results indicate that DT-010 overcomes Dox resistance in human breast cancer cells through a dual action  simultaneously inhibiting P-gp-mediated drug efflux and influencing metabolic process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31395059>Volumetric parameters on F-FDG PET/CT predict the survival of patients with gastric cancer associated with their expression status of c-MET.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of volumetric parameters on F- fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in gastric-cancer patients, according to the expression status of c-MET (MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase), which was previously unclear.The study included 61 patients with advanced gastric cancer. Data on the baseline F-FDG PET/CT, clinical-pathological information, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were collected. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), peak SUV (SUV), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion  (TLG) of gastric tumors in situ were measured on PET/CT. The expression status of c-MET was recorded based on immunohistochemical staining. Associations between the parameters on PET/CT and patients' survival outcomes were analyzed in relation to expression status of c-MET.Patients with positive c-MET expression had significantly shorter PFS (11. vs. 17.6 months, P = 0.039) and OS (17.0 vs. 24.3 months, P = 0.043), and had gastric tumors with a larger MTV (70.8 ± 53.11 vs. 41.1 ± 52.32, P = 0.034) and TLG (428.39 ± 442.95 vs. 205.7 ± 354.40, P = 0.039), compared with those with negative c-MET expression. However, SUV (9.6 ± 7.40 vs. 8.0 ± 4.91, P = 0.335) and SUV (7.7 ± .99 vs. 6.62 ± 4.08, P = 0.438) were similar between these two patient groups. In patients with c-MET-positive tumors, MTV and TLG were independent factors in predicting patient OS after correction by distant metastasis (hazards ratio = 1.014 and 1.002, respectively; P = 0.024 and 0.027, respectively), while these associations were not significant in patients with c-MET-negative tumors.Patients with c-MET-positive gastric cancer had higher MTV and TLG values compared to those with c-MET-negative gastric cancer. In patients with c-MET-positive gastric cancer, volumetric parameters on F-FDG PET/CT have prognostic value for patient overall survival.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31419370>Plasma metabolites related to cellular energy metabolism are altered in adults with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.</a></h1><p>Down syndrome (DS) is a well-known neurodevelopmental disorder most commonly caused by trisomy of chromosome 21. Because individuals with DS almost universally develop heavy amyloid burden and Alzheimer's disease (AD), biomarker discovery in this population may be extremely fruitful. Moreover, any AD biomarker in DS that does not directly involve amyloid pathology may be of high value for understanding broader mechanisms of AD generalizable to the neurotypical population. In this retrospective biomarker discovery study, we examined banked peripheral plasma samples from 78 individuals with DS who met clinical criteria for AD at the time of the blood draw (DS-AD) and 68 individuals with DS who did not (DS-NAD). We measured the relative abundance of approximately ,000 putative features in the plasma using untargeted mass spectrometry (MS). We found significantly higher levels of a peak putatively annotated as lactic acid in the DS-AD group (q = .014), a finding confirmed using targeted MS (q = .011). Because lactate is the terminal product of  and subsequent lactic acid fermentation, we performed additional targeted MS focusing on central carbon metabolism which revealed significantly increased levels of pyruvic (q = .03) and methyladipic (q = .03) acids in addition to significantly lower levels of uridine (q = .007) in the DS-AD group. These data suggest that AD in DS is accompanied by a shift from aerobic respiration toward the less efficient fermentative metabolism and that bioenergetically derived metabolites observable in peripheral blood may be useful for detecting this shift.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31139900>Protein expression analysis revealed a fine-tuned mechanism of in situ detoxification pathway for the tolerant industrial yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</a></h1><p>Inhibitory compounds liberated from lignocellulose pretreatment are representative toxic chemicals that repress microbial growth and metabolism. A tolerant strain of the industrial yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to detoxify a major class of toxic compounds while producing ethanol. Knowledge on the yeast tolerance was mostly obtained by gene expression analysis and limited protein expression evidence is yet available underlying the yeast adaptation. Here we report a comparative protein expression profiling study on Y-50049, a tolerant strain compared with its parental industrial type strain Y-12632. We found a distinctive protein expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Zwf1) in Y-50049 but not in Y-12632, in the relatively conserved  and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in response to a combinational challenge of 2-furaldehyde (furfural) and -hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF). A group of proteins with aldehyde reduction activity was uniquely induced expressed in Y-50049 but not in Y-12632. Such evidence allowed fine-tuning a mechanism of the renovated in situ detoxification by Y-50049. As the key protein, Zwf1 drove the glucose metabolism in favor of the oxidative branch of the PPP facilitating in situ detoxification of the toxic chemicals by Y-50049. The activated expression of Zwf1 generated the essential cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) enabling reduction of furfural and HMF through a group of aldehyde reduction enzymes. In return, the activate aldehyde reductions released desirable feedbacks of NADP stimulating continued oxidative activity of Zwf1. Thus, a well-maintained cofactor regeneration cycle was established to restore the cofactor imbalance caused by furfural-HMF. Challenges and perspectives on adaptation of significantly differential expressions of ribosomal proteins and other unique proteins are also discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31278927>YY1/LncRNA GAS5 complex aggravates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury through enhancing neuronal .</a></h1><p>Yin-Yang 1 (YY1) has been identified as playing critical roles in multiple diseases. However, little is known regarding its roles and mechanisms in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. This study is aimed to explore the roles of YY1 in regulating neuronal apoptosis in cerebral I/R injury and its underlying mechanisms. Primary mouse cerebral cortical neurons were isolated and subjected to OGD/R to mimic cerebral I/R injury in vitro. The roles of YY1 on OGD/R-induced neuronal injury were investigated by performing western blotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, TUNEL, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, chromatin isolation by RNA purification assay, glucose uptake assay, lactate production assay, and extracellular acidification rate assay. YY1-binding long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) in neurons subjected to OGD/R were identified by RIP and RNA sequencing. The roles of YY1 on cerebral I/R in vivo were detected by assessing neuronbehaviour, infarct size, and neuronal apoptosis. We found that YY1 expression is downregulated, and LncRNA GAS5 is upregulated in neurons subjected to OGD/R. OGD/R treatment promotes YY1 interacting with GAS5 in neurons, and YY1 negatively regulates GAS5 expression by binding to GAS5 promoter to repress its transcription. Besides, YY1 and GAS5 bind to the same region of PFKFB3 promoter to promote PFKFB3 expression and strengthen neuronal , resulting in aggravating OGD/R-induced neuronal apoptosis. Knockdown of YY1 or GAS5 protects against I/R-induced ischemic brain damage and improves overall neurological functions in vivo. Overall, YY1 interacts with LncRNA GAS5 to promote PFKFB3 transcription to enhance neuronal , resulting in aggravating cerebral I/R injury.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

For each patient, we calculated the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion  (TLG) on pretreatment F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Using the Cox proportional hazards model, we evaluated the relationships among potential MPM predictors, including age, gender, performance status, histologic type, stage, possible serum markers, and volume-based positron emission tomography parameters, as well as overall survival.The median survival was 461 days, and the 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 60.70% and 31.10%, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the significant independent predictors of poor survival outcomes were the non-epithelioid histologic type, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of ≥ .0, and a TLG of ≥ 525 g. We then used these results to develop a prognostic risk classification system. From the resulting survival curve, we found a significant difference among the 3 risk groups of independent variables. Moreover, there were significant differences between all pairs of 2 separated risk groups.Pathologic subtypes, serum lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and TLG in F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography were independent and significant prognostic factors of MPM. Using this model, we created a new risk classification system that supplants the standard TNM staging protocol.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Methods The spleen-derived MDSCs of lung cancer xenograft mice were isolated by immunomagnetic beads. After treated by Lewis tumor cell conditioned medium (TCCM) for 48 hours, real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA levels of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). The hexokinase (HK) method was used to detect the concentration of glucose; the lactic acid test kit was used to detect the content of lactic acid which was the final production of ; and the , 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimiyl ester (CFSE) staining combined with flow cytometry was used to detect the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs on the proliferation of CD4 T cells. Arginase kit was used to detect arginase 1 (ARG1) activity of MDSCs, and nitric oxide kit was used to detect the level of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Results Compared with the untreated group, the mRNA levels of LDHA, GLUT1 and HIF-1α were up-regulated; the activity of ARG1 and the level of iNOS significantly increased; the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs on the proliferation of CD4 T cells was significantly enhanced after the treatment of TCCM.

This study aimed at determining whether metabolomics could provide molecular insight to explain the "dormancy syndrome" by highlighting functional pathways and metabolites, hence offering a novel comprehensive molecular view of dormancy. We compared the metabolome of morphologically distinct dormant encysted embryos (resting eggs) and non-dormant embryos (amictic eggs) of a rotifer (Brachionus plicatilis). Metabolome profiling revealed ~,000 features, 1,079 of which were annotated. Most of the features were represented at significantly higher levels in non-dormant than dormant embryos. A large number of features was assigned to putative functional pathways indicating novel differences between dormant and non-dormant states. These include features associated with , the TCA and urea cycles, amino acid, purine and pyrimidine metabolism. Interestingly, ATP, nucleobases, cyclic nucleotides, thymidine and uracil, were not detected in dormant resting eggs, suggesting an impairment of response to environmental and internal cues, cessation of DNA synthesis, transcription and plausibly translation in the dormant embryos. The levels of trehalose or its analogues, with a role in survival under desiccation conditions, were higher in resting eggs. In conclusion, the current study highlights metabolomics as a major analytical tool to functionally compare dormancy across species.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287846>Metabolic requirements of human pro-inflammatory B cells in aging and obesity.</a></h1><p>The subset of pro-inflammatory B cells, called late memory, tissue-like or double negative (DN), accumulates in the blood of elderly individuals. Here we show that DN B cells do not proliferate and do not make antibodies to influenza antigens, but they secrete antibodies with autoimmune reactivity, in agreement with their membrane phenotype (CD95+CD21-CD11c+) and their spontaneous expression of the transcription factor T-bet. These cells also increase in the blood of individuals with obesity and autoimmune diseases, but causative mechanisms and signaling pathways involved are known only in part. In the present paper we compare frequencies and metabolic requirements of these cells in the blood of healthy individuals of different ages and in the blood and the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of individuals with obesity. Results show that DN B cells from young individuals have minimal metabolic requirements, DN B cells from elderly and obese individuals utilize higher amounts of glucose to perform autoimmune antibody production and enroll in aerobic  to support their function. DN B cells from the SAT have the highest metabolic requirements as they activate oxidative phosphorylation, aerobic  and fatty acid oxidation. DN B cells from the SAT also show the highest levels of ROS and the highest levels of phosphorylated AMPK ('-AMP activated kinase) and Sestrin 1, both able to mitigate stress and cell death. This metabolic advantage drives DN B cell survival and function (secretion of autoimmune antibodies).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624314>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery restores insulin-mediated glucose partitioning and mitochondrial dynamics in primary myotubes from severely obese humans.</a></h1><p>Impaired insulin-mediated glucose partitioning is an intrinsic metabolic defect in skeletal muscle from severely obese humans (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery has been shown to improve glucose metabolism in severely obese humans. The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of RYGB surgery on glucose partitioning, mitochondrial network morphology, and the markers of mitochondrial dynamics skeletal muscle from severely obese humans.Human skeletal muscle cells were isolated from muscle biopsies obtained from RYGB patients (BMI = 48.0 ± 2.1, n = 7) prior to, 1 month and 7 months following surgery and lean control subjects (BMI = 22.4 ± 1.1, n = 7). Complete glucose oxidation, non-oxidized  rates, mitochondrial respiratory capacity, mitochondrial network morphology, and the regulatory proteins of mitochondrial dynamics were determined in differentiated human myotubes.Myotubes derived from severely obese humans exhibited enhanced glucose oxidation (13.%; 95% CI [7.6, 19.4], P = 0.043) and reduced non-oxidized  (-1.3%; 95% CI [-11.1, 8.6]) in response to insulin stimulation at 7 months after RYGB when compared with the presurgery state (-0.6%; 95% CI [-.2, 4.0] and 19.%; 95% CI [4.0, 35.0], P = 0.006), and were not different from the lean controls (16.7%; 95% CI [11.8, 21.] and 1.9%; 95% CI [-1.6, .4], respectively). Further, the number of fragmented mitochondria and Drp1(Ser) phosphorylation were trended to reduce/reduced (0.0104, 95% CI [0.0085, 0.0126], P = 0.091 and 0.0085, 95% CI [0.0068, 0.0102], P = 0.05) in myotubes derived from severely obese humans at 7 months after RYGB surgery in comparison with the presurgery state. Finally, Drp1(Ser) phosphorylation was negatively correlated with insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation (r = -0.49, P = 0.037).These data indicate that an intrinsic metabolic defect of glucose partitioning in skeletal muscle from severely obese humans is restored by RYGB surgery. The restoration of glucose partitioning may be regulated through reduced mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 phosphorylation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31424145>Feasibility of neurochemically profiling mouse embryonic brain and its development in utero using  H MRS at 14.1 T.</a></h1><p>We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of neurochemical profiling of embryonic mouse brain developments in utero and to seek potential in vivo evidence of an energy shift in a mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1) deficient mouse model. C57BL/6 embryonic mouse brains were studied in utero by anatomical MRI and short echo localized proton ( H) MRS at 14.1 T. Two embryonic stages were studied, the energy shift (e.g., embryonic day 12.-13, E12.-13) and close to the birth (E17.-18). In addition, embryonic brains devoid of MPC1 were studied at E12.-13. The MRI provided sufficient anatomical contrasts for visualization of embryonic brain. Localized  H MRS offered abundant metabolites through the embryonic development from E12. and close to the birth, e.g., E17. and beyond. The abundant neurochemical information at E12. provided metabolic status and processes relating to cellular development at this stage, i.e., the energy shift from  to oxidative phosphorylation, evidenced by accumulation of lactate in E12.-13 embryonic brain devoid of MPC1. The further evolution of the neurochemical profile of embryonic brains at E17.-18 is consistent with cellular and metabolic processes towards the birth. Localized  H MRS study of embryonic brain development in utero is feasible, and longitudinal neurochemical profiling of embryonic brains offers valuable insight into early brain development.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31251971>2,3'4,4',-Pentachlorobiphenyl induces hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation through pyruvate kinase M2-dependent .</a></h1><p>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are classic persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and are associated with the progression of many cancers, including liver cancer.

Intratumor heterogeneity derived from fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is a potential predictor of treatment outcomes and the prognosis of breast cancer. However, the presence of multiple lesions and complex calculation methods leads to difficulties in the clinical use of this parameter for metastatic breast cancer. The aim of this study is to provide a convenient and effective measurement of intratumor heterogeneity to predict treatment outcomes for mTNBC patients with lung metastasis.  We enrolled mTNBC patients with lung metastasis who underwent F-FDG PET/CT scans before ﬁrst-line therapy from three clinical trials (,  and ). Apart from the regular FDG parameters, including standard uptake value (SUV), total lesion  (TLG) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV), we defined the lung index as the SUVmean divided by the difference between the SUVmax and SUVmean for the targeted lung lesion. The MTV was automatically exported from the manual delineation using software based on an adaptive threshold of SUV intensity >2. within the contouring margin. The TLG was calculated using the following formula: TLG=SUVmean×MTV. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazard model.  The data from 31 patients were available for analysis. The median PFS of low-lung index (LI) patients was 8.1 months, which was significantly longer than that of high-LI patients (HR=3.3, 95% CI 1.-7.3, =0.003). Patients with low TLG had a significantly better PFS than those with high TLG (HR=2.6, 95% CI 1.2-.8, =0.014). Patients with low TLG had significantly longer overall survival than those with high TLG (31.2 months vs 13.9 months, HR=3.1, 95% CI 1.2-8.6, =0.029). Multivariate analysis confirmed the predictive value of LI and TLG.  This study proposed a new "PET biopsy" method to evaluate the intratumor heterogeneity of mTNBC on pretreatment F-FDG PET/CT scans and indicated the predictive value of LI and TLG for first-line platinum-based treatment outcomes and overall survival. These findings could help clinicians recognize patients who are likely to not only have a favorable response to platinum-based therapy but also a good prognosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471554>The role of  and mitochondrial respiration in the formation and functioning of endothelial tip cells during angiogenesis.</a></h1><p>During sprouting angiogenesis, an individual endothelial tip cell grows out from a pre-existing vascular network and guides following and proliferating stalk cells to form a new vessel. Metabolic pathways such as  and mitochondrial respiration as the major sources of adenosine '-triphosphate (ATP) for energy production are differentially activated in these types of endothelial cells (ECs) during angiogenesis. Therefore, we studied energy metabolism during angiogenesis in more detail in tip cell and non-tip cell human umbilical vein ECs. Small interfering RNA was used to inhibit transcription of glycolytic enzymes PFKFB3 or LDHA and mitochondrial enzyme PDHA1 to test whether inhibition of these specific pathways affects tip cell differentiation and sprouting angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. We show that  is essential for tip cell differentiation, whereas both  and mitochondrial respiration occur during proliferation of non-tip cells and in sprouting angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration causes adaptation of EC metabolism by increasing  and vice versa. In conclusion, our studies show a complex but flexible role of the different metabolic pathways to produce ATP in the regulation of tip cell and non-tip cell differentiation and functioning during sprouting angiogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513460>Systematic Review: Clinical Metabolomics to Forecast Outcomes in Liver Transplantation Surgery.</a></h1><p>Liver transplantation is an effective intervention for end-stage liver disease, fulminant hepatic failure, and early hepatocellular carcinoma. Yet, there is marked patient-to-patient variation in liver transplantation outcomes. This calls for novel diagnostics to enable rational deployment of donor livers. Metabolomics is a postgenomic high-throughput systems biology approach to diagnostic innovation in clinical medicine. We report here an original systematic review of the metabolomic studies that have identified putative biomarkers in the context of liver transplantation. Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria that involved sampling of blood ( = 4), dialysate fluid ( = 4), bile ( = ), and liver tissue ( = ). Metabolites of amino acid and nitrogen metabolism, anaerobic , lipid breakdown products, and bile acid metabolism were significantly different in transplanted livers with and without graft dysfunction. However, criteria for defining the graft dysfunction varied across studies. This systematic review demonstrates that metabolomics can be deployed in identification of metabolic indicators of graft dysfunction with a view to implicated molecular mechanisms. We conclude the article with a horizon scanning of metabolomics technology in liver transplantation and its future prospects and challenges in research and clinical practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135122>PKM2 Knockdown Induces Autophagic Cell Death via AKT/mTOR Pathway in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.</a></h1><p>Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is essential for aerobic . Although high PKM2 expression is observed in various cancer tissues, its functional role in cancer metabolism is unclear. Here, we investigated the role of PKM2 in regulating autophagy and its associated pathways in prostate cancer cells.Immunohistochemistry was performed to compare the expression level of PKM2 in prostate cancer patients and normal human, whereas expression of PKM2 in several cell lines was also examined by using western blot. PKM2 expression was silenced using various small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Cell viability was examined using IncuCyte ZOOM™ live cell imaging system. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were performed to investigate the PKM2 knockdown on other cellular signaling molecules. Acridine orange and Monodansylcadaverine staining was performed to check effect of PKM2 knockdown on autophagy induction. High performance thin layer chromatography was carried out to quantify the level of different cellular metabolites (pyruvate and lactate). Colony formation assay was performed to determine the ability of a cells to form large colonies.PKM2 was highly expressed in prostate cancer patients as compared to normal human. PKM2 siRNA-transfected prostate cancer cells showed significantly reduced viability. Acridine orange, Monodansylcadaverine staining and western blotting analysis showed that PKM2 downregulation markedly increased autophagic cell death. Results of western blotting analysis showed that PKM2 knockdown affected protein kinase B/mechanistic target of rapamycin 1 pathway, which consequently downregulated the expression of glycolytic enzymes lactate dehydrogenase A and glucose transporter 1. Knockdown of PKM2 also reduced the colony formation ability of human prostate cancer cell DU145.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that PKM2 inhibition alters prostate cancer cell metabolism and induces autophagy, thus providing new perspectives for developing PKM2-targeting anticancer therapies for treating prostate cancer.© Copyright by the Author(s).
