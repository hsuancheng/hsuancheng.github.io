<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22146717>Tobacco salicylic  glucosyltransferase is active toward tuberonic  ( ) and is induced by mechanical wounding stress.</a></h2><p>Recently we reported that rice salicylic  (SA) glucosyltransferase (OsSGT) is active toward   (tuberonic , TA) and that OsSGT gene expression is induced by wounding stress. Here we report that tobacco SA glucosyltransferase (NtSGT), which is thought to be an ortholog of OsSGT, is also active toward TA. Although NtSGT expression is known to be induced by biotrophic stress, it was also induced by wounding stress in the same manner as OsSGT. These results indicate that this glucosyltransferase is important not only in biotrophic stress but also for wounding stress. It was found that this enzyme is dually functional, with activity both toward TA and SA.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15666542>Effects of theobroxide, a natural product, on the level of endogenous jasmonoids.</a></h2><p>The natural potato microtuber inducing substance, theobroxide, strongly induces the formation of tuber of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and flower bud of morning glory (Pharbitis nil) plants under non-inducing conditions (long days) (Yoshihara et al., 2000). In the present study, theobroxide was evaluated for its effect on the level of endogenous jasmonoids in different tissues of such two plants. An in vitro bioassay using cultures of single-node segments of potato stems was performed with the supplement of theobroxide in the medium. The endogenous jasmonic  (JA) and its analogue tuberonic  (TA,  ) in segments and microtubers were quantitatively analyzed. The increase in the endogenous JA level caused by theobroxide was observed in both segments and microtubers. Endogenous TA was only detected in segments, and the content increased with the concentration of theobroxide. As for morning glory, the whole plant was sprayed with theobroxide for 1 approximately 5 weeks under different photoperiods and endogenous JA in the leaves was quantitatively analyzed. Theobroxide spraying increased the level of endogenous JA in the leaves of the plants grown under both long and short days.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637544>Biochemical and molecular characterization of a hydroxyjasmonate sulfotransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana.</a></h2><p>12-Hydroxyjasmonate, also known as tuberonic , was first isolated from Solanum tuberosum and was shown to have tuber-inducing properties. It is derived from the ubiquitously occurring jasmonic , an important signaling molecule mediating diverse developmental processes and plant defense responses. We report here that the gene AtST2a from Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a hydroxyjasmonate sulfotransferase. The recombinant AtST2a protein was found to exhibit strict specificity for 11- and 12-hydroxyjasmonate with K(m) values of 50 and 10 microm, respectively. Furthermore, 12-hydroxyjasmonate and its sulfonated derivative are shown to be naturally occurring in A. thaliana. The exogenous application of methyljasmonate to A. thaliana plants led to increased levels of both metabolites, whereas treatment with 12-hydroxyjasmonate led to increased level of 12-hydroxyjasmonate sulfate without affecting the endogenous level of jasmonic . AtST2a expression was found to be induced following treatment with methyljasmonate and 12-hydroxyjasmonate. In contrast, the expression of the methyljasmonate-responsive gene Thi2.1, a marker gene in plant defense responses, is not induced upon treatment with 12-hydroxyjasmonate indicating the existence of independent signaling pathways responding to jasmonic  and  . Taken together, the results suggest that the hydroxylation and sulfonation reactions might be components of a pathway that inactivates excess jasmonic  in plants. Alternatively, the function of AtST2a might be to control the biological activity of  .</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA']</p></html>
