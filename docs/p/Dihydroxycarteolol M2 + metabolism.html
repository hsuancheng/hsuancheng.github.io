Despite the direct evidence that PQ could induce inflammatory responses in central nervous system and largely contribute to neurotoxicity, the putative adverse effects of PQ on the neuroimmune interactions have rarely been investigated. Therefore, the present study investigated underlying mechanisms of PQ-induced inflammatory response in BV-2 microglia cells. Proliferation, migration and phagocytosis of BV-2 cells upon PQ exposure were first investigated to demonstrate that PQ did stimulate BV-2 microglia into an active phenotype. Increased microglia M1 markers expression and decreased microglia  markers expression confirmed that PQ induces BV-2 cells towards M1 activation. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were determined using ELISA and western blotting assays, showing that paraquat significantly promote the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). The up-regulation of TLR4/MyD88 protein expressions and enhanced translocation of NF-κB p65 protein upon PQ exposure were further demonstrated. Taken together, our results suggested that PQ induces M1 microglia polarization by increased production of pro-inflammatory molecules, which could be explained by the activation of the TLR4-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, data on breast milk composition and its relation with growth are sparse.We investigated whether short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), known to be present in HM and linked to energy , are associated with infancy anthropometrics.In a prospective birth cohort, HM hindmilk samples were collected from 619 lactating mothers at 4-8 wk postnatally [median (IQR) age: 33.9 (31.3-36.5) y, body mass index (BMI) (kg/): 22.8 (20.9-25.2)]. Their offspring, born at 40.1 (39.1-41.0) wk gestation with weight 3.56 (3.22-3.87) kg and 51% male, were assessed with measurement of weight, length, and skinfold thickness at ages 3, 12, and 24 mo, and transformed to age- and sex-adjusted z scores. HM SCFAs were measured by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and GC-MS. Multivariable linear regression models were conducted to analyze the relations between NMR HM SCFAs and infancy growth parameters with adjustment for potential confounders.NMR peaks for HM butyrate, acetate, and formic acid, but not propionate, were detected. Butyrate peaks were 17.8% higher in HM from exclusively breastfeeding mothers than mixed-feeding mothers (P = 0.003). HM butyrate peak values were negatively associated with changes in infant weight (standardized B  = -0.10, P = 0.019) and BMI (B = -0.10, P = 0.018) between 3 and 12 mo, and negatively associated with BMI (B = -0.10, P = 0.018) and mean skinfold thickness (B = -0.10, P = 0.049) at age 12 mo. HM formic acid peak values showed a consistent negative association with infant BMI at all time points (B < = -0.10, P < = 0.014), whereas HM acetate was negatively associated with skinfold thickness at 3 mo (B = -0.10, P = 0.028) and 24 mo (B = -0.10, P = 0.036).These results suggest that HM SCFAs play a beneficial role in weight gain and adiposity during infancy. Further knowledge of HM SCFA function may inform future strategies to support healthy growth.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31372790>PK--mediated  changes in breast cancer cells induced by ionizing radiation.</a></h2><p>Radiotherapy (RT) constitutes an important part of breast cancer treatment. However, triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) exhibit remarkable resistance to most therapies, including RT. Developing new ways to radiosensitize TNBC cells could result in improved patient outcomes. The  isoform of pyruvate kinase (PK-) is believed to be responsible for the re-wiring of cancer cell  after oxidative stress. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of ionizing radiation (IR) on PK--mediated  changes in TNBC cells, and their survival. In addition, we determine the effect of PK- activators on breast cancer stem cells, a radioresistant subpopulation of breast cancer stem cells.Glucose uptake, lactate production, and glutamine consumption were assessed. The cellular localization of PK- was evaluated by western blot and confocal microscopy. The small molecule activator of PK-, TEPP46, was used to promote its pyruvate kinase function. Finally, effects on cancer stem cell were evaluated via sphere forming capacity.Exposure of TNBC cells to IR increased their glucose uptake and lactate production. As expected, PK- expression levels also increased, especially in the nucleus, although overall pyruvate kinase activity was decreased. PK- nuclear localization was shown to be associated with breast cancer stem cells, and activation of PK- by TEPP46 depleted this population.Radiotherapy can induce  changes in TNBC cells, and these changes seem to be mediated, at least in part by PK-. Importantly, our results show that activators of PK- can deplete breast cancer stem cells in vitro. This study supports the idea of combining PK- activators with radiation to enhance the effect of radiotherapy in resistant cancers, such as TNBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31268904>Metformin improved oxidized low-density lipoprotein-impaired mitochondrial function and increased glucose uptake involving Akt-AS160 pathway in raw264.7 macrophages.</a></h2><p>Macrophage accumulation in the vascular wall is a hallmark of atherosclerosis. Studies showed that shifting of oxidized lipids-induced inflammatory macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype by promoting oxidative  attenuated atherosclerosis progression. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether metformin, which has ameliorated atherosclerosis in animal models and clinical trials, modulated oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) induced inflammatory status in macrophages by regulating cellular oxidative .Murine raw264.7 macrophages were incubated with Ox-LDL (50 μg/mL) in the presence or absence of metformin (15 μmol/L) for 24 h. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the transcription of classically activated (M1) pro-inflammatory and alternatively activated () anti-inflammatory markers and mitochondrial DNA copy numbers. Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane potential were detected by immunofluorescence. Cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, glucose uptake, and lactic acid production were measured by commercial kit and normalized to cellular lysates. Western blotting analysis was performed to detect the expression of mitochondrial fusion/fission related proteins, enzymes mediating lipid  and signaling pathway of glucose transport. Differences between groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance.Metformin improved Ox-LDL-impaired anti-inflammatory phenotype in raw264.7 macrophages as shown by up-regulated transcription of anti-inflammatory markers including interleukin 10 (0.76 ± 0.04 vs. 0.94 ± 0.01, P = 0.003) and Resistin-like molecule alpha (0.67 ± 0.08 vs. 1.78 ± 0.34, P = 0.030). Conversely, Ox-LDL-diminished phosphorylation of Akt was up-regulated by metformin treatment (0.47 ± 0.05 vs. 1.02 ± 0.08, P = 0.040), associated with an improvement of mitochondrial function, characterized by decreased ROS generation (2.50 ± 0.07 vs. 2.15 ± 0.04, P = 0.040), increased lipid oxidation, and elevated cellular ATP production (0.026 ± 0.001 vs. 0.035 ± 0.003, P = 0.020). Moreover, metformin-mediated Akt activation increased Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) phosphorylation (0.51 ± 0.04 vs. 1.03 ± 0.03, P = 0.0041), promoted membrane translocation of glucose transporter 1, and increased glucose influx into the cells (4.78 ± 0.04 vs. 5.47 ± 0.01, P < 0.001).This study suggested that targeting macrophage  with new or existing drugs had therapeutic potential for the prevention and treatment of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082342>[An analysis of the serological characteristics of anti-mitochondrial  subtype in patients with drug-induced liver injury and primary biliary cholangitis].</a></h2><p> To analyze the serological characteristics of anti-mitochondrial antibody  subtype (AMA-) in patients with drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), in order to provide reference for clinical differential diagnosis.  Laboratory data of 2802 DILI cases who visited the hospital between January 2011 and December 2017 were retrospectively collected. AMA- positive patients were analyzed with respect to laboratorical findings, and serum data of 120 patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) at the same period was taken as a control. A chi-square test was used for group comparisons. One-way ANOVA and rank sum tests was used for ALT, AST, ALP, GGT and three groups of immunoglobulin M.  Among 2802 DILI patients, AMA- positive rate was 5.1% (144/2 802), 77.1% (111/144) was DILI alone, 22.2% (32/144) was DILI with PBC, and 0.7% (1/144) was DILI with Sjogren's syndrome. An AMA- level in DILI alone group was mostly mild and moderate than the PBC group and the DILI combined with the PBC group. There was significant difference between the two groups ( < 0.05).There was no significant difference in AMA- levels between DILI group combined with PBC group and PBC group ( > 0.05). ALT and AST levels of DILI alone group and DILI combined with PBC were (585.92 ± 653.04) U/L, (501.45 ± 512.67) U/L and (373.47 ± 502.60) U/L, (335.97 ± 513.96) U/L, respectively, which were significantly higher than PBC group [(106.33 + 134.08) U/L, (112.59 + 152.20) U/L]. There were statistically significant differences between the two groups ( < 0.05).The ALP level of DILI alone group was (152.58 + 81.46) U/L, which was lower than PBC group (237.86 + 215.09). The difference was statistically significant ( < 0.05). The level of immunoglobulin M in the DILI alone group was (1.76 ± 1.16) g/L, which was lower than PBC group (4.74 ± 5.74) g/L and the DILI combined with the PBC group (3.31 ± 1.68) g/L. There was significant difference between the two groups. During follow-up, 2.7% of patients with DILI had cirrhosis, 42.3% had lower AMA- titer, 14.4% had lower AMA- titer, 13.5% had higher AMA- titer and five cases developed PBC.  AMA- is not only positive in patients with PBC, but also low-to-medium or even high-level AMA- may be detected in DILI patients. For AMA--positive DILI patients, it is necessary to identify whether they are associated with PBC. Secondly, the levels of ALT, AST and ALP should be analyzed, and the patients should be on regular follow up for early and timely detection of drug-induced PBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31469100>Glycolytic reprogramming in cancer cells: PKM2 dimer predominance induced by pulsatile PFK-1 activity.</a></h2><p>The glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) exists in both catalytically inactive dimeric and active tetrameric forms. In cancer cells, PKM2 dimer predominance contributes to tumor growth by triggering glycolytic reprogramming. However, the mechanism that promotes PKM2 dimer predominance over tetramer in cancer cells remains elusive. Here, we show that pulsatile phosphofructokinase (PFK-1) activity results in PKM2 dimer predominance. Mathematical simulations predict that pulsatile PFK-1 activity prevents the formation of PKM2 tetramer even under high levels of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), a PKM2 tetramer-promoting metabolite produced by PFK-1. We experimentally confirm these predictions at the single-molecule level by providing evidence for pulsatile PFK-1 activity-induced synchronized dissociation of PKM2 tetramers and the subsequent accumulation of PKM2 dimers under high levels of FBP in HeLa cells. Moreover, we show that pulsatile PFK-1 activity-induced PKM2 dimer predominance also controls cell proliferation. Thus, our study reveals the significance of pulsatile PFK-1 activity in cancer cell .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31478346>Skewed macrophage polarization in aging skeletal muscle.</a></h2><p>Skeletal muscle aging is a major cause of disability and frailty in the elderly. The progressive impairment of skeletal muscle function with aging was recently linked to a disequilibrium between damage and repair. Macrophages participate in muscle tissue repair, first as pro-inflammatory M1 subtype and then as anti-inflammatory  subtype. However, information on the presence of macrophages in skeletal muscle is still sporadic and the effect of aging on macrophage phenotype remains unknown. In this study, we sought to characterize the polarization status of macrophages in skeletal muscle of persons across a wide range of ages. We found that most macrophages in human skeletal muscle are , and that this number increased with advancing age. On the contrary, M1 macrophages declined with aging, making the total number of macrophages invariant with older age. Notably,  macrophages colocalized with increasing intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) in aging skeletal muscle. Similarly, aged BALB/c mice showed increased IMAT and  macrophages in skeletal muscle, accompanied by slightly increased collagen protein production. Collectively, we report that polarization of macrophages to the major  subtype is associated with IMAT and propose that increased  in aged skeletal muscle may impact upon muscle  associated with aging.© 2019 The Authors.

It was hypothesized that TEE would differ according to body mass, body composition, and physical activity level (PAL) and current energy recommendations would have poor individual-level accuracy.Patients with newly diagnosed CRC had resting energy expenditure (REE) measured by indirect calorimetry and TEE by doubly labeled water. Hypermetabolism was defined as REE > 110% of that predicted from the Mifflin St.-Jeor equation. Body composition was assessed via DXA. Physical activity was determined as the ratio of TEE to REE (TEE:REE) (PAL) and residual activity energy expenditure (RAEE). TEE was compared with energy recommendations of 25-30 kcal/d and Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) using Bland-Altman analyses. Patients were stratified according to median BMI, PAL, and sex-specific ratio of fat mass (FM) to fat-free mass (FFM).Twenty-one patients (M:F 14:7; mean ± SD BMI: 28.3 ± 4.9 kg/, age: 57 ± 12 y) were included. Most (n = 20) had stage II-III disease; 1 had stage IV. Approximately half (n = 11) were hypermetabolic; TEE was not different in those with hypermetabolism and REE as a percentage of predicted was not correlated with TEE. Mean ± SD TEE was 2473 ± 499 kcal/d (range: 1562-3622 kcal/d), or 29.7 ± 6.3 kcal/kg body weight (range: 20.4-48.5 kcal/kg body weight). Mean ± SD PAL was 1.43 ± 0.27. The energy recommendation of 25 kcal/kg underestimated TEE (-12.6% ± 16.5%, P = 0.002); all energy recommendations had wide limits of agreement (the smallest was DRI with measured PAL: -21.2% to 29.3%). Patients with higher BMI and FM:FFM had higher bias using kilocalories per kilogram recommendations; bias from several recommendations was frequently lower (i.e. underestimation) in patients with higher PAL and RAEE.TEE variability was not reflected in energy recommendations and error was related to body weight, body composition, and physical activity.

Harvesting via an integrative holistic approach is recommended for optimal quality and functional compounds. Fruits at dark green (M1), light green (), colour break or pink (M3), red (M4), dark red (M5) stages were harvested in 2016 and 2017 seasons. The principal component analysis illustrated the colour value a* (redness), fruit weight, size (length and width), sugars (glucose and fructose), ascorbic acid content, cyanidin derivatives (cyanidin-3-O-pyranoside, cyanidin 3-O-β-sambubioside, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside), naringenin 4'-O-glucoside, and antioxidant property (FRAP) were higher in the following order of maturity stages M5 > M4 > M3 >  > M1. Quercetin 3-O-rhamnosyl galactoside and glucoside were higher in green (h° higher) firm M1 to M3 stages. A strong correlation exists between fruit weight, size, a* value and cyanidin derivatives or naringenin 4'-O-glucoside or ascorbic acid content or antioxidant activity. Thus, the M4 and M5 stages of Natal plum can serve as functional food.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Monocytes, which may be classified into classical (CD14, CD16), intermediate (CD14, CD16) and non-classical (CD14, CD16) subtypes in humans and non-human primates (NHPs), and monocyte-derived macrophages may play an integral role in the pathogenesis of RIF. We tested the hypothesis that moderate to high levels of total-body exposure to radiation would alter monocyte polarization and produce phenotypes that could promote multi-organ fibrosis in a wellestablished NHP model of DEARE. Subjects were 16 young adult male rhesus macaques, ten of which were exposed to high-energy, 4 Gy X-ray total-body irradiation (TBI) and six that received sham irradiation (control). Total monocytes assessed by complete blood counts were 89% depleted in TBI animals by day 9 postirradiation ( < 0.05), but recovered by day 30 postirradiation and did not differ from control levels thereafter. Monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sorted into classical, intermediate and non-classical subsets using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) prior to and at 6 months post-TBI. At 6 months postirradiation, monocyte polarization shifted towards lower classical (92% → 86%) and higher intermediate (7% → 12%) and non-classical monocyte subsets (0.6% → 2%) (all  < 0.05) in TBI animals compared to baseline. No change in monocyte subsets was observed in control animals. Transcriptional profiles in classical and intermediate monocyte subsets were assessed using RNAseq. Classical monocyte gene expression did not change significantly over time or differ cross-sectionally between TBI and control groups. In contrast, significant numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in intermediate monocyte comparisons between the TBI animals and all animals at baseline (304 DEGs), and in the TBI versus control animals at 6 months postirradiation (67 DEGs). Intermediate monocytes also differed between baseline and 6 months in control animals (147 DEGs). Pathway analysis was used to identify genes within significant canonical , yielding 52 DEGs that were specific to irradiated intermediate monocytes. These DEGs and significant canonical  were associated with pro-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory signaling  that have been noted to induce  macrophage polarization. These findings support the hypothesis that TBI may alter monocyte programming and polarization towards a profibrotic phenotype, providing a novel target opportunity for therapies to inhibit or prevent RIF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31368246>Characterization of stable and reactive metabolites of piperine formed on incubation with human liver microsomes.</a></h2><p>Black pepper, though commonly employed as a spice, has many medicinal properties. It consists of volatile oils, alkaloids, pungent resins, etc., of which piperine is a major constituent. Though safe at low doses, piperine causes alteration in the activity of drug metabolising enzymes and transporters at high dose and is known to precipitate liver toxicity. It has a potential to form reactive metabolite(s) (RM) owing to the presence of structural alerts, such as methylenedioxyphenyl (MDP), α, β-unsaturated carbonyl group (Michael acceptor), and piperidine. The present study was designed to detect and characterize stable and RM(s) of piperine formed on in vitro incubation with human liver microsomes. The investigation of RMs was done with the aid of trapping agents, viz, glutathione (GSH) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The samples were analysed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) using Thermo Scientific Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap. Full scan MS followed by data-dependent MS (Full MS-ddMS ) mode was used to establish mass spectrometric fragmentation  of protonated piperine and its metabolites. In total, four stable metabolites and their isomers (M1a-c, M2a-b, M3a-c, and M4a-b) were detected. Their formation involved removal of carbon (3, M1a-c), hydroxylation (2, M2a-b), hydroxylation with hydrogenation (3, M3a-c), and dehydrogenation (2, M4a-b). Out of these metabolites, M1, , and M3 are reported earlier in the literature, but their isomers and two M4 variants are novel. In addition, six novel conjugates of RMs, including three GSH conjugates of m/z 579 and three NAC conjugates of m/z 435, were also observed.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31106533>[Effect of Human Adipose Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Phenotype Polarization of Mice Microglia via TLR3/TRIF Signal Pathway].</a></h2><p>To explore the effect and mechanism of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSCs) on phenotypic polarization of microglia.BV-2 microglia of C57/BL6 mice were co-cultured with hADMSCs+lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or cultured with LPS alone.

The impact of hADMSCs on microglia M1/ phenotype markers were detected using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). The affect of hADMSCs on the proteins expression levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-TIR domain containing adaptor protein inducing interferon β (TRIF) signaling pathway in BV-2 microglia was detected by using Western blot analysis.As compared with the LPS treatment, hADMSCs treatment had no obvious effect on microglia morphology, whereas showed significant inhibition on microglial proliferation activity (<0.05). Simultaneously, hADMSCs treatment reduced expression of microglia M1 phenotype markers (<0.05), and increased microglia M1 phenotype markers in gene levels (<0.05). At the same time, protein expression levels of TRIF, TLR4, phosphorylated interferon regulatory factor 3 (P-IRF3) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) in BV-2 microglia were decreased after hADMSCs treatment.hADMSCs can blockade the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory microglia M1 phenotype, whereas induces protective microglial  phenotype, which may be related to inhibition of the TLR4-TRIF signaling pathway.Copyright© by Editorial Board of Journal of Sichuan University (Medical Science Edition).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034018>Body Mass Index and Mortality in Individuals With Type 1 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>The relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mortality may differ between patients with type 1 diabetes and the general population; it is not known which clinical characteristics modify the relationship.Our aim was to assess the relationship between BMI and mortality and the interaction with clinically meaningful factors.This prospective study included 5836 individuals with type 1 diabetes from the FinnDiane study.We retrieved death data for all participants on 31 December 2015. We estimated the effect of BMI on the risk of mortality using a Cox proportional hazards model with BMI as a restricted cubic spline as well as effect modification by adding interaction terms to the spline.During a median of 13.7 years, 876 individuals died. The relationship between baseline BMI and all-cause mortality was reverse J-shaped. When analyses were restricted to those with normal albumin excretion rate, the relationship was U-shaped. The nadir BMI (BMI with the lowest mortality) was in the normal weight region (24.3 to 24.8 kg/); however, among individuals with diabetic nephropathy, the nadir BMI was in the overweight region (25.9 to 26.1 kg/). Diabetic nephropathy, diabetes-onset age, and sex modified the relationship between BMI and mortality (Pinteraction < 0.05).Normal weight is optimal for individuals with type 1 diabetes to delay mortality, whereas underweight might be an indication of underlying complications. Maintaining normal weight may translate into reduced risk of mortality in type 1 diabetes, particularly for individuals of male sex, later diabetes-onset age, and normal albumin excretion rate.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063197>Impaired Fasting Glucose and Chronic Kidney Disease, Albuminuria, or Worsening Kidney Function: a Secondary Analysis of the SPRINT.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

We categorized participants according to fasting glucose as having impaired fasting glucose (≥100 mg/dL [(≥5.6 mmol/L]) or normoglycemia (<100 mg/dL [(<5.6 mmol/L]). Unadjusted and adjusted proportional hazards models were fit to estimate the association of impaired fasting glucose (versus normoglycemia) with a composite outcome of worsening kidney function (≥30% decrease in eGFR to <60 ml/min/1.73  in participants without baseline CKD; ≥50% decrease in eGFR or need of long-term dialysis/kidney transplantation in participants with CKD) or incident albuminuria (doubling of urinary albumin to creatinine ratio from <10 mg/g to >10 mg/g). These outcomes were also evaluated separately, and according to CKD status at baseline.The mean age was 67.9 ± 9.4 years, 35.5% were female, and 31.4% were black.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the potential of Brachiaria-based constructed wetland for removal of phosphorus and nitrogen in different seasons of a sub-tropical region. The CW cell could efficiently remove phosphate and nitrogen under varying influent concentrations across different seasons. Average removal of total phosphate increased from 55.2% (winter) to 78.5% (spring), 80.7% (autumn), and 85.6% (summer), and maximum removal rate was 384.4 mg/-day during the summer season. The soluble/available phosphate was removed on priority owing to its easy bio-availability. The removal efficiency of Brachiaria increased with increasing influent phosphate concentration (5-20 mg/l), if supplemented with nitrogen maintaining the N:P ratio of 5:1. This highlighted the characteristic of Brachiaria to absorb chemical shocks w.r.t. phosphate. The neutral pH (6.2-8.3) and oxidising conditions in rhizosphere ruled out possibility of binding of phosphate with cations (Ca, Fe, and Al) in sediments. Ambient temperature and sunshine hours regulated evapotranspiration and hence nutrient removal. Simultaneous removal of nitrogen (75.6-84.6%) by Brachiaria indicated that it can serve dual purpose of nutrient removal and fodder-production for livestock, thus serving as a sustainable prototype for rural communities in sub-tropical regions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Ingestion of MILK, BCAA, and BCKA significantly increased early myofibrillar protein synthesis rates (0-2 h) above basal rates (from 0.020 ± 0.002%/h to 0.042 ± 0.004%/h, 0.022 ± 0.002%/h to 0.044 ± 0.004%/h, and 0.023 ± 0.003%/h to 0.044 ± 0.004%/h, respectively; P < 0.001), with no differences between groups (P > 0.05). Myofibrillar protein synthesis rates during the late postprandial phase (2-5 h) remained elevated in the MILK group (0.039 ± 0.004%/h; P < 0.001), but returned to baseline values following BCAA and BCKA ingestion (0.024 ± 0.005%/h and 0.024 ± 0.005%/h, respectively; P > 0.05).Ingestion of 6 g BCAA, 6 g BCKA, and 30 g MILK increases myofibrillar protein synthesis rates during the early postprandial phase (0-2 h) in vivo in healthy older males. The postprandial increase following the ingestion of 6 g BCAA and BCKA is short-lived, with higher myofibrillar protein synthesis rates only being maintained following the ingestion of an equivalent amount of intact milk protein.

We explored multiple datasets for correlation between leukemia, Body Mass Index and molecular features. In a population-based study (n=5.2 million), we correlated Body Mass Index with promyelocytic, other acute myeloid, lymphoid or other leukemias. In cross-sectional studies, we tested body mass index deviation in promyelocytic leukemia trial cohorts from what expected based on national surveys. We interrogated The Cancer Genome Atlas for transcriptional signatures and mutations enriched in promyelocytic leukemia and/or obesity and confirmed correlation between body mass and FLT3 mutations in promyelocytic leukemia cohorts by logistic regression. In the population-based study, Hazard Ratio per 5 kg/ increase was: promyelocytic leukemia 1.44 (95% CI 1.0-2.08); non-promyelocytic acute myeloid leukemias 1.17 (1.10-1.26); lymphoid leukemias 1.04 (1.0-1.09); other 1.10 (1.04-1.15). In cross-sectional studies, body mass deviated significantly from expected (Italy p<0.001, Spain p=0.011, USA p<0.001). Promyelocytic leukemia showed upregulation of polyunsaturated fatty acid  genes. Oddds of FLT3 mutations were higher in obese acute myeloid leukemias (Odds Ratio=2.4, p=0.007), whether promyelocytic or not, a correlation confirmed in the pooled promyelocytic leukemia cohorts (OR 1.22, 1.05-1.43 per 5 kg/). These results strengthen the evidence for obesity as a bona fide risk factor for myeloid leukemias and in particular APL. FLT3 mutations and polyunsaturated fatty acid  may play a previously underappreciated role in obesity-associated leukemogenesis.Copyright © 2019, Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174213>Basal and Postprandial Myofibrillar Protein Synthesis Rates Do Not Differ between Lean and Obese Middle-Aged Men.</a></h2><p>Excess lipid availability has been associated with the development of anabolic resistance.

Attenuation of dysfunctional mitochondria by natural compounds is an emerging strategy for the recovery of abnormal energy  of cancer. To develop a nano-sized curcumin (CUR) in attenuating the energy  of cancer cells, herein, a coral-shaped nano-transporter DNA-FeS-DA nanoparticle was synthesized using double-stranded DNA rich in 'GAG' and 'GC' series as a template and poly-dopamine as an adhesive. CUR was successfully loaded to DNA-FeS-DA with a molar ratio of ssDNA: CUR of 1:16, forming CUR@DNA-FeS-DA. This nano-curcumin can readily enter mitochondrion in MCF-7 cancer cells. The CUR@DNA-FeS-DA nanocomposite displays desirable photothermal effect and stability, while its CUR can be released gradually in the weak acid environment. The expression of both pyruvate kinase  and fatty acid synthase in the MCF-7 cancer cells were noticeably inhibited by CUR@DNA-FeS-DA. Given the controlled release and mitochondria-targeting properties, this CUR@DNA-FeS-DA nanocomposite is a promising new drug entity for intervening the energy  of cancer cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

According to the literature, sibutramine is extensively metabolized into N-desmethyl-sibutramine (M1), N-bisdesmethyl-sibutramine () and monohydroxy derivatives of M1 and . Therefore, it is important to verify new sibutramine metabolites through current analytical methodologies, such as liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Furthermore, the development of a comprehensive approach to investigate sibutramine  can increase the detection window for stimulant misuse and enable advancements in pharmacological studies. This work aimed to develop and evaluate the performance of an LC-HRMS method applying Design of Experiments (DoE) for sibutramine metabolite analysis in human urine. After optimizing the method by DoE, the final chromatographic conditions were based on reversed-phase chromatography using a C18 column with a ramp time of 25 min, a flow rate of 0.17 mL min and a temperature of 50 °C. Mobile phase A consisted of water with 0.1% formic acid and 5 mM ammonium formate, and mobile phase B consisted of methanol with 0.1% formic acid; the initial gradient percent was 15% B, and the injection volume was 5 μL. In addition to the hydroxylated metabolites previously described in human urine, dihydroxy derivatives of M1 and  were observed for the first time.

Targeting these enzymes could attenuate aerobic glycolysis and inhibit tumor proliferation. We investigated whether the PKM2 activator, TEPP-46, and the LDHA inhibitor, FX-11, can be combined to inhibit in vitro and in vivo tumor growth in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. We assessed PKM2 and LDHA expression, enzyme activity, and cell proliferation rate after treatment with TEPP-46, FX-11, or a combination of both. Efficacy was validated in vivo by evaluating tumor growth, PK and LDHA activity in plasma and tumors, and PKM2, LDHA, and Ki-67 expression in tumor tissues following treatment. Dual therapy synergistically inhibited pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and significantly delayed tumor growth in vivo without apparent toxicity. Treatment with TEPP-46 and FX-11 resulted in increased PK and reduced LDHA enzyme activity in plasma and tumor tissues and decreased PKM2 and LDHA expression in tumors, which was reflected by a decrease in tumor volume and proliferation. The targeting of glycolytic enzymes such as PKM2 and LDHA represents a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31392878>Microglia M1/ polarization contributes to electromagnetic pulse-induced brain injury.</a></h2><p>The development of electronic technology has attracted attention on the biological effects of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and electromagnetic pulse (EMP). It remains controversial whether EMP irradiation is neurotoxic or beneficial for recovery from injuryies such as cerebral ischemia. Microglia is innate immune cells in the brain, exhibiting either neurotoxicity or neuroprotection effect during various central nervous system diseases, depending on their activation into a classical (M1) or alternative () phenotype, respectively. The Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) pathway is important for microglia activation. In this study, we investigated the effect of EMP on neuronal apoptosis and microglia polarization in vivo and in vitro, using an EMP of 400 kV/m and 1 hertz for 200 pulses. Short EMP irradiation (≤24 h) resulted in microglial conversion from the resting to the M1-type state, activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NFκB pathway, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, as well as neuronal apoptosis induction. In contrast, long EMP irradiation (3 days) resulted in microglial activation into the -type, decreased apoptosis and inflammatory mediator production, and increased levels of the neuroprotective effectors IL-10, transforming growth factor beta, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. EMP induces both neuronal damage and neuronal recovery by influencing the switch of M1/ polarization and the TLR4/MyD88/NFκB pathway.Copyright 2019 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31177125>RAW 264.7 Macrophage Polarization by Pancreatic Cancer Cells - A Model for Studying Tumour-promoting Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) are highjacked -polarized macrophages that especially promote pancreatic cancer growth.

Classically activated (M1) macrophages are characterized by strong antimicrobicidal properties, whereas alternatively activated () macrophages are involved in wound healing. Severe inflammation can induce postoperative complications during the perioperative period. Invasive surgical procedures induce polarization to M1 macrophages and associated complications. As perioperative management, it is an important strategy to regulate polarization and functions of macrophages during inflammatory processes. Although propofol has been found to exhibit anti-inflammatory activities in monocytes and macrophages, it is unclear whether propofol regulates the functions of M1 and  macrophages during inflammatory processes. This study therefore investigated the effects of propofol on human macrophage polarization. During M1 polarization, propofol suppressed the production of IL-6 and IL-1 but did not affect TNF- production. In contrast, propofol did not affect the gene expression of  markers, such as IL-10, TGF-, and CD206, during  polarization. Propofol was similar to the GABA agonist muscimol in inducing nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and inhibiting IL-6 and IL-1, but not TNF-, production. Knockdown of Nrf2 using siRNA significantly reduced the effect of propofol on IL-6 and IL-1 production. These results suggest that propofol prevents inflammatory responses during polarization of human M1 macrophages by suppressing the expression of IL-6 and IL-1 through the GABA receptor and the Nrf2-mediated signal transduction pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501520>O-GlcNAcase targets pyruvate kinase  to regulate tumor growth.</a></h2><p>Cancer cells are known to adopt aerobic glycolysis in order to fuel tumor growth, but the molecular basis of this  shift remains largely undefined. O-GlcNAcase (OGA) is an enzyme harboring O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) hydrolase and cryptic lysine acetyltransferase activities. Here, we report that OGA is upregulated in a wide range of human cancers and drives aerobic glycolysis and tumor growth by inhibiting pyruvate kinase  (PKM2). PKM2 is dynamically O-GlcNAcylated in response to changes in glucose availability. Under high glucose conditions, PKM2 is a target of OGA-associated acetyltransferase activity, which facilitates O-GlcNAcylation of PKM2 by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). O-GlcNAcylation inhibits PKM2 catalytic activity and thereby promotes aerobic glycolysis and tumor growth. These studies define a causative role for OGA in tumor progression and reveal PKM2 O-GlcNAcylation as a  rheostat that mediates exquisite control of aerobic glycolysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31185414>Discovery of novel benzofuran-based compounds with neuroprotective and immunomodulatory properties for Alzheimer's disease treatment.</a></h2><p>To address the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a multi-target-directed ligand approach was herein developed.

Angiogenesis is initiated by the detachment of pericytes (PCs) from vessels in AT. This process is necessary for the development of AT in obesity. The detachment is caused by excessive platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) derived from M1-macrophages (Mφ) infiltrating obese AT. On the other hand, AT of tamoxifen-induced systemic PDGF receptor-β knockout mice showed decreased detachment of PCs from vessels in obesity, thereby attenuating hypertrophy of AT mediated by neoangiogenesis, resulting in protection from the development of chronic AT inflammation and systemic insulin resistance. The selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) inhibitor eplerenone (Ep) suppresses chronic inflammation in fat and the liver, improves glucose and lipid , and inhibits body weight and fat mass gain in mice fed a high-fat diet. As a novel mechanism, Ep increases energy expenditure and suppresses fat accumulation, thereby controlling the polarity of visceral AT Mφ from inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory  dominant. In addition, Ep directly inhibits the activation of signals 1 and 2 of NLRP3-inflammasomes in Mφ, which is an inflammatory mechanism closely involved in the development of NASH. Thus, we propose novel therapeutic approaches to NASH. Inhibition of PDGF receptor-β signaling prevents AT hypertrophy by regulating AT angiogenesis, and MR inhibitors directly suppress chronic inflammation in the AT and liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31153132>Simultaneous determination of imrecoxib and its two active metabolites in plasma of hepatic impairment patients by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Imrecoxib is a specific inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2.

The broad spectrum of macrophage functions depends on both heterogeneity and plasticity of these cells, which are highly specialized in sensing the microenvironment and modify their properties accordingly. Although it is clear that macrophage phenotypes are difficult to categorize and should be seen as plastic and adaptable, they can be simplified into two extremes: a pro-inflammatory (M1) and an anti-inflammatory/pro-resolving () profile. Based on this definition, M1 macrophages are able to start and sustain inflammatory responses, secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, activating endothelial cells, and inducing the recruitment of other immune cells into the inflamed tissue; on the other hand,  macrophages promote the resolution of inflammation, phagocytose apoptotic cells, drive collagen deposition, coordinate tissue integrity, and release anti-inflammatory mediators. Dramatic switches in cell  accompany these phenotypic and functional changes of macrophages. In particular, M1 macrophages rely mainly on glycolysis and present two breaks on the TCA cycle that result in accumulation of itaconate (a microbicide compound) and succinate. Excess of succinate leads to Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1α (HIF1α) stabilization that, in turn, activates the transcription of glycolytic genes, thus sustaining the glycolytic  of M1 macrophages. On the contrary,  cells are more dependent on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), their TCA cycle is intact and provides the substrates for the complexes of the electron transport chain (ETC). Moreover, pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages are characterized by specific  that regulate the  of lipids and amino acids and affect their responses. All these  adaptations are functional to support macrophage activities as well as to sustain their polarization in specific contexts.

The intrapersonal mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation of eGFR for 238 patients were obtained in the 3 years prior to the study.The patients who had lower eGFR and higher UACR were older, with longer diabetes duration, a greater percentage of retinopathy and PN, and higher CAS. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that diabetes duration and eGFR were independently associated with CAS, and a cut-off value of eGFR in the presence of PN was 65.3 mL/min/1.73 .We observed a close relationship between the severity of kidney and peripheral nerve function in patients with diabetes. If a patient's eGFR value is below 65.3 mL/min/1.73  or the UACR value is above 98.6 mg/dL, caution is needed with the presence of PN even in diabetic patients who are asymptomatic.© The Author(s) 2019.

Ultrasonography of subcutaneous fat was performed for LH diagnostics in these diabetic patients. Than clinical significance of LH without visual and palpable changes was estimated. HbA1c level, fasting and postprandial glucose, episodes of hypoglycemia, body mass index (BMI) and scheme of insulinotherapy were evaluated at the moment of LH, after 3 and 6 months in all patients.After changing injection sites, good results were demonstrated by measuring glucose and HbA1c level. Thus fasting glucose decreased from 9.03±1.98 mmol/l to 7.11±0.95 mmol/l (p=0.023). Postprandial glucose reduced from 10.27±2.72 mmol/l to 9.34±1.21 mmol/l (p=0.011). HbA1c level reduced from 9.27±1.75% to 7.43±1.02% (p=0.002). Also BMI decreased from 33.75±3.49 kg/ to 30.5±2.96 kg/ (p=0.018).LH without visual and palpable changes could worsen compensation of glycemic control and leads to hypoglycemia and chronic Somogyi rebound. So, LH without visual and palpable is as important and clinically significant as classic LH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579465>The association of food quality score and cardiovascular diseases risk factors among women: A cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p> Limited studies are available regarding the relationship between Food Quality Score (FQS) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Thus, this study was aimed to investigate the association of FQS with CVD risk factors in women.  This cross-sectional study was carried out among 368 women aged 20-50 years who randomly selected from health centers across Tehran, Iran. Dietary intake was collected using a reliable and validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The FQS includes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, yogurt, nuts and legumes, coffee, refined grains, desserts and ice cream, sugar-sweetened beverages, red meats, fried food consumed outside the home, processed meats, potato and potato chips. Standard methods were used to assess blood pressure, biochemical and anthropometric measures. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the association between FQS and CVD risk factors.  Participant mean age and body mass index (BMI) were 30.7 ± 6.9 years and 24.3 ± 4.0 kg/, respectively. After taking potential confounders into account, FQS had no significant association with risk of overweight and obesity [Odds ratio (OR): 1.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.68, 1.8;  = 0.683], diabetes (OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.22, 1.74;  = 0.374),  syndrome (OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.10, 1.32;  = 0.127), hypercholesterolemia (OR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.29, 1.01; = 0.051), or hypertriglyceridemia (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 0.71, 3.70;  = 0.244).  The results showed that FQS was not significantly associated with CVD risk factors among women.

A prospective SPECT/CT study.</a></h2><p>Altered alignment and biomechanics are thought to contribute to the progression of osteoarthritis (OA) in the native compartments after medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). The aim of this study was to evaluate the bone activity and remodelling in the lateral tibiofemoral and patellofemoral compartment after medial mobile-bearing UKA.In total, 24 patients (nine female, 15 male) with 25 medial Oxford UKAs (13 left, 12 right) were prospectively followed with sequential 99mTc-hydroxymethane diphosphonate single photon emission CT (SPECT)/CT preoperatively and at one and two years postoperatively, along with standard radiographs and clinical outcome scores. The mean patient age was 62 years (40 to 78) and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 29.7 kg/ (23.6 to 42.2). Mean osteoblastic activity was evaluated using a tracer localization scheme with volumes of interest (VOIs). Normalized mean tracer values were calculated as the ratio between the mean tracer activity in a VOI and background activity in the femoral diaphysis.Significant reduction of normalized tracer activity was observed one year postoperatively in tibial and femoral VOIs adjacent to the joint line in the lateral compartment. Patellar VOIs and remaining femoral VOIs demonstrated a significant, diminished normalized tracer activity at final follow-up.The osteoblastic bone activity in the native compartments decreased significantly after treatment of medial end-stage OA with a UKA, implying reduced stress to the subchondral bone in the retained compartments after a UKA.

Methods An animal model of allergic asthma induced by Dermatophagoides farinae allergen was established in mice. After the last challenge lasting 24 hours, the middle lobe of mouse lung was taken and HE staining was used to observe its inflammatory changes. The levels of miR-155-5p in the lung and spleen as well as spleen CD4 T cells were detected by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). The proportions of CD4IFN-γ Th1 cells and CD4IL-4 Th2 cells in the spleen of asthmatic mice were detected by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression levels of  macrophage marker genes arginase 1 (Arg1), chitinase-like molecule 3 (YM1/Chi3l3) and resistance-like α (Retnlα/FIZZ1) in the lung were examined by qRT-PCR. Spleen-derived CD4 T cells from the asthmatic mice were co-cultured in vitro with BMDMs for 48 hours, and then the mRNA expression levels of Arg1, YM1, and FIZZ1 in the BMDMs were detected by qRT-PCR. The spleen CD4 T cells of the asthmatic mice were transfected with miR-155-5p inhibitor or the negative control, and then co-cultured with BMDM for 48 hours. The qRT-PCR was used to further determine the expression levels of Arg1, YM1, FIZZ1 in BMDMs. Results Compared with the control group, the levels of miR-155-5p in the lung, spleen and spleen CD4 T cells of asthmatic mice increased, and the proportion of Th2 cells in asthmatic mouse spleen also increased. The expression levels of the  macrophage marker genes Arg1, YM1 and FIZZ1 were up-regulated in the lung of asthmatic mice compared to the control group. After co-culture of spleen CD4 T cells from asthmatic mice with BMDMs in vitro, the mRNA expression levels of  marker genes Arg1, YM1 and FIZZ1 of BMDMs were up-regulated. While transfected with miR-155-5p-inhibitor, the spleen CD4 T cells of asthmatic mice did not significantly affect the  marker gene expression of the BMDMs. Conclusion The spleen-derived CD4 T cells of asthmatic mice can promote the polarization of co-cultured macrophages towards  phenotype in vitro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433975>Suppression of p16 Induces mTORC1-Mediated Nucleotide  Reprogramming.</a></h2><p>Reprogrammed  and cell cycle dysregulation are two cancer hallmarks. p16 is a cell cycle inhibitor and tumor suppressor that is upregulated during oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Loss of p16 allows for uninhibited cell cycle progression, bypass of OIS, and tumorigenesis. Whether p16 loss affects pro-tumorigenic  is unclear. We report that suppression of p16 plays a central role in reprogramming  by increasing nucleotide synthesis. This occurs by activation of mTORC1 signaling, which directly mediates increased translation of the mRNA encoding ribose-5-phosphate isomerase A (RPIA), a pentose phosphate pathway enzyme. p16 loss correlates with activation of the mTORC1-RPIA axis in multiple cancer types. Suppression of RPIA inhibits proliferation only in p16-low cells by inducing senescence both in vitro and in vivo. These data reveal the molecular basis whereby p16 loss modulates pro-tumorigenic  through mTORC1-mediated upregulation of nucleotide synthesis and reveals a  vulnerability of p16-null cancer cells.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

We aimed to assess the changes in serum Mg concentrations at 12-month follow-up in patients, with and without T2DM, who underwent one anastomosis gastric bypass surgery. Overall, 50 patients (80% female, age 42.2 (12.5) years) with morbid obesity (mean baseline BMI 43.8 (4.3) kg/) were included in the analysis. Half of the included patients had T2DM diagnosed at baseline, and these patients showed lower serum Mg concentration (0.78 (0.07)) vs. 0.83 (0.05) mmol/L;  = 0.006), higher blood glucose levels (129.9 (41.3) vs. 87.6 (8.1) mg/dL;  < 0.001) as well as HbA1c concentrations (6.7 (1.4) vs. 5.3 (0.5)%;  < 0.001). During follow-up, BMI and glucose levels showed a decrease; however, serum Mg levels remained stable. At baseline 42% of patients were found to be Mg deficient, which was reduced to 33% at six months and to 30% at 12 months follow-up. Moreover, patients with T2DM had an odds ratio of 9.5 (95% CI = 3.0-29.7;  < 0.001) for magnesium deficiency when compared to patients without T2DM.

We investigated the differences of various biomarkers among individuals with or without Mets in a gender-specific manner. The gender-specific associations between E-selectin and MetS were further evaluated.A total of 205 patients were recruited from the outpatient clinics of Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. Inclusion criteria were age between 20-75 years and BMI < 35 kg/. Demographic, anthropometric and MetS index data were compared between genders. Markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction were compared between individuals with or without MetS by gender.Age-adjusted E-selectin values showed significant positive correlations with BMI, waist-hip ratio, fasting plasma glucose, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, TNF-α, hsCRP and ICAM-1, and inverse correlation with HDL cholesterol. E-selectin levels were positively correlated with numbers of MetS components in females (P < 0.001) but not in males (P = 0.125).Increased E-selectin levels are significantly associated with increased MetS risk in females, but not in males.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547261>Transcriptomic Responses in the Livers and Jejunal Mucosa of Pigs under Different Feeding Frequencies.</a></h2><p>Feeding frequency in one day is thought to be associated with nutrient  and the physical development of the body in both experimental animals and humans. The present study was conducted to investigate transcriptomic responses in the liver and jejunal mucosa of pigs to evaluate the effects of different feeding frequencies on the body's . Twelve Duroc × Landrance × Yorkshire growing pigs with an average initial weight (IW) of 14.86 ± 0.20 kg were randomly assigned to two groups: feeding one time per day (M1) and feeding two times per day (); each group consisted of six replicates (pens), with one pig per pen. During the one-month experimental period, pigs in the M1 group were fed on an ad libitum basis at 8:00 am; and the  group was fed half of the standard feeding requirement at 8:00 am and adequate feed at 16:00 pm. The results showed that average daily feed intake, average daily gain, feed:gain, and the organ indices were not significantly different between the two groups ( > 0.05). The total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations in the serum, and the TG concentration in the liver in the  groups were significant lower than those in the M1 group, while the T-CHO concentration in the liver were significant higher in the  group ( < 0.05). Jejunal mucosa transcriptomic analysis showed the gene of ,  and  were upregulated in the  group, indicating that fat digestion was enhanced in the small intestine, whereas  ( and ) were downregulated, indicating that body fat was not deposited.  and  were upregulated in the  group, indicating that two times feeding daily could promote the oxidative decomposition of fatty acids. In conclusion, under the conditions in this study, the feeding frequency had no significant effect on the growth performance of pigs, but affected the body's lipid , and the increase of feeding frequency promoted the fat digestion in the small intestine and the oxidative decomposition of fatty acids in the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31378209>Effects of stocking density during the dry period on dairy cow physiology,  and behaviour.</a></h2><p>The effects of high stocking density during the dry period on dairy cow physiology, behaviour and welfare were investigated. Holstein Friesian cows (n = 48, calving over a seven month period) were dried-off 60 ± 4 d before their expected calving date, and allocated to either high (H) or low (L) stocking density groups. Cows were housed in cubicles from dry-off to 21 d before calving and then moved to straw yards until calving. In cubicle pens, H and L cows had 0.5 vs. 1.0 feed yokes/cow and 1.0 vs. 1.5 cubicles/cow, respectively, and in straw yards, 0.3 m vs. 0.6 m linear feed-face space and 6 m2vs. 12  lying space, respectively. Video observations of feeding behaviour during the 3 h after feed delivery (3 d/week) and agonistic interactions at the feed-face during peak feeding (2 d/week) were made. Daily lying proportion was measured using an accelerometer device throughout the dry period. Concentrations of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGCM) at dry-off, d7 and d35 after dry-off and d21 and d7 before calving and the change in energy metabolites (glucose, NEFA, BHB) from dry-off to d7 before calving were measured. H cows were less likely to start feeding within 5 min of feed delivery and spent less time feeding compared to L cows, but they engaged in displacements more frequently and spent more time standing in the feed alley. Irrespective of the treatment groups, FGCM concentrations significantly increased from dry-off to d7 after dry-off and remained higher during the dry period. Stocking density did not affect daily lying proportion, energy metabolites during the dry period and milk yield during subsequent lactation. This study found that whilst high stocking density during the dry period increased competition at the feed-face and altered feeding behaviour, it did not affect stress responses, energy  or subsequent milk yield.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108030>[Bilateral impact of cardiorenal relationships in the nephrotic syndrome.]</a></h2><p>To study and analyze the cardiorenal relationships in nephrotic syndrome, taking into account sex differences. A total of 272 patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS) aged 16 to 65 years were examined. All patients underwent general clinical examination, electro-and echocardiography, assessment of peripheral and biochemical blood counts. NS was determined with daily proteinuria of more than 3.5 g/1.73  per day, hypoalbuminemia (albumin less than 30 g/l) and hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol more than 5.1 mmol/l). The duration of the National Assembly ranged from 3 months or more. Depending on the gender, the total sample (n=272) was divided into two subgroups: the 1st subgroup - patients with female NS (n=88), the 2nd subgroup - males with NS (n=184). The mean systolic, diastolic, pulse and mean arterial pressure (BP) were significantly higher in male NS patients (p<0.05). Supraventricular and ventricular ectopic activity was significantly more common in males. In the subgroup of women with NA, sinus tachycardia was significantly more frequently detected, a slowing down of the impulse conduction along the bundle of His, a violation of the processes of repolarization of the LV (p<0.05). The final systolic and diastolic sizes of the left ventricle (LV), the thickness of the interventricular septum and the posterior wall of the left ventricle, the diameter of the aorta, the longitudinal size of the left atrium and the right ventricle were significantly larger in the group of males with NA. Significantly lower concentrations of hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte counts were observed in the subgroup of females with NS compared with men (p<0.05). In the cohort of men with HC, there was a significant decrease in the content of total serum protein (44.8±11.0 g/l versus 49.2±11.2 g/l; p=0.003) as compared with females. In the male subgroup of HC, serum creatinine concentration [97 (81;143) mmol/l versus 86 (68;123) mmol/l; p=0.005] and the degree of daily protein excretion [6,490 (4,865;9,661) g versus 5,585 (4,168;7,625) g; p=0.034] with urine were significantly higher compared with the female subgroup (Table 2). At the same time, in the cohort of men with HC, there was a significant decrease in the calculated GFR [62.3 (46.2; 114.9) ml/min versus 87.0 (67.7;127.5) ml/min; p=0.002]. In case of NS in females, factors of deterioration of cardiorenal interrelations are anemia, sinus tachycardia, slowing down of impulse conduction along the bundle of His. Whereas in the NA subgroup of men, negative factors of cardiorenal interrelations are hypoproteinemia, increased systolic, diastolic, pulse and mean blood pressure, creatinine concentration and daily proteinuria, which was accompanied by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and an increase in the linear dimensions of the heart.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31012108>Long noncoding RNA MALAT1 mediates stem cell-like properties in human colorectal cancer cells by regulating miR-20b-5p/Oct4 axis.</a></h2><p>Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are crucial components of the tumor microenvironment that take part in tumor initiation, progression, recurrence, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy. This study explores the mechanisms through which CSCs maintain their stemness, especially in tumors of colorectal cancer (CRC), which thus far remain uncertain. Our findings indicated that the expression of miR-20b-5p is negatively correlated with that of metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript-1 (MALAT1, r = -0.928, p = 0.023) and Oct4 (r = -0.894, p = 0.041) in CRC cells. We hypothesized that there may be some targeted regulatory relationships among MALAT1, miR-20b-5p, and Oct4. We proceeded to show that both si-MALAT1 and miR-20b-5p-mimic attenuated microsphere formation and self-renewal capacity, decreased the proportion of CSCs, and downregulated the expression of proteins associated with tumor cell stemness maintenance (Oct4, Nanog, sex-determining region Y-box 2, and Notch1) and cellular  (glucose transporter 1, lactate dehydrogenase B, hexokinase 2, and pyruvate kinase isozyme ) in HCT-116 cells in vitro. In addition, a xenograft model based on Balb/c mice demonstrated that the administration of either si-MALAT1 or miR-20b-5p-mimic suppressed the tumorigenicity of HCT-116 cells in vivo. The underlying mechanisms may involve the targeting of the tumor cell stemness maintenance-related factor Oct4 by miR-20b-5p. For the first time, we present the possible underlying effects of MALAT1 in influencing the stem cell-like properties of CRC cells. We propose that microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs have vital functions in mediating tumor stemness, which remain to be fully elucidated.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336576>Identification of Catalposide Metabolites in Human Liver and Intestinal Preparations and Characterization of the Relevant Sulfotransferase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, and Carboxylesterase Enzymes.</a></h2><p>Catalposide, an active component of  species such as  and , exhibits anti-inflammatory, antinociceptic, anti-oxidant, hepatoprotective, and cytostatic activities.

The aim was to assess gender differences of structure functional changes and LV myocardial remodeling in patients with AVC depending on the type of valve lesion. 293 patients (131 men) with revealed AVC by transthoracic echocardioscopy without aortic stenosis and 76 patients (50 men) without AVC were examined. Men had normal geometry of LV more often than women (15.7% vs. 4.4 % in isolated AVC and 11.9% vs. 2.8 % in combined lesion of aortic valve (AV) and mitral valves ring (MVR), р<0.052), and eccentric hypertrophy was registered more often in man with combined AV and MVR lesion (38.1% vs. 15.5 % in women with combined AV and MVR lesion and vs. 20.2 % in men with isolated AVC, р<0.029). LV systolic function was worse in men with combined valves lesion (ejection fraction was 54.0 (48.0; 65.0) vs. 66.0 (60.0; 71.0) % in women with combined valves lesion and vs. 63.0 (55.0; 70.0) % in men with isolated AVC, р<0.022). Men with combined valves lesion also had a larger right ventricle (RV) size (RV index was 1.3 (1.2; 1.5) vs. 1.2 (1.1; 1.4) cm/ in women with combined valves lesion and vs. 1.2 (1.1; 1.4) cm/ in men with isolated AVC, р<0.036) and had tricuspid regurgitation more often (76.2% vs. 56.3 % in women with combined valves lesion and vs. 58.4 % in men with isolated AVC, р<0.029).

Selective targeting of TAMs holds great potential to ameliorate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhance the efficacy of antitumor therapy. Various liposomes have been developed to target TAMs via cell-specific surface receptors either to deplete or re-educate TAMs. Since immuno-stimulation often initiates with the interaction of nanocarriers with the innate immunity cells such as macrophages, the intrinsic impact of drug-free liposomes on macrophage activation and polarization via cell interaction is one of the most critical issues in nanomedicine for promoting effective immunotherapy.  In this study, conventional bare liposomes, PEGylated liposomes, and mannosylated liposomes were developed and the cytotoxicity, cellular internalization, immunostimulatory activity, targeting efficiency, antitumor efficacy, and mechanism were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.  All liposomes displayed an ideal particle size, good biocompatibility, and controlled release behavior. Mannosylated liposomes exhibited superior in vitro cellular internalization and tumor spheroid penetration with the aid of the mannose receptor-mediated TAMs-targeting effects. In particular, mannosylated liposomes promoted the polarization of both M0 and  to the M1 phenotype by enhancing the expression ratio of CD86/CD206 in vitro. Of note, mannosylated liposomes could inhibit G422 glioma tumor growth, which may be attributed to the polarization of TAMs, as evidenced by the reduction in expression level of the TAMs surface marker.  These results indicate the potential value of mannosylated liposomes in the design of a rational delivery system to enhance the antitumor immune efficacy of immunomodulators by inducing a shift from the  to the M1 phenotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31180669>Long-Time Instead of Short-Time Exposure in Vitro and Administration in Vivo of Ochratoxin A Is Consistent in Immunosuppression.</a></h2><p>Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus and Penicillium, contaminating in a wide variety of foods and feeds. Mycotoxins, including OTA, could cause immunosuppression in almost all previous studies in vivo. However, the vast majority of results in vitro showed that mycotoxins caused immunostimulation. Why the results of studies in vitro are contrary to studies in vivo is unknown. Our study aims to explore the underlying reason and mechanism of the paradoxical effect. In this study, porcine alveolar macrophage cell line 3D4/21 was chosen as an in vitro model and treated with 1.0 μg/mL OTA for different times. Some indexes, such as expression of inflammatory cytokines, migration, phagocytosis, macrophage polarization, autophagy-related proteins, and Akt1 phosphorylation, were detected. The results showed that pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, migration, and phagocytosis were increased, with macrophage polarization to the M1 phenotype at 24 h of OTA exposure. Surprisedly, anti-inflammatory cytokine expression was increased, cell phagocytosis and migration were decreased, and macrophage polarization was switched from M1 to  at 72 h of OTA exposure. Furthermore, we found that long-time exposure of OTA also suppressed autophagy, and the autophagy activator blocked the OTA-induced immunosuppression. Phosphorylation of Akt1 plays a positive role in autophagy inhibition. In conclusion, long-time instead of short-time exposure of OTA in vitro induced immunosuppression. The immunosuppression mechanism of OTA in vitro involved inhibition of autophagy through upregulating p-Akt1. Our results provide new insight into research on the mechanism of mycotoxin-induced immunosuppression in vitro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31426846>Decitabine assists umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells in improving glucose homeostasis by modulating macrophage polarization in type 2 diabetic mice.</a></h2><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a promising therapy for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Mechanistic researches demonstrate that the anti-diabetic effect of MSCs is partially mediated by eliciting macrophages into an anti-inflammatory phenotype thus alleviating insulin resistance. However, single MSC infusion is insufficient to ameliorate sustained hyperglycemia or normalize blood glucose levels. In this study, we used decitabine (DAC), which is involved in the regulation of macrophage polarization, to test whether MSCs combined with decitabine can prolong and enhance the anti-diabetic effect in T2D mice.High-fat diet (HFD) and streptozocin (STZ) were given to induce T2D mouse model. Successfully induced T2D mice were randomly divided into four groups: T2D group, MSC group, DAC group, and MSC + DAC group. Blood glucose was monitored, and glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were evaluated during the entire analysis period. Epididymal fat was extracted for analysis of macrophage phenotype and inflammation in adipose tissue. In vitro, we examined the effect of MSC + DAC on macrophage polarization in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and explore the possible mechanism.MSC infusion effectively improved insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis in T2D mice within 1 week, whereas combination therapy of MSCs + DAC extended the anti-diabetic effects of MSCs from 1 to 4 weeks (the end of the observation). Correspondingly, more  macrophages in adipose tissue were observed in the combination therapy group over the entire study period. In vitro, compared with the MSC group, MSCs combined with decitabine more effectively polarized M1 macrophages to  macrophages. Further analysis showed that the effect of MSC + DAC on macrophage polarization was largely abrogated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) antagonist GW9662.Our data suggest that MSCs combined with decitabine can more effectively alleviate insulin resistance and prolong and enhance the anti-diabetic effect of MSCs in T2D mice in part by prompting  polarization in a PPARγ-dependent manner. Thus, decitabine may be an applicable addition to MSCs for diabetes therapy. UC-MSCs combined with decitabine activate the IL4R/STAT6/STAT3/PPARγ axis to further promote  macrophage polarization in adipose tissue, reduce inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity, and lead to better glucose  and long-term hypoglycemic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075757>Identifying a disease-specific renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system fingerprint in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency.</a></h2><p>In patients suffering from primary adrenal insufficiency (AI) mortality is increased despite adequate glucocorticoid (GC) and mineralocorticoid (MC) replacement therapy, mainly due to an increased cardiovascular risk. Since activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in the modulation of cardiovascular risk factors, we performed in-depth characterization of the RAAS activity.Eight patients with primary AI (female = 5; age: 56 ± 21 years; BMI: 22.8 ± 2 kg/; mean blood pressure: 140/83 mmHg; hydrocortisone dose: 21.9 ± 5 mg/day; fludrocortisone dose: 0.061 ± 0.03 mg/day) and eight matched healthy volunteers (female = 5; age: 52 ± 21 years; BMI: 25.2 ± 4 kg/; mean blood pressure:135/84 mmHg) were included in a cross-sectional case-control study. Angiotensin metabolite profiles (RAS-fingerprints) were performed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.In patients suffering from primary AI, RAAS activity was highly increased with elevated concentrations of renin concentration (P = 0.027), angiotensin (Ang) I (P = 0.022), Ang II (P = 0.032), Ang 1-7 and Ang 1-5. As expected, aldosterone was not detectable in the majority of AI patients, resulting in a profoundly suppressed aldosterone-to-AngII ratio (AA2 ratio, P = 0.003) compared to controls. PRA-S, the angiotensin-based marker for plasma renin activity, correlated with plasma renin activity (r = 0.983; P < 0.01) and plasma renin concentration (r = 0.985; P < 0.001) and was significantly increased in AI patients.AI is associated with a unique RAAS profile characterized by the absence of aldosterone despite strongly elevated levels of angiotensin metabolites, including the potent vasoconstrictor AngII. Despite state-of-the-art hormone replacement therapy, the RAAS remains hyperactivated. The contribution of Ang II in cardiovascular diseases in AI patients as well as a potential role for providing useful complementary information at diagnosis and follow up of AI should be investigated in future trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31215741>Interaction of transforming growth factor-β-Smads/microRNA-362-3p/CD82 mediated by  macrophages promotes the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.</a></h2><p>Abnormal tumor microenvironment and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are important features of tumor metastasis. However, it remains unknown how signals can form complicated  to regulate the sustainability of the EMT process. The aim of our study is to explore the possible interaction between tumor-associated macrophages and tumor cells in the EMT process mediated by microRNA (miR)-362-3p. In this study, we found that by releasing TGF-β,  macrophages mediate binding of Smad2/3 to miR-362-3p promoter, leading to overexpression of miR-362-3p. MicroRNA-362-3p maintains EMT by regulating CD82, one of the most important members of the family of tetraspanins. Our finding suggests that miR-362-3p can serve as a core factor mediating cross-talk between the TGF-β pathway in tumor-associated macrophages and tetraspanins in tumor cells, and thus facilitates the EMT process.© 2019 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to characterize the metabolites of AdipoRon in rat and human liver microsomes using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography combined with Q-Exactive Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-MS) together with data processing techniques including extracted ion chromatograms and a mass defect filter. AdipoRon (10 μm) was incubated with liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH and this resulted in a total of 11 metabolites being detected. The identities of these metabolites were characterized by comparing their accurate masses and fragment ions as well as their retention times with those of AdipoRon using MetWorks software. Metabolites M1-M3, M6, and M8-M11 were identified for the first time. Metabolite M4, the major metabolite both in rat and human liver microsomes, was further confirmed using the reference standard. Our results revealed that the   of AdipoRon in liver microsomes were N-dealkylation (), hydroxylation (M, M5-M9), carbonyl reduction (M4) and the formation of amide (M10 and M11). Our results provide valuable information about the in vitro  of AdipoRon, which would be helpful for us to understand the mechanism of the elimination of AdipoRon and, in turn, its effectiveness and toxicity.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31186346>Cardiolipin-induced activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase links mitochondrial lipid biosynthesis to TCA cycle function.</a></h2><p>Cardiolipin (CL) is the signature phospholipid of mitochondrial membranes. Although it has long been known that CL plays an important role in mitochondrial bioenergetics, recent evidence in the yeast model indicates that CL is also essential for intermediary . To gain insight into the function of CL in energy  in mammalian cells, here we analyzed the  flux of [U-C]glucose in a mouse C2C12 myoblast cell line, TAZ-KO, which is CL-deficient because of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of the CL-remodeling enzyme tafazzin (TAZ). TAZ-KO cells exhibited decreased flux of [U-C]glucose to [C]acetyl-CoA and  and M4 isotopomers of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates. The activity of pyruvate carboxylase, the predominant enzyme for anaplerotic replenishing of the TCA cycle, was elevated in TAZ-KO cells, which also exhibited increased sensitivity to the pyruvate carboxylase inhibitor phenylacetate. We attributed a decreased carbon flux from glucose to acetyl-CoA in the TAZ-KO cells to a ∼50% decrease in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, which was observed in both TAZ-KO cells and cardiac tissue from TAZ-KO mice. Protein-lipid overlay experiments revealed that PDH binds to CL, and supplementing digitonin-solubilized TAZ-KO mitochondria with CL restored PDH activity to WT levels. Mitochondria from TAZ-KO cells exhibited an increase in phosphorylated PDH, levels of which were reduced in the presence of supplemented CL. These findings indicate that CL is required for optimal PDH activation, generation of acetyl-CoA, and TCA cycle function, findings that link the key mitochondrial lipid CL to TCA cycle function and energy .© 2019 Li et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654067>The molecular mechanisms of LncRNA-correlated PKM2 in cancer .</a></h2><p>Reprogrammed  is an important hallmark of cancer cells. Pyruvate kinase is one of the major rate-limiting enzymes in glucose . The  isoform of Pyruvate kinase (PKM2), this is, PKM2, is considered to be an important marker of  reprogramming and one of key enzymes. Recently, through the continuous development of genome-wide analysis and functional studies, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) play vital regulatory roles in cancer progression by acting as either potential oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Furthermore, several studies have shown that up-regulation of PKM2 in cancer tissues is associated with LncRNAs expression and patient survival. Thus, scientists have begun to unveil the mechanism of LncRNA-associated PKM2 in cancer  progression. Based on these novel findings, in this mini-review, we summarize the detailed molecular mechanisms of LncRNA related to PKM2 in cancer . We expect that this work will promote a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of PKM2, and provide a profound potential for targeting PKM2 to treat tumors.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149709>Leucine Supplementation Does Not Alter Insulin Sensitivity in Prefrail and Frail Older Women following a Resistance Training Protocol.</a></h2><p>Frailty is a clinical condition associated with loss of muscle mass and strength (sarcopenia). Although sarcopenia has multifactorial causes, it might be partly attributed to a blunted response to anabolic stimuli. Leucine acutely increases muscle protein synthesis, and resistance training (RT) is the strongest stimuli to counteract sarcopenia and was recently shown to improve insulin sensitivity (IS) in frail older women. Discrepancies exist regarding whether chronic supplementation of leucine in conjunction with RT can improve muscle mass and IS.The aim of this double-blinded placebo-controlled study was to determine the effects of leucine supplementation and RT on IS in prefrail and frail older women.Using the Fried criteria, 19 nondiabetic prefrail (1-2 criteria) and frail (≥3 criteria) older women (77.5 ± 1.3 y; body mass index (kg/): 25.1 ± 0.9) underwent a 3-mo intervention of RT 3 times/wk with protein-optimized diet of 1.2 g·kg-1·d-1 and 7.5 g·d-1 of l-leucine supplementation compared with placebo l-alanine. Pre-/postintervention primary outcomes were fasting plasma glucose, serum insulin, and 4-h responses to a standard meal of complete liquid formula. Secondary outcomes of resting energy expenditure using indirect calorimetry and body composition using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were obtained. Paired t tests analyzed pooled data, and 2-factor repeated-measures ANOVA determined supplementation, training, and interaction effects.No significant time, group, or interaction effects were observed for postprandial areas under the curve of serum insulin or plasma glucose or for resting energy expenditure in l-leucine compared with l-alanine. Total lean body mass increased and percentage body fat decreased significantly for both groups postintervention (0.76 ± 0.13 and -0.92 ± 0.33 kg, respectively; time effect: P < 0.01).IS was not affected by RT and leucine supplementation in nondiabetic prefrail and frail older women.

In our previous study, significant evidence was provided for the contribution of oral Mg supplement that could improve insulin sensitivity and body weight in animal trials. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of an herbal supplement containing 300 mg magnesium sulfate on lipid profile, as well as insulin resistance and secretion in overweight patients.  Seventy overweight non-diabetic volunteers with Body Mass Index (BMI) >28 kg/ were included in a randomized double blind placebo-controlled clinical trial (ethic number HUMS REC.1394.57) and registered in Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT2012110124756N2 with registration number 24756). They received either placebo or an herbal supplement capsule containing 300 mg magnesium sulfate (MgSO) for 6 months on a daily basis.  control, lipid profile and magnesium status were determined at baseline and every three months. Student t-test, repeated measure ANOVA and ANCOVA were used to compare the groups.  There was no significant difference between groups before intervention, but daily Mg supplement for 6 months significantly improved fasting insulin level (6.71±0.11 to 6.27±0.3 three months after Mg therapy, p<0.01 vs. 6.41±0.11 in control group (5.83±0.063) six months after Mg therapy, p< 0.0001), HOMA-IR (1.52±0.03 )in control group to 1.36±0.03 after three months Mg therapy, p<0.05 vs 1.37±0.05 in control group to 1.22±0.02 six months after Mg therapy, p< 0.05), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) (43.57±0.82 in control group to 43.91±1.92 three months after Mg therapy, p<0.001vs 43.57±0.82 in control group to 46±0.88 six months after Mg therapy, <0.01), triglyceride (TG) (163.17±6.1 in control group to 141.2±5.84 six months after g therapy, p<0.05) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) (112.62±3.41 in control group to 104.42±2.35 six months after Mg therapy, p<0.05).

Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 are important  polarizing cytokines that act through STAT6 by inducing its phosphorylation and promoting transcription of STAT6-responsive genes. Inactivation of STAT6 signaling in macrophages has not been fully explored; however, a recent model suggests that inactivation of STAT6 signaling can occur via ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.

However, the  and pharmacological properties of many of these compounds remain unknown. Elucidating these characteristics allows members of the clinical and forensic communities to identify causative agents in patient samples, as well as render conclusions regarding their toxic effects. This work presents a detailed report on the in vitro phase I  of indazole carboxamide synthetic cannabinoid APP-CHMINACA (PX-3). Incubation of APP-CHMINACA with human liver microsomes, followed by analysis of extracts via high-resolution mass spectrometry, yielded 12 metabolites, encompassing 7 different metabolite classes. Characterization of the metabolites was achieved by evaluating the product ion spectra, accurate mass and chemical formula generated for each metabolite. The predominant biotransformations observed were hydrolysis of the distal amide group and hydroxylation of the cyclohexylmethyl (CHM) substituent. Nine metabolites were amide hydrolysis products, of which five were monohydroxylated, one dihydroxylated and two were ketone products. The metabolites in greatest abundance in the study were products of amide hydrolysis with no further biotransformation (M1), followed by amide hydrolysis with monohydroxylation (.1). Three APP-CHMINACA-specific metabolites were generated, all of which were hydroxylated on the CHM group; one mono-, di- and tri-hydroxylated metabolite each was produced, with dihydroxylation (M6) present in the greatest abundance. The authors propose that metabolites M1, .1 and M6 are the most appropriate markers to determine consumption of APP-CHMINACA. The methods used in the current study have broad applicability and have been used to determine the in vitro  profiles of multiple synthetic cannabinoids and other classes of NPS. This research can be used to guide analytical scientists in method development, synthesis of reference material, pharmacological testing of proposed metabolites and prediction of  processes of compounds yet to be studied.© The Author(s) 2019.

This study revealed an important role for  macrophages and the YM1/Chi3l3 protein in hypertensive nephropathy in a mouse model of hypertension. Bone marrow cells were isolated from the femurs and tibia of male FVB/N (control) and transgenic hypertensive animals that overexpressed the rat form of angiotensinogen (TGM(rAOGEN)123, TGM123-FVB/N). The cells were treated with murine M-CSF and subsequently with LPS+IFN- to promote their polarization into M1 macrophages and IL-4+IL-13 to trigger the  phenotype. We examined the kidneys of TGM123-FVB/N animals to assess macrophage polarization and end-organ damage. mRNA expression was evaluated using real-time PCR, and protein levels were assessed through ELISA, CBA, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. Histology confirmed high levels of renal collagen. Cells stimulated with LPS+IFN- in vitro showed no significant difference in the expression of CD86, an M1 marker, compared to cells from the controls or the hypertensive mice. When stimulated with IL-4+IL-13, however, macrophages of the hypertensive group showed a significant increase in CD206 expression, an  marker. The /M1 ratio reached 288%. Our results indicate that when stimulated , macrophages from hypertensive mice are predisposed toward polarization to an  phenotype. These data support results from the kidneys where we found an increased infiltration of macrophages predominantly polarized to  associated with high levels of YM1/Chi3l3 (91,89%), suggesting that YM1/Chi3l3 may be a biomarker of hypertensive nephropathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095313>Whey Protein Hydrolysate Increases Amino Acid Uptake, mTORC1 Signaling, and Protein Synthesis in Skeletal Muscle of Healthy Young Men in a Randomized Crossover Trial.</a></h2><p>Muscle protein synthesis (MPS) can be stimulated by ingestion of protein sources, such as whey, casein, or soy. Protein supplementation can enhance muscle protein synthesis after exercise and may preserve skeletal muscle mass and function in aging adults. Therefore, identifying protein sources with higher anabolic potency is of high significance.The aim of this study was to determine the anabolic potency and efficacy of a novel whey protein hydrolysate mixture (WPH) on mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and skeletal MPS in healthy young subjects.Ten young men (aged 28.7 ± 3.6 y, 25.2 ± 2.9 kg/ body mass index [BMI]) were recruited into a double-blind two-way crossover trial. Subjects were randomized to receive either 0.08 g/kg of body weight (BW) of WPH or an intact whey protein (WHEY) mixture during stable isotope infusion experiments. Fractional synthetic rate, leucine and phenylalanine kinetics, and markers of amino acid sensing were assessed as primary outcomes before and 1-3 h after protein ingestion using a repeated measures mixed model.Blood leucine concentration, delivery of leucine to muscle, transport of leucine from blood into muscle and intracellular muscle leucine concentration significantly increased to a similar extent 1 h after ingestion of both mixtures (P < 0.05). Phosphorylation of S6K1 (i.e. a marker of mTORC1 activation) increased equally by ∼20% 1-h postingestion (P < 0.05). Ingestion of WPH and WHEY increased mixed MPS similarly in both groups by ∼43% (P < 0.05); however, phenylalanine utilization for synthesis increased in both treatments 1-h postingestion but remained elevated 3-h postingestion only in the WPH group (P < 0.05).We conclude that a small dose of WPH effectively increases leucine transport into muscle, activating mTORC1 and stimulating MPS in young men. WPH anabolic potency and efficacy for promoting overall muscle protein anabolism is similar to WHEY, an intact protein source.

Macrophages are an important component of AT, and are involved in tissue homeostasis, tissue repair and fibrosis. AT-resident macrophages are categorized into two subtypes, the M1-like and -like macrophages. -like macrophages are reported to play anti-inflammatory roles, and to be involved in clearing and removal of dying/dead adipocytes, and recruiting adipocyte progenitors (APs). -like macrophages are also reported to be involved in the promotion of fibrosis in a transforming growth factor-β-dependent manner. However, the precise roles of -like macrophages in the AT have not yet been clearly delineated. Recently, we generated genetically engineered transgenic mice in which CD206 -like macrophages can be conditionally depleted. Unexpectedly, we found that the depletion of CD206 -like macrophages resulted in the enhanced generation of smaller adipocytes, improved insulin sensitivity and proliferation of APs. We further clarified that the CD206 -like macrophages directly interact with the APs to regulate their growth/differentiation and adipogenesis, thereby controlling adiposity and systemic insulin sensitivity. In the present review, we discuss how CD206 -like macrophages provide a niche for APs and maintain glucose homeostasis.© 2019 The Authors.

The mechanisms that enforce macrophage divergence and dictate the phenotypic and  characteristics of  macrophages remain elusive. We show that alternative activation with interleukin (IL)-4 induces expression of metallothionein 3 (MT3) that regulates macrophage polarization and function. MT3 was requisite for  reprograming in IL-4-stimulated macrophages or M(IL-4) macrophages to promote mitochondrial respiration and suppress glycolysis. MT3 fostered an M(IL-4) phenotype, suppressed hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)1α activation, and thwarted the emergence of a proinflammatory M1 program in macrophages. MT3 deficiency augmented macrophage plasticity, resulting in enhanced interferon γ (IFNγ) responsiveness and a dampened M(IL-4) phenotype. Thus, MT3 programs the phenotype and  fate of M(IL-4) macrophages.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31466915>Dysregulated miR-125a promotes angiogenesis through enhanced glycolysis.</a></h2><p>Although neoangiogenesis is a hallmark of chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory arthritis and many cancers, therapeutic agents targeting the vasculature remain elusive.

HMVEC were transfected with anti-miR-125a and angiogenic mechanisms quantified using tube formation assays, transwell invasion chambers, wound repair, RT-PCR and western blot. Real-time analysis of EC  was assessed using the XF-24 Extracellular-Flux Analyzer. Synovial expression of  markers was assessed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent staining. MiR-125a CRISPR/Cas9-based knock-out zebrafish were generated and vascular development assessed. Finally, glycolytic blockade using 3PO, which inhibits Phosphofructokinase-fructose-2,6-bisphophatase 3 (PFKFB3), was assessed in miR-125a-/- ECs and zebrafish embryos.MiR-125a is significantly decreased in PsA synovium and inversely associated with macroscopic vascularity. In-vivo, CRISPR/cas9 miR-125a zebrafish displayed a hyper-branching phenotype. In-vitro, miR-125a inhibition promoted EC tube formation, branching, migration and invasion, effects paralleled by a shift in their  profile towards glycolysis. This  shift was also observed in the PsA synovial vasculature where increased expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), PFKFB3 and Pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme  (PKM2) were demonstrated.

Human peripheral blood-derived monocyte was induced to differentiate into -type TAMs and was identified by flow cytometry. The co-culture model of TAMs and MHCC97H human liver cancer cells was established, and the expression of MAGL in TAMs cells was detected by qRT-PCR. The expression of MAGL in TAMs cells was detected by plasmid transfection. ELISA and qRT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression levels and secretion levels of inflammatory factors in TAMs cells. The subcutaneous tumor model of MHCC97H mice was constructed to observe the effect of different expression of MAGL in TAMs cells with the proliferation of MHCC97H human liver cancer cells in vivo. F-test was used for the measurement of homogeneity of variance between two independent samples. A t-test was used for homogeneity of variance, and the corrected t-test was used for non-homogeneity of variance.  Human peripheral blood-derived monocytes were successfully induced to differentiate into -type TAMs. An in vitro co-culture model was established. qRT-PCR showed that MHCC97H human liver cancer cells significantly down-regulated the expressional level of MAGL in TAMs cells. The constructed subcutaneous tumor model of mice demonstrated that up-regulation up-regulation of MAGL expression in -type TAMs inhibited the proliferation of MHCC97H human liver cancer cells in vivo. Furthermore, the mechanistic study illustrated that the high expression of MAGL promoted the transcription and secretion of inflammatory factors such as interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in -type TAMs cells.  The overexpression of MAGL inhibits the proliferation of MHCC97H hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vivo, and its mechanism may be associated to the release of inflammatory factors that from TAMs cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554233>Vacuolar H-ATPase Subunit V0C Regulates Aerobic Glycolysis of Esophageal Cancer Cells via PKM2 Signaling.</a></h2><p>The vacuolar H-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) subunit V0C (ATP6V0C), a proton-conducting, pore-forming subunit of vacuolar ATPase, maintains pH homeostasis and induces organelle acidification. The intracellular and extracellular pH of cancer cells affects their growth; however, the role of ATP6V0C in highly invasive esophageal cancer cells (ECCs) remains unclear. In this study, we examined the role of ATP6V0C in glucose  in ECCs. The ATP6V0C depletion attenuated ECC proliferation, invasion, and suppressed glucose , as indicated by reduced glucose uptake and decreased lactate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in cells. Consistent with this, expression of glycolytic enzyme and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were also decreased by ATP6V0C knockdown. Mechanistically, ATP6V0C interacted with pyruvate kinase isoform  (PKM2), a key regulator of glycolysis in ECCs. The ATP6V0C depletion reduced PKM2 phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 105 (Tyr), leading to inhibition of nuclear translocation of PKM2. In addition, ATP6V0C was recruited at hypoxia response element (HRE) sites in the lactate dehydrogenase A () gene for glycolysis.

We addressed this question using, as a model system, the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase  (PKM2). We show that the PKM2 activator fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) alone promotes tetramerisation and increases PKM2 activity, but addition of the inhibitor L-phenylalanine (Phe) prevents maximal activation of FBP-bound PKM2 tetramers. We developed a method, AlloHubMat, that uses eigenvalue decomposition of mutual information derived from molecular dynamics trajectories to identify residues that mediate FBP-induced allostery. Experimental mutagenesis of these residues identified PKM2 variants in which activation by FBP remains intact but cannot be attenuated by Phe. Our findings reveal residues involved in FBP-induced allostery that enable the integration of allosteric input from Phe and provide a paradigm for the coordinate regulation of enzymatic activity by simultaneous allosteric inputs.© 2019, Macpherson et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638225>SSTR5‑AS1 functions as a ceRNA to regulate CA2 by sponging miR‑15b‑5p for the development and prognosis of HBV‑related hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in the development and progression of cancer. However, the mechanisms of lncRNAs in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection‑induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. The study aimed to reveal the roles of lncRNAs for HBV‑HCC based on the hypothesis of competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). The lncRNA (GSE27462), miRNA (GSE76903) and mRNA (GSE121248) expression profiles were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs), genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMs) were identified using the LIMMA or EdgeR package, respectively. The ceRNA network was constructed based on interaction pairs between miRNAs and mRNAs/lncRNAs. The functions of DEGs in the ceRNA network were predicted using the DAVID database, which was overlapped with the known HCC  of Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) to construct the HCC‑related ceRNA network. The prognosis values [overall survival, (OS); recurrence‑free survival (RFS)] of genes were validated using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data with Cox regression analysis.

Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that six RNAs (2 DELs: FAM138B, SSTR5‑AS1; 2 DEMs: hsa‑miR‑149, hsa‑miR‑7; 2 DEGs: CCNE2, RRM2) were significantly associated with OS; while seven RNAs (1 DEL: LINC00284; 3 DEMs: hsa‑miR‑7, hsa‑miR‑15b, hsa‑miR‑30c‑2; and 3 DEGs: RRM2, CCNE2, CA2) were significantly associated with RFS. In conclusion, FAM138B‑hsa‑miR‑30c‑CCNE2/RRM2 and the SSTR5‑AS1‑hsa‑miR‑15b‑5p‑CA2 ceRNA axes may be important mechanisms for HBV‑related HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567014>Apolipoprotein AI) Promotes Atherosclerosis Regression in Diabetic Mice by Suppressing Myelopoiesis and Plaque Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Despite robust cholesterol lowering, cardiovascular disease risk remains increased in patients with diabetes mellitus. Consistent with this, diabetes mellitus impairs atherosclerosis regression after cholesterol lowering in humans and mice. In mice, this is attributed in part to hyperglycemia-induced monocytosis, which increases monocyte entry into plaques despite cholesterol lowering. In addition, diabetes mellitus skews plaque macrophages toward an atherogenic inflammatory M1 phenotype instead of toward the atherosclerosis-resolving  state typical with cholesterol lowering. Functional high-density lipoprotein (HDL), typically low in patients with diabetes mellitus, reduces monocyte precursor proliferation in murine bone marrow and has anti-inflammatory effects on human and murine macrophages. Our study aimed to test whether raising functional HDL levels in diabetic mice prevents monocytosis, reduces the quantity and inflammation of plaque macrophages, and enhances atherosclerosis regression after cholesterol lowering.Aortic arches containing plaques developed in  mice were transplanted into either wild-type, diabetic wild-type, or diabetic mice transgenic for human apolipoprotein AI, which have elevated functional HDL. Recipient mice all had low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to promote plaque regression. After 2 weeks, plaques in recipient mouse aortic grafts were examined.Diabetic wild-type mice had impaired atherosclerosis regression, which was normalized by raising HDL levels. This benefit was linked to suppressed hyperglycemia-driven myelopoiesis, monocytosis, and neutrophilia. Increased HDL improved cholesterol efflux from bone marrow progenitors, suppressing their proliferation and monocyte and neutrophil production capacity. In addition to reducing circulating monocytes available for recruitment into plaques, in the diabetic milieu, HDL suppressed the general recruitability of monocytes to inflammatory sites and promoted plaque macrophage polarization to the , atherosclerosis-resolving state. There was also a decrease in plaque neutrophil extracellular traps, which are atherogenic and increased by diabetes mellitus.Raising apolipoprotein AI and functional levels of HDL promotes multiple favorable changes in the production of monocytes and neutrophils and in the inflammatory environment of atherosclerotic plaques of diabetic mice after cholesterol lowering and may represent a novel approach to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in people with diabetes mellitus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31234171>Frequency of Hypoglycaemia after Different Bariatric Surgical Procedures.</a></h2><p>The frequency of postprandial hypoglycaemia after different operative procedures of bariatric surgery (BS) is unknown, although this complication is potentially dangerous. Predictors and severity of hypoglycaemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy, and gastric banding were investigated in a large prospective study.This study was performed at an excellence centre for BS at a tertiary care institution. Data of 333 patients (mean BMI: 44.9 ± 9.6 kg/; mean age: 40 ± 10 years; 80.7% women) were analysed in a prospective study with a 2-year observation period after BS. All patients underwent a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with measurements of blood glucose (BG) and insulin. For the purpose of this study, hypoglycaemia was defined as a post-challenge BG <2.8 mmol/L during the OGTT.72 (25.6%) of 281 patients showed post-challenge hypoglycaemia after surgery. Hypoglycaemia was different after various procedures: 32.6% of patients after RYGB, 22.6% after sleeve gastrectomy, but only 2.3% after gastric banding had hypoglycaemia. In the whole group, patients with hypoglycaemia had lost more weight (p = 0.013), had a slightly greater decrease in BMI (p = 0.037), a greater change in 2-hour post-challenge BG (p = 0.001), and a smaller change in 1-hour post-challenge insulin (p = 0.004) compared to patients without hypoglycaemia.This prospective study shows a higher prevalence of severe hypoglycaemia (25.6%) after BS than anticipated from retrospective registers. A systematic evaluation of glucose and insulin levels by OGTT 2 years post-surgery may help to identify patients at increased risk for symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

The intracellular apicomplexa parasite  induces a Warburg-like effect in host leukocytes by hijacking signaling machineries, epigenetic regulators and transcriptional programs to create a transformed cell state. The molecular mechanisms underlying host cell transformation are unclear. Here we show that a parasite-encoded prolyl-isomerase, TaPin1, stabilizes host pyruvate kinase isoform  (PKM2) leading to HIF-1α-dependent regulation of  enzymes, glucose uptake and transformed phenotypes in parasite-infected cells. Our results provide a direct molecular link between the secreted parasite TaPin1 protein and host gene expression programs.

We explored the plasma pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution, and excretion of mHA11 in rats using a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. Next, we identified the metabolites of mHA11 and assessed the influence of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes on mHA11 . We also examined the in vitro stability in rat plasma and rat liver microsomes (RLMs), the blood-to plasma (B/P) ratio, and the inhibitory effect on CYP isozyme activities. After oral administration at 5, 15, and 45 mg/kg, mHA11 was absorbed and eliminated rapidly. There was a linear correlation between the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and the dose (R = 0.983). The bioavailability of mHA11 was 4.1% at the oral dose of 15 mg/kg mHA11 was extensively distributed in various tissues and exhibited a high penetration into the brain. No significant parent drug was detected in urine or bile, and only 0.74% was recovered in feces, whereas two demethylated metabolites, M1 and , were found in the urine and feces, and further studies showed that CYP2C19 primarily contributed to metabolites formation. mHA11 was stable in rat plasma but degraded significantly in RLMs; its B/P ratio was 1.05 in rat blood. In addition, mHA11 dose-dependently inhibited the activities of rat CYP isozymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2C6, CYP2C11, CYP2D2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A2. The present study is the first report on the disposition of mHA11 in rats and provides important data for further research and development of this inhibitor.Copyright © 2019.

Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), metabolite profiling of guanfacine was performed in plasma and urine collected from healthy Japanese adults following repeated oral administration of guanfacine extended-release formulation. Unchanged guanfacine was the most abundant component in both plasma and urine (from the MS signal intensity). In plasma, the M3 metabolite (a sulfate of hydroxy-guanfacine) was the prominent metabolite; the  metabolite (a glucuronide of a metabolite formed by monooxidation of guanfacine), 3-hydroxyguanfacine and several types of glucuronide at different positions on guanfacine were also detected. In urine, the  metabolite and 3-hydroxyguanfacine were the principal metabolites. From metabolite analysis, the proposed main  pathway of guanfacine is monooxidation on the dichlorobenzyl moiety, followed by glucuronidation or sulfation. A minor pathway is glucuronidation at different positions on guanfacine. As the prominent metabolites in plasma were glucuronide and sulfate of hydroxyguanfacine, which have no associated toxicity concerns, further toxicity studies of the metabolites, for example in animals, were not deemed necessary.© 2019 The Authors.

The aim of the present study was to explore the impact of individual characteristics on maximum IVC diameter (IVCmax), Ao, and IVCmax/Ao in healthy Chinese children. From September to December 2015, 200 healthy children from 1 to 13 years of age were enrolled. IVCmax and Ao diameters were measured by 2D ultrasound. We found that age (years), height (cm), weight (kg), waist circumference (cm), and BSA () were positively correlated with IVCmax and Ao. Multivariate linear regression showed that age was the only independent variable for IVCmax (mm) in female children, height was the only independent variable for IVCmax in male children, and age was the only independent variable for Ao in both females and males. IVCmax/Ao was not significantly influenced by the subjects' characteristics. In conclusion, IVCmax and Ao were more susceptible to subjects' characteristics than IVCmax/Ao. IVCmax/Ao could be a reliable and practical parameter in Chinese children as it was independent of age, height, and weight.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049647>Transcriptional control of macrophage polarisation in type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>Type-2 diabetes (T2D) is considered today as an inflammatory disease. Inflammatory processes in T2D are orchestrated by macrophage activation in different organs. Macrophages undergo classical M1 pro-inflammatory or alternative  anti-inflammatory activation in response to tissue microenvironmental signals. These subsets of macrophages are characterised by their expression of cell surface markers, secreted cytokines and chemokines. Transcriptional regulation is central to the polarisation of macrophages, and several major  have been described as essential to promote the expression of specific genes, which dictate the functional polarisation of macrophages.

Chelidonine (CHE) is a major constituent of the herb and has been reported to be an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP). The major objective of the present study was to study the   of CHE in order to identify potential reactive metabolites responsible for the enzyme inhibition. Three oxidative metabolites (M1-M3) were detected in human liver microsomal incubations after exposure to CHE. M1 and  were two isomers of catechol derivatives, and M3 was a dicatechol compound. The M1-M3 metabolites were also observed in bile of rats given CHE. A total of five glutathione (GSH) conjugates (M4-M8) were detected in microsomes containing CHE, GSH, and NADPH. Moreover, M4 and M6 originated from M1, M5 and M7 resulted from , and M8 was a M3-derived GSH conjugate. Three biliary CHE-derived GSH conjugates (M4, M5 and M8) were found in CHE-treated rats. This indicates that CHE was bioactivated to ortho-quinone derivatives both in vitro and in vivo. Recombinant P450 enzyme incubations demonstrated that the CYPs3A4, 1A2, 2C19 and 2D6 were mainly involved in  activation of CHE. This study generated data that may be useful in understanding possible mechanisms of CHE-induced P450 inhibition.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional Chinese medicine could be an alternative therapeutic option for poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. YH1 is a concentrated Chinese herbal extract formula that combines Rhizoma Coptidis and Shen-Ling-Bai-Zhu-San. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study evaluated YH1 as an add-on medication for poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.Forty-six patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned 1:1 to the YH1 or placebo group. Before the trial, all subjects had received three or more classes of OHAs with HbA1c > 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and a body mass index ≥ 23 kg/. During the 12-week trial, participants continued to take OHAs without any dose or medication changes. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in HbA1c level. Per-protocol analysis was applied to the final evaluation.At week 12, there was an 11.1% reduction in HbA1c from baseline and a 68.9% increase in homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) of β cell function in the YH1 group, which also exhibited significant reductions in two-hour postprandial glucose (-26.2%), triglycerides (-29.5%), total cholesterol (-21.6%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-17.4%), body weight (-0.5%), and waist circumference (-1.1%). The changes in fasting plasma glucose, HOMA insulin resistance and symptom scores were not significantly different between the YH1 and placebo groups. No serious adverse events occurred during this clinical trial.This pilot study indicates that YH1 together with OHAs can improve hypoglycemic action and β-cell function in overweight/obese patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. YH1 is a safe add-on medication for OHAs and has beneficial effects on weight control and lipid .

The mechanisms for weight compensation are unclear.The aim of this study was to identify the mechanisms responsible for compensation.In a randomized controlled trial conducted at an academic research center, adults (n = 198) with overweight or obesity were randomized for 24 wk to a no-exercise control group or 1 of 2 supervised exercise groups: 8 kcal/kg of body weight/wk (KKW) or 20 KKW. Outcome assessment occurred at weeks 0 and 24. Energy intake, activity, and resting  rate (RMR) were measured with doubly labeled water (DLW; with and without adjustments for change in RMR), armband accelerometers, and indirect calorimetry, respectively. Appetite and compensatory health beliefs were measured by self-report.A per-protocol analysis included 171 participants (72.5% women; mean ± SD baseline body mass index: 31.5 ± 4.7 kg/). Significant (P < 0.01) compensation occurred in the 8 KKW (mean: 1.5 kg; 95% CI: 0.9, 2.2 kg) and 20 KKW (mean: 2.7 kg; 95% CI: 2.0, 3.5 kg) groups, and compensation differed significantly between the exercise groups (P = 0.01). Energy intake by adjusted DLW increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the 8 KKW (mean: 90.7 kcal/d; 95% CI: 35.1, 146.4 kcal/d) and 20 KKW (mean: 123.6 kcal/d; 95% CI: 64.5, 182.7 kcal/d) groups compared with control (mean: -2.3 kcal/d; 95% CI: -58.0, 53.5 kcal/d). Results were similar without DLW adjustment. RMR and physical activity (excluding structured exercise) did not differentially change among the 3 groups. Participants with higher compared with lower compensation reported increased appetite ratings and beliefs that healthy behaviors can compensate for unhealthy behaviors. Furthermore, they increased craving for sweet foods, increased sleep disturbance, and had worsening bodily pain.Compensation resulted from increased energy intake and concomitant increases in appetite, which can be treated with dietary or pharmacological interventions.

There are indications that glucose  and insulin sensitivity, which are generally disturbed in overweight and obese individuals, may improve by increased dairy intake. This may also affect one's  flexibility.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of high compared with low dairy intake on glucose , insulin sensitivity, and  flexibility in overweight adults (aged 45-65 y).In this randomized intervention study, subjects consumed a high- and a low-dairy diet [HDD (5-6 dairy portions) and LDD (≤1 dairy portion), respectively] for 6 wk in a crossover design, with a washout period of 4 wk. Dairy portions were 200 g semi-skimmed yoghurt, 30 g reduced-fat (30+) cheese, and 250 mL semiskimmed milk and buttermilk. After 6 wk, a 75-g oral-glucose-tolerance test (13C-labeled) and a subsequent fasting challenge were performed.  flexibility was studied by determining the respiratory quotient (RQ) using indirect calorimetry. Fasting and postprandial plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin were analyzed. The dual isotope technique enabled calculation of glucose kinetics.The study was completed by 45 overweight men and postmenopausal women [age 58.9 ± 4.3 y, BMI 27.9 ± 1.9 kg/ (mean ± SD)]. Fasting RQ and ΔRQ, reflecting  flexibility, did not differ after both diets. Fasting glucose concentrations were similar, whereas fasting insulin concentrations were lower after the LDD (LDD: 8.1 ± 2.8 mU/L; HDD: 8.9 ± 3.3 mU/L; P = 0.024). This resulted in a higher HOMA-IR after the HDD (P = 0.027). Postprandial glucose and insulin responses as well as glucose kinetics were similar after both diets.The amount of dairy intake during a 6-wk period had a neutral effect on  flexibility or postprandial glucose  in middle-aged overweight subjects.

Secondary objectives were to determine the impact of KE on nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration and glucoregulatory hormones.We conducted a randomized controlled crossover experiment in 15 individuals with obesity (mean ± SD age: 47 ± 10 y; BMI: 34 ± 5 kg/). After an overnight fast, participants consumed a KE drink [(R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate; 0.45 mL/kg body weight] or taste-matched control drink 30 min before completing a 75-g OGTT. Participants and study personnel performing laboratory analyses were blinded to each condition.The KE increased d-β-hydroxybutyrate to a maximum of ∼3.4 mM (P < 0.001) during the OGTT. Compared with the control drink, KE reduced glucose (-11%, P = 0.002), NEFA (-21%, P = 0.009), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (-31%, P = 0.001) areas under the curve (AUCs), whereas glucagon AUC increased (+11%, P = 0.030).

Although DLW may reveal true physiological differences undetected by respiratory chambers, an alternative possibility is that the expenditure differences resulted from failure to correctly estimate the respiratory quotient (RQ) used in the DLW calculations.To examine energy expenditure differences between isocaloric diets varying widely in carbohydrate and to quantitatively compare DLW data with respiratory chamber and body composition measurements within an energy balance framework.DLW measurements were obtained during the final 2 wk of month-long baseline (BD; 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat, 15% protein) and isocaloric ketogenic diets (KD; 5% carbohydrate, 80% fat, 15% protein) in 17 men with a BMI of 25-35 kg/. Subjects resided 2 d/wk in respiratory chambers to measure energy expenditure (EEchamber). DLW expenditure was calculated using chamber-determined RQ either unadjusted (EEDLW) or adjusted (EEDLWΔRQ) for net energy imbalance using diet-specific coefficients. Accelerometers measured physical activity. Body composition changes were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) which were combined with energy intake measurements to calculate energy expenditure by balance (EEbal).After transitioning from BD to KD, neither EEchamber nor EEbal were significantly changed (∆EEchamber = 24 ± 30 kcal/d; P = 0.43 and ∆EEbal = -141 ± 118 kcal/d; P = 0.25). Similarly, physical activity (-5.1 ± 4.8%; P = 0.3) and exercise efficiency (-1.6 ± 2.4%; P = 0.52) were not significantly changed. However, EEDLW was 209 ± 83 kcal/d higher during the KD (P = 0.023) but was not significantly increased when adjusted for energy balance (EEDLWΔRQ = 139 ± 89 kcal/d; P = 0.14). After removing 2 outliers whose EEDLW were incompatible with other data, EEDLW was marginally increased during the KD by 126 ± 62 kcal/d (P = 0.063) and EEDLW∆RQ was only 46 ± 65 kcal/d higher (P = 0.49).DLW calculations failing to account for diet-specific energy imbalance effects on RQ erroneously suggest that low-carbohydrate diets substantially increase energy expenditure.

Studies with various human liver subcellular fractions established that the formation of M12 was NAD(P)H-independent and proceeded in cytosol and S9 fractions but not in microsomal or mitochondrial fractions. The formation of M12 was inhibited by ethacrynic acid, an inhibitor of glutathione -transferases (GSTs). Several human recombinant GSTs, including GSTA1, A2-2, M1a, -2, T1-1, and GST from human placenta, were incubated with AZD1979. All GSTs tested catalyzed the formation of M12, with GSTA2-2 being the most efficient. Metabolite M12 was purified from rat liver S9 incubations and its structure elucidated by NMR. These results establish that M12 is the product of the GST-catalyzed glutathione attack on the carbon atom  to the nitrogen atom of the strained spiro-azetidinyl moiety to give, after ring opening, the corresponding amino-thioether conjugate product, a direct conjugation pathway that occurs without the prior substrate bioactivation by P450. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The investigated compound, AZD1979, contains a 6-substituted-2-oxa-6-azaspiro[3.3]heptanyl derivative that is an example of strained heterocycles, including spiro-fused ring systems, that are widely used in synthetic organic chemistry. An unusual azetidinyl ring-opening reaction involving a nucleophilic attack by glutathione, which does not involve prior cytochrome P450-catalyzed bioactivation of the substrate and which is catalyzed by glutathione transferases, is reported. We propose a mechanism involving the protonated cyclic aminyl intermediate that undergoes nucleophilic attack by glutathione thiolate anion in this reaction, catalyzed by glutathione transferases.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175763>Type 2 diabetes mellitus remission and its prediction after two-stage surgical treatment of patients with morbid obesity.</a></h2><p>Introduction: Morbid obesity (MO) has a significant impact on mortality, health and quality of life of patients. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common comorbidity in patients with MO. The aim is to study T2DM remission and to develop a prediction model for T2DM remission after two-stage surgical treatment of patients with MO.Materials and methods: The study included 97 patients with MO. The mean BMI was 68.08 (95% CI: 66.45 - 69.71) kg/. 70 (72,2%) patients with MO were diagnosed with T2DM. The first stage of treatment for the main group (n=60) included the IGB placement, for the control group (n=37) - conservative therapy. In the second stage of treatment the patients underwent bariatric surgery. The study addresses such indicators as BMI, percentage of weight loss, percentage of excess weight loss, ASA physical status class, fasting glucose level, HbA1c, C-peptide.Results: Two-stage treatment of morbidly obese patients with T2DM promotes complete T2DM remission in 68.1% of patients. The risk prediction model for failure to achieve complete T2DM remission 12 months after LRYGB based on a baseline C-peptide level has a high predictive value, AUC = 0.84 (95% CI: 0.69-0.93), OR = 0.23 ( 95% CI: 0.08-0.67).Conclusions: Two-stage treatment of patients with MO promotes improvement of carbohydrate  indicators. With a C-peptide level > 3.7 ng/ml, prediction of complete T2DM remission 12 months after Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass is favorable.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430745>The Organ Handling of Soluble Klotho in Humans.</a></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) reduces both Klotho expression and its shedding into circulation, an effect that accelerates progression and cardiovascular complications. However, the mechanisms that regulate Klotho release by the human kidney are still unknown.We measured plasma Klotho across the kidney, splanchnic organs and lung in 22 patients (71 ± 2 years, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 60 ± 5.4 mL/min 1.73 ) during elective diagnostic cardiac catheterizations.Although the Klotho average renal vein concentrations were remarkably higher (by ∼9%) than arterial values, the kidney removed Klotho (or was at zero balance) in 7 subjects, indicating that the kidney contribution to systemic Klotho is not constant. Klotho fractional enrichment across the kidney was inversely related to plasma sodium (r = 0.43, p = 0.045) and acid uric acid levels (r = 0.38, p = 0.084) and directly, to renal oxygen extraction (r = 0.56, p = 0.006). In multivariate analysis, renal oxygen extraction was the only predictor of the enrichment of Klotho across the kidney, suggesting the dependence of renal Klotho release on tubular hypoxia or oxidative . Klotho balance was neutral across the lung. In patients with eGFR <60 mL/min, Klotho was also removed by splanchnic organs (single pass fractional extraction ∼11%).The present study identifies kidney oxygen uptake as a predictor of Klotho release, and splanchnic organs as a site for Klotho removal. This study provides new understanding of kidney Klotho release and suggests that modulating kidney oxygen  could increase Klotho delivery, as an option to slow disease progression and blunt organ damage.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

Mice with Treg cell-restricted Neuropilin-1 deficiency show tumor resistance while maintaining peripheral immune homeostasis, thereby providing a controlled system to interrogate the impact of intratumoral Treg cells on the TME. Using this and other genetic models, we showed that Treg cells shaped the transcriptional landscape across multiple tumor-infiltrating immune cell types. Treg cells suppressed CD8 T cell secretion of interferon-γ (IFNγ), which would otherwise block the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-mediated fatty acid synthesis in immunosuppressive (-like) tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Thus, Treg cells indirectly but selectively sustained -like TAM  fitness, mitochondrial integrity, and survival. SREBP1 inhibition augmented the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade, suggesting that targeting Treg cells or their modulation of lipid  in -like TAMs could improve cancer immunotherapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) infusions have recently been suggested to alleviate myocardial injury and ameliorate cardiac function. However, few studies have focused on the effects of MSCs in DCM. Therefore, we explored the effects of MSC-regulated macrophage polarization on myocardial repair in DCM.A DCM rat model was induced by a high-fat diet and streptozotocin (STZ) administration and infused 4 times with MSCs. Rat blood and heart tissue were analyzed for blood glucose levels, lipid levels, echocardiography, histopathology, macrophage phenotype ratios and inflammatory cytokines, respectively. We mimicked chronic inflammation in vitro by inducing peritoneal macrophages with high glucose and LPS, then cocultured these macrophages with MSCs to explore the specific mechanism of MSCs on macrophage polarization.DCM rats exhibited abnormal blood glucose levels and lipid , cardiac inflammation and dysfunction. MSC infusion ameliorated  abnormalities and preserved cardiac structure and function in DCM rats. Moreover, MSC infusion significantly increased the  phenotype macrophages and alleviated cardiac inflammation. Interestingly, this in vitro study revealed that the MSCs pretreated with a COX-2 inhibitor had little effect on  macrophage polarization, but this phenomenon could be reversed by adding prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).Our results suggested that MSC infusions can protect against cardiac injury in DCM rats. The underlying mechanisms may include MSC-enhanced  macrophage polarization via the COX-2-PGE2 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31166482>Lipid profile and statin use in critical care setting: implications for kidney outcome.</a></h2><p>To determine whether pre-hospital statin use is associated with lower renal replacement therapy requirement and/or death during intensive care unit stay.Prospective cohort analysis. We analyzed 670 patients consecutively admitted to the intensive care unit of an academic tertiary-care hospital.

The statin group comprised 18.2% of patients and had lower renal replacement therapy requirement and/or mortality (OR: 0.41; 95%CI: 0.18-0.93; p=0.03). The statin group also had lower risk of developing sepsis during intensive care unit stay (OR: 0.42; 95%CI: 0.22-0.77; p=0.006) and had a reduction in hospital length-of-stay (14.7±17.5 days versus 22.3±48 days; p=0.006). Statin therapy was associated with a protective role in critical care setting independently of confounding variables, such as gender, age, C-reactive protein, need of mechanical ventilation, use of pressor agents and presence of diabetes and/or coronary disease.Statin therapy prior to hospital admission was associated with lower mortality, lower renal replacement therapy requirement and sepsis rates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391918>PKM2, function and expression and regulation.</a></h2><p>Pyruvate kinase (PK), as one of the key enzymes for glycolysis, can encode four different subtypes from two groups of genes, although the  subtype PKM2 is expressed mainly during embryonic development in normal humans, and is closely related to tissue repair and regeneration, with the deepening of research, the role of PKM2 in tumor tissue has received increasing attention. PKM2 can be aggregated into tetrameric and dimeric forms, PKM2 in the dimer state can enter the nuclear to regulate gene expression, the transformation between them can play an important role in tumor cell energy supply, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion and metastasis and cell proliferation. We will use the switching effect of PKM2 in glucose  as the entry point to expand and enrich the Warburg effect. In addition, PKM2 can also regulate each other with various proteins by phosphorylation, acetylation and other modifications, mediate the different intracellular localization of PKM2 and then exert specific biological functions.

Primary tumors surrounded with and infiltrated by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) significantly promote the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and distant metastasis in urothelial bladder cancer.In this study, we aimed to explore the potential of targeting TAMs for the treatment of malignant bladder cancer.First, we found a higher number of TAMs, CD68 (pan-macrophage marker), and clever-1 ( macrophage marker) was associated with a higher pT category and grade in a cohort of 108 patients. In vitro assays showed that the co-culture of TAMs promoted the metastatic potential in HTB-1 and T24 by up-regulating EMT markers including Snail, VEGF and Vimentin, as well as oncogenic markers such as β-catenin and NF-κB. More importantly,  co-cultured HTB-1 and T24 showed an increased level of metastatic microRNA, miR-30. Silencing of miR-30 resulted in the reduced metastatic potential, migration/invasion, in association with the decreased expression of Twist1 and Vimentin. The addition of BAY11-7082 into the TAM/cancer co-culture system significantly reduced the  phenotype and tumorigenic properties. Coincidentally, miR-30a level was significantly lowered in the presence of BAY11-7082.Our study demonstrated that AMs promoted metastatic potential of bladder cancer cells via promoting EMT through the increase of miR-30a.

Therefore, it is essential for protection against atherosclerosis (AS). In AS plaques, the key cells involved in lipid  and inflammation are macrophages. However, the mechanism by which LXRα regulates macrophage involvement in AS formation remains unclear. In this study, we first confirmed the effects of an LXRα agonist (T0901317) and antagonist (GSK2033) on foam cell formation and inflammation  and . Indeed, T0901317 reduced the number of macrophages in AS plaques and decreased the number of migrated macrophages, as assessed using an  transwell assay. Next, we investigated the relationship between the reduction in macrophages in AS plaques and cytokine levels or foam cell formation. The results show that T0901317 reduced the number of high cholesterol-induced M1 macrophages by converting them into  macrophages  and . Due to this phenotypic transition of macrophages, the inflammatory response was alleviated, and lipid  was enhanced in AS plaques. This effect was achieved by promoting the expression of reverse transporters (ATP-binding cassette transporter member 1 and ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 1) and inhibiting the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB-mediated phosphorylation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31019294>Pirfenidone prevents and reverses hepatic insulin resistance and steatohepatitis by polarizing  macrophages.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with lipotoxic liver injury, leading to insulin resistance, inflammation, and fibrosis. Despite its increased global incidence, very few promising treatments for NASH are available. Pirfenidone is an antifibrotic agent used to treat pulmonary fibrosis; it suppresses the pulmonary influx of T cells and macrophages. Here, we investigated the effect of pirfenidone in a mouse model of lipotoxicity-induced NASH via a high-cholesterol and high-fat diet. After 12 weeks of feeding, pirfenidone administration attenuated excessive hepatic lipid accumulation and peroxidation by reducing the expression of genes related to lipogenesis and fatty acid synthesis and enhancing the expression of those related to fatty acid oxidation. Flow cytometry indicated that pirfenidone reduced the number of total hepatic macrophages, particularly CD11cCD206(M1)-type macrophages, increased the number of CD11cCD206()-type macrophages, and subsequently reduced T-cell numbers, which helped improve insulin resistance and steatohepatitis. Moreover, pirfenidone downregulated the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mRNA expression of M1 marker genes and upregulated IL-4-induced  marker genes in a dose-dependent manner in RAW264.7 macrophages. Importantly, pirfenidone reversed insulin resistance, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis in mice with pre-existing NASH.

Due to the atrium-specific expression of TASK-1 in the human heart and the functional upregulation of TASK-1 currents in atrial fibrillation (AF), TASK-1 represents a promising target for the treatment of AF. Therefore, detailed knowledge of the molecular determinants of TASK-1 inhibition may help to identify new drugs for the future therapy of AF. In the current study, the molecular determinants of TASK-1 inhibition by the potent and antiarrhythmic compound A293 (AVE1231) were studied in detail.Alanine-scanning mutagenesis together with two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings were combined with in silico docking experiments.Here, we have identified Q126 located in the  segment together with L239 and N240 of the M4 segment as amino acids essential for the A293-mediated inhibition of TASK-1. These data indicate a binding site which is different to that of A1899 for which also residues of the pore signature sequence and the late M4 segments are essential. Using in silico docking experiments, we propose a binding site at the lower end of the cytosolic pore, located at the entry to lateral side fenestrations of TASK-1. Strikingly, TASK-1 inhibition by the low affinity antiarrhythmic TASK-1 blockers propafenone, amiodarone and carvedilol was also strongly diminished by mutations at this novel binding site.We have identified the A293 binding site in the central cavity of TASK-1 and propose that this site might represent a conserved site of action for many low affinity antiarrhythmic TASK-1 blockers.© Copyright by the Author(s).

It is associated with high mortality rates and very few effective treatment options. Bisperoxovanadium (pyridine-2-carboxyl) [bpV(pic)] is an commercially available inhibitor of Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Previous studies have shown that bpV(pic) has protective effects in central nervous system. However, the role of bpV(pic) in TBI is unclear. In this study we aimed to investigate the neuroprotective role of bpV(pic) in rat TBI model. We found that injection of bpV(pic) significantly reduces brain edema and neurological dysfunction after TBI and this is mediated by AKT pathway. TBI is known to promote the M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype of microglial polarization and this effect is inhibited by bpV(pic) treatment which, instead promotes  microglial polarization in vivo and in vitro. We also found evidence of bpV(pic)-regulated neuroinflammation mediated by AKT activation and NF-κB p65 inhibition. BpV(pic) treatment also suppressed microglia in the peri-TBI region. MCP-1 is known to recruit monocytes and macrophages to promote inflammation, we show that bpV(pic) can inhibit TBI-induced up-regulation of MCP-1 via the AKT/NF-κB p65 signaling pathway. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that bpV(pic) plays a neuroprotective role in rat TBI, which may be achieved by inhibiting M1 microglia polarization and MCP-1 expression by modulating AKT/NF-κB p65 signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), an alternative  pathway that operates parallel to glycolysis, not only provides key intermediates for biosynthetic reactions but also controls the fate of neural stem/progenitor cells. We have previously shown that glutamate application leads to the induction of neural progenitor cells in mature ex vivo rat retina. In this study, we investigated whether regulation of the PPP might be changed following glutamate treatment of the retina. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the amount of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP as well as that of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), another enzyme in this pathway, increased in the glutamate-treated retina. Consistent with the fact that both these enzymes generate reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), the amount of NAPDH in the treated retina was significantly higher compared with that in the untreated retina. We also found that both DNA synthesis as well as the expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN) increased significantly in the glutamate-treated retina. Furthermore, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α), a positive transcriptional regulator of PPP enzymes, was up-regulated at both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Finally, we found the interaction of HIF-1α with the  isozyme of pyruvate kinase (PKM2), with this interaction having been shown to contribute to a positive feedback loop in the control of glycolysis.

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using DXA. Twenty-four inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed. Incident falls over 3 y were determined through telephone interviews every 4 mo. Multiple regression, linear mixed effects models, negative binomial regression, and mediation analysis were utilized in this study.A higher E-DII score (indicating a more proinflammatory diet) was associated with higher concentrations of IL-6 (β: 0.028 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.053), IL-7 (β: 0.020 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.037), and TNF-α (β: 0.027 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.051). A higher E-DII score was also associated with lower appendicular lean mass adjusted for BMI (ALMBMI) (β: -0.006 kg/; 95% CI: -0.010, -0.001). For every unit increase in E-DII (range: -4.91 to +3.66 units), incident falls rates increased by 13% (incidence rate ratio: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.21) over 3 y. Mediation analysis showed that the association between E-DII and 3-y incident falls was influenced by the concentrations of IL-7 by 24%. There was no association between E-DII and BMD.Consumption of a proinflammatory diet was associated with increased concentrations of IL-6, IL-7, and TNF-α; increased falls risk; and lower ALMBMI in community-dwelling older men.

Insulin resistance was assessed via the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (primary endpoint) and confirmed by [6-6-2H2]-glucose-labeled, 2-step hyperinsulinemic clamp (n = 20). Clinically relevant cardiometabolic endpoints [including flow-mediated dilatation, augmentation index, lipoprotein status (by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy), and nitric oxide (NO)-related metabolite assay] and anthocyanin  were assessed.A daily intake of 1 cup of blueberries improved endothelial function (flow-mediated dilatation: +1.45%; 95% CI: 0.83%, 2.1%; P = 0.003), systemic arterial stiffness (augmentation index: -2.24%; 95% CI: -3.97%, -0.61%; P = 0.04) and attenuated cyclic guanosine monophosphate concentrations.

To correlate STS with cancer , we determined the effects of STS on aerobic glycolysis. STS overexpression increased cellular levels of lactic acid, the final product of aerobic glycolysis. Moreover, STS suppressed the oxygen consumption rate (OCR), which represents mitochondrial respiration. Inhibition of STS by the specific inhibitor STX064 recovered STS-induced OCR repression and lactic acid over-production. DHEA, but not DHEA-S, suppressed the OCR level and enhanced lactic acid production. To understand the molecular mechanism of STS-induced cancer , we measured the expression of glycolytic enzymes hexokinase 2 (HK2) and pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), which was highly upregulated by STS and DHEA at both protein and mRNA levels. HIF1α is a key mediator of aerobic glycolysis, and STS enhanced HIF1α promoter activity, mRNA expression, and protein expression. Down-regulation of HIF1α by siRNA suppressed the HK2 and PKM2 expression induced by both STS and DHEA. HIF1α siRNA also recovered the OCR repression and lactic acid over-production induced by both STS and DHEA. To explore the mechanism in vivo, we produced transgenic mice overexpressing STS and found that STS expression was particularly enhanced in the lung. Consistent with our in vitro results, the expression of HIF1α, HK2, and PKM2 was also increased in mouse lung tissues. In conclusion, we suggest that STS may induce aerobic glycolysis through enhancing HIF1α expression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we developed a guanidine-rich, spherical helical polypeptide (DPP) with multivalency-assisted strong membrane penetrating capability, which mediated effective RNAi against tumor glycolysis  to sensitize PTT. ICG was loaded into the internal cavity of DPP, and siRNA against pyruvate kinase  (siPKM2) was condensed by DPP to form positively charged nanocomplexes (NCs). The NCs were further coated with human serum albumin to enhance serum stability, prolong blood circulation, and improve tumor targeting. Due to its multivalent topology, DPP exhibited stronger membrane activity yet lower cytotoxicity than its linear analogue (LPP), thus enabling efficient PKM2 silencing in MCF-7 cells in vitro (~75%) and in vivo (~70%). The PKM2 silencing inhibited tumor glycolysis  and further depleted the energy supply for HSPs production, thus overcoming the heat endurance of tumor cells to strengthen ICG-mediated photothermal ablation. Additionally, siPKM2-mediated energy depletion led to tumor cell starvation, which imparted synergistic anti-cancer effect with PTT. This study therefore provides a promising strategy for designing membrane-penetrating siRNA delivery materials, and it renders a unique RNAi-mediated anti- mechanism in sensitizing PTT and enabling starvation therapy.Copyright © 2019.

Whether the beneficial effects extend to those at lower risk remains unclear.We investigated the long-term CV effects of pioglitazone or sulfonylureas (SUs) across the spectrum of pretreatment CV risk.Among 2820 participants of the TOSCA.IT trial, four subgroups with different risk of outcome-a composite of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, urgent coronary revascularization-were identified by the RECursive Partitioning and AMalgamation (RECPAM) method. Within each group, the effect of SUs or pioglitazone on the outcome was evaluated.Sex was the first splitting variable, followed by urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) (>9 mg/g or ≤9 mg/g) and body mass index (BMI) (>28.7 or ≤28.7 kg/). Female patients had the lowest risk (reference); male patients with UACR >9 mg/g and BMI >28.7 kg/ had the highest risk [hazard ratio (HR), 5.58; 95% CI, 3.32 to 9.69]. Patients in this group present a cluster of conditions suggestive of marked insulin resistance (higher BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides, blood pressure, and UACR and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) than the other groups. Treatment with pioglitazone in this group was associated with a significantly lower occurrence of the outcome than SUs (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.76). No significant difference between study treatments was observed in the other RECPAM classes.It is possible to identify patients with type 2 diabetes early in the stage of their disease and who are largely free from evident CV disease in whom add-on pioglitazone to metformin confers CV protection as compared with SUs.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31203060>Sellar Xanthogranuloma: A Quest Based on Nine Cases Assessed with an Anterior Pituitary Provocation Test.</a></h2><p>Xanthogranuloma is a chronic inflammatory mass characterized by cholesterol crystal deposition, which is rarely seen in the sellar region. The objective of this study is to identify the clinical features and cause of sellar xanthogranulomas.We retrospectively analyzed manifestation, radiographic, and endocrinologic presentation in 9 patients (7 women and 2 men) whom we had previously treated.The patients were between 26 and 73 years of age (median, 56 years). The chief symptoms were visual symptoms in 3, polyuria in 3, headache in 4, and tiredness in 4 patients. Perimetry found visual field deficit in 6 patients. Anterior pituitary provocation tests disclosed impairment of ≥1 hormone in all patients: growth hormone in 8 patients and adrenocorticotropic hormone-cortisol axis in 8 patients. The lesions were suprasellar in 2 patients, intrasellar in 2 patients, and intrasuprasellar region in 5 patients. Three of the lesions were solid and 6 were single cystic to multicystic. Very low intensity area on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was observed in 4 lesions. Postcontrast study performed in 7 lesions showed enhancement in solid parts or cyst walls. Surgical decompression improved visual disturbance in half of the patients but rarely improved hormonal deficits. Follow-up (median, 47 months) found no recurrence of the lesion. In addition to these 9 cases, we found 2 xanthogranulomatous lesions pathologically associated with ciliated epithelia, which also presented with severe hypopituitarism.Xanthogranuloma seems to be the last stage of the chronic inflammation affecting Rathke cleft cyst or craniopharyngioma presenting with severe anterior pituitary insufficiency.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The Chinese live EIAV vaccine is attenuated from long-term passaging of a highly virulent strain  The parent pathogenic strain (EIAV) induces a host inflammatory storm to cause severe pathological injury of animals. However, the vaccine strain (EIAV) induces a high level of apoptosis to eliminate infected cells. To investigate how these processes are regulated, we performed a comparative proteomics analysis and functional study in equine monocyte-derived macrophages (eMDMs) and found that the divergent mitochondrial protein expression profiles caused by EIAV strains with different virulence led to disparate mitochondrial function, morphology, and . This in turn promoted the distinct transformation of macrophage inflammatory polarization and intrinsic apoptosis. In EIAV-infected cells, a high level of glycolysis and increased mitochondrial fragmentation were induced, resulting in the M1-polarized proinflammatory-type transformation of macrophages and the subsequent production of a strong inflammatory response. Following infection with EIAV, the infected cells were transformed into -polarized anti-inflammatory macrophages by inhibition of glycolysis. In this case, a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential and impairment of the electron transport chain led to increased levels of apoptosis and reactive oxygen species. These results correlated with viral pathogenicity loss and may help provide an understanding of the key mechanism of lentiviral attenuation. Following viral infection, the working pattern and function of the cell can be transformed through the impact on mitochondria. It still unknown how the mitochondrial response changes in cells infected with viruses in the process of virulence attenuation. EIAV is the only effective lentiviral vaccine for large-scale use in the world. EIAV is the parent pathogenic strain. Unlike EIAV-induced inflammation storms, EIAV can induce high levels of apoptosis. For the first time, we found that, after the mitochondrial protein expression profile is altered, EIAV-infected cells are transformed into M1-polarized-type macrophages and cause inflammatory injury and that the intrinsic apoptosis pathway is activated in EIAV-infected cells. These studies shed light on how the mitochondrial protein expression profile changes between cells infected by pathogenic lentivirus strains and cells infected by attenuated lentivirus strains to drive different cellular responses, especially from inflammation to apoptosis.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374571>Persistent low body weight in humans is associated with higher mitochondrial activity in white adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Constitutional thinness (CT) is a state of low but stable body weight (BMI ≤18 kg/). CT subjects have normal-range hormonal profiles and food intake but exhibit resistance to weight gain despite living in the modern world's obesogenic environment.The goal of this study is to identify molecular mechanisms underlying this protective phenotype against weight gain.We conducted a clinical overfeeding study on 30 CT subjects and 30 controls (BMI 20-25 kg/) matched for age and sex. We performed clinical and integrative molecular and transcriptomic analyses on white adipose and muscle tissues.Our results demonstrate that adipocytes were markedly smaller in CT individuals (mean ± SEM: 2174 ± 142 μm 2) compared with controls (3586 ± 216 μ) (P < 0.01). The mitochondrial respiratory capacity was higher in CT adipose tissue, particularly at the level of complex II of the electron transport chain (2.2-fold increase; P < 0.01). This higher activity was paralleled by an increase in mitochondrial number (CT compared with control: 784 ± 27 compared with 675 ± 30 mitochondrial DNA molecules per cell; P < 0.05). No evidence for uncoupled respiration or "browning" of the white adipose tissue was found. In accordance with the mitochondrial differences, CT subjects had a distinct adipose transcriptomic profile [62 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate of 0.1 and log fold change >0.75)], with many differentially expressed genes associating with positive  outcomes. Pathway analyses revealed an increase in fatty acid oxidation ( P = 3 × 10-04) but also triglyceride biosynthesis (P = 3.6 × 10-04). No differential response to the overfeeding was observed in the 2 groups.The distinct molecular signature of the adipose tissue in CT individuals suggests the presence of augm ented futile lipid cycling, rather than mitochondrial uncoupling, as a way to increase energy expenditure in CT individuals. We propose that increased mitochondrial function in adipose tissue is an important mediator in sustaining the low body weight in CT individuals.

However, prior studies included limited cancer deaths and had inconsistent findings. Therefore, we evaluated insulin resistance and cancer-specific and all-cause mortality in postmenopausal women participating in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI).Eligible were a subsample of 22 837 WHI participants aged 50-79 years enrolled at 40 US clinical centers from 1993 to 1998 who had baseline fasting glucose and insulin levels. Baseline insulin resistance was measured by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Cancers were verified by central medical record review and deaths verified by medical record and death certificate review enhanced by National Death Index queries. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. All statistical tests were two-sided.During a median of 18.9 years of follow-up, 1820 cancer deaths and 7415 total deaths occurred. Higher HOMA-IR quartile was associated with higher cancer-specific mortality (Q4 vs Q1, HR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.47; Ptrend = .003) and all-cause mortality (Q4 vs Q1, HR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.51 to 1.76; Ptrend < .001). A sensitivity analysis for diabetes status did not change findings. Among women with body mass index less than 25 kg/, higher HOMA-IR quartile was associated with higher cancer mortality (Fine and Gray, P = .004).High insulin resistance, as measured by HOMA-IR, identifies postmenopausal women at higher risk for cancer-specific and all-cause mortality who could potentially benefit from early intervention.© The Author(s) 2019.

Evidence shows that functional nanodrugs can regulate macrophage polarization and promote anti-inflammatory cytokine expression, which is feasible in SCI immunotherapeutic treatments. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS) nanomaterials have garnered great attention as potential carriers for therapeutic payload. Herein, we synthesize MoS@PEG (MoS = molybdenum disulfide, PEG = poly (ethylene glycol)) nanoflowers as an effective carrier for loading etanercept (ET) to treat SCI. We characterize drug loading and release properties of MoS@PEG in vitro and demonstrate that ET-loading MoS@PEG obviously inhibits the expression of M1-related pro-inflammatory markers (TNF-α, CD86 and iNOS), while promoting -related anti-inflammatory markers (Agr1, CD206 and IL-10) levels. In vivo, the mouse model of SCI shows that long-circulating ET-MoS@PEG nanodrugs can effectively extravasate into the injured spinal cord up to 96 h after SCI, and promote macrophages towards  type polarization. As a result, the ET-loading MoS@PEG administration in mice can protect survival motor neurons, thus, reducing injured areas at central lesion sites, and significantly improving locomotor recovery. This study demonstrates the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities of ET-MoS@PEG and promising utility of MoS nanomaterial-mediated drug delivery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report that machilin A (MA), which acts as a competitive inhibitor by blocking the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) binding site of LDHA, suppresses growth of cancer cells and lactate production in various cancer cell types, including colon, breast, lung, and liver cancers. Furthermore, MA markedly decreased LDHA activity, lactate production, and intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels induced by hypoxia-induced LDHA expression in cancer cells, and significantly inhibited colony formation, leading to reduced cancer cell survival. In mouse models inoculated with murine Lewis lung carcinoma, MA significantly suppressed tumor growth as observed by a reduction of tumor volume and weight; resulting from the inhibition of LDHA activity. Subsequently, the suppression of tumor-derived lactic acid in MA-treated cancer cells resulted in decrease of neovascularization through the regulation of alternatively activated macrophages () polarization in macrophages. Taken together, we suggest that the reduction of lactate by MA in cancer cells directly results in a suppression of cancer cell growth. Furthermore, macrophage polarization and activation of endothelial cells for angiogenesis were indirectly regulated preventing lactate production in MA-treated cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31119318> remodeling contributes towards an immune-suppressive phenotype in glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive tumors.

Recent research has demonstrated that  reprogramming in a tumor can contribute towards immune tolerance. To begin to understand the interface between  remodeling and the immune-suppressive state in GBM, we performed a focused, integrative analysis coupling metabolomics with gene-expression profiling in patient-derived GBM (n = 80) and compared them to low-grade astrocytoma (LGA; n = 28).  intermediates of tryptophan, arginine, prostaglandin, and adenosine emerged as immuno- nodes in GBM specific to the mesenchymal and classical molecular subtypes of GBM. Integrative analyses emphasized the importance of downstream  of several of these   in GBM. Using CIBERSORT to analyze immune components from the transcriptional profiles of individual tumors, we demonstrated that tryptophan and adenosine  resulted in an accumulation of Tregs and  macrophages, respectively, and was recapitulated in mouse models. Furthermore, we extended these findings to preclinical models to determine their potential utility in defining the biologic and/or immunologic consequences of the identified  programs.

However, treatment modalities targeting ATMs remain limited. The effects of lycopene, an antioxidant carotenoid compound, on adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance in high fat (HF)-diet-induced obese mice are examined.C57BL/6J mice are fed an HF diet or an HF diet containing lycopene (HF+LY) for 8 weeks. Lycopene attenuates HF-diet-induced glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia. Compared with HF mice, HF+LY mice exhibit attenuated adipocyte hypertrophy and macrophage infiltration in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Flow cytometry analysis of ATMs demonstrates that lycopene attenuated the increased number of ATMs in HF diet-fed mice. In addition, HF+LY mice have 23% fewer M1-polarized ATMs and 60% more -polarized ATMs than HF mice, resulting in the predominance of  over M1 in the ATM population. -dominant polarization is also seen in hepatic macrophages in HF+LY mice. Moreover, lycopene promotes IL-4-induced  polarization by increasing the phosphorylation levels of STAT6 and Akt in Raw 264.7 macrophages.Lycopene facilitates -dominant polarization in ATM, thereby attenuating HF diet-induced inflammation and insulin resistance in eWAT and the liver.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, associations between early stages of renal impairment and physical outcomes are unclear.The Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project is a prospective study of 1,705 community-dwelling men aged 70 years and older. Participants with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) more than 30 mL/min/1.73  were included and further divided into four eGFR categories. Physical parameters including grip strength, gait speed, appendicular lean mass (ALM, a sum of skeletal mass of arms and legs), ALM adjusted for body mass index (ALMBMI), and muscle function (measured using grip strength divided by arm lean mass) were assessed at both baseline and 5-year follow-up. Associations between kidney function and changes in physical parameters were analyzed using linear and logistic regression models.Our study included 789 men with a median age of 75 years and median eGFR of 72 mL/min/1.73  at baseline. Over 5 years, grip strength, gait speed, ALMBMI, and muscle function all declined in the whole cohort, compared with baseline. The multivariable analyses showed that poorer renal function was associated with more rapid declines in grip strength, gait speed, and muscle function in participants with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (GFR category stage G3, eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 ) (p = .01, p < .01, p = .02, respectively) but less so in those with eGFR more than 60 mL/min/1.73 , whereas eGFR category did not have a significant impact on declines in ALMBMI. These results remained unchanged with or without adjustment for age.In community-dwelling older men, mild-to-moderate renal impairment at baseline was associated with declines in grip strength, gait speed, and muscle function over time despite preservation of muscle mass.© The Author(s) 2019.

Naïve macrophages have two major potential fates: polarization to (1) the classical pro-inflammatory M1 defense response to bacterial pathogens and tumor cells, and (2) the alternatively activated  response, induced in the presence of parasites and wounding, and also implicated in the development of tumor-associated macrophages. ODC, the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis, leads to an increase in putrescine levels, which impairs M1 gene transcription.

Weight, height, waist circumference, body fat percentage and blood pressure were measured; serum glucose, creatinine, urea, ureic nitrogen, total cholesterol, low (LDLc) and high (HDLc) density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides and glycosylated hemoglobin A1C in whole blood were determined; the presence of proteinuria was determined in partial urine. The eGFR was estimated by equations and the body mass index (BMI) was calculated.The frequency of MS was significantly higher among patients with CKD (eGFR < 60 mL/min/), mildly reduced eGFR (60-89 mL/min/), hyperfiltration or proteinuria. The risks of mildly reduced eGFR and protenuria were significantly associated with elevated fasting blood glucose, low HDLc and MS, with and without adjustment for sex, age and BMI. When adjusted for the diabetic condition, only the risk of proteinuria remained associated with MS and elevated blood pressure.

During the development of heart failure, adaptive intracellular  processes that evolve prior to macro-anatomic remodelling, could provide an early signal of impending failure. We hypothesized that  imaging with hyperpolarized magnetic resonance would detect the early development of heart failure before conventional echocardiography could reveal cardiac dysfunction.Five 8.5 kg piglets were subjected to pulmonary banding and subsequently examined by [1-13C]pyruvate hyperpolarization, conventional magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, and blood testing, every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. They were compared with a weight matched, healthy control group. Conductance catheter examination at the end of the study showed impaired right ventricular systolic function along with compromised left ventricular diastolic function. After 16 weeks, we saw a significant decrease in the conversion ratio of pyruvate/bicarbonate in the left ventricle from 0.13 (0.04) in controls to 0.07 (0.02) in animals with pulmonary banding, along with a significant increase in the lactate/bicarbonate ratio to 3.47 (1.57) compared with 1.34 (0.81) in controls. N-terminal pro-hormone of brain natriuretic peptide was increased by more than 300%, while cardiac index was reduced to 2.8 (0.95) L/min/ compared with 3.9 (0.95) in controls. Echocardiography revealed no changes.Hyperpolarization detected a shift towards anaerobic  in early stages of right ventricular dysfunction, as evident by an increased lactate/bicarbonate ratio. Dysfunction was confirmed with conductance catheter assessment, but could not be detected by echocardiography.

Several oncogenic factors help in promoting this consequence including, pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) a rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis in tumor  via exhibiting its low pyruvate kinase activity and nuclear moon-lightening functions to increase the synthesis of lactate and macromolecules for tumor proliferation. Not only its role in cancer cells but also its role in the tumor microenvironment cells has to be understood for developing the small molecules against it which is lacking with the literature till date. Therefore, in this present review, the role of PKM2 with respect to various tumor niche cells will be clarified.

The 24-h energy intake was calculated based on the food consumed for breakfast, followed by an ad libitum lunch, snacks, and dinner. Indirect calorimetry with heart-rate accelerometry was used to measure substrate utilization and 24-h energy expenditure. A [6,6-2H2]glucose infusion was used to investigate tissue-specific carbohydrate utilization.The 24-h energy balance was -400 kcal (normalized 95% CI: -230, -571 kcal) for the FE trial; this was significantly lower than both the BR trial (492 kcal; normalized 95% CI: 332, 652 kcal) and the BE trial (7 kcal; normalized 95% CI: -153, 177 kcal; both P < 0.01 compared with FE).

Body weight, epididymal fat and liver weight, glucose, lipid, insulin, and histologic characteristics were evaluated to determine the effect of PF on insulin resistance by analyzing the proportion of macrophages in epididymal fat and liver and measured inflammatory gene expression. PF administration significantly decreased the fasting and postprandial glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, total-cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The epididymal fat tissue and liver showed a significant decrease of fat accumulation in histological analysis. PF significantly reduced the number of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs), F4/80 Kupffer cells, and CD68 Kupffer cells, increased the proportion of  phenotype macrophages, and decreased the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines. These results suggest that PF could be used to improve insulin resistance through modulation of macrophage-mediated inflammation and enhance glucose and lipid .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116758>Relationship between DXA measured metrics of adiposity and glucose homeostasis; An analysis of the NHANES data.</a></h2><p>Obesity is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a means of determining body composition and body fat distribution at different sites including whole body and trunk-locations where there tends to be high correlation at an individual level.We performed an analysis of DXA-derived metrics of adiposity (truncal fat %,subtotal fat % and total fat %) from the NHANES database and then correlated the findings with markers of insulin resistance. We analyzed the data from DXA scans in NHANES 1999-2004. Homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance and HOMA-β (beta-cell function) were estimated. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated (ρ) between HOMA-IR,HOMA-β and different measures of obesity (Waist circumference(in cm), Body Mass Index (kg/), truncal fat %, subtotal fat % as well as total fat %) to gauge the relationship between markers of glucose homeostasis and DXA derived metrics of obesity. We also performed logarithmic transformation of HOMA-IR as well as HOMA-β to ensure normality of distribution and to meet the criteria for regression analysis. A forward selection model (by outcome and gender) was performed to predict log transformed insulin resistance (log HOMA-IR) as well as log transformed HOMA-β (log HOMA-β,measure of beta cell function) from age, serum triglycerides, HDL, trunk fat % and the SBP (in both males and females separately), after reviewing the spearman correlation coefficients.There were a total of 6147 men and 6369 women who were part of the study cohort. There was a positive correlation between markers of adiposity and log HOMA-IR and log HOMA-β in both males and females.Truncal fat % had the highest nonparametric correlation coefficent with log HOMA-IR among the DXA derived fat% (0.54 in males and 048 in females). In the multivariate analysis, truncal fat % was an independent predictor of logHOMA-IR as well as logHOMA-β. In males, the significant predictors of log HOMA-IR were; age, truncal fat % and HDL cholesterol (Adjusted R square of 0.325 (±0.66), F(3,207) = 34.63, p < .01). In females, the significant predictors of log HOMA-IR were; age, truncal fat %, SBP, Serum triglyceride and HDL cholesterol (Adjusted R square of 0.307 (±0.65),F(5,198) = 18.9, p < .01). In both males and females, the significant predictors of log HOMA-β were; age, and truncal fat % (Males; adjusted R square of 0.25 (±0.63), F (2,208) = 36.4, p < .01, Females; adjusted R square of 0.27 (±0.62), F (2,201) = 38.4, p < .01).Body fat % on DXA is an imaging biomarker for insulin resistance. Incorporating this important information into DXA acquisitions and reporting frameworks may allow for this information to be available to providers who refer patients for these imaging studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250762>Prevalence and Risk Factors for Diabetes Mellitus in a State in South East Nigeria: Results of a Population Based House To House Survey.</a></h2><p>Population based studies on diabetes mellitus (DM) are scarce in Nigeria..This was a population-based house to house survey aimed at determining the prevalence of DM and assessing the risk factors associated with DM in a state in South east Nigeria Methods: This was a cross-sectional observational study in which 1680 adults were recruited using a multistage sampling method to randomly select not more than two suitable participants of both sex in each household from four enumeration areas (EAs) in each local government area (LGA) and the three senatorial zones in the state.

Through their constant development, even natural components like hyaluronic acid (HY) have been added to improve both their handling and also their regenerative properties. However, little knowledge exists regarding the consequences of the addition of HY to their biocompatibility and the inflammatory tissue reactions. Thus, the present study was conducted, aiming to analyze the influence of two different amounts of high molecular weight HY (HMWHY), combined with a BBS, on in vitro biocompatibility and in vivo tissue reaction. Established in vitro procedures, using L929 cells, were used for cytocompatibility analyses under the test conditions of DIN EN:ISO 10993-5. For the in vivo part of the study, calvarial defects were created in 20 Wistar rats and subsequently filled with BBS, and BBS combined with two different HMWHY amounts, i.e., BBS + HY(L) and BBS + HY(H). As controls, empty defects were used. Established histological, immunohistochemical, and histomorphometrical methods were applied to analyze the tissue reactions to the three different materials, including the induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages and multinucleated giant cells (BMGCs). The in vitro results showed that none of the materials or compositions caused biological damage to the L929 cells and can be considered to be non-toxic. The in vivo results showed that only the addition of high doses of HY to a biphasic bone substitute significantly decreases the occurrence of pro-inflammatory macrophages (*  < 0.05), comparable to the numbers found in the control group, while no significant differences within the three study groups for -macrophages nor BMGCs were detected. In conclusion, the addition of different amounts of HMWHY does not seem to affect the inflammation response to BBS, while improving the material handling properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141164>NAMPT regulates PKM2 nuclear location through 14-3-3ζ: Conferring resistance to tamoxifen in breast cancer.</a></h2><p>The resistance against tamoxifen therapy has become one of the major obstacles in the clinical treatment of breast cancer. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is an essential enzyme catalyzing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide biosynthesis and is important for tumor . The study here sought to explore the effect of NAMPT on breast cancer survival with tamoxifen conditioning. We found that NAMPT was highly expressed in breast cancer cells compared with normal mammary epithelial cells. Inhibition of NAMPT by FK866 inhibited cell viability and aggravated apoptosis in cancer cells treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen. NAMPT overexpression upregulated 14-3-3ζ expression. Knockdown of 14-3-3ζ reduced cell survival and promoted apoptosis. Activation of Akt signaling, rather than ERK1/2 pathway, is responsible for 14-3-3ζ regulation by NAMPT overexpression. Furthermore, NAMPT overexpression led to PKM2 accumulation in the cell nucleus and could be dampened by 14-3-3ζ inhibition. In addition, NAMPT overexpression promoted xenografted tumor growth and apoptosis in nude mice, while 14-3-3ζ inhibition attenuated its effect. Collectively, our data demonstrate that NAMPT contributes to tamoxifen resistance through regulation of 14-3-3ζ expression and PKM2 translocation.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565219>Uterine glycolytic enzyme expression is affected by knockout of different estrogen receptor subtypes.</a></h2><p>The estrogen signaling pathway via nuclear estrogen receptors (ER) α and β is considered to be the master regulator of the cellular glucose metabolism in the uterus. While  animal studies have demonstrated that 17β-estradiol (E2) treatment increases the expression levels and activities of several glycolytic enzymes in the uterus, the specific ER subtype-dependent regulation of key glycolytic enzymes in the uterus has not been experimentally verified. In this study, the localization of ERα and ERβ in human and mouse endometria were evaluated using immunohistology. Given that ERα and ERβ are not functionally equivalent, ERα, ERβ and ERαβ knockout (ERα, ERβ and ERαβ) mice were utilized to determine the expression pattern of glycolytic enzymes in the uterus. It was found that the level of ERα was higher than that of ERβ in the human and mouse endometrial epithelial and stromal cells, and both receptors were downregulated by E2 treatment in the mouse uterus. The expression of the hexokinase 1 and GAPDH was increased in ERα and ERβ mice compared with wild-type controls. Increased phosphofructokinase expression was observed in ERα and ERαβ mice, whereas increased pyruvate kinase isozyme  and pyruvate dehydrogenase expression was observed in ERβ and ERαβ mice. The findings indicated for the first time that while estrogen regulates ERα and ERβ expression in the uterus, ERα and ERβ selectively regulate uterine glycolytic enzyme expression during glycolysis. Additionally, the link between endometrial ER subtypes and glycolysis in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is discussed. The findings suggested that the E2-dependent ER-mediated regulation of glycolysis may be involved in the disturbance of the glucose metabolism in patients with PCOS with endometrial dysfunction.Copyright: © Hu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31437775>Characterization and analysis of estrogenic cyclic phenone metabolites produced in vitro by rainbow trout liver slices using GC-MS, LC-MS and LC-TOF-MS.</a></h2><p>Cyclic phenones are chemicals of interest to the USEPA and international organizations due to their potential for endocrine disruption to aquatic and terrestrial species. The  conversion of cyclic phenones by liver hepatocytes and the structure of main metabolites yielded have not been assessed in fish species. As part of a larger project, in this study we investigated the structure of metabolites produced in vitro by rainbow trout (rt) liver slices after exposure to the model cyclic phenones benzophenone (DPK), cyclobutyl phenyl ketone (CBP) and cyclohexyl phenyl ketone (CPK). While only one distinct metabolite was detected for DPK and CBP (benzhydrol and CBPOH, respectively), CPK yielded nine positional isomers (M1-M9) as products. In absence of standards, improved inference of CPK metabolites tentative structures was achieved by combining GC-MS with and without derivatization, LC with tandem MS, LC with high resolution time of flight (TOF) MS and LC fractionation data with CPK phase II conjugative  information. Data supported that CPK is metabolized by phase I oxidation of the cyclohexyl ring and not the phenyl group as predicted by  simulators. CPK metabolites M1 and  (MW 186), were proposed to be cyclohexenyl-derivatives. Also, M6-M9 were proposed to be hydroxylated metabolites (MW 204), with the potential for undergoing phase II conjugative  to glucuronides and sulfates. Finally, M3, M4 and M5 were proposed as cyclohexanone-derivatives of CPK (MW 202), resulting from the limited redox-interconversion of their hydroxylated pairs M8, M6 and M7, respectively. Assessment of metabolite role in biological responses associated with endocrine disruption will advance the development of methods for species extrapolation and the understanding of differential sensitivity of species to chemical exposure.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208912>Extracellular Vesicles from Albumin-Induced Tubular Epithelial Cells Promote the M1 Macrophage Phenotype by Targeting Klotho.</a></h2><p>Albumin absorbed by renal tubular epithelial cells induces inflammation and plays a key role in promoting diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression. Macrophages are prominent inflammatory cells in the kidney, and their role there is dependent on their phenotypes. However, whether albuminuria influences macrophage phenotypes and underlying mechanisms during the development of DKD is still unclear. We found that M1 macrophage-related markers were increased in diabetes mellitus (DM) mouse renal tissues with the development of DKD, and coculture of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from human serum albumin (HSA)-induced HK-2 cells with macrophages induced macrophage M1 polarization in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Through a bioinformatic analysis, miR-199a-5p was selected and found to be increased in EVs from HSA-induced HK-2 cells and in urinary EVs from DM patients with macroalbuminuria. Tail-vein injection of DM mice with EVs from HSA-induced HK-2 cells induced kidney macrophage M1 polarization and accelerated the progression of DKD through miR-199a-5p. miR-199a-5p exerted its effect by targeting Klotho, and Klotho induced macrophage  polarization through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway both in vivo and in vitro. In summary, miR-199a-5p from HSA-stimulated HK-2 cell-derived EVs induces M1 polarization by targeting the Klotho/TLR4 pathway and further accelerates the progression of DKD.Copyright © 2019 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

In this study, we biochemically and histologically characterized the effects of rh-HGF on in vitro human hepatocyte injury and mouse acute liver failure (ALF) models, both of which were induced by antibody-mediated Fas signaling. rh-HGF inhibited intracellular caspase-3/7 activation and cytokeratin 18 (CK-18) fragment release in both models. Histologically, rh-HGF dramatically suppressed parenchymal damage and intrahepatic hemorrhage. Among the laboratory parameters, prothrombin time (PT) was strongly preserved by rh-HGF, and PT was well correlated with the degree of intrahepatic hemorrhage. These results showed that the anti-apoptotic effect of rh-HGF on hepatocytes coincided strikingly with the suppression of intrahepatic hemorrhage. PT was considered to be the best parameter that correlated with the intrahepatic hemorrhages associated with hepatocellular damage. The action of rh-HGF might derive not only from its anti-apoptosis effects on liver parenchymal cells but also from its stabilization of structural and vasculature integrity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309760>[Roles of macrophages in formation and progression of intracranial aneurysms].</a></h2><p>Studies have shown that chronic inflammatory response plays a key role in intracranial aneurysms (IA) formation and progression, and macrophages regulate the formation and progression of IA through a variety of .

It has been suggested that weight loss may affect SCFA , but a systematic review of intervention studies is lacking. We aimed to systematically assess the effects of dietary, physical activity-based, and surgical weight-loss interventions among overweight [body mass index (BMI) 25-29.9 kg/)] or obese (BMI ≥30 kg/) adults (≥18 y) on concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate, and total SCFAs in blood, urine, or feces. We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to April 30, 2018 for randomized and nonrandomized weight-loss trials among overweight or obese adults, in which the concentrations of individual and total SCFAs were assessed. A total of 9 studies consisting of 2 randomized parallel-arm trials, 4 crossover trials, and 3 nonrandomized clinical or surgical trials were included. In the majority of studies, changes in fecal SCFA concentrations were assessed, whereas changes in serum SCFAs were reported from 1 trial. Individual and total SCFA concentrations either remained unchanged or decreased significantly following weight loss. Three of the dietary interventions that resulted in decreased SCFA concentrations were low (≤5% of energy) in total carbohydrates. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias. Decreases in SCFA concentrations may accompany weight loss induced by bariatric surgery or dietary restriction among overweight or obese adults, particularly when carbohydrate intake is reduced. However, findings were inconsistent and based on studies with high to unclear risk of bias, and small sample sizes. Because measurements of fecal SCFAs may not be ideal due to limited sample standardization, well-powered trials with repeated blood measurements of SCFAs are required.

The use of rhizobacterial strains underlines the main hypothesis of the present research that have been exploited in order to alleviate the Cd induced stress in plants and promoting their growth sidewise. The morphological parameters, plant pigments, and gaseous exchange parameters were estimated and found to be reduced in plants due to Cd toxicity. Along with this, the levels of phenolic compounds and osmoprotectants were stimulated in plants raised in Cd spiked soils. In addition, free amino acid content was reduced in plants under Cd treatment. It was revealed that these bacterial strains  (M1) and  () when inoculated to tomato plants improved the morphological characteristics and enhanced photosynthetic attributes. Moreover, the level of phenolic compounds and osmoprotectants were further enhanced by both the inoculating agents independently. However, in situ localization studies of phenol accumulation in root sections was found to be enhanced in Cd treated plants as revealed through higher intensity of yellowish-brown colour. The supplementation of bacterial strains further accumulated the phenols in Cd stressed root sections as evidenced through increased colour intensity. Therefore, the present study suggested that bacterial strains mitigates Cd stress from tomato plants through improving morphological, physiological and metabolite profiles.

A high eating rate contributes to overeating and potentially to weight gain. Previous studies showed that an augmented fork that delivers real-time feedback on eating rate is a potentially effective intervention to decrease eating rate in naturalistic settings. This study assessed the impact of using the augmented fork during a 15-week period on eating rate and body weight.In a parallel randomized controlled trial, 141 participants with overweight (age: 49.2 ± 12.3 y; BMI: 31.5 ± 4.48 kg/) were randomized to intervention groups (VFC, n = 51 or VFC+, n = 44) or control group (NFC, n = 46). First, we measured bite rate and success ratio on five consecutive days with the augmented fork without feedback (T1). The intervention groups (VFC, VFC+) then used the same fork, but now received vibrotactile feedback when they ate more than one bite per 10 s. Participants in VFC+ had additional access to a web portal with visual feedback. In the control group (NFC), participants ate with the fork without either feedback. The intervention period lasted four weeks, followed by a week of measurements only (T2) and another measurement week after eight weeks (T3). Body weight was assessed at T1, T2, and T3.Participants in VFC and VFC+ had a lower bite rate (p < .01) and higher success ratio (p < .0001) than those in NFC at T2. This effect persisted at T3. In both intervention groups participants lost more weight than those in the control group at T2 (p < .02), with no rebound at T3.The findings of this study indicate that an augmented fork with vibrotactile feedback is a viable tool to reduce eating rate in naturalistic settings. Further investigation may confirm that the augmented fork could support long-term weight loss strategies.The research reported in this manuscript was registered on 4 November 2015 in the Netherlands Trial Register with number NL5432 ( https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/5432 ).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601915>Dysregulated liver lipid  and innate immunity associated with hepatic steatosis in neonatal BBdp rats and NOD mice.</a></h2><p>In a previous study we reported that prediabetic rats have a unique gene signature that was apparent even in neonates.

In the present study we investigated further early changes in hepatic innate immunity and  in two models of type 1 diabetes (T1D), the BBdp rat and NOD mouse. There was a striking increase in lipid deposits in liver, particularly in neonatal BBdp rats, with a less striking but significant increase in neonatal NOD mice in association with dysregulated expression of lipid  genes. This was associated with a decreased number of extramedullary hematopoietic clusters as well as CD68 macrophages in the liver of both models. In addition, PPARɣ and phosphorylated AMPKα protein were decreased in neonatal BBdp rats. BBdp rats displayed decreased expression of antimicrobial genes in neonates and decreased  genes at 30 days.

Metabolite profiling offers an opportunity to systematically discover new predictors for weight gain that are relatively easy to measure compared to traditional approaches.Using baseline metabolite profiling data of middle-aged individuals from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS; n = 1,508), we identified 42 metabolites associated (p < 0.05) with longitudinal change in body mass index (BMI). We performed stepwise linear regression to select 8 of these metabolites to build a metabolite risk score (MRS) for predicting future weight gain. We replicated the MRS using data from the Mexico City Diabetes Study (MCDS; n = 768), in which one standard deviation increase in the MRS corresponded to ~0.03 increase in BMI (kg/) per year (i.e. ~0.09 kg/year for a 1.7 m adult). We observed that none of the available anthropometric, lifestyle, and glycemic variables fully account for the MRS prediction of weight gain. Surprisingly, we found the MRS to be strongly correlated with baseline insulin sensitivity in both cohorts and to be negatively predictive of T2D in MCDS. Genome-wide association study of the MRS identified 2 genome-wide (p < 5 × 10-8) and 5 suggestively (p < 1 × 10-6) significant loci, several of which have been previously linked to obesity-related phenotypes.We have constructed and validated a generalizable MRS for future weight gain that is an independent predictor distinct from several other known risk factors. The MRS captures a composite biological picture of weight gain, perhaps hinting at the anabolic effects of preserved insulin sensitivity.

Patients whose AMA and/or AMA- first- tested as positive were recorded. Complications were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases.  A total of 1323 AMA positive cases were discovered for the first time. Among them, 78.0% were women, and the age of initial diagnosis was 56.8 ± 16.0 years. The first three initially diagnosed departments were rheumatology and immunology (37.4%), liver Disease (15.9%) and hematology (15.9%) relevant to musculoskeletal and connective tissue diseases (45.2%), hematology and hematopoietic organs and immune diseases (30.6%) and circulatory system diseases (29.7%). There were 297 newly confirmed cases of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC); accounting for 89.2% of women, and the age of initial diagnosis was 60.1 ± 12.4 years. The top three departments of initially diagnosed as PBC were liver disease (37.7%), rheumatology (33.0%) and gastroenterology (15.2%), of which 39.7% had musculoskeletal and connective tissue diseases, 27.9% had circulatory diseases, and 24.9 % were combined with endocrine and  diseases.  Besides PBC and other autoimmune diseases, AMA and / or AMA- positivity can be observed in a variety of diseases in several clinical departments, and its clinical significance remains to be further clarified.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191323>Role of Myeloid-Epithelial-Reproductive Tyrosine Kinase and Macrophage Polarization in the Progression of Atherosclerotic Lesions Associated With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Recent lines of evidence highlight the involvement of myeloid-epithelial-reproductive tyrosine kinase (MerTK) in  disease associated with liver damage. MerTK is mainly expressed in anti-inflammatory  macrophages where it mediates transcriptional changes including suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancement of inflammatory repressors. MerTK is regulated by   through nuclear sensors including LXRs, PPARs, and RXRs, in response to apoptotic bodies or to other sources of cholesterol. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. It is a clinicopathological syndrome closely related to obesity, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. It includes a spectrum of conditions ranging from simple steatosis, characterized by hepatic fat accumulation with or without inflammation, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), defined by hepatic fat deposition with hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and accumulating fibrosis. Several studies support an association between NAFLD and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, a major cause of death worldwide. This pathological condition consists in a chronic and progressive inflammatory process in the intimal layer of large- and medium-sized arteries. The complications of advanced atherosclerosis include chronic or acute ischemic damage in the tissue perfused by the affected artery, leading to cellular death. By identifying specific targets influencing lipid  and cardiovascular-related diseases, the present review highlights the role of MerTK in NAFLD-associated atherosclerotic lesions as a potential innovative therapeutic target. Therapeutic advantages might derive from the use of compounds selective for nuclear receptors targeting PPARs rather than LXRs regulating macrophage lipid  and macrophage mediated inflammation, by favoring the expression of MerTK, which mediates an immunoregulatory action with a reduction in inflammation and in atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462699>Intestinal epithelial PKM2 serves as a safeguard against experimental colitis via activating β-catenin signaling.</a></h2><p>The pyruvate kinase  (PKM2)-mediated aerobic glycolysis has been shown to play a critical role in promoting cell survival and proliferation. However, little is known about the function of intestinal epithelial PKM2 in intestine homeostasis. Here we investigate whether and how intestinal epithelial PKM2 modulates the morphology and function of the adult intestine in experimental colitis. Analyzing colonoscopic biopsies from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients, we found significantly decreased level of intestinal epithelial PKM2 in patients compared to that in non-inflamed tissues. Similar reduction of intestinal epithelial PKM2 was observed in mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Moreover, intestinal epithelial-specific PKM2-knockout (Pkm2) mice displayed more severe intestinal inflammation, as evidenced by a shortened colon, disruption of epithelial tight junctions, an increase in inflammatory cytokine levels, and immune cell infiltration, when compared to wild-type mice. Gene profiling, western blot, and function analyses indicated that cell survival signals, particularly the Wnt/β-catenin , were associated with PKM2 activity. Increasing mouse intestinal epithelial PKM2 expression via delivery of a PKM2-expressing plasmid attenuated experimental colitis. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that intestinal epithelial PKM2 increases cell survival and wound healing under the colitic condition via activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31482976>Validation of the two-minute step test in obese with comorbibities and morbidly obese patients.</a></h2><p>Cardiopulmonary fitness assessment is a valuable resource to obtain quantitative indicators of an individual's physical performance. The cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX), considered the gold standard test for this evaluation, is costly and difficult to be accessed by the general population. In order to make this evaluation more accessible, and to better reflect the performance of daily life activities, alternative tests were proposed. Morbidly obese patients present limitations that impair physical performance assessment and could benefit from a test of shorter duration, provided it is validated. This observational study aimed to validate the two-minute step test (2MST) as a tool to evaluate functional capacity (FC) in obese with comorbidities and morbidly obese patients, compared the 2MST with CPX as a measure of physical performance, and developed a predictive equation to estimate peak oxygen uptake (VO2) in the 2MST. The CPX and the 2MST were performed and  and ventilatory parameters were recorded in 31 obese individuals (BMI>35 kg/). Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the peak VO2 best predictors. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to assess the agreement between the two methods. Peak VO2 measured by CPX and 2MST showed a strong correlation (r=0.70, P<0.001) and there was a moderate correlation between peak VO2 of the 2MST and the number of up-and-down step cycles (UDS) (r=0.55; P=0.01). The reference equation obtained was: VO2 (mL·kg-1·min-1) = 13.341 + 0.138 × total UDS - (0.183 × BMI), with an estimated standard error of 1.3 mL·kg-1·min-1. The 2MST is a viable, practical, and easily accessible test for FC. UDS and BMI can predict peak VO2 satisfactorily.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574574>Adzuki Bean Water Extract Attenuates Obesity by Modulating /M1 Macrophage Polarization and Gut Microbiota Composition.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a chronic condition resulting in excessive fat accumulation in adipose tissues. Adipose tissue is now considered as an immune organ, at the crossroads between metabolism and immunity. Thus, this study investigates the effects of adzuki beans on obesity and gut microbiota in high fat diet-induced mice.In this study, adzuki bean hot water extract (AWE) is determined to have the most significant anti-adipogenic effect; it is able to inhibit lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and reduces body weight and adipose tissue weight in a dose-dependent manner. AWE treatment also decreases M1-polarized adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) while inducing -polarized ATMs. The number and size of fat vacuoles in liver lesions are significantly reduced, indicating that AWE could ameliorate steatosis in high fat diet-induced mice. The results also demonstrate that AWE-treated groups inhibit  via activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and reduce peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins α expression. Moreover, the studies confirm that AWE decreases obesity through modulating gut microbiota.The results demonstrate that AWE supplementation ameliorates high fat diet-induced obesity and gut microbiota composition and suggests that AWE may have the potential to be developed into a functional food to improve metabolic disorders.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

His experiments were conducted in the presence of excess oxygen, but today tumor tissue is known to be a hypoxic environment. However, an increase of glycolysis and lactate production is still a valid observation. Numerous abnormalities and mutations of  enzymes have been found in many cancers. For example, pyruvate kinase  has been associated with many cancers and is a major contributor to directing glycolysis into fermentation, forming lactate. Increases in several enzymes, including glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase , Rad6, or deficiency of other enzymes such as succinate dehydrogenase, all may contribute directly or indirectly to increases in lactate associated with the Warburg effect. In addition, the increased lactate and acid-base changes are modified further by monocarboxylate transporters and carbonic anhydrase, which contribute to alkalinizing tumor cells while acidifying the tumor extracellular environment. This acidification leads to cancer spread. Fully understanding the mechanisms underlying the Warburg effect should provide new approaches to cancer treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

During aging, chronic inflammation increases proportional to visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass and associates with escalating morbidity and mortality. Here, we utilize a mouse model to investigate the inflammatory status of visceral adipose tissue in lean aging mice and assess the effects of exercise training interventions. We randomized adult (11 months; n = 21) and old (23 months; n = 27) mice to resistance training (RT) or endurance training (ET), or to a sedentary control group (S). Strikingly, we observed an anti-inflammatory phenotype in the old mice, consisting of higher accumulation of  macrophages and IL-10 expression, compared to the adult mice. In concordance, old mice also had less VAT mass and smaller adipocytes compared to adult mice. In both age groups, exercise training enhanced the anti-inflammatory phenotype and increased PGC1-α mRNA expression. Intriguingly, the brown adipose tissue marker UCP1 was modestly higher in old mice, while remained unchanged by the intervention. In conclusion, in the absence of obesity, visceral adipose tissue possesses a pronounced anti-inflammatory phenotype during aging which is further enhanced by exercise.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649314>The Interactome analysis of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus protein -1 suggests a new role in viral mRNA  post-transcription.</a></h2><p>Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a globally prevalent negative-stranded RNA virus, which can cause life-threatening respiratory infections in young children, elderly people and immunocompromised patients. Its transcription termination factor -1 plays an essential role in viral transcription, but the mechanisms underpinning its function are still unclear. We investigated the cellular interactome of -1 using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-trap immunoprecipitation on RSV infected cells coupled with mass spectrometry analysis. We identified 137 potential cellular partners of -1, among which many proteins associated with mRNA , and particularly mRNA maturation, translation and stabilization. Among these, the cytoplasmic polyA-binding protein 1 (PABPC1), a candidate with a major role in both translation and mRNA stabilization, was confirmed to interact with -1 using protein complementation assay and specific immunoprecipitation. PABPC1 was also shown to colocalize with -1 from its accumulation in inclusion bodies associated granules (IBAGs) to its liberation in the cytoplasm. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that -1 interacts with viral mRNA and mRNA  factors from transcription to translation, and imply that -1 may have an additional role in the fate of viral mRNA downstream of transcription.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337415>Purple corn extract induces long-lasting reprogramming and  phenotypic switch of adipose tissue macrophages in obese mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a chronic and systemic inflammatory disorder and an important risk factor for the onset of several chronic syndromes. Adipose tissue (AT) plays a crucial role in the development of obesity, promoting the infiltration and accumulation of leukocytes in the tissue and sustaining adipocyte expansion. Anthocyanins exert a broad range of health benefits, but their effect in improving obesity-related inflammation in vivo has been poorly characterized. We examined the effects of a purple corn cob extract in the context of AT inflammation in a murine diet-induced obesity (DIO) model.Male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to control diet (CTR + HO), high fat diet (HF + HO) or high fat diet plus purple corn extract (HF + RED) for 12 weeks. Blood glucose, AT, and liver gene expression, , biochemistry, and histology were analysed and flow cytometry was performed on AT leukocytes and Kupffer cells.RED extract intake resulted in lower MCP-1 mediated recruitment and proliferation of macrophages into crown-like structures in the AT. AT macrophages (ATM) of HF + RED group upregulated  markers (ArgI, Fizz1, TGFβ), downregulating inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, COX-2) thanks to the suppression of NF-kB signalling. ATM also increased the expression of iron -related genes (FABP4, Hmox1, Ferroportin, CD163, TfR1, Ceruloplasmin, FtL1, FtH1) associated with a reduction in iron storage and increased turnover. ATM from HF + RED mice did not respond to LPS treatment ex vivo, confirming the long-lasting effects of the treatment on  polarization. Adipocytes of HF + RED group improved lipid  and displayed a lower inflammation grade. Liver histology revealed a remarkable reduction of steatosis in the HF + RED group, and Kupffer cell profiling displayed a marked switch towards the  phenotype.RED extract attenuated AT inflammation in vivo, with a long-lasting reprogramming of ATM and adipocyte profiles towards the anti-inflammatory phenotype, therefore representing a valuable supplement in the context of obesity-associated disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555815>Sleep duration and quality are not associated with brown adipose tissue volume or activity-as determined by 18F-FDG uptake, in young, sedentary adults.</a></h2><p>Short sleep duration and sleep disturbances have been related to obesity and metabolic disruption. However, the behavioral and physiological mechanisms linking sleep and alterations in energy balance and metabolism are incompletely understood. In rodents, sleep regulation is closely related to appropriate brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic activity, but whether the same is true in humans has remained unknown. The present work examines whether sleep duration and quality are related to BAT volume and activity (measured by 18F-FDG) and BAT radiodensity in humans.A total of 118 healthy adults (69% women, 21.9 ± 2.2 years, body mass index: 24.9 ± 4.7 kg/) participated in this cross-sectional study. Sleep duration and other sleep variables were measured using a wrist-worn accelerometer for seven consecutive days for 24 hours per day. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to assess sleep quality. All participants then underwent a personalized cold exposure to determine their BAT volume, activity, and radiodensity (a proxy of the intracellular triglyceride content), using static positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CI) scan.Neither sleep duration nor quality was associated with BAT volume or activity (the latter represented by the mean and peak standardized 18F-FDG uptake values) or radiodensity (all p > .1). The lack of association remained after adjusting the analyses for sex, date of PET/CT, and body composition.Although experiments in rodent models indicate a strong relationship to exist between sleep regulation and BAT function, it seems that sleep duration and quality may not be directly related to the BAT variables examined in the present work.

Seven hundred thirty-eight T2DM patients were categorized into six groups, including 374 men and 364 post-menopausal women who were sub-divided into three groups based on albumin excretion that involved normal albuminuria, microalbuminuria, and large amount of albuminuria (138, 127, 109, 135, 125, and 104 cases, UACR<30, 30-300, and >300 mg/g, M1, , M3, F1, F2, and F3). Measurement of circulating miR-154-5p, OC, and other biochemical indicators were performed by real-time PCR, ELISA, and chemiluminescence assays in T2DM patients and in 141 M0 and 139 F0 control subjects.  There are few differences appeared between groups. Comparing with men, women had higher age, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), adiponectin (ADPN), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), UACR, procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), β-C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (β-CTx), OC, and miR-154-5p, but lower FPG, HOMA-IR, and HbA1c. T2DM patients with albuminuria (micro or macro) had lower bone turnover markers (P1NP, β-CTx, and OC) and adiponectin, but higher HbA1c, CTGF, and miR-154-5p. In addition, after regression analysis, UACR was positively correlated with CTGF, HbA1c, and miR-154-5p, and negatively correlated with ADPN and bone turnover markers (P1NP, β-CTx, and OC). However, OC showed a positive correlation with ADPN and other bone turnover markers (P1NP and β-CTx), but negative correlation with CTGF, UACR, and miR-154-5p in all three groups.  These findings suggested that increased serum levels of miR-154-5p and decreased OC levels may influence osteogenesis and proteinuria in T2DM and may identify novel targets for diagnosis and treatment of diabetic kidney disease and osteoporosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31529060>Association between body mass index and stroke risk among patients with type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>Very few studies focused on the association between body mass index (BMI) and stroke risk among patients with diabetes.We aimed to investigate the association between BMI and stroke risk in patients with type 2 diabetes.Demographic, anthropometric, laboratory and medication information were extracted from the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network common data model.We performed a retrospective cohort study of 67,086 patients with type 2 diabetes.Incident stroke including both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke were defined.During a mean follow up of 3.74 years. 8,918 incident stroke events occurred. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios across different categories of BMI at baseline (18.5-24.9 [reference group], 25.0-29.9, 30.0-34.9, 35.0-39.9, and ≥40 kg/) were 1.00, 0.92, 0.85, 0.74, and 0.63 (Ptrend <0.001) for total stroke, 1.00, 0.93, 0.88, 0.77, and 0.65 (Ptrend <0.001) for ischemic stroke, and 1.00, 0.79, 0.50, 0.50, and 0.41 (Ptrend <0.001) for hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. When we used an updated mean value of BMI, the graded inverse association of body mass index with stroke risk did not change. This linear association was consistent among patients of different subgroups. Further sensitivity analysis excluding patients who were diagnosed stroke within 6 months after first diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or including non-smokers only also confirmed our findings.The present study found an inverse association between BMI and the risk of total, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke among patients with type 2 diabetes.

The pharmacodynamic mechanisms of IMM-H004 are still under exploration. The present study was conducted to explore the pharmacoactive substances of IMM-H004 from the perspective of drug . Four metabolites of IMM-H004 including demethylated metabolites M1 and , glucuronide conjugate IMM-H004G (M3), and sulfated conjugate M4 were found in rats . IMM-H004G was the major metabolite in rats and cultured human hepatocytes, and uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) was found to catalyze the  of IMM-H004 in human liver microsomes (HLMs) and rat liver microsomes (RLMs) with high capacity (  at 3.25 and 5.04 nmol/min/mg protein). Among 13 recombinant human UGT isoforms, UGT1A7, 1A9, 1A8, and 1A1 appeared to be primarily responsible for IMM-H004G formation. The exposure and duration of IMM-H004G (28,948 h × ng/ml of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), 6.61 h of  ) was much higher than that of the parent drug (1,638 h × ng/ml of AUC, 0.42 h of  ) in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) rats, consistent with the malondialdehyde (MDA) inhibition effect for at least 10 h. Further pharmacological study revealed that IMM-H004G exhibited a similar neuroprotective activity to that of the parent drug on both oxygen-glucose deprivation injured PC12 cells and transient MCAO/R injured rats. These results demonstrate that both prototype and IMM-H004G are the active pharmaceutical substances, and IMM-H004G, at least in part, contributes to the maintenance of anti-cerebral ischemia efficacy of IMM-H004.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31318033>Moderate Postmeal Walking Has No Beneficial Effects Over Resting on Postprandial Lipemia, Glycemia, Insulinemia, and Selected Oxidative and Inflammatory Parameters in Older Adults with a Cardiovascular Disease Risk Phenotype: A Randomized Crossover Trial.</a></h2><p>Research suggests that postprandial events, as risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), are influenced by meal composition and exercise.We investigated the effect of walking versus rest on postprandial , inflammatory, and oxidative events following the consumption of test meals reflecting 2 different dietary patterns in older adults with an increased CVD risk.A randomized crossover trial was conducted in 26 men and women (aged 70 ± 5 y; BMI 30.3 ± 2.3 kg/).

In the present study we investigated the potential role of protein kinases in mediating this effect.MBZ potently binds and inhibits Dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1B (DYRK1B) with a Kd and an IC of 7 and 360 nM, respectively. The specific DYRK1B inhibitor AZ191 did not mimic the cytokine release profile of MBZ in untreated THP-1 monocytes. However, in THP-1 cells differentiated into macrophages, AZ191 strongly induced a pro-inflammatory cytokine release pattern similar to MBZ and LPS/IFNγ. Furthermore, like MBZ, AZ191 increased the expression of the M1 marker CD80 and decreased the  marker CD163 in THP-1 macrophages. In this model, AZ191 also increased phospho-ERK activity although to a lesser extent compared to MBZ. Taken together, the results demonstrate that DYRK1B inhibition could, at least partly, recapitulate immune responses induced by MBZ. Hence, DYRK1B inhibition induced by MBZ may be part of the mechanism of action to switch  to M1 macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31214190>Individual  Profiles of Microglia Polarization After Stroke, Represented by the Genes iNOS and Ym1.</a></h2><p>Microglia are the brain-innate immune cells which actively surveil their environment and mediate multiple aspects of neuroinflammation, due to their ability to acquire diverse activation states and phenotypes.

AHR expression is varied in the T cell subsets with the highest expression in T-helper 17 and T regulatory cells. It has been reported that AHR can act as a tumor promoter or a tumor suppressor, depending on the tumor type.  In an effort to understand the role played by AHR in tumor growth, the MC38 syngeneic colon carcinoma tumor model was used on C57BL/6 or  knockout (KO, -/-) mice with or without AHR antagonist (CH223191) treatment. Tumor sizes were measured, and biomarkers were quantified in tumor microenvironment and draining lymph nodes using flow cytometry. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the amount of cytokines in tumors.  In  deficient mice, MC38 tumors progress more rapidly than in wild-type mice, accompanied by an increase in tumor-associated macrophages and  macrophages and a decrease in CD8a positive cytotoxic lymphocytes. Analysis of cytokines in the tumor microenvironment reveals a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Similar changes were observed by pharmacologic blockade of the receptor using CH223191.

The baseline serum values of IL-4 and IL-13 and anthropometric features were measured 1 day before the beginning of exercise intervention and 1 day after the last training session in a fasting state. Results Six weeks of HIIT significantly increased the baseline serum levels of IL-4 (p = 0.022) and IL-13 (p = 0.014) in overweight adolescent boys. In addition, body weight (BW), BMI and body fat percent (BF%) were reduced in response to HIIT. Moreover, significantly negative correlations were found between changes of IL-4 and IL-13 with changes of BW, BMI and BF%. Conclusions HIIT seems to be an appropriate exercise modality for overweight adolescent boys to induce an anti-inflammatory cytokine response and, to improve body composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076418>Characterization of Glycolytic Enzymes and Pyruvate Kinase  in Type 1 and 2 Diabetic Nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Elevated glycolytic enzymes in renal glomeruli correlated with preservation of renal function in the Medalist Study, individuals with ≥50 years of type 1 diabetes. Specifically, pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) activation protected insulin-deficient diabetic mice from hyperglycemia-induced glomerular pathology. This study aims to extend these findings in a separate cohort of individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and discover new circulatory biomarkers for renal protection through proteomics and metabolomics of Medalists' plasma. We hypothesize that increased glycolytic flux and improved mitochondrial biogenesis will halt the progression of diabetic nephropathy.Immunoblots analyzed selected glycolytic and mitochondrial enzymes in postmortem glomeruli of non-Medalists with type 1 diabetes ( = 15), type 2 diabetes ( = 19), and no diabetes ( = 5). Plasma proteomic (SOMAscan) ( = 180) and metabolomic screens ( = 214) of Medalists with and without stage 3b chronic kidney disease (CKD) were conducted and significant markers validated by ELISA.Glycolytic (PKM1, PKM2, and ENO1) and mitochondrial (MTCO2) enzymes were significantly elevated in glomeruli of CKD- versus CKD+ individuals with type 2 diabetes. Medalists' plasma PKM2 correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (  = 0.077;  = 0.0002). Several glucose and mitochondrial enzymes in circulation were upregulated with corresponding downregulation of toxic metabolites in CKD-protected Medalists. Amyloid precursor protein was also significantly upregulated, tumor necrosis factor receptors downregulated, and both confirmed by ELISA.Elevation of enzymes involved in the  of intracellular free glucose and its metabolites in renal glomeruli is connected to preserving kidney function in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The renal profile of elevated glycolytic enzymes and reduced toxic glucose metabolites is reflected in the circulation, supporting their use as biomarkers for endogenous renal protective factors in people with diabetes.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504709>Whole Grain Wheat Consumption Affects Postprandial Inflammatory Response in a Randomized Controlled Trial in Overweight and Obese Adults with Mild Hypercholesterolemia in the Graandioos Study.</a></h2><p>Whole grain wheat (WGW) consumption is associated with health benefits in observational studies. However, WGW randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies show mixed effects.The health impact of WGW consumption was investigated by quantification of the body's resilience, which was defined as the "ability to adapt to a standardized challenge."A double-blind RCT was performed with overweight and obese (BMI: 25-35 kg/) men (n = 19) and postmenopausal women (n = 31) aged 45-70 y, with mildly elevated plasma total cholesterol (>5 mmol/L), who were randomly assigned to either 12-wk WGW (98 g/d) or refined wheat (RW). Before and after the intervention a standardized mixed-meal challenge was performed. Plasma samples were taken after overnight fasting and postprandially (30, 60, 120, and 240 min). Thirty-one biomarkers were quantified focusing on , liver, cardiovascular health, and inflammation. Linear mixed-models evaluated fasting compared with postprandial intervention effects. Health space models were used to evaluate intervention effects as composite markers representing resilience of inflammation, liver, and .Postprandial biomarker changes related to liver showed decreased alanine aminotransferase by WGW (P = 0.03) and increased β-hydroxybutyrate (P = 0.001) response in RW. Postprandial changes related to inflammation showed increased C-reactive protein (P = 0.001), IL-6 (P = 0.02), IL-8 (P = 0.007), and decreased IL-1B (P = 0.0002) in RW and decreased C-reactive protein (P < 0.0001), serum amyloid A (P < 0.0001), IL-8 (P = 0.02), and IL-10 (P < 0.0001) in WGW. Health space visualization demonstrated diminished inflammatory (P < 0.01) and liver resilience (P < 0.01) by RW, whereas liver resilience was rejuvenated by WGW (P < 0.05).Twelve-week 98 g/d WGW consumption can promote liver and inflammatory resilience in overweight and obese subjects with mildly elevated plasma cholesterol.

There might be differences in the fatty acid (FA) handling in adipose tissue when both ethnicities are exposed to high-fat overfeeding. The objective of the present study was to investigate the molecular adaptation in relation to FA  in response to overfeeding with a high-fat diet (OHFD) in South Asian and Caucasian men. Ten South Asian men (BMI 18-29 kg/) and ten Caucasian men (BMI 22-33 kg/), matched for body fat percentage, aged 20-40 years were included. A weight-maintenance diet (30 % fat, 55 % carbohydrate and 15 % protein) was given for 3 d followed by 3 d of overfeeding (150 % energy requirement) with a high-fat diet (60 % fat, 25 % carbohydrate and 15 % protein) while staying in a respiration chamber. Before and after overfeeding, abdominal subcutaneous fat biopsies were taken. Proteins were isolated, analysed and quantified for short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH), carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1α (CPT1a), adipose TAG lipase, perilipin A (PLINA), perilipin B, lipoprotein lipase and fatty acid binding protein 4 using Western blotting. OHFD decreased the HADH level (P < 0·05) in Caucasians more than in Asians (P < 0·05), but the baseline and after intervention HADH level was relatively higher in Caucasians. The level of CPT1a decreased in South Asians and increased in Caucasians (P < 0·05). PLINA did not change with diet but the level was higher in South Asians (P < 0·05). The observed differences in HADH and PLINA levels as well as in CPT1a response may be important for differences in the long-term regulation of energy (fat)  in these populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652246>Football Increases Future Risk for Symptomatic Radiographic Knee Osteoarthritis.</a></h2><p>Male youth in the United States commonly participate in gridiron (American) football. There are little data substantiating current popular opinion that it is associated with knee pain or osteoarthritis (OA) later in life. We aimed to evaluate the relationship of football with these outcomes in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI).This is a study of male OAI participants with knee x-ray readings, symptom assessments, and completed surveys on lifetime physical activity. The OAI is a multi-center, observational cohort recruited from the community not based on football participation status. A history of exposure to American football was ascertained via self-report. Knee radiographs were scored for Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade (0-4). Radiographic OA (ROA) was defined as KL ≥ 2 in at least one knee. Frequent knee pain meant at least one knee with frequent knee pain. Symptomatic radiographic OA (SOA) required at least one knee with both ROA and frequent knee pain.1166 men had a mean age of 63.7 (SD 9.2) years and body mass index of 28.6 (SD 4.2) kg/. 31% (365/1166) played football at some point in their lives, 95% of whom participated from ages 12 - 18 years. The ORs for SOA from lowest to highest football participation were 1.2, 1.5, and 2.2 respectively (p for trend = 0.004). Findings were similar for football from ages 12 - 18 years and for outcomes of knee pain and ROA.This is the first large epidemiologic study to suggest that football participation, including in the teen years, may be detrimental towards knee health.

However, data regarding its impact on renal outcomes are scarce. We conducted a single-center, prospective cohort study of 339 type 2 diabetic patients with anemia. The primary outcome was the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope for two years. We performed multiple linear regression and restricted cubic spline analyses to assess the association of serum EPO levels with the renal outcome. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73  or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio >30 mg/g creatinine. Median baseline EPO and eGFR level were 14.4 IU/L and 53 mL/min/1.73 m, respectively. Inappropriately low EPO levels were observed in 73% of anemic patients and 59% of anemic patients even without CKD, suggesting that EPO deficiency precedes the onset of CKD in diabetes mellitus. Multivariable analysis revealed that iron status and hemoglobin levels were major determinants of EPO levels. Median eGFR slope was -1.3 mL/min/1.73 m/year. We found that low EPO levels, but not low hemoglobin levels, were associated with a faster decline in eGFR, independent of clinically relevant factors. The eGFR decline was steeper, particularly when the EPO level was below the upper limit of normal. Lower EPO concentrations were associated with rapid eGFR decline, especially in patients with iron deficiency (P for interaction = 0.01). Relative EPO deficiency should be considered as a culprit in anemia of unknown etiology in diabetic patients, even those without CKD. Low EPO levels, especially when accompanied by poor iron status, are predictive of rapid loss of renal function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31067702>High Molecular Weight Hyaluronan Suppresses Macrophage M1 Polarization and Enhances IL-10 Production in PM-Induced Lung Inflammation.</a></h2><p>PM is particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less. Airway macrophages are the key players regulating PM-induced inflammation. High molecular weight hyaluronan (HMW-HA) has previously been shown to exert protective effects on PM-induced acute lung injury and inflammation. However, little is known about the detailed mechanism. In this study, we aimed to determine whether HMW-HA alleviates PM-induced pulmonary inflammation by modulating macrophage polarization. The levels of M1 biomarkers TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, CXCL1, CXCL2, NOS2 and CD86, as well as  biomarkers IL-10, MRC1, and Arg-1 produced by macrophages were measured by ELISA, qPCR, and flow cytometry. In addition, the amount of M1 macrophages in lung tissues was examined by immunofluorescence of CD68 and NOS2. We observed a decline in PM-induced M1 polarization both in macrophages and lung tissues when HMW-HA was administered simultaneously. Meanwhile, western blot analysis revealed that PM-induced JNK and p38 phosphorylation was suppressed by HMW-HA. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies showed that co-stimulation with HMW-HA and PM promoted the expression and release of IL-10, but exhibited limited effects on the transcription of MRC1 and ARG1. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that HMW-HA ameliorates PM-induced lung inflammation by repressing M1 polarization through JNK and p38  and promoting the production of pro-resolving cytokine IL-10.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31469916>CRAF methylation by PRMT6 regulates aerobic glycolysis driven hepatocarcinogenesis via ERK-dependent PKM2 nuclear relocalization and activation.</a></h2><p>Most tumor cells use aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) to support anabolic growth and promote tumorigenicity and drug resistance. Intriguingly, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well understood. In this work, using gain- and loss-of-function in vitro studies in patient-derived organoid and cell cultures as well as in vivo PET-MRI animal models, we showed that PRMT6 regulates aerobic glycolysis in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through nuclear relocalization of pyruvate kinase  isoform (PKM2), a key regulator of the Warburg effect. We found PRMT6 to methylate CRAF at arginine 100, interfere with its RAS/RAF binding potential and as a result alter ERK-mediated PKM2 translocation into the nucleus. This altered PRMT6-ERK-PKM2 signaling axis was further confirmed in both a HCC mouse model with endogenous knockout of PRMT6 as well as in HCC clinical samples. We also identified PRMT6 as a novel target of hypoxia via the transcriptional repressor REST, linking PRMT6 with hypoxia in driving glycolytic events. Finally, we showed as a proof-of-concept the therapeutic potential of using 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), a glycolysis inhibitor, to reverse tumorigenicity and sorafenib resistance mediated by PRMT6 deficiency in HCC. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the PRMT6-ERK-PKM2 regulatory axis is an important determinant of the Warburg effect in tumor cells and provide a mechanistic link between tumorigenicity, sorafenib resistance and glucose .© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31277152>An immune-related gene signature predicts prognosis of gastric cancer.</a></h2><p>Although the outcome of patients with gastric cancer (GC) has improved significantly with the recent implementation of annual screening programs. Reliable prognostic biomarkers are still needed due to the disease heterogeneity. Increasing pieces of evidence revealed an association between immune signature and GC prognosis. Thus, we aim to build an immune-related signature that can estimate prognosis for GC.For identification of a prognostic immune-related gene signature (IRGS), gene expression profiles and clinical information of patients with GC were collected from 3 public cohorts, divided into training cohort (n = 300) and 2 independent validation cohorts (n = 277 and 433 respectively).Within 1811 immune genes, a prognostic IRGS consisting of 16 unique genes was constructed which was significantly associated with survival (hazard ratio [HR], 3.9 [2.78-5.47]; P < 1.0 × 10). In the validation cohorts, the IRGS significantly stratified patients into high- vs low-risk groups in terms of prognosis across (HR, 1.84 [1.47-2.30]; P = 6.59 × 10) and within subpopulations with stage I&II disease (HR, 1.96 [1.34-2.89]; P = 4.73 × 10) and was prognostic in univariate and multivariate analyses. Several biological processes, including TGF-β and EMT signaling , were enriched in the high-risk group. T cells CD4 memory resting and Macrophage  were significantly higher in the high-risk risk group compared with the low-risk group.In short, we developed a prognostic IRGS for estimating prognosis in GC, including stage I&II disease, providing new insights into the identification of patients with GC with a high risk of mortality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30998685>APOL1 renal risk variants promote cholesterol accumulation in tissues and cultured macrophages from APOL1 transgenic mice.</a></h2><p>Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) genetic variants G1 and G2, compared to the common allele G0, are major risk factors for non-diabetic kidney disease in African descent populations. APOL1 is a minor protein component of HDL, as well as being expressed in podocytes and vascular cells. Reverse cholesterol transport involves the transport of cholesterol to HDL by cellular ATP-binding cassette; ABCA1 and ABCG1 with subsequent delivery from peripheral tissues to the liver. With impaired reverse cholesterol transport, lipid accumulation occurs and macrophages morphologically transform into foam cells, releasing inflammatory factors. We asked whether the APOL1 risk variants alter peripheral cholesterol  and specifically affect macrophage cholesterol efflux. Tissues and bone marrow (BM)-derived monocytes were isolated from wild-type mice (WT) and from BAC/APOL1 transgenic (APOL1-G0, APOL1-G1, and APOL1-G2) mice, which carry a bacterial artificial chromosome that contains the human APOL1 genomic region. Monocytes were differentiated into macrophages using M-CSF, and then polarized into M1 and  macrophages. Cholesterol content, cholesterol efflux, and ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA expression were measured. Kidney, spleen, and bone marrow-derived macrophages from APOL1-G1 and -G2 mice showed increased cholesterol accumulation and decreased ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA levels. BM-derived macrophages from APOL1-G1 and -G2 mice showed significantly reduced cholesterol efflux compared to WT or APOL1-G0 macrophages. Taken together, the evidence suggests that APOL1-G1 and -G2 risk variants impaired reverse cholesterol transport through decreased expression of cholesterol efflux transporters suggesting a possible mechanism to promote macrophage foam cell formation, driving inflammation in the glomerulus and renal interstitium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31371090>-like cells from the macrophage lineage might play a central role in closure of the embryonic neural tube.</a></h2><p>Herein it is hypothesized that -like macrophages or pre-macrophages of fetal origin might play a central role in development and closure of the neural tube. Early in embryonic development, pre-macrophages arise from the fetal yolk sac and track through the bloodstream to reach diverse embryonic tissues, where they mature. Most of these macrophages exhibit an -like phenotype. The critical period for neural tube closure is contained within the period of yolk sac-derived pre-macrophage tracking and distribution, which poses a question: might these pre-macrophages or macrophages exert an influence on the closing neural tube? Evidence suggests that perturbations in macrophage polarization or  macrophage function might contribute to the failure of neural tube closure associated with diabetes mellitus, one carbon  (including folic acid deficit), inositol, arachidonic acid, and sphingosine-1-phosphate, as well as in the teratogenicity of nitric acid, valproic acid, and fumonisin. The influence of each of these factors is interpreted in light of potential interactions with -like macrophages or macrophage progenitors on the developing neural tube. By placing these anti inflammatory macrophages at the center of various epigenetic, neurochemical, and signaling processes suspected to be involved in neural tube closure, potential associations are revealed between macrophages and embryonic structural developmental processes such as collagen and actin dynamics. The choice of this model is also an attempt to explain why some etiologies for failure of neural tube closure are rescued by folic acid, whereas other etiologies are rescued only by formate, inositol, or not at all.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We sought to determine whether routinely available outpatient random plasma glucose (RPG) would be useful to facilitate the diagnosis of diabetes.Retrospective cohort study of 942,446 U.S. Veterans without diagnosed diabetes, ≥3 RPG in a baseline year, and ≥1 primary care visit/year during 5-year follow-up. The primary outcome was incident diabetes (defined by diagnostic codes and outpatient prescription of a diabetes drug).Over 5 years, 94,599 were diagnosed with diabetes [DIAB] while 847,847 were not [NONDIAB]. Baseline demographics of DIAB and NONDIAB were clinically similar, except DIAB had higher BMI (32 vs. 28 kg/) and RPG (150 vs. 107 mg/dl), and were more likely to have Black race (18% vs. 15%), all p<0.001. ROC area for prediction of DIAB diagnosis within 1 year by demographic factors was 0.701, and 0.708 with addition of SBP, non-HDL cholesterol, and smoking. These were significantly less than that for prediction by baseline RPG alone (≥2 RPGs at/above a given level, ROC 0.878, p<0.001), which improved slightly when other factors were added (ROC 0.900, p<0.001). Having ≥2 RPGs ≥115 mg/dl had specificity 77% and sensitivity 87%, and ≥2 RPGs ≥130 mg/dl had specificity 93% and sensitivity 59%. For predicting diagnosis within 3 and 5 years by RPG alone, ROC was reduced but remained substantial (ROC 0.839 and 0.803, respectively).RPG levels below the diabetes "diagnostic" range (≥200 mg/dl) provide good discrimination for follow-up diagnosis. Use of such levels-obtained opportunistically, during outpatient visits-could signal the need for further testing, allow preventive intervention in high risk individuals before onset of disease, and lead to earlier identification of diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504693>Lipolysis and Fat Oxidation Are Not Altered with Presleep Compared with Daytime Casein Protein Intake in Resistance-Trained Women.</a></h2><p>To date, no studies have directly compared the differences between presleep and daytime protein (PRO) consumption on localized and systemic fat  in active women.The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of presleep compared with daytime PRO supplementation on subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SCAAT) lipolysis and whole-body substrate utilization in women.Thirteen young (mean ± SE age: 22 ± 1 y; BMI: 24.3 ± 0.8 kg/), resistance-trained [1 repetition maximum (1RM) squat percentage of body weight: 135% ± 6%; 1RM bench press percentage of body weight: 82% ± 4%] women volunteered. On overnight experimental visits, participants performed full-body resistance exercise (RE; 65% 1RM) and were randomly assigned to consume either daytime PRO (PRO, 30 g casein) 30 min post-RE and presleep (30 min before bed) noncaloric, sensory-matched placebo (PLA, 0 g casein) (PRO-PLA), or the opposite (PLA-PRO), switching the order of the supplements on the following visit. SCAAT lipolysis, resting  (indirect calorimetry), and plasma biomarkers (glucose, insulin, nonesterified fatty acids, glycerol) were measured at baseline, overnight, and the next morning.There were no differences in overnight SCAAT lipolysis between conditions indicated by interstitial glycerol concentrations (PRO-PLA: baseline, 669 ± 137; next morning, 321 ± 77.1; PLA-PRO: baseline, 524 ± 109; next morning, 333 ± 68.0 μM), fat oxidation (PRO-PLA: baseline, 5.70 ± 0.35; next morning, 5.00 ± 0.28; PLA-PRO: baseline, 6.59 ± 0.32; next morning, 5.44 ± 0.27 g/min), or any other measure.There was no difference between the effects of daytime and presleep PRO supplementation on SCAAT lipolysis or whole-body substrate utilization in resistance-trained women. Presleep PRO is a viable option for increasing PRO consumption in resistance-trained women because it does not blunt overnight lipolysis, and will therefore likely not lead to increases in subcutaneous abdominal fat.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as .Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401304>Pyruvate kinase : A simple molecule with complex functions.</a></h2><p>Pyruvate kinase  is a critical enzyme that regulates cell  and growth under different physiological conditions.

DNA of M. tuberculosis (MtbDNA) is recognized by macrophages, but the implications of this recognition are poorly characterized. Stimulation of murine macrophages with MtbDNA induces autophagy, a process that promotes elimination of intracellular pathogens. However, it remains unknown whether this or other phenomena also occur in human cells. In this work, we studied the innate response profiles of human macrophages after stimulation with DNA from virulent M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Human monocyte-derived macrophages were polarized into M1 and  phenotypes and stimulated with MtbDNA. The plasma membrane markers of the phenotype, production of TNF-α, and induction of autophagy were evaluated. Our results indicate that MtbDNA induced phenotypical changes, the significant production of TNF-α, and autophagy confirmed by the augmented expression of immunity related GTPase M (IRGM) and autophagy related ATG16L1 genes in M1 macrophages, whereas  macrophages exhibited limited responses. In addition, MtbDNA activation was TLR-9-dependent. Although TLR-9 expression was similar between M1 and  macrophages, only M1 macrophages were fully responsive to MtbDNA. In conclusion, MtbDNA recognition enhanced the antimicrobial mechanisms of M1 macrophages.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Eight of them were with genome-wide significance and two with a border line association. Since these data have not been studied in an independent Han Chinese population, we aimed to investigate the association of these susceptibility loci with type 2 diabetes in an independent Han Chinese population. We executed a case-control study in 2 000 Chinese by the SNPscan method. Firstly, the repetitive sequences of 10 loci were assessed. Next, we investigated the association of 8 SNPs out of 10 with type 2 diabetes and constructed the GRS of those 8 SNPs. Finally, the relationship of the 8 loci and diabetes-related traits was analyzed. Based on the fact, that highly repetitive sequences were detected in 2 SNPs, we investigated the remaining 8 SNPs. With the exception of four SNPs (CMIP rs16955379, PEPD rs3786897, PSMD6 rs831571, ZFAND3 rs9470794), the other SNPs had the same direction of effect (odds ratio [OR]>1.0) as in the original reports, especially GLIS3 rs7041847 and KCNK16 rs1535500 were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes (rs1535500: p=0.005, OR=1.224, 95% CI 1.062-1.409; rs7041847: p=0.035, OR=1.118, 95% CI 1.070-1.388). The GRS constructed from the 8 SNPs was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes in the Chinese population (p=0.004, OR=1.065, 95% CI: 1.021-1.111). Among the participants with 24≤BMI<28 kg/ the 8 SNPs were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes (p=0.040, OR=1.079, 95% CI: 1.003-1.160).

But thyroid hormones also produce non-genomic effects that typically start at the plasma membrane and are mediated mainly by integrin αvβ3, although other receptors such as TRα and TRβ are also able to elicit non-genomic responses. In the liver, the effects of thyroid hormones appear to be particularly important. The liver is able to regenerate, but it is subject to pathologies that may lead to cancer, such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In addition, cancer cells undergo a reprogramming of their , resulting in drastic changes such as aerobic glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation. As a consequence, the pyruvate kinase isoform , the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, is dysregulated, and this is considered an important factor in tumorigenesis. Redox equilibrium is also important, in fact cancer cells give rise to the production of more reactive oxygen species (ROS) than normal cells. This increase may favor the survival and propagation of cancer cells. We evaluate the possible mechanisms involving the plasma membrane receptor integrin αvβ3 that may lead to cancer progression. Studying diseases that affect the liver and their experimental models may help to unravel the cellular  mediated by integrin αvβ3 that can lead to liver cancer. Inhibitors of integrin αvβ3 might represent a future therapeutic tool against liver cancer. We also include information on the possible role of exosomes in liver cancer, as well as on recent strategies such as organoids and spheroids, which may provide a new tool for research, drug discovery, and personalized medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208190>Dudleya brittonii extract promotes survival rate and -like  change in porcine 3D4/31 alveolar macrophages.</a></h2><p>Although alveolar macrophages play a key role in the respiratory immunity of livestock, but studies on the mechanism of differentiation and survival of alveolar macrophages are lacking.

To confirm cell death, cell cycle and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels were measured using flow cytometric analysis by applying fluorescence dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) and propidium iodide (PI). Furthermore, we also evaluated cellular lipid accumulation with Oil Red O staining, and fatty acid synthesis related genes expression levels using quantitative PCR (qPCR) with SYBR green dye. Glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle related gene expression levels were measured using qPCR after exposure to Dudleya brittonii extract (DB) for 12 h.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell death were induced by PMA treatment, and exposure to DB reduced the PMA induced downregulation of cell survival. PMA and DB treatments upregulated the lipid accumulation, with corresponding increase in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACACA), fatty acid synthase (FASN) mRNA expressions. DB-PMA co-treatment reduced the glycolysis genes expression, but increased the expressions of fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle genes.This study provides new insights and directions for further researches relating to the immunity of porcine respiratory system, by employing a model based on alveolar macrophages and natural materials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31143115> and   of a Potent Inhibitor of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase, 1-(1-Propionylpiperidin-4-yl)-3-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl)urea.</a></h2><p>1-(1-Propionylpiperidin-4-yl)-3-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl)urea (TPPU) is a potent soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitor that is used extensively in research for modulating inflammation and protecting against hypertension, neuropathic pain, and neurodegeneration. Despite its wide use in various animal disease models, the  of TPPU has not been well-studied. A broader understanding of its  is critical for determining contributions of metabolites to the overall safety and effectiveness of TPPU. Herein, we describe the identification of TPPU metabolites using LC-MS/MS strategies. Four metabolites of TPPU (M1-M4) were identified from rat urine by a sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS method with double precursor ion scans. Their structures were further supported by LC-MS/MS comparison with synthesized standards. Metabolites M1 and  were formed from hydroxylation on a propionyl group of TPPU; M3 was formed by amide hydrolysis of the 1-propionylpiperdinyl group on TPPU; and M4 was formed by further oxidation of the hydroxylated metabolite . Interestingly, the predicted α-keto amide metabolite and 4-(trifluoromethoxy)aniline (metabolite from urea cleavage) were not detected by the LC-MRM-MS method. This indicates that if formed, the two potential metabolites represent <0.01% of TPPU . Species differences in the formation of these four identified metabolites was assessed using liver S9 fractions from dog, monkey, rat, mouse, and human. M1, , and M3 were generated in liver S9 fractions from all species, and higher amounts of M3 were generated in monkey S9 fractions compared to other species. In addition, rat and human S9  showed the highest species similarity based on the quantities of each metabolite. The presence of all four metabolites were confirmed  in rats over 72-h post single oral dose of TPPU. Urine and feces were major routes for TPPU excretion. M1, M4 and parent drug were detected as major substances, and  and M3 were minor substances. In blood, M1 accounted for ~9.6% of the total TPPU-related exposure, while metabolites , M3, and M4 accounted for <0.4%. All four metabolites were potent inhibitors of human sEH but were less potent than the parent TPPU. In conclusion, TPPU is metabolized via oxidation and amide hydrolysis without apparent breakdown of the urea. The aniline metabolites were not observed either  or . Our findings increase the confidence in the ability to translate preclinical PK of TPPU in rats to humans and facilitates the potential clinical development of TPPU and other sEH inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31074785>Impaired Glucose-Stimulated Proinsulin Secretion Is an Early Marker of β-Cell Impairment Before Prediabetes Stage.</a></h2><p>Evidence indicates that there is substantial impairment/loss of β-cell function/mass even before prediabetes. Elevated plasma proinsulin is a sign of β-cell dysfunction in patients with diabetes/prediabetes. However, the dynamic changes of glucose stimulated proinsulin secretion (GSPS) among nondiabetic individuals remain obscure.To examine GSPS and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) among individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and to evaluate whether impaired GSPS is an early biomarker of β-cell impairment in individuals with NGT who have subthreshold postprandial plasma glucose (PPG).We evaluated GSPS and GSIS in 116 Chinese adults without diabetes (mean age ± SD, 33.31 ± 9.10 years; mean BMI, 25.24 ± 4.20 kg/) with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) < 5.6 mmol/L. Based on 2hPPG, the participants were divided into three groups: NGT1 (2hPPG < 6.67 mmol/L), NGT2 (6.67 ≤ 2hPPG < 7.78 mmol/L), and IGT (7.78 ≤ 2hPPG<11.1 mmol/L). We analyzed the association of GSIS and GSPS with commonly used indexes of β-cell function, insulin resistance and family history of diabetes.Although not diagnosed with prediabetes, the individuals with NGT2 have clinical characteristics and high diabetes risk factors similar to those of the IGT group. However, unlike individuals with IGT, NGT2 participants did not exhibit a delayed GSIS. Instead, GSPS was impaired in NGT2 groups but not in NGT1 group.This study suggests that impaired GSPS, but not impaired GSIS, may serve as an early biomarker to identify a subpopulation of NGT with a high risk of diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411498>GREATER SUPPRESSION OF GLUCAGON, LIPOLYSIS AND KETOGENESIS WITH INSULIN GLARGINE U300 AS COMPARED TO GLARGINE U100 IN TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS.</a></h2><p>The aim of study was to establish the effects of clinical doses of Gla-300 vs Gla-100 on suppression of glucagon, lipolysis and ketogenesis in T1DM.

This meta-analysis aimed to examine the combined effects of body mass index (BMI) and  status on CKD risk.The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Knowledge databases were systematically searched up to March 2019 to identify all eligible studies investigating the CKD risk (defined as GFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73  and/or microalbuminuria or proteinuria) associated with the body size phenotypes which are known as metabolically unhealthy normal-weight (MUNW), metabolically healthy overweight (MHOW), metabolically unhealthy overweight, metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUHO). The classification of subjects in included studies as metabolically unhealthy was based on the presence of three components of  syndrome. BMI categorization was based on the criteria of included studies. The risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted and pooled using random effects analysis.A total of 9 prospective cohort studies with 128773 participants and 4797 incident cases were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with healthy normal-weight individuals as reference, MUNW and MHO subjects showed an increased risk for CKD events with a pooled RR of 1.58 (95% CI = 1.28-1.96) in MUNW and 1.55 (95% CI = 1.34-1.79) in MHO persons. Also, MHOW was at increased risk for CKD (RR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.20-1.51). MUHO individuals were at the highest risk for the development of CKD (RR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.66-2.72).Individuals with  abnormality, although at normal-weight, have an increased risk for CKD. Healthy overweight and obese individuals had higher risk; refuting the notion that metabolically healthy overweight and obese phenotypes are benign conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31038559>SARCOPENIA, OBESITY AND SARCOPENIC OBESITY IN LIVER TRANSPLANTATION: A BODY COMPOSITION PROSPECTIVE STUDY.</a></h2><p>Sarcopenia is prevalent before liver transplantation, and it is considered to be a risk factor for morbidity/mortality.

The success or failure of these applications is largely contingent on the host responses to the matrices in vivo. Despite retaining their native structural and functional proteins, bone ECM-based transplants have been reported to evoke adverse immune responses in many cases; thus, optimizing the immunomodulatory properties of bone ECMs is critical for ensuring downstream regenerative outcomes. Using a simple digestion-neutralization protocol, we transformed the commonly used bone-derived filler particles into gel bioscaffolds. Instead of inducing macrophages toward proinflammatory (M1) polarization, as reported in the literature and confirmed in the present study for ECM particles, the ECM gels were found to be more likely to polarize macrophages toward regulatory/anti-inflammatory () phenotypes, leading to enhanced tissue regeneration in a rat periodontal defect model. The present work demonstrates a simple, practical and economical strategy to modify the immunomodulatory properties of bone ECMs before their in vivo transplantation and hence has important implications that may facilitate the use of ECM-based bioscaffolds derived from diverse sources of tissues for regenerative purposes.Copyright © 2019.

The potential of spot and cumulative urine samples that have reduced burden on participants as replacements for 24-h urine collections has not been evaluated.The aim of this study was to determine the utility of spot and cumulative urine samples for classifying the  profiles of people according to dietary intake when compared with 24-h urine collections in a controlled dietary intervention study.Nineteen healthy individuals (10 male, 9 female, aged 21-65 y, BMI 20-35 kg/) each consumed 4 distinctly different diets, each for 1 wk. Spot urine samples were collected ∼2 h post meals on 3 intervention days/wk. Cumulative urine samples were collected daily over 3 separate temporal periods. A 24-h urine collection was created by combining the 3 cumulative urine samples. Urine samples were analyzed with metabolite fingerprinting by both high-resolution flow infusion electrospray mass spectrometry (FIE-HRMS) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR). Concentrations of dietary intake biomarkers were measured with liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry and by integration of 1H-NMR data.Cross-validation modeling with 1H-NMR and FIE-HRMS data demonstrated the power of spot and cumulative urine samples in predicting dietary patterns in 24-h urine collections. Particularly, there was no significant loss of information when post-dinner (PD) spot or overnight cumulative samples were substituted for 24-h urine collections (classification accuracies of 0.891 and 0.938, respectively). Quantitative analysis of urine samples also demonstrated the relation between PD spot samples and 24-h urines for dietary exposure biomarkers.We conclude that PD spot urine samples are suitable replacements for 24-h urine collections. Alternatively, cumulative samples collected overnight predict similarly to 24-h urine samples and have a lower collection burden for participants.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555797>Reversal of the Warburg phenomenon in chemoprevention of prostate cancer by sulforaphane.</a></h2><p>Inhibition of  re-programming represents an attractive approach for prevention of prostate cancer. Studies have implicated increased synthesis of fatty acids or glycolysis in pathogenesis of human prostate cancers. We have shown previously that prostate cancer prevention by sulforaphane (SFN) in Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model is associated with inhibition of fatty acid . This study utilized human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, 22Rv1, and PC-3), two different transgenic mouse models (TRAMP and Hi-Myc), and plasma specimens from a clinical study to explore the glycolysis inhibition potential of SFN. We found that SFN treatment: (a) decreased real-time extracellular acidification rate in LNCaP, but not in PC-3 cell line ; (b) significantly downregulated expression of hexokinase II (HKII), pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), and/or lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) in vitro in cells and in vivo in neoplastic lesions in the prostate of TRAMP and Hi-Myc mice; and (c) significantly suppressed glycolysis in prostate of Hi-Myc mice as measured by ex vivo1 H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. SFN treatment did not decrease glucose uptake or expression of glucose transporters in cells. Overexpression of c-Myc, but not constitutively active Akt, conferred protection against SFN-mediated downregulation of HKII and LDHA protein expression and suppression of lactate levels. Examination of plasma lactate levels in prostate cancer patients following administration of a SFN-rich broccoli sprout extract failed to show declines in its levels. Additional clinical trials are needed to determine whether SFN treatment can decrease lactate production in human prostate tumors.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

However, this treatment can cause transient and prolonged neutropenia, which can result in fatal infection. Three recombinant human colony‑stimulating factors (CSFs), granulocyte CSF (G‑CSF), granulocyte‑macrophage CSF (GM‑CSF), and macrophage CSF (M‑CSF), are currently available to reduce the duration and degree of neutropenia. The present study investigated the pro‑ and anti‑tumor effects of these three CSFs and the changes in molecular profiles. Xenograft tumors in athymic mice were generated by subcutaneously inoculating the human bladder cancer cell lines MGH‑U3 and UM‑UC‑3. A total of 2 weeks after cell inoculation, mice were randomly divided into four groups (control, G‑CSF, GM‑CSF and M‑CSF) and treated thrice a week for 2 weeks. Tumor growth during monitoring and tumor weight at the time of euthanization were significantly higher in mice treated with G‑CSF and lower in mice treated with GM‑CSF compared with the control mice. Tumors were examined by immunostaining with antibodies against proteins associated tumor proliferation (Ki‑67), angiogenesis [CD31 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)], anti‑immunity (CD204) and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT; E‑cadherin). Immunohistochemical staining revealed that tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, recruitment of  macrophages and EMT were promoted by G‑CSF, whereas lymphangiogenesis and recruitment of  macrophages were inhibited by GM‑CSF. Treatment‑associated changes in serum pro‑ and anti‑tumoral cytokines and chemokines were evaluated by enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)‑based arrays. In the ELISA for serum, the levels of cytokines associated with angiogenesis (interleukin‑6 and VEGF), and EMT (transforming growth factor‑β1 and ‑β2) were elevated in mice treated with G‑CSF. Treatment with GM‑CSF and M‑CSF also affected the level of these cytokines characteristically. The current results indicate that administration of exogenous G‑CSF to patients with bladder cancer promotes tumor growth through promotion of cell proliferation, angiogenesis, recruitment of  macrophages and enhancement of EMT through the modulation of the tumor microenvironment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598726>Urinary chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 16 and endostatin as predictors of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in patients with advanced diabetic kidney disease.</a></h2><p>Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) is a well-recognized risk factor for poor renal outcome in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD). However, a noninvasive biomarker for IFTA is currently lacking. The purpose of this study was to identify urinary markers of IFTA and to determine their clinical relevance as predictors of renal prognosis.Seventy patients with biopsy-proven isolated DKD were enrolled in this study. We measured multiple urinary inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in these patients and evaluated their association with various pathologic features and renal outcomes.Patients enrolled in this study exhibited advanced DKD at the time of renal biopsy, characterized by moderate to severe renal dysfunction [mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 36.1 mL/min/1.73 ] and heavy proteinuria (mean urinary protein:creatinine ratio 7.8 g/g creatinine). Clinicopathologic analysis revealed that higher IFTA scores were associated with worse baseline eGFR (P < 0.001) and poor renal outcome (P = 0.002), whereas glomerular injury scores were not. Among measured urinary inflammatory markers, C-X-C motif ligand 16 (CXCL16) and endostatin showed strong correlations with IFTA scores (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively), and patients with higher levels of urinary CXCL16 and/or endostatin experienced significantly rapid renal progression compared with other patients (P < 0.001). Finally, increased urinary CXCL16 and endostatin were independent risk factors for poor renal outcome after multivariate adjustments (95% confidence interval 1.070-3.455, P = 0.029).Urinary CXCL16 and endostatin could reflect the degree of IFTA and serve as biomarkers of renal outcome in patients with advanced DKD.© The Author(s) 2019.

To help clarify this, we used a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) label free approach to characterize the proteomic profile of human microglia cell line (CHME-5) stimulated with gamma-interferon (IFN-γ) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) to induce a M1 or  phenotype, respectively. Outside the classical M1/ polarization markers, the M1 status appears to center around the activation of a classical inflammatory response and through the activation of multiple signaling .  polarization resulted in a different pattern of protein modulation related to RNA and cellular  processes. Together, our findings provide information regarding the protein changes specific to M1 and  activation states, and potentially link the polarization of microglia cells to the acquisition of a specific proteomic profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216384>Autologous transplantation of photoactivated subcutaneous adipose tissue improves glucose homeostasis in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence indicates that normal adipose tissue transplantation improves whole-body energy  and glucose homeostasis in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model. Adipose tissue macrophages are associated with glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes and obesity in humans, offering a potential target for therapeutics. However, whether transplantation of autologous adipose tissue that changes the macrophage phenotype directly contributes to systemic glucose intolerance has not been determined. We specifically developed our device, with more refined wavelengths of light to activate the macrophage phenotype in isolated subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) from host HFD mice. Autologous transplantation of photoactivated sWAT into HFD mice significantly reverses the M1 macrophage phenotype into , reduces the infiltration of macrophages in adipose tissues of HFD mice, and decreases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Strikingly, this transplantation reduced blood glucose levels and caused significant improvement in glucose tolerance, which was not shown in sham-operated or nonphotoactivated sWAT-transplanted HFD mice. Moreover, positron emission/computed tomography scans indicated higher glucose uptake in the heart but not in the liver, hindlimb muscles, or abdominal sWAT. These data suggested that the ability of photoactivation to shift Adipose tissue macrophage polarization in HFD mice caused a significant improvement in glucose homeostasis and that autologous transplantation might be a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of diabetes.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31251971>2,3'4,4',5-Pentachlorobiphenyl induces hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation through pyruvate kinase -dependent glycolysis.</a></h2><p>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are classic persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and are associated with the progression of many cancers, including liver cancer. The present study investigated the effect of 2,3'4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB118) on hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and its underlying mechanisms. The results indicated that PCB118 exposure promotes the proliferation and glycolysis of hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells. Moreover, PCB118 exposure increased the expression level of pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) and its nuclear translocation, whereas treatment with PKM2 shRNA suppressed the induction of cell proliferation and glycolysis by PCB118. PCB118 stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by activating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. Treatment with the antioxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) prevented PCB118-induced effects on PKM2, cell proliferation and glycolysis. Furthermore, we found that PCB118 activated NADPH oxidase through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in SMMC-7721 cells. Consistently, treatment with AhR shRNA suppressed PCB118-induced effects on PKM2, cell proliferation and glycolysis. Overall, these results indicated that PCB118 promotes HCC cell proliferation via PKM2-dependent upregulation of glycolysis, which is mediated by AhR/NADPH oxidase-induced ROS production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It has been proven that the increased density of ECM, especially collagen network, correlates with the poor distribution of gold-nanoparticles (GNPs) to the tumor mass. Here, for the first time, we examined the combined effect of collagenase (COL) with metformin (MET)-conjugated GNPs on mammosphere generated from JIMT-1 breast cell line in vitro.Mammospheres (on days 7 and 14) and monolayer culture were treated with MET, MET-GNPs, and a mixture of COL-GNPs and MET-GNPs for 5 days. To assess the impacts of the engineered nanoparticles (NPs) on the survival/apoptosis of cancer cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs), the amount/activity of collagen and the expression of pyruvate kinase , different methods were applied, including MTT, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, ELISA and real-time PCR analyses. Our results confirmed the enhanced cytotoxic effects of MET-GNPs combined with COL-GNPs on mammospheres compared to the cells treated with MET alone or MET-GNPs.Upon treatment with the mixture of MET-GNPs and COL-GNPs, the population of the apoptotic cells was significantly increased. A marked reduction was found in the number of CD24/CD44 CSCs and the amount of collagen in the group received a mixture of MET-GNPs and COL-GNPs.Based on our findings, the use of COL can improve the cellular interaction/penetration of MET-GNPs in mammospheres and its antitumor impacts on the CSCs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

During two meal challenge test visits subjects received standardized isocaloric (450 kcal) liquid meals: high-carbohydrate (HC, carbohydrates: 89% of energy) and normo-carbohydrate (NC, carbohydrates: 45% of energy). Fasting (0 min) and postprandial (30, 60, 120, 180 min) plasma samples were analyzed for metabolite profiles through untargeted metabolomics.  fingerprinting was performed on an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system connected to an iFunnel quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer.In HR-genotype men, after the intake of an HC-meal, we noted a significantly lower area under the curves (AUCs) of postprandial plasma concentrations of most of the phospholipids (-37% to -53%, variable importance in the projection (VIP) = 1.2-1.5), lysophospholipids (-29% to -86%, VIP = 1.1-2.6), sphingolipids (-32% to -47%, VIP = 1.1-1.3), as well as arachidonic (-36%, VIP = 1.4) and oleic (-63%, VIP = 1.3) acids, their metabolites: keto- and hydoxy-fatty acids (-38% to -78%, VIP = 1.3-2.5), leukotrienes (-65% to -83%, VIP = 1.4-2.2), uric acid (-59%, VIP = 1.5), and pyroglutamic acid (-65%, VIP = 1.8). The AUCs of postprandial sphingosine concentrations were higher (125-832%, VIP = 1.9-3.2) after the NC-meal, AUCs of acylcarnitines were lower (-21% to -61%, VIP = 1.1-2.4), and AUCs of fatty acid amides were higher (51-508%, VIP = 1.7-3.1) after the intake of both meals.In nondiabetic men carrying the TCF7L2 HR genotype, subtle but detectable modifications in intermediate lipid  are induced by an HC-meal.

We previously reported high PD-1/PDL-1 staining in ATC, raising the possibility of the productive application of the immunotherapeutic pembrolizumab. However, having found pembrolizumab to anecdotally have limited single-agent activity in ATC, we sought to alternatively define whether pembrolizumab might synergistically combine with chemoradiotherapy as initial ATC therapy.An investigator-initiated therapeutic phase 2 trial of pembrolizumab, 200 mg IV every 3 weeks, combined with chemoradiotherapy [docetaxel/doxorubicin, 20 mg/ each IV weekly plus volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)] was initiated as front-line therapy (with or without surgery) in ATC to assess efficacy and toxicities. Six-month overall survival (OS) was selected as the primary endpoint using a Simon's optimal design with interim analysis (targeting accrual of 25 patients; Cohort A: prior resection, Cohort B: no resection). Based upon a prior patient cohort treated similarly, but without pembrolizumab, the design was such that, if 6 month true survival is 75%, the probability of declaring the approach worthy of further pursuit would be 91%.Three patients were enrolled, two with rapidly enlarging unresectable neck masses. Early tumor responses were favorable in all three, and all three satisfactorily completed: intended radiotherapy, preceding and radiotherapy-concurrent pembrolizumab, and concurrent chemoradiotherapy. However, all three patients died <6 months following therapy initiation - one from pulmonary metastases, and two from otherwise unexpected fatal pulmonary complications occurring subsequent to chemoradiotherapy completion - prompting study closure.Although initially tolerated and effective in terms of locoregional disease control, disappointing survival outcomes compared to historical controls raise uncertainty that the piloted approach merits further pursuit in ATC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135122>PKM2 Knockdown Induces Autophagic Cell Death via AKT/mTOR Pathway in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) is essential for aerobic glycolysis. Although high PKM2 expression is observed in various cancer tissues, its functional role in cancer  is unclear. Here, we investigated the role of PKM2 in regulating autophagy and its associated  in prostate cancer cells.Immunohistochemistry was performed to compare the expression level of PKM2 in prostate cancer patients and normal human, whereas expression of PKM2 in several cell lines was also examined by using western blot. PKM2 expression was silenced using various small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Cell viability was examined using IncuCyte ZOOM™ live cell imaging system. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were performed to investigate the PKM2 knockdown on other cellular signaling molecules. Acridine orange and Monodansylcadaverine staining was performed to check effect of PKM2 knockdown on autophagy induction. High performance thin layer chromatography was carried out to quantify the level of different cellular metabolites (pyruvate and lactate). Colony formation assay was performed to determine the ability of a cells to form large colonies.PKM2 was highly expressed in prostate cancer patients as compared to normal human. PKM2 siRNA-transfected prostate cancer cells showed significantly reduced viability. Acridine orange, Monodansylcadaverine staining and western blotting analysis showed that PKM2 downregulation markedly increased autophagic cell death. Results of western blotting analysis showed that PKM2 knockdown affected protein kinase B/mechanistic target of rapamycin 1 pathway, which consequently downregulated the expression of glycolytic enzymes lactate dehydrogenase A and glucose transporter 1. Knockdown of PKM2 also reduced the colony formation ability of human prostate cancer cell DU145.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that PKM2 inhibition alters prostate cancer cell  and induces autophagy, thus providing new perspectives for developing PKM2-targeting anticancer therapies for treating prostate cancer.© Copyright by the Author(s).
