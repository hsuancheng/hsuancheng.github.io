Neutralizing antibodies targeting   programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1) have been particularly successful for tumor types with limited therapeutic options such as melanoma and lung cancer. However, reactivation of T cells is only one step toward tumor elimination, and a substantial fraction of patients fails to respond to these therapies. In this context, combination therapies targeting more than one of the steps of the cancer-  may provide significant benefits. To find the best combinations, it is of upmost importance to understand the interplay between cancer cells and all the components of the  response. This review focuses on the elements of the complement system that come into play in the cancer-immunity . The complement system, an essential part of innate immunity, has emerged as a major regulator of cancer immunity. Complement effectors such as C1q, anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, and their receptors C3aR and C5aR1, have been associated with tolerogenic  death and inhibition of antitumor T- responses through the recruitment and/or activation of immunosuppressive  subpopulations such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), or  tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Evidence is provided to support the idea that complement blocks many of the effector routes associated with the cancer-immunity , providing the rationale for new therapeutic combinations aimed to enhance the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1  inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30802149>Dual blockade of CXCL12-CXCR4 and PD-1-PD-L1 pathways prolongs survival of ovarian tumor-bearing mice by prevention of immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment.</a></h2><p>Blockade of - programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1) or programmed  death ligand 1 can enhance effector T- responses. However, the lack of response in many patients to -inhibitor therapies emphasizes the need for combination immunotherapies to pursue maximal antitumor efficacy. We have previously demonstrated that antagonism of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) by plerixafor (AMD3100) can decrease regulatory T (T)- intratumoral infiltration. Therefore, a combination of these 2 therapies might increase antitumor effects. Here, we evaluated the antitumor efficacy of AMD3100 and anti-PD-1 (αPD-1) antibody alone or in combination in an immunocompetent syngeneic mouse model of ovarian cancer. We found that AMD3100, a highly specific CXCR4 antagonist, directly down-regulated the expression of both C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) and CXCR4  and  in tumor cells. AMD3100 and αPD-1 significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice when given as monotherapy. Combination of these 2 agents significantly enhanced antitumor effects compared with single-agent administration. Benefits of tumor control and animal survival were associated with immunomodulation mediated by these 2 agents, which were characterized by increased effector T- infiltration, increased effector T- function, and increased memory T cells in tumor microenvironment. Intratumoral T cells were decreased, and conversion of T cells into T helper cells was increased by AMD3100 treatment. Intratumoral myeloid-derived suppressor cells were decreased by the combined treatment, which was associated with decreased IL-10 and IL-6 in the ascites. Also, the combination therapy decreased suppressive leukocytes and facilitated -to-M1 macrophage polarization in the tumor. These results suggest that AMD3100 could be used to target the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis to inhibit tumor growth and prevent multifaceted immunosuppression alone or in combination with αPD-1 in ovarian cancer, which could be clinically relevant to patients with this disease.-Zeng, Y., Li, B., Liang, Y., Reeves, P.

However, both primary and acquired resistance becomes one of the major obstacles, which greatly limits the long-lasting effects and wide application of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy. PD-1/PD-L1 both regulates and is regulated by cellular signaling pathways and epigenetic modification, thus inhibiting the proliferation and effector function of T and B cells. The lack of tumor antigens and effective antigen presentation, aberrant activation of oncogenic pathways, mutations in IFN-γ signaling, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment such as regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells,  macrophages, and immunoinhibitory cytokines can lead to resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. In this review, we describe PD-1 related signaling pathways, essential factors contributing to the resistance of PD-1 blockade, and discuss strategies to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility of combined epigenetic therapy with PD-1 blockade as a potential promising approach for cancer treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29966988>Photodynamic activity of Temoporfin nanoparticles induces a shift to the M1-like phenotype in -polarized macrophages.</a></h2><p>The monocyte/macrophage  lineage reveals an enormous plasticity, which is required for tissue homeostasis, but is also undermined in various disease states, leading to a functional involvement of macrophages in major human diseases such as atherosclerosis and cancer. We recently generated in vivo evidence that crystalline, nonfluorescent nanoparticles of the hydrophobic porphyrin-related photosensitizer Aluminum phthalocyanine are selectively dissolved and thus may be used for specific fluorescent labelling of rejected, but not of accepted xenotransplants. This led us to hypothesize that nanoparticles made of planar photosensitizers such as porphyrins and chlorins were preferentially taken up and dissolved by macrophages, which was verified by in vitro studies. Here, using an in vitro system for macrophage differentiation/polarization of the human monocyte THP-1  line, we demonstrate differential uptake/dissolution of Temoporfin-derived nanoparticles in polarized macrophages, which resulted in differential photosensitivity. More importantly, low dose photodynamic sensitization using Temoporfin nanoparticles can be used to trigger M1 re-polarization of THP-1 cells previously polarized to the  state. Thus, sublethal photodynamic treatment using Temoporfin nanoparticles might be applied to induce a phenotypic shift of tumor-associated macrophages for the correction of an immunosuppressive microenvironment in the treatment of cancer, which may synergize with   inhibition.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Two phase III trials demonstrated improved overall survival (OS) and a favorable safety profile with the anti-programmed death-1 antibody nivolumab versus docetaxel in patients with previously treated advanced squamous (CheckMate 017) and nonsquamous (CheckMate 057) NSCLC. We report results from ≥3 years' follow-up, including subgroup analyses of patients with liver metastases, who historically have poorer prognosis among patients with NSCLC.Patients were randomized 1 : 1 to nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or docetaxel (75 mg/ every 3 weeks) until progression or discontinuation. The primary end point of each study was OS. Patients with baseline liver metastases were pooled across studies by treatment for subgroup analyses.After 40.3 months' minimum follow-up in CheckMate 017 and 057, nivolumab continued to show an OS benefit versus docetaxel: estimated 3-year OS rates were 17% [95% confidence interval (CI), 14% to 21%] versus 8% (95% CI, 6% to 11%) in the pooled population with squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC. Nivolumab was generally well tolerated, with no new safety concerns identified. Of 854 randomized patients across both studies, 193 had baseline liver metastases. Nivolumab resulted in improved OS compared with docetaxel in patients with liver metastases (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.50-0.91), consistent with findings from the overall pooled study population (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.61-0.81). Rates of treatment-related hepatic adverse events (primarily grade 1-2 liver enzyme elevations) were slightly higher in nivolumab-treated patients with liver metastases (10%) than in the overall pooled population (6%).After 3 years' minimum follow-up, nivolumab continued to demonstrate an OS benefit versus docetaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC.

A series of 72 cases included 56 UC, 43 non-SR (with first-line treatment 5-ASA) and 13 SR, 11 infectious colitis and 5 normal colonic biopsies. Normal mucosa was characterized by low infiltrates but high BTLA and TNFRSF14. Compared to normal, UC had increased pan--markers of CD3, CD8, FOXP3, PD-1, CD68, CD16, CD163, PTX3 and CD11C but had decreased BTLA (P < 0.05); by GSEA analysis comparable results were found in an independent UC gene-expression-data set (GSE38713). Compared to infectious, UC had higher CD4, CD8, PTX3 and CD11C but lower BTLA (P < 0.05). Compared to non-SR, SR had lower FOXP3 + Tregs (Odds-Ratio = 0.114, P = 0.002), PD-1 (OR = 0.176, P = 0.002) and CD163/CD68 -ratio (OR, 0.019, P = 0.019) but higher CD68 + pan-macrophages (OR = 6.034, P = 0.002). Higher Baron endoscopic and Geboes histologic disease activity scores also correlated with SR. In summary, UC was characterized by increased pan--markers, normal TNFRSF14 and low BTLA. SR had increased CD68 + pan-macrophages but lower  inhibitors of FOXP3 + Tregs, PD-1 and CD163/CD68 -macrophage ratio. In conclusion, alterations of the  homeostasis mechanisms are relevant in the UC pathogenesis and steroid-requiring situation.© 2019 Japanese Society of Pathology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29877267>The Analysis of Renal Infiltrating Cells in Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis Induced by Anti-PD-1 Antibodies: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.</a></h2><p>Nivolumab is an anti-programmed  death-1 (PD-1) antibody that is utilized as an   inhibitor (ICI) for cancer therapy.

In addition to inherent properties of these lymphomas, their microenvironment also impacts on pathogenesis and response to therapy. An understanding of the milieu of T- and NK  lymphomas has important implications on treatment.Components of the microenvironment include tumour-associated macrophages (TAM), non-neoplastic T-cells and B-cells, eosinophils, dendritic cells, endothelial cells and blood vessels. TAM typically undergoes  polarization, promoting angiogenesis and inhibiting anti-tumour cellular immunity. In lymphomas of follicular helper T- derivation, increased B- proliferation occurs, which may in turn enhance neoplastic T- growth. The expression of   ligands on TAM, dendritic cells or lymphoma cells induces an immunosuppressive environment conducive to neoplastic proliferation. Strategies against this complex cellular and immunologic microenvironment have shown promises. These include the use of signal transduction inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies against chemokines or non-neoplastic microenvironmental cells, immunomodulatory drugs and   blockade. As T- and NK  lymphomas are highly heterogeneous, clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy of a given therapeutic approach requires careful design aiming at enriching patient populations who will best respond. Targeting of the immunologic milieu in T- and NK- lymphomas offers exciting challenges and opportunities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29780382>Extracellular Purine Metabolism Is the Switchboard of Immunosuppressive Macrophages and a Novel Target to Treat Diseases With Macrophage Imbalances.</a></h2><p>If misregulated, macrophage (Mϕ)-T  interactions can drive chronic inflammation thereby causing diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We report that in a proinflammatory environment, granulocyte-Mϕ (GM-CSF)- and Mϕ colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-dependent Mϕs have dichotomous effects on T  activity. While GM-CSF-dependent Mϕs show a highly stimulatory activity typical for M1 Mϕs, M-CSF-dependent Mϕs, marked by folate receptor β (FRβ), adopt an immunosuppressive  phenotype. We find the latter to be caused by the purinergic pathway that directs release of extracellular ATP and its conversion to immunosuppressive adenosine by co-expressed CD39 and CD73. Since we observed a misbalance between immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory Mϕs in human and murine arthritic joints, we devised a new strategy for RA treatment based on targeted delivery of a novel methotrexate (MTX) formulation to the immunosuppressive FRβCD39CD73 Mϕs, which boosts adenosine production and curtails the dominance of proinflammatory Mϕs. In contrast to untargeted MTX, this approach leads to potent alleviation of inflammation in the murine arthritis model. In conclusion, we define the Mϕ extracellular purine metabolism as a novel  in Mϕ  fate decision-making and an attractive target to control pathological Mϕs in -mediated diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25529917>CXCR4 inhibition in tumor microenvironment facilitates anti-programmed death receptor-1 immunotherapy in sorafenib-treated hepatocellular carcinoma in mice.</a></h2><p>Sorafenib, a broad tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is the only approved systemic therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but provides limited survival benefits. Recently, immunotherapy has emerged as a promising treatment strategy, but its role remains unclear in HCCs, which are associated with decreased cytotoxic CD8(+) T-lymphocyte infiltration in both murine and human tumors. Moreover, in mouse models after sorafenib treatment intratumoral hypoxia is increased and may fuel evasive resistance. Using orthotopic HCC models, we now show that increased hypoxia after sorafenib treatment promotes immunosuppression, characterized by increased intratumoral expression of the   inhibitor programmed death ligand-1 and accumulation of T-regulatory cells and -type macrophages. We also show that the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells is mediated in part by hypoxia-induced up-regulation of stromal -derived 1 alpha. Inhibition of the stromal -derived 1 alpha receptor (C-X-C receptor type 4 or CXCR4) using AMD3100 prevented the polarization toward an immunosuppressive microenvironment after sorafenib treatment, inhibited tumor growth, reduced lung metastasis, and improved survival. However, the combination of AMD3100 and sorafenib did not significantly change cytotoxic CD8(+) T-lymphocyte infiltration into HCC tumors and did not modify their activation status. In separate experiments, antibody blockade of the programmed death ligand-1 receptor programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) showed antitumor effects in treatment-naive tumors in orthotopic (grafted and genetically engineered) models of HCC. However, anti-PD-1 antibody treatment had additional antitumor activity only when combined with sorafenib and AMD3100 and not when combined with sorafenib alone.Anti-PD-1 treatment can boost antitumor  responses in HCC models; when used in combination with sorafenib, anti-PD-1 immunotherapy shows efficacy only with concomitant targeting of the hypoxic and immunosuppressive microenvironment with agents such as CXCR4 inhibitors.© 2014 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30345161>TLR7/8-agonist-loaded nanoparticles promote the polarization of tumour-associated macrophages to enhance cancer immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) are abundant in many cancers, and often display an -suppressive -like phenotype that fosters tumour growth and promotes resistance to therapy. Yet macrophages are highly plastic and can also acquire an anti-tumourigenic M1-like phenotype. Here, we show that R848, an agonist of the toll-like receptors (TLRs) TLR7 and TLR8 identified in a morphometric-based screen, is a potent driver of the M1 phenotype in vitro and that R848-loaded β-cyclodextrin nanoparticles (CDNPs) lead to efficient drug delivery to TAMs in vivo. As a monotherapy, the administration of CDNP-R848 in multiple tumour models in mice altered the functional orientation of the tumour  microenvironment towards an M1 phenotype, leading to controlled tumour growth and protecting the animals against tumour rechallenge. When used in combination with the   inhibitor anti-PD-1, we observed improved immunotherapy response rates, also in a tumour model resistant to anti-PD-1 therapy. Our findings demonstrate the ability of rationally engineered drug-nanoparticle combinations to efficiently modulate TAMs for cancer immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26425658>How to target small  lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Small  lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly malignant disease with dismal prognosis. Although great progress has been made in investigating genetic aberrations and putative drivers of this tumor entity, the mechanisms of rapid dissemination and acquisition of drug resistance are not clear. The majority of SCLC cases are characterized by inactivation of the tumor suppressors p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) and, therefore, interchangeable drivers will be difficult to target successfully. Access to pure cultures of SCLC circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and study of their tumor biology has revealed a number of new potential targets. Most important, expression of chitinase-3-like-1/YKL-40 (CHI3L1) which controls expression of vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) was newly described in these cells. The process switching CHI3L1-negative SCLC cells to CHI3L1-positive CTCs seems to be associated with cytokines released by inflammatory  cells. Furthermore, these CTCs were found to promote monocyte-macrophage differentiation, most likely of the  tumor-promoting type, recently described to express PD-1   antigen in SCLC. In conclusion, dissemination of SCLC seems to be linked to conversion of regular tumor cells to highly invasive CHI3L1-positive CTCs, which are protected by  system suppression. Besides the classical targets VEGF, MMP-9 and PD-1, CHI3L1 constitutes a new possibly drugable molecule to retard down dissemination of SCLC cells, which may be similarly relevant for glioblastoma and other tumor entities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581535>STAT3 Activity Promotes Programmed-Death Ligand 1 Expression and Suppresses  Responses in Breast Cancer.</a></h2><p>Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is an oncogene and multifaceted transcription factor involved in multiple cellular functions. Its role in modifying anti-tumor immunity has been recently recognized. In this study, the biologic effects of STAT3 on   expression and anti-tumor responses were investigated in breast cancer (BC). A transcriptional signature of phosphorylated STAT3 was positively correlated with PD-L1 expression in two independent cohorts of early BC. Pharmacologic inhibition and gene silencing of  led to decreased Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels in vitro, and resulted as well in reduction of tumor growth and decreased metastatic dissemination in a mammary carcinoma mouse model. The hampering of tumor progression was correlated to an anti-tumoral macrophage phenotype and accumulation of natural-killer cells, but also in reduced accrual of cytotoxic lymphocytes. In human BC, pro-tumoral macrophages correlated to PD-L1 expression, proliferation status and higher grade of malignancy, indicating a subset of patients with immunosuppressive properties. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for STAT3-mediated regulation of PD-L1 and modulation of  microenvironment in BC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30999958>Treatment of malignant pleural effusions: the case for localized immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Malignant pleural effusions (MPE) are a common terminal pathway for many cancers, with an estimated United States incidence of more than 150,000 cases per year. MPE is an aggressive disease with a uniformly fatal prognosis and a life expectancy of only 3 to 12 months. The development of an effective targeted therapy represents a pressing unmet need. This commentary focuses on how cellular and humoral components condition the pleural space as a tumor-promoting, wound-healing environment. Despite an abundance of potential antigen presenting and effector cells in the pleura, their physical isolation by the mesothelial barrier, the concentration of cytokines and chemokines driving the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and  /Th-2 polarization, suppress tumor-specific  effector responses. We argue that local  repolarization must precede either   or cellular therapy to successfully eradicate pleural tumor. We further hypothesize that, because of its cellular content, a repolarized pleural space will provide an effective  environment for generation of systemic anti-tumor response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31036756>Genomic testing, tumor microenvironment and targeted therapy of Hedgehog-related human cancers.</a></h2><p>Hedgehog signals are transduced through Patched receptors to the Smoothened (SMO)-SUFU-GLI and SMO-Gi-RhoA signaling cascades. MTOR-S6K1 and MEK-ERK signals are also transduced to GLI activators through post-translational modifications. The GLI transcription network up-regulates target genes, such as  and , in a cellular context-dependent manner. Aberrant Hedgehog signaling in tumor cells leads to self-renewal, survival, proliferation and invasion. Paracrine Hedgehog signaling in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which harbors cancer-associated fibroblasts, leads to angiogenesis, fibrosis,  evasion and neuropathic pain. Hedgehog-related genetic alterations occur frequently in basal  carcinoma (BCC) (85%) and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)-subgroup medulloblastoma (87%) and less frequently in breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-small- lung cancer (NSCLC) and ovarian cancer. Among investigational SMO inhibitors, vismodegib and sonidegib are approved for the treatment of patients with BCC, and glasdegib is approved for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Resistance to SMO inhibitors is caused by acquired  mutations,  deletions,  amplification, other by-passing mechanisms of GLI activation and WNT/β-catenin signaling activation. GLI-DNA-interaction inhibitors (glabrescione B and GANT61), GLI2 destabilizers (arsenic trioxide and pirfenidone) and a GLI-deacetylation inhibitor (4SC-202) were shown to block GLI-dependent transcription and tumorigenesis in preclinical studies. By contrast, SMO inhibitors can remodel the immunosuppressive TME that is dominated by -like tumor-associated macrophages (-TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, and thus, a Phase I/II clinical trial of the   inhibitor pembrolizumab with or without vismodegib in BCC patients is ongoing.© 2019 The Author(s).

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), macrophage type 2 () cells, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) could make immunologic barriers against CD8  T -mediated antitumor  responses. Thus, CD8  T cells are needed to be primed and activated toward effector CTLs in a process called tumor immunity  for making durable and efficient antitumor  responses. The CD8  T  priming is directed essentially as a corroboration work between cells of innate immunity including dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells with CD4  T cells in adoptive immunity. Upon activation, effector CTLs infiltrate to the core or invading site of the tumor (so-called infiltrated-inflamed [I-I] TME) and take essential roles for killing cancer cells.

Nevertheless, the superiority of single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in pretreated EGFR mutant patients has turned out to be moderate. One proposed mechanism for poor response to   inhibitors is an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Therefore, we utilized two autochthonous EGFR-driven lung tumor models to investigate dynamic microenvironmental responses to EGFR-TKI treatment. We observed that at an early stage, sensitive EGFR-TKIs caused obvious tumor shrinkage accompanied by increased cytotoxic CD8 T cells and dendritic cells, eradication of Foxp3 Tregs, and inhibition of -like polarization of macrophages. However, the tumor microenvironmental changes that may be most beneficial for combination treatment with -mediated anticancer approaches were only temporary and disappeared as treatment continued. Meanwhile, the level of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), particularly mononuclear MDSCs, was consistently elevated throughout the treatment. Analysis of inflammatory factors in serum showed that EGFR-TKIs increased the levels of IL-10 and CCL-2. Our study systematically analyzed dynamic changes in tumor microenvironments responding to EGFR-TKIs in vivo. The results have implications for combination therapy using EGFR-TKIs. The optimal sequence of the treatment and strategies that modulate the tumor microenvironment to a state that may favor antitumor  responses need to be considered when designing clinical trials.© 2019 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30133260>M1 Macrophage-Derived Nanovesicles Potentiate the Anticancer Efficacy of   Inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Cancer immunotherapy modulates  cells to induce antitumor  responses. Tumors employ   to evade   attacks.   inhibitors such as anti-PD-L1 antibody (aPD-L1), which is being used clinically for cancer treatments, can block   so that the  system can attack tumors. However,   inhibitor therapy may be hampered by polarization of macrophages within the tumor microenvironment (TME) into  tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which suppress antitumor  responses and promote tumor growth by releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors. In this study, we used exosome-mimetic nanovesicles derived from M1 macrophages (M1NVs) to repolarize  TAMs to M1 macrophages that release pro-inflammatory cytokines and induce antitumor  responses and investigated whether the macrophage repolarization can potentiate the anticancer efficacy of aPD-L1. M1NV treatment induced successful polarization of  macrophages to M1 macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Intravenous injection of M1NVs into tumor-bearing mice suppressed tumor growth. Importantly, injection of a combination of M1NVs and aPD-L1 further reduced the tumor size, compared to the injection of either M1NVs or aPD-L1 alone. Thus, our study indicates that M1NV injection can repolarize  TAMs to M1 macrophages and potentiate antitumor efficacy of the  inhibitor therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29308311>Increased infiltration of -macrophages, T-cells and PD-L1 expression in high grade leiomyosarcomas supports immunotherapeutic strategies.</a></h2><p> Immunotherapy may be a rational strategy in leiomyosarcoma (LMS), a tumor known for its genomic complexity. As a prerequisite for therapeutic applications, we characterized the  microenvironment in LMS, as well as its prognostic value.  CD163 macrophages, CD3 T-cells, PD-L1/PD-L2 and HLA class I expression (HCA2, HC10 and β2m) were evaluated using immunohistochemistry in primary tumors (n = 75), local relapses (n = 6) and metastases (n = 19) of 87 LMS patients, as well as in benign leiomyomas (n = 7). Correlation with clinicopathological parameters and survival analyses were assessed. Effect of LMS cells on macrophage differentiation was investigated using coculture of CD14 monocytes with LMS  lines or their conditioned media (CM).  58% and 52% of the tumors were highly infiltrated with CD163 macrophages and T-cells, respectively, with HLA class I expression observed in almost all tumors and PD-L1 expression in 30%. PD-L2 expression was also detected in some PD-L1 tumors. All these  markers correlated with high tumor grade but only CD163 associated with overall survival ( = 0.003) and disease-specific survival ( = 0.041). , CD163 was upregulated in the presence of LMS cells producing M-CSF, suggesting that this tumor drives macrophages towards the  phenotype.  The clinical significance of  macrophages, possibly induced by LMS -secreted factors, suggests that 2/3 of high-grade LMS patients might benefit from macrophage-targeting agents. Furthermore, PD-L1 expression together with high T- infiltrate and HLA class I expression in around 30% of high grade LMS reflects an active  microenvironment potentially responsive to   inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29533731>Engineering Vaccines to Reprogram Immunity against Head and Neck Cancer.</a></h2><p>The recent Food and Drug Administration's approval of monoclonal antibodies targeting   receptors (ICRs) for recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous  carcinoma (HNSCC) offers exciting promise to improve patient outcome and reduce morbidities. A favorable response to ICR blockade relies on an extensive collection of preexisting tumor-specific T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). ICR blockade reinvigorates exhausted CD8 T cells and enhances  killing. However, resistance to ICR blockade is observed in about 85% of patients with HNSCC, therefore highlighting the importance of characterizing the mechanisms underlying HNSCC  escape and exploring combinatorial strategies to sensitize hypoimmunogenic cold HNSCC to ICR inhibition. Cancer vaccines are designed to bypass the cold TME and directly deliver cancer antigens to antigen-presenting cells (APCs); these vaccines epitomize a priming strategy to synergize with ICR inhibitors. Cancer cells are ineffective antigen presenters, and poor APC infiltration as well as the -like polarization in the TME further dampens antigen uptake and processing, both of which render ineffective innate and adaptive  detection. Cancer vaccines directly activate APC and expand the tumor-specific T- repertoire. In addition, cancer vaccines often contain an adjuvant, which further improves APC function, promotes epitope spreading, and augments host intrinsic antitumor immunity. Thus, the vaccine-induced  priming generates a pool of effectors whose function can be enhanced by ICR inhibitors. In this review, we summarize the major HNSCC  evasion strategies, the ongoing effort toward improving HNSCC vaccines, and the current challenges limiting the efficacy of cancer vaccines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659256>Listeria-based hepatocellular carcinoma vaccine facilitates anti-PD-1 therapy by regulating macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>Recently, patients with advanced cancers have been benefited greatly from   blockade immunotherapy. However,   blockade is still suboptimal in HCC treatment and more  modifications are needed to achieve an efficient therapeutic goal. Here, we investigated the combined administration of a Listeria-based HCC vaccine, Lmdd-MPFG, and the anti-PD-1   blockade antibody. We found that Lmdd-MPFG promoted the expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells but resensitized the tumor local T  to respond to the anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Mechanistically, the Lmdd-MPFG vaccine activates the NF-κB pathway in the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) through the TLR2 and MyD88 pathway, and recruits p62 to activate the autophagy pathway. The overall effect is skewing the TAMs from -polarized TAMs into the M1-polarized TAMs. Most importantly, it skewed the cytokine profiles into antitumor one in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This change restores the T- reactivity to the anti-PD-1 blockade. Our results suggested that Lmdd-MPFG combined with PD-1 blockade exerted synergistic antitumor effects through modifying TAMs in the TME and removing T- inhibitory signals, thereby providing a new potential strategy for HCC treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524879>PD-L1 expression with -infiltrate evaluation and outcome prediction in melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab.</a></h2><p>: Tumor microenvironment may have a key role in providing immunological markers that can help predict clinical response to treatment with  inhibitors. We investigated whether the baseline expression of PD-L1 in advanced melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab may correlate with clinical outcome. : PD-L1 expression was assessed in 114 patients with advanced melanoma treated with ipilimumab and, in a cohort of 77 patients, a comprehensive assessment using multispectral imaging to assess the presence and distribution of CD3+, CD8+, CD163+, FOXP3+ and PD-L1+ cells inside and at periphery of the tumor was performed. : PD-L1 status alone was not a predictive biomarker for response or survival. There was an association between clinical benefit from ipilimumab therapy with the coexistence of low densities of CD8+ and high densities of CD163+ PD-L1+ cells at the periphery of the tumor. : To explain the association of this peculiar microenvironment with clinical benefit from ipilimumab, we proposed a model where baseline CD8 cells levels are low due to inhibitory effect of Tregs and to pro-tumor activity of TAM  (CD163+ PD-L1+ cells). Ipilimumab treatment causes a decrease of Treg cells, mediated by ADCC from macrophages, with a concomitant change in TAM polarization that switches from  to M1 with a subsequent attraction of CD8 cells and the increase of antitumor response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31214202>Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells: Key Drivers of Immunosuppression in Ovarian Cancer.</a></h2><p>The presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is associated with a longer overall survival in advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer. Despite the prognostic impact of TILs, response to -inhibitors and antigen-specific active immunotherapy is limited in ovarian cancer. The goal of our study was to investigate the interaction between ovarian cancer and the innate and adaptive  system in the ID8-fLuc syngeneic ovarian cancer mouse model. For the  experiments C57BL/6, B6.129S7-Rag1/J, and B6.129P2(SJL)-Myd88/J mice were inoculated with ID8-fLuc.  depletion experiments were performed using clodronate liposomes (CL), anti-CD8a, anti-GR1, anti-colony stimulating factor 1 (anti-CSF1), and TMβ1 (anti-CD122).  read out was performed by fluorescent activated  sorting analysis for effector T cells, regulatory T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, macrophages, and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), immunohistochemistry for MDSC and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and immunofluorescence for M1 and  TAM in the vascular context. The effect of MDSC on T  proliferation and phenotype were studied . We discovered that the absence of T and B cells did not influence tumor growth or survival of B6.129S7-Rag1/J mice compared to immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice. CL-induced macrophage depletion promoted tumor proliferation and shortened survival in C57BL/6 mice ( = 0.004) and in B6.129S7-Rag1/J mice ( = 0.0005). During CL treatment, we observed a clear increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( ≤ 0.02) and monocytic MDSC ( ≤ 0.01). Selective depletion of MDSC by anti-GR1 improved survival, certainly in comparison to mice treated with anti-CSF1 ( = 0.01-median survival 91 vs. 67.5 days). B6.129P2(SJL)-Myd88/J mice displayed to a longer median survival compared to C57BL/6 mice (90 vs. 76 days). MDSC activated by ID8-fLuc conditioned medium or ascites of tumor-bearing mice showed T  suppressive functions . Based on these findings, we conclude that the adaptive  system does not efficiently control tumor growth in the ID8-fLuc model. In addition, we discovered a prominent role for MDSC as the driver of immunosuppression in the ID8-fLuc ovarian cancer mouse model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791466>Mouse-Derived Isograft (MDI) In Vivo Tumor Models I. Spontaneous sMDI Models: Characterization and Cancer Therapeutic Approaches.</a></h2><p>Syngeneic in vivo tumor models are valuable for the development and investigation of -modulating anti-cancer drugs. In the present study, we established a novel syngeneic in vivo model type named mouse-derived isografts (MDIs). Spontaneous MDIs (sMDIs) were obtained during a long-term observation period (more than one to two years) of naïve and untreated animals of various mouse strains (C3H/HeJ, CBA/J, DBA/2N, BALB/c, and C57BL/6N). Primary tumors or suspicious tissues were assessed macroscopically and re-transplanted in a PDX-like manner as small tumor pieces into sex-matched syngeneic animals. Nine outgrowing primary tumors were histologically characterized either as adenocarcinomas, histiocytic carcinomas, or lymphomas. Growth of the tumor pieces after re-transplantation displayed model heterogeneity. The adenocarcinoma sMDI model JA-0009 was further characterized by flow cytometry, RNA-sequencing, and efficacy studies.  macrophages were found to be the main tumor infiltrating leukocyte population, whereas only a few T cells were observed. JA-0009 showed limited sensitivity when treated with antibodies against inhibitory  molecules (anti-mPD-1 and anti-mCTLA-4), but high sensitivity to gemcitabine treatment. The generated sMDI are spontaneously occurring tumors of low passage number, propagated as tissue pieces in mice without any tissue culturing, and thus conserving the original tumor characteristics and intratumoral   populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27245147>FGFR inhibitors: Effects on cancer cells, tumor microenvironment and whole-body homeostasis (Review).</a></h2><p>Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)2, FGF4, FGF7 and FGF20 are representative paracrine FGFs binding to heparan-sulfate proteoglycan and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), whereas FGF19, FGF21 and FGF23 are endocrine FGFs binding to Klotho and FGFRs. FGFR1 is relatively frequently amplified and overexpressed in breast and lung cancer, and FGFR2 in gastric cancer. BCR-FGFR1, CNTRL-FGFR1, CUX1-FGFR1, FGFR1OP-FGFR1, MYO18A-FGFR1 and ZMYM2-FGFR1 fusions in myeloproliferative neoplasms are non-receptor-type FGFR kinases, whereas FGFR1-TACC1, FGFR2-AFF3, FGFR2-BICC1, FGFR2-PPHLN1, FGFR3-BAIAP2L1 and FGFR3-TACC3 fusions in solid tumors are transmembrane-type FGFRs with C-terminal alterations. AZD4547, BGJ398 (infigratinib), Debio-1347 and dovitinib are FGFR1/2/3 inhibitors; BLU9931 is a selective FGFR4 inhibitor; FIIN-2, JNJ-42756493, LY2874455 and ponatinib are pan-FGFR inhibitors. AZD4547, dovitinib and ponatinib are multi-kinase inhibitors targeting FGFRs, colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)R2, and others. The tumor microenvironment consists of cancer cells and stromal/ cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells, -type tumor-associating macrophages (-TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells. FGFR inhibitors elicit antitumor effects directly on cancer cells, as well as indirectly through the blockade of paracrine signaling. The dual inhibition of FGF and CSF1 or VEGF signaling is expected to enhance the antitumor effects through the targeting of  evasion and angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment. Combination therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (FGFR or CSF1R inhibitors) and   blockers (anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies) may be a promising choice for cancer patients. The inhibition of FGF19-FGFR4 signaling is associated with a risk of liver toxicity, whereas the activation of FGF23-FGFR4 signaling is associated with a risk of heart toxicity. Endocrine FGF signaling affects the pathophysiology of cancer patients who are prescribed FGFR inhibitors. Whole-genome sequencing is necessary for the detection of promoter/enhancer alterations of FGFR genes and rare alterations of other genes causing FGFR overexpression.

As the most abundant  cells in TME, tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play nonredundant roles in restricting antitumor immunity. The leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 4 (Lgr4, also known as Gpr48) has been associated with multiple physiologic and pathologic functions. Lgr4 and its ligands R-spondin 1-4 have been shown to promote the growth and metastasis of tumor cells. However, whether Lgr4 can promote tumor progression by regulating the function of  cells in the tumor microenvironment remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Lgr4 promotes macrophage  polarization through Rspo/Lgr4/Erk/Stat3 signaling. Notably, urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), and B16F10 melanoma tumors were all markedly reduced in Lgr4Lyz2 mice, characterized by fewer protumoral  TAMs and increased CD8 T lymphocyte infiltration in the TME. Furthermore, LLC tumor growth was greatly depressed when Rspo/Lgr4/Erk/Stat3 signaling was blocked with either the LGR4 extracellular domain or an anti-Rspo1 antibody. Importantly, blocking Rspo-Lgr4 signaling overcame LLC resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy and improved the efficacy of PD-1 immunotherapy against B16F10 melanoma, indicating vital roles of Rspo-Lgr4 in host antitumor immunity and a potential therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy. This study identifies a novel receptor as a critical switch in TAM polarization whose inhibition sensitizes  therapy-resistant lung cancer to anti-PD-1 therapy. http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/17/4929/F1.large.jpg .©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30206165>Antibody-Fc/FcR Interaction on Macrophages as a Mechanism for Hyperprogressive Disease in Non-small  Lung Cancer Subsequent to PD-1/PD-L1 Blockade.</a></h2><p>Hyperprogression (HP), a paradoxical boost in tumor growth, was described in a subset of patients treated with   inhibitors (ICI). Neither clinicopathologic features nor biological mechanisms associated with HP have been identified.Among 187 patients with non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with ICI at our institute, cases with HP were identified according to clinical and radiologic criteria. Baseline histologic samples from patients treated with ICI were evaluated by IHC for myeloid and lymphoid markers.

The  microenvironment was evaluated by flow cytometry and IHC.Among 187 patients, 152 were evaluable for clinical response. We identified four categories: 32 cases were defined as responders (21%), 42 patients with stable disease (27.7%), 39 cases were defined as progressors (25.7%), and 39 patients with HP (25.7%). Pretreatment tissue samples from all patients with HP showed tumor infiltration by -like CD163CD33PD-L1 clustered epithelioid macrophages.

In these models, tumor growth was enhanced by treatment with anti-PD-1 but not anti-PD-1 F(ab) fragments.These results suggest a crucial role of TAM reprogramming, upon Fc receptor engagement by ICI, eventually inducing HP and provide clues on a distinctive immunophenotype potentially able to predict HP..©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31331345>Subtyping of microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>Patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal cancer (CRC) generally have a better prognosis than patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC. However, some MSI-H CRC patients do not gain overall survival benefits from  -blockade treatment. In other words, heterogeneity within the subgroup of MSI-H tumors remains poorly understood. Thus, an in-depth molecular characterization of MSI-H tumors is urgently required.Here, we use nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)-based consensus clustering to define CRC MSI-H subtypes in The Cancer Genome Atlas and a French multicenter cohort GSE39582. CIBERSORT was used to calculate the proportions of 22 lymphocytes in tumor tissue in MSI-H subtypes.MSI-H CRC samples basically clustered into two subgroups (MSI-H1 and MSI-H2). MSI-H1 was characterized by a lower BRAF mutational status, higher frequency of chromosomal instability, global hypomethylation, and worse survival than MSI-H2. Further examination of the  landscape showed that macrophages of the  phenotype were enriched in MSI-H1, which may be associated with poor prognosis in this subgroup.Our results illustrate the genetic heterogeneity in MSI-H CRCs and macrophages may serve as good targets for anticancer therapy in MSI-H1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379842>M1 Macrophages Induce PD-L1 Expression in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells Through IL-1β Signaling.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prototype of inflammation-related cancer, harboring M1-like and -like tumor-associated macrophages. M1 macrophages are thought to be tumoricidal, but some studies report its pro-tumor role. The programmed  death-ligand (PD-L) 1 expressed in HCC cells is a critical  molecule to mediate  escape of HCC. The PD-L1 expression in HCC cells is inducible. In the present study, we ask whether M1 macrophages induce the expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells. First, an association between M1 macrophage infiltration and PD-L1 expression in HCC tissues was determined by bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry experiments. The enrichment score of M1 macrophages was correlated to PD-L1 expression in 90 HCC samples from GEO database. Besides, infiltration of CD68+HLA-DR+ M1-like macrophages correlated with PD-L1 expression level in HCC cells. Moreover, M1-conditioned media was prepared from M1 macrophages derived from THP-1 , RAW264.7  or murine bone marrow. These supernatants induced expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in the supernatants was identified to account for the inducible PD-L1 expression by siRNA assay and receptor blockade assay. Additionally, transcription factor p65 and IRF1 in the HCC cells were revealed by CHIP assay to mediate the inducible PD-L1 expression. All the results demonstrate that M1 macrophages induced expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells, supporting the pro-tumor role of M1 macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29410946>Tumor-Associated Macrophages: Therapeutic Targets for Skin Cancer.</a></h2><p>Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) are significant components of the microenvironment of solid tumors in the majority of cancers. TAMs sequentially develop from monocytes into functional macrophages. In each differentiation stage, TAMs obtain various immunosuppressive functions to maintain the tumor microenvironment (e.g., expression of   molecules, production of Treg-related chemokines and cytokines, production of arginase I). Although the main population of TAMs is immunosuppressive  macrophages, TAMs can be modulated into M1-type macrophages in each differential stage, leading to the suppression of tumor growth. Because the administration of certain drugs or stromal factors can stimulate TAMs to produce specific chemokines, leading to the recruitment of various tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, TAMs can serve as targets for cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we discuss the differentiation, activation, and immunosuppressive function of TAMs, as well as their benefits in cancer immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447857>The Human G Protein-Coupled ATP Receptor P2Y Is Associated With IL-10 Driven Macrophage Differentiation.</a></h2><p>The G protein-coupled P2Y receptor is known to sense extracellular ATP during inflammatory and  responses. The dinucleotide NAD has also been proposed to be a P2Y receptor ligand but its role is less clear. Here, we have examined for the first time human P2Y receptor protein levels and show that the receptor was upregulated during polarization of  macrophages. IL-10 reinforced P2Y receptor expression during differentiation of M2c macrophages expressing CD163, CD16, and CD274 (PD-L1). Nutlin-3a mediated p53 stabilization further increased P2Y receptor, CD16, and PD-L1 expression. AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), which mediates anti-inflammatory effects of IL-10, and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme of the NAD salvage pathway, which is under the control of AMPK, were also required for P2Y receptor expression. The P2Y receptor agonist ATPγS and NAD could independently stimulate the production of IL-8 in  macrophages, however, only the ATPγS-induced response was mediated by P2Y receptor. Both in a recombinant system and in macrophages, P2Y receptor-driven IL-8 production predominantly depended on IkB kinase (IKK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). In conclusion, our data indicate that an AMPK-NAMPT-NAD signaling axis promotes P2Y receptor expression during  polarization of human macrophages in response to IL-10. PD-L1 expressing M2c macrophages that secrete the cancer-promoting chemokine IL-8 in response to P2Y receptor stimulation may represent an important target in  blockade immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609000>Molecular and clinical characterization of Galectin-9 in glioma through 1,027 samples.</a></h2><p>In recent years, research on glioma immunotherapy have grown rapidly. However, the autoimmune-like side effects that are caused by blocking immunological  hinder their clinical application in gliomas currently. Galectin-9, a ligand for T- immunoglobulin mucin 3, has shed a new light on the treatment of malignant glioma. However, the potential mechanism of Galectin-9 is still under discussion. In this study, first, we methodically gathered 1,027 glioma patients with RNA-seq and 986 patients with survival data to explore the role and mechanism of Galectin-9 in gliomas. Second, we analyzed glioma samples from 50 patients in the Department of Neurosurgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital. Finally, we found that Galectin-9 was strongly upregulated in glioblastoma multiforme compared with normal brain tissues and lower-grade glioma. Patients with Galectin-9 overexpression had a significantly shorter overall survival. Moreover, the tissue microarray data displayed that the expression of Galectin-9 in the core of tumor is higher than that in the border and was correlated with the shorter survival in glioma patients. Galectin-9 is more highly expressed in the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma multiforme than in the other subtypes. Simultaneously, Galectin-9 was closely associated with the  response and lymphocyte activation, especially T- activation. To further determine the underlying role of Galectin-9 in the  response, we selected seven  metagenes. Through cluster analysis and correlation analysis, we discovered that Galectin-9 was highly correlated with   molecules and  tumor-associated macrophages. In summary, Galectin-9 serves as a potential therapeutic target to treat glioblastoma multiforme.© 2019 The Authors.

Herein, we aimed to examine the expression of programmed  death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and related proteins in MSI-H and microsatellite-stable (MSS) CRCs to investigate the  microenvironment at the tumor's invasive front. The MSI status was retrospectively assessed in 499 patients undergoing surgical resection of primary CRC; of these, 48 were classified as MSI-H. Propensity score matching was performed, and tissues from 36 and 37 patients with MSI-H and MSS CRCs, respectively, were immunohistochemically evaluated for PD-L1, PD-1, CD8 and CD68. PD-L1 expression was evaluated separately for tumor cells (PD-L1 [T]) and tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells in the stroma (PD-L1 [I]). PD-L1 (T) was positive in only 5.4% and 36.1% of MSS and MSI-H CRCs, while PD-L1 (I) was positive in 27% and 72.2% of these CRCs, respectively. The PD-L1 (T) and PD-L1 (I) expression levels in MSI-H CRCs significantly correlated with poor differentiation, lymphatic invasion and vascular invasion (p < 0.05), and with early-stage adenocarcinoma and high budding grade (p < 0.05), respectively. Significantly more PD-L1 (I), CD8-positive cells and CD68-positive macrophages were present at the invasive front than in the central tumor in MSI-H CRCs (p < 0.005). PD-L1 was expressed on both tumor cells and CD68/CD163-positive () macrophages at the invasive front of MSI-H CRCs. In conclusion, PD-L1-positive tumor cells and -type tumor-associated macrophages may contribute to tumor invasion and  escape at the invasive front.© 2017 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30931508>Hypoxia as a barrier to immunotherapy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal disease with limited response to cytotoxic chemoradiotherapy, as well as newer immunotherapies. The PDA tumor microenvironment contains infiltrating  cells including cytotoxic T cells; however, there is an overall immunosuppressive milieu. Hypoxia is a known element of the solid tumor microenvironment and may promote tumor survival. Through various mechanisms including, but not limited to, those mediated by HIF-1α, hypoxia also leads to increased tumor proliferation and metabolic changes. Furthermore, epithelial to mesenchymal transition is promoted through several pathways, including NOTCH and c-MET, regulated by hypoxia. Hypoxia-promoted changes also contribute to the immunosuppressive phenotype seen in many different  types within the microenvironment and thereby may inhibit an effective  system response to PDA. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and myofibroblasts appear to contribute to the recruitment of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and B cells in PDA via cytokines increased due to hypoxia. PSCs also increase collagen secretion in response to HIF-1α, which promotes a fibrotic stroma that alters T  homing and migration. In hypoxic environments, B cells contribute to cytotoxic T  exhaustion and produce chemokines to attract more immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. MDSCs inhibit T  metabolism by hoarding key amino acids, modulate T  homing by cleaving L-selectin, and prevent T  activation by increasing PD-L1 expression. Immunosuppressive  phenotype macrophages promote T  anergy via increased nitric oxide (NO) and decreased arginine in hypoxia. Increased numbers of regulatory T cells are seen in hypoxia which prevent effector T  activation through cytokine production and increased CTLA-4. Effective immunotherapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and other solid tumors will need to help counteract the immunosuppressive nature of hypoxia-induced changes in the tumor microenvironment. Promising studies will look at combination therapies involving  inhibitors, chemokine inhibitors, and possible targeting of hypoxia. While no model is perfect, assuring that models incorporate the effects of hypoxia on cancer cells, stromal cells, and effector  cells will be crucial in developing successful therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31170995>Immunologic cellular characteristics of the tumour microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma drive patient outcomes.</a></h2><p>Anti-tumour  competence has an impact in hepatocarcinogenesis and success of anti-cancer therapies. Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and monocytes/macrophages (TAMs) are proposed to have significance in cancer.

Cancers harness the  regulatory mechanism that prevents autoimmunity from evading immunosurveillance and promoting  destruction. Regulatory T cells, myeloid suppressor cells, inhibitory cytokines and   receptors are the major components of the  system acting in concert with cancer cells and causing the subversion of anti-tumor immunity. This redundant immunosuppressive network poses an impediment to efficacious immunotherapy by facilitating tumor progression. Tumor-associated myeloid cells comprise heterogeneous populations acting systemically (myeloid-derived suppressor cells/MDSCs) and/or locally in the tumor microenvironment (MDSCs and tumor-associated macrophages/TAMs). Both populations promote cancer  proliferation and survival, angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and elicit immunosuppression through different pathways, including the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines and  inhibitors. Several evidences have demonstrated that myeloid cells can express different functional programs in response to different microenvironmental signals, a property defined as functional plasticity. The opposed extremes of this functional flexibility are generally represented by the classical macrophage activation, which identifies inflammatory and cytotoxic M1 polarized macrophages, and the alternative state of macrophage activation, which identifies  polarized anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive macrophages. Functional skewing of myeloid cells occurs in vivo under physiological and pathological conditions, including cancer and autoimmunity. Here we discuss how myeloid suppressor cells can on one hand support tumor growth and, on the other, limit autoimmune responses, indicating that their therapeutic reprogramming can generate opportunities in relieving immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment or reinstating tolerance in autoimmune conditions.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, the understanding of the complex interplay between the various types of bystander cells and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells is incomplete. Numerous studies have indicated that bystander cells provide chronic lymphocytic leukemia-supportive functions, but it has also become clear that chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells actively engage in the formation of a supportive tumor microenvironment through several cross-talk mechanisms. In this review, we describe how chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells participate in this interplay by inducing migration and tumor-supportive differentiation of bystander cells. Furthermore, chronic lymphocytic leukemia-mediated alterations in the interactions between bystander cells are discussed. Upon bystander  interaction, chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells secrete cytokines and chemokines such as migratory factors [chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 22 and chemokine (CC motif) ligand 2], which result in further recruitment of T cells but also of monocyte-derived cells. Within the tumor microenvironment, chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells induce differentiation towards a tumor-supportive  phenotype of monocyte-derived cells and suppress phagocytosis, but also induce increased numbers of supportive regulatory T cells. Like other tumor types, the differentiation of stromal cells towards supportive cancer-associated fibroblasts is critically dependent on chronic lymphocytic leukemia-derived factors such as exosomes and platelet-derived growth factor. Lastly, both chronic lymphocytic leukemia and bystander cells induce a tolerogenic tumor microenvironment; chronic lymphocytic leukemia-secreted cytokines, such as interleukin-10, suppress cytotoxic T- functions, while chronic lymphocytic leukemia-associated monocyte-derived cells contribute to suppression of T- function by producing the   factor, programmed  death-ligand 1. Deeper understanding of the active involvement and cross-talk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in shaping the tumor microenvironment may offer novel clues for designing therapeutic strategies.Copyright© 2017 Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31524529>The sialoglycan-Siglec glyco-  - a target for improving innate and adaptive anti-cancer immunity.</a></h2><p>: During cancer progression, tumor cells develop several mechanisms to prevent killing and to shape the  system into a tumor-promoting environment.

Herein, suppressive  cells and inhibitory factors secreted by the tumor itself play a central role.In the present study we show that the Treg activation marker GARP (glycoprotein A repetitions predominant), known to induce peripheral tolerance in a TGF-β dependent way, is also expressed on human primary melanoma. Interestingly, membrane bound GARP is shed from the surface of both, activated Treg and melanoma cells, and, in its soluble form (sGARP), not only induces peripheral Treg but also a tumor associated () macrophage phenotype. Notably, proliferation of cytotoxic T cells and their effector function is inhibited in the presence of sGARP. GARP expression on Treg and melanoma cells is significantly decreased in the presence of agents such as IFN-α, thus explaining at least in part a novel mechanism of action of this adjuvant therapy.In conclusion, GARP in its soluble and membrane bound form contributes to peripheral tolerance in a multipronged way, potentiates the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and thus acts as a negative regulator in melanoma patients. Therefore, it may qualify as a promising target and a new  for cancer immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27910859>T- programming in pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a review.</a></h2><p>Despite recent advancements in multimodal therapy, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) continues to have a dismal prognosis. In the era of burgeoning  therapies against previously difficult-to-treat malignancies, there has been growing interest in activating the  system against PDA; however, unlike in other cancers such as melanoma and lymphoma, immunotherapy has not yielded many clinically significant results. To harness these mechanisms for therapeutic use, an in-depth understanding of T- programming in the  microenvironment of PDA must be achieved. The outcome of T- programming against pathogens or cancer depends on the uptake and presentation of foreign antigens by dendritic cells and macrophages to T cells, and the expression of various co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines. Subsequent  responses are kept in check via regulatory mechanisms such as   (for example, programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4)), as well as other immunosuppressive  types such as regulatory T cells (T) and  macrophages. PDA presents a challenge from the perspective of  therapy because of many immunosuppressive mechanisms at play in its microenvironment. The tumor itself produces IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) that downregulate T- activation as well as the activity of antigen-presenting cells. At the same time, PDA also appears to recruit more regulatory elements into its milieu; higher infiltration of T, for instance, has been associated with poorer prognosis in PDA patients.  macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressive cells are also highly prevalent in the tumor microenvironment. T cells in PDA have high expression of PD-1, whereas the tumor has high expression of PD-L1, which likely inhibits activation of tumor antigen-specific T cells. Many of these immunosuppressive mechanisms have been targeted as potential  therapies of PDA.   inhibitors, which target PD-1 and CTLA-4, have been shown to be effective in other cancers such as melanoma; however, they have not demonstrated outcome benefits in PDA so far. Other novel investigational approaches under study currently include inhibiting the homing of immunosuppressive  types to the tumor milieu, as well as vaccines designed to boost the adaptive response to PDA antigens. As our understanding of the nuanced and complex interactions of the  microenvironment expands, more targeted approaches can be taken toward achieving therapeutic success in  therapy against PDA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28950145>Determination of poor prognostic  features of tumour microenvironment in non-smoking patients with lung adenocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>We have previously demonstrated that the prognostic significance of tumour-infiltrating CD8 T cells significantly differs according to histological type and patient smoking habits in non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC). This work suggested that infiltrating CD8 T cells may not be activated sufficiently in the immunosuppressive microenvironment in non-smokers with adenocarcinoma. To understand the immunogenic microenvironment in NSCLC, we characterised  cells comprehensively by performing an immunohistochemical evaluation using an alternative counting method and multicolour staining method (n = 234), and assessed -related gene expression by using genetic analytical approaches (n = 58). We found that high infiltration of activated CD8 T cells expressing interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and granzyme was correlated with postoperative survival in patients with non-adenocarcinoma. On the contrary, CD8 T- accumulation was identified as a worse prognostic factor in patients with adenocarcinoma, particularly in non-smokers. Infiltrating CD8 T cells were significantly less activated in this microenvironment with high expression of various immunoregulation genes. Potentially immunoregulatory CD8 FOXP3 T cells and immunodysfunctional CD8 GATA3 T cells were increased in adenocarcinoma of non-smokers. CD4 FOXP3 regulatory T cells expressing chemokine receptor-4 (CCR4)- and chemokine ligand (CCL17)-expressing CD163 -like macrophages also accumulated correlatively and significantly in adenocarcinoma of non-smokers. These characteristic  cells may promote tumour progression possibly by creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment in non-smoking patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Our findings may be helpful for refining the current strategy of personalised immunotherapy including - blockade therapy for NSCLC.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This resistance is caused by any of the four  "defects" that occur in pancreatic cancer, including lack of "high quality" T cells, stromal barriers to T cells getting access to tumor cells, immunosuppressive cells such as  macrophages, myeloid derivative suppressor cells, and T regulatory cells, in the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer.

However, for the majority of metastatic colorectal carcinomas the potential and limitations of   inhibition is not fully understood. In this study, the effects of sole and dual CTLA-4 and PD-L1 blockade were investigated in a microsatellite stable highly aggressive orthotopic mouse model of colon cancer. Dual CTLA-4 and PD-L1 inhibition resulted in tumor growth stagnation and completely blocked liver metastasis. Sole CTLA-4 and PD-L1 inhibition only moderately reduced metastatic spread of the colon cancer cells, though CTLA-4 blockade being superior to PD-L1 inhibition. Dual   blockade and sole CTLA-4 inhibition significantly increased intratumoral CD8+ and CD4+ T cells and reduced FOXP3+/CD4+ Treg cells. This was associated with increased expression levels of the pro-inflammatory Th1/M1-related cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-2, and IL-12. Moreover, tumors treated with combined   blockade showed the strongest increase in intratumoral iNOS+ macrophages, reduction of PD-L1+ and Tie2+ macrophages and the lowest expression of /Th2-related IL-4, TARC and COX-2. The assessment of further microenvironmental changes by DCE-MRI and immunohistology revealed no alterations in functional tumor vascularization upon combined   blockade, but a significant increase in intratumoral fibroblasts and collagen I deposition. Thus, the synergistic inhibitory effects of dual   inhibition can be explained by anti-tumorigenic T  responses mediated by CTLA-4 inhibition and M1 macrophage polarization predominantly induced by PD-L1 blockade. This was accompanied by pronounced fibroblast activation highlighting the interconnection between immunogenicity and desmoplasia.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Immunotherapy has demonstrated synergistic survival effects with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in murine GBM. GITR is a co-stimulatory molecule expressed constitutively on regulatory T-cells and by effector T-cells upon activation. We tested the hypothesis that anti-GITR monoclonal antibody (mAb) and SRS together would confer an -mediated survival benefit in glioma using the orthotopic GL261 glioma model.Mice received SRS and anti-GITR 10 days after implantation. The anti-GITR mAbs tested were formatted as mouse IgG1 D265A (anti-GITR (1)) and IgG2a (anti-GITR (2a)) isotypes. Mice were randomized to four treatment groups: (1) control; (2) SRS; (3) anti-GITR; (4) anti-GITR/SRS. SRS was delivered to the tumor in one fraction, and mice were treated with mAb thrice. Mice were euthanized on day 21 to analyze the immunologic profile of tumor, spleen, and tumor draining lymph nodes.Anti-GITR (1)/SRS significantly improved survival over either treatment alone (p < .0001) with a cure rate of 24 % versus 0 % in a T-lymphocyte-dependent manner. There was elevated intratumoral CD4+ effector  infiltration relative to Treg infiltration in mice treated with anti-GITR (1)/SRS, as well as significantly elevated IFNγ and IL-2 production by CD4+ T-cells and elevated IFNγ and TNFα production by CD8+ T-cells. There was increased mRNA expression of M1 markers and decreased expression of  markers in tumor infiltrating mononuclear cells. The anti-GITR (2a)/SRS combination did not improve survival, induce tumor regression, or result in Treg depletion.These findings provide preclinical evidence for the use of anti-GITR (1) non-depleting antibodies in combination with SRS in GBM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467175>ERK1/2 signaling regulates the  microenvironment and macrophage recruitment in glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>The tumor microenvironment is an important determinant of glioblastoma (GBM) progression and response to treatment. How oncogenic signaling in GBM cells modulates the composition of the tumor microenvironment and its activation is unclear. We aimed to explore the potential local immunoregulatory function of ERK1/2 signaling in GBM. Using proteomic and transcriptomic data (RNA seq) available for GBM tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we show that GBM with high levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 have increased infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) with a non-inflammatory  polarization. Using three human GBM  lines in culture, we confirmed the existence of ERK1/2-dependent regulation of the production of the macrophage chemoattractant CCL2/MCP1. In contrast with this positive regulation of TAM recruitment, we found no evidence of a direct effect of ERK1/2 signaling on two other important aspects of TAM regulation by GBM cells: (1) the expression of the   ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, expressed at high mRNA levels in GBM compared with other solid tumors; (2) the production of the tumor metabolite lactate recently reported to dampen tumor immunity by interacting with the receptor GPR65 present on the surface of TAM. Taken together, our observations suggest that ERK1/2 signaling regulates the recruitment of TAM in the GBM microenvironment. These findings highlight some potentially important particularities of the  microenvironment in GBM and could provide an explanation for the recent observation that GBM with activated ERK1/2 signaling may respond better to anti-PD1 therapeutics.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25537422>Novel immunosuppressive agent caerulomycin A exerts its effect by depleting cellular iron content.</a></h2><p>Recently, we have described the use of caerulomycin A (CaeA) as a potent novel immunosuppressive agent. Immunosuppressive drugs are crucial for long-term graft survival following organ transplantation and treatment of autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders, hypersensitivity to allergens, etc. The objective of this study was to identify cellular targets of CaeA and decipher its mechanism of action.Jurkat cells were treated with CaeA and cellular iron content, iron uptake/release, DNA content and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pool determined. Activation of MAPKs; expression level of transferrin receptor 1, ferritin and   control molecules; reactive oxygen species (ROS) and  viability were measured using Western blotting, qRT-PCR or flow cytometry.CaeA caused intracellular iron depletion by reducing its uptake and increasing its release by cells. CaeA caused   arrest by (i) inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) enzyme, which catalyses the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of DNA; (ii) stimulating MAPKs signalling transduction pathways that play an important role in  growth, proliferation and differentiation; and (iii) by targeting   control molecules such as cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and p21(CIP1/WAF1) . The effect of CaeA on  proliferation was reversible.CaeA exerts its immunosuppressive effect by targeting iron. The effect is reversible, which makes CaeA an attractive candidate for development as a potent immunosuppressive drug, but also indicates that iron chelation can be used as a rationale approach to selectively suppress the  system, because compared with normal cells, rapidly proliferating cells require a higher utilization of iron.© 2014 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29137299>Tumor-expressed   B7x promotes cancer progression and antigen-specific CD8 T  exhaustion and suppressive innate  cells.</a></h2><p>B7x (B7-H4 or B7S1) is a coinhibitory member of the B7   ligand family that regulates  function following ligation with its unknown cognate receptors. B7x has limited expression on normal tissues, but is up-regulated on solid human tumors to inhibit anti-tumor immunity and associates with poor clinical prognosis. We assessed the contribution of cytokine stimuli to induce surface B7x expression on cancer cells and the role of tumor-expressed B7x in a murine pulmonary metastasis model, and finally evaluated the potential interaction between B7x and Neuropilin-1, a suggested potential cognate receptor. We showed that pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-10 did not induce expression of B7x on human or murine cancer cells. Following i.v. injection of CT26, a murine colon cancer  line in the BALB/c background, we observed a significant increase in tumor burden in the lung of B7x-expressing CT26 mice compared to B7x-negative parental CT26 control mice. This was marked by a significant increase in  tumor associated macrophages and antigen-specific CD8 T  exhaustion. Finally, we found through multiple systems that there was no evidence for B7x and Neuropilin-1 direct interaction. Thus, the B7x pathway has an essential role in modulating the innate and adaptive   infiltrate in the tumor microenvironment with its currently unknown cognate receptor(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30962963>Phase I clinical trial of decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) administered by hepatic arterial infusion in patients with unresectable liver-predominant metastases.</a></h2><p>DNA demethylating agents may increase the immunogenicity of malignant tumours and increase the efficacy of subsequent treatment with  check point inhibitors. We investigated the safety of administrating the demethylating agent decitabine by hepatic arterial infusionin patients with unresectable liver meta stases from solid tumours in a dose escalation phase I clinical trial. A total of nine eligible patients were enrolled and initiated study treatment at three different dose levels (two patients at 10, four at 15 and six at a dose level of 20mg decitabine//day) (per protocol there was no intent to escalate the dose above the median tolerated intravenous dose level). Decitabine was administered as a 1-hour hepatic arterial infusion on five consecutive days every 4 weeks. Intrapatient dose escalation was applied in five patients. Grades 1 and 2 haematological toxicity was the most frequent treatment-related adverse event. None of the patients experienced treatment-limiting adverse events. Expression analysis of 30 cancer test is antigens (CTA) in pretreatment and post-treatment biopsies from patients indicated an increased expression of 21 CTAs after treatment. There were no objective tumour responses on study treatment or during post study exposure to   therapy in four patients with uveal melanoma liver metastases. We conclude that the investigate d hepatic arterial administration regimen for decitabine can be safely applied, and a dose level of 20 mg//day on five consecutive days every 4 weeks can be considered for further investigation in combinatorial immunotherapy regimens..</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27471622>CTLA4 blockade reduces immature myeloid cells in head and neck squamous  carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Immature myeloid cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and  macrophages play a vital role in the tumor  escape and tumor progression. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), as a negative  , is highly expressed in numerous solid tumors. However, precise functions of CTLA4 in head and neck squamous  carcinoma (HNSCC) have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that the ratio of CD8(+)/CTLA4 can be used as a potential index with a clinical prognostic value for HNSCC. Using immunocompetent transgenic mouse model with spontaneous HNSCC, we directly observed that targeting CTLA4 decreases MDSCs and  macrophages and promotes T  activation in both tumor microenvironment and macro-environment.

We investigated the feasibility of targeting these pathways as a therapeutic option in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse models.We analysed the number of tumour-infiltrating  cells and the inflammatory  profiles in chemically induced liver tumour isolated from wild-type and knockout (KO) mice. In vitro  cocultures were further conducted to investigate the crosstalk between TAMs and HCC cells mediated by OPN, colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) and CSF1 receptor (CSF1R). The in vivo efficacy of anti-PD-L1 and CSF1/CSF1R inhibition was evaluated in OPN overexpressing subcutaneous or orthotopic mouse model of HCC.The numbers of TAMs, as well as the expression levels of  macrophage markers and PD-L1 were significantly decreased, but the levels of cytokines produced by T-helper 1 (Th1) cells were upregulated in tumour tissues from OPN KO mice compared with that from the controls. In addition, we observed a positive association between the OPN and PD-L1 expression, and OPN expression and TAM infiltration in tumour tissues from patients with HCC. We further demonstrated that OPN facilitates chemotactic migration, and alternative activation of macrophages, and promotes the PD-L1 expression in HCC via activation of the CSF1-CSF1R pathway in macrophages. Combining anti-PD-L1 and CSF1R inhibition elicited potent antitumour activity and prolonged survival of OPN tumour-bearing mice. Histological, flow cytometric and ELISA revealed increased CD8 T  infiltration, reduced TAMs and enhanced Th1/Th2 cytokine balance in multiple mouse models of HCC.OPN/CSF1/CSF1R axis plays a critical role in the immunosuppressive nature of the HCC microenvironment. Blocking CSF1/CSF1R prevents TAM trafficking and thereby enhances the efficacy of   inhibitors for the treatment of HCC.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

Poly(l-glutamic acid)-combretastatin A4 conjugate (PLG-CA4) is a novel class of VDAs. Though it has notable antitumor activity, it can induce host  responses that promote tumor growth. Here, PLG-CA4 induces the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward the -like phenotype in 4T1 metastatic breast cancer (Control 30% vs PLG-CA4 53%;  < 0.05). Compared to the monotherapy of PLG-CA4, inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ) attenuates the immunosuppressive effect of PLG-CA4 treatment by decreasing the number of -like TAMs (2.0 × 10 to 1.5 × 10 per tumor) and potential enhancement of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (3.0 × 10 to 5.7 × 10 per tumor). Importantly, PI3Kγ inhibitor synergizing with PLG-CA4 significantly extends the mean survival time from 52 days in monotherapy-treated mice to 61.8 days. Additionally, the combination of PLG-CA4 and PI3Kγ inhibitor improves the tumor therapeutic effect of NLG919, an inhibitor of   indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). As far as it is known, this is the first demonstrated study that VDAs induce the reshaping of macrophages to the -like phenotype.

Adaptive and innate  cells are present in the tumor microenvironment, indicating GIST as inflamed tumors. In addition, murine models suggested a potential interaction between  components and imatinib. In this retrospective study, the GIST immunological profile was investigated through  analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC), exploring the basis for immunotherapy approaches. Gene expression profiles (GEP) from 31 KIT/PDGFRA-mutant GIST were analyzed to evaluate the tumor microenvironment and immunotherapy predictive signatures such as the expanded IFN-γ-induced  signature (EIIS) and the T--inflamed signature (TIS). GEP and IHC supported the presence of  infiltrate in GIST, with dominance of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and  macrophages showing a remarkable similarity with melanoma microenvironment. The EIIS genes were expressed in most of GIST samples and positively correlated with PD-L1 abundance ( < .0001). Co-expression was also found between PD-L1 and CD8A ( < .0001) or CD8B ( = .0003). Moreover, the median TIS score for GIST was between the 65th and 70th percentile of the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset, in the same range of tumors responding to anti-PD-1/PD-L1. Analysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus database GIST samples pre- and post-treatment confirmed that imatinib downregulates PD-L1 and IRF1 expression through the inhibition of KIT and PDGFRA, thus contributing to counteract the suppressed adaptive  response against GIST. The presence of a rich  infiltrate in GIST along with the presence of TIS and EIIS suggests that GIST may benefit from immunotherapy along with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27757304>Tim-3 promotes tumor-promoting  macrophage polarization by binding to STAT1 and suppressing the STAT1-miR-155 signaling axis.</a></h2><p>T  Ig mucin-3 (Tim-3), an   inhibitor, shows therapeutic potential.

Blood microbiome was analyzed at month (M) M0 and . Citrulline rates were evaluated at M0, , M4 and M6.Seventy-two patients were included (EUA in 42%). Overall survival (OS) was longer without EUA (median 13.4 months) than with EUA (5.1 months, p = 0.03). Thirty-five patients (49%) had plasma samples available. High citrulline rate (≥20 μM) at M0 was associated with tumor response (p = 0.084) and clinical benefit (nivolumab > 6 months) (p = 0.002). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.9 months (high citrulline) vs 1.6 months (low citrulline) (p < 0.0001), and median OS were respectively non reached vs 2.2 months (p < 0.0001).

Several publications have demonstrated that selective HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) can influence tumor immunogenicity and the functional activity of specific  cells. In particular, the selective inhibition of HDAC6 has been reported to decrease tumor growth in several malignancies. However, there is still no clarity about the cellular components mediating this effect. In this study, we evaluated the HDAC6i Nexturastat A as a priming agent to facilitate the transition of the tumor microenvironment from "cold" to "hot", and potentially augment  check-point blockade therapies. This combination modality demonstrated to significantly reduce tumor growth in syngeneic melanoma tumor models. Additionally, we observed a complete neutralization of the up-regulation of PD-L1 and other immunosuppressive pathways induced by the treatment with anti-PD-1 blockade. This combination also showed profound changes in the tumor microenvironment such as enhanced infiltration of  cells, increased central and effector T  memory, and a significant reduction of pro-tumorigenic  macrophages. The evaluation of individual components of the tumor microenvironment suggested that the in vivo anti-tumor activity of HDAC6i is mediated by its effect on tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages, and not directly over T cells. Overall, our results indicate that selective HDAC6i could be used as immunological priming agents to sensitize immunologically "cold" tumors and subsequently improve ongoing  check-point blockade therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29112015>PD-L1 and PD-L2 Are Differentially Expressed by Macrophages or Tumor Cells in Primary Cutaneous Diffuse Large B- Lymphoma, Leg Type.</a></h2><p>As  molecules' inhibition may represent a therapeutic option in relapsing cases, we assessed programmed death ligands' (PD-L1/PD-L2) expression in a series of 29 primary cutaneous diffuse large B- lymphoma, leg-type (PCDLBCL-LT) cases. Double immunostaining for either PD-L1 or PD-L2 was associated either with PAX5 staining to evaluate tumor cells or with CD68 or CD163 staining for macrophages. The microenvironment of PCDLBCL-LT was characterized by immunostainings for CD3 (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes), FOXP3 (regulatory T cells), programmed  death-1, and CD33 (myeloid-derived suppressor cells). The 9p24.1 locus encoding for PD-L1/PD-L2 was evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization. A PD-L1 expression was observed in all cases. However, double staining with PD-L1/PAX5 identified only 1 case harboring PD-L1 expression by tumor cells. All cases displayed PD-L1 expression by numerous  cells, characterized as CD68 CD163  macrophages. A normal fluorescence in situ hybridization pattern was observed in 21 of 26 cases. Three cases (11.5%) harbored a low polysomy status including the case with PD-L1 expression by tumor cells. Interestingly, 2 cases (7.7%) exhibited a PD-L1/PD-L2 locus break-apart pattern, and PD-L2 expression by tumor cells was observed. PD-L2 expression by tumor cells was not observed in the 24 cases without 9p24.1 rearrangement. Treating patients with relapsing PCDLBCL-LT by using   inhibitors may have an indirect effect through  cells, except in rare cases with 9p24.1 rearrangement leading to PD-L2 expression by tumor cells.

A higher proportion of regulatory T cells was associated with a worse outcome (HR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.23-.06; P < 0.01) in renal clear  carcinoma (KIRC). In renal papillary  carcinoma (KIRP), M1 macrophages were associated with a favorable outcome (HR = .43, 95% CI .25-.72; P < 0.01), while  macrophages indicated a worse outcome (HR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.45-4.47; P < 0.01). Moreover, the immunomodulator molecules CTLA4 and LAG3 were associated with a poor prognosis in KIRC, and IDO1 and PD-L2 were associated with a poor prognosis in KIRP. This study indicates TIICs are important determinants of prognosis in RCC meanwhile reveals potential targets and biomarkers for immunotherapy development.© 2019 The Authors.

Mice with Treg -restricted Neuropilin-1 deficiency show tumor resistance while maintaining peripheral  homeostasis, thereby providing a controlled system to interrogate the impact of intratumoral Treg cells on the TME. Using this and other genetic models, we showed that Treg cells shaped the transcriptional landscape across multiple tumor-infiltrating   types. Treg cells suppressed CD8 T  secretion of interferon-γ (IFNγ), which would otherwise block the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-mediated fatty acid synthesis in immunosuppressive (-like) tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Thus, Treg cells indirectly but selectively sustained -like TAM metabolic fitness, mitochondrial integrity, and survival. SREBP1 inhibition augmented the efficacy of   blockade, suggesting that targeting Treg cells or their modulation of lipid metabolism in -like TAMs could improve cancer immunotherapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the immunologic link between primary tumor and lymph nodes is insufficiently understood. Galectin 3 (Gal3) promotes  polarization of macrophages and contributes to immunosuppression. The current study analyzes the association between Gal3 expression in regional lymph nodes of oscc with histomorphologic parameters (T-, N-, L- Pn-stage, grading) of the primary tumor. Additionally, Gal3 expression is correlated with markers of macrophage polarization (M1 vs. ).Preoperative diagnostic biopsies (n = 26), tumor resection specimens (n = 34), tumor-free lymph nodes (n = 28) and lymph node metastases (n = 10) of T1/T2 oscc patients were immunohistochemically analyzed for Gal3 and macrophage marker (CD68, CD11c, CD163 and MRC1) expression. The number of positive cells and the expression ratios were quantitatively assessed.High Gal3 expression in tumor-free regional lymph nodes was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with increased tumor size. The epithelial compartment of lymph node metastases showed a significantly (p < 0.05) increased Gal3 expression compared to biopsies and tumor resection specimens.  density of  macrophages was significantly (p < 0.05) and positively correlated with the number of Gal3 expressing cells in lymph nodes and tumor specimens.Gal3 expression in regional lymph nodes might be associated with oscc progression. The increased Gal3 expression in regional lymph nodes of larger tumors underlines the need of immunomodulatory treatment concepts in early-stage oscc. Blocking of Gal3 might be a therapeutic option in oral cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31038851> microenvironments differ in  characteristics and outcome of glioblastoma multiforme.</a></h2><p>Understanding the interactions between tumors and the host  system holds great promise to uncover biomarkers for targeted therapies, predict the prognosis of patients and guide clinical treatment. However, the  signatures of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remain largely unstudied in terms of systematic analyses. We aimed to classify GBM samples according to -related genes and complement the existing immunotherapy system knowledge. In this study, we designed a strategy to identify 3  subtypes representing 3 different  microenvironments (M1-M3) and associated with prognosis. The 3 subtypes were significantly different in terms of specific  characteristics (  subpopulations,  responses,  cells, and  gene interactions). In additional, copy number variations and methylation changes were identified that correlated with genes related to a worse prognosis subtype in the microenvironment. More importantly, in M3 (worst prognosis subtype) and  (best prognosis subtype), the interaction between  cells and  genes was different, which had an important effect on the prognosis. Finally, we used risk scores of  cells and  genes to evaluate the prognosis of GBM patients and validated the results with 3 independent datasets. Disordered interactions between  cells and  genes result in a change in the  microenvironment and affects the prognosis of patients. We propose that a better understanding of the  microenvironment of advanced cancers may provide new insights into immunotherapy.© 2019 The Authors.

We are evaluating live-attenuated, double-deleted  expressing tumor antigens (LADD-Ag) in the clinic. Here we show in numerous mouse models that while treatment with nonrecombinant LADD induced some changes in the TME, no antitumor efficacy was observed, even when combined with   blockade. In contrast, LADD-Ag promoted tumor rejection by priming tumor-specific KLRG1PD1CD62L CD8 T cells. These IFNγ-producing effector CD8 T cells infiltrated the tumor and converted the tumor from an immunosuppressive to an inflamed microenvironment that was characterized by a decrease in regulatory T cells (Treg) levels, a proinflammatory cytokine milieu, and the shift of  macrophages to an inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)CD206 M1 phenotype. Remarkably, these LADD-Ag-induced tumor-specific T cells persisted for more than 2 months after primary tumor challenge and rapidly controlled secondary tumor challenge. Our results indicate that the striking antitumor efficacy observed in mice with LADD-based immunotherapy stems from TME remodeling which is a direct consequence of eliciting potent, systemic tumor-specific CD8 T cells.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

Evaluating the effect of standard chemotherapy on the  microenvironment may suggest new opportunities for immunotherapy-based approaches to treating HR/HER2 breast tumors.HR/HER2 breast tumors were analyzed before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. sTIL were assessed histologically; CD8 cells, CD68 cells, and PD-L1 staining were assessed immunohistochemically; whole transcriptome sequencing and panel RNA expression analysis (NanoString) were performed.Ninety-six patients were analyzed from two cohorts ( = 55, Dana-Farber cohort;  = 41, MD Anderson cohort). sTIL, CD8, and PD-L1 on tumor cells were higher in tumors with basal PAM50 intrinsic subtype. Higher levels of tissue-based lymphocyte (sTIL, CD8, PD-L1) and macrophage (CD68) markers, as well as gene expression markers of lymphocyte or macrophage phenotypes (NanoString or CIBERSORT), correlated with favorable response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but not with improved distant metastasis-free survival in these cohorts or a large gene expression dataset ( = 302). In paired pre-/postchemotherapy samples, sTIL and CD8 cells were significantly decreased after treatment, whereas expression analyses (NanoString) demonstrated significant increase of multiple myeloid signatures. Single gene expression implicated increased expression of immunosuppressive (-like) macrophage-specific genes after chemotherapy.The  microenvironment of HR/HER2 tumors differs according to tumor biology. This cohort of paired pre-/postchemotherapy samples suggests a critical role for immunosuppressive macrophage expansion in residual disease.

Gal-1 is overexpressed in GBM and drives chemo- and immunotherapy resistance. To promote nose-to-brain transport, we designed siRNA targeting Gal-1 (siGal-1) loaded chitosan nanoparticles that silence Gal-1 in the TME. Intranasal siGal-1 delivery induces a remarkable switch in the TME composition, with reduced myeloid suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, and increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Gal-1 knock-down reduces macrophages' polarization switch from M1 (pro-inflammatory) to  (anti-inflammatory) during GBM progression. These changes are accompanied by normalization of the tumor vasculature and increased survival for tumor bearing mice. The combination of siGal-1 treatment with temozolomide or immunotherapy (dendritic  vaccination and PD-1 blocking) displays synergistic effects, increasing the survival of tumor bearing mice. Moreover, we could confirm the role of Gal-1 on lymphocytes in GBM patients by matching the Gal-1 expression and their T  signatures. These findings indicate that intranasal siGal-1 nanoparticle delivery could be a valuable adjuvant treatment to increase the efficiency of - blockade and chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28003187>Angiopoietin-2 as a Biomarker and Target for   Therapy.</a></h2><p>  therapies targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1 have proven effective in cancer treatment. However, the identification of biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes and mechanisms to overcome resistance remain as critical needs. Angiogenesis is increasingly appreciated as an  modulator with potential for combinatorial use with  blockade. Angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) is an  target in patients and is involved in resistance to anti-VEGF treatment with the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab. We investigated the predictive and prognostic value of circulating ANGPT2 in metastatic melanoma patients receiving   therapy. High pretreatment serum ANGPT2 was associated with reduced overall survival in CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade-treated patients. These treatments also increased serum ANGPT2 in many patients early after treatment initiation, whereas ipilimumab plus bevacizumab treatment decreased serum concentrations. ANGPT2 increases were associated with reduced response and/or overall survival. Ipilimumab increased, and ipilimumab plus bevacizumab decreased, tumor vascular ANGPT2 expression in a subset of patients, which was associated with increased and decreased tumor infiltration by CD68 and CD163 macrophages, respectively. In vitro, bevacizumab blocked VEGF-induced ANGPT2 expression in tumor-associated endothelial cells, whereas ANGPT2 increased PD-L1 expression on -polarized macrophages. Treatments elicited long-lasting and functional antibody responses to ANGPT2 in a subset of patients receiving clinical benefit. Our findings suggest that serum ANGPT2 may be considered as a predictive and prognostic biomarker for   therapy and may contribute to treatment resistance via increasing proangiogenic and immunosuppressive activities in the tumor microenvironment. Targeting ANGPT2 provides a rational combinatorial approach to improve the efficacy of  therapy.

However, in spite of the general association between a high effector T  density and improved outcome, our recent work has revealed a specific lymphocyte-driven cancer -supporting signal. Indeed, lymphocyte-derived CCL5 supports CCR5-positive tumor  proliferation and thereby fosters tumor growth in metastatic liver lesions. Upon systematic analysis of CCR5 expression by tumor cells using immunohistochemistry, we observed that the intensity of CCR5 increases with primary tumor size and peaks in T4 tumors. In liver metastases however, though CCR5 expression intensity is globally heightened compared to primary tumors, alterations in the expression patterns appear, leading to "patchiness" of the stain. CCR5 patchiness is, therefore, a signature of liver metastases in our cohort ( = 97 specimens) and relates to globally decreased expression intensity, but does not influence the extent of the response to CCR5 inhibitor Maraviroc in patients. Moreover, CCR5 patchiness relates to a poor  landscape characterized by a low cytotoxic-to-regulatory T  ratio at the invasive margin and enriched cellular and molecular markers of macrophage  polarization. Finally, because higher numbers of PD-1- and CTLA-4-positive cells surround tumors with patchy CCR5 expression, one can speculate that these tumors potentially respond to   blockade. This hypothesis is corroborated by the prolonged disease-free survival and disease-specific survival observed in patients with low gene expression of CCR5 in metastases from two publically available cohorts. These observations highlight the complex role of the CCL5-CCR5 axis in CRC metastatic progression and warrant further investigations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692665>Macrophages: versatile players in renal inflammation and fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Macrophages have important roles in  surveillance and in the maintenance of kidney homeostasis; their response to renal injury varies enormously depending on the nature and duration of the insult. Macrophages can adopt a variety of phenotypes: at one extreme, M1 pro-inflammatory cells contribute to infection clearance but can also promote renal injury; at the other extreme,  anti-inflammatory cells have a reparative phenotype and can contribute to the resolution phase of the response to injury. In addition, bone marrow monocytes can differentiate into myeloid-derived suppressor cells that can regulate T  immunity in the kidney. However, macrophages can also promote renal fibrosis, a major driver of progression to end-stage renal disease, and the CD206 subset of  macrophages is strongly associated with renal fibrosis in both human and experimental diseases. Myofibroblasts are important contributors to renal fibrosis and recent studies provide evidence that macrophages recruited from the bone marrow can transition directly into myofibroblasts within the injured kidney. This process is termed macrophage-to-myofibroblast transition (MMT) and is driven by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1)-Smad3 signalling via a Src-centric regulatory network. MMT may serve as a key  for the progression of chronic inflammation into pathogenic fibrosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28515301>Influenza A Virus NS1 Protein Promotes Efficient Nuclear Export of Unspliced Viral M1 mRNA.</a></h2><p>Influenza A virus mRNAs are transcribed by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in the  nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm for translation. Segment 7 produces two major transcripts: an unspliced mRNA that encodes the M1 matrix protein and a spliced transcript that encodes the  ion channel. Export of both mRNAs is dependent on the cellular NXF1/TAP pathway, but it is unclear how they are recruited to the export machinery or how the intron-containing but unspliced M1 mRNA bypasses the normal quality-control . Using fluorescent  hybridization to monitor segment 7 mRNA localization, we found that cytoplasmic accumulation of unspliced M1 mRNA was inefficient in the absence of NS1, both in the context of segment 7 RNPs reconstituted by plasmid transfection and in mutant virus-infected cells. This effect was independent of any major effect on steady-state levels of segment 7 mRNA or splicing but corresponded to a ∼5-fold reduction in the accumulation of M1. A similar defect in intronless hemagglutinin (HA) mRNA nuclear export was seen with an NS1 mutant virus. Efficient export of M1 mRNA required both an intact NS1 RNA-binding domain and effector domain. Furthermore, while wild-type NS1 interacted with cellular NXF1 and also increased the interaction of segment 7 mRNA with NXF1, mutant NS1 polypeptides unable to promote mRNA export did neither. Thus, we propose that NS1 facilitates late viral gene expression by acting as an adaptor between viral mRNAs and the cellular nuclear export machinery to promote their nuclear export. Influenza A virus is a major pathogen of a wide variety of mammalian and avian species that threatens public health and food security. A fuller understanding of the virus life  is important to aid control strategies. The virus has a small genome that encodes relatively few proteins that are often multifunctional. Here, we characterize a new function for the NS1 protein, showing that, as well as previously identified roles in antagonizing the innate  defenses of the  and directly upregulating translation of viral mRNAs, it also promotes the nuclear export of the viral late gene mRNAs by acting as an adaptor between the viral mRNAs and the cellular mRNA nuclear export machinery.Copyright © 2017 Pereira et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29436395>Myeloid-targeted immunotherapies act in synergy to induce inflammation and antitumor immunity.</a></h2><p>Eliciting effective antitumor  responses in patients who fail  inhibitor therapy is a critical challenge in cancer immunotherapy, and in such patients, tumor-associated myeloid cells and macrophages (TAMs) are promising therapeutic targets. We demonstrate in an autochthonous, poorly immunogenic mouse model of melanoma that combination therapy with an agonistic anti-CD40 mAb and CSF-1R inhibitor potently suppressed tumor growth. Microwell assays to measure multiplex protein secretion by single cells identified that untreated tumors have distinct TAM subpopulations secreting MMP9 or cosecreting CCL17/22, characteristic of an -like state. Combination therapy reduced the frequency of these subsets, while simultaneously inducing a separate polyfunctional inflammatory TAM subset cosecreting TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12. Tumor suppression by this combined therapy was partially dependent on T cells, and on TNF-α and IFN-γ. Together, this study demonstrates the potential for targeting TAMs to convert a "cold" into an "inflamed" tumor microenvironment capable of eliciting protective T  responses.© 2018 Perry et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31217164>Intrinsic Resistance to   Blockade in a Mismatch Repair-Deficient Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy with  inhibitors, such as the programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab, are effective in a variety of tumors, yet not all patients respond. Tumor microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) has emerged as a biomarker of response to  blockade, leading to the tissue agnostic approval of pembrolizumab in MSI-H cancers. Here we describe a patient with MSI-H colorectal cancer that was treated with this   inhibitor and exhibited progression of disease. We examined this intrinsic resistance through genomic, transcriptional, and pathologic characterization of the patient's tumor and the associated  microenvironment. The tumor had typical MSI-H molecular features, including a high neoantigen load. We also identified biallelic loss of the gene for β-microglobulin (), whose product is critical for antigen presentation.  infiltration deconvolution analysis of bulk transcriptome data from this anti-PD-1-resistant tumor and hundreds of other colorectal cancer specimens revealed a high natural killer  and  macrophage infiltration in the patient's cancer.

The functions of TGIF1 in in vivo PDAC growth, dissemination, and metastasis were assessed using conditional inactivation of TGIF1 in well-established autochthonous mouse models of PDAC. Primary cells from TGIF1 null or wild type PDAC mice were examined by assays for  proliferation, migration, invasion, soft agar and xenograft tumorigenesis. Gene expression profiling, pathway analyses, epigenetic changes associated with TGIF1 loss, and in vitro and in vivo effects of 4-MU were assessed.Conditional deletion of TGIF1 in the mouse pancreas had no discernible effect on pancreatic development or physiology. Notably, TGIF1 loss induced KrasG12D-driven PDAC models exhibited shorter latency and greater propensity for distant metastases. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms highlighted the TGIF1 loss-induced activation of the hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2)-CD44 signaling pathway and upregulation of the   regulator PD-L1 to facilitate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor  suppression.

At present, the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is a major immunotherapeutic target for  inhibition in various cancer types, but information on the clinical significance of PD-L1 expression in cervical cancer is largely lacking. Here, we studied PD-L1 expression in paraffin-embedded samples from two cohorts of patients with cervical cancer: primary tumor samples from cohort I (squamous  carcinoma, n=156 and adenocarcinoma, n=49) and primary and paired metastatic tumor samples from cohort II (squamous  carcinoma, n=96 and adenocarcinoma, n=31). Squamous  carcinomas were more frequently positive for PD-L1 and also contained more PD-L1-positive tumor-associated macrophages as compared with adenocarcinomas (both P<0.001). PD-L1-positive tumor-associated macrophages were found to express CD163 and/or CD14 by triple fluorescent immunohistochemistry, demonstrating an -like phenotype. Interestingly, disease-free survival (P=0.022) and disease-specific survival (P=0.046) were significantly poorer in squamous  carcinoma patients with diffuse PD-L1 expression as compared with patients with marginal PD-L1 expression (i.e., on the interface between tumor and stroma) in primary tumors. Disease-specific survival was significantly worse in adenocarcinoma patients with PD-L1-positive tumor-associated macrophages compared with adenocarcinoma patients without PD-L1-positive tumor-associated macrophages (P=0.014). No differences in PD-L1 expression between primary tumors and paired metastatic lymph nodes were detected. However, PD-L1-positive  cells were found in greater abundance around the metastatic tumors as compared with the paired primary tumors (P=0.001 for squamous  carcinoma and P=0.041 for adenocarcinoma).

ATC has a high prevalence of BRAF mutations and is associated with an immunosuppressive microenvironment; we previously demonstrated that the combination of BRAF inhibitor and  inhibitor immunotherapy synergistically reduce tumour volume in an immunocompetent mouse model of orthotopic ATC.We again utilised our mouse model of ATC to assess the combination of BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 and anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 antibody on survival, and performed   profiling of lymphoid and myeloid-lineage cells during maximal treatment response and tumour regrowth.Combination therapy dramatically improved mouse survival. Maximal tumour reduction was associated with increases in the number and cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells and NK cells, as well as increases in mostly M1-polarised tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) and decreases in myeloid-derived suppressor-like cells. Regrowth of tumour occurred after 2-3 weeks of ongoing combination therapy, and was most significantly associated with decreased TAMs and a dramatic increase in -polarisation.Combination of PLX4720 and anti-PD-L1/PD-1 antibody dramatically reduced tumour volume, prolonged survival and improved the anti-tumour  profile in murine ATC.

In addition, we developed a multivariate risk prediction model that stratified a poor survival group based on clinical parameters and mIHC data. We analyzed BM biopsy samples of ALL patients (n = 52) and healthy controls (n = 14) using mIHC with 30 different immunophenotype markers and computerized image analysis. In ALL BM, the proportions of M1-like macrophages, granzyme B+CD57+CD8+ T cells, and CD27+ T cells were decreased, whereas the proportions of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and -like macrophages were increased. Also, the expression of  molecules PD1 and CTLA4 was elevated. In the multivariate model, age, platelet count, and the proportion of PD1+TIM3+ double-positive CD4+ T cells differentiated a poor survival group.

Pro-inflammatory cytokine, interferon (IFN)-γ, confers anti-tumor activity using several different mechanisms. Conversely, higher expression of interleukin (IL)-17 is associated with worse prognosis. Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 correlates positively with poor long-term survival of head and neck squamous  carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. IL-1α affects cancer associated fibroblasts and macrophages, and promote several malignant phenotypes including  suppression. Some anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, relate to pro-tumoral activities. Among   modulators, programmed death (PD-)1 and PD-ligand (L)1 facilitate oral squamous  carcinoma (OSCC)  evasion from  surveillance, and the expression status of these has a prognostic value. OSCCs contain tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) as major stromal cells of their tumor microenvironment. Among the two distinctive states,  macrophages support tumor invasion, metastasis and  suppression. Crosstalk between TAMs and OSCC or cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) plays an important role in the progression of OSCC. Clinical trials with blocking antibodies against IL-1α or melanoma-associated antigens have been reported as therapeutic approaches against OSCCs. The most promising approach activating antitumor immunity is the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 axis.

We show that targeting GRP78, IRE1, and PERK differentially regulates macrophage polarization. Specifically, PERK targeting enhanced macrophage proliferation and macrophage-mediated killing but not GRP78 or IRE1. Targeting UPR in cancer cells also differentially affected macrophage cytolytic capacity. Tumoral IRE1 or GRP78 inhibition enhanced macrophage-mediated cancer  clearance. Conditioned media from GRP78-silenced cancer cells caused reciprocal regulation of CD80 and CD206, suggesting control of plasticity by secreted factors. GRP78 targeting in mice resulted in a cytokine shift and increased tumoral CD80+/CD68+ cells, suggesting an M1-like profile. Targeting UPR in both macrophage and cancer cells indicates that PERK or GRP78 reduction enhances macrophage clearance of cancer cells. Recent evidence suggests that macrophage polarization influences   therapy resistance. To determine whether UPR effects immunotherapy resistance, analysis of matched melanoma patient PBMC before/after developing ipilimumab resistance demonstrated increased UPR signaling and an -like macrophage population, supporting a novel role of UPR signaling and innate  regulation in anti-CTLA-4 therapy resistance. These data suggest that targeting GRP78 or PERK promotes an anti-tumor  response by either directly promoting macrophage cytolytic activity or indirectly by shifting tumoral cytokine secretion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29868471>The Role of Macrophage/B- Interactions in the Pathophysiology of B- Lymphomas.</a></h2><p>Macrophages (MPs) are heterogeneous, multifunctional, myeloid-derived leukocytes that are part of the innate  system, playing wide-ranging critical roles in basic biological activities, including maintenance of tissue homeostasis involving clearance of microbial pathogens. Tumor-associated MPs (TAMs) are MPs with defined specific  phenotypes now known to play central roles in the pathophysiology of a wide spectrum of malignant neoplasms. Also, TAMs are often intrinsic cellular components of the essential tumor microenvironment (TME). In concert with lymphoid-lineage B and T cells at various developmental stages, TAMs can mediate enhanced tumor progression, often leading to poor clinical prognosis, at least partly through secretion of chemokines, cytokines, and various active proteases shown to stimulate tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and immunosuppression. Researchers recently showed that TAMs express certain key -associated proteins [e.g., programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1), programmed  death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)] that appear to be involved in T- activation and that these proteins are targets of other specific -blocking immunotherapies (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) currently part of new therapeutic paradigms for chemotherapy-resistant neoplasms. Although much is known about the wide spectrum and flexibility of MPs under many normal and neoplastic conditions, relatively little is known about the increasingly important interactions between MPs and B-lymphoid cells, particularly in the TME in patients with aggressive B- non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL-B). Normal and neoplastic lymphoid and myeloid /MP lineages appear to share many primitive cellular characteristics as well as transcriptional factor interactions in human and animal ontogenic studies. Such cells are capable of ectopic transcription factor-induced lineage reprogramming or transdifferentiation from early myeloid/monocytic lineages to later induce B- lymphomagenesis in experimental  murine systems. Close cellular interactions between endogenous clonal neoplastic B cells and related aberrant myeloid precursor cells/MPs appear to be important interactive components of aggressive NHL-B that we discuss herein in the larger context of the putative role of B-/MP cellular lineage interactions involved in NHL-B pathophysiology during ensuing lymphoma development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26686046>Ratios of T-  effectors and  molecules as prognostic biomarkers in diffuse large B- lymphoma: a population-based study.</a></h2><p>Risk-stratification of diffuse large B- lymphoma (DLBCL) requires identification of patients with disease that is not cured, despite initial treatment with R-CHOP.

We aimed to develop a novel, easily applicable, tissue-based prognostic biomarker based on quantification of the tumour microenvironment that is independent of and additive to the R-IPI and  of origin.We performed digital hybridisation on the NanoString platform to assess the relation between  effector and inhibitory () genes in 252 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded DLBCL tissue specimens obtained from patients treated with R-CHOP. We used a tree-based survival model to quantify net antitumoral immunity (using ratios of  effector to  genes) and to generate a cutoff as an outcome predictor in 158 of the 252 patients. We validated this model in tissue (n=233) and blood (n=140) samples from two independent cohorts treated with R-CHOP.T- and NK-  effector molecule expression correlated with tumour-associated macrophage and PD-1/PD-L1 axis markers, consistent with malignant B cells triggering a dynamic  response to adapt to and evade  surveillance. The ratio of CD4*CD8 to (CD163:CD68[])*PD-L1 was better able to stratify overall survival than was any one  marker or combination, distinguishing groups with disparate 4-year overall survival. 94 (59%) of 158 patients had a score above the cutoff and 4-year overall survival of 92·1% (95% CI 82·9-96·7), and the remaining 64 (41%) patients had a score below the cutoff and 4-year overall survival of 47·0% (32·8-60·5; hazard ratio [HR] 8·3, 95% CI 4·3-17·3; p<0·0001). The CD4*CD8:*PD-L1  ratio was independent of and added to the R-IPI and  of origin. Tissue findings in the independent tissue cohort accorded with those in our initial tissue cohort. 139 (60%) of 233 patients had a score above the cutoff and 4-year overall survival of 75·6% (95% CI 64·6-83·6), with the remaining 94 (40%) patients having a score below the cutoff (63·5% [52·5-72·7]; HR 1·9, 95% CI 1·1-3·3; p=0·0067).Ratios of  effectors to  augment the  of origin and R-IPI in DLBCL and are applicable to paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens.

However, the majority of patients do not benefit from these agents. To improve the efficacy of  inhibitors, intratumoral (i.t.) injection with innate  activators, TLR7 and TLR9 agonists, were tested along with programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) blockade. The combination therapy suppressed tumor growth at the primary injected and distant sites in human papillomavirus-negative (HPV-negative) SCC7 and MOC1, and HPV-positive MEER syngeneic mouse models. Abscopal effects and suppression of secondary challenged tumor suggest that local treatment with TLR agonists in combination with anti-PD-1 provided systemic adaptive immunity. I.t. treatment with a TLR7 agonist increased the ratio of M1 to  tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and promoted the infiltration of tumor-specific IFNγ-producing CD8+ T cells. Anti-PD-1 treatment increased T  receptor (TCR) clonality of CD8+ T cells in tumors and spleens of treated mice. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that combination therapy with i.t. delivery of TLR agonists and PD-1 blockade activates TAMs and induces tumor-specific adaptive  responses, leading to suppression of primary tumor growth and prevention of metastasis in HNSCC models.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31422218> profiles in primary squamous  carcinoma of the head and neck.</a></h2><p>In this study we describe the tumor microenvironment, the signaling pathways and genetic alterations associated with the presence or absence of CD8+ T- infiltration in primary squamous  carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) tumors.Two SCCHN multi-analyte cohorts were utilized, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Chicago Head and Neck Genomics (CHGC) cohort. A well-established chemokine signature classified SCCHN tumors into high and low CD8+ T- inflamed phenotypes (TCIP-H, TCIP-L respectively). Gene set enrichment and iPANDA analyses were conducted to dissect differences in signaling pathways, somatic mutations and copy number aberrations for TCIP-H versus TCIP-L tumors, stratified by HPV status.TCIP-H SCCHN tumors were enriched in multiple   irrespective of HPV-status. HPV-positive tumors were enriched in markers of T-regulatory cells (Tregs) and HPV-negative tumors in protumorigenic  macrophages. TCIP-L SCCHN tumors were enriched for the β-catenin/WNT and Hedgehog signaling pathways, had frequent mutations in NSD1, amplifications in EGFR and YAP1, as well as CDKN2A deletions. TCIP-H SCCHN tumors were associated with the MAPK/ERK, JAK/STAT and mTOR/AKT signaling pathways, and were enriched in CASP8, EP300, EPHA2, HRAS mutations, CD274, PDCD1LG2, JAK2 amplifications.Our findings support that combinatorial   blockade and depletion strategies targeting Tregs in HPV-positive and  macrophages in HPV-negative tumors may lead to improved antitumor  responses in patients with TCIP-H SCCHN. We highlight novel pathways and genetic events that may serve as candidate biomarkers and novel targeted therapies to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in SCCHN patients.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Although efficacy of these agents has been linked to a pre-existing level of tumor  infiltrate, it remains unclear why some patients exhibit deep and durable responses to these agents while others do not benefit. To examine the influence of tumor genetics on tumor  state, we interrogated the relationship between somatic mutation and copy number alteration with infiltration levels of 7   types across 40 tumor cohorts in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Levels of cytotoxic T, regulatory T, total T, natural killer, and B cells, as well as monocytes and  macrophages, were estimated using a novel set of transcriptional signatures that were designed to resist interference from the cellular heterogeneity of tumors. Tumor mutational load and estimates of tumor purity were included in our association models to adjust for biases in multi-modal genomic data. Copy number alterations, mutations summarized at the gene level, and position-specific mutations were evaluated for association with tumor  infiltration. We observed a strong relationship between copy number loss of a large region of chromosome 9p and decreased lymphocyte estimates in melanoma, pancreatic, and head/neck cancers. Mutations in the oncogenes PIK3CA, FGFR3, and RAS/RAF family members, as well as the tumor suppressor TP53, were linked to changes in  infiltration, usually in restricted tumor types. Associations of specific WNT/beta-catenin pathway genetic changes with  state were limited, but we noted a link between 9p loss and the expression of the WNT receptor FZD3, suggesting that there are interactions between 9p alteration and WNT pathways. Finally, two different  death regulators, CASP8 and DIDO1, were often mutated in head/neck tumors that had higher lymphocyte infiltrates. In summary, our study supports the relevance of tumor genetics to questions of efficacy and resistance in  blockade therapies. It also highlights the need to assess genome-wide influences during exploration of any specific tumor pathway hypothesized to be relevant to therapeutic response. Some of the observed genetic links to  state, like 9p loss, may influence response to cancer  therapies. Others, like mutations in  death pathways, may help guide combination therapeutic approaches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29540832>miR-21 depletion in macrophages promotes tumoricidal polarization and enhances PD-1 immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is one of the most abundant microRNAs in mammalian cells. It has been intensively studied for its role in regulating apoptosis and oncogenic transformation. However, the impact of miR-21 on host anti-tumor immunity remains unknown. Tumor-associated macrophages are a major leukocyte type that infiltrates tumors and predominantly develops into immunosuppressive, tumor-promoting -like macrophages. In contrast, the pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages have tumoricidal activity. In this study, we show that genetic deficiency of miR-21 promotes the polarization of macrophages toward an M1-like phenotype in vivo and in vitro in the presence of tumor cells; thus it confers host mice with enhanced anti-tumor immunity. By downregulating JAK2 and STAT1, miR-21 inhibits the IFN-γ-induced STAT1 signaling pathway, which is required for macrophage M1 polarization. We also show that the expression of miR-21 in macrophages is regulated upon polarization stimuli as well as upon macrophages co-culturing with tumor cells. Thus, tumor cells may stimulate miR-21 expression in tumor-associated macrophages to prevent tumoricidal M1 polarization. However, augmented STAT1 signaling mediated by miR-21 deficiency upregulates PD-L1 expression in macrophages, which is known to inhibit phagocytic anti-tumor activity. This adverse effect can be alleviated by PD-1 blockade; indeed, miR-21 depletion in macrophages and PD-1 antibody treatment offer superior anti-tumor activity than either agent alone. These studies shed lights on potential application of the combination of miR-21 inhibition and   blockade to target the tumor microenvironment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29900055>pH regulators to target the tumor  microenvironment in human hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Interfering with tumor metabolism is an emerging strategy for treating cancers that are resistant to standard therapies. Featuring a rapid proliferation rate and exacerbated glycolysis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) creates a highly hypoxic microenvironment with excessive production of lactic and carbonic acids. These metabolic conditions promote disease aggressiveness and cancer-related immunosuppression. The pH regulatory molecules work as a bridge between tumor cells and their surrounding milieu. Herein, we show that the pH regulatory molecules CAIX, CAXII and V-ATPase are overexpressed in the HCC microenvironment and that interfering with their pathways exerts antitumor activity. Importantly, the V-ATPase complex was expressed by -like tumor-associated macrophages. Blocking  V-ATPase activity established a less -suppressive tumor microenvironment and reversed the mesenchymal features of HCC. Thus, targeting the unique cross-talk between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment played by pH regulatory molecules holds promise as a strategy to control HCC progression and to reduce the immunosuppressive pressure mediated by the hypoxic/acidic metabolism, particularly considering the potential combination of this strategy with emerging  -based immunotherapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25667500>Predictive biomarkers to chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma receiving the combination of cisplatin--vinblastine--temozolomide (PVT) as first-line treatment: a study of the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group (HECOG).</a></h2><p>Recent progress with BRAF and   inhibitors has dramatically changed the treatment landscape of metastatic melanoma (MM). The limited duration of responses to new agents, however, justifies the, still important, role of chemotherapy in the management of MM. This study prospectively explored biomarkers to first-line temozolomide-based chemotherapy.Tumor samples from patients with advanced MM who received first-line therapy with the PVT combination (cisplatin-vinblastine-temozolomide), i.e. cisplatin (CDDP) 30 mg/ (days 1-3) i.v., vinblastine (CVT) 2 mg/ (days 1-3) i.v., temozolomide (TMZ) 150 mg/ (days 1-5) orally, every 21 days, were collected. Biomarkers (MGMT, ERCC1, p16), were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and BRAF mutations by PCR/sequencing.Out of 35 patients included in this clinical phase II study, 12 objective response rates were achieved (ORR; 34%) including 1 complete response CR; 9 disease stabilisations (SD; 26%), with overall clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+SD) 60%, median response duration 6 months (95% confidence interval (CI)=2-16), median PFS 4 months (95% CI=2-6), median OS 12 months (95% CI=6-25) and 1-year survival rate 52%. From 24 tumor samples evaluated for biomarkers, 13 (54%) were BRAF mutated and 11 (46%) wild-type (wt). Patients with BRAF-mutated tumors showed better response rates compared to BRAF wild-type (39% vs. 27%) and improved PFS/OS. Sub-analyses, according to BRAF status, did not reveal any significant correlations with excision repair cross-complementation group 1 enzyme (ERCC1), however, in patients with BRAF-mutated tumors, low O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) nuclear expression correlated with better PFS, p=0.0384.First-line PVT chemotherapy for MM is efficacious and well-tolerated. Interesting 'hypothesis-generating' results show that candidate predictive biomarkers could identify subgroups of patients, i.e. tumors with BRAF mutation and low MGMT expression, with better outcomes following TMZ-based chemotherapy, thus warranting further evaluation in larger cohorts.Copyright© 2015 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.

Although cytotoxic antimelanoma drugs such as dacarbazine (DTIC), nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) and vincristine (VCR) have been used for the treatment of malignant melanoma as adjuvant therapy in Japan, the detailed mechanisms of their immunomodulatory effects are not fully understood. As the majority of TAMs are alternatively activated  macrophages that favour tumor development, the aim of this study was to elucidate the immunomodulatory effects of these reagents on human monocyte-derived  macrophages. First, mRNA expressions and protein production of   molecules, PD-L1 and chemokines by CD163 CD206  macrophages derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells were investigated to determine the immunomodulatory effects of DTIC, ACNU, and VCR. DTIC and VCR significantly decreased PD-L1 mRNA expression, which was confirmed by flow cytometry. Moreover, the mRNA expression and production of CCL22 were significantly decreased by DTIC, which suggested that DTIC might suppress the recruitment of Tregs in the tumor site. Furthermore, the decreased expression of PD-L1 and production of CCL22 were validated in vivo, using the B16F10 mouse melanoma model, leading to abrogation of the suppressive function of T- proliferation. The present report suggests one of the possible antimelanoma mechanisms of DAV combination chemotherapy for melanoma patients.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Therefore, there is growing interest in combining   blockade with chemotherapy and other treatments to enhance   blockade efficacy. Based on favorable clinical trial results, chemotherapy and immunotherapy combinations have been recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for frontline treatment for SCLC.Here, we show that combined treatment of SRA737, an oral CHK1 inhibitor, and anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) leads to an antitumor response in multiple cancer models, including SCLC. We further show that combining low, non-cytotoxic doses of gemcitabine with SRA737 + anti-PD-L1/anti-PD-1 significantly increased antitumorigenic CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, dendritic cells, and M1 macrophage populations in an SCLC model. This regimen also led to a significant decrease in immunosuppressive  macrophage and myeloid-derived suppressor  populations, as well as an increase in the expression of the type I interferon beta 1 gene, IFNβ, and chemokines, CCL5 and CXCL10.Given that anti-PD-L1/anti-PD-1 drugs have recently been approved as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of SCLC, and that the SRA737 + low dose gemcitabine regimen is currently in clinical trials for SCLC and other malignancies, our preclinical data provide a strong rational for combining this regimen with inhibitors of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway.Copyright © 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

Yet, macrophages are highly plastic and can also acquire an anti-tumorigenic M1-like phenotype. Here, we show that R848, an agonist of the toll-like receptors TLR7 and TLR8 identified in a morphometric-based screen, is a potent driver of the M1 phenotype in vitro and that R848-loaded β-cyclodextrin nanoparticles (CDNP-R848) lead to efficient drug delivery to tumour-associated macrophages in vivo. As a monotherapy, the administration of CDNP-R848 in multiple tumour models in mice altered the functional orientation of the tumour  microenvironment towards an M1 phenotype, leading to controlled tumour growth and protecting the animals against tumour rechallenge. When used in combination with the   inhibitor anti-PD-1, we observed improved immunotherapy response rates, including in a tumour model resistant to anti-PD-1 therapy alone. Our findings demonstrate the ability of rationally engineered drug-nanoparticle combinations to efficiently modulate tumour-associated macrophages for cancer immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31375632>Immuno-PET identifies the myeloid compartment as a key contributor to the outcome of the antitumor response under PD-1 blockade.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy using -blocking antibodies against PD-1 has produced impressive results in a wide range of cancers. However, the response remains heterogeneous among patients. We used noninvasive immuno-positron emission tomography (PET), using Zr-labeled PEGylated single-domain antibody fragments (nanobodies or VHHs), to explore the dynamics and distribution of intratumoral CD8 T cells and CD11b myeloid cells in response to anti-PD-1 treatment in the MC38 colorectal mouse adenocarcinoma model. Responding and nonresponding tumors showed consistent differences in the distribution of CD8 and CD11b cells. Anti-PD-1 treatment mobilized CD8 T cells from the tumor periphery to a more central location. Only those tumors fully infiltrated by CD8 T cells went on to complete resolution. All tumors contained CD11b myeloid cells from the outset of treatment, with later recruitment of additional CD11b cells. As tumors grew, the distribution of intratumoral CD11b cells became more heterogeneous. Shrinkage of tumors in responders correlated with an increase in the CD11b population in the center of the tumors. The changes in distribution of CD8 and CD11b cells, as assessed by PET, served as biomarkers to gauge the efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment. Single- RNA sequencing of RNA from intratumoral CD45 cells showed that CD11b cells in responders and nonresponders were markedly different. The responders exhibited a dominant population of macrophages with an M1-like signature, while the CD45 population in the nonresponders displayed an -like transcriptional signature. Thus, by using immuno-PET and single- RNA sequencing, we show that anti-PD-1 treatment not only affects interactions of CD8 T cells with the tumor but also impacts the intratumoral myeloid compartment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28674082>Intratumoral STING Activation with T-  Modulation Generates Systemic Antitumor Immunity.</a></h2><p>Coordinated manipulation of independent  regulatory pathways in the tumor microenvironment-including blockade of T-  receptors and reversal of suppressive myeloid programs-can render aggressive cancers susceptible to  rejection. Elevated toxicity associated with combination immunotherapy, however, prevents translation of the most efficacious regimens. We evaluated T- -modulating antibodies targeting CTLA-4, PD-1, and 4-1BB together with myeloid agonists targeting either STING or Flt3 in the TRAMP-C2 model of prostate cancer to determine whether low-dose intratumoral delivery of these agents could elicit systemic control of multifocal disease. Intratumoral administration of the STING agonist cyclic di-GMP (CDG) or Flt3 Ligand (Flt3L) augmented the therapeutic effect of systemic triple  modulation and promoted the cure of 75% of mice with bilateral TRAMP-C2; however, when all agents were administered locally, only CDG mobilized abscopal immunity. Combination efficacy correlated with globally enhanced ratios of CD8 T cells to regulatory T cells (Treg), macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and downregulation of the  marker CD206 on tumor-associated macrophages. Flt3L improved CD8 T- and dendritic  infiltration of tumors, but was diminished in efficacy by concomitant Treg expansion. Although intratumoral CDG/ therapy invokes substantial ulceration at the injection site, reduced CDG dosing can preserve tissue integrity without sacrificing therapeutic benefit. For high-order combinations of T-  antibodies and local myeloid agonists, systemic antibody administration provides the greatest efficacy; however, local administration of CDG and antibody provides substantial systemic benefit while minimizing the potential for -related adverse events. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433212>Vaccine against gastrin, a polyclonal antibody stimulator, decreases pancreatic cancer metastases.</a></h2><p>Growth of pancreatic cancer is stimulated by gastrin in both a paracrine and an autocrine fashion. Traditional therapies have not significantly improved survival, and recently pancreatic cancer has been deemed a "cold" tumor due to its poor response to immunotherapy. Strategies to improve survival of pancreatic cancer are desperately needed. In the current investigation, we studied the effects of an anti-gastrin cancer vaccine, polyclonal antibody stimulator (PAS; formerly called G17DT and Gastrimmune), used alone or in combination with a programmed  death receptor (PD)-1   antibody on pancreatic cancer growth, metastases, and the tumor microenvironment (TME). -competent female C57BL/6 mice bearing syngeneic orthotopic murine pancreatic cancer treated with PAS had significantly smaller tumors and fewer metastases. Examination of the TME demonstrated decreased fibrosis with fewer  and more M1 tumor-associated macrophages. Expression of the  gene was significantly increased and expression of the  gene was decreased compared with controls. Mice treated with PAS or the combination of PAS and PD-1 antibody exhibited significantly less tumor expression of phospho-paxillin, the focal adhesion protein β-catenin, and matrix metalloproteinase-7. This study suggests that inhibition of the cancer-promoting effects of gastrin in pancreatic cancer can decrease metastases by altering the TME and decreasing pathways that activate the epithelial mesenchymal transition. The PAS vaccine appears to change the TME, making it more susceptible to therapy with an   antibody. This novel combination of two immunotherapies may improve survival of pancreatic cancer by decreasing both tumor growth and metastasis formation. Survival from advanced pancreatic cancer is poor, in part due to dense fibrosis of the tumor microenvironment, increased number of -polarized macrophages that promote angiogenesis and invasion, and lack of "target-specific" therapy. Herein, we report that a tumor vaccine that selectively targets gastrin decreases pancreatic cancer growth and metastases. Furthermore, the gastrin vaccine polyclonal antibody stimulator alters the tumor microenvironment rendering it more responsive to immunotherapy with a programmed  death receptor-1   antibody.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28932633>CD163-positive tumor-associated macrophages and CD8-positive cytotoxic lymphocytes are powerful diagnostic markers for the therapeutic stratification of osteosarcoma patients: An immunohistochemical analysis of the biopsies fromthe French OS2006 phase 3 trial.</a></h2><p>The French phase 3 trial (OS 2006) testing zoledronic acid, an osteoclast inhibitor, with chemotherapy and surgery did not improve the outcome of patients with osteosarcoma (OS). To understand this unexpected result, the presence of infiltrating  cells was investigated in 124 pre-therapeutic biopsies of patients enrolled in the trial. The percentage of CD68/CD163 tumor-infiltrating macrophages (TAMs), CD8 lymphocytes, osteoclasts, and the PD1/PDL-1  were assessed by immunohistochemistry. M1/ macrophage polarization was characterized by pSTAT1/CMAF staining. The expression of these biomarkers was correlated with clinical outcome. No statistical correlations were found with response to chemotherapy. High CD163 levels (>50% of cells per core; 43.8% of patients) were associated with CMAF nuclear expression and significantly correlated with better overall survival ( = 0.0025) and longer metastasis progression-free survival (MPFS,  = 0.0315) independently of metastatic status ( = 0.002). Only a trend was observed for patients with high CD68-positive cells ( = 0.0582). CD8 staining was positive in >50% of cases with a median staining of 1%. Lower CD8 levels were associated with metastatic disease at diagnosis and the presence of CD8-positive cells significantly correlated with improved overall survival in zoledronate-treated patients ( = 0.0415). PD1/PDL-1 staining was negative in >80% of cases and was not correlated with outcome. Finally, CD163-positive TAMs and CD8 positive cells are crucial prognostic biomarkers in OS, whereas PD1/PDL-1  plays a minor role. For the first time, we described a correlation between CD8 positive cells and survival in zoledronate-treated patients.

In recent years, the role of  cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) has become a major area of interest. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of heterogeneity in   content and  expression in MPM in relation to prognosis and prediction of treatment efficacy. Generally, -suppressive cells such as  macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells are present within the TME, with extensive heterogeneity in  numbers. Infiltration of effector cells such as cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells and T helper cells is commonly found, also with substantial patient to patient heterogeneity. PD-L1 expression also varied greatly (16-65%). The infiltration of  cells in tumor and associated stroma holds key prognostic and predictive implications. As such, there is a strong rationale for thoroughly mapping the TME to better target therapy in mesothelioma. Researchers should be aware of the extensive possibilities that exist for a tumor to evade the cytotoxic killing from the  system. Therefore, no "one size fits all" treatment is likely to be found and focus should lie on the heterogeneity of the tumors and TME.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29721394>Merkel  carcinoma expresses the immunoregulatory ligand CD200 and induces immunosuppressive macrophages and regulatory T cells.</a></h2><p>Merkel  carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive skin cancer that responds to PD-1/PD-L1   inhibitors. CD200 is another  modulator whose receptor is found on tumor-promoting myeloid cells, including  macrophages. We found high  mRNA expression in MCC tumors, and CD200 immunostaining was demonstrated on 95.5% of MCC tumors. CD200R-expressing myeloid cells were present in the MCC tumor microenvironment. MCC-associated macrophages had a higher average CD163:CD68 staining ratio (2.67) than controls (1.13), indicating an immunosuppressive  phenotype. Accordingly, MCC tumors contained increased densities of FOXP3 regulatory T-cells. Intravenous administration of blocking anti-CD200 antibody to MCC xenograft mice revealed specific targeting of drug to tumor. In conclusion, MCC are highly CD200 positive and associated with immunosuppressive  macrophages and regulatory T-cells. As anti-CD200 antibody effectively targets CD200 on MCC tumor cells , this treatment may provide a novel immunotherapy for MCC independent of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27903651>T Cells Encountering Myeloid Cells Programmed for Amino Acid-dependent Immunosuppression Use Rictor/mTORC2 Protein for Proliferative  Decisions.</a></h2><p>Modulation of T  proliferation and function by immunoregulatory myeloid cells are an essential means of preventing self-reactivity and restoring tissue homeostasis. Consumption of amino acids such as arginine and tryptophan by immunoregulatory macrophages is one pathway that suppresses local T  proliferation. Using a reduced complexity in vitro macrophage-T  co-culture system, we show that macrophage arginase-1 is the only factor required by  macrophages to block T cells in G, and this effect is mediated by l-arginine elimination rather than metabolite generation. Tracking how T cells adjust their metabolism when deprived of arginine revealed the significance of macrophage-mediated arginine deprivation to T cells. We found mTORC1 activity was unaffected in the initial G block. After 2 days of arginine deprivation, mTORC1 activity declined paralleling a selective down-regulation of SREBP target gene expression, whereas mRNAs involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and T  activation were unaffected.   arrest was reversible at any point by exogenous arginine, suggesting starved T cells remain poised awaiting nutrients. Arginine deprivation-induced   arrest was mediated in part by Rictor/mTORC2, providing evidence that this nutrient recognition pathway is a central component of how T cells measure environmental arginine.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30738349>RRx-001 Acts as a Dual Small Molecule  Inhibitor by Downregulating CD47 on Cancer Cells and SIRP-α on Monocytes/Macrophages.</a></h2><p>RRx-001 is a pleiotropic anticancer agent in phase III clinical trials, which polarizes tumor-associated macrophages from a low phagocytic  phenotype to a high phagocytic M1 phenotype. One of the ways in which tumors promote  polarization and evade macrophage-mediated destruction is through upregulation of CD47 expression. As a myeloid-specific  , CD47 interacts with signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) on macrophages and monocytes to prevent phagocytosis. Herein, the effect of RRx-001 on CD47 and SIRPα expression was evaluated as well as its activity in vivo in macrophage-depleted tumors. In vitro, RRx-001 was found to decrease the expression levels of CD47 and SIRPα on tumor cells and monocytes/macrophages, respectively, reducing the phagocytosis inhibitory function of the CD47/SIRPα interaction. In vivo, macrophage depletion by clodronate in an A549 xenograft-bearing mouse model attenuated the ability of RRx-001 to suppress tumor growth, which suggests that the presence of infiltrated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment is a sine qua non condition for the antitumor activity of RRx-001. Furthermore, these in vitro effects translate into significant antitumor activity in mouse models of lung cancer. Importantly, unlike anti-CD47 antibodies, RRx-001, which has been evaluated in close to 300 patients in 9 clinical trials, is not associated with any hematologic toxicities. On the basis of demonstrated antitumor activity and minimal toxicity in phase II clinical trials, RRx-001 has received clearance from the FDA and the EMA for phase III, multicenter studies in subjects with relapsed/refractory solid tumors.Copyright © 2018.

To elucidate mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance, we assessed  parameters in resected human PDA. We demonstrate significant interpatient variability in T- number, localization, and phenotype. CD8 T cells, Foxp3 regulatory T cells, and PD-1 and PD-L1 cells were preferentially enriched in tertiary lymphoid structures that were found in most tumors compared with stroma and tumor  nests. Tumors containing more CD8 T cells also had increased granulocytes, CD163 ( immunosuppressive phenotype) macrophages, and FOXP3 regulatory T cells. PD-L1 was rare on tumor cells, but was expressed by CD163 macrophages and an additional stromal  subset commonly found clustered together adjacent to tumor epithelium. The majority of tumoral CD8 T cells did not express molecules suggestive of recent T- receptor (TCR) signaling. However, 41BBPD-1 T cells were still significantly enriched in tumors compared with circulation. Tumoral CD8PD-1 T cells commonly expressed additional inhibitory receptors, yet were mostly T-BET and EOMES, consistent with a less terminally exhausted state. Analysis of gene expression and rearranged TCR genes by deep sequencing suggested most patients have a limited tumor-reactive T- response. Multiplex immunohistochemistry revealed variable T- infiltration based on abundance and location, which may result in different mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance. Overall, the data support the need for therapies that either induce endogenous, or provide engineered, tumor-specific T- responses, and concurrently relieve suppressive mechanisms operative at the tumor site. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30407504>Identification and validation of novel microenvironment-based  molecular subgroups of head and neck squamous  carcinoma: implications for immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Targeting the   pathway has demonstrated antitumor cytotoxicity in treatment-refractory head and neck squamous  carcinoma (HNSC). To understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning its antitumor response, we characterized the  landscape of HNSC by their tumor and stromal compartments to identify novel  molecular subgroups.A training cohort of 522 HNSC samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas profiled by RNA sequencing was analyzed. We separated gene expression patterns from tumor, stromal, and   gene using a non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. We correlated the expression patterns with a set of -related gene signatures, potential  biomarkers, and clinicopathological features. Six independent datasets containing 838 HNSC samples were used for validation.Approximately 40% of HNSCs in the cohort (211/522) were identified to show enriched inflammatory response, enhanced cytolytic activity, and active interferon-γ signaling (all, P < 0.001). We named this new molecular class of tumors the  Class. Then we found it contained two distinct microenvironment-based subtypes, characterized by markers of active or exhausted  response. The Exhausted  Class was characterized by enrichment of activated stroma and anti-inflammatory  macrophage signatures, WNT/transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway activation and poor survival (all, P < 0.05). An enriched proinflammatory M1 macrophage signature, enhanced cytolytic activity, abundant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, high human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and favorable prognosis were associated with Active  Class (all, P < 0.05). The robustness of these  molecular subgroups was verified in the validation cohorts, and Active  Class showed potential response to programmed  death-1 blockade (P = 0.01).This study revealed a novel  Class in HNSC; two subclasses characterized by active or exhausted  responses were also identified. These findings provide new insights into tailoring immunotherapeutic strategies for different HNSC subgroups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30270458>Macrophage polarity in cancer: A review.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are the most abundant cells within the tumor stroma displaying noticeable plasticity, which allows them to perform several functions within the tumor microenvironment. Tumor-associated macrophages commonly refer to an alternative  phenotype, exhibiting anti-inflammatory and pro-tumoral effects.  cells are highly versatile and multi-tasking cells that directly influence multiple steps in tumor development, including cancer  survival, proliferation, stemness, and invasiveness along with angiogenesis and immunosuppression.  cells perform these functions through critical interactions with cells related to tumor progression, including Th2 cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, cancer cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells.  cells also have negative cross-talks with tumor suppressor cells, including cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells. Programed death-1 (PD-1) is one of the key receptors expressed in  cells that, upon interaction with its ligand PD-L1, plays cardinal roles for induction of  evasion in cancer cells. In addition,  cells can neutralize the effects of the pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor M1 phenotype. Classically activated M1 cells express high levels of major histocompatibility complex molecules, and the cells are strong killers of cancer cells. Therefore, orchestrating  reprogramming toward an M1 phenotype would offer a promising approach for reversing the fate of tumor and promoting cancer regression. Macrophage switching toward an anti-inflammatory M1 phenotype could be used as an adjuvant with other approaches, including radiotherapy and   blockades, such as anti-PD-L1/PD-1 strategies.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29081778>Pyruvate Kinase  Is Required for the Expression of the   PD-L1 in  Cells and Tumors.</a></h2><p>Blocking interaction of the   receptor PD-1 with its ligand PD-L1 is associated with good clinical outcomes in a broad variety of malignancies. High levels of PD-L1 promote tumor growth by restraining CD8 T- responses against tumors. Limiting PD-L1 expression and function is therefore critical for allowing the development of antitumor  responses and effective tumor clearance. Pyruvate kinase isoform  (PKM2) is also a key player in regulating cancer as well as  responses. PKM2 catalyzes the final rate-limiting step of glycolysis. Furthermore, PKM2 as a dimer translocates to the nucleus, where it stimulates hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (Hif-1α) transactivation domain function and recruitment of p300 to the hypoxia response elements (HRE) of Hif-1α target genes. Here, we provide the first evidence of a role for PKM2 in regulating the expression of PD-L1 on macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), T cells, and tumor cells. LPS-induced expression of PD-L1 in primary macrophages was inhibited by the PKM2 targeting compound TEPP-46. Furthermore, RNA silencing of PKM2 inhibited LPS-induced PD-L1 expression. This regulation occurs through direct binding of PKM2 and Hif-1α to HRE sites on the PD-L1 promoter. Moreover, TEPP-46 inhibited expression of PD-L1 on macrophages, DCs, and T cells as well as tumor cells in a mouse CT26 cancer model. These findings broaden our understanding of how PKM2 may contribute to tumor progression and may explain the upregulation of PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30170190>Therapeutic implication of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) targeting in cancer cells and tumor microenvironment by competitive and non-competitive inhibitors.</a></h2><p>The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) is a tyrosine kinase receptor for VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and placental growth factor (PlGF) ligands that is expressed in endothelial, myelomonocytic and tumor cells. VEGF-B and PlGF exclusively bind to VEGFR-1, whereas VEGF-A also binds to VEGFR-2. At variance with VEGFR-2, VEGFR-1 does not play a relevant role in physiological angiogenesis in the adult, while it is important in tumor-associated angiogenesis. VEGFR-1 and PlGF are expressed in a variety of tumors, promote invasiveness and contribute to resistance to anti-VEGF-A therapy. The currently approved antiangiogenic therapies for the treatment of a variety of solid tumors hamper VEGF-A signaling mediated by both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-1 [i.e., the monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-VEGF-A bevacizumab, the chimeric molecule aflibercept and several small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors] or exclusively by VEGFR-2 (i.e., the mAb anti-VEGFR-2 ramucirumab). However, molecules that interfere with VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling determine severe adverse effects due to inhibition of physiological angiogenesis and their efficacy is hampered by tumor infiltration of protumoral myeloid cells. Blockade of VEGFR-1 may exert anti-tumor activity by multiple mechanisms: a) inhibition of tumor-associated angiogenesis; b) reduction of myeloid progenitor mobilization and tumor infiltration by VEGFR-1 expressing  macrophages, which contribute to tumor progression and spreading; c) inhibition of invasiveness, vasculogenic mimicry and survival of VEGFR-1 positive tumor cells. As a consequence of these properties, molecules targeting VEGFR-1 are expected to produce less adverse effects and to counteract resistance towards anti-VEGF-A therapies. More interestingly, selective VEGFR-1 inhibition might enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy with   inhibitors. In this review, we will examine the experimental evidence available so far that supports targeting VEGFR-1 signal transduction pathway for cancer treatment by competitive inhibitors that prevent growth factor interaction with the receptor and non-competitive inhibitors that hamper receptor activation without affecting ligand binding.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Ionizing radiation induces tumor  death, which in turn can either elicit protective anti-tumor  responses or immunosuppression in the tumor micromilieu that contributes to local tumor recurrence. Immunosuppression is frequently accompanied by the attraction of immunosuppressive cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs),  tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), T regulatory cells (Tregs), N2 neutrophils, and by the release of immunosuppressive cytokines (TGF-β, IL-10) and chemokines.   pathways, particularly of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, have been determined as key regulators of cancer  escape. While IFN-dependent upregulation of PD-L1 has been extensively investigated, up-to-date studies indicated the importance of DNA damage signaling in the regulation of PD-L1 expression following RT. DNA damage dependent PD-L1 expression is upregulated by ATM/ATR/Chk1 kinase activities and cGAS/STING-dependent pathway, proving the role of DNA damage signaling in PD-L1 induced expression.  blockade immunotherapies (i.e., application of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies) combined with RT were shown to significantly improve the objective response rates in therapy of various primary and metastatic malignancies. Further improvements in the therapeutic potential of RT are based on combinations of RT with other immunotherapeutic approaches including vaccines, cytokines and cytokine inducers, and an adoptive   transfer (DCs, NK cells, T cells). In the current review we provide immunological rationale for a combination of RT with various immunotherapies as well as analysis of the emerging preclinical evidences for these therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589013>Lyophilizable and Multifaceted Toll-like Receptor 7/8 Agonist-Loaded Nanoemulsion for the Reprogramming of Tumor Microenvironments and Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>The low therapeutic efficacy of current cancer immunotherapy is related to nonimmunogenic and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TMEs). To overcome these limitations, both the  priming of antitumoral lymphocytes and the reprogramming of immunosuppressive factors in TMEs are essential. Here, we suggest a nanoemulsion (NE)-based immunotherapeutic platform that can not only modulate tumor-induced suppression but also induce an effective -mediated  response for T  proliferation. Multifunctional NEs can be fabricated by integrating the efficacy of NEs as delivery systems and the multifaceted immunomodulation characteristics (, immunostimulation and reprogramming of immunosuppression) of small molecule-based Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonists. Local  vaccination of melanoma and cervical tumor models with tumor antigens (protein and peptide) adjuvanted with NE loaded with TLR7/8 agonists [NE (TLR7/8a)] induced the recruitment and activation of innate  cells, infiltration of lymphocytes, and polarization of tumor-associated  macrophages, which resulted in inhibition of tumor growth and prolonged survival in both primary and rechallenged tumor models. Antibody-depletion experiments also suggested that macrophages, type I IFN (IFN-α and IFN-β), CD8 T cells, and NK1.1 cells contributed to the antitumor effect of NE (TLR7/8a). The combination of antitumoral lymphocytes and reprogramming of immunosuppressive TMEs induced by NE (TLR7/8a) treatment evoked a synergistic antitumor  response with   blockade therapy (anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651716>Using the Spleen as an  Systemic  Barometer Alongside Osteosarcoma Disease Progression and Immunotherapy with -PD-L1.</a></h2><p>Indications for immunotherapies are still unclear, and there is a great need for real-time patient  status monitoring. In this study, we confirmed that the local and systemic  profiles of an orthotopic osteosarcoma model with or without luciferase transfection were statistically equivalent. Next, we used flow cytometry to describe systemic   populations influenced by osteosarcoma disease progression. When compared to vehicle-inoculated sham mice, it was found that tumor-bearing mice had significant immunophenotype disturbances at approximately 11 weeks after inoculation (at which time 90% of primary tumor-bearing mice have fulminant pulmonary metastases). Percent populations of natural killer cells and T regulatory cells were increased in the spleens of tumor-bearing mice ( < 0.0083) compared to shams. Additionally, T lymphocytes from spleens of tumor-bearing mice showed increased Tim-3/PD-1 exhaustion status ( < 0.0083). There were also increases in the percent populations of myeloid cells and overall M1/ macrophage marker expression on tumor-bearing mice spleens versus controls ( < 0.00714). Finally, treatment with 20 g -PD-L1 decreased T- exhaustion back to sham status, with a corresponding increase in CTLA-4 expression on cytotoxic T cells in the majority of mice tested.  inhibition also increased splenic monocyte maturation and returned macrophage M1/ marker expression back to sham status. These data suggest that cancer induces systemic  dysregulation and that these changes may be elucidated and utilized for treatment purposes by sampling the systemic  environment via the spleen. In addition, treatment with the  inhibitor -PD-L1 may neutralize but not overcome the systemic immunological changes induced by a progressing malignancy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29805761>A high LDH to absolute lymphocyte count ratio in patients with DLBCL predicts for a poor intratumoral  response and inferior survival.</a></h2><p>To test the utility of the circulating Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) to absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ratio (LAR) to predict outcome to conventional first-line chemo-immunotherapy in Diffuse Large B- Lymphoma (DLBCL), and investigate its correlation to the tumour  microenvironment (TME).A population based cohort of 210 patients (median age: 64, range 18-90 years) with median follow up 3.8 years was analysed. All patients were treated with R-CHOP, and no immunosuppression related cases were included. Tissue for nanoString gene expression was available in 141.High (i.e. adverse) LAR was associated with inferior progression free and overall survival (PFS 45% vs. 78%; OS 56% vs 86%, both p<0.001) at 5-years. Patients with a high LAR had a strikingly different TME compared to patients with a low ratio. Low LAR was associated with a good-risk TME  gene signature (p<0.0001), including high CD8 and lower  macrophage infiltration. COO classification was not significantly different between high and low LAR patients. LAR was predictive of outcome independent of  of origin and the international prognostic index (IPI). In particular, LAR discriminated patients with high IPI (3-5), showing 5-year PFS and OS of 32% vs. 74% (p=0.0006), and 43% vs. 81% (p=0.0003). A combined nanoString based  score and the LAR allowed better prediction of outcome than either prognosticator alone (p<0.0001).The LAR reflects the TME within DLBCL, and is a strong predictor of outcome in DLBCL treated with conventional first-line therapy that is independent of and additive to the IPI. Further studies are required to determine if this easily applicable blood assay can determine patients that might benefit from   blockade.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620878>Combination of Sunitinib and PD-L1 Blockade Enhances Anticancer Efficacy of TLR7/8 Agonist-Based Nanovaccine.</a></h2><p>Cancer vaccines composed of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists have shown promising antitumor efficacy in preclinical studies by generating antigen-specific CD8 T cells, but translation of cancer vaccines to the clinic has been limited due to variables responses and development of resistance. The tumor microenvironment deploys various  escape mechanisms that neutralize CD8 T -mediated tumor rejection. Therefore, we hypothesized that modulation of the tumor microenvironment can augment CD8 T  activation and enhance therapeutic efficacy of cancer vaccines. To accomplish this, we aimed to eliminate  suppressive cells and block their inhibitory signaling. Combination of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sunitinib with a nanoparticle-based cancer vaccine (nanovaccine) resulted in the reduction of -suppressive myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Blockade of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) using anti-PD-L1 antibody was used to reduce CD8 T  exhaustion. Combination of nanovaccine+sunitinib+PD-L1 antibody treatment reduced PD-L1  macrophages and MDSCs and upregulated activation of CD8 T cells in the tumor. Nanovaccine+sunitinib+PD-L1 antibody treatment also stimulated antigen-specific CD8 T  response, which led to improved therapeutic efficacy in MB49 and B16F10 murine tumor models. These results suggest that modulation of tumor microenvironment using sunitinib and PD-L1 blockade can significantly enhance the antitumor efficacy of cancer nanovaccine.</p></html>
