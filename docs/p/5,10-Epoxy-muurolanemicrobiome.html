<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667426>Oregano: A potential prophylactic treatment for the intestinal .</a></h1><p>Prophylactic use of antibiotics in poultry diets has been identified as a problematic practice because of its potential to exacerbate the spread of antibiotic resistance to human pathogens. A range of countries have opted to completely ban the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The animal production industries are looking for alternative ways to effectively control pathogens while providing the performance benefits previously secured by antibiotics in feed. Here, we present evidence that oregano () could be a potential alternative for pathogen control in the poultry industry. Broiler diets were supplemented with oregano powder (0%, 0.%, 1%, and 2%) for six weeks. The capacity for pathogen control was estimated by  profiling of the jejunum, ileum, and caecum content, and in the faeces, by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The concentrations of short-chain fatty acids in the caecal content were also measured, as were villus/crypt parameters in the ileum. There were no differences among treatments in weight gain, feed intake, or the concentration of short-chain fatty acids. The height, width, and the surface area of villi in the ileum were not influenced by oregano addition. However, 1% and 2% of oregano produced a significant increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. There were no visible histopathological changes in the liver in control and treated groups. Although oregano had no significant effect on overall microbial diversity and gross composition, some specific genera, like ,  and , which include known pathogens, were reduced in relative abundance by oregano treatment. , recognized as a beneficial and probiotic genus, was also suppressed by the oregano treatment.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590758>Impact of dietary ingredients on the interpretation of various fecal parameters in rats fed inulin.</a></h1><p>In the present study, the influences of diets (i.e. chow and AIN-93 diets) on the interpretation of various fecal parameters including viable , moisture, weight, and short-chain fatty acids in rats fed different amounts of inulin (0.-2 g/kg). Eight groups of rats (n = 8/group) were fed, for 4 weeks, chow or AIN-93 diets with or without inulin supplementation. Fecal samples were analyzed for different fecal parameters. After a 2-week adaptation, apparent differences in some fecal parameters were observed between the chow and AIN-93 diet groups. Throughout the 4-week intervention period, significantly (p < 0.05) higher Lactobacillus spp. counts, fecal moisture (∼2.7-fold), and fecal weight (∼.8-fold) were observed with chow diet over AIN-93 diet. More specifically, significant elevations in the levels of Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., fecal moisture, and fecal weight could be observed at low-dose (0. g/kg) of inulin in chow diet groups, while most of these changes could merely be seen at medium-dose (1 g/kg) in AIN-93 diet groups. These results demonstrated that the choice of experimental diets would affect the comparison of fecal parameters as well as the interpretation of effective dosage of prebiotic in intestinal health assessments.Copyright © 2019.

Based on the findings of the screen and subsequent well assays with cell free supernatants and whole cell extracts, one strain, designated CIT060, was selected for further investigation. It was identified as Staphylococcus capitis and herein we describe the purification and characterisation of the novel bacteriocin that the strain produces. This bacteriocin which we have named capidermicin was extracted from the cell-free supernatant of S. capitis CIT060 and purified to homogeneity using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometric (MS) analysis revealed that the capidermicin peptide has a mass of ,464 Da. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) experiments showed that capidermicin was active in the micro-molar range against all the Gram-positive bacteria that were tested. Antimicrobial activity was retained over a range of pHs (2-11) and temperatures (10-121°C x 15 mins). The draft genome sequence of S. capitis CIT060 was determined and the genes predicted to be involved in the biosynthesis of capidermicin were identified. These genes included the predicted capidermicin precursor gene, and genes that are predicted to encode a membrane transporter, an immunity protein and a transcriptional regulator. Homology searches suggest that capidermicin is a novel member of the family of class II leaderless bacteriocins.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599542>The in vitro activity of selected mouthrinses on the reference strains of Trichomonas tenax and Entamoeba gingivalis</a></h1><p>Protozoa, such as Trichomonas tenax, Entamoeba gingivalis and Leishmania braziliensis, may be present in the mouth but their role in the pathophysiology of oral diseases is not clear yet. The use of various types of mouthrinses plays an important role in maintaining proper oral hygiene and in removing some of the microbial components from the oral cavity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of selected mouthrinses on the reference strains of Trichomonas tenax and Entamoeba gingivalis which can be a part of the oral cavity . Two standard strains Trichomonas tenax (ATCC 30207) and Entamoeba gingivalis (ATCC 30927) were used and metronidazole as a drug used in the treatment of infections caused by protozoa as well as fourteen agents used as mouthwashes were tested, with two pure compounds acting as mouthrinse ingredients, i.e. 20% benzocaine and 0.2% chlorhexidine, as well as 12 commercially-available formulas: Azulan, Colgate Plax Complete Care Sensitive, Corsodyl 0.2%, Curasept ADS 205, Dentosept, Dentosept A, Eludril Classic, Listerine Total Care, Octenidol, Oral-B Pro-Expert Clinic Line, Sylveco and Tinctura salviae. The protozoonicidal activity of the preparations was evaluated on the basis of the ratio of dead to living ratios after incubation in an incubator (37°C) for 1, 10 and 30 min. Protozoa were counted in the Bürker chamber in each case up to 100 cells in an optical microscope (over 400×). The criterion for the death of protozoa was the lack of movement and changes in the shape and characteristics of cell disintegration. The curves of activity were obtained after experiments conducted for –7 different solutions of each preparation. On the basis of the curves, the solution killing 50% of the population (CL50) was calculated. All mouthrinses tested in this work in their undiluted form acted lethally on both protozoa. Benzocaine, used as a local anesthetic, has etiotropic properties which can be useful for supporting antiprotozoal treatment. Chlorhexidine confirmed its high efficiency in the eradication of potentially pathogenic protozoa. The use of mouthrinses is an important complement for other procedures intended to maintain correct oral hygiene.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670358>Effect of supplementation of nicotinamide and sodium butyrate on the growth performance, liver mitochondrial function and gut  of broilers at high stocking density.</a></h1><p>This study was conducted to investigate the effects of stocking density and dietary nicotinamide (NAM) and butyrate sodium (BA) supplementation on the growth performance, liver mitochondrial function and gut  of broilers at high stocking density. A total of 342, 26-d-old Cobb500 broilers were divided into  groups with 6 replicates. Treatments were as follows: (a) Low stocking density (L, 9 birds per cage); (b) High stocking density (H, 12 birds per cage); (c) H + 50 ppm NAM; (d) H + 500 ppm BA; (e) H + 50 ppm NAM + 500 ppm BA (COMB). The results showed that high stocking density significantly reduced the feed intake and body weight gain of broilers, while COMB improved the growth performance at high stocking density. High stocking density significantly reduced the liver metallothionein content, liver mitochondrial membrane potential and the activities of Na+K+-ATPase and Ca2+Mg2+-ATPase. In contrast, the liver metallothionein contents in the NAM, BA and COMB fed group were higher than those in the H group. COMB increased the activity of ATPase as well, but it failed to enhance the mitochondrial membrane potential. Stocking density also affected gut  of broilers. The high-density group increased the relative abundance of Blautia. Supplementation of BA and NAM increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, respectively. In conclusion, a combination of NAM and BA can improve the performance, antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial function and intestinal  of broilers at high stocking density.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572332>Efficacy of Fecal Sampling as a Gut Proxy in the Study of Chicken Gut .</a></h1><p>Despite the convenience and non-invasiveness of fecal sampling, the fecal  does not fully represent that of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and the efficacy of fecal sampling to accurately represent the gut  in birds is poorly understood. In this study, we aim to identify the efficacy of feces as a gut proxy in birds using chickens as a model. We collected 1,026 samples from 206 chickens, including duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and feces samples, for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analyses. In this study, the efficacy of feces as a gut proxy was partitioned to microbial community membership and community structure. Most taxa in the small intestine (84.11-87.28%) and ceca (99.39%) could be identified in feces. Microbial community membership was reflected with a gut anatomic feature, but community structure was not. Excluding shared microbes, the small intestine and ceca contributed 34.12 and .83% of the total fecal members, respectively. The composition of Firmicutes members in the small intestine and that of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria members in the ceca could be well mirrored by the observations in fecal samples (ρ = 0.54-0.71 and 0.71-0.78, respectively,  < 0.001). However, there were few significant correlations for each genus between feces and each of the four gut segments, and these correlations were not high (ρ = -0.2-0.4,  < 0.05) for most genera. Our results suggest that fecal microbial community has a good potential to identify most taxa in the chicken gut and could moderately mirror the microbial structure in the intestine at the microbial population level with phylum specificity. However, it should be interpreted with caution by using feces as a proxy to study associations for microbial structure at individual microorganism level.Copyright © 2019 Yan, Sun, Zheng, Wen, Ji, Zhang, Chen, Hou and Yang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602309> genus associated with visceral fat accumulation in adults 20-76 years of age.</a></h1><p>The gut  is reported to be related to obesity, and visceral fat is reported to be strongly associated with cardiovascular disease and overall mortality. However, the association between the gut  and obesity has mainly been studied using body mass index (BMI) as a proxy for obesity. We investigated the relationship of both visceral fat and BMI with the gut  stratified by sex in a population-based cross-sectional study of Japanese men and women 20-76 years of age ( = 1001). Women with a higher visceral fat area (VFA) harboured a higher relative abundance of the Firmicutes phylum ( for trend <0.001) and a lower relative abundance of the Bacteroidetes phylum ( for trend 0.030), whereas men with higher VFA harboured a lower relative abundance of the Firmicutes phylum ( for trend 0.076) and a higher relative abundance of the Bacteroidetes phylum ( for trend 0.013). Similar results were obtained using BMI as an index, but the differences were not significant in men. At the genus level,  was the only gut microbe significantly and inversely associated with VFA regardless of sex. In conclusion, at the genus level we found that  was the only gut microbe significantly and inversely associated with VFA, regardless of sex.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649644>Caecal  of Experimentally Infected Chickens at Different Ages.</a></h1><p> is the most common bacterial cause of foodborne zoonosis in the European Union. Infections are often linked to the consumption and handling of poultry meat. The aim of the present study was to investigate the caecal  of birds infected with  at different ages. Therefore, a total of 180 birds of the laying hybrid Lohmann Brown-Classic were housed in 12 subgroups of 15 animals each in three performed repetitions. Three birds per subgroup were experimentally infected with  at an age of about 21 days and about 78 days (4.46 ± 0.35 log CFU/bird). Twenty-one days after experimental infection,  studies were performed on 72 caecal samples of dissected birds (three primary infected and three further birds/subgroup). Amplification within the hypervariable region V 4 of the 16S rRNA gene was performed and sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq platform. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide (version 7.1) and R (version 3..2). Both factors, the experimental replication ( < 0.001) and the chickens' age at infection ( < 0.001) contributed significantly to the differences in microbial composition of the caecal samples. The factor experimental replication explained 24% of the sample's variability, whereas the factor age at infection explained 14% thereof. Twelve of 32 families showed a significantly different count profile between the two age groups, whereby strongest differences were seen for seven families, among them the family  (adjusted  = 0.003). The strongest difference between age groups was seen for a bacterial species that is assigned to the genus  which in turn belongs to the family  (adjusted  < 0.0001). Correlation analyses revealed a common relationship in both chicken ages at infection between the absolute abundance of  and , which consists of the genus  In general, concentrations of particular volatile fatty acids (VFA) demonstrated a negative correlation to absolute abundance of , whereby the strongest link was seen for n-butyrate (-0.51141;  < 0.0001). Despite performing consecutive repetitions, the factor experimental replication contributed more to the differences of microbial composition in comparison to the factor age at infection.Copyright © 2019 Hankel, Jung, Kuder, Keller, Keller, Galvez, Strowig and Visscher.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611994>Characteristics of fecal gut  in patients with colorectal cancer at different stages and different sites.</a></h1><p>Numerous studies have revealed that the gut  serves an important role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). The present study aimed to investigate the populations present in the gut  in patients with CRC of different stages and at different sites. Fecal samples were obtained from 67 CRC patients and 30 healthy controls, which were analyzed by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Increased diversity of the fecal gut  in patients with CRC was reported compared with the healthy controls. In the present study, at the genus level, the relative abundances of  and  in the gut  of CRC patients were substantially increased compared with healthy controls, while the relative abundance of  was significantly lower. In addition, differences in the fecal gut  were also compared between patients with stage I-IV CRC and healthy controls. The results revealed that the abundances of the genera  and  were significantly increased in patients with CRC stage I compared with the healthy controls, while  was enriched in patients with stage III CRC compared with patients with stage IV. Furthermore, the present study reported that the genera  and  were more abundant in the proximal segments than in the distal segments of the colon. In conclusion, despite the low number of samples employed in the present study, a signature of genera indicating dysbiosis of the gut  of patients with stage I-IV CRC patients was proposed, which may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the progression of CRC. These findings are also valuable for developing novel fecal diagnostic methods and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CRC.Copyright: © Sheng et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592358>Soil bacterial biodiversity is driven by long-term pasture management, poultry litter, and cattle manure inputs.</a></h1><p>Soil microorganisms are important for maintaining soil health, decomposing organic matter, and recycling nutrients in pasture systems. However, the impact of long-term conservation pasture management on soil microbial communities remains unclear. Therefore, soil  responses to conservation pasture management is an important component of soil health, especially in the largest agricultural land-use in the US. The aim of this study was to identify soil  community differences following 13-years of pasture management (hayed (no cattle), continuously grazed, rotationally grazed with a fenced, un-grazed and unfertilized buffer strip, and a control (no poultry litter or cattle manure inputs)). Since 2004, all pastures (excluding the control) received annual poultry litter at a rate of .6 Mg ha. Soil samples were collected at a 0-15 cm depth from 2016-2017 either pre or post poultry litter applications, and bacterial communities were characterized using Illumina 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Overall, pasture management influenced soil microbial community structure, and effects were different by year ( < 0.05). Soils receiving no poultry litter or cattle manure had the lowest richness (Chao). Continuously grazed systems had greater ( < 0.05) soil community richness, which corresponded with greater soil pH and nutrients. Consequently, continuously grazed systems may increase soil diversity, owing to continuous nutrient-rich manure deposition; however, this management strategy may adversely affect aboveground plant communities and water quality. These results suggest conservation pasture management (e.g., rotationally grazed systems) may not improve microbial diversity, albeit, buffer strips were reduced nutrients and bacterial movement as evident by low diversity and fertility in these areas compared to areas with manure or poultry litter inputs. Overall, animal inputs (litter or manure) increased soil  diversity and may be a mechanism for improved soil health.©2019 Yang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572723>Gene Co-expression Analysis Identifies Histone Deacetylase  and 9 Expression in Midbrain Dopamine Neurons and as Regulators of Neurite Growth via Bone Morphogenetic Protein Signaling.</a></h1><p>Parkinson's disease is characterized by the intracellular accumulation of α-synuclein which has been linked to early dopaminergic axonal degeneration. Identifying druggable targets that can promote axonal growth in cells overexpressing α-synuclein is important in order to develop strategies for early intervention. Class-IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) have previously emerged as druggable targets, however, it is not known which specific class-IIa HDACs should be targeted to promote neurite growth in dopaminergic neurons. To provide insight into this, we used gene co-expression analysis to identify which, if any, of the class-IIa HDACs had a positive correlation with markers of dopaminergic neurons in the human substantia nigra. This revealed that two histone deacetylases,  and , are co-expressed with  and  in the human SN. We further found that HDAC5 and HDAC9 are expressed in dopaminergic neurons in the adult mouse substantia nigra. We show that siRNAs targeting  or  can promote neurite growth in SH-SY5Y cells, and that their pharmacological inhibition, using the drug MC1568, promoted neurite growth in cultured rat dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, MC1568 treatment upregulated the expression of the neurotrophic factor, , and its downstream transcription factor, . In addition, MC1568 or siRNAs targeting  or  led to an increase in Smad-dependent GFP expression in a reporter assay. Furthermore, MC1568 treatment of cultured rat dopaminergic neurons increased cellular levels of phosphorylated Smad1, which was prevented by the BMP receptor inhibitor, dorsomorphin. Dorsomorphin treatment prevented the neurite growth-promoting effects of siRNAs targeting HDAC5, as did overexpression of dominant-negative Smad4 or of the inhibitory Smad7, demonstrating a functional link to BMP signaling. Supplementation with BMP2 prevented the neurite growth-inhibitory effects of nuclear-restricted HDAC5. Finally, we report that siRNAs targeting  or  promoted neurite growth in cells overexpressing wild-type or A53T-α-synuclein and that MC1568 protected cultured rat dopaminergic neurons against the neurotoxin, MPP. These findings establish HDAC5 and HDAC9 as novel regulators of BMP-Smad signaling, that additionally may be therapeutic targets worthy of further exploration in iPSC-derived human DA neurons and  models of Parkinson's disease.Copyright © 2019 Mazzocchi, Wyatt, Mercatelli, Morari, Morales-Prieto, Collins, Sullivan and O’Keeffe.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670167>Reduction in pathogenic load of wheat by tempering with saline organic acid solutions at different seasonal temperatures.</a></h1><p>As a raw agricultural commodity, wheat is exposed to microbial contamination; therefore, enteric pathogens may be among its  creating a food safety risk in milled products. This research evaluates (1) the effectiveness of organic acids dissolved in saline solutions to reduce the counts of pathogenic microorganisms in soft and hard wheat, and also investigates the effect of seasonal temperature on (2) survivability of pathogens in wheat kernels and on (3) pathogen inactivation during tempering with saline organic acid solutions. Wheat samples were inoculated with cocktails of either  serovars of Salmonella enterica,  E. coli O157:H7 or 6 non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strains to achieve a concentration of ~7 log CFU/g. Inoculated samples were allowed to stand for 7-days at temperatures (2.0, 10.8, 24.2, 32 °C) corresponding to those experienced during winter, spring/fall, and summer (average and maximum) in the main wheat growing regions in the state of Nebraska, USA. Besides water, solutions containing acid (acetic or lactic 2.% or .0% v/v) and NaCl (~26% w/v) were used for tempering the wheat to 15.0% (soft) and 15.% (hard) moisture at the different seasonal temperatures. The survival of pathogenic microorganisms throughout the resting period, and before and after tempering was analyzed by plating samples on injury-recovery media. The survival rate of pathogenic microorganisms on wheat kernels was higher at temperatures experienced during the winter (2.0 °C) and spring/fall (10.8 °C) months. Regardless of tempering temperature, the initial pathogen load was reduced significantly by all solutions when compared to the control tempered with water (P ≤ .05). The combination of lactic acid (.0%) and NaCl was the most effective treatment against Salmonella enterica, E. coli O157:H7 and non-O157 STEC, with average reduction values of 1.8, 1.8 and 1.6 log CFU/g for soft wheat and 2.6, 2.4 and 2.4 log CFU/g for hard wheat, respectively. Implementation of organic acids and NaCl in tempering water may have the potential to reduce the risk of pathogen contamination in milled products.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to elucidate this possible association by summarizing all available data.A literature search utilizing MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception until August 2019 was conducted. Eligible studies included either cohort studies or cross-sectional studies that consisted of two groups of participants, those with obesity and those without obesity, and compared the prevalence of SIBO between the groups. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) from each study were consolidated by the generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird.A total of five studies with 515 patients fulfilled eligibility criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. The risk of SIBO among individuals with obesity was higher than in individuals without obesity but did not reach statistical significance with a pooled OR of 2.08 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82-.31; p = 0.12; I 84%]. Sensitivity analysis including only studies from Western countries increased the pooled OR to 3.41 and reached statistical significance (95% CI 1.21-9.59; p = 0.02; I 62%).This meta-analysis found that the risk of SIBO was about two times higher among individuals with obesity compared to individuals without obesity, although the result did not reach statistical significance. The risk increased to threefold and reached statistical significance when only studies from Western countries were included.

Modulation of FXR and TGR5 activation have been demonstrated to impact the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1, insulin and glucagon as well as energy expenditure and gut  composition with potential beneficial effects on glucose metabolism.A search strategy based on literature searches in pubmed.org with various combinations of the key words FXR, TGR5, agonist, apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), bile acid sequestrant, metformin and glucose metabolism has been applied to obtain material for the present review. Furthermore, manual searches including scanning of reference lists in relevant papers and conference proceedings have been performed.This review provides an outline of the link between bile acid and glucose metabolism, with a special focus on the gluco-metabolic impact of treatment modalities with modulating effects on bile acid physiology; including FXR agonists, TGR5 agonists, ASBT inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants and metformin.Any potential beneficial gluco-metabolic effects of FXR-agonists remain to be established, whereas the clinical relevance of TGR5-based treatment modalities seems limited due to substantial safety concerns of TGR5 agonists observed in animal models. The glucose-lowering effects of ASBT inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants and metformin are at least partly mediated by modulation of bile acid circulation, which might allow an optimization of these bile acid modulating treatment modalities.© Endocrine Society 2019.

In addition, we studied the gene expression profile of zebrafish fed with mastic oil-supplemented diet using microarray analysis. Our results showed that the hair cells of lateral line neuromasts are functional upon exposure of zebrafish larvae up to 20 ppm of mastic essential oil, while treatment with higher concentrations, 100 and 200 ppm, resulted in increased larvae mortality. Dietary supplementation of zebrafish with mastic essential oil led to differential expression of interferon response-related genes as well as the immune responsive gene 1 () that links cellular metabolism with immune defense. Notably, , a constituent of the mucus hydrogel that protects the host against invading pathogens, was up-regulated. Our in vivo work provides information concerning the safety of mastic essential oil use and suggests dietary effects on gene expression related with the physical and immunochemical properties of the gastrointestinal system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662429>Changes in the Composition of the Gut  and the Blood Transcriptome in Preterm Infants at Less than 29 Weeks Gestation Diagnosed with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia.</a></h1><p>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung condition in preterm infants that results in abnormal lung development and leads to considerable morbidity and mortality, making BPD one of the most common complications of preterm birth. We employed RNA sequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile gene expression in blood and the composition of the fecal  in infants born at <29 weeks gestational age and diagnosed with BPD in comparison to those of preterm infants that were not diagnosed with BPD. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, performed longitudinally on 255 fecal samples collected from 50 infants in the first months of life, identified significant differences in the relative levels of abundance of , and  in the BPD infants in a manner that was birth mode dependent. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed that more than 400 genes were upregulated in infants with BPD. Genes upregulated in BPD infants were significantly enriched for functions related to red blood cell development and oxygen transport, while several immune-related pathways were downregulated. We also identified a gene expression signature consistent with an enrichment of immunosuppressive CD71 early erythroid cells in infants with BPD. Intriguingly, genes that were correlated in their expression with the relative abundances of specific taxa in the  were significantly enriched for roles in the immune system, suggesting that changes in the  might influence immune gene expression systemically. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious inflammatory condition of the lung and is the most common complication associated with preterm birth. A large body of evidence now suggests that the gut  can influence immunity and inflammation systemically; however, the role of the gut  in BPD has not been evaluated to date. Here, we report that there are significant differences in the gut  of infants born at <29 weeks gestation and subsequently diagnosed with BPD, which are particularly pronounced when infants are stratified by birth mode. We also show that erythroid and immune gene expression levels are significantly altered in BPD infants. Interestingly, we identified an association between the composition of the  and immune gene expression in blood in early life. Together, these findings suggest that the composition of the  may influence the risk of developing BPD and, more generally, may shape systemic immune gene expression.Copyright © 2019 Ryan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587409>Transplant associated infections-The role of the gastrointestinal  and potential therapeutic options.</a></h1><p>Infectious complications are common following kidney transplantation and rank in the top five causes of death in patients with allograft function.

(Psa), is the most destructive disease in kiwifruit production. Therefore, prevent and control of the disease is a critical issue in kiwifruit industry worldwide. Unfortunately, there is no reliable control methods have been developed. Recently, interest in disease control using microbial agents is growing. However, kiwifruit  and their roles in the disease control is mainly remaining unknown. In this study, we secured bacterial libraries from kiwifruit ecospheres (rhizosphere, endospere, and phyllosphere) and screened reliable biocontrol strains against Psa. As the results,  W1SF4,  sp. W3SF9 and  KPB2 were selected as anti-Psa agents from the libraries. The strains showed forcible antibacterial activity as well as exceptional colonization ability on rhizosphere or phyllosphere of kiwifruit. Genome analyses of the strains suggested that the strains may produce several anti-Psa secondary metabolites. Our results will contribute to develop biocontrol strains against the kiwifruit canker pathogen and the disease management strategies.© The Korean Society of Plant Pathology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632550>Herbal Formula-3 ameliorates OVA-induced food allergy in mice may via modulating the gut .</a></h1><p>Formula-3 is a Chinese herbal medicine formula that was shown to inhibit food allergy in rats by stabilizing mast cells. But whether Formula-3 ameliorates food allergy through modulating the composition of intestinal  remains to be explored. Here, we aimed to determine whether gut  mediate the anti-food allergic effects of Formula-3. Mouse model of food allergy (FA) was induced by intragastrically administered with ovalbumin and cholera toxin for two weeks, then these mice were orally administrated daily with 1 ml PBS (0.1 mmol/L) or 1 ml Formula-3 (100 mg/m1) for four weeks. The number and abundance of gut mircrobiota were measured with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found administration of Formula-3 significantly alleviated FA by decreasing the serum levels of specific IgE, and Th2 cytokine IL-4, IL-, and IL-13. The dominant characteristics of gut  in mice with FA was the increase in  and decrease in , and the emergence of .

To improve differentiation, underlying pathogeneses need to be further unraveled.To determine if the microbial composition in the appendix differs between children with simple and complex appendicitis.Two-center, prospective cohort study including 40 children (0-17 years old) undergoing appendectomy for suspected appendicitis. Appendix tissue was used for IS-pro analysis to identify bacterial species by their length of 16S-23S rDNA interspacer (IS) region. Cluster analysis, based on IS-profiles, and correspondence with type of appendicitis, using Fisher exact test, was performed. Simple and complex appendicitis were compared regarding bacterial presence, intensity and diversity, using Fisher exact test and Mann-Whitney U test, respectively.Appendicitis was confirmed in 36 of 40 patients (16 simple, 20 complex). Cluster analysis identified 2 clusters, encompassing 34 patients. Distribution of simple and complex appendicitis was 12 (80%) and 3 (20%) versus 3 (16%) and 16 (84%) patients for clusters 1 and 2, respectively (P < 0.001). Complex appendicitis was on phylum level characterized by an increased intensity (Bacteroidetes P = 0.001, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria and Verrucomicrobia (FAFV) P = 0.005 and Proteobacteria P < 0.001) and diversity (Bacteroidetes P = 0.001 and Proteobacteria P = 0.016) and an increased abundance of  species (Alistipes finegoldii P = 0.009, Bacteroides fragilis P = 0.002, Escherichia coli P = 0.014, Parvimonas micra P = 0.022 and Sutterella spp P = 0.026).The microbial composition of the appendix differs between children with simple and complex appendicitis, regarding both composition and diversity.

However, it is unclear whether the gut  will change significantly when adding different proportions of ryegrass. In this study, 240 healthy male Yangzhou geese (28 days old) with similar body weights were randomly divided into four groups and fed different proportions grass (CK, whole commercial diets; EG1, ryegrass: commercial diets = 1.:1; EG2, ryegrass: commercial diets = 2:1; EG3, ryegrass: commercial diets = 3:1) respectively. When the geese grew to 70 days old, their intestines were collected and high-throughput sequencing technology was performed to investigate the microbial diversity in the caecum of geese with different dietary supplements. There was no obvious change in the alpha diversity of gut  of geese with ryegrass intake (P > 0.05) and the composition of dominant bacterium (including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) was also similar. However, the ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was remarkably reduced with ryegrass intake (P < 0.05), and the relative abundance of 30 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) significantly differed. Additionally, the content of cellulose-degrading  such as Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 were significantly increased in geese fed with increasing amounts of grass. Finally, the functional profiles of the goose gut  were explored using the PICRUSt tool. Carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism were dominant metabolic pathways. Lipid metabolism was significantly increased in EG3 compared that in the CK group (P < 0.05). Interestingly, Turicibacter and Parasutterella may have affected abdominal fat deposition as grass intake increased. Taken together, although the diversity of bacterial communities was similar in geese fed with different proportions of ryegrass, cellulose-degrading  (Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010) were abundant and the lipid metabolic pathway was enriched, which may reduce abdominal fat accumulation in high-ryegrass fed geese.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666699>Human gut bacteria contain acquired interbacterial defence systems.</a></h1><p>The human gastrointestinal tract consists of a dense and diverse microbial community, the composition of which is intimately linked to health. Extrinsic factors such as diet and host immunity are insufficient to explain the constituents of this community, and direct interactions between co-resident microorganisms have been implicated as important drivers of  composition. The genomes of bacteria derived from the gut  contain several pathways that mediate contact-dependent interbacterial antagonism. Many members of the Gram-negative order Bacteroidales encode the type VI secretion system (T6SS), which facilitates the delivery of toxic effector proteins into adjacent cells. Here we report the occurrence of acquired interbacterial defence (AID) gene clusters in Bacteroidales species that reside within the human gut . These clusters encode arrays of immunity genes that protect against T6SS-mediated intra- and inter-species bacterial antagonism. Moreover, the clusters reside on mobile elements, and we show that their transfer is sufficient to confer resistance to toxins in vitro and in gnotobiotic mice. Finally, we identify and validate the protective capability of a recombinase-associated AID subtype (rAID-1) that is present broadly in Bacteroidales genomes. These rAID-1 gene clusters have a structure suggestive of active gene acquisition and include predicted immunity factors of toxins derived from diverse organisms. Our data suggest that neutralization of contact-dependent interbacterial antagonism by AID systems helps to shape human gut  ecology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668878>Polyphasic characterization of two novel Lactobacillus spp. isolated from blown salami packages: Description of Lactobacillus halodurans sp. nov. and Lactobacillus salsicarnum sp. nov.</a></h1><p> analysis of blown pack spoiled salami revealed five distinguishable Lactobacillus isolates we could not assign to a known species. Two of the isolates (TMW 1.2172 and TMW 1.1920) are rod-shaped, whilst three isolates (TMW 1.2098, TMW 1.2118 and TMW 1.2188) appear coccus shaped or as short rods. All isolates are Gram-stain positive, facultative anaerobic, catalase and oxidase negative, non-motile and non-sporulating. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA, dnaK, pheS and rpoA gene sequences revealed two distinct lineages within the genus Lactobacillus (L.). The isolates are members of the Lactobacillus alimentarius group with Lactobacillus ginsenosidimutans DSM 24154 (99.4% 16S similarity), Lactobacillus versmoldensis DSM 14857 (97.9%) and Lactobacillus furfuricola DSM 27174 (97.7%) as phylogenetic closest related species and L. alimentarius DSM 20249 (97.7%) and Lactobacillus paralimentarius DSM 13961 (97.%) as closest relatives, respectively. Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values between the isolates and their close related type strains are lower than 80% and 25%, respectively. For both designated type strains, the peptidoglycan type is A4α l-Lys-d-Asp and the major fatty acids are C, C and summed feature 7. Based on phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic analysis we demonstrated that the investigated isolates belong to two novel Lactobacillus species for which we propose the names Lactobacillus salsicarnum with the type strain TMW 1.2098=DSM 109451=LMG 31401and Lactobacillus halodurans with the type strain TMW 1.2172=DSM 109452=LMG 31402.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

English-language randomized trials and observational studies were included to assess the direct health benefits and potential harms of screening for ASB. Randomized trials with control conditions of placebo or no treatment were included to evaluate the benefits and harms of ASB treatment, with observational studies also included for assessment of potential treatment harms among pregnant women. Included study populations were asymptomatic community-dwelling adults (ages 18+), not undergoing treatment or specialized care related to surgical or urologic procedures, including catheterization. Pregnant women of any age were also included and studied as a separate population. Due to the historical nature of the evidence, more lenient quality rating of studies was employed to allow for changes in trial reporting standards over time.We synthesized data on the benefits and harms of ASB screening and treatment for general adult populations separately from studies of pregnant women. Health outcomes and harms were sparsely and inconsistently reported in the studies conducted among general adult populations and in studies of screening conducted among pregnant women, precluding meta-analysis. For these outcomes, we described findings in the review text and tables and conducted narrative synthesis. Outcomes for the treatment of screen-detected ASB in pregnancy were analyzed with random effects meta-analysis to calculate the pooled differences when data were sufficient. We examined statistical heterogeneity among the pooled studies using standard χ2 tests and estimated the proportion of total variability in point estimates using the I statistic. We generated funnel plots and conducted the Egger tests for small-study effects for all pooled analyses that included at least 10 studies. Using established methods, we assessed the strength of evidence for each question.We included 19 studies of screening or treatment for ASB reported in 36 publications. Fourteen of the included studies were conducted among pregnant women; two of them examining the effectiveness and/or harms of screening (N=,289) and 12 examining the effectiveness and harms of treatment (N=2,377). Five included studies examined the effectiveness and harms of treatment among adult men and nonpregnant women (N=777), with most primarily focused on women. Reporting on the characteristics of study participants was sparse in the included literature, and all but one included were judged to be fair quality in risk of bias assessments.Of the two cohort studies on screening in pregnant women, one conducted in Spain (N=4,917) identified a three-fold reduction in risk for pyelonephritis in unadjusted comparisons on a retrospective unscreened and screened cohort. The other cohort study of screening in pregnant women was conducted in Turkey (N=372) and had low statistical power for comparisons of health outcomes in a screened and unscreened cohort due to rarity of outcome events. For health outcomes related to ASB screening in adult men/nonpregnant women, no eligible studies were identified for inclusion in the review.Twelve trials of ASB treatment among pregnant women (N=2,377) and five trials of ASB treatment among general adult populations (N=777) were included. Screening with culture testing was used in all but one recent included study. Antibiotic treatment was the most common intervention, but the treatment protocols varied considerably across studies. Data from 12 trials provided evidence that treatment of ASB in pregnancy reduces the risk of pyelonephritis (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.24 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.40], k=12, n=2,068, I2 56.9%). Seven treatment studies reported infant outcomes, demonstrating a reduction in low birthweight (<2500g or or small for gestational age [SGA; weight below the 10th percentile for gestation age]) (pooled RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.46 to 0.90], k=7, n=1,522, I2 15.8.6%). Data on potential harms and adverse effects of antibiotic treatment of ASB in pregnancy were sparsely reported in the trials, and power was low for observing rare outcomes. A pooled analysis from five studies reporting congenital malformations was null (pooled RR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.16 to 1.22], k=, n=961, I2 0%). Adverse reactions to medications were reported, including vaginitis, diarrhea, rashes, and nausea. Five trials (N=777) addressed the benefits of treating screen-detected ASB general adult populations, focused on women and older adults. Four trials were conducted only in women, and the fifth trial was primarily among older adult women (84%). Treatment was variable across the trials, ranging from a single dose to 3 months of daily antibiotics. Overall, no study found a difference in mortality, mobility, or rates of symptomatic infections between treated and untreated individuals. Data were inconsistently reported in the four studies reporting harms because they did not report any adverse events or identified few or no patients who withdrew from the study based on adverse events.This review was limited to English-language evidence, primarily from trials conducted in high and very high HDI countries. Risk of bias was judged to be high or difficult to assess due to limitations in reporting in many of the included studies. Most of the trials among pregnant women were conducted over 40 years ago, many using treatment protocols and scientific methods that are no longer commonly employed.In pregnancy, there is some evidence that treatment of urine culture screen-detected ASB confers a benefit to maternal and infant health, but most of the evidence is from an earlier era. We did not find evidence that treatment of ASB in nonpregnant populations is beneficial to health, based on a limited number of trials conducted mainly among older women. Information on harms was limited in the included studies, but established and emerging evidence highlights the importance of antibiotic stewardship to limit the development of antibiotic resistance and rising awareness of potential harms associated with antibiotic exposure, including changes to the  that increasingly are found to have consequences for health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573953>Health Disparities in Staphylococcus aureus Transmission and Carriage in a Border Region of the United States Based on Cultural Differences in Social Relationships: Protocol for a Survey Study.</a></h1><p>Health care-associated Staphylococcus aureus infections are declining but remain common. Conversely, rates of community-associated infections have not decreased because of the inadequacy of public health mechanisms to control transmission in a community setting. Our long-term goal is to use risk-based information from empirical socio-cultural-biological evidence of carriage and transmission to inform intervention strategies that reduce S aureus transmission in the community. Broad differences in social interactions because of cultural affiliation, travel, and residency patterns may impact S aureus carriage and transmission, either as risk or as protective factors.This study aims to (1) characterize S aureus carriage rates and compare circulating pathogen genotypes with those associated with disease isolated from local clinical specimens across resident groups and across Hispanic and non-Hispanic white ethnic groups and (2) evaluate social network relationships and social determinants of health-based risk factors for their impact on carriage and transmission of S aureus.We combine sociocultural survey approaches to population health sampling with S aureus carriage and pathogen genomic analysis to infer transmission patterns. Whole genome sequences of S aureus from community and clinical sampling will be phylogenetically compared to determine if strains that cause disease (clinical samples) are representative of community genotypes. Phylogenetic comparisons of strains collected from participants within social groups can indicate possible transmission within the group. We can therefore combine transmission data with social determinants of health variables (socioeconomic status, health history, etc) and social network variables (both egocentric and relational) to determine the extent to which social relationships are associated with S aureus transmission.We conducted a first year pilot test and feasibility test of survey and biological data collection and analytic procedures based on the original funded design for this project (#NIH U54MD012388). That design resulted in survey data collection from 336 groups and 1337 individuals. The protocol, described below, is a revision based on data assessment, new findings for statistical power analyses, and refined data monitoring procedures.This study is designed to evaluate ethnic-specific prevalence of S aureus carriage in a US border community. The study will also examine the extent to which kin and nonkin social relationships are concordant with carriage prevalence in social groups. Genetic analysis of S aureus strains will further distinguish putative transmission pathways across social relationship contexts and inform our understanding of the correspondence of S aureus reservoirs across clinical and community settings. Basic community-engaged nonprobabilistic sampling procedures provide a rigorous framework for completion of this -year study of the social and cultural parameters of S aureus carriage and transmission.©Talima Pearson, Steven D Barger, Monica Lininger, Heidi Wayment, Crystal Hepp, Francisco Villa, Kara Tucker-Morgan, Shari Kyman, Melissa Cabrera, Kevin Hurtado, Ashley Menard, Kelly Fulbright, Colin Wood, Mimi Mbegbu, Yesenia Zambrano, Annette Fletcher, Sarah Medina-Rodriguez, Mark Manone, Amanda Aguirre, Trudie Milner, Robert T Trotter II.

This trial studied CPSC effects on ruminal fermentation, biohydrogenation and the bacterial community in dairy cows. Ten cows were used in a crossover design with two experimental diets and fed during two 63-day periods. The cows were group fed forage ad libitum and the concentrate individually. The concentrates, control and CPSC, were isoenergetic, isoproteic and isofat. The ruminal samples collected at the end of each experimental period were analyzed for short-chain fatty acid, FA and DNA sequencing. CPSC decreased butyrate molar proportion (4%,  = 0.005). CPSC decreased C16:0 (28%,  < 0.001) and increased C18:0 (14%,  < 0.001) and total monounsaturated FA, especially C18:1 trans-11 (13%,  = 0.023). The total purine derivative excretion tended to be greater (%,  = 0.05) with CPSC, resulting in a 6% greater daily microbial N flow. CPSC did not affect the diversity indices but increased the relative abundances of  and , and decreased ,  and . In conclusion, the changes in ruminal fermentation and the FA profile were not associated with changes in microbial diversity or abundance of dominant populations, however, they might be associated with less abundant genera.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580203>Intra-operative recovery of preoperative vocal cord paralysis during hemithyroidectomy for benign thyroid disease: case report and review of the literature.</a></h1><p> Multinodular goiter associated with preoperative vocal cord palsy is usually indicative of invasive thyroid malignancy. However, benign thyroid disease may also lead to vocal cord paralysis.  We present a case of a 63-year old woman with a two-month history of hoarseness, loss of vocal pitch, difficulties with swallowing and shortness of breath. Preoperative flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy showed a left vocal cord paralysis. Left hemithyroidectomy with isthmectomy under intraoperative neuromonitoring for multinodular goiter was performed. Intra-operatively, both ipsilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) and vagal nerve (VN) were identified and preserved. Follow-up laryngoscopy  weeks postoperatively showed complete recovery of the left vocal cord movement.  Intuitively, surgeons may assume that preservation of a palsied RLN in patients with preexisting vocal cord paralysis is not meaningful. However, patients with RLN palsy associated with benign thyroid disease can experience full recovery after surgery.  Multinodular goiter associated with preoperative vocal cord paralysis should be managed with extreme caution and use of intra-operative neuromonitoring. The existing probability of intra-operative recovery of a preoperative RLN palsy underlines the importance of preserving the affected RLN during surgery for benign thyroid disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572320>How Management Practices Within a Poultry House During Successive Flock Rotations Change the Structure of the Soil .</a></h1><p>The  within a poultry production house influences the attainment of physiologically strong birds and thus food safety and public health. Yet little is known about the microbial communities within the house and the effects on the soil microbes onto which the houses are placed; nor the effects of management practices on their equilibrium. This study looked at the soil bacterial  before a broiler house was constructed, then through 11 flock rotations (2. years) that included a partial clean-out and a total clean-out within the management regimen. Major shifts were observed, occurring at the taxonomic class level, related to the introduction of bedding and birds on top of the soil. The partial clean-out of litter did not change the soil bacterial community in any substantial way, only prompting a temporary increase in some genera; however, the total litter clean-out caused a major increase in a cohort of Actinobacteria. The underlying soil contained bacteria beneficial for poultry metabolism, such as , , , and . Additionally, management practices affected the class structure of the soil bacterial community beneath the poultry house. The scheduling of these practices should be leveraged to exploit maintenance of beneficial bacteria that maximize  contributions to bird production processes, while minimizing possible antibiotic-resistant bacteria and environmental effects.Copyright © 2019 Crippen, Sheffield, Singh, Byrd and Beier.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31568152> and Body Composition During the Period of Complementary Feeding.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to explore the associations between food group intake, faecal  profile and body composition during the period of complementary feeding.Diet was assessed using a quantitative food frequency questionnaire, faecal  profile was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and body composition was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, in a cohort of 50 infants aged 6 to 24 months of age.During this critical period of  development, age was the strongest predictor of  composition with network analysis revealing a cluster of genera positively associated with age.

Bacteria of the family Alcaligenaceae, and more specifically of the genus Pigmentiphaga, have been found to be associated specifically to arboreal frogs. Here we analyze their occurrence in a previously assembled global skin  dataset from 205 amphibian species. Pigmentiphaga made up about % of the total number of reads in this global dataset. They were mostly found in unrelated arboreal frogs from Madagascar (Mantellidae and Hyperoliidae), but also occurred at low abundances on Neotropical frogs. Based on their 16S sequences, most of the sequences belong to a clade within Pigmentiphaga not assignable to any type strains of the five described species of the genus. One isolate from Madagascar clustered with Pigmentiphaga aceris (>99% sequence similarity on 16S rRNA gene level). Here, we report the full genome sequence of this bacterium which, based on 16S sequences of >97% similarity, has previously been found on human skin, floral nectar, tree sap, stream sediment and soil. Its genome consists of a single circular chromosome with 6,165,255 bp, ,300 predicted coding sequences, 57 tRNA genes, and three rRNA operons. In comparison with other known Pigmentiphaga genomes it encodes a higher number of genes associated with environmental information processing and cellular processes. Furthermore, it has a biosynthetic gene cluster for a nonribosomal peptide syntethase, and bacteriocin biosynthetic genes can be found, but clusters for β-lactones present in other comparative Pigmentiphaga genomes are lacking.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584892>Perineal Talc Use, Douching, and the Risk of Uterine Cancer.</a></h1><p>Perineal talc use and douching could affect the risk of uterine cancer through several possible pathways, including inflammation response,  changes, or endocrine disruption. Two previous cohort studies of the association between talc use and uterine cancer have reported weak positive associations, but we know of no previous evaluations of the relationship between douching and uterine cancer.Using a large prospective cohort, we examined the relationship between incident uterine cancer and self-reported use of talc or douche using Cox proportional hazards models.After excluding those with prior hysterectomy, 271 of 33,609 women reported incident uterine cancer (mean follow-up = 8.3 years in noncases; maximum 12.6 years). Overall, 26% of women reported ever using talc and 15% reported ever having douched. Ever talc use was associated with an increase in risk of uterine cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.94, 1.6), with some evidence of a dose-response for frequency of talc use (P-for-trend = 0.07). Ever douching was not associated with uterine cancer risk (HR = 1.0; 95% CI = 0.72, 1.), with no evidence of a frequency dose-response (P = 0.96). The estimates were similar when we restricted to invasive endometrial cancers, but not when we further restricted to endometroid adenocarcinomas.The positive association we observed between talc use and uterine cancer risk is consistent with findings from previous prospective cohort studies of endometrial cancer. The relationships between uterine cancer and both douching and talc use merit further consideration, particularly as both exposures are preventable.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600928>Prevalence of Resistance to β-Lactam Antibiotics and  Genes Among Commensal  Isolates from Respiratory  in Poland.</a></h1><p>(1) Background: Beta-lactams are the most frequently used antimicrobials, and are the first-line drugs in many infectious diseases, e.g., pneumonia, otitis media. Due to this fact, various bacteria have developed resistance to this group of drugs. (2) Methods: Eighty-seven  isolates were obtained from adults 18-70 years old in eastern Poland. The presence of 10  genes and 2 substitutions in  reported as the most frequent in  were analyzed. (3) Results: Among 57 beta-lactam-resistant isolates, 63.2% encoded  genes;  predominated (54.4%), followed by  (19.3%),  (12.3%),  (10.%),  (7.0%),  (.3%),  (1.8%) and  (1.8%). Lys-526 was the most common substitution in  gene. The resistance genotypes were as follows: gBLNAS (17.%), low-gBLNAR I (1.8%), low-gBLNAR II (1.8%), gBLNAR II (15.8%), gBLPAS (15.8%), gBLPAR (19.3%), gBLPBS I (8.8%) and gBLPBS II (1.8%); (4) Conclusions: This has been the first study to report on the high diversity of  genes in  isolates in Poland. High sensitivity and specificity of benzylpenicillin test, as well as PCR of  genes were shown, indicating that these methods may be useful as tools for the rapid screening of beta-lactamase prevalence and resistance to beta-lactams among  isolated from respiratory .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672979>ColPortal, an integrative multiomic platform for analysing epigenetic interactions in colorectal cancer.</a></h1><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Different pathological pathways and molecular drivers have been described and some of the associated markers are used to select effective anti-neoplastic therapy. More recent evidence points to a causal role of  and altered microRNA expression in CRC carcinogenesis, but their relationship with pathological drivers or molecular phenotypes is not clearly established. Joint analysis of clinical and omics data can help clarify such relations. We present ColPortal, a platform that integrates transcriptomic, microtranscriptomic, methylomic and  data of patients with colorectal cancer. ColPortal also includes detailed information of histological features and digital histological slides from the study cases, since histology is a morphological manifestation of a complex molecular change. The current cohort consists of Caucasian patients from Europe. For each patient, demographic information, location, histology, tumor staging, tissue prognostic factors, molecular biomarker status and clinical outcomes are integrated with omics data.

Numerous  studies have compared diets with divergent ingredients, but the everyday practice of cooking remains understudied. Here, we show that a plant diet served raw versus cooked reshapes the murine gut , with effects attributable to improvements in starch digestibility and degradation of plant-derived compounds. Shifts in the gut  modulated host energy status, applied across multiple starch-rich plants, and were detectable in humans. Thus, diet-driven host-microbial interactions depend on the food as well as its form.

The main transmission route is from toddlers, who commonly carry pneumococci. However, neonatal pneumococcal disease case reports suggest that vertical pneumococcal transmission may also occur.To describe and compare pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage and density by infant mode of delivery in young Fijian infants.Annual cross-sectional surveys were performed in Suva, Fiji, before the introduction of 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10), from September 14 to December 20, 2012, and after PCV10 was introduced, from July 11 to November 19, 2013; July 15 to December 9, 2014; and August 13 to November 19, 2015. Caregivers of 2006 infants aged  to 8 weeks participated in the surveys. Statistical analysis was performed from May 24, 2018, to August 12, 2019.Caregivers provided data on infant mode of delivery and demographics via interviewer-led survey.Pneumococci in swab samples were detected and quantified by lytA quantitative polymerase chain reaction with molecular serotyping by microarray. Pneumococci were categorized as PCV10 or non-PCV10 serotypes.Of the 2006 infants (976 girls and 1030 boys; mean [SD] age, 6.1 [0.02] weeks]), 1742 (86.8%) were born vaginally and 264 were born by cesarean delivery. Infants delivered vaginally, compared with those born by cesarean delivery, had a higher prevalence of overall pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage (470 of 1722 [27.3%; 95% CI, 25.2%-29.4%] vs 47 of 260 [18.1%; 95% CI, 13.6%-23.3%]; P = .002), PCV10 carriage (113 of 1698 [6.7%; 95% CI, .%-7.9%] vs 8 of 256 [3.1%; 95% CI, 1.4%-6.1%]; P = .03), and non-PCV10 carriage (355 of 1698 [20.9%; 95% CI, 19.0%-22.9%] vs 38 of 256 [14.8%; 95% CI, 10.7%-19.8%]; P = .02), and had higher median densities of overall pneumococci (4.9 log10 genome equivalents [GE]/mL [interquartile range, 4.8-.0 log10 GE/mL] vs 4. log10 GE/mL [interquartile range, 4.1-4.6 log10 GE/mL]; P = .01) and non-PCV10 pneumococci (4.9 log10 GE/mL [interquartile range, 4.7-.0 log10 GE/mL] vs 4.4 log10 GE/mL [interquartile range, 4.0-4.7 log10 GE/mL]; P = .01). Vaginal delivery was associated with overall (adjusted odds ratio, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.10-2.23]; P = .01) and non-PCV10 (adjusted odds ratio, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.01-2.20]; P = .04]) pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage. Vaginal delivery was not associated with PCV10 carriage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.67 [95% CI, 0.80-3.51]; P = .17). After adjustment, vaginal delivery was not associated with density.Pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage prevalence and density were higher in infants delivered vaginally compared with those delivered by cesarean birth. After adjustment, vaginal delivery was associated with pneumococcal carriage. Differences in carriage by mode of delivery may be due to differential exposure to the vaginal  during delivery and the effect of intrapartum antibiotics during cesarean delivery on the infant . Our findings also raise the hypothesis that vertical transmission may contribute to pneumococcal acquisition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622235> sp. nov., isolated from beef.</a></h1><p>Two  isolates derived independently from raw refrigerated processing meat of bovine origin intended for the manufacture of Bologna-type cooked sausage could be distinguished from other known species in subsequent phylogenetic analyses. Comparison of the complete B gene sequences in combination with nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed a separate branch within the   group. In further analyses, comprising phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characterization as well as average nucleotide identity (ANI) values obtained from the draft genome assemblies, the two isolates could be distinguished from all so far published closely related species. The closest relative was  DSM 3456 with ANI values of about 90.2 %.

Thereafter, dual-species  and  combination probiotics were routinely administered daily to high-risk neonates; from April 2016 triple-species probiotics (    and   subspecies ) were used.Incidence of NEC (modified Bell's stage 2a or greater), late-onset sepsis, and mortality.Rates of NEC fell from 7.% (35/469 neonates) in the pre-implementation epoch to 3.1% (16/513 neonates) in the routine probiotics epoch (adjusted sub-hazard ratio=0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.85, p=0.014). The more than halving of NEC rates after probiotics introduction was independent of any measured covariates, including breast milk feeding rates. Cases of late-onset sepsis fell from 106/469 (22.6%) to 59/513 (11.%) (p<0.0001), and there was no episode of sepsis due to  or . All-cause mortality also fell in the routine probiotics epoch, from 67/469 (14.3%) to 47/513 (9.2%), although this was not statistically significant after multivariable adjustment (adjusted sub-hazard ratio=0.74, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.12, p=0.155).Administration of multispecies  and  probiotics has been associated with a significantly decreased risk of NEC and late-onset sepsis in our neonatal unit, and no safety issues.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which TOE affects dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis remain unclear. After DSS-induced colitis were treated with different concentrations of TOE for 8 days, the bodyweight, disease activity index (DAI), colon lengths and pathological scoring were assessed, and histopathological examination was confirmed by HE staining. Furthermore, a transcriptome sequencing was performed by using the colon tissues between TOE and DSS groups, and the differentially expressed genes were conducted for the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and were validated by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis. In addition, a 16S rDNA sequencing was carried out to distinguish the differential gut  by using the mouse faecal samples between TOE and DSS groups. We found that TOE attenuated the clinical symptoms, lowered the inflammatory scoring and inhibited the secretion of proinflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in DSS-induced colitis. KEGG and GSEA analysis demonstrated that fatty acid degradation and cytokine-receptor signalling were predominantly enriched in TOE-treated colitis as compared with the DSS group. Further investigations revealed that TOE increased the expression levels of Adh5, Aldh3a2 and Acox3, but decreased those of CCL20, CCR6 and CXCL1/ in DSS-induced colitis, where TOE also induced the enrichment of S24-7 and adlercreutzia, but decreased the amount of anaerostipes, enterococcus, enterobacteriaceae and peptostreptococcaceae. In conclusion, TOE ameliorated DSS-induced colitis by regulating fatty acid degradation and microbial dysbiosis.© 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, the alteration of the intestinal  in order to achieve, restore, and maintain favorable balance in the ecosystem, and the activity of microorganisms present in the gastrointestinal tract is necessary for the improved health condition of the host. The objective of this translational study was to evaluate, in a pediatric population, the efficacy and safety of prophylactic probiotics for a better nutritional absorption capacity in the view to enhance their overall health and immunity.A total of 40 pediatric patients between the ages of 14 and 18 years were enrolled in the study and divided under two categories (treated/active group and placebo group). Three-time points clinical evaluations were performed: a baseline assessment (Time 0), a second evaluation at  weeks after the start of probiotic use (Time 1), and a final evaluation at the timeline after 10 weeks (Time 2). In the initial phase of the study, the recruited subjects underwent a panel of initial T0 clinical tests. For each of the patients, a blood sample was taken in order to evaluate the following biochemical measurements: Vitamin D, Vitamin A, Calcium, Zinc, and Iron. Moreover, an initial nutritional evaluation was carried out through which the nutritionist estimated the body composition of the subject (weight and body mass index), the caloric needs and dietary behaviour of each recruited patient.Eligible participants were randomized into placebo (n = 20) or treated/active (n = 20) treatment conditions by random allocation using a computerized random number generator, ensuring all investigators remained blind to the treatment distribution. The data were compared within and between groups using statistical methods. The results confirmed that the probiotic supplementation was effective in increasing the overall blood biomarkers levels of vitamins, calcium, and mineral absorption from baseline to 10 weeks of treatment, compared with the placebo.Probiotics may be suggested as supplements to improve biomarkers serum concentration if administered for a period of at least ≥  weeks.

The gut of children with optimum growth is enriched in certain species, especially  and  and ommensal  both contribute to formation of acidic stool, and an elevated faecal pH indicates reduction of these species in the gut. The purpose of the study was to investigate the association of faecal pH with childhood stunting.In this cross-sectional study, 100 children with length-for-age Z score (LAZ) <-1 aged between 12 and 18 months were enrolled from the ongoing Bangladesh Environmental Enteric Dysfunction study conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh. LAZ was measured by anthropometry and data on factors affecting linear growth were recorded. Faecal pH measurement was done using pH metre on freshly collected non-diarrhoeal faecal samples following standard procedure. Multiple quantile regression was done to quantify the relation between faecal pH and LAZ scores.The mean LAZ and faecal pH of the children were -2.12±0.80 and .84±1.11, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis showed a statistically significant negative correlation between stool pH and the LAZ scores (p<0.01). After inclusion of other factors affecting linear growth into the regression model, a statistically significant inverse association was observed between faecal pH and LAZ score (p<0.01).Elevated faecal pH was found to have a significant association with stunted growth.

The composition of the  in IF represents an important variable in the physiology and prognosis of this disease.We sought to compare the intestinal  and SCFA concentration of children who require parenteral nutrition (PN) with that of children with short-bowel syndrome (SBS) who have discontinued PN and with age-matched controls, using high-throughput sequencing to investigate host-microbe interactions.Fifty-three samples were submitted over 6-15 months. Six children with SBS + IF submitted 34 samples, and 6 children with SBS with discontinued PN submitted 15 samples; these were compared with samples from  control children. Fecal samples were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA partial gene sequencing using the MiSeq Illumina sequencer. SCFAs were measured in stool samples by mass spectrometry.Butyrate quantity was near absent in children with IF compared with that in controls (median 0.37 nmol/mg vs 10.92 nmol/mg; P < .0001). Similarly, commensal anaerobes known to produce SCFA, including Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, were reduced in those with SBS.

An obstacle to understanding this contradiction has been a shortage of in vivo models reproducing the unique structure and immunology of human skin. In this work, we developed a humanized model to study how healthy adult human skin responds to colonizing methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). We demonstrate the importance of the outer stratum corneum as the major site of bacterial colonization and how noninvasive MRSA adhesion to corneocytes induces a local inflammatory response in underlying skin layers. This signaling recruits neutrophils to the skin, where they control bacterial numbers, mediating transiency in colonization. This work highlights the spatiotemporal aspects of human skin colonization and demonstrates a subclinical inflammatory response to noninvasive MRSA that allows human skin to regulate the bacterial population at its outer surface.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Soil aggregates are supposed to provide heterogeneous habitats for microorganisms, which may result in distinct metabolic functions. However, limited information is available regarding the distribution patterns, driving factors, and activity of ureolytic  at the aggregate scale. In this study, we characterized the ureolytic  and urease activity of three soil aggregate fractions from an Inceptisol subjected to  years of different fertilization regimes. Correlations between soil chemical characteristics and ureolytic microbial communities were analyzed. The results showed that the total abundance as well as the relative abundance of copiotrophic ureolytic microbes generally increased with the increasing soil aggregate size. This trend was in line with the nutrient distribution patterns, including labile carbon, NH, total carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Soil urease activity also increased significantly with the increasing soil aggregate size and was positively correlated with copiotrophic ureolyric microbes, such as Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. Thus, we speculated that larger size soil aggregates with greater availability of labile carbon support more copiotrophic ureolyric microbes with a high growth rate, leading to a high density of total ureolytic microbes and higher urease activity. Smaller aggregates with less available carbon were associated with more oligotrophs, higher abundances of total ureolytic microbes, and higher urease activity. Our results suggest that larger soil aggregates and associated ureolyric microbes play a more important role in nutrient cycling for crop growth in this Inceptisol ecosystem.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643033>Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor Pyridostigmine Bromide Attenuates Gut Pathology and Bacterial Dysbiosis in a Murine Model of Ulcerative Colitis.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a Th2 inflammatory bowel disease characterized by increased IL- and IL-13 expression, eosinophilic/neutrophilic infiltration, decreased mucus production, impaired epithelial barrier, and bacterial dysbiosis of the colon. Acetylcholine and nicotine stimulate mucus production and suppress Th2 inflammation through nicotinic receptors in lungs but UC is rarely observed in smokers and the mechanism of the protection is unclear.In order to evaluate whether acetylcholine can ameliorate UC-associated pathologies, we employed a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC-like conditions, and a group of mice were treated with Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) to increase acetylcholine availability. The effects on colonic tissue morphology, Th2 inflammatory factors, MUC2 mucin, and gut  were analyzed.DSS challenge damaged the murine colonic architecture, reduced the MUC2 mucin and the tight-junction protein ZO-1. The PB treatment significantly attenuated these DSS-induced responses along with the eosinophilic infiltration and the pro-Th2 inflammatory factors. Moreover, PB inhibited the DSS-induced loss of commensal Clostridia and Flavobacteria, and the gain of pathogenic Erysipelotrichia and Fusobacteria.Together, these data suggest that in colons of a murine model, PB promotes MUC2 synthesis, suppresses Th2 inflammation and attenuates bacterial dysbiosis therefore, PB has a therapeutic potential in UC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628420>Changes in motor behavior, neuropathology, and gut  of a Batten disease mouse model following administration of acidified drinking water.</a></h1><p>CLN3 mutations cause the fatal neurodegenerative disorder, CLN3 Batten disease. The Cln3 mouse model displays characteristic features of the human disease including motor deficits. When mice received acidified drinking water (pH 2.-2.9) instead of normal tap water (pH 8.4) for several generations, the motor skills of Cln3 mice normalized to control levels, indicating a disease-modifying effect of acidified water. Here we investigated if acidified water administered from postnatal day 21 has therapeutic benefits in Cln3 mice. Indeed, acidified water temporarily attenuated the motor deficits, had beneficial effects on behavioral parameters and prevented microglial activation in the brain of Cln3 mice. Interestingly, in control mice, acidified drinking water caused brain region-specific glial activation and significant changes in motor performance. Since the gut  can influence neurological functions, we examined it in our disease model and found that the gut  of Cln3 mice was markedly different from control mice, and acidified water differentially changed the gut  composition in these mice. These results indicate that acidified water may provide therapeutic benefit to CLN3 Batten disease patients, and that the pH of drinking water is a major environmental factor that strongly influences the results of murine behavioral and pathological studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673418>Cartilage-gut- axis: a new paradigm for novel therapeutic opportunities in osteoarthritis.</a></h1><p>DNA of gut  can be found in synovium of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. This finding could result from the translocation of still alive bacteria from gut to joints through blood, since the diversified dormant  of healthy human blood can be transiently resuscitated in vitro. The recent finding of gut  in human cartilage, which differed between osteoarthritis and controls, suggests that a similar trafficking of dead or alive bacteria from gut  physiologically occurs between gut and epiphysial bone marrow. Subchondral  could enhance cartilage healing and transform components of deep cartilage matrix in metabolites with immunosuppressive properties. The differences of  observed between hip and knee cartilage, either in osteoarthritis or controls, might be the counterpart of subtle differences in chondrocyte metabolism, themselves in line with differences in DNA methylation according to joints. Although bacteria theoretically cannot reach chondrocytes from the surface of intact cartilage, some bacteria enter the vascular channels of the epiphysial growth cartilage in young animals, whereas others can infect chondrocytes in vitro. In osteoarthritis, the early osteochondral plate angiogenesis may further enhance the ability of  to locate close to the deeper layers of cartilage, and this might lead to focal dysbiosis, low-grade inflammation, cartilage degradation, epigenetic changes in chondrocytes and worsening of osteoarthritis. More studies on cartilage across different ethnic groups, weights, and according to age, are needed, to confirm the silent presence of gut  close to human cartilage and better understand its physiologic and pathogenic significance.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Iron fortificants adversely affect the infant gut , while co-provision of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) mitigates most of the adverse effects. Whether variations in maternal HMO profile can influence the infant response to iron and/or GOS fortificants is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine HMO profiles and the secretor/non-secretor phenotype of lactating Kenyan mothers and investigate their effects on the maternal and infant gut , and on the infant response to a fortification intervention with  mg iron (2. mg as sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate and 2. mg as ferrous fumarate) and 7. g GOS. We studied mother-infant pairs ( = 80) participating in a 4-month intervention trial in which the infants (aged 6.-9. months) received daily a micronutrient powder without iron, with iron or with iron and GOS. We assessed: (1) maternal secretor status and HMO composition; (2) effects of secretor status on the maternal and infant gut  in a cross-sectional analysis at baseline of the intervention trial; and (3) interactions between secretor status and intervention groups during the intervention trial on the infant gut , gut inflammation, iron status, growth and infectious morbidity. Secretor prevalence was 72% and HMOs differed between secretors and non-secretors and over time of lactation. Secretor status did not predict the baseline composition of the maternal and infant gut .

TSG has protective effects on the liver, reduces cholesterol and possesses anti-oxidant, anti-tumor, and anti-atherosclerotic properties. However, the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of action of Polygonum multiflorum on atherosclerosis (AS) have not been studied yet.The aim of this research was to study the effects of Polygoni Multiflori Radix Praeparata (PMRP) and its major active chemical constituent TSG on AS in ApoE-deficient (ApoE) mice fed with high fat diets to provide a scientific basis in the use of PMRP and TSG against cardiovascular diseases.High fat diet induced AS in ApoE mice were treated with PMRP, TSG (low and high doses), and simvastatin (SIM) for 8 weeks. At the end of the treatment, mouse serum lipid levels, triglycerides (TG), and total cholesterol (TC) were measured by an oxidase method (other indicators were determined by ELISA), while the content in oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and the expression of inflammatory factors such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in the serum and aortic samples were measured by ELISA. Atherosclerotic plaque morphology was evaluated by oil red O in thoracic aorta. In addition, 16S rDNA-V4 hypervariable region genome sequence of all microbes in the fecal sample from each group was analyzed to evaluate potential structure changes in the gut  after treatment with PMRP and TSG.TSG markedly inhibited AS plaque formation in ApoE mice. Furthermore, PMRP and TSG improved lipid accumulation by reducing TG and ox-LDL levels. TSG inhibited inflammation by the down-regulation of IL-6, TNF-α, VCAM-1 and MCP-1 expression in serum, and PMRP inhibited inflammation by reducing VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and CCRA expression in aortic tissue. In addition, TSG reduced or prevented AS by the regulation of the composition of the overall gut , such as Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Tenericutes, Proteobacteria phyla, Akkermensia genera and Helicobacter pylori.PMRP and TSG improved lipid accumulation and inflammation, and regulated the intestinal microbial imbalance in ApoE mice. TSG exerted a preventive effect in the development and progression of AS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Statistical analyses focused on intraindividual and interindividual bacterial diversity and identification of differentially abundant taxa.Patients with NMDAR encephalitis and controls had similar  profiles of the gut  regarding intraindividual bacterial diversity, OTU distribution, ratio between regional and local species diversity when testing all OTUs, and genera with a relative abundance greater than 0.%. Similarly, the subgroup of NMDAR encephalitis patients with an ovarian teratoma (n = 3) showed no differences in  variation compared with controls. Patients in the acute encephalitis stage (n = 8) showed significant differences in the numbers of , , , , and ; however, significance was lost after correction for multiple testing.Patients with NMDAR encephalitis and controls both had a normal gut . The lack of overabundance of certain bacterial species in patients suggests that  changes are no major contributors to the pathogenesis, disease course, or prognosis in NMDAR encephalitis.

Microbial communities of each fecal sample were characterized using Illumina sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Dietary recalls were analyzed using the Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Recall Dietary Assessment Tool.Associations between dietary factors and  features were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman rank correlations, or permutational multivariate analysis of variance. For demographic and health-related variables, χ analyses were used to test for differences between age groups for categorical variables.Our results show that age is correlated with three metrics of  diversity (P<0.05) and is associated with both community structure (P=0.0488) and membership (P=0.0002). Several dietary food groups and nutrients were likewise associated with  features. For example, consumption of non-whole-grain foods was associated with community structure (P=0.0089) and membership (P=0.0057), but not diversity (P>0.05). Likewise, the relative abundance of several bacterial taxa were linked to consumption of particular food groups and/or nutrients, as illustrated by the positive associations between total fruit (P<0.05) and fiber (P<0.05) consumption with the relative abundance of the Lachnospira genera.This hypothesis-generating study demonstrates that the composition of the child gut  remains dynamic beyond the age of 3 years and responds to dietary differences across individuals. In particular, non-whole-grain foods fortified with vitamins and minerals appear to be associated with the composition of the . Future interventional or model organism-based studies will be needed to test these associations between diet and  composition.Copyright © 2019 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

This may result from altered energy metabolism or dietary habits.We hypothesized that a lower intake of BCAAs improves tissue-specific insulin sensitivity.This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial examined well-controlled T2D patients receiving isocaloric diets (protein: 1 g/kg body weight) for 4 wk. Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake. The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess insulin signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001). Under clamp conditions, whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity did not differ between diets. After the BCAA- diet, however, the oral glucose sensitivity index was 24% (P < 0.01) and circulating fibroblast-growth factor 21 was 21% higher (P < 0.05), whereas meal-derived insulin secretion was 28% lower (P < 0.05).

Furthermore, alterations in the feline ocular surface  over time or following topical antibiotic treatment are unknown. Aims of this study were to further characterize the ocular surface  of healthy cats and to identify whether there are microbial community changes over time and following topical antibiotic use. Twenty-four eyes from twelve adult, research-bred, female spayed domestic shorthaired cats were evaluated. Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment (0.%) was applied to the ocular surface of one randomly assigned eye per cat three times daily for 7 days, while the fellow eye served as an untreated control. The ocular surface was sampled by swabbing the inferior conjunctival fornix of both eyes prior to initiating treatment (day 0), after 1 week of treatment (day 7), and 4 weeks after concluding treatment (day 35). Genomic DNA was extracted from the swabs and sequenced using primers that target the V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. At baseline, the most common bacterial phyla identified were Proteobacteria (42.4%), Firmicutes (30.0%), Actinobacteria (15.6%), and Bacteroidetes (8.1%). The most abundant bacterial families sequenced were Corynebacteriaceae (7.8%), Helicobacteraceae (7.%), Moraxellaceae (6.1%), and Comamonadaceae (.6%). Alpha and beta diversity measurements were largely unchanged in both treatment and control eyes over time.

Recent reports support association of airborne-pollen with seasonal exacerbation of depression (mood seasonality) and timing of suicidal behavior. Therefore, we hypothesized that Old Order Amish (OOA) with summer/spring pattern of seasonality (abbreviated as summer pattern) and S-SAD will have significant mood worsening on high pollen days.A seasonal pattern of mood worsening and SAD parameters were estimated using Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ).

Participants were randomized to immediate or delayed (post-4-week washout) intervention groups. During the 4-week intervention period, participants were given frozen GLVs and counseled to consume one cooked cup equivalent daily. The primary outcomes were: accrual-recruiting 50 adults in 9 months; retention-retaining 80% of participants at completion; and adherence-meeting GLV intake goals on 90% of days. Adherence data were collected twice weekly and 24-h dietary recalls at each time point provided nutrient and food group measures. The Food Acceptability Questionnaire (FAQ) was completed to determine acceptability. On each of the four study visits, anthropometrics, stool, saliva, and blood were obtained.

Gut  exerts a fundamental role on host physiology, and how extrinsic perturbations influence its composition has been increasingly examined. However, the effect of DBPs on gut  is still poorly understood.

Novel alternatives to traditional antibiotics, such as peptidomimetics, have the potential to address this challenge. Previously, two series of cationic amphiphiles (CAms) were developed with both hydrophilic head groups and nonpolar domains, giving them the ability to self-assemble into supramolecular nanostructures with membrane-lytic properties. Those CAms were shown to be effective against biofilms of Gardnerella vaginalis while preserving the commensal . Two new series of CAms were designed with varying levels of flexibility between the hydrophilic head groups and the hydrophobic domains. Activities against the vaginal pathogen G. vaginalis ranged from 1.3 µM to 18. µM, while the tested vaginal lactobacilli were significantly more tolerant of CAms, with MIC values as high as 208 µM. Minimal biofilm bactericidal concentrations (MBC-Bs) of the tested CAms ranged from 21.47 µM to < 388.3 µM, and were lowest against resistant forms of G. vaginalis, while Lactobacillus biofilms were tolerant of concentrations ≥ 687 µM. Safety aspects of the CAms were also investigated, and they were found to be safe for use against vaginal ectocervical tissue.© FEMS 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660061>Variation in the microbial community contributes to the improvement of the main active compounds of  Rehd. et Wils in the process of sweating.</a></h1><p> Rehd. et Wils, commonly called Houpo, has been used for thousands of years in China as a traditional herbal medicine. The primary processing of Houpo requires sweating treatment, which is a special drying process and is considered to be an essential embodiment of high quality and genuine medicinal materials. The sweating of Houpo leads to peculiar changes in the microbial community structure and the content of main active substances (magnolol, honokiol, syringin and magnoflorine). Variation in the microbial community was considered the cause of the change in content of active substances of Houpo, although the microbial taxa responsible for the improvement of content remain unidentified.In this study, we used MiSeq high-throughput sequencing methods for partial bacterial 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene sequences to compare the bacterial and fungal community structures at different timepoints in the process of sweating. The content of the main active substances (magnolol, honokiol, syringin and magnoflorine) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis to evaluate the effects of sweating. UPLC-Q-Extractive Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UPLC-QE Orbitrap MS) was used to detection of differential metabolites of unsweated Houpo before and after co-culture with core bacterial solutions.In this study, the total contents of magnolol (MG) and honokiol (HK) were significantly increased at 4 dp (dp for day PM sample), up to 3.75%, and the contents of syringin (SG) and magnoflorine (MF) were as high as 0.12% and 0.06%, respectively. Bacterial abundance and diversity were higher in the early stage (0 day-2 da; da for day AM sample) than in the later stage (4- dp), while fungal abundance was more obvious in the later stage than in the early stage. Positive correlation coefficients revealed that the relative abundance of  (P < 0.05),  (P < 0.05),  (P < 0.05),  (P < 0.05) and  (P < 0.05) would be conducive to improving the quality of Houpo. Negative correlation coefficients revealed that the relative abundance of , , , , , , , ,  and  could be a potential antagonist for the decrease in the quality of Houpo. After co-culture of single core strain and unsweated Houpo, there was no significant difference in the four main active components, but there were other metabolites with significant difference.Our findings reveal that sweating increased the content of the main active compounds, promoted the relative abundance of potentially beneficial microbes, decreased the abundance of potentially harmful microbes, the core functional genera group together, forming a core , these genera are dominant across the different stages of the sweating process and contribute to the quality development of the characteristics of Houpo.

We determined whether measuring specific compounds in vaginal fluid might be a simple, noninvasive, and cost-effective way to predict the bacteria that dominate the vaginal  and indicate the presence of a shortened cervix (<25 mm). Vaginal fluid samples were prospectively collected from mid-trimester pregnant women, and the concentrations of d- and l-lactic acid, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-8, the 70-kDa heat shock protein, a2 isoform of vacuolar ATPase, and sequestrome-1 were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The compositions of vaginal microbiomes were assessed by analysis of the V1-V3 regions of 16S rRNA genes, while cervical length was determined by transvaginal ultrasonography. The vaginal microbiomes could be clustered into five community state types (CSTs), four of which were dominated by a single  species. The dominance of  or  in the vaginal  predicted the level of d-lactic acid present. Several of the biomarkers, especially TIMP-1, in combination with the subject's age and race, were significantly associated with cervical length. Using piecewise structural equation modeling, we established a causal network that links CST to cervical length via biomarkers. We concluded that measuring levels of TIMP-1 and d-lactic acid in vaginal secretions might be a straightforward way to assess the risk for preterm birth due to a short cervix and  composition. Premature birth and its complications are the largest contributors to infant death in the United States and globally. A short cervical length and the depletion of  species are known risk factors for preterm birth. However, in many resource-poor areas of the world, the technology to test for their occurrence is unavailable, and pregnant women with these risk factors are neither identified nor treated. In this study, we used path analysis to gain an unprecedented understanding of interactions between vaginal  composition, the concentrations of various compounds in vaginal secretions, and cervical length. We identified low-cost point-of-care measures that might be used to identify pregnant women at risk for preterm birth. The use of these measures coupled with appropriate preventative or treatment strategies could reduce the incidence of preterm births in poor areas of the world that lack access to more sophisticated diagnostic methods.Copyright © 2019 Witkin et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624757>Hair regrowth following fecal  transplantation in an elderly patient with alopecia areata: A case report and review of the literature.</a></h1><p>Alopecia areata is a hair loss disease associated with genetics, autoimmunity, and other factors. There is an intriguing link between alopecia areata and gut dysbiosis. Fecal  transplantation (FMT) has been recommended to treat  (previously known as ) infection, and has also shown potentials in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and non-alcohol fatty liver disease.An 86-year-old man, with a history of sigmoid colon carcinoma, suffered from recurrent abdominal pain and distension, and diarrhea for six months, with inappetence. At admission, he was also diagnosed with depression. Upon physical examination, the patient presented with a 1. cm × 2.0 cm alopecia areata on his right occiput. Due to the negative results of laboratory testing, capsule endoscopy, and colonoscopy, the patient was diagnosed with noninfectious diarrhea, depressive disorder, and patchy alopecia areata. Considering that noninfectious diarrhea in the elderly patient was mainly caused by gut dysbiosis, he was given six rounds of FMT. His diarrhea improved remarkably one month after FMT, with improved appetite and disappearance of abdominal pain, distension, and depressive symptoms. Surprisingly, he reported new hair growth on the affected region of his scalp, with some of his white hair gradually turning to black, without taking any other therapies for alopecia areata before and after FMT.FMT might act as a potential therapy for patients who suffer from alopecia areata.

Serum samples were assayed by ELISA for LPS, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL6) and endothelin-1. A total of four gut Gram-negative phyla (Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria and Verrucomicrobia) were identified in the gut  of the T2DM-CKD and control groups. Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria exhibited significantly increased relative abundance in patients with T2DM-CKD when compared with controls (P<0.05). The levels of serum LPS were significantly increased in patients with T2DM-CKD compared with controls (P<0.05). Elevated serum LPS was significantly correlated with increased levels of TNFα, IL6 and CRP.

However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different  is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different fat-to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the  and early-stage metabolic syndrome. The two diets resulted in different  but similar diabetic states. Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic acid, cholestan-3-ol (β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with lipogenesis and inflammation. Our study suggests that different metabolic-syndrome-inducing diets may result in different  but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Various types of diet can lead to type 2 diabetes. The gut  in type 2 diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut  induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease.

They impact plant-pathogen interactions and may influence plant reproduction. Past studies have shown differences in composition and structure of the leaf, flower, and host , but an investigation of the impact of individual taxa on these variations remains to be tested. Such information will help to evaluate disparities and to better understand the biology and evolution of the plant-microbe associations. In the present study, we investigated the community structure, occupancy of host and organ, and the prevalence of phyllosphere bacteria from three host species collected at the same location. Almost all (98%) of bacterial taxa detected in the phyllosphere were not only shared across leaves and flowers, or different plant species but also had a conserved prevalence across sub-environments of the phyllosphere. We also found nonrandom associations of the phylogenetic diversity of phyllosphere bacteria. These results suggest that the phyllosphere  is more conserved than previously acknowledged, and dominated by generalist bacteria adapted to environmental heterogeneity through evolutionary conserved traits.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634382>Diet modulates cecum bacterial diversity and physiological phenotypes across the BXD mouse genetic reference population.</a></h1><p>The BXD family has become one of the preeminent genetic reference populations to understand the genetic and environmental control of phenotypic variation. Here we evaluate the responses to different levels of fat in the diet using both chow diet (CD, 13-18% fat) and a high-fat diet (HFD, 45-60% fat). We studied cohorts of BXD strains, both inbred parents C57BL/6J and DBA/2J (commonly known as B6 and D2, respectively), as well as B6D2 and D2B6 reciprocal F1 hybrids. The comparative impact of genetic and dietary factors was analyzed by profiling a range of phenotypes, most prominently their cecum bacterial composition. The parents of the BXDs and F1 hybrids express limited differences in terms of weight and body fat gain on CD. In contrast, the strain differences on HFD are substantial for percent body fat, with DBA/2J accumulating 12.% more fat than C57BL/6J (P < 0.0001). The F1 hybrids born to DBA/2J dams (D2B6F1) have 10.6% more body fat (P < 0.001) than those born to C57BL/6J dams. Sequence analysis of the cecum  reveals important differences in bacterial composition among BXD family members with a substantial shift in composition caused by HFD. Relative to CD, the HFD induces a decline in diversity at the phylum level with a substantial increase in Firmicutes (+13.8%) and a reduction in Actinobacteria (-7.9%). In the majority of BXD strains, the HFD also increases cecal sIgA (P < 0.0001)-an important component of the adaptive immunity response against microbial pathogens. Host genetics modulates variation in cecum bacterial composition at the genus level in CD, with significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Oscillibacter mapped to Chr 3 (18.7-19.2 Mb, LRS = 21.4) and for Bifidobacterium mapped to Chr 6 (89.21-89.37 Mb, LRS = 19.4). Introduction of HFD served as an environmental suppressor of these QTLs due to a reduction in the contribution of both genera (P < 0.001). Relations among liver metabolites and cecum bacterial composition were predominant in CD cohort, but these correlations do not persist following the shift to HFD. Overall, these findings demonstrate the important impact of environmental/dietary manipulation on the relationships between host genetics, gastrointestinal bacterial composition, immunological parameters, and metabolites-knowledge that will help in the understanding of the causal sources of metabolic disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618654>Transcriptional Atlas of Intestinal Immune Cells Reveals that Neuropeptide α-CGRP Modulates Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cell Responses.</a></h1><p>Signaling abnormalities in immune responses in the small intestine can trigger chronic type 2 inflammation involving interaction of multiple immune cell types. To systematically characterize this response, we analyzed 58,067 immune cells from the mouse small intestine by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) at steady state and after induction of a type 2 inflammatory reaction to ovalbumin (OVA). Computational analysis revealed broad shifts in both cell-type composition and cell programs in response to the inflammation, especially in group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). Inflammation induced the expression of exon  of Calca, which encodes the alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide (α-CGRP), in intestinal KLRG1 ILC2s. α-CGRP antagonized KLRG1 ILC2s proliferation but promoted IL- expression. Genetic perturbation of α-CGRP increased the proportion of intestinal KLRG1 ILC2s. Our work highlights a model where α-CGRP-mediated neuronal signaling is critical for suppressing ILC2 expansion and maintaining homeostasis of the type 2 immune machinery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Low-dose antibiotics have historically been used to modulate food production animals and their . Identifying alternatives to antibiotics conferring similar modulatory properties has been elusive. The purpose of this study was to determine if a host-tailored probiotic could recapitulate effects of a low-dose antibiotic on host response and the developing . Over 13 days of life, turkey poults were supplemented continuously with a low-dose antibiotic or oral supplementation of a prebiotic with or without two different probiotics (8 cage units,  = 80 per group). Gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal communities of poults were characterized by 16S rRNA gene and ITS2 amplicon sequencing. Localized and systemic host gene expression was assessed using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), kinase activity was assessed by avian-specific kinome peptide arrays, and performance parameters were assessed. We found that development of the early-life  of turkey poults was tightly ordered in a tissue- and time-specific manner. Low-dose antibiotic and turkey-tailored probiotic supplementation, but not nontailored probiotic supplementation, elicited similar shifts in overall  composition during development compared to controls. Treatment-induced bacterial changes were accompanied by parallel shifts in the fungal community and host gene expression and enhanced performance metrics. These results were validated in pen trials that identified further additive effects of the turkey-tailored probiotic combined with different prebiotics. Alternative approaches to low-dose antibiotic use in poultry are feasible and can be optimized utilizing the indigenous poultry . Similar approaches may also be beneficial for humans. Alternative approaches are greatly needed to reduce the need for antibiotic use in food animal production. This study utilized a pipeline for the development of a host-tailored probiotic to enhance performance in commercial turkeys and modulate their , similar to the effects of low-dose antibiotic administration. We determined that a host-tailored probiotic, developed in the context of the commercial turkey gut , was more effective at modulating these parameters than a nontailored probiotic cocktail. Furthermore, the host-tailored probiotic mimicked many of the effects of a low-dose antibiotic growth promoter. Surprisingly, the effects of the antibiotic growth promoter and host-tailored probiotic were observed across kingdoms, illustrating the coordinated interkingdom effects of these approaches.

The present study investigated changes in the gut  related to pollutant exposure using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). DNA was extracted from fecal samples. Amplicon Generation and the quality control of PCR products were performed. PCR products was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Data analysis included: operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering and species annotation, alpha diversity, beta diversity, principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), and the use of PICRUSt bioinformatics software. The microbial diversity of the SHR rats was inversely associated with exposure to pollutants. In terms of relative abundance, 24 bacterial genera and 2 genera in particular ( and ) significantly declined, and one genus () increased. Moreover, pollutant exposure was associated with the accumulation of genes from the gut  that are implicated in cardiovascular diseases.

Using Listeria phage PSA, we present a synthetic biology blueprint for host-range engineering through targeted modification of serovar-specific receptor binding proteins (RBPs). We identify Gp15 as the PSA RBP and construct a synthetic phage library featuring sequence-randomized RBPs, from which host range mutants are isolated and subsequently integrated into a synthetic, polyvalent phage with extended host range. To enable rational design of chimeric RBPs, we determine the crystal structure of the Gp15 receptor-binding carboxyl terminus at 1.7-Å resolution and employ bioinformatics to identify compatible, prophage-encoded RBPs targeting different Listeria serovars. Structure-guided design enables exchange of heterologous RBP head, neck, or shoulder domains to generate chimeric phages with predictable and extended host ranges. These strategies will facilitate the development of phage biologics based on standardized virus scaffolds with tunable host specificities.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Antibiotics represent the mainstay of treatment, suggesting a crucial role of dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of this condition. Anti-tumor necrosis factor agents have been shown to adversely impact the gut  and local host immunity.The aim of this study is to assess the effect of prior exposure to biologics on the development of pouchitis in patients who have ulcerative colitis.This is a retrospective case-control study.This study was conducted at a tertiary-care IBD center.Consecutive patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent restorative proctocolectomy between 2000 and 2010 were included.The primary outcome measured was the incidence of pouchitis.Four hundred seventeen patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent IPAA were included. The incidence of pouchitis was 40.4%. There were no differences in patient demographics, disease-specific factors, surgical approach, and short-term postoperative complications between patients who developed pouchitis compared to those that did not. Patients exposed to anti-tumor necrosis factor agents or preoperative steroids were significantly more likely to develop pouchitis (anti-tumor necrosis factor: 47.9% vs 36.%, p = 0.027; steroids: 41.7% vs 23.3%, p = 0.048). However, on multivariable analysis, only anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy was an independent predictor for pouchitis (p = 0.05). Pouchitis was not associated with adverse long-term outcomes.The retrospective design was a limitation of this study.In a large cohort of patients undergoing IPAA for ulcerative colitis with at least a -year follow-up, anti-tumor necrosis factor exposure was the only independent risk factor for the development of pouchitis.

Stressful life events can impact gut-brain signalling, leading to altered mood, cognition and intestinal dysfunction. Here we identify nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (Nod)-like receptors (NLR), Nod1 and Nod2, as novel regulators for gut-brain signalling. NLR are innate immune pattern recognition receptors expressed in the gut and brain, important in the regulation of gastrointestinal (GI) physiology. We found that mice deficient in both Nod1 and Nod2 (NodDKO) demonstrate signs of stress-induced anxiety, cognitive impairment and depression in the context of a hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. These deficits were coupled with impairments in the serotonergic pathway in the brain, decreased hippocampal cell proliferation and immature neurons, as well as reduced neural activation. In addition, NodDKO mice had increased GI permeability and altered serotonin signalling in the gut following exposure to acute stress. Administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, abrogated behavioral impairments and restored serotonin signalling. We also identified that intestinal epithelial cell-specific deletion of Nod1 (VilCre Nod1 ), but not Nod2, increased susceptibility to stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour and cognitive impairment following exposure to stress. Together these data suggest that intestinal epithelial NLR are novel modulators of gut-brain communication and may serve as potential novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of gut-brain disorders.

Here, we report the results of the metagenomic analysis of two mud/water pools that greatly differ in both temperature and pH (T = 85 °C and pH .; T = 92 °C and pH 1., for Pool1 and Pool2, respectively). DNA deep sequencing and following in silico analysis led to 14 934 and 17 652 complete ORFs in Pool1 and Pool2, respectively. They exclusively belonged to archaeal cells and viruses with great genera variance within the phylum Crenarchaeota, which reflected the difference in temperature and pH of the two Pools. Surprisingly, 30% and 62% of all of the reads obtained from Pool1 and 2, respectively, had no match in nucleotide databanks. Genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism were 15% and 16% of the total in the two Pools, with 278 and 308 putative CAZymes in Pool1 and 2, corresponding to ~ 2.0% of all ORFs. Biochemical characterization of two CAZymes of a previously unknown archaeon revealed a novel subfamily GH5_19 β-mannanase/β-1,3-glucanase whose hemicellulose specificity correlates with the vegetation surrounding the sampling site, and a novel NAD -dependent GH109 with a previously unreported β-N-acetylglucosaminide/β-glucoside specificity. DATABASES: The sequencing reads are available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database under the accession numbers SRR7545549 (Pool1) and SRR7545550 (Pool2). The sequences of GH5_Pool2 and GH109_Pool2 are available in GenBank database under the accession numbers MK869723 and MK86972, respectively. The environmental data relative to Pool1 and Pool2 (NCBI BioProject PRJNA481947) are available in the Biosamples database under the accession numbers SAMN09692669 (Pool1) and SAMN09692670 (Pool2).© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579822>Ruminococcin C, a promising antibiotic produced by a human gut symbiont.</a></h1><p>A major public health challenge today is the resurgence of microbial infections caused by multidrug-resistant strains. Consequently, novel antimicrobial molecules are actively sought for development. In this context, the human gut  is an under-explored potential trove of valuable natural molecules, such as the ribosomally-synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). The biological activity of the sactipeptide subclass of RiPPs remains under-characterized. Here, we characterize an antimicrobial sactipeptide, Ruminococcin C1, purified from the caecal contents of rats mono-associated with  E1, a human symbiont. Its heterologous expression and post-translational maturation involving a specific sactisynthase establish a thioether network, which creates a double-hairpin folding. This original structure confers activity against pathogenic  and multidrug-resistant strains but no toxicity towards eukaryotic cells. Therefore, the Ruminococcin C1 should be considered as a valuable candidate for drug development and its producer strain  E1 as a relevant probiotic for gut health enhancement.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

However, little is known about the impact of breed on the fecal  composition in dogs. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the differences in the fecal  in three breeds of dog fed and housed under the same conditions, namely eight Maltese (8.0 ± 0.1 years), eight Miniature Schnauzer (8.0 ± 0.0 years), and nine Poodle dogs (8.0 ± 0.0 years). Fresh fecal samples were collected from the dogs and used to extract metagenomic DNA. The composition of the fecal  was evaluated by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing on the MiSeq platform. A total of 840,501 sequences were obtained from the 25 fecal samples and classified as Firmicutes (32.3-97.3% of the total sequences), Bacteroidetes (0.1-62.6%), Actinobacteria (0.2-14.7%), Fusobacteria (0.0-.7%), and Proteobacteria (0.0-.1%). The relative abundance of Firmicutes was significantly lower in the Maltese dog breed than that in the other two breeds, while that of Fusobacteria was significantly higher in the Maltese than in the Miniature Schnauzer breed. At the genus level, the relative abundance of , , , , and  differed significantly among the three dog breeds. These genera had no correlation with age, diet, sex, body weight, vaccination history, or parasite protection history. Within a breed, some of these genera had a correlation with at least one blood chemistry value.

Particularly, root exudation is one of the most important plant-associated processes in this respect, as it may have a substantial effect on the bioavailability of soil contaminants, specially of hydrophobic contaminants strongly sorbed by soil. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of root exudates (natural and artificial) on the desorption of α-, β-, δ- and γ-isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) from contaminated soil, using batch experiments. Natural root exudates were obtained from Holcus lanatus plants growing in the same (contaminated) area. Fifteen compounds (mainly organic acids and phenolic compounds) usually found in root exudates were also tested, individually or as mixtures (1 and 10 mM). Both natural and artificial exudates favoured the mobilization of sorbed HCH in soil. The effect was highly significant for α-, β- and γ-HCH isomers, for which the desorption rates increased by 23.0, 26.8 and 15.% in the presence of natural root exudates and by 40.1, 25.9 and 25.6% in the presence of the artificial mixture (at 10 mM). The δ-HCH desorption rates increased by less than 10%. The effect of individual exudate components was very variable, but increased with the carbon content, reflecting the significance of hydrophobic interactions between the exudates and HCH molecules in the desorption of these last from soil. These findings indicate that plants may significantly influence the bioavailability of persistent contaminants, with major implications for improving phyto- and bioremediation procedures.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Nile tilapia,  fingerlings (40 g) were randomly stocked at 50 fish m in 1.25 m cages in low input ponds. The fish were fed on diets supplemented with either  (1 × 10 CFU g) or  (1 × 10 CFU g) at six levels: Diet 0 (No probiotic);  at 2 g kg (Diet 1); 4 g kg (Diet 2) and 6 g kg (Diet 3) and  at  g kg (Diet 4); 10 g kg (Diet ) and 15 g kg (Diet 6) for 180 days. Results indicate that hemato-immunological parameters (hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC) serum protein, albumin, globulin and lysozyme activity) were significantly higher in fish fed on probiotic treated diets compared to the control ( < 0.05). On the contrary, fish fed on Diet 6 presented significantly similar Hb and globulin values compared to the control (P > 0.05). Additionally, fish fed on probiotic treated diets retained the probiotics in their guts and lower microbial load was realized in their muscle ( < 0.05).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of H1PV infection on rat gut . Inbred Wistar rats were infected with H1PV by routine gavage and clinical signs were recorded. Gross anatomical and histopathological examination of the gut was performed, as was immune cytokine analysis. The cecal contents were also collected for 16S rRNA sequencing. Gross anatomical examination showed distention of the ileum associated with flatulence after infection, while histopathological examination showed hyperemia and inflammatory cell infiltration in the ileum. Upregulation of the interleukin-6 in sera in H1PV infected rats was also detected. The gut  had been significantly changed in H1PV infected rats: there was a reduction in several bacteria species including probiotic bacteria from the genera Parabacteroides and Butyricicoccus, while others were increased, including those from the genera Methanobrevibacter and Syntrophococcus. Taken together, these results demonstrate that chronic H1PV infection in rats leads to gastrointestinal inflammation with flatulence. The gut  alterations were associated with decreased polymorphisms, reduced abundance of probiotic bacteria and increased abundance of methane-producing bacteria.© FEMS 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659380>Cervical cancer and vaginal  changes.</a></h1><p>Microbial changes in vaginal ecosystem may accelerate the process of cervical carcinogenesis.

The heritability of  IgG was estimated using a mixed model that included fixed effects for age and sex and random kinship effect. Of 2017 Old Order Amish participants, 1098 had positive titers (54.4%). The heritability for  serointensity was estimated to be 0.22 ( = 1.7 × 10 and for seropositivity, it was estimated to be 0.28 ( = 1.9 × 10). Shared household environmental effects (i.e., household effects) were also determined. Household effects, modeled as a random variable, were assessed as the phenotypic covariance between any two individuals who had the same current address (i.e., contemporaneous household), and nuclear household (i.e., the phenotypic covariance between parents and children only, not other siblings or spouses). Household effects did not account for a significant proportion of variance in either  serointensity or  seropositivity. Our results suggest a significant familial aggregation of  serointensity and seropositivity with significant heritability. The shared household does not contribute significantly to family aggregation with , suggesting that there are possible unmeasured non-household shared and non-shared environmental factors that may play a significant role.

Heart failure (HF) is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases worldwide; however, whether GM dysbiosis participates in the development of HF remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the specific changes in GM composition and function in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced HF in rats.The rats were divided into C (control), 4w-HF (ISO, 2. mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, intraperitoneally), and 2w-HF (ISO, 2. mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, intraperitoneally) groups. The cardiac structure and function in rats were assessed, and metagenomic analyses were then performed. Compared with the healthy control group, we found that the Shannon diversity index and microbial gene count in the 4w-HF and 2w-HF groups was drastically decreased. High-throughput sequencing showed that the three groups differed in intestinal bacterial community composition. Overgrowth of bacteria, such as Prevotella, was observed in the 4w-HF group, with reduced growth of bacteria, such as Roseburia, Lactobacillus, and Butyrivibrio, associated with healthy status compared with the C group on the genus level. Concomitant with the alteration of GM composition, underrepresentation of health-linked microbial function was observed in both the 4w-HF and 2w-HF groups compared with the C group.Iso-induced HF rats showed a significant decrease in the diversity and richness of the intestinal , with a downregulation of the key intestinal bacterial groups and overgrowth of bacteria considered to be involved in inflammatory responses as well as a decrease in health-linked microbial function.

The lack of alternative antimicrobial strategies to control this disease is mainly due to limited insight into the relationship between NE pathogenesis, , and host responses. Here we showed that the microbial metabolic byproduct of secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA), at as low as 50 µM, inhibited 82.8% of C. perfringens growth in Tryptic Soy Broth (P < 0.05). Sequential Eimeria maxima and C. perfringens challenges significantly induced NE, severe intestinal inflammation, and body weight (BW) loss in broiler chickens. These negative effects were diminished (P < 0.05) by 1. g/kg DCA diet. At the cellular level, DCA alleviated NE-associated ileal epithelial death and significantly reduced lamina propria cell apoptosis. Interestingly, DCA reduced C. perfringens invasion into ileum (P < 0.05) without altering the bacterial ileal luminal colonization. Molecular analysis showed that DCA significantly reduced inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, Il1β, and Mmp9 mRNA accumulation in ileal tissue. Mechanism studies revealed that C. perfringens induced (P < 0.05) elevated expression of inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, and Ptgs2 (Cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2) gene) in chicken splenocytes. Inhibiting the COX signaling by aspirin significantly attenuated INFγ-induced inflammatory response in the splenocytes. Consistent with the in vitro assay, chickens fed 0.12 g/kg aspirin diet protected the birds against NE-induced BW loss, ileal inflammation, and intestinal cell apoptosis. In conclusion, microbial metabolic product DCA prevents NE-induced BW loss and ileal inflammation through attenuating inflammatory response. These novel findings of  protecting birds against NE provide new options on developing next generation antimicrobial alternatives against NE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612141>Administration of  KBL375 Causes Taxonomic and Functional Changes in Gut  Leading to Improvement of Atopic Dermatitis.</a></h1><p>Gut  play an important role in immune responses and energy metabolism.

Administration of  KBL375 significantly decreased dermatitis score, ear and dorsal thickness, and serum immunoglobulin E level in AD-induced mice. Significant reductions in mast cells and eosinophils were discovered in skin tissues from  KBL375-treated mice. T helper 2 cell-related cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-, IL-13, and IL-31 significantly decreased, and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 or transforming growth factor-β increased in skin tissues from  KBL375-treated mice. In addition to phenotypic changes in skin tissues,  KBL375 treatment induced an increase in the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cell population in mesenteric lymph nodes. Taxonomic and functional analyses of gut  showed significantly higher cecum bacterial diversities and abundances including genus , and  in  KBL375-treated mice. Metabolic analysis of the cecum also showed significant changes in the levels of various amino acids including methionine, phenylalanine, serine, and tyrosine, as well as short chain fatty acids such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate in AD-induced mice due to  KBL375 treatment. These altered metabolites in AD-induced mice returned to the levels similar to those in control mice when treated with  KBL375.

Usually BS is typically found in individuals in prepubertal age, even though it has been identified in adults associated with microbial exchange and / or with iron metabolism disorders. Microbial exchange concerns the possible exchange of bacteria between family members which can take place directly, through effusions, or indirectly, through brushes, cutlery or glasses. For this reason, it is recommended that toothbrushes of family members not be left damp and in contact with each other. The bathroom, being a warm-humid environment, is in fact an optimal habitat for microbial proliferation. Of specific importance in BS is the accumulation of iron in tissues and secretions which, together with chromogenic bacteria, are the primary cause of this pathology. In fact, among the metabolic products synthesized by bacteria in the oral cavity, hydrogen sulfide is of considerable interest, since upon reacting with iron available in saliva, in pathological conditions (iron metabolism disorders), it forms black precipitates consisting of ferric sulfide. These precipitates bind to the surface of the teeth, tending to form a stria that usually follows the contour of the gingiva, with an unsightly and variable chromatic intensity. In physiological situations, iron homeostasis is defined as the state of equilibrium between iron present in tissues and in secretions and that which is present in the circulation. Instead, in pathological conditions, defined as iron metabolism disorders, there is an accumulation of iron in tissues and secretions and a lack of it in the circulation. It is also important to remember that subjects affected by BS are more protected from carious processes than healthy subjects, probably due to a significant predominance of chromogenic bacteria compared to those responsible for caries. It should also be remembered that in young subjects BS tends to regress with pubertal development and the transition to adult life. In any case, using common professional hygiene procedures, it is possible to remove BS as well as plaque and tartar deposits. In particular, with ultrasonic scalers, polishing pastes and powders carried by air and water jets, the surfaces of the teeth can be restored to their natural healthy state. All the techniques for removing the precipitates, are not enough however, to fix and permanently eradicate their appearance, as these precipitates last only for short periods and recur very frequently. Due to the frequent recurrences, new oral  control therapies are emerging; among these the use of lactoferrin (Lf) in the dental field and particularly in the treatment of BS appears to be very promising. Taken togheter, here the effect of Lf in subjects affected by BS has been investigated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594820>Live and Diet by Your Gut .</a></h1><p>Diet influences health in multiple ways.

The composition of the mosquitoes'  plays a role in P. falciparum transmission, so we studied midgut bacterial communities of An. gambiae s.l from Burkina Faso. DNA was extracted from 17 pools of midgut of mosquitoes from the Anopheles gambiae complex from six localities in three climatic areas, including cotton-growing and cotton-free localities to include potential differences in insecticide selection pressure. The v3-v4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was targeted and sequenced using Illumina Miseq (2 × 250 nt). Diversity analysis was performed using QIIME and R software programs. The major bacterial phylum was Proteobacteria (97.2%) in all samples. The most abundant genera were Enterobacter (32.8%) and Aeromonas (29.8%), followed by Pseudomonas (11.8%), Acinetobacter (.9%) and Thorsellia (2.2%). No statistical difference in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was found (Kruskal-Wallis FDR-p > 0.05) among the different areas, fields or localities. Richness and diversity indexes (observed OTUs, Chao1, Simpson and Shannon indexes) showed significant differences in the cotton-growing fields and in the agroclimatic zones, mainly in the Sudano-Sahelian area. OTUs from seven bacterial species that mediate refractoriness to Plasmodium infection in An. gambiae s.l were detected. The beta diversity analysis did not show any significant difference. Therefore, a same control strategy of using bacterial species refractoriness to Plasmodium to target mosquito midgut bacterial community and affect their fitness in malaria transmission may be valuable tool for future malaria control efforts in Burkina Faso.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575764>Deleterious Effects of Neonicotinoid Pesticides on Drosophila melanogaster Immune Pathways.</a></h1><p>Neonicotinoid insecticides are common agrochemicals that are used to kill pest insects and improve crop yield. However, sublethal exposure can exert unintentional toxicity to honey bees and other beneficial pollinators by dysregulating innate immunity. Generation of hydrogen peroxide (HO) by the dual oxidase (Duox) pathway is a critical component of the innate immune response, which functions to impede infection and maintain homeostatic regulation of the gut . Despite the importance of this pathway in gut immunity, the consequences of neonicotinoid exposure on Duox signaling have yet to be studied. Here, we use a  model to investigate the hypothesis that imidacloprid (a common neonicotinoid) can affect the Duox pathway. The results demonstrated that exposure to sublethal imidacloprid reduced HO production by inhibiting transcription of the  gene. Furthermore, the reduction in  expression was found to be a result of imidacloprid interacting with the midgut portion of the immune deficiency pathway. This impairment led to a loss of microbial regulation, as exemplified by a compositional shift and increased total abundance of  and  spp. (dominant  members) found in the gut. In addition, we demonstrated that certain probiotic lactobacilli could ameliorate Duox pathway impairment caused by imidacloprid, but this effect was not directly dependent on the Duox pathway itself. This study is the first to demonstrate the deleterious effects that neonicotinoids can have on Duox-mediated generation of HO and highlights a novel coordination between two important innate immune pathways present in insects. Sublethal exposure to certain pesticides (e.g., neonicotinoid insecticides) is suspected to contribute to honey bee () population decline in North America. Neonicotinoids are known to interfere with immune pathways in the gut of insects, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We used a  model to understand how imidacloprid (a common neonicotinoid) interferes with two innate immune pathways-Duox and Imd. We found that imidacloprid dysregulates these pathways to reduce hydrogen peroxide production, ultimately leading to a dysbiotic shift in the gut . Intriguingly, we found that presupplementation with probiotic bacteria could mitigate the harmful effects of imidacloprid. Thus, these observations uncover a novel mechanism of pesticide-induced immunosuppression that exploits the interconnectedness of two important insect immune pathways.Copyright © 2019 Chmiel et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638148>Effects of oats on gastrointestinal health as assessed by in vitro, animal, and human studies.</a></h1><p>Oats are uniquely nutritious, owing to their composition of bioactive compounds, lipids, and β-glucan. Scientific research has established that oats can improve diet quality, reduce cholesterol, regulate satiety, and protect against carcinogenesis in the colon; however, determining the effects of oats on gastrointestinal health and the gut  is a newer, evolving area of research. To better understand the effects of oats on gastrointestinal health in humans, a literature review with predefined search criteria was conducted using the PubMed database and keywords for common gastrointestinal health outcomes. Moreover, to examine the gastrointestinal effects of oats across the scientific spectrum, a similar search strategy was executed to identify animal studies. In vitro studies were identified from the reference lists of human and animal studies. A total of 8 human studies, 19 animal studies, and  in vitro studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. The evidence in humans shows beneficial effects of oats on gastrointestinal health, with supportive evidence provided by in vitro and animal studies. The effective dose of oats varies by type, although an amount providing 2. to 2.9 g of β-glucan per day was shown to decrease fecal pH and alter fecal bacteria. For oat bran, 40 to 100 g/d was shown to increase fecal bacterial mass and short-chain fatty acids in humans. Differences in study design, methodology, and type of oats tested make valid comparisons difficult. The identification of best practices for the design of oat studies should be a priority in future research, as the findings will be useful for determining how oats influence specific indices of gastrointestinal health, including the composition of the human gut .© The Author(s) 2019.

Here, we developed an efficient strategy for joint-domain analysis, applying it to an analysis of correlations between colon epithelium methylomics and fecal microbiomics data with colorectal cancer risk as estimated by colorectal polyp prevalence. First, we applied domain-specific standard pipelines for quality assessment, cleaning, batch-effect removal, et cetera. Second, we performed variable homogenization for both the methylation and  data sets, using domain-specific normalization and dimension reduction, obtaining scale-free variables that could be compared across the two domains. Finally, we implemented a joint-domain network analysis to identify relevant microbial-methylation island patterns. The network analysis considered all possible species-island pairs, thus being quadratic in its complexity. However, we were able to pre-select the unpaired variables by performing a preliminary association analysis on the outcome polyp prevalence. All results from association and interaction analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Although the limited sample size did not provide good power (80% to detect medium to large effect sizes with % alpha error), a number of potentially significant association (dozens in the uncorrected analysis, reducing to just a few in the corrected one) were identified As a last step, we linked the network patterns identified by our approach to the KEGG functional ontology, showing that the method can generate new mechanistic hypotheses for the biological causes of polyp development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647207>Autophagy: A Novel Mechanism Involved in the Anti-Inflammatory Abilities of Probiotics.</a></h1><p>Deregulation of the complex interaction among host genetics, gut  and environmental factors on one hand and aberrant immune responses on the other hand, are known to be associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease. Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD). Probiotics may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative colitis patients, probiotics remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti-inflammatory capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced murine model of colitis. The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of colitis that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of probiotics.© Copyright by the Author(s).

A total of 116 overweight or obese participants were assigned randomly either to 10 g inulin plus 10 g resistant maltodextrin or to 20 g of placebo supplementation through 400 mL of milk a day, while on a - 500 kcal/day energy restricted diet.Altogether, 86 participants completed the intervention. There were no significant differences in weight loss or body composition between the groups. The fibre supplement reduced systolic (.35 ± 2.4 mmHg, p = 0.043) and diastolic (2.82 ± 1.3 mmHg, p = 0.047) blood pressure to a larger extent than placebo. Furthermore, a larger decrease in serum insulin was observed in the placebo group compared to the fibre group (- 26.0 ± 9.2 pmol/L, p = 0.006). The intake of fibre induced changes in the composition of gut  resulting in higher abundances of Parabacteroides and Bifidobacteria, compared to placebo. The effects on blood pressure and glucose metabolism were mainly observed in women, and could be attributed to a higher gut  diversity after intervention. Finally, the fibre group experienced a higher degree of gastrointestinal symptoms, which attenuated over time.Supplementation of inulin and resistant maltodextrin did not provide an additional weight loss during an energy-restricted diet, but reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

The following items were used to evaluate responses: body surface area (BSA), psoriasis area and severity index (PASI), dermatology life quality index (DLQI), histological examination, intestinal symptoms, adverse reactions and serum level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. After second FMT treatment for  weeks, aforementioned items were improved greatly compared with those before treatment.

Here, we developed a novel IBS rat model combining trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) (designated as TC-IBS) and compared it with the TNBS-induced and CUMS-induced models. TC-IBS showed a pronounced depression phenotype with increased corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor (CRHR)1 and CRHR2 expression at the frontal cortex and increased serum ACTH concentration. Visceral hypersensitivity (VH), as evidenced by colorectal distention (CRD) test, was highest in TC-IBS, accompanied by increased serum -hydroxytryptamine (-HT) level and colonic -HT receptor 3A (-HTR)/-HT receptor 2B expression, impaired tight junction protein expression including occludin, zonula occludens-1, and phosphorylated myosin light chain. Palonosetron, a second generation of -HTR antagonist, alleviated VH significantly in TC-IBS. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that TNBS plus CUMS induced a significant disturbance of the gut . Cytokine profile analysis of TC-IBS model indicated an innate immune activation both in serum and colonic mucosa. Further, fecal  transplantation improved VH and some pathophysiological changes in TC-IBS.

We present a general model to explore the optimal investment in host immunity under conditions in which the host can, versus cannot easily distinguish among commensal versus pathogenic bacteria, and when commensal  can, versus cannot protect the host against the impacts of pathogen infection. We find that a loss of immune vigilance associated with innate immunity over evolutionary time can occur due to the challenge of discriminating between pathogenic and other microbe species. Further, we find the greater the protective effect of  species, acting either directly or via competition with a pathogen, or the higher the costs of immunity, the more likely the loss of immune vigilance is. Conversely, this effect can be reversed when pathogens increase host mortality. Generally, the magnitude of costs of immunity required to allow evolution of decreased immune vigilance are predicted to be lowest when  and pathogen species most resemble each other (in terms of host recognition), and when immune effects on the pathogen are weak. Our model framework makes explicit the core trade-offs likely to shape the evolution of immunity in the context of /pathogen discrimination. We discuss how this informs interpretation of patterns and process in natural systems, including vulnerability to pathogen emergence.© 2019 The Author(s).

The frequency and type of antibiotic prescription for patients who subsequently developed RA were compared with antibiotic prescriptions in a control group of patients who remained free of RA. Cases, defined as patients with a new diagnosis of RA made between 2006 and 2018, were matched with up to four RA-free controls on practice, age, gender and date of diagnosis. Exposure was measured by the number and type of prescriptions for antibiotics prior to the RA diagnosis or to the index date in controls.A total of 8482 patients with a new diagnosis of RA between 2006 and 2018 were compared with 22 661 controls. There was a higher likelihood of an RA diagnosis after antibiotic prescriptions within 1 year,  years and ever with a strong dose-response. Patients receiving >10 antibiotics in a  year period were more than twice as likely to receive an RA diagnosis as controls [adjusted odds ratio 2.65 (CI 2.40, 2.93)].Exposure to antibiotics prior to the diagnosis was a significant risk factor for RA. This could reflect an immunological response to a compromised . Alternatively, patients with pre-symptomatic or early undiagnosed RA may have been more likely to present to their general practitioner with infections due to an unrecognized effect of RA.© The Author(s) 2019.

Recent evidence suggests that the gut  is associated with tacrolimus dosing requirements and direct metabolism of tacrolimus. We hypothesize that administration of antibiotics, which are known to alter the gut , is associated with tacrolimus trough variability.We conducted a retrospective chart review of subjects who received kidney transplants at our institution from 2012 to 2013 and evaluated subjects who received antibiotics during the first month of transplantation (Abx Group, N = 60) and subjects who did not (No Abx Group, N = 200). We evaluated whether antibiotic administration in the Abx Group had increased tacrolimus trough concentrations and concentration over tacrolimus dosage (C/D) after antibiotic administration. We also evaluated tacrolimus variability as measured by standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation between the Abx Group and No Abx Group.In the Abx Group, tacrolimus trough concentration over tacrolimus dosage (C/D) increased 7 and 15 days after antibiotic administration ( = 0.001,  = 0.07, respectively, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). From postoperative day 31-45, the variability in tacrolimus trough levels in the Abx Group as measured by SD and coefficient of variation was significantly higher than the variability in the No Abx Group ( = 0.03,  = 0.02, Wilcoxon rank sum test, respectively).Our identification of antibiotic administration as a potentially new risk factor for tacrolimus trough variability suggests the need to carefully follow tacrolimus trough levels after antibiotic administration.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Old age alters our metabolic and regenerative capacity. Following recruitment of 65 human subjects in the age range of 70 to 82, we discerned healthy aging (HA) and non-healthy aging (NHA) cohorts discordant in the occurrence of one or more major diseases: (1) cancer, (2) acute or chronic cardiovascular diseases, (3) acute or chronic pulmonary diseases, (4) diabetes, and () stroke or neurodegenerative disorders. We analyzed these cohorts' oral microbiomes (saliva) and gut microbiomes (stool) to assess diversity and identify microbial biomarkers for HA. In contrast to the gut  where no change was observed, we found that the saliva  had higher α-diversity in the HA compared with the NHA group. We observed the genus Akkermansia to be significantly more abundant in the gut  of the HA group. Akkermansia muciniphila is a colonic mucin-degrading bacterium believed to have beneficial effects on gastrointestinal health, particularly in the context of diabetes and obesity. Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 was a taxon increased in abundance in the HA cohort.

Selective enrichment of microbial consortia was done using the glycerol-based medium at initial stage, followed by purification to isolated colonies, after positive HPLC detection of 1,3-PDO in the fermentation broth. When the purified isolated were re-tested for 1,3-PDO production, only two isolates namely Isolate 1 and 3 were capable of producing the targeted product preferably under anaerobic conditions. On account of better 1,3-PDO fermentation efficiency (Isolate 3, 22% vs Isolate 1, 4.48%) and acetic acid as the only major by-product, Isolate 3 was shortlisted for further studies. A dye based technique was devised in which bromothymol blue was incorporated in the medium to monitor the pH drop due to acetic acid formation and hence change in color. Visual change in color helped in intermittent pH restoration. During fermentation, with pH stat being 8-8., Isolate 3 at 32°C yielded 0.67 mol mol 1,3-PDO within a short span of 12 h only with an initial concentration of glycerol being 20 g L . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Isolate 3 shared 95.8% homology with C. freundii CFNIH1 and hence designated as Citrobacter freundii IIP DR3.The present study demonstrated that during bioprospecting glycerol assimilating , dye-based technique can be successfully employed. This technique can further be exploited to monitor consistent production of all microbial secondary metabolites that accompanies acid production.Incorporation of "Bromothymol blue" can visually help in the identification of pH drop in the medium, so that pH stat can be easily maintained during 1,3-PDO production from glycerol especially under shake flask conditions.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593953>Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Celiac Disease: Distinct Autoimmune Disorders That Share Common Pathogenic Mechanisms.</a></h1><p>The relatively common co-occurrence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD) suggests these disorders share common pathogenic etiologies.T1D and CD are strongly linked to closely related high-risk human lymphocyte antigens (HLA-DR-DQ). High-risk HLA molecules bind specific fragments of gluten or the islet self-antigen(s) and present these antigens to antigen-responsive T cells. In an appropriate proinflammatory environment, the autoimmune response results in destruction of the intestinal enterocyte and/or the pancreatic beta cell. Environmental factors have been implicated in the etiology of T1D and CD because (1) identical twins are only partially concordant for these disorders and (2) incidence rates of T1D and CD have been steadily rising for decades. Prospective studies in infants genetically predisposed to T1D and CD showed that antibody positivity to both disorders begins in the first 1-3 years of life. Viral infections and early exposure to gluten or cow's milk in the infant diet have been implicated in disease pathogenesis. However, delaying introduction of gluten in the infant diet until 12 months of age had no impact on the development of islet or celiac autoimmunity. Weaning nursing infants to hydrolyzed infant formula had no impact on the development of T1D. Viral infections have been suspected of playing a role in T1D pathogenesis for decades. A large international prospective study (TEDDY) has shown increased risk of T1D autoimmunity particularly when > respiratory infections or febrile infections have occurred in the 9 months preceding the appearance of islet antibodies. Provocative data in animal models of T1D suggest the  may play an important role in the pathogenesis of T1D. Breastfeeding, diet, infections, antibiotics, and method of birth alter the composition of the . Human data indicate subtle differences in the  of children with T1D autoimmunity, while intestinal dysbiosis has been clearly demonstrated in CD. Alterations of the integrity of the intestinal mucosa plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CD, and the NOD mouse model suggests an important role of a leaky intestinal epithelium in T1D as well. Key Message: Immunogenetics and the environment are closely interrelated in the pathogenesis of T1D and CD. Large well-designed prospective studies in at-risk populations informed by scientifically rigorous studies in animal models are likely to have the greatest impact on our understanding of the complex pathogenesis of these detrimental autoimmune disorders.© 2019 S.

Recent evidence has shown a significant connection between gut  and brain function, as butyrate production by microorganisms is believed to activate the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). To investigate whether modification of intestinal  could impact cognitive decline in the aging brain, Romo-Araiza . conducted a study to test how probiotic and prebiotic supplementation impacted spatial and associative memory in middle-aged rats. Their results showed that rats supplemented with the symbiotic (both probiotic and prebiotic) treatment performed significantly better than other groups in the spatial memory test, though not in that of associative memory. Their data also reported that this improvement correlated with increased levels of BDNF, decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and better electrophysiological outcomes in the hippocampi of the symbiotic group.

Control mice received a standard diet, whereas obese mice were fed HFD. The treatment was followed for  weeks, and animal body weight periodically assessed. At the end of the treatment, metabolic plasma analysis (including lipid profile) as well as glucose and insulin levels were performed. The HFD-induced inflammatory status was studied in liver and fat, by determining the RNA expression of different inflammatory mediators by qPCR; also, different markers of intestinal epithelial barrier function were determined in colonic tissue by qPCR. Additionally, flow cytometry of immune cells from adipose tissue, endothelial dysfunction in aortic rings as well as gut  composition were evaluated. Faecal  transplantation (FMT) to antibiotic-treated mice fed with HFD was performed.OLE administration reduced body weight gain, basal glycaemia and insulin resistance, and showed improvement in plasma lipid profile when compared with HFD-fed mice. The extract significantly ameliorated the HFD-induced altered expression of key adipogenic genes, like PPARs, adiponectin and leptin receptor, in adipose tissue. Furthermore, the extract reduced the RNA expression of Tnf-α, Il-1β, Il-6 in liver and adipose tissue, thus improving the tissue inflammatory status associated to obesity. The flow cytometry analysis in adipose tissue corroborated these observations. Additionally, the characterization of the colonic  by sequencing showed that OLE administration was able to counteract the dysbiosis associated to obesity. The extract reversed the endothelial dysfunction observed in the aortic rings of obese mice. FMT from donors HFD-OLE to recipient mice fed an HFD prevented the development of obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction.OLE exerts beneficial effects in HFD-induced obesity in mice, which was associated to an improvement in plasma and tissue metabolic profile, inflammatory status, gut  composition and vascular dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We show here that two clustered terpene synthase and cytochrome P450 encoding genes (TPS11 and CYP706A3) on chromosome  of Arabidopsis thaliana are tightly co-expressed in floral tissues, upon anthesis and during floral bud development. TPS11 was previously reported to generate a blend of sesquiterpenes. By heterologous co-expression of TPS11 and CYP706A3 in yeast and Nicotiana benthamiana, we demonstrate that CYP706A3 metabolizes TPS11 products and also further oxidizes its primary oxidation products. Analysis of headspace and soluble metabolites of CYP706A3 insertion and overexpression mutants indicates that CYP706A3-mediated metabolism largely suppresses sesquiterpene and most monoterpene emission from opening flowers, and generates terpene oxides retained in floral tissues. In flower buds, concerted expression of TPS11 and CYP706A3 also suppresses volatile emission and generates soluble sesquiterpene oxides. Florivory assays performed with the Brassicaceae specialist Plutella xylostella demonstrate that insect larvae avoid feeding on bud expressing CYP706A3 and accumulating terpene oxides. In addition, CYP706A3 expression deeply alters composition of the floral .

In CHCL-treated steers, the mean MIC of ceftiofur in E. coli peaked at 48 hours (mean MIC = 20.45 ug/ml, 95% CI = 10.29-40.63 ug/ml), and in CCFA-treated steers, mean MIC peaked at 96 hours (mean MIC = 10.68 ug/ml, 95% CI = .47-20.85 ug/ml). Shifts in the  of steers in both groups were due to reductions in Firmicutes and increases in Bacteroidetes. CCFA leads to prolonged, low intestinal drug concentrations, and is associated with decreased E. coli concentration, an increased MIC of ceftiofur in E. coli at specific time points, and shifts in the fecal . CHCL led to higher intestinal drug concentrations over a shorter duration. Effects on E. coli concentration and the  were smaller in this group, but the increase in the MIC of ceftiofur in fecal E. coli was similar.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641304>Studies on immune response to Newcastle disease virus in broiler chickens fed with  PIA16 isolated from the gut of indigenous chicken of Assam, India.</a></h1><p>The chicken gut harbors microflora which impacts the health, production performance and immune response against pathogens.

This study aimed to investigate the individual effect of two strains of  PIA16 isolated separately from cecum and jejunum of Assam indigenous chicken on the immunity of broiler chickens against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) when fed singly and in combination with a prebiotic.A total of 240 birds (48 per group) were vaccinated with Lasota strain of NDV on the  and 21 day of age. Blood samples were collected before and after immunization against ND for the detection of humoral antibody response by hemagglutination inhibition test. The cell-mediated immune (CMI) response was estimated through response to phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA-P) and expressed as web index.A significant influence on the immune response to NDV was observed in all the  PIA16 as well as mannan oligosaccharide (MOS) supplemented groups revealing higher antibody titer than the control counterpart. The CMI response revealed a better cutaneous basophilic hypersensitivity response to PHA-P in the treated groups than the control.Enhancement in immunity was perceived in the broilers fed with .

However, the relative importance of these processes in shaping riverine microeukaryotic biogeography is still poorly understood. Here, we compared the spatiotemporal and biogeographical patterns of microeukaryotic community using high-throughput sequencing of 18S rRNA gene and multivariate statistical analyses from a subtropical river during wet and dry seasons.Our results provide the first description of biogeographical patterns of microeukaryotic communities in the Tingjiang River, the largest river in the west of Fujian province, southeastern China. The results showed that microeukaryotes from both wet and dry seasons exhibited contrasting community compositions, which might be owing to planktonic microeukaryotes having seasonal succession patterns. Further, all components of the microeukaryotic communities (including total, dominant, always rare, and conditionally rare taxa) exhibited a significant distance-decay pattern in both seasons, and these communities had a stronger distance-decay relationship during the dry season, especially for the conditionally rare taxa. Although several variables had a significant influence on the microeukaryotic communities, the environmental and spatial factors showed minor roles in shaping the communities. Importantly, these microeukaryotic communities were strongly driven by stochastic processes, with 89.9%, 88.%, and 89.6% of the community variation explained by neutral community model during wet, dry, and both seasons, respectively. The neutral community model also explained a large fraction of the community variation across different taxonomic groups and levels. Additionally, the microeukaryotic taxa, which were above and below the neutral prediction, were ecologically and taxonomically distinct groups, which might be interactively structured by deterministic and stochastic processes.This study demonstrated that stochastic processes are sufficient in shaping substantial variation in river microeukaryotic metacommunity across different hydrographic regimes, thereby providing a better understanding of spatiotemporal patterns, processes, and mechanisms of microeukaryotic community in waters.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640585>Molecular characterization of Blastocystis subtypes in HIV-positive patients and evaluation of risk factors for colonization.</a></h1><p>Blastocystis is one of the most common intestinal protozoa in human faecal samples with uncertain impact on public health. Studies on the prevalence of Blastocystis in HIV-positive patients are limited and dated.A cross-sectional study was carried out involving 156 HIV-positive patients to evaluate the prevalence of Blastocystis-subtypes by molecular amplification and sequencing the small subunit rRNA gene (SSU rDNA), to identify the risk factors for its transmission, to examine the relationship between the presence of the protist and gastrointestinal disorders. Furthermore, the evaluation of the faecal calprotectin by immunoassay from a sample of subjects was performed to evaluate the gut inflammation in Blastocystis-carriers.Blastocystis-subtypes ST1, ST2, ST3, ST4 were identified in 39 HIV-positive patients (25%). No correlation was found between the presence of the protist and virological or epidemiological risk factors. Blastocystis was more frequently detected in homosexual subjects (p = 0.037) infected by other enteric protozoa (p = 0.0001) and with flatulence (p = 0.024). No significant differences in calprotectin level was found between Blastocystis-carriers and free ones.Blastocystis is quite common in HIV-positive patients on ART showing in examined patients 25% prevalence. Homosexual behaviour may represent a risk factor for its transmission, while CD4 count and viremia didn't correlate with the presence of the protist. The pathogenetic role of Blastocystis remains unclear and no gut inflammation status was detected in Blastocystis-carriers.

The diet was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire. One unit of NNSs was 100 mL beverage with NNSs or 2 tablets/teaspoons of NNSs. The faecal  was assessed with GA-map® dysbiosis test and SCFA with gas chromatography and flame ionisation detection. Fourteen men and 75 women with a mean age of 44.6 (SD 8.7) years, BMI 41.8 (SD 3.6) kg/m, and intake of NNSs 7. units/day (SD 3.2; range 0-43) were included. Faecal butyric acid was positively and negatively associated with the intake of starch (partial correlation = 0.264; =0.015) and NNSs (partial correlation = -0.274; =0.011), respectively. NNSs were associated with changes in four out of 39 bacterial groups. Butyric acid has antiobesogenic effects, reduces insulin resistance, and improves dyslipidaemia. Since the weight-reducing effect of NNSs on obese adults trying to lose weight is dubious, it seems imprudent to use NNSs that might counteract the favourable effects of butyric acid.Copyright © 2019 Per G.

A dysbiotic gut  can cause low-grade inflammation, and  composition was linked to cardiovascular disease risk. However, the role of this environmental factor in atherothrombosis remains undefined. To analyze the impact of gut  on atherothrombosis, we rederived low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient ( ) mice as germfree (GF) and kept these mice for 16 weeks on an atherogenic high-fat Western diet (HFD) under GF isolator conditions and under conventionally raised specific-pathogen-free conditions (CONV-R). In spite of reduced diversity of the cecal gut , caused by atherogenic HFD, GF  mice and CONV-R  mice exhibited atherosclerotic lesions of comparable sizes in the common carotid artery. In contrast to HFD-fed mice, showing no difference in total cholesterol levels, CONV-R  mice fed control diet (CD) had significantly reduced total plasma cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and LDL levels compared with GF  mice. Myeloid cell counts in blood as well as leukocyte adhesion to the vessel wall at the common carotid artery of GF  mice on HFD were diminished compared to CONV-R  controls. Plasma cytokine profiling revealed reduced levels of the proinflammatory chemokines CCL7 and CXCL1 in GF  mice, whereas the T-cell-related interleukin 9 (IL-9) and IL-27 were elevated. In the atherothrombosis model of ultrasound-induced rupture of the common carotid artery plaque, thrombus area was significantly reduced in GF  mice relative to CONV-R  mice. , this atherothrombotic phenotype was explained by decreased adhesion-dependent platelet activation and thrombus growth of HFD-fed GF  mice on type III collagen. Our results demonstrate a functional role for the commensal  in atherothrombosis. In a ferric chloride injury model of the carotid artery, GF C57BL/6J mice had increased occlusion times compared to colonized controls. Interestingly, in late atherosclerosis, HFD-fed GF  mice had reduced plaque rupture-induced thrombus growth in the carotid artery and diminished  thrombus formation under arterial flow conditions.Copyright © 2019 Kiouptsi et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586220>In-Vitro Prebiotic Analysis of  Accessible Pectic Polysaccharides.</a></h1><p>Pectin is a diverse polysaccharide comprising of polygalacturonic acid, rhamnogalactouronan, and neutral polysaccharides (arabinan and arabinogalactan) as side chains or branches. They are resistant to salivary amylase and gastric juice. In the present study the prebiotic potentials of different pectic derived substrates were performed by using intestinal cultures and measuring the growth, change in pH and short chain fatty acid, (SCFA) production. Arabinan, arabinogalactan, and rhamnogalacturonan were fermented by probiotic bacteria such as Bifidobacterium breve, Bi. longum, Bi. bifidum, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (commensal bacteria). While, polygalacturonic acid was fermented by Ba. fragilis, Ba. thetaiotaomicron, and Ba. uniformis. All the screened bacteria significantly decreased the pH from 7 to  (pH difference of ≈ 2), which clearly indicated that the above bacteria produced the enzymes necessary for the digestion of the pectic derived polysaccharides. The SCFA profiles of the above screened bacteria clearly demonstrated the production of lactate, acetate and propionate which are the key metabolites involved in maintaining gut health and prevention of several intestinal diseases.

Most members of the root  possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host immunity and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root , including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root . In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic acid and its derivative 2-keto gluconic acid. Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic acids and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic acid-mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root immunity. Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root , as it facilitates colonization by beneficial root .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

With the aim of filling these knowledge gaps, we investigated the effect of different MHT treatment options on the risk of ovarian cancer. This prospective Swedish population-based matched-cohort study included all women ≥40 years having used systemic MHT between 2005 and 2012 (288,950 ever-users), group-level matched (1:3) to 866,546 nonusers. MHT use was ascertained from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Registry and data was linked to several national health data registries. Multivariable conditional logistic regression provided odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for parity, and comorbidities. Current EP-MHT use was associated with a modestly increased risk of ovarian cancer (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.18-1.62), while no consistent risk was found among past users (OR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.84-1.18). Current continuous testosterone derived (OR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.15-1.96) regimens increased the risk whereas progesterone derived (OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.00-2.21) regimens increased the risk marginally. Nonsignificant positive associations were observed for sequential regimens (OR = 1.87, 95% CI 0.70-.08; OR = 1.54, 95% CI 0.96-2.47, respectively). An inverse relationship was observed for all E-MHT use (OR = 0.25, 95% CI 0.22-0.29), but this association might partly be explained by underreporting of oophorectomies or tubal ligations. Current cutaneous EP-MHT (OR = 1.28, 95% CI 0.81-2.02) suggested a possibly lower risk than oral MHT (OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.25-1.75). In conclusion EP-MHT, notably continuous regimens, were associated with a modestly increased risk of ovarian cancer.

This model reproduces a similar situation to MS, as well as its relationship with intestinal  starting from the changes in bacterial lipopolysaccharide levels (LPS) in the outer wall of the gram-negative bacteria. Finally, the administration of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), hydroxytirosol (HT), and oleic acid (OA) exert beneficial effects.

In the present study, a real-time PCR for Blastocystis was performed on 1374 case samples and 1026 control samples from the multicenter gastroenteritis case-control study previously tested for D. fragilis. Prevalence of both micro-organisms was highest in children under 20 years of age and lowest in the oldest age group. A significantly lower overall detection of D. fragilis and Blastocystis was found in cases (both 25.8%) as compared to controls (37.6% and 40.0%, respectively). The difference for D. fragilis was statistically significant for subjects above 20 years of age. For Blastocystis, the difference was statistically significant in all age groups, except in children less than  years of age. A negative relation between D. fragilis-positive cases and diarrhea was found in this study population. More GE symptoms were reported in cases without D. fragilis or Blastocystis. In the present study, prevalence of both D. fragilis and Blastocystis is lower in cases with gastroenteritic symptoms than in controls.

One way in which  achieves this duality is through concealing or exposing cell wall pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in response to host-derived environment cues (pH, hypoxia, and lactate). This cell wall remodeling allows  to evade or hyperactivate the host's innate immune responses, leading to disease. Previously, we showed that adaptation of  to acidic environments, conditions encountered during colonization of the female reproductive tract, induces significant cell wall remodeling resulting in the exposure of two key fungal PAMPs (β-glucan and chitin). Here, we report that this pH-dependent cell wall remodeling is time dependent, with the initial change in pH driving cell wall unmasking, which is then remasked at later time points. Remasking of β-glucan was mediated via the cell density-dependent fungal quorum sensing molecule farnesol, while chitin remasking was mediated via a small, heat-stable, nonproteinaceous secreted molecule(s).

Paracellular permeability is governed by intercellular tight-junctions (TJs). Zonulin is, to date, the only known physiological regulator of intestinal TJs. We used a zonulin transgenic mouse (Ztm) model characterized by increased small intestinal permeability to elucidate the role of a primary impaired gut barrier on  composition and/or immune profile. Ztm exhibit an altered gene expression profile of TJs in the gut compared to wild-type mice (WT): Claudin-15, Claudin-, Jam-3, and Myosin-1C are decreased in the male duodenum whereas Claudin-15, Claudin-7, and ZO-2 are reduced in the female colon. These results are compatible with loss of gut barrier function and are paralleled by an altered  composition with reduced abundance of the genus , known to have positive effects on gut barrier integrity and strengthening, and an increased abundance of the  genus, associated to low-grade inflammatory conditions. Immune profile analysis shows a subtly skewed distribution of immune cell subsets toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype with more IL-17 producing adaptive and innate-like T cells in Ztm. Interestingly,  "normalization" involving the transfer of WT  into Ztm, did not rescue the altered immune profile. Our data suggest that a primary impaired gut barrier causing an uncontrolled trafficking of microbial products leads to a latent pro-inflammatory status, with a skewed  composition and immune profile that, in the presence of an environmental trigger, as we have previously described (1), might promote the onset of overt inflammation and an increased risk of chronic disease.Copyright © 2019 Miranda-Ribera, Ennamorati, Serena, Cetinbas, Lan, Sadreyev, Jain, Fasano and Fiorentino.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563898>Cigarette smoking and oral  in low-income and African-American populations.</a></h1><p>Cigarette smoking is a common risk factor for diseases and cancers.

Defects in such mechanisms can favour the development of chronic intestinal disorders, such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the principal forms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in humans, as well as systemic disorders. Over the last years, the frequency of intestinal and systemic immune-inflammatory disorders has increased in previously low incidence areas, likely due to the Westernization of lifestyles, including dietary habits. The Western diet is characterized by high consumption of proteins, saturated fats and sweets, as well as by a broad use of food additives (e.g., emulsifiers, bulking agents), which are used to preserve and enhance food quality. Accumulating evidence suggests that food additives can perturb gut homeostasis, thereby contributing to promote tissue-damaging inflammatory responses. For instance, mice given the emulsifiers carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate 80 develop dysbiosis with overgrowth of mucus-degrading bacteria. Such an effect triggers colitis in animals deficient in either interleukin-10, a cytokine exerting anti-inflammatory and regulatory functions, or Toll-like receptor , a receptor recognizing the bacterial flagellin. Similarly, the polysaccharide maltodextrin induces endoplasmic reticulum stress in intestinal goblet cells, thereby impairing mucus release and increasing host susceptibility to colitis.

To address this issue, we explored the responses of GF zebrafish by using two bacterial species at varying concentrations, colonization time points and exposure duration. Therefore, we mono-associated GF zebrafish with  DH5α or  WB800N at concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml either at 3 day post fertilization (dpf) or  dpf for 24 or 48 h. We evaluated the responses of GF zebrafish by analyzing the survival rate, colonization efficiency, nutrients metabolism, intestinal cell proliferation, innate immunity, stress, and behavior responses by comparing it to conventionally raised zebrafish (CONR) and GF zebrafish. The results indicated that the final bacteria concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml did not cause any mortality when GF mono-associated larvae were exposed to either  DH5α or  WB800N at 3 or  dpf, while concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml increased the mortality, particularly for  dpf owing to the decrease in dissolved oxygen level. The  DH5α mainly induced the expression of genes related to nutrients metabolism, cell proliferation and immunity, while  WB800N mainly upregulated the expression of genes related to immunity and stress responses. Moreover, our data revealed that GF zebrafish showed higher levels of physical activity than CONR and the microbial colonization reduced the hyperactivity of GF zebrafish, suggesting colonization of bacteria affected behavior characteristics.

This experiment evaluated the effects of a blend of prebiotics and dietary fibers on apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) and fecal metabolites related to gastrointestinal health in adult dogs. Four diets containing either % cellulose (control; CT), % dietary fiber and prebiotic blend (FP), 0.02% saccharin and eugenol (SE), or % fiber blend plus 0.02% saccharin and eugenol (FSE) were formulated to meet or exceed the AAFCO (2017) nutritional requirements for adult dogs. Eight adult female beagles (mean age 4.2 ± 1.1 yr; mean BW = 10.8 ± 1.4 kg; mean BCS = .8 ± 0.6) were randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 dietary treatments using a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design. Each experimental period consisted of 14 d (10 d of diet adaptation and 4 d of total and fresh fecal and total urine collection). All animals remained healthy throughout the study, with serum metabolites being within reference ranges for adult dogs. All diets were well accepted by the dogs, resulting in similar (P > 0.05) daily food intakes among treatments. Likewise, fecal output and scores did not differ (P > 0.05) among dietary treatments, with the latter being within the ideal range (2.-2.9) in a -point scale. All diets were highly digestible and had similar (P > 0.05) ATTD of dry matter (81.6%-84.4%), organic matter (86.4%-87.3%), and crude protein (86.6%-87.3%). However, total dietary fiber (TDF) digestibility was greater for dogs fed the FSE diet (P < 0.05) in contrast with dogs fed the CT and SE diets, whereas dogs fed FP diets had intermediate TDF digestibility, but not different from all other treatments. Fecal acetate and propionate concentrations were greater (P < 0.05) for dogs fed FP and FSE diets. Fecal concentrations of isobutyrate and isovalerate were greater for dogs fed CT (P < 0.05) compared with dogs fed the other three treatments. No shifts in fecal microbial richness and diversity were observed among dietary treatments. Overall, the data suggest that dietary supplementation of fiber and prebiotic blend was well tolerated by dogs, did not cause detrimental effects on fecal quality or nutrient digestibility, and resulted in beneficial shifts in fecal metabolites that may support gut health.© The Author(s) 2019.

In the present study, the effects of DADS on lipid metabolism and its potential role in the modulation of the gut  were determined. Hematoxylin and eosin and oil‑red O staining were used to assess the liver and intestinal tissues of mice treated with DADS. The expression of lipid metabolism‑associated genes was measured using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR). The effects of DADS on the gut  were measured using 16S recombinant (r)DNA gene analysis. The results revealed that the serum non‑esterified free fatty acids, high density lipoprotein‑cholesterol, low density lipoprotein‑cholesterol, serum total cholesterol, liver triglyceride and total cholesterol levels of the mice fed with a low‑dose of DADS was significantly higher when compared with the control. Hematoxylin and eosin and oil‑red O staining demonstrated that DADS induced fatty liver in mice. The results of the RT‑qPCR revealed that the expression levels of a number of lipid metabolism‑associated genes were altered in the livers of mice treated with DADS. The 16S rDNA gene analysis demonstrated that the mice fed on a normal diet treated with a low‑dose of DADS had decreased levels of bacteria from the Bacteroidetes phyla and increased levels of bacteria from the Firmicutes phyla. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed the top 20 pathways enriched in the low‑dose DADS group of mice fed with a normal diet. In the present study, low‑dose DADS induced fatty liver and altered the gut , similar to the phenotype induced by a high fat diet, by regulating the expression of lipid metabolism associated genes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594815> Symbiosis Genes Impact Microbial Interactions between Symbionts and Multikingdom Commensal Communities.</a></h1><p>The wild legume  engages in mutualistic symbiotic relationships with arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) fungi and nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. Using plants grown in natural soil and community profiling of bacterial 16S rRNA genes and fungal internal transcribed spacers (ITSs), we examined the role of the  symbiosis genes , , , and  in structuring bacterial and fungal root-associated communities. We found host genotype-dependent community shifts in the root and rhizosphere compartments that were mainly confined to bacteria in  or fungi in  mutants, while  and  plants displayed major changes across both microbial kingdoms. We observed in all AM mutant roots an almost complete depletion of a large number of Glomeromycota taxa that was accompanied by a concomitant enrichment of Helotiales and Nectriaceae fungi, suggesting compensatory niche replacement within the fungal community. A subset of Glomeromycota whose colonization is strictly dependent on the common symbiosis pathway was retained in  mutants, indicating that  is dispensable for intraradical colonization by some Glomeromycota fungi. However, intraradical colonization by bacteria belonging to the  and  is dependent on AM root infection, revealing a microbial interkingdom interaction. Despite the overall robustness of the bacterial root  against major changes in the composition of root-associated fungal assemblages, bacterial and fungal cooccurrence network analysis demonstrates that simultaneous disruption of AM and rhizobium symbiosis increases the connectivity among taxa of the bacterial root . Our findings imply a broad role for  symbiosis genes in structuring the root  and identify unexpected microbial interkingdom interactions between root symbionts and commensal communities. Studies on symbiosis genes in plants typically focus on binary interactions between roots and soilborne nitrogen-fixing rhizobia or mycorrhizal fungi in laboratory environments. We utilized wild type and symbiosis mutants of a model legume, grown in natural soil, in which bacterial, fungal, or both symbioses are impaired to examine potential interactions between the symbionts and commensal microorganisms of the root  when grown in natural soil. This revealed microbial interkingdom interactions between the root symbionts and fungal as well as bacterial commensal communities. Nevertheless, the bacterial root  remains largely robust when fungal symbiosis is impaired.

Further understanding of the intestinal  may help to establish alternative ways to treat, or even prevent, the disease.To explore alterations in fecal  profiles in SoJIA patients and to evaluate the correlations between  and clinical parameters.We conducted an observational single-center study at the Pediatric Department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Children who were diagnosed with SoJIA at our institution and followed for a minimum period of six months after diagnosis were recruited for the study. Healthy children were recruited as a control group (HS group) during the same period. Clinical data and stool samples were collected from SoJIA patients when they visited the hospital.The SoJIA group included 17 active and 15 inactive consecutively recruited children; the control group consisted of 32 children. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the two most abundant phyla among the total sample of SoJIA children and controls. There was a significant difference among the three groups in observed species, which was the highest in the Active-SoJIA group, followed by the Inactive-SoJIA group and then HS group (Active-SoJIA  HS:  = 0.000; and Inactive-SoJIA  HS:  = 0.005). We observed a lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in SoJIA patients (3.28 ± 4.47 in Active-SoJIA, .36 ± 8.39 in Inactive-SoJIA, and .67 ± 3.92 in HS). We also observed decreased abundances of Ruminococcaceae (14.9% in Active-SoJIA, 17.3% in Inactive-SoJIA, and 22.8% in HS; Active-SoJIA  HS:  = 0.005) and Faecalibacterium (.1% in Active-SoJIA, 9.9% in Inactive-SoJIA, and 13.0% in HS; Active-SoJIA  HS:  = 0.000) in SoJIA compared with HS. By contrast, the abundance of Bacteroidaceae was the highest in the Active-SoJIA group, followed by the Inactive-SoJIA and HS groups (16.% in Active-SoJIA, 12.8% in Inactive-SoJIA, and 9.7% in HS; Active-SoJIA  HS:  = 0.03). The Spearman correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between Proteobacteria or Enterobacteriaceae and juvenile arthritis disease activity score on 27 joints (JADAS-27).The composition of the intestinal  is different in SoJIA patients compared with healthy children.

Among the predominant etiological agents of bovine mastitis are , , and  Currently, the treatment of choice for bovine mastitis involves the use of commercial therapeutic antibiotic formulations such as Terrexine, containing both kanamycin and cephalexin. Such antibiotics are regularly administered in more than one dose resulting in the withholding of milk for processing for a number of days. Here, we describe the optimization of a formulation of  DPC3147, that produces the two-component bacteriocin lacticin 3147, in a liquid paraffin-based emulsion (formulation hereafter designated 'live bio-therapeutic') for the first time and compare it to the commercial antibiotic formulation Terrexine, with a view to treating cows with clinical/sub-clinical mastitis. Critically, in a field trial described here, this 'ready-to-use' emulsion containing live  DPC3147 cells exhibited comparable efficacy to Terrexine when used to treat mastitic cows. Furthermore, we found that the  cells within this novel emulsion-based formulation remained viable for up to  weeks, when stored at 4, 22, or 37°C. The relative ease and cost-effective nature of producing this 'live bio-therapeutic' formulation, in addition to its enhanced shelf life compared to previous aqueous-based formulations, indicate that this product could be a viable alternative therapeutic option for bovine mastitis. Moreover, the single-dose administration of this 'live bio-therapeutic' formulation is a further advantage, as it can expedite the return of the milk to the milk pool, in comparison to some commercial antibiotics. Overall, in this field trial, we show that the live bio-therapeutic formulation displayed a 47% cure rate compared to a 50% cure rate for a commercial antibiotic control, with respect to curing cows with clinical/sub-clinical mastitis. The study suggests that a larger field trial to further demonstrate efficacy is warranted.Copyright © 2019 Kitching, Mathur, Flynn, Byrne, Dillon, Sayers, Rea, Hill and Ross.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614920>Characterization of the Spoilage  of Hake Fillets Packaged Under a Modified Atmosphere (MAP) Rich in CO (50% CO/50% N) and Stored at Different Temperatures.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to characterize the spoilage  of hake fillets stored under modified atmospheres (MAP) (50% CO/50% N) at different temperatures using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and to compare the results with those obtained using traditional microbiology techniques.

Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying  engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and (2) patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut . Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from  individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in  induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut  composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

The yak () is the main livestock species that inhabits the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) at regions located at high-altitude of 3,000-,000 m. This work investigated the rumen bacterial community of yak that grazed on the QTP during the whole year to evaluate the relationship between the rumen bacterial community and the nutrient composition of forage plant at three stages. In this study, the diversity of the rumen prokaryotic community composition was monitored in 10 full-grazing yak in an alpine meadow of the QTP. The nutrient composition of three forage growth stages was determined: re-green stage (REGY), grassy stage (GY), and withered stage (WGY). High-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene was used. The results showed that the nutritive composition of the alpine meadow changed with the seasons: crude protein (CP) (13.22%) was high in forage during REGY (spring), while neutral detergent fiber (NDF) (59.00%) was high during WGY (winter). Microbial diversity and richness were highest during REGY and the average number of operational taxonomic units from 30 samples was 4,470. The microbial composition was dominated by members of Bacteroidetes (51.82%), followed by Firmicutes (34.08%), and the relative microbial abundance changed in the three forage growth stages. Unweighted UniFrac distance PcoA showed that the bacterial community structure differed between REGY, GY, and WGY. Furthermore, taxonomic groups did not present differences regarding gender in these three stages. The rumen  was enriched with functional potentials that were related to ABC transporters, the two-component system, Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and metabolism of Purine, Pyrimidine, Starch and sucrose metabolism. Significant differences were found in the composition, diversity, and function of yak ruminal microorganisms during different forage growth stages. This indicates that microbial changes in the rumen depend on changes in the forage nutritional composition. These findings provide evidence on the rumen microbial diversity of yaks in the QTP.©2019 Ma et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576099>Evaluation and comparison of short chain fatty acids composition in gut diseases.</a></h1><p>An altered (dysbiosis) and unhealthy status of the gut  is usually responsible for a reduction of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentration. SCFAs obtained from the carbohydrate fermentation processes are crucial in maintaining gut homeostasis and their determination in stool samples could provide a faster, reliable and cheaper method to highlight the presence of an intestinal dysbiosis and a biomarker for various gut diseases. We hypothesize that different intestinal diseases, such as celiac disease (CD), adenomatous polyposis (AP) and colorectal cancer (CRC) could display a particular fecal SCFAs' signature.To compare the fecal SCFAs' profiles of CD, AP, CRC patients and healthy controls, using the same analytical method.In this cross-sectional study, we defined and compared the SCFAs' concentration in fecal samples of 9 AP, 16 CD, 19 CRC patients and 16 healthy controls (HC). The SCFAs' analysis were performed using a gas-chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry method. Data analysis was carried out using Wilcoxon rank-sum test to assess pairwise differences of SCFAs' profiles, partial least squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) to determine the status membership based on distinct SCFAs' profiles, and Dirichlet regression to determine factors influencing concentration levels of SCFAs.We have not observed any difference in the SCFAs' amount and composition between CD and healthy control. On the contrary, the total amount of SCFAs was significantly lower in CRC patients compared to HC ( = 0.044) and CD ( = 0.005). Moreover, the SCFAs' percentage composition was different in CRC and AP compared to HC. In detail, HC displayed higher percentage of acetic acid ( value = 1.3 × 10) and a lower amount of butyric ( value = 0.02192), isobutyric ( value = 7.4 × 10), isovaleric ( value = 0.00012) and valeric ( value = 0.00014) acids compared to CRC patients. AP showed a lower abundance of acetic acid ( value = 0.00062) and higher percentages of propionic ( value = 0.00433) and isovaleric ( value = 0.00433) acids compared to HC. Moreover, AP showed higher levels of propionic acid ( value = 0.03251) and a lower level of isobutyric acid ( value = 0.00427) in comparison to CRC. The PLS-DA model demonstrated a significant separation of CRC and AP groups from HC, although some degree of overlap was observed between CRC and AP.Analysis of fecal SCFAs shows the potential to provide a non-invasive means of diagnosis to detect patients with CRC and AP, while CD patients cannot be discriminated from healthy subjects.©The Author(s) 2019.

It generates significant impacts on the quality of life of those affected. The pathophysiology is uncertain, but the role of various food types has been established in bowel sensitivity and its clinical manifestations. Carbohydrate intolerance, particularly to lactose, generates similar and sometimes indistinguishable symptoms from irritable bowel syndrome, and in clinical practice is both a frequent and underdiagnosed condition. Carbohydrate intolerance is related to enzymatic deficiencies, alterations of intestinal  and even genetic change. The principal test for a diagnosis of lactose intolerance is the breath test, which measures hydrogen emission (produced only by bacteria), after ingestion of the corresponding substrate.The present work aims to verify the prevalence of lactose intolerance in university students, presenting gastrointestinal symptoms suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome.In a transversal study, to screen for those with suggestive symptoms, 124 medicine students participated by responding to a form. Those with abdominal pain were referred for anti-parasite treatment in order to exclude intestinal parasites as a secondary cause. Subsequently, using the hydrogen breath test, bacterial overgrowth was investigated, and if negative, lactose intolerance testing would be performed. Patients presenting high hydrogen concentrations of ≥20 ppm above the basal level were considered lactose intolerant.Of the total of students researched (n=124), 7 were excluded because they did not completing all study phases. From those 117 individuals effectively included in the survey; 8 (6.8%) were diagnosed with lactose intolerance and 2 (1.7%) with bacterial overgrowth. Intolerance was more frequent in; female individuals (75%), age range 18 to 25 years (62.%), being colored (50%), and in their 5th semester of studies (37.%). The presence of at least one gastrointestinal symptom among those presenting intolerance (100%), and those not presenting intolerance (42.2%) was found (P=0.002). In addition to abdominal pain (100%) (P<0.001), the most recurrent gastrointestinal symptom in the lactose intolerant students was the distension/flatulence (62.%) (P=0.026). In relation to life habits and food patterns, there was no statistical difference between lactose tolerant and intolerant individuals, or for symptom frequencies. The more advanced students, completing more periods towards graduation, demonstrated more occurrences of gastrointestinal symptoms, yet without presenting significant statistical discrepancies.In view of the test sample quantity (n=21), a high prevalence of lactose intolerance (6.8%) in the academic environment, with epidemiological characteristics compatible to those found the literature is demonstrated, generating knowledge with understanding to prevent, diagnose, alleviate and treat lactose intolerant university students, and generate positive impacts towards well-being, improving the quality of life of these individuals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672750>Draft Genome Sequence of Vibrio cyclitrophicus NCT10V, Cultivated from the  of a Marine Copepod.</a></h1><p>Here, we report the draft genome sequence of  V, cultivated from the copepod , collected from coastal surface waters of the western North Atlantic Ocean.

Gut  diversity and its natural fermentation products are not only correlated with MS and CAD, but their correlations also appear to be stronger than the associations with traditional risk factors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide a new potential pathway for the natural fermentation product butyrate to improve MS and to examine whether it is associated with serum metabolic profiles and gut flora composition.  C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were treated with 400 mg/kg of sodium butyrate for 16 weeks. Blood and fecal samples were collected, and the metabolite concentrations and 16s rRNA were measured with liquid chromatography-MS and Illumina platform, respectively. The plasma differential metabolites and gut  composition were analyzed with XCMS online and QIIME 2, respectively.  Gut -derived butyrate reduced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, resisting HFD-induced increase in the relative abundance of f_, f_, and f_. Meanwhile, sodium butyrate increased the levels of α-linolenate, all-trans-retinal, resolvin E1, and leukotriene in the plasma, and the differential pathways showed enrichment in mainly resolvin E biosynthesis, histidine degradation, lipoxin biosynthesis, and leukotriene biosynthesis. Moreover, sodium butyrate increased the levels of phosphorylated-adenosine '-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) and facilitated glucose transporter member 4 (GLUT4) in the adipose tissue.  Butyrate can induce AMPK activation and GLUT4 expression in the adipose tissue, improving cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related metabolic disorder, resisting HFD-induced gut  dysbiosis, and promoting resolvin E1 and lipoxin biosynthesis.

We found that the prebiotic shifts the intestinal  profile; alpha diversity was significantly reduced with 2.% AlgOS while with 0.% AlgOS the alteration occurred without impacting the bacterial diversity. Beta diversity analysis indicated the significant differences between control and prebiotic-fed groups. The low supplementation level of AlgOS facilitated the dominance of Proteobacteria (including , , ), and Spirochaetes () in the content or mucus of the fish, and few of these bacteria (, ) have genes associated with butyrate production. The results indicate that the low inclusion of AlgOS can plausibly induce a prebiotic effect on the distal intestinal  of Atlantic salmon. These findings can generate further interest in the potential of macroalgae-derived oligosaccharides for food and feed applications.Copyright © 2019 Gupta, Lokesh, Abdelhafiz, Siriyappagouder, Pierre, Sørensen, Fernandes and Kiron.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674687>Modulations of Probiotics on Gut  in a -Fluorouracil-Induced Mouse Model of Mucositis.</a></h1><p>Intestinal mucositis remained one of the most deleterious complications in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. -FU treatment was reported to affect the abundance of gut  and cause mucositis, which might be ameliorated by probiotics.

WGS suggested interspecies transfer as the predominant mechanism rather than independent acquisition in 80% (8/10; one none-recoverable isolate) of patients with multiple CRE but not in CRNF-CRE combinations. 20% (30/158) of the in-patients had underlying hematological malignancies, they are more likely to exhibit multiple CRGNB (OR=3.0, 95% CI=0.98-8.89, p=0.05) and CRE (OR=3.9, 95% CI=1.02-14.58, p=0.04) strains during hospital stay compared to other patient groups.Our data give insight into the occurrence of natural in vivo HGT in a clinical setting.. Better understanding of HGT will help optimizing containment measures and may guide antibiotic stewardship programs.Copyright © 2019.

Beta-glucan or quercetin in a diet can alleviate colorectal cancer (CRC) by regulating the gut  and related genes, but the effects of alternating their consumption for routine ingestion during CRC occurrence remain unknown. This study investigated the effects of alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin for routine ingestion on CRC development in mice. The mortality rate, colonic length, inflammatory cytokines, gut , and colonic epithelial gene expression in healthy and CRC mice that consumed normal and alternate diets were compared and studied. The results showed that alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin (alternating among a β-glucan diet, a normal diet and a normal diet that was supplemented with quercetin) alleviated colon damage and reduced the mortality rate in CRC mice, with a reduction in mortality of 12.%. Alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin significantly decreased the TNF-α level, increased the relative abundance of  and downregulated three genes ( and ) that are associated with inflammation and cancer. Alternating the consumption of some bioactive compounds, such as β-glucan and quercetin, in food can contribute to human health. This experiment provided some experimental evidence for the dietary recommendations for disease prevention and management.© 2019 The Authors.

However, it remains unclear whether there is any association between the JD and fecal  composition. This cross-sectional study examined the relationship between JD scores and fecal  in young Japanese adults, through the analysis of fecal  using the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) method. JD scores were calculated with regard to nine food groups (rice, miso soup, pickles, green and yellow vegetables, seaweeds, fish, green tea, meat, and coffee) based on a brief self-administered diet-history questionnaire. JD total scores were categorized as low (score 0-3) or high (score 4-8). The high-scoring JD group exhibited a significantly higher relative abundance of Bacteroides than the low JD group, whereas the low JD group exhibited a significantly higher relative abundance of Prevotella than the high JD group. With regard to food group intakes, a higher consumption of rice was associated with a significantly lower relative abundance of Prevotella, whereas a higher consumption of green tea was associated with a significantly higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating an association between JD score and fecal  and may allow the prediction of changes in fecal  due to changes in the JD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674054>Long-term impact of tylosin on fecal  and fecal bile acids of healthy dogs.</a></h1><p>Tylosin is commonly prescribed to dogs with diarrhea.

After inclusion around gestational week 16-18, participants are followed-up with data collection points around gestational week 32, at childbirth, as well as three times postpartum: after 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year. At the last follow-up, 70.8% still remain in the cohort.In addition to internet-based surveys with self-report instruments, participants contribute with biological samples, for example, blood samples (maternal and from umbilical cord), biopsies (umbilical cord and placenta) and  samples. A nested case-control subsample also takes part in cognitive and emotional tests, heart rate variability tests and bioimpedance tests. Subprojects have identified various correlates of PND of psychological and obstetric origin in addition to factors of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and immune system.In parallel with the completion of data collection (final follow-up November 2019), BASIC study data are currently analysed in multiple subprojects.

The relative abundance of Christensenellaceae in the human gut is inversely related to host body mass index (BMI) in different populations and multiple studies, making its relationship with BMI the most robust and reproducible link between the microbial ecology of the human gut and metabolic disease reported to date. The family is also related to a healthy status in a number of other different disease contexts, including obesity and inflammatory bowel disease.

Exosomes are released into the extracellular medium by several cell types and are excellent carriers of biomolecules. Host-derived exosomes and the transport of pathogen-derived molecules by exosomes impact infections in different ways. The interactions of exosomes with the maternal immune system are pivotal to a favorable gestational outcome. In this review, we highlight the potential role of exosomes in the establishment of an adequate milieu that enables embryo implantation and discuss the participation of exosomes released at the maternal-fetal interface during the establishment of an immune-privileged compartment for fetal development. The placenta is a component where important strategies are used to minimize the risk of infection. To present a contrast, we also discuss possible mechanisms used by pathogens to cross the maternal-fetal interface. We review the processes, mechanisms, and potential consequences of dysregulation in all of the abovementioned phenomena. Basic information about exosomes and their roles in viral immune evasion is also presented. The interactions between extracellular vesicles and bacteria, fungi, parasites and proteinaceous infectious agents are addressed. The discovery of the placental  and the implications of this new  are also discussed, and current proposals that explain fetal/placental colonization by both pathogenic and commensal microbes are addressed. The comprehension of such interactions will help us to understand the immune dynamics of human pregnancy and the mechanisms of immune evasion used by different pathogens.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566173>Partially defatted olive cake in finishing pig diets: implications on performance, faecal , carcass quality, slurry composition and gas emission.</a></h1><p>One of the key factors to improve swine production sustainability is the use of agro-industrial by-products in feeds, such as olive by-products. However, it is necessary to assess its effects on the overall production process, including the animal and the environment. With this aim, an experiment was conducted to determine the effects of including a partially defatted olive cake (PDOC) in pig diets on growth performance, faecal , carcass quality and gas emission from the slurry. Two finishing diets were formulated, a control (C) diet and a diet with PDOC included at 120 g/kg. Eighty finishing male pigs Duroc-Danbred × (Landrace × Large White) of 60.4 ± 7.00 kg BW were divided between these two treatments. During the finishing period (60 to 110 kg BW, 55 days) average daily gain, average daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio were recorded. Faecal samples from the rectum of 16 animals per treatment were incubated for bacteria enumeration. At the end of finishing period, backfat thickness and loin depth (LD) were measured. Animals were slaughtered to obtain carcass weight and carcass composition parameters, and subcutaneous fat was sampled to analyse the fatty acid (FA) profile. In addition greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions were measured during pig slurry storage using the methodology of dynamic flux chambers. An initial slurry characterisation and biochemical methane potential (B0) were also determined. No significant differences between treatments were found in performance, carcass quality and microbial counts with the exception of LD, which was lower in PDOC compared with C animals (45. v. 47. mm, SEM: 0.62; P = 0.020). The FA profile of the subcutaneous fat did not differ between treatments, but the monounsaturated FA (MUFA) concentration was higher and the polyunsaturated FA was lower in the animals fed PDOC (50.9 v. 48.3, SEM: 0.48, P < 0.001; 17.6 v. 19.3, SEM: 0.30, P < 0.001 in mg/100 g of Total FA, for PDOC and C animals, respectively). The initial pig slurry characterisation only showed differences in ADF concentration that was higher (P < 0.05) in the slurry from PDOC treatment. Regarding gas emission, slurries from both treatments emitted similar amounts of ammonia (NH3), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as B0 values. The results obtained suggest that PDOC may be included in balanced pig diets at rates of up to 120 g/kg without negative effects on performance, carcass quality, gut microflora and slurry gas emission, while improving the MUFA concentration of subcutaneous fat.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583115>Utilizing genome-scale models to optimize nutrient supply for sustained algal growth and lipid productivity.</a></h1><p>Nutrient availability is critical for growth of algae and other microbes used for generating valuable biochemical products. Determining the optimal levels of nutrient supplies to cultures can eliminate feeding of excess nutrients, lowering production costs and reducing nutrient pollution into the environment. With the advent of omics and bioinformatics methods, it is now possible to construct genome-scale models that accurately describe the metabolism of microorganisms. In this study, a genome-scale model of the green alga  (CZ946) was applied to predict feeding of multiple nutrients, including nitrate and glucose, under both autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions. The objective function was changed from optimizing growth to instead minimizing nitrate and glucose uptake rates, enabling predictions of feed rates for these nutrients. The metabolic model control (MMC) algorithm was validated for autotrophic growth, saving 18% nitrate while sustaining algal growth. Additionally, we obtained similar growth profiles by simultaneously controlling glucose and nitrate supplies under heterotrophic conditions for both high and low levels of glucose and nitrate. Finally, the nitrate supply was controlled in order to retain protein and chlorophyll synthesis, albeit at a lower rate, under nitrogen-limiting conditions. This model-driven cultivation strategy doubled the total volumetric yield of biomass, increased fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield by 61%, and enhanced lutein yield nearly 3 fold compared to nitrogen starvation. This study introduces a control methodology that integrates omics data and genome-scale models in order to optimize nutrient supplies based on the metabolic state of algal cells in different nutrient environments. This approach could transform bioprocessing control into a systems biology-based paradigm suitable for a wide range of species in order to limit nutrient inputs, reduce processing costs, and optimize biomanufacturing for the next generation of desirable biotechnology products.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600703>Antibiotic resistance and  in the gut of Chinese four major freshwater carp from retail markets.</a></h1><p>Fish-associated antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have attracted increasing attention due to their potential risks to human beings via the food chain. However, data are scarce regarding the antibiotic resistance in fish themselves. Herein, the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were assessed in the gut of four major Chinese freshwater carp (i.e., silver carp, grass carp, bighead carp, and crucian carp) from food retail markets. Results show that the abundances of target ARGs (e.g., tetA, tetO, tetQ, tetW, sulI, sulII, and bla) and class 1 integrase (intI1) were in the range 9.4 × 10 - 1.6 × 10 and 6.7 × 10 - .2 × 10 gene copies per 16S rRNA gene, respectively. The sulI, sulII, and tetQ strongly correlated with silver and mercury resistance genes (e.g., silE and merR). The microbial taxa of fish gut could be partly separated among retail markets based on the PCA analysis. About 15.0% of the OTUs in fish gut were shared and 74.% of the shared OTUs were identified as Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. These phyla may constitute the core  in the guts of the four Chinese freshwater carp. The possible ARG hosts were revealed based on the network analysis, and the presence of pathogen-associated resistant genera in fish gut highlights the need to fully understand their potential human health risks.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We compared the intestinal fermentative capability of stunted and nonstunted ('healthy') children in southern India using two types of RS: high amylose maize starch (HAMS) and acetylated HAMS (HAMSA). Twenty children (10 stunted and 10 healthy) aged 2 to  years were fed biscuits containing HAMS (10 g/day) for two weeks followed by a 2-week washout and then HAMSA biscuits (10 g/day) for 2 weeks. Fecal samples were collected at 3-4 day intervals and pH and SCFA analyzed. At entry, stunted children had lower SCFA concentrations compared to healthy children. Both types of RS led to a significant decrease in fecal pH and increase in fecal acetate and propionate in both healthy and stunted children. However, while HAMS increased fecal butyrate in both groups of children, HAMSA increased butyrate in healthy but not stunted children. Furthermore, healthy children showed a significantly greater increase than stunted children in both acetate and butyrate when fed either RS. No adverse effects were reported with either RS. Stunted children have impaired capacity to ferment certain types of RS which has implications for choice of RS in formulations aimed at improving microbial function in stunted children.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655448>Waxing and cultivar affect Salmonella enterica persistence on cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) fruit.</a></h1><p>A dearth of knowledge exists on the pathogen-commodity association of Salmonella enterica on cucumber, despite cucumbers being implicated in multiple salmonellosis outbreaks in recent years in the U.S. Data are lacking on cultivar susceptibility to Salmonella colonization in relation to heterogeneity in fruit surface morphology. Further, fruit waxing is a common practice in wholesale cucumber to preserve the water content of fruit and prolong shelf-life, but its impact on epiphytic  is not well studied. This study investigated the survival of Salmonella Newport and S. Javiana on the surface of six cucumber cultivars of varying surface morphology and the effect of fruit waxing on the persistence of S. Newport. S. Newport and S. Javiana were spot inoculated onto fruit of cultivars 'Marketmore 97', 'Patio Snacker' and 'Corinto' (varieties with trichomes or spines), and 'Bella', 'Pepinex' and 'Summer Dance' (glabrous or smooth varieties). Cucumbers were held at room temperature for 24 h before inoculated sections of exocarp were excised for enteropathogen enumeration. S. Javiana persisted at higher populations than S. Newport (1.0 and 1. log CFU g exocarp decline, respectively) after 24 h (P < 0.05). Fruit waxing lessened S. Newport population decline after 24 h on all cultivars tested (P < 0.01). While there was a ~2 log CFU g exocarp decline in populations on unwaxed cucumbers, the reduction on waxed cucumbers was ~1 log CFU g exocarp. A cultivar effect was also observed; 'Summer Dance' supported consistently higher and 'Corinto' and 'Marketmore 97' (though for S. Javiana only) consistently lower Salmonella levels. Cultivars with trichomes were associated with lower populations than glabrous cultivars (P < 0.05). Our data showed that Salmonella persistence on fruit differed for the two serotypes tested and that cultivar differences play a role in determining cucumber surface favourability for pathogen colonization. Additionally, fruit waxing may elevate the risk of Salmonella persistence on cucumber.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance and Insulin Resistance Study (ORIGINS) enrolled 230 diabetes-free adults (77% female) aged 20 to 55 y (mean ± SD, 34 ± 10 y) from whom baseline subgingival plaque and longitudinal FPG were measured. DNA was extracted from subgingival plaque, and V3 to V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced. FPG was measured at baseline and again at 2 y; glucose change was defined as follow-up minus baseline. Multivariable linear models regressed 2-y glucose change onto baseline measures of community diversity and abundances of 369 individual taxa. A microbial dysbiosis index (MDI) summarizing top individual taxa associated with glucose change was calculated and used in regression models. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking status, body mass index, and baseline glucose levels. Statistical significance was based on the false discovery rate (FDR; <0.05) or a Bonferroni-corrected  value of 1 × 10, derived from the initial 369 hypothesis tests for specific taxa. Mean 2-y FPG change was 1. ± 8 mg/dL. Baseline levels of 9 taxa predicted FPG change (all FDR <0.05), among which  sp oral taxon 097 and  spp predicted greater FPG change, while  sp oral taxon 498 predicted lesser FPG change (all 3  values, Bonferroni significant). The MDI explained 6% of variation in longitudinal glucose change ( < 0.001), and baseline glucose levels explained 10% of variation ( < 0.0001).

Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity, especially in the kidneys, is an important mechanism linking obesity to hypertension. Some adipokines play important roles in elevating blood pressure (BP). Hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance stimulates sodium reabsorption, enhances sodium retention, and increases circulating plasma volume. Hyperinsulinemia also stimulates both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the SNS, resulting in the acceleration of atherosclerosis through the hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells, which contributes to increased peripheral vascular resistance. Obesity is associated with increased RAAS activity despite volume overload, as the tissue RAASs are stimulated in obese hypertensive individuals. Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated hypertension must also be considered in obese patients with resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Some components of the gut  contribute to BP control; therefore, gut dysbiosis caused by obesity might lead to increased BP. The ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat is higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, which may explain why Japanese patients are more susceptible to metabolic disorders even though they are less obese than Caucasian individuals. Obesity-associated kidney dysfunction directly increases BP, leading to further deterioration of kidney function. A bodyweight reduction of more than 3% or  kg significantly lowers BP. Gastrointestinal bypass surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and its related metabolic disorders, including hypertension. Because both obesity and hypertension are representative lifestyle-related disorders, lifestyle modification, especially to improve obesity, should be performed first as a treatment for hypertension.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572329>Dramatic Remodeling of the Gut  Around Parturition and Its Relationship With Host Serum Metabolic Changes in Sows.</a></h1><p>Perinatal care is important in mammals due to its contribution to fetal growth, maternal health, and lactation. Substantial changes in host hormones, metabolism, and immunity around the parturition period may be accompanied by alterations in the gut . However, to our knowledge, changes in the gut  and their contribution to the shifts in host metabolism around parturition have not been investigated in pigs. Furthermore, pigs are an ideal biomedical model for studying the interactions of the gut  with host metabolism, due to the ease of controlling feeding conditions. Here we report dramatic remodeling of the gut  and the potential functional capacity during the late stages of pregnancy ( days before parturition, LP) to postpartum (within 6 h after delivery, PO) in both experimental and validated populations of sows ( = 107). The richness of bacteria in the gut of both pregnant and delivery sows significantly decreased, whilst the β-diversity dramatically expanded. The ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes, and the relative abundance of Prevotella significantly decreased, whilst the relative abundance of the predominant genus  significantly increased from LP to PO state. The predicted functional capacities of the gut  related to amino acid metabolism, the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, and glycan biosynthesis were significantly decreased from LP to PO state. However, the abundance of the functional capacities associated with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were increased. Consistent with these changes, serum metabolites enriched at the LP stage were associated with the metabolism of amino acids and vitamins. In contrast, metabolites enriched at the PO stage were related to lipid metabolism. We further identified that the richness and β-diversity of the gut  and the abundance of  accounted for shifts in the levels of bile acid metabolites associated with lipid metabolism. The results suggest that host- interactions during the perinatal period impact host metabolism. These benefit the lactation of sows by providing energy from lipid metabolism for milk production.Copyright © 2019 Huang, Gao, Zhao, He, Ke, Wu, Zhou, Fu, Yang, Chen and Huang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662431>Interrogation of Internal Workings in Microbial Community Assembly: Play a Game through a Behavioral Network?</a></h1><p>Increasing evidence shows that the influence of  on biogeochemical cycling, plant development, and human health is executed through a complex network of microbe-microbe interactions. However, characterizing how microbes interact and work together within closely packed and highly heterogeneous microbial ecosystems is extremely challenging. Here, we describe a rule-of-thumb framework for visualizing polymicrobial interactions and extracting general principles that underlie microbial communities. We integrate elements of metabolic ecology, behavioral ecology, and game theory to quantify the interactive strategies by which microbes at any taxonomic level compete for resources and cooperate symbiotically with each other to form and stabilize ecological communities. We show how the framework can chart an omnidirectional landscape of microbial cooperation and competition that may drive various natural processes. This framework can be implemented into genome-wide association studies to unravel the genetic mechanisms underlying microbial interaction networks and their evolutionary consequences along spatiotemporal gradients. Identifying general biological rules that underlie the complexity and heterogeneity of microbial communities has proven to be highly challenging. We present a rule-of-thumb framework for studying and characterizing how microbes interact with each other across different taxa to determine community behavior and dynamics. This framework is computationally simple but conceptually meaningful, and it can provide a starting point to generate novel biological hypotheses about microbial interactions and explore internal workings of microbial community assembly in depth.Copyright © 2019 Wang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616428>Immunopathogenesis of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Related Adverse Events: Roles of the Intestinal  and Th17 Cells.</a></h1><p>The advent of novel, innovative, and effective anti-cancer immunotherapies has engendered an era of renewed optimism among cancer specialists and their patients. Foremost among these successful immunotherapies are monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which target immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) molecules, most prominently cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and its major ligand, PD-L1. These immunotherapeutic agents are, however, often associated with the occurrence of immune-mediated toxicities known as immune-related adverse events (IRAEs). The incidence of severe toxicities increases substantially when these agents are used together, particularly with CTLA-4 in combination with PD-1 or PD-L1 antagonists. Accordingly, dissociating the beneficial anti-tumor therapeutic activity of these agents from the emergence of IRAEs represents a significant challenge to attaining the optimum efficacy of ICI-targeted immunotherapy of cancer. This situation is compounded by an increasing awareness, possibly unsurprising, that both the beneficial and harmful effects of ICI-targeted therapies appear to result from an over-reactive immune system. Nevertheless, this challenge may not be insurmountable. This contention is based on acquisition of recent insights into the role of the gut  and its products as determinants of the efficacy of ICI-targeted immunotherapy, as well as an increasing realization of the enigmatic involvement of Th17 cells in both anti-tumor activity and the pathogenesis of some types of IRAEs. Evidence linking the beneficial and harmful activities of ICI-targeted immunotherapy, recent mechanistic insights focusing on the gut  and Th17 cells, as well as strategies to attenuate IRAEs in the setting of retention of therapeutic activity, therefore represent the major thrusts of this review.Copyright © 2019 Anderson, Theron and Rapoport.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583110>Trophic networks improve the performance of microbial anodes treating wastewater.</a></h1><p>Microbial anodes represent a distinct ecological niche that is characterized mainly by the terminal electron acceptor, i.e., the anode potential, and the substrate, i.e., the electron source. Here, we determine the performance and the biofilm community of anode microbiomes while using substrates of increasing complexity (organic acids or organic acids and sugar or real domestic wastewater) to mimic different, practically relevant, trophic levels. α-Diversity values increased with substrate complexity. In addition, the higher abundance value of  in the biofilms corresponds to higher reactor performance (i.e., COD removal, current density, and Coulombic efficiency). In reactors exploiting real wastewater, the diversity of the planktonic microorganisms was only little affected.  network analysis revealed two important clusters for reactor performance as well as performance-independent pathogen-containing clusters. Interestingly,  was not found to be integrated in the network underlining its outstanding individual ecological role in line with its importance for the efficiency of the electron harvest for all reactors. The  analysis of different trophic levels and their temporal development from initial colonization to stable treatment demonstrate important principles for the implementation of microbial anodes for wastewater treatment.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662430>Metabolic Modeling of Streptococcus mutans Reveals Complex Nutrient Requirements of an Oral Pathogen.</a></h1><p> is a Gram-positive bacterium that thrives under acidic conditions and is a primary cause of tooth decay (dental caries). To better understand the metabolism of  on a systematic level, we manually constructed a genome-scale metabolic model of the  type strain UA159. The model, called iSMU, contains 675 reactions involving 429 metabolites and the products of 493 genes. We validated iSMU by comparing simulations with growth experiments in defined medium. The model simulations matched experimental results for 17 of 18 carbon source utilization assays and 47 of 49 nutrient depletion assays. We also simulated the effects of single gene deletions. The model's predictions agreed with 78.1% and 84.4% of the gene essentiality predictions from two experimental data sets. Our manually curated model is more accurate than  models generated from automated reconstruction pipelines and more complete than other manually curated models. We used iSMU to generate hypotheses about the  metabolic network. Subsequent genetic experiments confirmed that (i)  catabolizes sorbitol via a sorbitol-6-phosphate 2-dehydrogenase (SMU_308) and (ii) the Leloir pathway is required for growth on complex carbohydrates such as raffinose. We believe the iSMU model is an important resource for understanding the metabolism of  and guiding future experiments. Tooth decay is the most prevalent chronic disease in the United States. Decay is caused by the bacterium , an oral pathogen that ferments sugars into tooth-destroying lactic acid. We constructed a complete metabolic model of  to systematically investigate how the bacterium grows.

Interventions with prebiotics, the key modulators of the gut , have paramount impact on host-associated metabolic disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of fungus-derived (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a highly soluble dietary fiber, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic distress.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with different diet groups (n = 11): control diet, HFD, 3 g/kg or  g/kg of β-glucan-incorporated HFD. At the end of experimental study period (12th week), body weight, feces weight and fecal moisture content were observed. Further, colonic motility was measured using activated charcoal meal study. Proteins extracted from liver and intestine tissues were subjected to western blot technique. Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal  analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti-obesity property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness). Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly obesity-associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced metabolic distress. Further comprehensive research has to be conducted to brace its clinical relevance, reproducibility and efficacy for aiding human health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601034>Adalimumab Therapy Improves Intestinal Dysbiosis in Crohn's Disease.</a></h1><p>The response to treatment with biologic drugs, in patients with Crohn's disease, could be associated with changes in gut  composition.

We performed a prospective study in patients with Crohn's disease analysing gut  before start of adalimumab therapy (T0) and after six months of therapy (T1). Among the 20 included patients, the phylum  fell from 15.7 ± 3.% at T0 to 10.3 ± 3.4% at T1 ( = 0.038). Furthermore, the trend in relation to therapeutic success was analysed. Regarding bacterial phyla,  decreased in patients in whom therapeutic success was obtained, passing from a value of 15.8% (± 4.6%) to 6.8 ± 3.1% ( = 0.049), while in non-responder patients, percentages did not change (T0 = 15.6 ± .7%, T1 = 16.8 ± 7.6%,  = 0.890). Regarding the  family, in patients with normalization of C reactive protein six 6 months of adalimumab therapy, it increased from 16.6 ± 3.1% at T0 to 23.9 ± 2.6% at T1 ( = 0.049).

We developed a field-to-lab DNA extraction procedure that starts in the vineyard, disrupts the grape berry surface while en route to the lab through agitation, and efficiently extracts microbial DNA from the surface of the grape. It is cost effective and utilizes commonly available laboratory chemicals with low toxicity (Table 1).

We studied the effects of Cd exposure on intestinal histology and  in P. clarkii. The results demonstrated that exposure to Cd caused histological alterations in the intestines of P. clarkii. Meanwhile, high-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that Cd exposure could alter the richness, diversity, and composition of intestinal  in P. clarkii. At the phylum level, the relative abundances of the prevalent phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria changed significantly after exposure to Cd. At the genus level, the most prevalent genera with significant difference in relative abundance were Bacteroides, Clostridium XlVb, Hafnia, Buttiauxella, Shewanella, Anaerorhabdus, Alistipes, Arcobacter, Azoarcus, Chryseobacterium, and so on. Furthermore, functional prediction analysis of intestinal microbial communities showed that Cd exposure could significantly alter the pathways related to metabolism, diseases, cellular processes, and so on. Taken together, exposure to Cd could induce intestinal histological damage and affect intestinal  composition and functions of P. clarkii.

We analyzed the contribution of gluten on obesity and the effects of prebiotics -arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides (AXOS) and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS)- that can be extracted from gluten-containing cereals.Mice were fed a control diet, Western diet (WD, consisting of high fat/high sucrose), or WD with % gluten. Prebiotics were tested in the WD with gluten. Gluten did not increase body weight or intestinal permeability and had a minor effect on ileal inflammation. Gluten decreased the expression of browning markers in the fat, and increased the triglycerides synthesis in the muscle. AXOS decreased body weight and adiposity in fat pads muscle and liver compared to the WD plus gluten. AXOS promoted gluten cleavage by the induction of prolyl endopeptidase that was translated into a reduction of gluten immunogenic peptides. Gluten had minor effects on cecal  composition, whereas prebiotics increased Bifidobacterium, Butyricicoccus, Prevotella and Parasutterella, all negatively correlated to the cecal content of gluten peptides.While gluten may affect metabolic homeostasis, these effects are lessened when gluten is consumed along with cereal-derived fibers. If confirmed in humans, we bring new arguments to eat fiber-rich cereals to promote a healthy diet. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.This article is protected by copyright.

Optimal management relies upon thorough clinical assessment and documentation at each visit.The primary aim of this study was to validate the Oral Disease Severity Score (ODSS) for the assessment of oral involvement in MMP. We also compared its inter- and intra-observer reliability with the oral parts of the Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid Disease Area Index (MMPDAI), Autoimmune Bullous Skin Disorder Intensity Score (ABSIS) and Physician's Global Assessment (PGA).Fifteen patients with mild to moderately severe oral MMP were scored for disease severity by 10 oral medicine clinicians from four UK centres using the ODSS, the oral sections of MMPDAI and ABSIS and PGA. Two clinicians re-scored all patients after two-hours.Inter-observer reliability for ODSS total score intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.97; MMPDAI activity 0.59 and damage 0.15; ABSIS total 0.84; and PGA 0.72. Intra-observer ICC for ODSS total was 0.97 and 0.93; MMPDAI activity 0.93 and 0.70 and damage 0.93 and 0.79; ABSIS total 0.99 and 0.94; and PGA 0.92 and 0.94.

Five samples of commercial spelt flour were subjected to spontaneous fermentation to obtain a type I sourdough. A total of 186 LAB and 174 yeast isolates were selected at different refreshment steps and subjected to further analyses. Within LAB, coccal isolates constituted 78.% of the total LAB, with the dominance of Pediococcus pentosaceus. Although documented before as a component, this is the first report of a spelt sourdough fermentation dominated by this homofermentative LAB, characterized by a high acidification rate, ability to utilize a wide range of carbon sources and to grow in high osmolarity conditions. Yeast communities resulted in four dominant species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Wickerhamomyces anomalus, Pichia fermentans and Clavispora lusitaniae. This study highlights for the first time the biodiversity and dynamics of yeast communities involved in sourdough fermentation of spelt. Compared to commercial baker's yeast, autochthonous W. anomalus, P. fermentans and S. cerevisiae isolates show a good performance, and their use could be an advantage for their acquired adaptation to the environment, providing stability to the fermentation process.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633480> sp. nov.,  sp. nov. and  subsp.  subsp. nov., isolated from human faeces, and creation of  subsp.  subsp. nov.</a></h1><p>Three groups of Gram-stain-negative, obligately anaerobic, rod or coccoid-shaped bacteria, which were phylogenetically assigned in the genus  belonging to the family  in the phylum , were isolated from the faecal samples of healthy Japanese humans.

Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut  is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

Humans are both endogenously and exogenously exposed to acrolein. Long-term exposure to acrolein leads to various chronic diseases. Dietary polyphenols have been reported to be able to attenuate acrolein-induced toxicity in vitro via formation of acrolein-polyphenol conjugates. However, whether in vitro acrolein-trapping abilities of polyphenols can be maintained under in vivo environments is still unknown.Two most commonly consumed dietary polyphenols, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) from tea and genistein from soy, were used to evaluate for their anti-acrolein behaviors both in vitro and in mice. Tea EGCG exerted much higher capacity to capture acrolein than soy genistein in vitro. But translation of in vitro anti-acrolein activity into in vivo was mainly mediated by bioavailability and biotransformation of individual polyphenols. We found that 1) both absorbed EGCG and genistein could trap endogenous ACR by forming mono-ACR adducts and eventually be excreted into mouse urine; 2) both absorbed EGCG and genistein could produce active metabolites, MeEGCG and orobol, to scavenge endogenous ACR; 3) both MeEGCG and non-absorbed EGCG showed ability to trap ACR in the gut; 4) considerable amounts of microbial metabolites of genistein displayed enhanced anti-ACR capacity both in the body and in the gut, compared to genistein; and ) biotransformation of genistein is able to boost its in vivo anti-ACR capacity, compared to EGCG.Our findings demonstrate that in vivo anti-acrolein ability of dietary polyphenols cannot be reflected solely based on their in vitro ability. The bioavailability and biotransformation of individual polyphenols especially gut  contribute to in vivo anti-acrolein ability of dietary polyphenols. This article is protected by copyright.

Pregnancy outcomes defined as first or second trimester miscarriage, or uncomplicated term delivery.First trimester miscarriage associated with reduced prevalence of Lactobacillus spp.-dominated vaginal  classified using hierarchical clustering analysis (65.6 versus 87.7%; P = 0.005), higher alpha diversity (mean Inverse Simpson Index 2. [95% confidence interval 1.8-3.0] versus 1. [1.3-1.7], P = 0.003) and higher richness 25.1 (18.-31.7) versus 16.7 (13.4-20), P = 0.017), compared with viable pregnancies. This was independent of vaginal bleeding and observable before first trimester miscarriage diagnosis (P = 0.015). Incomplete/complete miscarriage associated with higher proportions of Lactobacillus spp.-depleted communities compared with missed miscarriage. Early pregnancy vaginal bacterial stability was similar between miscarriage and term pregnancies.These findings associate the bacterial component of vaginal  with first trimester miscarriage and indicate suboptimal community composition is established in early pregnancy. While further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism, vaginal bacterial composition may represent a modifiable risk factor for first trimester miscarriage.Vaginal bacterial composition in first trimester miscarriage is associated with reduced Lactobacillus spp. abundance and is independent of vaginal bleeding.© 2019 The Authors.

Six multiparous lactating Holstein cows were used in a crossover design (two treatments × two periods). The control treatment (CON) was based on a diet including 50% of grass silage, whereas the experimental treatment (TAN) included grass silage sprayed with OTE (26 g/kg DM) just before baling. Milk yield (on average 24 kg fat protein corrected milk per day) was not affected, but both milk and rumen fatty acids profiles were impacted by OTE. Nitrogen intake (415 g N per cow per day) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE; 0.25 on average) were not affected, but a shift from urine (-8% of N intake relatively to control, P = 0.06) to faecal N (+%; P = 0.004) was observed with the TAN diet (P ≤ 0.05). Nitrogen apparent digestibility was thus reduced for TAN (-3%; P ≤ 0.05). The effect of OTE on ruminal and milk FA profiles suggests an impact on rumen . Nitrogen isotopic discrimination between animal proteins and diet (Δ15N) was evaluated as a proxy for NUE. While no differences in NUE were observed across diets, a lower Δ15N of plasma proteins was found when comparing TAN v. CON diets. This finding supports the concept that Δ15N would mainly sign the N partitioning at the metabolic level rather than the overall NUE, with the latter also being impacted by digestive processes. Our results agree with a N shift from urine to faeces, and this strategy can thus be adopted to decrease the environmental impact of ruminant protein feeding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641822>HS-SPME-GC-MS approach for the analysis of volatile salivary metabolites and application in a case study for the indirect assessment of gut .</a></h1><p>In this work, a straightforward analytical approach based on headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was developed for the analysis of salivary volatile organic compounds without any prior derivatization step. With a sample volume of 500 μL, optimal conditions were achieved by allowing the sample to equilibrate for 10 min at 50 °C and then extracting the samples for 10 min at the same temperature, using a carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane fibre. The method allowed the simultaneous identification and quantification of 20 compounds in sample headspace, including short-chain fatty acids and their derivatives which are commonly analysed after analyte derivatization. The proof of applicability of the methodology was performed with a case study regarding the analysis of the dynamics of volatile metabolites in saliva of a single subject undergoing -day treatment with rifaximin antibiotic. Non-stimulated saliva samples were collected over 3 weeks from a nominally healthy volunteer before, during, and after antibiotic treatment. The variations of some metabolites, known to be produced by the  and by bacteria that are susceptible to antibiotics, suggest that the study of the dynamics of salivary metabolites can be an excellent indirect method for analysing the gut . This approach is novel from an analytical standpoint, and it encourages further studies combining saliva metabolite profiles and gut  dynamics.
