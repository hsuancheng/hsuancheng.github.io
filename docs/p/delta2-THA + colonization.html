We evaluated the effect of the maternal diet during pregnancy and during the first month of lactation on the human milk microbiota in a cross-sectional study including 94 healthy lactating women. Microbiota composition was determined by 16S rDNA profiling and nutrient intake assessed through food questionnaires. Thirteen genera were present in at least 90% of all samples, with three genera present in all samples: , , and . Cluster analysis indicated two distinct compositions: one marked by a high abundance of  (cluster 1), and other by a high abundance of  (cluster 2). A global association with milk microbiota diversity was observed for vitamin C intake during pregnancy ( = 0.029), which was higher for cluster 2 individuals (cluster 2 median = 232 mg/d; cluster 1 = 175 mg/d;  = 0.02). Positive correlations were found between  in the milk and intake of polyunsaturated and linoleic fatty acids during the lactation period ( < 0.01). We show that maternal diet influences the human milk microbiota, especially during pregnancy, which may contribute in shaping the gut microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626718>Group B Streptococcus serotypes Ia and V induce differential vaginal immune responses that may contribute to long term  of the female reproductive tract.</a></h2><p>Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a common colonizer of the female genital tract at the time of pregnancy, and has been associated with severe neonatal infections. Despite trials for GBS vaccines already being underway, the factors influencing vaginal GBS  and clearance are currently poorly understood.Within this study, we investigated the host immune responses to GBS infections in mice that affect GBS vaginal  and clearance. Cervicovaginal swabs were used to measure vaginal GBS persistence, and vaginal cytokine responses were measured using the Bio-Plex® system. Lymphocytes isolated from spleens were stimulated with UV-killed GBS to examine systemic cellular responses. Additional in vitro cellular experiments using human vaginal epithelial cells were also performed, examining the effect pregnancy level hormones had on GBS adhesion, invasion and cytokine responses.We observed significant differences in the ability of GBS serotype V infections to persist, compared to GBS serotype Ia vaginal infections. Vaginal cytokine response examination identified temporal changes in cytokine production (IL10, IFNγ, IL6, IL1β, TNFα) in relation to GBS serotype and clearance or . Lymphocyte proliferation assays also revealed robust cellular immune responses to GBS vaginal infections irrespective of clearance or . In vitro human cellular analyses also identified that vaginal epithelial cell line cytokine production was suppressed in the presence of hormones despite no alteration in adhesion/invasion.Here, we establish previously unknown, serotype specific, temporal immune responses which may be associated with vaginal GBS  or clearance in the female genital tract.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In view of this, the present study was initiated to understand the interaction effect of native Glomerales species application in rice plants (cv. Naveen) under elevated CO concentrations (400 ± 10, 550 ± 20, and 700 ± 20 ppm) in open-top chambers. Three different modes of application of the AMF inoculum were evaluated, of which, combined application of AMF at the seedling production and transplanting stages showed increased AMF , which significantly improved grain yield by 25.08% and also increased uptake of phosphorus by 18.2% and nitrogen by 49.5%, as observed at 700-ppm CO concentration. Organic acids secretion in rice root increased in AMF-inoculated plants exposed to 700-ppm CO concentration. To understand the overall effect of CO elevation on AMF interaction with the rice plant, principal component and partial least square regression analysis were performed, which found both positive and negative responses under elevated CO concentration.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Its genome contains 177 unique O islands (OIs), which contribute largely to the high virulence and pathogenicity although most OI genes remain uncharacterized. In the current study, we demonstrated that OI-19 is required for EHEC O157:H7 adherence to host cells. Z0442 (OI-encoded virulence regulator A [OvrA]) encoded in OI-19 positively regulated bacterial adherence by activating locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) gene expression through direct OvrA binding to the gene promoter region of the LEE gene master regulator Ler. Mouse  experiments revealed that OvrA promotes EHEC O157:H7 adherence in mouse intestine, preferentially the colon. Finally, OvrA also regulated virulence in other non-O157 pathogenic E. coli, including EHEC strains O145:H28 and O157:H16 and enteropathogenic E. coli strain O55:H7. Our work markedly enriches the understanding of bacterial adherence control and provides another example of laterally acquired regulators that mediate LEE gene expression.© The Author(s) 2019.

The plant-PGPR interaction, with special reference to chemical signalling molecules is not understood clearly, unlike other beneficial plant-microbe interactions. Chemo-attraction of a PGPR from soil microbial pool towards a plant could be dependent on some of the molecules in the plant root exudates (REs), similar to the beneficial association of legume-rhizobia. In this study, a few functional properties of PGPR like growth, chemotaxis, and biofilm formation by two PGPR strains viz., Bacillus sonorensis RS4 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa RP2 were assessed in the presence of groundnut REs. Functional properties of both the strains were significantly influenced by the REs in a strain-dependent manner. Metabolite profiling of the REs from PGPR-bacterized (RS4 or RP2) and non-bacterized seedlings was performed with GC-MS/MS after 12 and 24 days of growth. A total of 75 metabolites were detected in groundnut REs. Threonine and glyoxylic oxime acid were detected in RP2-bacterized REs, while serine, pentanoic acid, glucopyranoside, tartaric acid, and 2-pyrrolidinone were detected in REs of seedlings bacterized with RP2 and RS4. The results suggested that the PGPR induced distinct variations in the REs. Identification of the interaction-specific metabolites will be useful to develop effective PGPR based bio-formulations for better PGPR  and improving crop yields.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Combinatorial inactivation of these integrins on prostate cancer cells was assessed. Monospecific antibodies to α5β1 and αv integrins alone (MAbs) and in combination (cMAbs), and a bispecific antibody that simultaneously targets α5β1and αv integrins (BsAbα5β1/αv) were compared in assays of chemotaxis, clonogenic survival and induction of endothelial migration. Cellular expression of integrins, their transcription, translation and degradation fate was compared. The BsAbα5β1/αv was superior to MAbs and cMAbs in abrogating adhesion, migration, clonogenic survival and induction of endothelial migration responses by prostate cancer cells. Integrin upregulation observed with MAbs or cMAbs was abrogated with the BsAbα5β1/αv. Loss of integrin expression was uniquely induced by the BsAbα5β1/αv and blocked by lysosomal inhibition. Implications: A novel and effective combinatorial strategy to target α5β1 and αv integrins is defined for translational studies.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621248>[Advances in mechanisms of nutrient exchange between mycorrhizal fungi and host plants].</a></h2><p>Mycorrhizae, formed through the  of soil mycorrhizal fungi into the roots of host plants, are common symbiosis in the terrestrial ecosystems. The establishment of mycorrhizae is mainly based on the bidirectional nutrient exchanges between the symbiotic partners. Mycorrhizal fungi can absorb mineral nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, from soil and transport them to the host plants for their growth. As an exchange, host plants supply mycorrhizal fungi with the carbohydrates in the form of lipids or sugars, which are essential for fungal growth. In recent years, the mechanism of nutrient exchange between the mycorrhizal fungi and host plants has been a hot research topic. Important progresses have been achieved in mechanisms of host plants nutrient uptake and transport mediated by the mycorrhizal fungi. In this review, recent advances in nutrient exchange between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, ectomycorrhizal fungi and host plants were summarized, especially in the absorption and bidirectional transfer mechanisms of important nutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. The potential regulatory effects of nutrient exchange in the mycorrhizal development were also reviewed. In addition, key problems and prospects of related researches were analyzed. This paper would be meaningful for the establishment of mycorrhizal model and the optimization of mycorrhizal effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627163>Short communication: Gut microbial  of the mouse colon using faecal transfer was equally effective when comparing rectal inoculation and oral inoculation based on 16S rRNA sequencing.</a></h2><p>In the present study we hypothesized that a higher degree of gut microbiota (GM) transfer and  could be reached by rectal inoculation compared to oral inoculation, which is commonly used in mouse studies for GM transfer. We treated C57BL/6NTac Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) mice with antibiotics and subsequently we inoculated these with GM from donor mice of the same strain by either the oral or the rectal inoculation method. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the colon microbiota showed no difference in microbial community on account of inoculation method as determined by unweighted UniFrac distance metrics in C57BL/6NTac SPF mice. In addition, qPCR analysis on colon tissue revealed no difference in mRNA expression between the inoculation methods. Next, the SPF mice were compared to germ-free (GF)-mice to identify differences in inoculation efficacy. Whether the mice were antibiotic treated SPF or GF clearly influenced GM determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing where the SPF mice experienced up-regulation of S24-7 (p = .0001) and a decrease in Rikenellaceae (p = .016) compared to GF mice. qPCR analysis on colon tissue revealed up-regulation in mRNA gene expression of Il6, Il10, Reg3g and transcription factor RORγt (Rorc) in GF mice compared to SPF mice on a significant level (p < .05). This gene expression profile is consistent with post  development of the intestinal barrier in GF mice.Copyright © 2018.

While the frequency of infection following elective orthopedic surgery is low, rates of reinfection are disturbingly high.  is responsible for the majority of chronic osteomyelitis cases and is often considered to be incurable due to bacterial persistence deep within bone. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on clinical classifications of osteomyelitis and the ensuing treatment algorithm. Given the high patient morbidity, mortality, and economic burden caused by osteomyelitis, it is important to elucidate mechanisms of bone infection to inform novel strategies for prevention and curative treatment. Recent discoveries in this field have identified three distinct reservoirs of bacterial biofilm including:  abscess communities in the local soft tissue and bone marrow, glycocalyx formation on implant hardware and necrotic tissue, and  of the osteocyte-lacuno canalicular network (OLCN) of cortical bone. In contrast,  intracellular persistence in bone cells has not been substantiated in vivo, which challenges this mode of chronic osteomyelitis. There have also been major advances in our understanding of the immune proteome against , from clinical studies of serum antibodies and media enriched for newly synthesized antibodies (MENSA), which may provide new opportunities for osteomyelitis diagnosis, prognosis, and vaccine development. Finally, novel therapies such as antimicrobial implant coatings and antibiotic impregnated 3D-printed scaffolds represent promising strategies for preventing and managing this devastating disease.

As immunosuppressive drugs affect the intestinal immune response is little known. In the present study, we investigated the immune response to  infection in the IM and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) in cyclophosphamide (Cy) immunosuppressed mice, to mimic an immunocompromised condition. Histopathology revealed lymphoplasmacytic enteritis at 7 and 14 days-post-infection (dpi) in all infected groups, however, inflammation diminished at 21 and 28 dpi. Cy treatment also led to a higher number of  spores and lesions, which reduced at 28 dpi. In addition, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated CD4 and CD8 T cells to be predominant immune cells, with up-regulation in both Th1 and Th2 cytokines at 7 and 14 dpi, as demonstrated by histopathology.

This indicates that pine trees could be accessing a hidden nitrogen source to fulfill their nitrogen requirements-possibly via endophytic nitrogen-fixation. Endophytic bacteria originally isolated from native pine trees growing at gravel sites were selected (n = 14) for in vitro nitrogen-fixation assays and a yearlong greenhouse study to test the overall hypothesis that naturally-occurring endophytic nitrogen-fixing bacteria sustain pine tree growth under nitrogen-limited conditions. Each of the 14 bacteria colonized the internal tissues of pine trees in the greenhouse study and fixed significant amounts of nitrogen from atmosphere (23-53%) after one year as estimated through 15N isotope dilution assay. Bacterial inoculation also significantly enhanced the length (31-64%) and biomass (100-311%) of pine seedlings as compared to the non-inoculated control treatment. In addition, presence of the nifH gene was confirmed in all 14 bacteria. Our results support the possibility that pine trees associate with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, capable of endophytic , to survive at unreclaimed gravel mining pits and this association could potentially be utilized for effective reclamation of highly disturbed sites in a sustainable manner.© FEMS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665178>Correction: Effect of early measles vaccine on pneumococcal : A randomized trial from Guinea-Bissau.</a></h2><p>[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0177547.].</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669781>Scophthalmus maximus interleukin-1β limits Edwardsiella piscicida  in vivo.</a></h2><p>Interleukine-1β (IL-1β) is the first identified pro-inflammatory cytokine, which is cleaved by caspase-1 following the inflammasomes activation, playing critical roles in innate immunity.

Despite this, the pertinent mechanisms underlying  O157:H7  and internalization remain poorly documented. Herein we aimed to elucidate these mechanisms in cucumbers using an inverted fluorescence microscope and hyperspectral microscopy. We observed that  O157:H7 primarily colonized around the stomata on cucumber epidermis without invading the internal tissues of intact cucumbers. Once the bacterial cells had infiltrated into the internal tissues, they colonized the cucumber placenta and vascular bundles (xylem vessels, in particular), and also migrated along the xylem vessels.

The most potent oligomers, TZP3 and TZP5 not only displayed potent antibacterial action on various drug-resistant pathogens but also exhibited a strong synergic antibacterial activity in combination with chloramphenicol against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRPA). Since most of atopic dermatitis (AD) infections are caused by bacterial , we evaluated the potency of TZP3 and TZP5 on AD in vitro and in vivo. In vitro AD analysis of these two polymers showed significant inhibition against the release of β-hexosaminidase and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) from RBL-2H3 cells. In AD-like skin lesions in BALB/c mice model, these two polymers displayed significant potency in suppressing dermal and epidermal thickness, mast cell infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression. Moreover, these polymers exhibited remarkable efficacy over the allergies caused by the imbalance of Th1/Th2 by regulating total IgE and IgG2a. Finally, the impact of treatment effects of these polymers was examined through analyzing the weights and sizes of spleen and lymph node of AD-induced mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673531>Molecular Characterization of  Isolated from Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia and Burn Wound  by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Polymerase Chain Reaction and the Relationship between Antibiotic Susceptibility and Biofilm Production.</a></h2><p>Multidrug-resistant  can cause complications in antibiotic therapy and increase the rate of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients.

Bacitracin is used widely as a growth promoter in animal feed and to control the spread of necrotic enteritis in most developing countries. This study aimed to characterize a novel membrane transporter module Sst comprising SstE, SstF, and SstG for bacitracin resistance.Comparative genomics and protein homology analysis found a potential efflux pump SstFEG encoded upstream of well-known bacitracin-resistance genes bceAB and bceRS. A four-fold decrease in bacitracin susceptibility was observed in sstFEG deletion mutant comparing with S. suis wildtype strain CZ130302. Further studies indicated that the bacitracin tolerance mediated by SstFEG is not only independent of the BceAB transporter, but also regulated by the two-component system BceSR. Given that SstFEG are harbored by almost all virulent strains, but not in the avirulent strains, we managed to explore its potential role in bacterial pathogencity. Indeed, our results showed that SstFEG is involved in S. suis  and virulence in animal infection model by its potential competitive survival advantage against host bactericidal effect.To our knowledge, this is the first study to functionally characterize the bacitracin efflux pump in S. suis to provide evidence regarding the important roles of the novel ABC transporter system SstFEG with respect to drug resistance and virulence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616626>4T1 Mammary Carcinoma  of Metastatic Niches Is Accelerated by Obesity.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer (BC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women, and the chances to develop it are duplicated by obesity. Still, the impact of obesity during BC progression remains less understood. We investigated the role of obesity in tumor progression using the murine model of 4T1 mammary carcinoma in BALB/c female mice, previously high-fat-diet (HFD) fed. HFD induced obesity, metabolic impairment, and high serum and fat leptin levels. After injection of 4T1-cells, HFD-mice accelerated tumor progression and metastasis. 4T1-cells found within HFD-mice metastatic niches presented higher clonogenic potential. 4T1-cells treated  with fat-conditioned medium derived from HFD-mice, increased migration capacity through CXCL12 and CCL25 gradients. In HFD-mice, the infiltration and activation of immune cells into tumor-sentinel lymph nodes was overall reduced, except for activated CD4 T cells expressing low CD25 levels. Within the bone marrow, the levels of haematopoiesis-related IL-6 and TNF-α decreased after 4T1-cells injection in HFD-mice whereas increased in the controls, suggesting that upregulation of both cytokines, regardless of the tumor, is disrupted by obesity. Finally, the expression of genes for leptin, CXCR4, and CCR9 (receptors of CXCL12 and CCL25, respectively) was negatively correlated with the infiltration of CD8 T cells in human triple-negative BC tumors from obese patients compared to non-obese. Together, our data present early evidence of systemic networks triggered by obesity that promote BC progression to the metastatic niches. Targeting these pathways might be useful to prevent the rapid BC progression observed among obese patients.Copyright © 2019 Evangelista, Salvador, Soares, Barros, Xavier, Abdo, Gualberto, Macedo, Clavijo-Salomon and Gameiro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618810>Influence of Laminin Coating on the Autologous In Vivo Recellularization of Decellularized Vascular Protheses.</a></h2><p>Decellularization of non-autologous biological implants reduces the immune response against foreign tissue. Striving for in vivo repopulation of aortic prostheses with autologous cells, thereby improving the graft biocompatibility, we examined surface coating with laminin in a standardized rat implantation model. Detergent-decellularized aortic grafts from donor rats (n = 37) were coated with laminin and systemically implanted into Wistar rats. Uncoated implants served as controls. Implant re- and remodeling were examined by scanning electron microscopy (n = 10), histology and immunohistology (n = 18). Laminin coating persisted over eight weeks. Two weeks after implantation, no relevant neoendothelium formation was observed, whereas it was covering the whole grafts after eight weeks, with a significant acceleration in the laminin group (p = 0.0048). Remarkably, the intima-to-media ratio, indicating adverse hyperplasia, was significantly diminished in the laminin group (p = 0.0149). No intergroup difference was detected in terms of medial recellularization (p = 0.2577). Alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells originating from the adventitial surface invaded the media in both groups to a similar extent. The amount of calcifying hydroxyapatite deposition in the intima and the media did not differ between the groups. Inflammatory cell markers (CD3 and CD68) proved negative in coated as well as uncoated decellularized implants. The coating of decellularized aortic implants with bioactive laminin caused an acceleration of the autologous recellularization and a reduction of the intima hyperplasia. Thereby, laminin coating seems to be a promising strategy to enhance the biocompatibility of tissue-engineered vascular implants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630178>Persistent  of non-lymphoid tissue-resident macrophages by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence has revealed that lymphoid-tissue-resident commensal bacteria (e.g., Alcaligenes spp.) survive within dendritic cells.

The in situ intracellular  by S. maltophilia was recapitulated in vitro by using bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Co-culture of BMDMs with clinically isolated S. maltophilia led to increased mitochondrial respiration and robust IL-10 production. We further identified a 25-kDa protein encoded by the gene assigned as smlt2713 (recently renamed as SMLT_RS12935) and secreted by S. maltophilia as the factor responsible for enhanced IL-10 production by BMDMs. IL-10 production is critical for maintenance of the symbiotic condition, because intracellular  by S. maltophilia was impaired in IL-10-deficient BMDMs, and smlt2713-deficient S. maltophilia failed to persistently colonize IL-10-competent BMDMs. These findings indicate a novel commensal network between colonic macrophages and S. maltophilia that is mediated by IL-10 and smlt2713.© The Author(s) 2019.

In particular, children with life-limiting conditions have a significantly increased risk of multidrug resistant pathogen . Official hygiene requirements recommend children, who are colonized with multidrug resistant pathogens, to be isolated. In the context of pediatric palliative care, such isolation adversely affects the aim of social participation. To overcome this challenge of conflicting interests on a pediatric palliative care inpatient unit, a hygiene concept for patients colonized with multidrug resistant pathogens, called PALLINI, was implemented.The aim of this study was to identify the nurses' attitudes and opinions toward PALLINI.Nurses ( = 14) from the pediatric palliative care unit were queried in guideline-oriented interviews. Interviews were analyzed qualitatively by means of content analysis.The following four categories were identified: (1) safety, (2) effort, (3) quality of care, and (4) participation. All categories demonstrated ambivalence by nursing staff regarding PALLINI. Ambivalence arose from guaranteeing infection control versus noncompliance by the families, additional workload for patients with multidrug resistant pathogens versus lack of resources, impaired relationship with the parents versus enabling better care for the child, as well as enabling some limited contact versus the larger goal of genuine social participation. Despite this, nurses reported the importance of arranging everyday-life for the patients so that they experience as much social participation as possible.The implementation of a new hygiene concept is challenging. Despite positive reception of PALLINI from the nurses, ambivalence remained. Addressing these ambivalences may be critical to best implement the new hygiene concept.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632380>Pneumococcal VncR Strain-Specifically Regulates Capsule Polysaccharide Synthesis.</a></h2><p>Capsular polysaccharides (CPS), a major virulence factor in , become thicker during blood invasion while not during asymptomatic nasopharyngeal . However, the underlying mechanism controlling this differential pneumococcal CPS regulation remain unclear. Here, we show how VncR, the response regulator of the vancomycin resistance locus ( operon), regulates CPS expression in  mutants in three serotype (type 2, 3, and 6B) backgrounds upon exposure to serum lactoferrin (LF). Comparative analysis of CPS levels in the wild type (WT) of three strains and their isogenic  mutants after LF exposure revealed a strain-specific alteration in CPS production. Consistently, VncR-mediated strain-specific CPS production is correlated with pneumococcal virulence, . Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay and co-immunoprecipitation revealed an interaction between VncR and the  promoter () in the presence of serum. In addition,  analysis uncovered this protein-DNA interaction, suggesting that VncR binds with the , and recognizes the strain-specific significance of the tandem repeats in . Taken together, the interaction of VncR and  after serum exposure plays an essential role in regulating differential strain-specific CPS production, which subsequently determines strain-specific systemic virulence. This study highlights how host protein LF contributes to pneumococcal VncR-mediated CPS production. As CPS plays a significant role in immune evasion, these findings suggest that drugs designed to interrupt the VncR-mediated CPS production could help to combat pneumococcal infections.Copyright © 2019 Ghosh, Shah, Ravichandran, Park, Iqbal, Choi, Kim and Rhee.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666702>Immunity to commensal papillomaviruses protects against skin cancer.</a></h2><p>Immunosuppression increases the risk of cancers that are associated with viral infection. In particular, the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin-which has been associated with beta human papillomavirus (β-HPV) infection-is increased by more than 100-fold in immunosuppressed patients. Previous studies have not established a causative role for HPVs in driving the development of skin cancer. Here we show that T cell immunity against commensal papillomaviruses suppresses skin cancer in immunocompetent hosts, and the loss of this immunity-rather than the oncogenic effect of HPVs-causes the markedly increased risk of skin cancer in immunosuppressed patients. To investigate the effects of papillomavirus on carcinogen-driven skin cancer, we colonized several strains of immunocompetent mice with mouse papillomavirus type 1 (MmuPV1). Mice with natural immunity against MmuPV1 after  and acquired immunity through the transfer of T cells from immune mice or by MmuPV1 vaccination were protected against skin carcinogenesis induced by chemicals or by ultraviolet radiation in a manner dependent on CD8 T cells. RNA and DNA in situ hybridization probes for 25 commensal β-HPVs revealed a significant reduction in viral activity and load in human skin cancer compared with the adjacent healthy skin, suggesting a strong immune selection against virus-positive malignant cells. Consistently, E7 peptides from β-HPVs activated CD8 T cells from unaffected human skin.

Whether this phenomenon exists in cattle is largely unknown. Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to evaluate the impact of maternal post-ruminal supply of methionine during late-pregnancy in dairy cows on fecal microbiota and metabolome in neonatal calves, and their association with body development and growth performance during the preweaning period. To achieve this, heifer calves, i.e., neonatal female offspring, born to Holstein cows receiving either a control (CON) diet ( = 13) or CON plus rumen-protected methionine (MET; Evonik Nutrition & Care GmbH) during the last 28 days of pregnancy were used. Fecal samples from heifers were collected from birth until 6 weeks of age, i.e., the preweaning period. Fecal microbiota was analyzed with QIIME 2 whereas fecal metabolites were measured using an untargeted LC-MS approach. At birth, MET heifers had greater ( ≤ 0.05) BW, HH, and WH. During the preweaning period, no differences between groups were detected for starter intake ( = 0.77). However, MET heifers maintained greater ( ≤ 0.05) BW, HH and tended ( = 0.06) to have greater WH and average daily gain (ADG) ( = 0.10). Fecal microbiota and metabolome profiles through 42 days of age in MET heifers indicated greater capacity for hindgut production of endogenous antibiotics and enhanced hindgut functionality and health. Enhancing maternal post-ruminal supply of methionine during late-gestation in dairy cows has a positive effect on hindgut functionality and health in their offspring through alterations in the fecal microbiota and metabolome without affecting feed intake. Those alterations could limit pathogen  of the hindgut while providing essential nutrients to the neonate. Together, such responses contribute to the ability of young calves to achieve better rates of nutrient utilization for growth.Copyright © 2019 Elolimy, Alharthi, Zeineldin, Parys, Helmbrecht and Loor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607511>Segmented Filamentous Bacteria Prevent and Cure Rotavirus Infection.</a></h2><p>Rotavirus (RV) encounters intestinal epithelial cells amidst diverse microbiota, opening possibilities of microbes influencing RV infection.

Extensive data collected over the past decades on this chronic disease demonstrate that its progression is infrequent and episodic, and the susceptibility to it can vary among individuals. Physical assessments of previously occurring damage to periodontal tissues remain the cornerstone of detection and diagnosis, whereas traditionally used diagnostic procedures do neither identify susceptible individuals nor distinguish between disease-active and disease-inactive periodontal sites. Thus, more sensitive and accurate "measurable biological indicators" of periodontal diseases are needed in order to place diagnosis (e.g., the presence or stage) and management of the disease on a more rational less empirical basis. Contemporary "omics" technologies may help unlock the path to this quest. High throughput nucleic acid sequencing technologies have enabled us to examine the taxonomic distribution of microbial communities in oral health and disease, whereas proteomic technologies allowed us to decipher the molecular state of the host in disease, as well as the interactive cross-talk of the host with the microbiome. The newly established field of metaproteomics has enabled the identification of the repertoire of proteins that oral microorganisms use to compete or co-operate with each other. Vast such data is derived from oral biological fluids, including gingival crevicular fluid and saliva, which is progressively completed and catalogued as the analytical technologies and bioinformatics tools progressively advance.

Increasing antibiotic resistance has severely limited treatment options. A mechanism that Neisseria gonorrhoeae uses to evade complement attack is binding of the complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein (C4BP). We screened 107 PorB1a and 83 PorB1b clinical isolates randomly selected from a Swedish strain collection over the last 10 years and noted that 96/107 (89.7%) PorB1a and 16/83 (19.3%) PorB1b bound C4BP; C4BP binding significantly correlated with the ability to evade complement-dependent killing (r = 0.78; p<0.0001). We designed two chimeric proteins that fused C4BP domains to the backbone of immunoglobulins IgG or IgM (C4BP-IgG; C4BP-IgM) with the aim of enhancing complement activation and killing of gonococci. Both proteins bound gonococci (Kd C4BP-IgM = 2.4 nM; Kd C4BP-IgG 981 nM), but only hexameric C4BP-IgM efficiently out-competed heptameric C4BP from bacterial surface resulting in enhanced complement deposition and bacterial killing.

Recent studies indicate that lipid transfer from plants is essential for AM fungal ; however, the role of lipid transfer in arbuscule formation and the dynamics of lipid accumulation in arbuscules under low pH stress are far from well understood. In the symbiosis of tomato and Rhizophagus intraradices under contrasting pH conditions (pH 4.5 vs. pH 6.5), we investigated arbuscule formation, nutrient uptake, alkaline phosphatase activity and lipid accumulation; examined the gene expression involved in phosphate transport, lipid biosynthesis and transfer and sugar metabolism; and visualized the lipid dynamics in arbuscules. Low pH greatly inhibited arbuscule formation, in parallel with reduced phospholipid fatty acids accumulation in AM fungus and decreased P uptake. This reduction was supported by the decreased expression of plant genes encoding lipid biosynthesis and transfer. More degenerating arbuscules were observed under low pH conditions, and neutral lipid fatty acids accumulated only in degenerating arbuscules. These data reveal that, under low pH stress, reduced lipid transfer from hosts to AM fungi is responsible for the inhibited arbuscule formation.© 2019 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647042>The devil is in the details: Factors influencing hand hygiene adherence and contamination with antibiotic-resistant organisms among healthcare providers in nursing facilities.</a></h2><p>Antibiotic-resistant organism (ARO)  rates in skilled nursing facilities (NFs) are high; hand hygiene is crucial to interrupt transmission.

The purpose of this study was firstly to determine the prevalence of pneumococcus carriage in a population of febrile infants in Marrakesh and secondly, to investigate the risk factors for carriage and the distribution of circulating serotypes.This prospective study was conducted from February to June 2017, in the pediatric emergency department of the Mother and Child Hospital of Mohammed VI University Hospital Centre (UHC) in Marrakesh. At total of 183febrile infants, aged 2-18months, were enrolled in this study and were swabbed for nasopharyngeal carriage. Pneumococci were cultured, identified, serotyped, and tested for penicillin susceptibility. Demographic data and risk factors for carriage were collected. The statistical analyses performed were the following: the analysis of the risk factors using logistic regression, the estimation of serotype diversity with the Simpson index, and the Chi test to compare serotype distribution in the prevaccination (a cohort of 660 healthy children, less than 2years old, in the Marrakesh region, in 2008-2009) and postvaccination periods.The prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage was 68.3%. Of the 183infants enrolled in this study, 111 had received at least one dose of PCV-10.  by vaccine serotype among febrile children was related to incomplete vaccination status. In total, vaccine serotypes accounted for 6.4% (n=8): 19F (n=2), 1 (n=2) and one strain for each of the following serotypes: 14, 23F, 6B, and 9V. Non-vaccine and nontypeable strains presented 63.2% and 23.2%, respectively, with dominance of serotypes 6A (6.4%), 15A/15F (5.6%), 20, 22F/22A, 23B, and 11A/11D with a prevalence of 3.2%. The rate of pneumococcus strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin was 33.6%, of which 90.2% were non-vaccine serotypes and nontypeable strains. Serotype diversity increased in the postvaccination period and the effectiveness of PCV-10 against vaccine serotypes was estimated at 89.6%.An important change in the distribution of vaccine and non-vaccine serotypes was observed after the introduction of the PCVs. In fact, the prevalence of vaccine serotypes decreased significantly while non-vaccine serotypes emerged. These results underscore the importance of maintaining close and prolonged surveillance of serotype distribution to monitor the dynamics of nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage.Copyright © 2019 French Society of Pediatrics.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory abilities and effects of  RS-25,  MG-4,  Z-14, and  Pnf-4 and their culture filtrates and extracts against the gray mold caused by  on postharvest tomato, strawberry, and grapefruit. The results revealed that the cells of Z-14, culture filtrate of RS-25, and cells of Z-14 showed the strongest biocontrol activity against the gray mold on the strawberry, grape, and tomato fruit, respectively. All the strains produced volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and the VOCs of Pnf-4 displayed the highest inhibition values. Based on headspace solid-phase microextraction in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, esters accounted for the largest percentage of the VOCs produced by RS-25, MG-4, Z-14, and Pnf-4 (36.80%, 29.58%, 30.78%, and 36.26%, respectively). All the strains showed potent cellulase and protease activities, but no chitinase activity. RS-25, Z-14, and MG-4, but not Pnf-4, grew on chrome azurol S agar, and an orange halo was formed around the colonies. All the strains showed biofilm formation, fruit , and lipopeptide production, which may be the main modes of action of the antagonists against  on the fruit.

Despite the common occurrence of yeast (primarily Candida) within the vaginal microbiome, there is still an incomplete picture of relationships between yeast and bacteria (especially lactobacilli), as well as how such associations are governed. Such relationships could be important to a more holistic understanding of the vaginal microbiome and its connection to reproductive health.To perform molecular characterization of clinical specimens to define associations between vaginal bacteria (especially Lactobacillus species) and Candida . In vitro studies were conducted to test the two most common dominant Lactobacillus species (Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus iners) in their ability to inhibit Candida growth and to examine the basis for such inhibition.A nested cross-sectional study of reproductive age women from the Contraceptive CHOICE Project was conducted. Vaginal swabs from 299 women were selected to balance race and BV status, resulting in similar representation of black and white women in each of the three Nugent score categories [normal (0-3), intermediate (4-6), and bacterial vaginosis (7-10)]. Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal gene (V4 region) was used to determine the dominant Lactobacillus species present (primarily L. iners and L. crispatus), defined as >50% of the community. Subjects without dominance by a single Lactobacillus species were classified as Diverse. A Candida-specific qPCR targeting the internally transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) was validated using vaginal samples collected from a second cohort of women and used to assess Candida . 255 nonpregnant women with sufficient bacterial biomass for analysis were included in the final analysis. Generalized linear models were employed to evaluate associations between Lactobacillus dominance, sociodemographic and risk characteristics and vaginal Candida . In separate in vitro studies, the potential of cell-free supernatants from L. crispatus and L. iners cultures to inhibit Candida growth was evaluated.Forty-two women (16%) were vaginally colonized with Candida. Microbiomes characterized as Diverse (38%), L. iners-dominant (39%), and L. crispatus-dominant (20%) were the most common. The microbiome, race and Candida  co-varied with a higher prevalence of Candida among black women and L. iners-dominant communities compared to white women and L. crispatus-dominant communities. L. iners-dominant communities were more likely to harbor Candida than L. crispatus-dominant communities (OR = 2.85, 95% CI: 1.03 to 7.21; Fisher's Exact, p = 0.048). In vitro, L. crispatus produced greater concentrations of lactic acid and exhibited significantly more pH-dependent growth inhibition of C. albicans, suggesting a potential mechanism for the clinical observations.In nonpregnant women, L. iners-dominant communities were significantly more likely to harbor Candida than L. crispatus-dominant communities, suggesting that Lactobacillus species have different relationships with Candida. In vitro experiments indicate that L. crispatus may impede Candida  more effectively than L. iners through a greater production of lactic acid.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the transmission of CRE between humans and animals has not yet been well studied.We investigated the prevalence, risk factors, and drivers of CRE transmission between humans and their backyard animals in rural China.We conducted a comprehensive sampling strategy in 12 villages in Shandong, China. Using the household [residents and their backyard animals (farm and companion animals)] as a single surveillance unit, we assessed the prevalence of CRE at the household level and examined the factors associated with CRE carriage through a detailed questionnaire. Genetic relationships among human- and animal-derived CRE were assessed using whole-genome sequencing-based molecular methods.A total of 88 New Delhi -type carbapenem-resistant  (NDM-EC), including 17 from humans, 44 from pigs, 12 from chickens, 1 from cattle, and 2 from dogs, were isolated from 65 of the 746 households examined. The remaining 12 NDM-EC were from flies in the immediate backyard environment. The NDM-EC  in households was significantly associated with ) the number of species of backyard animals raised/kept in the same household, and ) the use of human and/or animal feces as fertilizer. Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) revealed that a large proportion of the core genomes of the NDM-EC belonged to strains from hosts other than their own, and several human isolates shared closely related core single-nucleotide polymorphisms and  genetic contexts with isolates from backyard animals.To our knowledge, we are the first to report evidence of direct transmission of NDM-EC between humans and animals. Given the rise of NDM-EC in community and hospital infections, combating NDM-EC transmission in backyard farm systems is needed. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5251.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613567>Acne Vulgaris: Diagnosis and Treatment.</a></h2><p>Acne vulgaris is the most prevalent chronic skin disease in the United States, affecting nearly 50 million people per year, mostly adolescents and young adults. Potential sequelae of acne, such as scarring, dyspigmentation, and low self-esteem, may result in significant morbidity. Typical acne lesions involve the pilosebaceous follicles and the interrelated processes of sebum production, Cutibacterium acnes (previously called Propionibacterium acnes) , and inflammation. Acne may be classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on the number and type of skin lesions. Multiple treatment agents and formulations are available, with each agent targeting a specific area within acne pathogenesis. Treatment selection is based on disease severity, patient preference, and tolerability. Topical retinoids are indicated for acne of any severity and for maintenance therapy. Systemic and topical antibiotics should be used only in combination with benzoyl peroxide and retinoids and for a maximum of 12 weeks. Isotretinoin is used for severe, recalcitrant acne. Because of the risk of teratogenicity, patients, pharmacists, and prescribers must register with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated risk management program, iPledge, before implementing isotretinoin therapy. There is limited evidence for physical modalities (e.g., laser therapy, light therapy, chemical peels) and complementary therapies (e.g., purified bee venom, low-glycemic-load diet, tea tree oil); therefore, further study is required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612122>Lower Airway Microbiota.</a></h2><p>During the last several years, the interest in the role of microbiota in human health has grown significantly.

Among various factors, activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway has been documented being able to target genes associated with tumor progression and up-regulate the expression of tumor-promoting cytokines and survival genes in several human solid tumors. Feline injection sites sarcomas (FISS) are malignant entities derived from the mesenchymal origin. The disease has been considered to be associated with vaccine adjuvant, aluminum, which serves as a stimulus continuously inducing overzealous inflammatory and immunologic reactions. To understand the contribution of NF-κB in FISS, detection of activated NF-κB in paraffin-embedded specimens, in vitro establishment of primary cells derived from FISS, and evaluation of the effects of the NF-κB inhibitor, dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), on primary tumor cells were conducted.In this study, nuclear expression of NF-κB p65 was detected in 83.3% of FISS cases and not correlated with tumor grading, sex, and age. Primary cells derived from FISS in three cats exhibiting same immunohistochemical characteristics as their original tumor were successfully established. The NF-κB inhibitor, DHMEQ, was able to prevent nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65, inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and  in dosage-dependent manners, and induce cell apoptosis in these primary FISS cells.High expression rate of nuclear NF-κB p65 in FISS cases and dose-dependent inhibitory effects on the growth of FISS primary cells treated with NF-κB inhibitor suggested that NF-κB might be a potential molecular therapeutic target for FISS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619301>Sequential use of povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis: A systematic review.</a></h2><p>Cutaneous antisepsis with chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine, usually with alcohol, has been extensively studied.

The predominant causative agents are uropathogenic Escherichia coli. These strains differ from commensal E. coli by the presence of additional horizontally acquired chromosomal material, so-called pathogenicity islands, which encode traits that promote efficient bacterial  of the urinary tract. Uropathogenic model strain E. coli 536 possesses six archetypal pathogenicity islands. Bacteriophage-like integrases encoded by each pathogenicity island contribute to island instability. To learn more about the stability of these six islands and factors controlling their stability we constructed two chromosomal reporter systems for the measurement of island loss, as well as for the measurement of the promoter activity of the six island-associated integrase genes at the population level. We used these reporter gene modules to analyze the role of SOS response in island instability. Tests with subinhibitory concentrations of different antibiotics, including many drugs commonly used for the treatment of urinary tract infection, indicated that only SOS response-inducing antibiotics led to an increased loss of islands which was always associated with an increase in the bacterial subpopulations showing high integrase promoter activity. This suggests that island excision correlates with the expression of the cognate integrase. Our reporter modules are valuable tools to investigate the impact of various growth conditions on genome plasticity. Furthermore, a better understanding of the conditions, which affect bacterial integrase expression may open ways to specifically manipulate the genome content of bacterial pathogens by increasing pathogenicity island deletion rates in infecting or colonizing bacteria, thus leading to the attenuation of bacterial pathogens.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

As a motile bacterium approaches and adheres to a surface from the bulk fluid, the mechanical forces that act on it change. Bacteria are able to sense these changes in the mechanical load through a process termed mechanosensing. Bacterial mechanosensing has featured prominently in recent literature as playing a key role in surface sensing. However, the changes in mechanical loads on different parts of the cell at a surface vary in magnitudes as well as in signs. This confounds the determination of a causal relationship between the activation of specific mechanosensors and surface sensing. Here, we explain how contrasting mechanical stimuli arise on a surface-adherent cell and how known mechanosensors respond to these stimuli. The evidence for mechanosensing in select bacterial species is re-interpreted, with a focus on mechanosensitive molecular motors. We conclude with proposed criteria that bacterial mechanosensors must satisfy to successfully mediate surface sensing.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

This early stage soil is then colonized by microbes and vegetation in a process of primary succession. It is rarely experimentally examined whether this  process is linear or not at the ecosystem scale. Thus, to improve our understanding of the variables involved in the carbon accumulation in the different stages of primary succession, we conducted this research in three transects on the Matsch glacier forefield (Alps, N Italy) at an altitude between 2,350 and 2,800 m a.s.l.In three field campaigns (July, August and September 2014) a closed transparent chamber was used to quantify the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) between the natural vegetation and the atmosphere. On the five plots established in each of the three transects, shading nets were used to determine ecosystem response function to variable light conditions. Ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross ecosystem exchange (GEE) was partitioned from NEE. Following the final flux measurements, biometric sampling was conducted to establish soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content and the biomass components for each transect.A clear difference was found between the earlier and the later successional stage. The older successional stages in the lower altitudes acted as a stronger C sink, where NEE, GEE and Reco were significantly higher than in the earlier successional stage. Of the two lower transects, the sink capacity of intermediate-succession plots exceeded that of the plots of older formation, in spite of the more developed soil. Total biomass (above- and belowground) approached its maximum value in the intermediate ecosystem, whilst the later stage of succession predominated in the corresponding belowground organic mass (biomass, N and C).We found that the process of carbon accumulation along a glacier retreat chronosequence is not linear, and after a quite rapid increase in carbon accumulation capacity in the first 150 years, in average 9 g C m year, it slows down, taking place mainly in the belowground biomass components. Concurrently, the photosynthetic capacity peaks in the intermediate stage of ecosystem development. If confirmed by further studies on a larger scale, this study would provide evidence for a predominant effect of plant physiology over soil physical characteristics in the green-up phase after glacier retreat, which has to be taken into account in the creation of scenarios related to climate change and future land use.© 2019 Montagnani et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615004>Crystal Structure-Based Exploration of Arginine-Containing Peptide Binding in the ADP-Ribosyltransferase Domain of the Type III Effector XopAI Protein.</a></h2><p>Plant pathogens secrete proteins called effectors into the cells of their host to modulate the host immune response against . Effectors can either modify or arrest host target proteins to sabotage the signaling pathway, and therefore are considered potential drug targets for crop disease control. In earlier research, the  type III effector XopAI was predicted to be a member of the arginine-specific mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase family. However, the crystal structure of XopAI revealed an altered active site that is unsuitable to bind the cofactor NAD+, but with the capability to capture an arginine-containing peptide from XopAI itself. The arginine peptide consists of residues 60 through 69 of XopAI, and residue 62 (R62) is key to determining the protein-peptide interaction. The crystal structure and the molecular dynamics simulation results indicate that specific arginine recognition is mediated by hydrogen bonds provided by the backbone oxygen atoms from residues W154, T155, and T156, and a salt bridge provided by the E265 sidechain. In addition, a protruding loop of XopAI adopts dynamic conformations in response to arginine peptide binding and is probably involved in target protein recognition. These data suggest that XopAI binds to its target protein by the peptide-binding ability, and therefore, it promotes disease progression. Our findings reveal an unexpected and intriguing function of XopAI and pave the way for further investigation on the role of XopAI in pathogen invasion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633202>Population history of southern Italy during Greek  inferred from dental remains.</a></h2><p>We are testing competing scenarios regarding the population history of the ancient Greek  of southern Italy using dental phenotypic evidence.We collected dental metric and nonmetric trait data for 481 human skeletons from six archaeological sites along the Gulf of Taranto, dating to pre-colonial (900-700 BC) and post-colonial periods (700-200 BC). We are evaluating scenarios through an individual-level biodistance analysis using a three-pronged approach: (a) by analyzing levels of mobility in pre- and post-colonial periods under a model of isolation-by-distance; (b) by quantifying differences in group means and variances in pre- and post-colonial periods utilizing permutational multivariate analysis of variance and Betadisper analyses; and (c) by identifying ancestries of post-colonial individuals using naïve Bayes classification.Southern Italy during pre-colonial times was characterized by low levels of mobility and marked differences in group means and variances. During post-colonial times, mobility increased and there were no differences in group means and variances. About 18% of the people in post-colonial times were of Greek ancestry and lived equally distributed across Greek colonies and indigenous villages. Nevertheless, the overall biological composition and variability of southern Italy remained relatively unchanged across pre- and post-colonial periods.Our results support a scenario in which only few Greek colonists migrated to southern Italy and lived in smaller numbers alongside indigenous people in Greek colonies as well as in indigenous villages. Our results contradict a scenario in which large numbers of Greek invaders founded biologically isolated and substantially homogeneous colonial enclaves within conquered territories.© 2019 The Authors.

There is growing evidence that reprogramming of cellular lipid metabolism contributes to malignant transformation and progression. Lipid metabolism is implicated in cell differentiation and metastatic  and it is involved in the mechanisms of sensitivity/resistance to different anti-tumor agents. The role played by lipids in the anti-tumor activity of ATRA has never been studied.We used 16 breast cancer cell-lines whose degree of sensitivity to the anti-proliferative action of ATRA is known. We implemented a non-oriented mass-spectrometry based approach to define the lipidomic profiles of each cell-line grown under basal conditions and following treatment with ATRA. To complement the lipidomic data, untreated and retinoid treated cell-lines were also subjected to RNA-sequencing to define the perturbations afforded by ATRA on the whole-genome gene-expression profiles. The number and functional activity of mitochondria were determined in selected ATRA-sensitive and -resistant cell-lines. Bio-computing approaches were used to analyse the high-throughput lipidomic and transcriptomic data.ATRA perturbs the homeostasis of numerous lipids and the most relevant effects are observed on cardiolipins, which are located in the mitochondrial inner membranes and play a role in oxidative-phosphorylation. ATRA reduces the amounts of cardiolipins and the effect is associated with the growth-inhibitory activity of the retinoid. Down-regulation of cardiolipins is due to a reduction of mitochondria, which is caused by an ATRA-dependent decrease in the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. This demonstrates that ATRA anti-tumor activity is due to a decrease in the amounts of mitochondria causing deficits in the respiration/energy-balance of breast-cancer cells.The observation that ATRA anti-proliferative activity is caused by a reduction in the respiration and energy balance of the tumor cells has important ramifications for the therapeutic action of ATRA in breast cancer. The study may open the way to the development of rational therapeutic combinations based on the use of ATRA and anti-tumor agents targeting the mitochondria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644908>Cutaneous Immune Cell-Microbiota Interactions Are Controlled by Epidermal JunB/AP-1.</a></h2><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a multi-factorial skin disease with a complex inflammatory signature including type 2 and type 17 activation.

Additionally, using Rag1 mice, we demonstrate that adaptive immune cells are necessary for protection against S. aureus . Prophylactic antibiotics, but not antibiotics after established dysbiosis, reduce IL-17A expression and skin inflammation, examined using Il17a-eGFP reporter mice. Mechanistically, keratinocytes lacking JunB exhibit higher MyD88 levels in vitro and in vivo, previously shown to regulate S. aureus .

High levels of NO produced by NOS2/iNOS can protect against bacterial and parasitic infections, but the role of NOS in fungal innate immunity is less clear. Compared to wild type mice, Nos3-/- mice showed significantly higher survival of candidemia caused by Candida albicans SC5314. NOS3/eNOS is expressed by endothelial cells in the kidney, and  of this organ was decreased during the sub-acute stage of disseminated candidiasis. Nos3-/- mice more rapidly eliminated Candida from the renal cortex and exhibited more balanced local inflammatory reactions, with similar macrophage but less neutrophil infiltration than in infected wild type. Levels of the serum cytokines IL-9, IL-12, IL-17 and chemokines GM-CSF, MIP1α, and MIP1β were significantly elevated, and IL-15 was significantly lower in infected Nos3-/- mice. Spleens of infected Nos3-/- mice had significantly more Th2 and Th9 but not other CD4+ T cells compared with wild type. Inflammatory genes associated with leukocyte chemotaxis, IL-1 signaling, TLR signaling and Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation pathways were significantly overexpressed in infected Nos3-/- kidneys, with Nos2 being the most strongly induced. Conversely, the general NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester increased virulence in the mouse candidemia model, suggesting that iNOS contributes to the protective mechanism in infected Nos3-/- mice. By moderating neutrophil infiltration, the absence of eNOS may reduce the collateral damage to kidney cortex, and Th-9 CD4+ cells may enhance clearance of the infection.

We investigated the mechanisms by which the western diet promotes tumor recurrence, including changes in the microbiome, in mice that underwent colorectal resections.BALB/c male mice were fed either standard chow diet or western-type diet (characterized by high fat, no fiber, and decreased minerals and vitamins) for 4 weeks; some mice were given antibiotics or ABA-PEG20k-Pi20 (Pi-PEG), which inhibits collagenase production by bacteria but not bacterial growth, in drinking water. Colorectal resections and anastomoses were then performed. The first day after surgery, mice were given enemas containing collagenolytic rodent-derived strain of Enterococcus faecalis (strain E2), and the second day they were given mouse colon carcinoma cells (CT26). Twenty-one days later, distal colons were removed and colon contents (feces, distal colon, and tumor) were collected. Colon tissues were analyzed by histology, for the presence of collagenolytic colonies, and by 16S rRNA sequencing. determined the anatomical distribution of E faecalis at the site of the anastomosis and within tumors using in situ hybridization. Mouse imaging analyses were used to identify metastases.Colorectal tumors were found in 88% of mice fed the western diet and given antibiotics, surgery, and E faecalis compared with only 30% of mice fed the standard diet followed by the same procedures. Colon tumor formation correlated with the presence of collagenolytic E faecalis and Proteus mirabilis. Antibiotics eliminated collagenolytic E faecalis and P mirabilis but did not reduce tumor formation. However, antibiotics promoted emergence of Candida parapsilosis, a collagenase-producing microorganism. Administration of a Pi-PEG reduced tumor formation and maintained diversity of the colon microbiome.We identified a mechanisms by which diet and antibiotic use can promote tumorigenesis by colon cancer cells at the anastomosis following colorectal surgery.

Here we report epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological investigations of a C. auris outbreak in a regional Omani hospital between April 2018 and April 2019. The outbreak started in the intensive care areas (intensive care unit (ICU), coronary care unit (CCU), and high dependency unit) but cases were subsequently diagnosed in other medical and surgical units. In addition to the patients' clinical and screening samples, environmental swabs from high touch areas and from the hands of 35 staff were collected. All the positive samples from patients and environmental screening were confirmed using MALDI-TOF, and additional ITS-rDNA sequencing was done for ten clinical and two environmental isolates. There were 32 patients positive for C. auris of which 14 (43.8%) had urinary tract infection, 11 (34.4%) had candidemia, and 7 (21.8%) had asymptomatic skin . The median age was 64 years (14-88) with 17 (53.1%) male and 15 (46.9%) female patients. Prior to diagnosis, 21 (65.6%) had been admitted to the intensive care unit, and 11 (34.4%) had been nursed in medical or surgical wards. The crude mortality rate in our patient's cohort was 53.1. Two swabs collected from a ventilator in two different beds in the ICU were positive for C. auris. None of the health care worker samples were positive. Molecular typing showed that clinical and environmental isolates were genetically similar and all belonged to the South Asian C. auris clade I. Most isolates had non-susceptible fluconazole (100%) and amphotericin B (33%) minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), but had low echinocandin and voriconazole MICs. Despite multimodal infection prevention and control measures, new cases continued to appear, challenging all the containment efforts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657949>Assisted Evolution in Astrobiology-Convergence of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology within the Context of Planetary .</a></h2><p>In ecology and conservation biology, the concept of assisted evolution aims at the optimization of the resilience of organisms and populations to changing environmental conditions. What has hardly been considered so far is that this concept is also relevant for future astrobiological research, since in artificial extraterrestrial habitats ( plants and insects in martian greenhouses) novel environmental conditions will also affect the survival and performance of organisms. The question therefore arises whether and how space-relevant organisms can be artificially adapted to the desired circumstances in advance. Based on several adaptation and acclimatization strategies in wild ecosystems of Earth, I discuss which methods can be considered for assisted evolution in the context of astrobiological research.

The intestinal microbiota has various functions including host protection from overgrowth or  by unwanted bacteria. The exposure to antibiotics significantly reduces the bacterial density of intestinal microbiota leaving an ecologic void that can be occupied by potentially pathogenic and/or resistant bacteria frequently present in hospital settings. Consequently, the intestinal microbiota of inpatients acts as a major reservoir and plays a critical role in perpetuating the spread of resistant bacteria. There are novel innovative methods to protect the host microbiota during antibiotic treatment, but they do not offer a solution for already established  by resistant microorganisms. Fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) is a promising intervention to achieve this goal; however, controlled trials report lower success rates than initial retrospective studies, especially in case of gram negatives. The aim of the present article is to highlight the importance of the intestinal microbiota in the global spread of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms and to review the recent advances to protect the human microbiota from the action of antibiotics as well as a critical discussion about the evidence of decolonization of MDR microorganisms by FMT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625844>Nasopharyngeal Pneumococcal Density during Asymptomatic Respiratory Virus Infection and Risk for Subsequent Acute Respiratory Illness.</a></h2><p>Increased nasopharyngeal pneumococcal (Streptococcus pneumoniae)  density has been associated with invasive pneumococcal disease, but factors that increase pneumococcal density are poorly understood. We evaluated pneumococcal densities in nasopharyngeal samples from asymptomatic young children from Peru and their association with subsequent acute respiratory illness (ARI). Total pneumococcal densities (encompassing all present serotypes) during asymptomatic periods were significantly higher when a respiratory virus was detected versus when no virus was detected (p<0.001). In adjusted analyses, increased pneumococcal density was significantly associated with the risk for a subsequent ARI (p<0.001), whereas asymptomatic viral detection alone was associated with lower risk for subsequent ARI. These findings suggest that interactions between viruses and pneumococci in the nasopharynx during asymptomatic periods might have a role in onset of subsequent ARI. The mechanisms for these interactions, along with other potentially associated host and environmental factors, and their role in ARI pathogenesis and pneumococcal transmission require further elucidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611277> Requires Lipid Metabolism Genes to Replicate in Pro-inflammatory Macrophages and Mice.</a></h2><p>To survive and replicate during infection, pathogens utilize different carbon and energy sources depending on the nutritional landscape of their host microenvironment.  serovar Typhimurium () is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that occupies diverse cellular niches. While it is clear that  requires access to glucose during systemic infection, data on the need for lipid metabolism are mixed. We report that  strains lacking lipid metabolism genes were defective for systemic infection of mice. Bacterial lipid import, β-oxidation and glyoxylate shunt genes were required for tissue  upon oral or intraperitoneal inoculation. In cultured macrophages, lipid import and β-oxidation genes were required for bacterial replication and/or survival only when the cell culture medium was supplemented with non-essential amino acids. Removal of glucose from tissue culture medium further enhanced these phenotypes and, in addition, conferred a requirement for glyoxylate shunt genes. We also observed that  needs lipid metabolism genes in pro-inflammatory but not anti-inflammatory macrophages. These results suggest that during systemic infection, the  that rely upon host lipids to replicate are within pro-inflammatory macrophages that have access to amino acids, but not glucose. An improved understanding of the host microenvironments in which pathogens have specific metabolic requirements may facilitate the development of targeted approaches to treatment.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651121>Serum zinc levels in seborrheic dermatitis: a case-control study</a></h2><p>Malassezia  ,  sebaceous  gland  activity,  hormones,  immune  system  defects,  environmental  factors,  and  the interactions between these factors are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of seborrheic dermatitis (SD).

To elucidate the mechanism of this promotion, we performed transcriptomic analyses using a cohort of 23 lambs to evaluate the effects of starter diets plus alfalfa on the development of the rumen wall from the pre- to the postweaning period. The quantitative PCR analyses were used to validate selected genes that were differentially expressed in the transcriptome mapping. We found that several metabolic processes associated with rumen tissue development were affected by solid feed intake, with genes linked to the calcium signaling transduction pathway and the metabolism of pteridine-containing compounds and homocysteine metabolic process being upregulated in the group with alfalfa intervention.

Interestingly, the species occurring in the northwestern Atlantic, , is more closely related to the Pontocaspian taxa,  and , than to the species occurring in the northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. At least three  scenarios may account for this peculiar biogeographical pattern: (1) a recent human-mediated dispersal, (2) a historical transatlantic interchange, and (3) a historical transpolar interchange. To test these three scenarios, we used five operational criteria-time of species divergence, first appearance in the fossil record, dispersal limitation as well as environmental filtering and biotic interactions along the potential migration routes. Specifically, we inferred a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny for  and reconstructed a paleogeographical map of the Arctic Ocean at 2.5 million years ago (Mya). Based on the five operational criteria, scenarios 1 and 2 can likely be rejected. In contrast, all criteria support scenario 3 (historical transpolar interchange). It is therefore suggested that a bird-mediated and/or ocean current-mediated faunal interchange via the Arctic Ocean occurred during the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene. This dispersal was likely facilitated by reduced distances between the Eurasian and North American/Greenland landmasses, marine introgressions, and/or a stepping-stone system of brackish-water habitats in northern Siberia, as well as a lack of competition along the migration route. As for the direction of dispersal, the scientific data presented are not conclusive. However, there is clearly more support for the scenario of dispersal from the Pontocaspian Basin to North America than vice versa. This is the first study providing evidence for a natural faunal exchange between the Pontocaspian Basin and North America via the Arctic Ocean.© 2019 The Authors.

The objective of the present study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and effects of the consumption of a milk formula during the first year of life that is supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 or Bifidobacterium breve CECT7263, two strains originally isolated from breast milk.A randomized, double blind, controlled, parallel group study including healthy, formula-fed infants was conducted. Two hundred and thirty-six 1-month-old infants were selected and randomly divided into three study groups according to a randomization list. Infants in the control group received a standard powdered infant formula until 12 months of age. Infants in the probiotic groups received the same infant formula but supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 Lc40 or B. breve CECT7263. Main outcome was weigh-gain of infants as safety marker.One hundred and eighty-nine infants completed the eleven months of intervention (61 in control group, 65 in Lf group and 63 in Bb group).

In the context of HSCT, bloodstream infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality. Antibiotic treatment of bloodstream infections with carbapenem-resistant (CR) GNB presents a particular challenge. As a part of our infection control management, the admission of a patient who was known to be colonized with a CR  triggered an active weekly screening of all patients to determine the prevalence and potential transmission of CR GNB and CR  in particular. Over a 3 month period a total of 71 patients were regularly screened for  with CR GNB. Including the index patient, a total of three patients showed CR GNB  representing a prevalence of 4.2%. Nosocomial transmission of CR  or other CR GNB was not observed. However, the index patient developed a subsequent bloodstream infection with the CR , therefore empiric antibiotic therapy based on the known resistance profile was initiated. A weekly prevalence screening for CR GNB might be an effective monitoring tool for potential transmission, may enhance existing infection control management concepts and may support the decision making for empiric antibiotic therapy.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648274>Relative contribution of climate and non-climate drivers in determining dynamic rates of boreal birds at the edge of their range.</a></h2><p>The Adirondack Park in New York State contains a unique and limited distribution of boreal ecosystem types, providing habitat for a number of birds at the southern edge of their range. Species are projected to shift poleward in a warming climate, and the limited boreal forest of the Adirondacks is expected to undergo significant change in response to rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. Here we expand upon a previous analysis to examine changes in occupancy patterns for eight species of boreal birds over a decade (2007-2016), and we assess the relative contribution of climate and non-climate drivers in determining  and extinction rates. Our analysis identifies patterns of declining occupancy for six of eight species, including some declines which appear to have become more pronounced since a prior analysis. Although non-climate drivers such as wetland area, connectivity, and human footprint continue to influence  and extinction rates, we find that for most species, occupancy patterns are best described by climate drivers. We modeled both average and annual temperature and precipitation characteristics and find stronger support for species' responses to average climate conditions, rather than interannual climate variability. In general, boreal birds appear most likely to colonize sites that have lower levels of precipitation and a high degree of connectivity, and they tend to persist in sites that are warmer in the breeding season and have low and less variable precipitation in the winter. It is likely that these responses reflect interactions between broader habitat conditions and temperature and precipitation variables. Indirect climate influences as mediated through altered species interactions may also be important in this context. Given climate change predictions for both temperature and precipitation, it is likely that habitat structural changes over the long term may alter these relationships in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644315>Association between  Complex Pulmonary Disease and Mycobacteria in Home Water and Soil: A Case-Control Study.</a></h2><p>Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), including Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), are emerging pathogens that can opportunistically cause debilitating pulmonary disease in susceptible human hosts.

Mycobacteria in environmental samples were identified in a blinded fashion by using bacteriological culture combined with PCR. The isolation of NTM from case homes (N = 56) vs. control homes (N = 51) was quantitatively compared using conditional logistic regression models with adjustment for potential confounding variables.NTM were isolated from shower aerosols collected in case homes more often than in control homes. An adjusted conditional logistic regression analysis showed that NTM isolation from shower aerosols had a high odds ratio associated with disease (OR, 4.0., 95% CI, 1.2-13).

Due to a high level of functional redundancy of these transporters, it is difficult to identify those that are of most importance in conferring resistance to specific compounds. The esistance-odulation-ivision (RND) protein family is one such example of redundant transporters that are widespread among Gram-negative bacteria. Within this family, the MexAB-OprM protein complex is highly expressed and conserved among  species. We exposed barcoded transposon mutant libraries in isogenic wild-type and Δ backgrounds in  B728a to diverse toxic compounds  to identify mutants with increased susceptibility to these compounds. Mutants with mutations in genes encoding both known and novel redundant transporters but with partially overlapping substrate specificities were observed in a Δ background. Psyr_0228, an uncharacterized member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters, preferentially contributes to tolerance of acridine orange and acriflavine. Another transporter located in the inner membrane, Psyr_0541, contributes to tolerance of acriflavine and berberine. The presence of multiple redundant, genomically encoded efflux transporters appears to enable bacterial strains to tolerate a diversity of environmental toxins. This genome-wide screen performed in a hypersusceptible mutant strain revealed numerous transporters that would otherwise be dispensable under these conditions. Bacterial strains such as  that likely encounter diverse toxins in their environment, such as in association with many different plant species, probably benefit from possessing multiple redundant transporters that enable versatility with respect to toleration of novel toxicants. Bacteria use protein pumps to remove toxic compounds from the cell interior, enabling survival in diverse environments. These protein pumps can be highly redundant, making their targeted examination difficult. In this study, we exposed mutant populations of  to diverse toxicants to identify pumps that contributed to survival in those conditions. In parallel, we examined pump redundancy by testing mutants of a population lacking the primary efflux transporter responsible for toxin tolerance. We identified partial substrate overlap for redundant transporters, as well as several pumps that appeared more substrate specific. For bacteria that are found in diverse environments, having multiple, partially redundant efflux pumps likely allows flexibility in habitat .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638584>A flowchart is always useful: application to the interpretation of the cytobacteriological examination of urine.</a></h2><p>The cytobacteriological examination of urine (CBEU) is the most prescribed test in a microbiology laboratory.

Here, we show that the formate dehydrogenase electron-donating complex, FdnGHI, also clusters at the cell poles under nitrate-respiring conditions. Its proximity to the nitrate reductase complex was confirmed by its identification in the interactome of the latter, which appears to be specific to the nitrate-respiring condition. Interestingly, we have identified a multiprotein complex dedicated to handle nitric oxide resulting from the enhanced activity of the electron transport chain terminated by nitrate reductase. We demonstrated that the cytoplasmic NADH-dependent nitrite reductase NirBD and the hybrid cluster protein Hcp are key contributors to regulation of the nitric oxide level during nitrate respiration. Thus, gathering of actors involved in respiration and NO homeostasis seems to be critical to balancing maximization of electron flux and the resulting toxicity. Most bacteria rely on the redox activity of respiratory complexes embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane to gain energy in the form of ATP and of an electrochemical gradient established across the membrane. Nevertheless, production of harmful and toxic nitric oxide by actively growing bacteria as either an intermediate or side-product of nitrate respiration challenges how homeostasis control is exerted. Here, we show that components of the nitrate electron transport chain are clustered, likely influencing the kinetics of the process. Nitric oxide production from this respiratory chain is controlled and handled through a multiprotein complex, including detoxifying systems. These findings point to an essential role of compartmentalization of respiratory components in bacterial cell growth.Copyright © 2019 Bulot et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672506>Behavior Manipulation of Mosquitoes by a Mermithid Nematode.</a></h2><p>We examined manipulation of mosquito behavior by the parasitic mermithid nematode, Strelkovimermis spiculatus. This nematode species typically infects early instar host larvae and emerges after parasitic development to kill last-instar larvae. Parasitized adults, however, have occasionally been reported from field collections. We obtained low rates (1.7 to 11.5%) of parasitized adults in laboratory exposures only when Culex pipiens pipiens fourth-instar larvae nearing pupation were exposed to infective nematodes. This did not allow an adequate interval for parasitic development in immature host stages. Parasitized adult females in a multiple-choice assay were three times more likely to seek water than a blood source (63.1 vs. 20.5%), whereas uninfected females were twice as likely to seek blood than water (64%3.9 vs. 32.6%). This altered host behavior benefits the parasite by providing the only mechanism for dispersal and  of new host habitats while concurrently avoiding risks from the defensive behaviors associated with blood-feeding. Behavioral alternation in Cx. p. pipiens larval hosts was also examined using larvae infected as second instars to allow for a normal duration of parasitic development. As larvae neared pupation and parasite emergence, parasitized larvae became more spatially aggregated than unparasitized larvae. This altered host behavior benefits the parasite by providing a corresponding increase in post-parasite aggregation, which facilitates formation of large mating clusters and concomitantly reproductive success. Parasites derive fitness gains by overriding host autonomy, whereas hosts have zero fitness once parasitism is established, suggesting a coevolutionary response is inoperative and that the behavioral modifications may be adaptive.Copyright © 2019.

AMF also possess their own microbiota, hosting some uncultivable endobacteria. Ongoing research has revealed the genetics underlying plant responses to  by AMF, but the fungal side of the relationship remains in the dark. Here, we sequenced the genome of Gigaspora margarita, a member of the Gigasporaceae in an early diverging group of the Glomeromycotina. In contrast to other AMF, G. margarita may host distinct endobacterial populations and possesses the largest fungal genome so far annotated (773.104 Mbp), with more than 64% transposable elements. Other unique traits of the G. margarita genome include the expansion of genes for inorganic phosphate metabolism, the presence of genes for production of secondary metabolites and a considerable number of potential horizontal gene transfer events. The sequencing of G. margarita genome reveals the importance of its immune system, shedding light on the evolutionary pathways that allowed early diverging fungi to interact with both plants and bacteria.© 2019 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641443> history and population differentiation of the Honey Bees ( L.) in Puerto Rico.</a></h2><p>Honey bees ( L.) are the primary commercial pollinators across the world. The subspecies  originated in Africa and was introduced to the Americas in 1956. For the last 60 years, it hybridized successfully with European subspecies, previous residents in the area. The result of this hybridization was called Africanized honey bee (AHB). AHB has spread since then, arriving to Puerto Rico (PR) in 1994. The honey bee population on the island acquired a mosaic of features from AHB or the European honey bee (EHB). AHB in Puerto Rico shows a major distinctive characteristic, docile behavior, and is called gentle Africanized honey bees (gAHB). We used 917 SNPs to examine the population structure, genetic differentiation, origin, and history of range expansion and  of gAHB in PR. We compared gAHB to populations that span the current distribution of  worldwide. The gAHB population is shown to be a single population that differs genetically from the examined populations of AHB. Texas and PR groups are the closest genetically. Our results support the hypothesis that the Texas AHB population is the source of gAHB in Puerto Rico.© 2019 The Authors.

Climatological factors may also alter the dynamics of the interactions between plant pathogens and their hosts.  (=) , the causal agent of Swiss needle cast (SNC) of Douglas-fir, is endemic to western North America where it exists as two sympatric, reproductively isolated lineages. The abundance of this fungus and the severity of SNC are strongly influenced by climate. We used statistical and population genetic analyses to examine relationships between environment, pathogen population structure, and SNC severity. Although  Lineage 2 in western Oregon and Washington was most abundant where SNC symptoms were most severe, we did not detect a significant relationship between Lineage 2 and disease severity. Warmer winter temperatures were inversely correlated with foliage retention () and positively correlated with the relative abundance of Lineage 2 (). However when distance inland, which was strongly correlated with both  and , was included in the model, there was no significant relationship between Lineage 2 and . Spring/early summer dew point temperatures also were positively associated with total  abundance ( index ()) and inversely correlated with . Warmer summer mean temperatures were associated with lower  and higher . Our results suggest that the two lineages have overlapping environmental optima, but slightly different tolerance ranges. Lineage 2 was absent from more inland sites where winters are colder and summers are warm and dry, while Lineage 1 occurred at most sites across an environmental gradient suggesting broader environmental tolerance. These relationships suggest that climate influences the abundance and distribution of this ecologically important plant pathogen and may have played a role in the evolutionary divergence of these two cryptic fungal lineages.© 2019 The Authors.

Epidemiological studies have linked perinatal antibiotic exposure in human newborns to an increased risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but if this effect is mediated by the gut-lung axis is unknown. To explore antibiotic disruption of the newborn gut-lung axis, we studied how perinatal maternal antibiotic exposure influenced lung injury in a hyperoxia-based mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We report that disruption of intestinal commensal  during the perinatal period promotes a more severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia phenotype characterized by increased mortality and pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanistically, metagenomic shifts were associated with decreased IL-22 expression in bronchoalveolar lavage and were independent of hyperoxia-induced inflammasome activation.

Phytohormones, root exudates, and volatiles are important factors regulating the host-AM fungi interaction. However, the effects of phytohormones, root exudates, and volatiles on asymbiotic (without roots present) or pre-symbiotic (with roots present but no ) sporulation of AM fungi are unexplored. In this study, we tested the asymbiotic sporulation of Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM 197198 and further investigated the influences of abscisic acid (ABA), the exudates, and volatiles of tomato hairy roots on asymbiotic or pre-symbiotic sporulation in vitro. Results indicated that mother spores asymbiotically and pre-symbiotically produced daughter spores singly or in pairs. Compared with symbiotically produced spores, pre-symbiotically produced spores were significantly smaller (43.1 μm vs. 89.2 μm in diameter). Exogenous ABA applied to mother spores significantly increased the number of daughter spores, and root volatiles also significantly promoted pre-symbiotic sporulation. Our results provide the first evidence that exogenous ABA can promote AM fungal asymbiotic and pre-symbiotic sporulation, which highlights the potential role of phytohormones in AM fungal propagation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649634>Yeasts of Burden: Exploring the Mycobiome-Bacteriome of the Piglet GI Tract.</a></h2><p>Interactions between the bacteria and fungi in the gut microbiome can result in altered nutrition, pathogenicity of infection, and host development, making them a crucial component in host health. Associations between the mycobiome and bacteriome in the piglet gut, in the context of weaning, remain unknown. Weaning is a time of significant stress, dietary changes, microbial alterations, and a predisposition to infection. The loss of animal health and growth makes potential microbial interventions of interest to the swine industry. Recent studies have demonstrated the diversity and development of the microbiome in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of piglets during weaning, resulting from the dietary and physiological changes. Despite these advances, the role of the mycobiota in piglet health and its contribution to overall microbiome development remains mostly unknown. In this study we investigated the bacteriome and the mycobiome after weaning in the GI tract organs and feces from 35-day old piglets. Following weaning, the α-diversity and amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) counts of the bacteriome increased, proximally to distally, from the stomach to the feces along the GI tract, while the mycobiome α-diversity and ASV counts were highest in the porcine stomach. β-diversity analyses show distinct clusters based on organ type in the bacteriome and mycobiome, but dispersion remained relatively constant in the mycobiome between organ/fecal sites. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Epsilonbacteraeota were the most abundant bacterial phyla present in the GI tract and feces based on mean taxonomic composition with high variation of composition found in the stomach. In the mycobiome, the dominant phyla were Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, and the stomach mycobiome did not demonstrate the same high level of variation observed in the bacteriome. Potential interactions between genera were found in the lower piglet GI bacteriome and mycobiome with positive correlations found between the fungus, , and several bacterial species, including .  demonstrated negative correlations with the short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria , , and .

Lack of results of objective test, however, does not allow drawing conclusions about the effects of cultivation in the organic system and comparison to currently preferred conventional system. Field experiment was conducted in organic and conventional fields. Thirty modern cultivars of winter wheat were sown.

The intensity Fusarium head blight was at a similar level in both systems. However,   of kernels expressed as ergosterol level or DNA concentration was higher for the organic system. It did not reflect in an increased accumulation of trichothecenes in grain, which was similar in both systems, but sowing value of organically produced seeds was lower.

The selection of the individual cultivars for organic growing in terms of resistance to diseases and contamination of grain with  toxins was possible. Effects of organic growing differ significantly from the conventional and grain obtained such way can be recommended to consumers.

In case of expectant management and with a low rate of antibiotic prophylaxis, home care compared to hospitalization could be associated with an increase in neonatal infections (LE3), especially in case of group B streptococcus  (LE3). Home care is therefore not recommended (Grade C). In the absence of spontaneous labor within 12 hours of rupture, antibiotic prophylaxis could reduce the risk of maternal intrauterine infection but not of neonatal infection (LE3). Its use after 12 hours of rupture in term prelabor rupture of the membranes is therefore recommended (Grade C). When antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated, intravenous beta-lactams are recommended (Grade C). Induction of labor with oxytocin (LE1), prostaglandin E2 (LE1) or misoprostol (LE1), is associated with shorter rupture of membranes to delivery intervals when compared to expectant management. Compared with expectant management, immediate induction of labor is not associated with lower rates of neonatal infection (LE1), even among women with a positive streptococcus B vaginal swab (LE2). Thus, expectant management can be offered without increasing the risk of neonatal infection (Grade B). Induction of labor is not associated with an increase or decrease in the cesarean delivery rate (LE2), whatever parity (LE2) or Bishop score at admission (LE3). Induction can thus be proposed without increasing the risk of cesarean delivery (Grade B). No induction method (oxytocin, dinoprostone, misoprostol or Foley Catheter) has demonstrated superiority over another, whether to reduce rate of intrauterine or neonatal infection, rate of cesarean delivery or to shorten rupture of membranes to delivery intervals regardless of Bishop's score and parity.Term prelabor rupture of membranes is a frequent event. A 12-hour delay without onset of spontaneous labor was chosen to differentiate a physiological condition from a potentially unsafe situation justifying an antibiotic prophylaxis. Expectant management or induction of labor can both be proposed, even in case of positive screening for streptococcus B, depending on the patient's wishes and maternity units' organization (Professional consensus).Copyright © 2019.

However, it remains unclear how ancient lakes play roles in genetic and phenotypic diversity of freshwater mollusks. In the present study, we focus on viviparid freshwater snails in the ancient lakes of East and Southeast Asia (Japan and China) to address this question. Using molecular phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial (COI, 16S) and nuclear genes (18S, 28S, H3), we show that patterns of species diversification in viviparid lineages.  to ancient lake occurred independently in China and Japan at least four times, with subsequent diversification into more than two species within each lake group. Morphological analyses of fossil related viviparids suggest parallel phenotypic evolution occurred in the different lakes and ages. Each lake contained a single lineage, which was phenotypically diversified relative to those from other sites. Using genome-wide SNPs obtained by MIG-seq, we also examined the genetic structure of three Japanese viviparids, including two endemic species of ancient Lake Biwa. The results suggest that these two species diversified from the population of the third species living in wetlands surrounding the lake. These findings suggest that rapid diversification of lineages and phenotypic divergence can occur in ancient lakes compared to other habitats. Formation of large lakes likely promotes speciation and phenotypic divergence as a result of adaptation into different microhabitats. High numbers of ancient lakes could be a driver of species diversity in Asian viviparid snails.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618269>Metarhizium robertsii ammonium permeases (MepC and Mep2) contribute to rhizoplane  and modulates the transfer of insect derived nitrogen to plants.</a></h2><p>The endophytic insect pathogenic fungi (EIPF) Metarhizium promotes plant growth through symbiotic association and the transfer of insect-derived nitrogen. However, little is known about the genes involved in this association and the transfer of nitrogen. In this study, we assessed the involvement of six Metarhizium robertsii genes in endophytic, rhizoplane and rhizospheric  with barley roots. Two ammonium permeases (MepC and Mep2) and a urease, were selected since homologous genes in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were reported to play a pivotal role in nitrogen mobilization during plant root . Three other genes were selected on the basis on RNA-Seq data that showed high expression levels on bean roots, and these encoded a hydrophobin (Hyd3), a subtilisin-like serine protease (Pr1A) and a hypothetical protein. The root  assays revealed that the deletion of urease, hydrophobin, subtilisin-like serine protease and hypothetical protein genes had no impact on endophytic, rhizoplane and rhizospheric  at 10 or 20 days. However, the deletion of MepC resulted in significantly increased rhizoplane  at 10 days whereas ΔMep2 showed increased rhizoplane  at 20 days.

Competitive ability was estimated as survival probability under high crowding conditions based on neighborhood models.

These adhesive interactions are most effectively engendered via binding of the endothelial lectin E-selectin (CD62E) to its cognate ligand, sialyl Lewis-X (sLe), displayed on circulating cells. Though CAR T-cell immunotherapy holds promise for treatment of various hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies, there is essentially no information regarding the efficiency of CAR T-cell homing. Accordingly, we performed integrated biochemical studies and adhesion assays to examine the capacity of human CAR T-cells to engage E-selectin. Our data indicate that CAR T-cells do not express sLe and do not bind E-selectin. However, enforced sLe display can be achieved on human CAR T-cells by surface fucosylation, with resultant robust E-selectin binding under hemodynamic shear. Importantly, following intravascular administration into mice, fucosylated human CAR-T cells infiltrate marrow with 10-fold higher efficiency than do unfucosylated cells.

Nevertheless, a previous HSV vaccine candidate did have partial success in preventing genital herpes and HSV acquisition and another immunotherapeutic candidate reduced viral shedding and recurrent lesions, inspiring further research. However, the entry pathway of HSV into the anogenital mucosa and the subsequent cascade of immune responses need further elucidation so that these responses could be mimicked or improved by a vaccine, to prevent viral entry and  of the neuronal ganglia. For an effective novel vaccine against genital herpes the choice of antigen and adjuvant may be critical. The incorporation of adjuvants of the vaccine candidates in the past, may account for their partial efficacy. It is likely that they can be improved by understanding the mechanisms of immune responses elicited by different adjuvants and comparing these to natural immune responses. Here we review the history of vaccines for HSV, those in development and compare them to successful vaccines for chicken pox or herpes zoster. We also review what is known of the natural immune control of herpes lesions, via interacting innate immunity and CD4 and CD8 T cells and the lessons they provide for development of new, more effective vaccines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636183>Host-symbiont specificity determined by microbe-microbe competition in an insect gut.</a></h2><p>Despite the omnipresence of specific host-symbiont associations with acquisition of the microbial symbiont from the environment, little is known about how the specificity of the interaction evolved and is maintained. The bean bug  acquires a specific bacterial symbiont of the genus  from environmental soil and harbors it in midgut crypts. The genus  consists of over 100 species, showing ecologically diverse lifestyles, and including serious human pathogens, plant pathogens, and nodule-forming plant mutualists, as well as insect mutualists. Through infection tests of 34  species and 18 taxonomically diverse bacterial species, we demonstrate here that nonsymbiotic  and even its outgroup  could stably colonize the gut symbiotic organ and provide beneficial effects to the bean bug when inoculated on aposymbiotic hosts. However, coinoculation revealed that the native symbiont always outcompeted the nonnative bacteria inside the gut symbiotic organ, explaining the predominance of the native  symbiont in natural bean bug populations. Hence, the abilities for  and cooperation, usually thought of as specific traits of mutualists, are not unique to the native  symbiont but, to the contrary, competitiveness inside the gut is a derived trait of the native symbiont lineage only and was thus critical in the evolution of the insect gut symbiont.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635929>Diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia by real-time PCR in patients with various underlying diseases.</a></h2><p>Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a disease caused by the opportunistic infection of the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii. Several PCR methods have been developed to aid in the diagnosis of PCP. In this study, we evaluated the performance of a real-time PCR in the diagnosis of PCP, in patients with various underlying diseases.Ninety-seven BAL samples and 94 sputum samples from 191 patients were used in the study. Patients were classified as PCP (121 patients) or non-PCP (70 patients) based on their clinical and radiological presentations.Real time PCR amplified the P. jirovecii mitochondrial large-subunit rRNA gene with a detection limit of 68 copies of DNA per reaction. Non-PCP pathogens including 32 different fungi and bacteria were also evaluated. Overall, 71.9% of the samples from PCP patients and 14.5% of those from non-PCP patients were positive for the PCR test with a C value of the real-time PCR below 45. The main underlying diseases of the patients were hematological or solid malignancies (47.1%) and HIV infection (8.9%). The C values of the test were significantly lower in BAL samples from PCP patients than those from non-PCP patients (p = 0.024). No non-PCP patient had a C value below 30, whereas samples from 24.8% of PCP patients with underlying diseases had a C value below 30.Since false positive PCR results were obtained, perhaps due to , we suggest that the diagnosis of PCP should be based on a combination of clinical symptoms, underlying diseases, and PCR results.Copyright © 2019.

However, our knowledge of how nasal  impacts on the lung cells, especially on the predominant alveolar macrophage (AM) population, is limited.Using a Controlled Human Infection Model to achieve nasal  with 6B serotype, we investigated the effect of Spn  on lung cells.We collected bronchoalveolar lavages from healthy pneumococcal challenged participants aged 18-49 years. Confocal microscopy, molecular and classical microbiology were used to investigate microaspiration and pneumococcal presence in the lower airways. AM opsonophagocytic capacity was assessed by functional assays in vitro, whereas flow cytometry and transcriptomic analysis were used to assess further changes on the lung cellular populations.AM from Spn-colonized exhibited increased opsonophagocytosis to pneumococcus (11.4% median increase) for four months after clearance of experimental pneumococcal . AM had also increased responses against other bacterial pathogens. Pneumococcal DNA detected in the BAL samples of Spn-colonized were positively correlated with nasal pneumococcal density (r=0.71, p=0.029). Similarly, AM heightened opsonophagocytic capacity was correlated with nasopharyngeal pneumococcal density (r=0.61, p=0.025).Our findings demonstrate that nasal  with pneumococcus and microaspiration prime AM, leading to brisker responsiveness to both pneumococcus and unrelated bacterial pathogens. The relative abundance of AM in the alveolar spaces, alongside with their potential for non-specific protection, render them an attractive target for novel vaccines.

This interaction has not been fully considered in many previous studies which used controlled experiments with agronomic or model plant species. Here, we investigated this interaction in a naturally occurring forb (a locoweed species) , its symbiotic endophyte , and the mycotoxin swainsonine. Host genetic variation was characterized by microsatellite markers. Endophyte infection rate and swainsonine levels were determined by PCR and HPLC, respectively. Genetic markers defined two distinct host populations and revealed that host genetics were significantly correlated with geographical location, elevation, and precipitation. As the host diverged, symbiotic interactions were reduced or failed to produce detectable swainsonine in one host population. Host genotype and precipitation had a significant impact in shaping swainsonine production at the population level.

Elaborate Ca regulatory networks have been well characterized in eukaryotic cells, where Ca regulates a number of essential cellular processes, ranging from cell division, transport and motility, to apoptosis and pathogenesis. However, in bacteria, the knowledge on Ca signaling is still fragmentary. This is complicated by the large variability of environments that bacteria inhabit with diverse levels of Ca. Yet another complication arises when bacterial pathogens invade a host and become exposed to different levels of Ca that (1) are tightly regulated by the host, (2) control host defenses including immune responses to bacterial infections, and (3) become impaired during diseases. The invading pathogens evolved to recognize and respond to the host Ca, triggering the molecular mechanisms of adhesion, biofilm formation, host cellular damage, and host-defense resistance, processes enabling the development of persistent infections. In this review, we discuss: (1) Ca as a determinant of a host environment for invading bacterial pathogens, (2) the role of Ca in regulating main events of host  and bacterial virulence, and (3) the molecular mechanisms of Ca signaling in bacterial pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636946>Infection in patchy populations: Contrasting pathogen invasion success and dispersal at varying times since host .</a></h2><p>Repeated extinction and recolonization events generate a landscape of host populations that vary in their time since . Within this dynamic landscape, pathogens that excel at invading recently colonized host populations are not necessarily those that perform best in host populations at or near their carrying capacity, potentially giving rise to divergent selection for pathogen traits that mediate the invasion process. Rarely, however, has this contention been empirically tested. Using , we explored how differences in the  history of a host population influence the invasion success of different genotypes of the pathogen . By partitioning the pathogen invasion process into a series of individual steps, we show that each pathogen optimizes invasion differently when encountering host populations that vary in their time since . All pathogen genotypes were more likely to establish successfully in recently colonized host populations, but the production of transmission spores was typically maximized in either the subsequent growth or stationary phase of host . Integrating across the first three pathogen invasion steps (initial establishment, proliferation, and secondary infection) revealed that overall pathogen invasion success (and its variance) was, nonetheless, highest in recently colonized host populations. However, only pathogens that were slow to kill their host were able to maximize host-facilitated dispersal. This suggests that only a subset of pathogen genotypes-the less virulent and more dispersive-are more likely to encounter newly colonized host populations at the front of a range expansion or in metapopulations with high extinction rates. Our results suggest a fundamental trade-off for a pathogen between dispersal and virulence, and evidence for higher invasion success in younger host populations, a finding with clear implications for pathogen evolution in spatiotemporally dynamic settings.© 2019 The Author(s).

While it is known that > 80% of pig farmers are colonized with LA-MRSA, only few studies assessed the situation for humans with occasional livestock contact. Recently it was shown that over 75% of scientific field workers visiting pigsties were temporarily carrying LA-MRSA.To find out whether they were transiently or permanently colonized, we used whole genome sequencing (WGS) data to analyze the relatedness of isolates from these recurrently LA-MRSA-positive field workers and from corresponding pigsties. Sequences were analyzed using  typing (, cgMLST) and the BEAST software package was used to examine phylogeny.In total, 81 samples from three field workers on eight different pigsties over a period of 2.5 years were sequenced. All isolates belonged to  types t011, t034 or t2011 with different types found in the same field worker at different time points. Analysis of cgMLST revealed nine genotypic clusters, mostly correlating with the pigsty on which they were sampled. Field worker isolates clustered with the samples from farms that were visited on the same day. BEAST analysis corroborated the cgMLST-based clustering and suggests an origin of the lineage about 22 years ago.We conclude that nasal LA-MRSA  among humans with occasional livestock contact is common but most likely only temporary. Furthermore, we showed that the Western German LA-MRSA CC398 originated in the late 1990s and diversified into farm-specific genotypes, which stay relatively consistent over time.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662046>. in Loggerhead Sea Turtles (): From  to Infection.</a></h2><p>With the aim of evaluating the presence of . in sea turtles with and without lesions and assessing the risk factors favoring  and/or infection, 74 loggerhead sea turtles () admitted to rescue and rehabilitation clinics in Italy were analyzed.

The most common methods use microscopic estimates of the relative proportion of root length colonized by fungal structures. These methods typically examine root subsamples. While such methods are inexpensive and relatively simple, significant variation within single root system means there is opportunity for sampling bias. We evaluated the two most common methods of percent root length  for AM fungi both as a subsample and for the entire root system of flax plants. We compared these measures to a novel technique that returns projected fungal surface area (fungal coverage), by using microphotography and imaging analysis. Both microscopic methods overestimated the  intensity compared to image analysis. Among the microscopic methods, the method which incorporated  intensity (Trouvelot) was significantly more similar to imaging method results, than the method that is based on the presence/absence of the fungus (McGonigle).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is not the case for non-mutualistic beneficial interactions or associative symbiosis with plants. Particularly, little is known about the transcriptional regulations associated with the immune tolerance of plants towards beneficial microbes. In this context, the study of the  rice model is very promising to describe the molecular mechanisms involved in associative symbiosis. Indeed, several species of the  () genus can colonize rice tissues and have beneficial effects; particularly, two species have been thoroughly studied:  and . This study aims to compare the interaction of these species with rice and especially to identify common or specific plant responses. Therefore, we analyzed root  of the rice cultivar Nipponbare using DsRed-tagged bacterial strains and produced the transcriptomes of both roots and leaves 7 days after root inoculation. This led us to the identification of a co-expression jasmonic acid (JA)-related network exhibiting opposite regulation in response to the two strains in the leaves of inoculated plants. We then monitored by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) the expression of JA-related genes during time course  by each strain. Our results reveal a temporal shift in this JA systemic response, which can be related to different  strategies of both strains.Copyright © 2019 King, Wallner, Rimbault, Barrachina, Klonowska, Moulin and Czernic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611279> serovar Typhimurium use PbgA/YejM to regulate lipopolysaccharide assembly during bacteremia.</a></h2><p> serovar Typhimurium ( Typhimurium) rely upon the inner-membrane protein, PbgA, to enhance outer-membrane (OM) integrity and promote virulence in mice.

Studies on the prevalence of Blastocystis in HIV-positive patients are limited and dated.A cross-sectional study was carried out involving 156 HIV-positive patients to evaluate the prevalence of Blastocystis-subtypes by molecular amplification and sequencing the small subunit rRNA gene (SSU rDNA), to identify the risk factors for its transmission, to examine the relationship between the presence of the protist and gastrointestinal disorders. Furthermore, the evaluation of the faecal calprotectin by immunoassay from a sample of subjects was performed to evaluate the gut inflammation in Blastocystis-carriers.Blastocystis-subtypes ST1, ST2, ST3, ST4 were identified in 39 HIV-positive patients (25%). No correlation was found between the presence of the protist and virological or epidemiological risk factors. Blastocystis was more frequently detected in homosexual subjects (p = 0.037) infected by other enteric protozoa (p = 0.0001) and with flatulence (p = 0.024). No significant differences in calprotectin level was found between Blastocystis-carriers and free ones.Blastocystis is quite common in HIV-positive patients on ART showing in examined patients 25% prevalence.

However, the mechanisms of severe pneumonia with postinfluenza Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) secondary infection have not been fully understood. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of pneumonia in postinfluenza A virus (IAV) infection via a mouse model. Mice were intranasally inoculated with SP three days after IAV inoculation. We then collected samples at three time points to dynamically observe the pathological progression. In IAV infection alone, lymphocyte infiltration and widened alveolar intervals were observed. In the blood, levels of the CD19+, CD19+CD21+ and CD19+CD79β+B lymphocyte subpopulations were reduced, and IFN-γ and IL-10 were elevated. Slight atrophy was seen in the spleen, which was due to splenic B lymphocyteinitiated apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. When SP infection occurred after IAV infection, the pulmonary inflammation was significantly aggravated; a fair number of lymphocytes and neutrophils infiltrated simultaneously with exfoliated bronchial epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, widened alveolar septum and hemorrhaging. Increasing edema fluid and bacteria accumulated in the alveolar cavity. Decreased CD19+, CD19+CD21+ and CD19+CD79β+B lymphocyte subpopulations and increased interferon gamma (IFN-γ) or interleukin 10 (IL-10) were more prominent compared to those with viral infection alone. Spleen atrophy resulting from coinfection was more obvious because of massive splenic B lymphocyte apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway compared to viral infection alone. This study shows that although inflammation caused by SP infection alone was temporary, preceding IAV infection provided favorable conditions for SP  and multiplication by destroying lung structure and suppressing humoral immunity. Synergistic IAV-SP coinfection is likely to facilitate more SP  and promote B lymphocyte-suppression and reduction.

The antimicrobial efficacy of such biomaterials can be increased by surface enhancement (nanosilver) or by creating a sacrificial anode system for Ag. Such a system will lead to an electrochemically driven enhanced Ag ion release due to the presence of a more noble metal. Here we combined the enlarged surface of nanoparticles (NP) with a possible sacrificial anode effect for Ag induced by the presence of the electrochemically more noble platinum (Pt) in physical mixtures of Ag NP and Pt NP dispersions. These Ag NP/Pt NP mixtures were compared to the same amounts of pure Ag NP in terms of cell biological responses, i.e. the antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli as well as the viability of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). In addition, Ag NP was analyzed by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. It was found that the dissolution rate of Ag NP was enhanced in the presence of Pt NP within the physical mixture compared to a dispersion of pure Ag NP. Dissolution experiments revealed a fourfold increased Ag ion release from physical mixtures due to enhanced electrochemical activity, which resulted in a significantly increased toxicity towards both bacteria and hMSC. Thus, our results provide evidence for an underlying sacrificial anode mechanism induced by the presence of Pt NP within physical mixtures with Ag NP. Such physical mixtures have a high potential for various applications, for example as antimicrobial implant coatings in the biomedicine or as bactericidal systems for water and surface purification in the technical area.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651305>Comparing methods to estimate incremental inpatient costs and length of stay due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Alberta, Canada.</a></h2><p>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an opportunistic bacterial organism resistant to first line antibiotics. Acquisition of MRSA is often classified as either healthcare-associated or community-acquired. It has been shown that both healthcare-associated and community-acquired infections contribute to the spread of MRSA within healthcare facilities. The objective of this study was to estimate the incremental inpatient cost and length of stay for individuals colonized or infected with MRSA. Common analytical methods were compared to ensure the quality of the estimate generated. This study was performed at Alberta Ministry of Health (Edmonton, Alberta), with access to clinical MRSA data collected at two Edmonton hospitals, and ministerial administrative data holdings.A retrospective cohort study of patients with MRSA was identified using a provincial infection prevention and control database. A coarsened exact matching algorithm, and two regression models (semilogarithmic ordinary least squares model and log linked generalized linear model) were evaluated. A MRSA-free cohort from the same facilities and care units was identified for the matched method; all records were used for the regression models. Records span from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2015, for individuals 18 or older at discharge.Of the models evaluated, the generalized linear model was found to perform the best. Based on this model, the incremental inpatient costs associated with hospital-acquired cases were the most costly at $31,686 (14,169 - 60,158) and $47,016 (23,125 - 86,332) for  and infection, respectively. Community-acquired MRSA cases also represent a significant burden, with incremental inpatient costs of $7397 (2924 - 13,180) and $14,847 (8445 - 23,207) for  and infection, respectively. All costs are adjusted to 2016 Canadian dollars. Incremental length of stay followed a similar pattern, where hospital-acquired infections had the longest incremental stays of 35.2 (16.3-69.5) days and community-acquired  had the shortest incremental stays of 3.0 (0.6-6.3) days.MRSA, and in particular, hospital-acquired MRSA, places a significant but preventable cost burden on the Alberta healthcare system. Estimates of cost and length of stay varied by the method of analysis and source of infection, highlighting the importance of selecting the most appropriate method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654686>Spray-drying of inhalable, multifunctional formulations for the treatment of biofilms formed in cystic fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a serious lung disease, commonly susceptible to Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The dense mucus together with biofilm formation limit drug permeability and prevent the drug from reaching the site of action, causing treatment failure of the bacterial infection. Besides the use of antibiotics, the mucolytic agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is recommended to be co-administered in the treatment of CF. Although several formulations have been developed for inhalation therapy to improve the pulmonary condition in CF patients, there is still no comprehensive study on a combined multifunctional dry powder formulation of antibiotics with NAC. In this work, we developed an innovative multifunctional dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulation based on salt formation between NAC and antibiotics and characterized their solid state properties and physical stability. NAC could be spray dried together with three different antibiotics, azithromycin (Azi), tobramycin (Tobra) and ciprofloxacin (Cipro), without the use of organic solvents to form Azi/NAC, Tobra/NAC and Cipro/NAC DPI formulations. Solid-state characterization of these DPI formulations showed that they were amorphous after spray drying. Azi/NAC and Tobra/NAC form co-amorphous salt systems that were physically stable under storage at stress conditions. For particle characterization, the obtained mass median aerodynamic diameters were in a suitable range for inhalation (< 5.0μm). The multifunctional antibiotic/NAC formulations conserved or improved the antibiotic susceptibility and showed promising results regarding the inhibition of P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilm formation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Most members of the root microbiome possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host immunity and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root microbiota, including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [5, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root microbiome. In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic acid and its derivative 2-keto gluconic acid. Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic acids and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic acid-mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root immunity. Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root microbiome, as it facilitates  by beneficial root microbiota.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we show that the development of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells relies on a specific temporal window, after which MAIT cell development is permanently impaired. This imprinting depends on early-life exposure to defined microbes that synthesize riboflavin-derived antigens. In adults, cutaneous MAIT cells are a dominant population of interleukin-17A (IL-17A)-producing lymphocytes, which display a distinct transcriptional signature and can subsequently respond to skin commensals in an IL-1-, IL-18-, and antigen-dependent manner. Consequently, local activation of cutaneous MAIT cells promotes wound healing. Together, our work uncovers a privileged interaction between defined members of the microbiota and MAIT cells, which sequentially controls both tissue-imprinting and subsequent responses to injury.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Populations farther from this refugium have smaller effective sizes and fewer rare alleles. They also displayed elevated heterosis in among-population crosses, reflecting the accumulation of deleterious mutations during range expansion. Although populations with elevated heterosis had reduced segregating mutation load, the magnitude of inbreeding depression lacked geographic pattern. The ability to self-fertilize was strongly positively correlated with the distance from the refugium and mutation accumulation-a pattern that contrasts sharply with contemporary mate and pollinator limitation. In this and other species, diversity in sexual systems may reflect the legacy of evolution in small, colonizing populations, with little or no relation to the ecology of modern populations.© 2019 The Author(s).

These interactions take place in a highly complex chemical landscape, the intestinal eco-active chemosphere, composed of chemical substances that positively or negatively influence bacterial growth, including those originated from nutrient uptake, and those produced by the action of the human or animal host and the intestinal microbiome. The contribution of bacteria results from their effect on the host generated molecules, on food and digested food, and organic substances from microbial origin, including from bacterial degradation. Here, we comprehensively review the main chemical substances present in the human intestinal chemosphere, particularly of those having inhibitory effects on microorganisms. With this background, and focusing on , the most relevant human pathogens from the intestinal microbiota, the microcin's history and classification, mechanisms of action, and mechanisms involved in microcin's immunity (in microcin producers) and resistance (non-producers) are reviewed. Products from the chemosphere likely modulate the ecological effects of microcin activity. Several cross-resistance mechanisms are shared by microcins, colicins, bacteriophages, and some conventional antibiotics, which are expected to produce cross-effects. Double-microcin-producing strains (such as microcins MccM and MccH47) have been successfully used for decades in the control of pathogenic gut organisms. Microcins are associated with successful gut , facilitating translocation and invasion, leading to bacteremia, and urinary tract infections. In fact,  strains from the more invasive phylogroups (e.g., B2) are frequently microcinogenic. A publicly accessible APD3 database http://aps.unmc.edu/AP/ shows particular genes encoding microcins in 34.1% of .  strains (mostly MccV, MccM, MccH47, and MccI47), and much less in  and  (<2%). Some 4.65% of  are microcinogenic (mostly with MccE492), and even less in  or  (mostly MccS). The high frequency and variety of microcins in some  indicate key ecological functions, a notion supported by their dominance in the intestinal microbiota of biosynthetic gene clusters involved in the synthesis of post-translationally modified peptide microcins.Copyright © 2019 Baquero, Lanza, Baquero, del Campo and Bravo-Vázquez.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618301>Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in the upper and lower airways of a child with cystic fibrosis: a father's meticulous approach to successful eradication.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611898>Ramf: An Open-Source R Package for Statistical Analysis and Display of Quantitative Root  by Arbuscular Mycorrhiza Fungi.</a></h2><p>Data analysis and graphical representation form an essential part of scientific research dissemination.

Although mutations in genes of the head ontogenetic program have been reported, many cases remain unexplained. Head dysgenesis has also been related to trisomy or amplification of the chromosomal region overlapping the CDX2 homeobox gene, a master element of the trunk ontogenetic program. Hence, we investigated the repercussion on head morphogenesis of the imbalance between the head and trunk ontogenetic programs, by means of ectopic rostral expression of CDX2 at gastrulation. This caused severe malformations affecting the forebrain and optic structures, and also the frontonasal process associated with defects in neural crest cells . These malformations are the result of the downregulation of genes of the head program together with the abnormal induction of trunk program genes. Together, these data indicate that the imbalance between the anterior and posterior ontogenetic programs in embryos is a new possible cause of head dysgenesis during human development, linked to defects in setting up anterior neuroectodermal structures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666782>Nasal and Hand Carriage Rate of  among Food Handlers Working in Jimma Town, Southwest Ethiopia.</a></h2><p>Food handlers have been recognized to play a major role in the transmission of food borne diseases, contributing significantly to the global incidence and burden of the diseases. This study, therefore, aimed to assess the nasal and hand carriage of Staphylococcus aureus among food handlers in Jimma Town.A community based cross sectional study was conducted from February to May 2017. Swab specimens from nasopharyngeal and hands of food handlers working in food establishments were collected for isolation and identification of S. aureus using standard bacteriological methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was done using disc diffusion method. Associations of selected variables for S. aureus  were determined using SPSS version 20 with p ≤ 0.05 taken as statistically significant.Among the 300 food handlers working in hotels and restaurants in Jimma Town, 86(28.7%) were colonized by S. aureus. The frequency of isolation of S. aureus from nose, hand and both parts (nose and hand) were 27(9%), 34(11.3%) and 25(8.3%), respectively. There was strong association (P=0.00336) between carriage rate of S. aureus and food handlers' job category. The majority (90.7%) of the isolates were resistant to Penicillin and Ampicillin. Increased levels of sensitivity were observed against Ciprofloxacin (96.5%), Cefoxitin (95.3%) and Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid (94.2%).This study revealed a high prevalence of S. aureus carriers among food handlers and high antibacterial resistance towards commonly prescribed drugs, justifying the screening of food handlers to detect and treat carriers and protect restaurant customers from staphylococcal food poisoning.© 2019 Getenet Beyene, et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652382>The effects of diadromy and its loss on genomic divergence: the case of amphidromous Galaxias maculatus populations.</a></h2><p>Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that affect the genetic divergence between diadromous and resident populations across heterogeneous environments is a challenging task. While diadromy may promote gene flow leading to a lack of genetic differentiation among populations, resident populations tend to be affected by local adaptation and/or plasticity. Studies on these effects on genomic divergence in non-model amphidromous species are scarce. Galaxias maculatus, one of the most widespread fish species in the Southern Hemisphere, exhibits two life histories, an ancestral diadromous, specifically, amphidromous form and a derived freshwater resident form. We examined the genetic diversity and divergence among 20 estuarine and resident populations across the Chilean distribution of G. maculatus and assessed the extent to which selection is involved in the differentiation among resident populations. We obtained nearly 4400 SNP markers using a RADcap approach for 224 individuals. As expected, collections from estuarine locations typically consist of diadromous individuals. Diadromous populations are highly differentiated from their resident counterparts by both neutral and putative adaptive markers. While diadromous populations exhibit high gene flow and lack site fidelity, resident populations appear to be the product of different  events with relatively low genetic diversity and varying levels of gene flow. In particular, the northernmost resident populations were clearly genetically distinct and reproductively isolated from each other suggesting local adaptation. Our study provides insights into the role of life history differences in the maintenance of genetic diversity and the importance of genetic divergence in species evolution.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615961>Remasking of Candida albicans β-Glucan in Response to Environmental pH Is Regulated by Quorum Sensing.</a></h2><p> is a commensal yeast of the human gut which is tolerated by the immune system but has the potential to become an opportunistic pathogen. One way in which  achieves this duality is through concealing or exposing cell wall pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in response to host-derived environment cues (pH, hypoxia, and lactate).

Remasking of β-glucan was mediated via the cell density-dependent fungal quorum sensing molecule farnesol, while chitin remasking was mediated via a small, heat-stable, nonproteinaceous secreted molecule(s).

However, the tissue-specific factors controlling this dialogue remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that T cell responses to commensal  are associated with the development of organized cellular clusters within the skin epithelium. These organized lymphocyte clusters are surrounded by keratinocytes expressing a discrete program associated with antigen presentation and antimicrobial defense. Notably, IL-22-mediated keratinocyte-intrinsic MHC class II expression was required for the selective accumulation of commensal-induced IFN-γ, but not IL-17A-producing CD4 T cells within the skin. Taking these data together, this work uncovers an unexpected role for MHC class II expression by keratinocytes in the control of homeostatic type 1 responses to the microbiota.

It also enlightens our understanding on the host-microbe interactions within the physiological context of a living host. However, the responses of GF zebrafish to various  conditions such as bacterial concentrations,  time points, and exposure duration remain unclear. To address this issue, we explored the responses of GF zebrafish by using two bacterial species at varying concentrations,  time points and exposure duration. Therefore, we mono-associated GF zebrafish with  DH5α or  WB800N at concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml either at 3 day post fertilization (dpf) or 5 dpf for 24 or 48 h. We evaluated the responses of GF zebrafish by analyzing the survival rate,  efficiency, nutrients metabolism, intestinal cell proliferation, innate immunity, stress, and behavior responses by comparing it to conventionally raised zebrafish (CONR) and GF zebrafish. The results indicated that the final bacteria concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml did not cause any mortality when GF mono-associated larvae were exposed to either  DH5α or  WB800N at 3 or 5 dpf, while concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml increased the mortality, particularly for 5 dpf owing to the decrease in dissolved oxygen level. The  DH5α mainly induced the expression of genes related to nutrients metabolism, cell proliferation and immunity, while  WB800N mainly upregulated the expression of genes related to immunity and stress responses. Moreover, our data revealed that GF zebrafish showed higher levels of physical activity than CONR and the microbial  reduced the hyperactivity of GF zebrafish, suggesting  of bacteria affected behavior characteristics.

The influence of starvation-associated stress on the behavior of non-toxin-producing strains of  serotype O157:H7 and serotypes O26, O103, O111, and O145 was examined subsequent to their introduction to the phyllosphere of field-grown romaine lettuce as inocula simulating starved (96 h in sterile deionized water) and nutrient-depleted (24 h broth culture) cells.

Yet, whether mycorrhizae affect traits important to pollination remains poorly understood and may depend on the match between host and fungal genotypes. Here, we examined how ericoid mycorrhizal fungi affected flowering phenology, floral traits, and reproductive success, among eight genotypes of highbush blueberry, Vaccinium corymbosum (Ericaceae). We asked three overarching questions: (1) Do genotypes differ in response to inoculation? (2) How does inoculation affect floral and flowering traits? (3) Are inoculated plants more attractive to pollinators and less pollen limited than non-inoculated plants of the same genotype?To examine these questions, we experimentally inoculated plants with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi, grew the plants in the field, and measured flowering and floral traits over 2 years. In year 2, we conducted a hand-pollination experiment to test whether plants differed in pollen limitation.Inoculated plants had significantly higher levels of  for some genotypes, and there were significant floral trait changes in inoculated plants for some genotypes as well. On average, inoculated plants produced significantly larger floral displays, more fruits per inflorescence, and heavier fruits with lower sugar content, than non-inoculated, control plants. Hand pollination enhanced the production of fruits, and fruit mass, for non-inoculated plants but not for those that were inoculated.Our results demonstrate that inoculation with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi enhanced flowering and altered investment in reproduction in genotype-specific ways.

Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying microbiota engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and (2) patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from 5 individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in microbiota induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial  was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status.

Antibiotic resistant infections disproportionately affect those with immunocompromising conditions, chronic , and frequent antibiotic use such as transplant patients or those with cystic fibrosis. However, clinicians lack the diagnostic tools to confidently diagnose and treat infections, leading to widespread use of empiric broad spectrum antimicrobials, often for prolonged duration.A 22 year-old Caucasian female with cystic fibrosis received a bilateral orthotopic lung transplantation 5 months prior to the index hospitalization. She underwent routine surveillance bronchoscopy and was admitted for post-procedure fever. A clear cause of infection was not identified by routine methods. Imaging and bronchoscopic lung biopsy did not identify an infectious agent or rejection. She was treated with a prolonged course of antimicrobials targeting known colonizing organisms from prior bronchoalveolar lavage cultures (Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aureus, and Aspergillus). However, we identified Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in two independent whole blood samples using direct-pathogen sequencing, which was not identified by other methods.This case represents a common clinical conundrum: identification of infection in a high-risk, complex patient. Here, direct-pathogen sequencing identified a pathogen that would not otherwise have been identified by common techniques. Had results been clinically available, treatment could have been customized, avoiding a prolonged course of broad spectrum antimicrobials that would only exacerbate resistance.

Understanding how this pathogen responds to the environmental changes and adapts to different niches found inside the host might contribute to gain insight into bacterial pathogenesis. Comparative analyses of previous transcriptomic and proteomic data suggested that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms modulate B. pertussis virulence in response to iron availability. Iron scarcity represents one of the major stresses faced by bacterial pathogens inside the host. In this study, we used gel-free nanoLC-MS/MS-based proteomics to investigate whether Hfq, a highly conserved post-transcriptional regulatory protein, is involved in B. pertussis adaptation to low iron environment. To this end, we compared the protein profiles of wild type B. pertussis and its isogenic hfq deletion mutant strain under iron-replete and iron-depleted conditions. Almost of 33% of the proteins identified under iron starvation was found to be Hfq-dependent. Among them, proteins involved in oxidative stress tolerance and virulence factors that play a key role in the early steps of host  and bacterial persistence inside the host cells. Altogether these results suggest that Hfq shapes the infective phenotype of B. pertussis. SIGNIFICANCE: In the last years, it became evident that post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in ba cteria plays a central role in host-pathogen interactions. Hfq is a bacterial protein that regulates gene expression at post-transcriptional level found pivotal in the establishment of successful infections. In this study, we investigated the role of Hfq in Bordetella pertussis response to iron starvation, one of the main stresses imposed by the host. The data demonstrate that Hfq regulates the abundance of a significant number of B. pertussis proteins in response to iron starvation. Among them, virulence factors and proteins involved in oxidative stress tolerance, key players in host  and intracellular bacterial survival. Altogether, our results suggest a relevant role of Hfq in B. pertussis adaptation to the different niches found inside the host eventually granting bacterial pathogenesis.Copyright © 2018.

Despite increasing isolation of degradative microorganisms from e-waste contaminated environments, the mechanisms underlying their adaptive evolution in such habitats remain unclear. Sphingomonads generally have xenobiotic-degrading ability and may play important roles in bioremediation.  C1, characterized with superior cell surface hydrophobicity, was recently isolated from e-waste contaminated river sediment. To dissect the mechanisms driving its adaptive evolution, we evaluated its stress resistance, sequenced its genome and performed comparative genomic analysis with 19 other  strains. Strain C1 can feed on several kinds of e-waste-derived xenobiotics, exhibits a great resistance to heavy metals and possesses a high  ability. It harbors abundant genes involved in environmental adaptation, some of which are intrinsic prior to experiencing e-waste contamination. The extensive genomic variations between strain C1 and other  strains, numerous C1-unique genes, massive mobile elements and frequent genome rearrangements reflect a high genome plasticity. Positive selection, gene duplication, and especially horizontal gene transfer drive the adaptive evolution of strain C1. Moreover, presence of type IV secretion systems may allow strain C1 to be a source of beneficial genes for surrounding microorganisms. This study provides new insights into the adaptive evolution of sphingomonads, and potentially guides bioremediation strategies.Copyright © 2019 Song, Chen, Xu, Hai, Zhou, Tian, Van Nostrand, Kempher, Guo, Sun and Zhou.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632412>Bifidobacterial Dialogue With Its Human Host and Consequent Modulation of the Immune System.</a></h2><p>Since bifidobacteria are among the pioneering colonizers of the human infant gut, their interaction with their host is believed to start soon following birth. Several members of the  genus are purported to exert various health-promoting effects at local and systemic levels, e.g., limiting pathogen /invasion, influencing gut homeostasis, and influencing the immune system through changes in innate and/or adaptive immune responses. This has promoted extensive research efforts to shed light on the precise mechanisms by which bifidobacteria are able to stimulate and interact with the host immune system. These studies uncovered a variety of secreted or surface-associated molecules that act as essential mediators for the establishment of a bifidobacteria-host immune system dialogue, and that allow interactions with mucosa-associated immune cells. Additionally, the by-products generated from bifidobacterial carbohydrate metabolism act as vectors that directly and indirectly trigger the host immune response, the latter by stimulating growth of other commensal microorganisms such as propionate- or butyrate-producing bacteria. This review is aimed to provide a comprehensive overview on the wide variety of strategies employed by bifidobacteria to engage with the host immune system.Copyright © 2019 Alessandri, Ossiprandi, MacSharry, van Sinderen and Ventura.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612503>Showing their mettle: Extraradical mycelia of arbuscular mycorrhizae form a metal filter to improve host Al tolerance and P nutrition.</a></h2><p>New evidence has shown that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can contribute to the aluminum (Al ) tolerance of host plants growing in acidic soils with phytotoxic levels of Al . The aim of this study was to investigate the role of AM fungi isolated from naturally occurring Al acidic soils in conferring host tolerance to Al toxicity in 3 wheat cultivars differing in Al sensitivity. The experiment was conducted in a soil-less substrate (vermiculite/perlite, 2:1, v/v) using two Al -tolerant genotypes and one Al -sensitive wheat genotype. The wheat was colonized with a consortium of AM fungi isolated from an andisol, with or without Al at a concentration of 200 μM.The wheat response to Al in the medium was dependent on both the plant genotype and AM . The benefits of the AM fungi to the wheat cultivars included an increased P concentration and relatively low Al accumulation in the plants. This was achieved through two mechanisms. First, the metal chelating capacity of the AM fungi was clear in some cultivars ('Tukan' and 'Porfiado'), in which the enhanced extraradical mycelium development was able to retain Al in the glomalin and hyphae. Second, the increased AM-induced acid phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere of the other cultivar ('Atlas 66') increased host nutrition possibly by hyphae-mediated nutrient uptake and GRSP CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the role of AM fungi in cultivar-specific Al detoxification can be achieved by increased extraradical mycelial filters and enhanced bioavailability of the host rhizosphere P.

The larvae affected by fungi are characterized by a decrease in PO and dopamine levels. In the initial stages of toxicosis and/or fungal infection (12 h posttreatment), increases in the activity of insect detoxifying enzymes (GST and EST) and acid proteases are observed after monotreatments, and these increases are suppressed after combined treatment with the fungus and avermectins. Lysozyme-like activity is also most strongly suppressed under combined treatment with the fungus and avermectins in the early stages posttreatment (12 h). Forty-eight hours posttreatment, we observe increases in GST, EST, acid proteases, and lysozyme-like activities under the influence of the fungus and/or avermectins. The larvae affected by avermectins accumulate lower levels of conidia than avermectin-free larvae. On the other hand, a burst of bacterial CFUs is observed under treatment with both the fungus and avermectins. We suggest that disturbance of the responses of the immune and detoxifying systems under the combined treatment and the development of opportunistic bacteria may be among the causes of the synergistic effect.©2019 Noskov et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656023>Dark septate endophytic fungi mitigate the effects of salt stress on cowpea plants.</a></h2><p>The association of plant with microorganisms, such as dark septate endophytic fungi, has mitigated the harmful effects of chemical, physical, and biological agents on the host. The objective of this work was to evaluate the interaction of the dark septate endophytic fungi with cowpea plants under salt stress. Endophytic fungi were isolated from Vochysia divergens root system, and molecular identification of fungi was performed by sequencing the ITS region. We selected and identified Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and Melanconiella elegans-21W2 for their ability to infect V. divergens root in vitro with development of typical dark septate fungi structures. Cowpea plants-inoculated or not inoculated with Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and M. elegans 21W2-were cultivated in 5-L pots under greenhouse conditions and submitted to four different electrical conductivities of irrigation water (1.2, 2.2, 3.6, and 5.0 dS m). The salinity caused decrease in leaf concentration of K and increased leaf concentration of calcium, sodium, and chlorine; and no influence of dark septate endophytic fungi was observed in these responses. On the other hand, root  with Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and M. elegans 21W2 resulted in improved nutrition with N and P in cowpea under salt stress, favoring the growth and rate of liquid photosynthesis.

This exquisite level of adaptation requires a robust modulation of their physiological and metabolic features. Additionally, virulence determinants, which include host invasion,  and survival despite the host's immune responses and antimicrobial therapy, must be optimally orchestrated by the pathogen at all times during infection. This can only be achieved by tight coordination of gene expression.

In the moss, Physcomitrella patens, a 3D leafy gametophore originates from filamentous cells that grow in a two-dimensional (2D) plane through a series of asymmetric cell divisions. Asymmetric cell divisions that coincide with different cell division planes and growth directions enable the developmental switch from 2D to 3D, but insights into the underlying mechanisms coordinating this switch are still incomplete. Using 2D-, 3D-imaging and image segmentation, we characterized two geometric cues, the width of the initial cell and the angle of the transition division plane, which sufficiently distinguished a gametophore initial cell from a branch initial cell. These identified cues were further confirmed in gametophore formation mutants. The identification of a fluorescent marker allowed us to successfully predict the gametophore initial cell with more than 90% accuracy before morphological changes, supporting our hypothesis that, before the transition division, parental cells of the gametophore initials possess different properties compared to branch initials. Our results suggest that the cell fate decision of the initial cell is determined in the parental cell, prior to the transition division.© 2019 The Authors New Phytologist © 2019 New Phytologist Trust.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645841>Implications of the presence of yeasts in tracheobronchial secretions of critically ill intubated patients.</a></h2><p>The presence of some microorganisms in the respiratory tract is a known risk factor for the infection of air passages; however, it is not clear whether this holds true for  spp. Thus, our objective was to determine the frequency of yeast  in the tracheobronchial secretions of critically ill intubated patients and to assess the presence of these yeasts in the infra-cuff region of the endotracheal tube (ET). Patients aged 18 years or older who had been using an endotracheal tube for 48 hours were recruited. Tracheal secretions were collected; after extubation, the ETs were cut into two fragments in the infra-cuff region. One of these fragments was placed in a solution containing antibiotics and sent to the lab for culture and identification of yeasts. The remaining fragment was fixed and subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In total, 20 patients with an average age of 73.3 years (± 13.1) participated in this study. These patients remained under endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation for an average of 6.4 (± 1.8) and 13.5 days (± 15), respectively. Of these patients, 45 % showed respiratory tract  by yeasts of the  genus, with  being the most frequently isolated species (66.7 %). Moreover, in almost 90 % of these patients, blastoconidia of the same yeast were found in the infra-cuff portion of the ET, as evidenced by SEM, strongly fixed on the ET surface. Yeasts isolated from both the infra-cuff region and the tracheobronchial secretions were susceptible to amphotericin B and fluconazole. In conclusion, our results show that the frequency of  by yeasts of the  genus in the tracheobronchial secretions of intubated patients within 48 hours is high, and that these species can also be found as a biofilm on the ET surface.Copyright © 2019 Ferreira et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649712>The Role of the Endophytic Microbiome in the Grapevine Response to Environmental Triggers.</a></h2><p>Endophytism within  represents a topic of critical relevance due to the multiple standpoints from which it can be approached and considered. From the biological and botanical perspectives, the interaction between microorganisms and perennial woody plants falls within the category of stable relationships from which the plants can benefit in multiple ways. The life cycle of the host ensures persistence in all seasons, repeated chances of contact, and consequent microbiota accumulation over time, leading to potentially high diversity compared with that of herbaceous short-lived plants. Furthermore, grapevines are agriculturally exploited, highly selected germplasms where a profound man-driven footprint has indirectly and unconsciously shaped the inner microbiota through centuries of cultivation and breeding. Moreover, since endophyte metabolism can contribute to that of the plant host and its fruits' biochemical composition, the nature of grapevine endophytic taxa identities, ecological attitudes, potential toxicity, and clinical relevance are aspects worthy of a thorough investigation. Can endophytic taxa efficiently defend grapevines by acting against pests or confer enough fitness to the plants to endure attacks? What are the underlying mechanisms that translate into this or other advantages in the hosting plant? Can endophytes partially redirect plant metabolism, and to what extent do they act by releasing active products? Is the inner microbial  necessary priming for a cascade of actions? Are there defined environmental conditions that can trigger the unleashing of key microbial phenotypes? What is the environmental role in providing the ground biodiversity by which the plant can recruit microsymbionts? How much and by what practices and strategies can these symbioses be managed, applied, and directed to achieve the goal of a better sustainable viticulture?

These bacteria colonize the xylem, where they form biofilms that block sap flow leading to characteristic wilting symptoms.

In contrast, because the earliest divergent lineage of extant land plants, i.e. Haplomitriopsida liverworts, associates only with Mucoromycotina mycobionts, recent studies suggested that those fungi are novel candidates for the earliest mycobionts. Therefore, Mucoromycotina-Haplomitriopsida association currently attracts attention as an ancient mycorrhiza-like association. However, mycobionts were identified in only 7 of 16 Haplomitriopsida species and the mycobionts diversity of this lineage is largely unclarified. To clarify the taxonomic composition of mycobionts in Haplomitriopsida, we observed MLSs in the rhizome of Haplomitrium mnioides (Haplomitriopsida), the Asian representative Haplomitriopsida species, and conducted molecular identification of mycobionts. It was recorded for the first time that Glomeromycotina and Mucoromycotina co-occur in Haplomitriopsida as mycobionts. Significantly, the arbuscule-like branching (ALB) of Glomeromycotina was newly described. As the Mucoromycotina fungi forming MLSs in H. mnioides, Endogonaceae and Densosporaceae were detected, in which size differences of hyphal swelling (HS) were found between the fungal families. This study provides a novel evidence in the MLS of Haplomitriopsida, i.e. the existence of Glomeromycotina association as well as the dominant Mucoromycotina association. In addition, since hyphal characteristics of the HS-type MLS were quite similar to those of fine endophytes (FE) of Endogonales in other bryophytes and vascular plants previously described, this MLS is suggested to be included in FE. These results suggest that Glomeromycotina and Mucoromycotina were acquired concurrently as the mycobionts by the earliest land plants evolved into arbuscular mycorrhizae and FE.

The development of infection-resistant, osteoblast-compatible biomaterials could represent an effective strategy to prevent bacterial  of implants, reducing the need for antibiotics. In this study, the widely used biomaterial titanium was functionalized with BMAP27(1-18), an α-helical cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide that retains potent staphylocidal activity when immobilized on agarose beads. A derivative bearing a short spacer with a free thiol at the N-terminus was coupled to silanized titanium disks via thiol-maleimide chemistry. Tethering was successful, as assessed by Contact angle, Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), with an average surface mass density of 456 ng/cm and a layer thickness of 3 nm. The functionalized titanium displayed antimicrobial properties against a reference strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis with well-known biofilm forming capability. Reduction of bacterial counts and morphological alterations of adhering bacteria, upon 2 h incubation, indicate a rapid contact-killing effect. The immobilized peptide was not toxic to osteoblasts, which adhered and spread better on functionalized titanium when co-cultured with bacteria, compared to non-coated surfaces.

Further, fruit waxing is a common practice in wholesale cucumber to preserve the water content of fruit and prolong shelf-life, but its impact on epiphytic microbiota is not well studied. This study investigated the survival of Salmonella Newport and S.

Javiana were spot inoculated onto fruit of cultivars 'Marketmore 97', 'Patio Snacker' and 'Corinto' (varieties with trichomes or spines), and 'Bella', 'Pepinex' and 'Summer Dance' (glabrous or smooth varieties). Cucumbers were held at room temperature for 24 h before inoculated sections of exocarp were excised for enteropathogen enumeration. S. Javiana persisted at higher populations than S.

While there was a ~2 log CFU g exocarp decline in populations on unwaxed cucumbers, the reduction on waxed cucumbers was ~1 log CFU g exocarp. A cultivar effect was also observed; 'Summer Dance' supported consistently higher and 'Corinto' and 'Marketmore 97' (though for S. Javiana only) consistently lower Salmonella levels. Cultivars with trichomes were associated with lower populations than glabrous cultivars (P < 0.05). Our data showed that Salmonella persistence on fruit differed for the two serotypes tested and that cultivar differences play a role in determining cucumber surface favourability for pathogen . Additionally, fruit waxing may elevate the risk of Salmonella persistence on cucumber.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In multivariate linear mixed-effect models, MDRB  predicts reduced Shannon α-diversity, after controlling for underlying liver disease, antibiotic exposures, and clinical complications. Importantly, pre-LT microbial markers predict subsequent  by MDRB. Our results suggest MDRB  as a major, previously unrecognized, marker of persistent dysbiosis.

At ages 4, 8, and 12 months, we collected antibiotic data, other exposure data, and nasopharyngeal cultures for pneumococcal isolation.Follow-up visits were completed for 211, 158, and 144 infants at ages 4, 8, and 12 months, respectively. By 12 months, 33% of infants attending the visits had ever been exposed to antibiotics, 67% if exposures to maternal antibiotics at birth are included. Pneumococci were isolated at 38/839 (4.5%) visits from 38 infants, including one 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13) serotype (6A). There were 1 (0.3%), 15 (7%), 7 (4%), and 15 (10%) infants who were colonized at 0-, 4-, 8-, and 12-month visits, respectively. By age 12 months, at least 35 (11%) infants had ever been colonized. Sixteen isolates (42%) exhibited nonsusceptibility to at least 1 antibiotic. Infants with recent antibiotic exposure were not more likely to be colonized or to harbor nonsusceptible organisms.Within a hospital birth cohort followed in the community, pneumococcal  and related antibiotic resistance were lower than previously reported, likely associated with PCV13 use. Antibiotic exposure was not associated with subsequent  with resistant isolates. The influence of other environmental factors needs further study.© The Author(s) 2019.

Hyphae, arbuscles, and vesicles were observed during the root . In the leaves, AMF induced an increase of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (54.0%-79.0%) and a decrease of oxygenated sesquiterpenes (41.3%-14.5%) at 7 dpi and 60 dpi (41.8%-21.5%), respectively. Cubenol, the main volatile compound of leaves, showed a significant decrease at 7 dpi (21.5%-0.28%) and 45 dpi (20.4%-18.42%). β-caryophyllene, the major volatile compound of the roots, displayed a significant reduction at 45 dpi (30.0%-20.0%). LOX increased in the roots at 21, 30, and 60 dpi. PAL was higher in leaves during all periods, except at 60 dpi, and increased at 21 and 45 dpi in the roots.

Sixteen supergroups have been described from different host taxa. Four supergroups A, B, M, and N were found in aphids according to prior studies. The cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, and the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, are typical polyphagous species with global distributions. We conducted an extensive and systematic survey of Wolbachia infections in these aphids from China. High incidences of Wolbachia infection were detected. The total infection incidence was 60% in A. gossypii and 88% in M. persicae. Both aphid species were infected with supergroups A, B and M. Different incidences of infection were observed among the seven geographical regions in China, which suggested a positive relationship between Wolbachia infections and the geographical distribution of aphid species. Furthermore, multiple infection patterns (M, B, A&M, B&M, and A&B&M) were observed. Infection patterns M and B&M were detected in almost all populations. Patterns A&B&M and B showed geographical restriction in North China. Three factors can possibly influence the Wolbachia infection incidences and patterns: the geographical distribution, aphid species, and different supergroup types.© The Author(s) 2019.

Deletion of gL detargets the virus from Eph family receptors. The ability of this gL-minus Gag recombinant RRV to infect, persist, and elicit immune responses was evaluated after intravenous inoculation of two  RRV-naïve rhesus monkeys. Both monkeys responded with an anti-RRV antibody response, and quantitation of RRV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by real time PCR revealed levels similar to those in monkeys infected with recombinant gL+ RRV. Comparison of RRV DNA levels in sorted CD3+ vs. CD20+ vs. CD14+ PBMC subpopulations indicated infection of the CD20+ subpopulation by the gL-minus RRV. This contrasts with results obtained with transformed B cell lines  where deletion of gL resulted in markedly reduced infectivity. Over a period of 20 weeks Gag-specific CD8+ T cell responses were documented by major histocompatibility complex class-I (MHC-I) tetramer staining. Vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell responses, which were predominantly directed against the Mamu-A*01-restricted Gag(181-189)CM9 epitope, could be inhibited by blockade of MHC-I presentation. Our results indicate that gL and the interaction with Eph family receptors is dispensable for the  of the B cell compartment following high-dose infection by the intravenous route, which suggests the existence of alternative receptors. Further, gL-minus RRV elicits cellular immune responses that are predominantly canonical in nature. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is associated with a substantial disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa, often in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The related rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV) has shown potential as a vector to immunize monkeys with antigens from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), the macaque model for HIV. KSHV and RRV engage cellular receptors from the Eph family via the viral gH/gL glycoprotein complex. We have now generated a recombinant RRV that expresses the SIV Gag antigen and does not express gL. This recombinant RRV was infectious by the intravenous route, established persistent infection in the B cell compartment, and elicited strong immune responses to the SIV Gag antigen. These results argue against a role of gL and Eph family receptors for B cell infection by RRV  and have implications for the development of a live-attenuated KSHV vaccine or vaccine vector.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642093>HCN-producing Pseudomonas protegens CHA0 affects intraradical viability of Rhizophagus irregularis in Sorghum vulgare roots.</a></h2><p>Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria inhabit the plant rhizosphere. Both functional groups can influence plant community structures, and interactions between them can vary from being synergistic to antagonistic. HCN-producing Pseudomonas protegens CHA0 is a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium. P. protegens CHA0 has been shown to weakly attach to AMF hyphae. Here, we analyze the effect of P. protegens CHA0 on the viability of intraradical AMF hyphae. Using pot experiments, we have grown mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal Sorghum vulgare var. M35 with P. protegens CHA0 or HCN mutant P. protegens CHA77, which did not produce HCN. Mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal Sorghum grown without CHA0 or CHA77 served as the control. While metabolically active AMF was not detected in mycorrhizal plants grown with HCN CHA0, the percentage of root  of metabolically active AMF in plants grown with HCN CHA77 was lower than in the control. Root phosphorus was highest in mycorrhizal plants grown with HCN CHA0, but root Fe was higher in plants grown with the bacterial strains.

It plays an important role in gut microbiota and immunity.

As a result of this review, we have summarized that glutamine could affect gut microbiota via different mechanisms including the reduction in the ratio of  to  with the activation of NF-κB and PI3K-Akt pathways, reducing the intestinal  ( lesions) and bacterial overgrowth or bacterial translocation, increasing the production of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) and immunoglobulin A+ (IgA) cells in the intestinal lumen, and decreasing asparagine levels. The potential applications of glutamine on gut microbiota include, but are not limited to, the management of obesity, bacterial translocation and community, cytokines profiles, and the management of side effects during post-chemotherapy and constipation periods.

Bacterial and fungal leaf microbiomes of the resulting near-isogenic lines were compared to the microbiome of the disease-susceptible parent line at two timepoints in multiple fields. ●Introgression of QTL from disease-resistant lines strongly shifted the relative abundance of diverse fungal and bacterial taxa in both 3-week-old and 7-week-old plants. Nevertheless, the effects on overall community structure and diversity were minor and varied among fields and years. Contrary to our expectations, host genotype effects were not any stronger in fields with high disease pressure than in uninfected fields, and microbiome succession over time was similar in heavily infected and uninfected plants. ●These results show that introgressed QTL can greatly improve broad-spectrum disease resistance while having only limited and inconsistent pleiotropic effects on the leaf microbiome in maize.© 2019 The Authors New Phytologist © 2019 New Phytologist Trust.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611409>  and persistence in a primate model.</a></h2><p> is associated with aggressive periodontitis resulting in premature tooth loss in adolescents.

The deterioration of a given material often incurs irreparable losses in terms of uniqueness and historical value. Hence preventive actions should be taken. One important challenge is to identify microbes involved in the biodeterioration process. In this study, we analyzed the microbial diversity of an ancient architectonical structure of the Rotunda of Sts. Felix and Adauctus, which is a part of the Wawel Royal Castle located in Krakow, Poland. The Rotunda is unavailable to tourists and could be treated as an extreme habitat due to the low content of nutrients coming either from sandstone plates bound with lime mortar or air movement. Microbial diversity was analyzed with the use of the high-throughput sequencing of marker genes corresponding to fragments of 16S rDNA (for Bacteria) and ITS2 (internal transcribed spacer 2) (for Fungi). The results showed that the microbial community adhered to wall surfaces is, to a large extent, endemic. Furthermore, alongside many microorganisms that could be destructive to masonry and mortar (e.g., , ), there were also bacteria, such as species of genera , , and , that can positively affect wall surface properties by reducing the damage caused by the presence of other microorganisms. We also showed that airborne microorganisms probably have little impact on the biodeterioration process as their abundance in the microbial community adhered to the ancient walls was very low.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652281>Shift in trophic niches of soil microarthropods with conversion of tropical rainforest into plantations as indicated by stable isotopes (15N, 13C).</a></h2><p>Land-use change is threatening biodiversity worldwide, affecting above and below ground animal communities by altering their trophic niches. However, shifts in trophic niches with changes in land use are little studied and this applies in particular to belowground animals. Oribatid mites are among the most abundant soil animals, involved in decomposition processes and nutrient cycling. We analyzed shifts in trophic niches of six soil-living oribatid mite species with the conversion of lowland secondary rainforest into plantation systems of different land-use intensity (jungle rubber, rubber and oil palm monoculture plantation) in two regions of southwest Sumatra, Indonesia. We measured stable isotope ratios (13C/12C and 15N/14N) of single oribatid mite individuals and calculated shifts in stable isotope niches with changes in land use. Significant changes in stable isotope ratios in three of the six studied oribatid mite species indicated that these species shift their trophic niches with changes in land use. The trophic shift was either due to changes in trophic level (δ15N values), to changes in the use of basal resources (δ13C values) or to changes in both. The trophic shift generally was most pronounced between more natural systems (rainforest and jungle rubber) on one side and monoculture plantations systems (rubber and oil palm plantations) on the other, reflecting that the shifts were related to land-use intensity. Although trophic niches of the other three studied species did not differ significantly between land-use systems they followed a similar trend. Overall, the results suggest that  of very different ecosystems such as rainforest and intensively managed monoculture plantations by oribatid mite species likely is related to their ability to shift their trophic niches, i.e. to trophic plasticity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647840>Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation and expression of GFP in Ascochyta lentis to characterize ascochyta blight disease progression in lentil.</a></h2><p>The plant immune system is made up of a complex response network that involves several lines of defense to fight invading pathogens. Fungal plant pathogens on the other hand, have evolved a range of ways to infect their host. The interaction between Ascochyta lentis and two lentil genotypes was explored to investigate the progression of ascochyta blight (AB) in lentils. In this study, we developed an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation system for A. lentis by constructing a new binary vector, pATMT-GpdGFP, for the constitutive expression of green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Green fluorescence was used as a highly efficient vital marker to study the developmental changes in A. lentis during AB disease progression on the susceptible and resistant lentil accessions, ILL6002 and ILL7537, respectively. The initial infection stages were similar in both the resistant and susceptible accessions where A. lentis uses infection structures such as germ tubes and appressoria to gain entry into the host while the host uses defense mechanisms to prevent pathogen entry. Penetration was observed at the junctions between neighbouring epidermal cells and occasionally, through the stomata. The pathogen attempted to penetrate and colonize ILL7537, but further fungal advancement appeared to be halted, and A. lentis did not enter the mesophyll. Successful entry and  of ILL6002 coincided with structural changes in A. lentis and the onset of necrotic lesions 5-7 days post inoculation. Once inside the leaf, A. lentis continued to grow, colonizing all parts of the leaf followed by plant cell collapse. Pycnidia-bearing spores appeared 14 days post inoculation, which marks the completion of the infection cycle. The use of fluorescent proteins in plant pathogenic fungi together with confocal laser scanning microscopy, provide a valuable tool to study the intracellular dynamics,  strategy and infection mechanisms during plant-pathogen interaction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624854>Short-term dialysis catheter versus central venous catheter infections in ICU patients: a post hoc analysis of individual data of 4 multi-centric randomized trials.</a></h2><p>Little is known on catheter-related infections associated with short-term dialysis catheters (DC).

Despite the excellent microbe-inhibitory effect of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based coatings, marine bacteria could still attach to surfaces and form natural biofilms. However, there is little information available on the common structural features of pioneer surface-biofilm bacteria (PSB) communities on different PDMS-based coatings with regard to their compositions, distributions and diversity.

The results revealed the PSB communities on different PDMS-based coatings possessed high similarities in compositional, structural and diversity features, but varied greatly in relative abundance and distributions. Proteobacteria was the most diverse and overwhelming phylum in biofilms formed on all PDMS-based coatings, followed by Cyanobacteria. In addition, the decreased abundance of Proteobacteria and the increased abundance of Cyanobacteria on the carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-modifed PDMS composites (CPCs) may contribute to their differential anti-biofouling effect against the  of juvenile macrofoulers.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Utilizing a systematic scoping review methodology, the study returned a total of 637 peer-reviewed articles that were identified and reviewed for inclusion. The process of exclusion resulted in the inclusion of eight peer-reviewed studies and 51 reports and discussion papers sourced from gray literature. Findings from this study, though dearth, indicate that trauma-informed and culturally safe interventions play a significant role in Indigenous children's health and well-being while in care. Their experiences of abuse and neglect transcend individual trauma and include intergenerational pain and suffering resulting from long-lasting impacts of , displacement from culture and country, genocidal policies, racism, and the overall systemic disadvantage. As such, a therapeutic response, embedded within Indigenous cultural frameworks and knowledges of trauma, is not only important but absolutely necessary and aims to acknowledge the intersectionality between the needs of Indigenous children in care and the complex systemic disadvantage impacting them.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637143>Fundamental niche unfilling and potential invasion risk of the slider turtle .</a></h2><p>How species colonize new environments is still a fundamental question in ecology and evolution, assessable by evaluating range characteristics of invasive species. Here we propose a model approach to evaluate environmental conditions and species features to predict niche changes in non-equilibrium contexts. It incorporates potentially range-limiting processes (fundamental niche), hence allowing for better predictions of range shifts, differentiation of analog and non-analog conditions between the native and non-native (invaded) ranges, and identification of environmental conditions not currently available but likely in the future. We apply our approach with the worldwide invasive slider-turtle .We estimated the native and non-native realized niches of  and built its fundamental niche based on key features of the turtle's temperature physiological tolerance limits and survival-associated factors. We next estimated response functions adjusted to the physiological predictor variables and estimated habitat suitability values, followed by a comprehensive set of analyses and simulations to compare the environmental conditions occupied by  (at its native and non-native ranges).Climatic space analysis showed that the 's non-native realized niche is 28.6% greater than the native one. Response curves showed that it does not use its entire range of temperature tolerances (density curves for native: 5.3-23.7 °C and non-native: 1.7-28.4 °C ranges). Whether considering the mean temperature of the warmest or the coldest quarter, it occupies a wider range of temperatures along its non-native distribution. Results of the response curves for worldwide (global) and across Mexico (regional) comparisons showed it occupies analog and non-analog conditions between its native and invaded ranges, exhibiting also unoccupied suitable climatic conditions.We demonstrate that  occupies a wider subset of its fundamental niche along its non-native range (within its physiological tolerances), revealing that the species observed niche shift corresponds to a different subset of its fundamental niche (niche unfilling). We also identified suitable environmental conditions, globally and regionally, where the slider turtle could potentially invade. Our approach allows to accurately predict niche changes in novel or non-equilibrium contexts, which can improve our understanding about ecological aspects and geographic range boundaries in current and potential invasions.©2019 Espindola et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667953>Root  by endophytic insect pathogenic fungi.</a></h2><p>Several ascomycetous insect pathogenic fungi, including species in the genera Beauveria and Metarhizium, are also plant root symbionts/endophytes and are termed endophytic insect pathogenic fungi (EIPF). The ability of these fungi to infect insects as well as colonize plant roots is coupled in that EIPF can translocate insect-derived nitrogen from infected insect cadavers in the soil to the host plant in exchange for plant photosynthate. This symbiotic interaction offers other benefits to the plant; EIPF can improve plant growth, they are antagonistic to plant pathogens and herbivores and can enhance plant tolerance to abiotic stresses. The mechanisms and underlying biochemical and genetic features of insect pathogenesis are generally well established. However, there is a paucity of information regarding the underlying mechanisms in this plant symbiotic association. Here we review five aspects of EIPF interactions with host plant roots: (1) rhizosphere , (2) signaling factors from the plant and EIPF, (3) modulation of plant defense responses, (4) nutrient exchange, and (5) tripartite interactions with insects and other microorganisms. The elucidation of these interactions is fundamental to understanding this symbiotic association for effective application of EIPF in an agricultural setting.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647842>Prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in healthy Chinese population: A system review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>To comprehensively determine the prevalence of MRSA in healthy Chinese population, the influencing factors of MRSA  and its antibiotic resistance.Articles that studied prevalence or influencing factors of MRSA carriage in healthy Chinese population were retrieved from PubMed, Ovid database, three Chinese electronic databases.

The prevalence of MRSA in studies with oxacillin disk diffusion method (28%, 95%CI: 21%-35%) seemed higher than that with the mecA gene method(12%, 95%CI: 7%-19%). MRSA in studies conducted in Taiwan was more common than in Mainland China and Hong Kong. Similar results were found in meta-regression. Influencing factors for MRSA  were noted in seven eligible studies, they included younger age (OR: 3.54, 95% CI: 2.38-5.26; OR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.73-2.9), attending day care centers (DCCs) (OR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.4-2.72; OR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.2-1.95), flu vaccination (OR:1.73, 95% CI: 1.28-2.35), using antibiotics within the past year (OR: 2.05, 95% CI:1.35-3.11), residing in northern Taiwan (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.19-1.77), regular visits to health care facility (OR: 23.83, 95% CI: 2.72-209.01), household member working in health care facility (OR: 8.98, 95% CI:1.4-55.63), and contact with livestock (OR: 6.31, 95% CI: 3.44-11.57). Moreover, MRSA was found to be highly resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin, with a pooled resistance ratio of 100, 93, 88, and 75%, respectively. However, no resistance were noted to vancomycin.The pooled prevalence of MRSA was considerably high in health Chinese population. Additionally, these strains showed extreme resistance to penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin. Public MRSA protection measures and the surveillance of MRSA should be strengthened to reduce the spread of MRSA among hospitals, communities, and livestock.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659301>Lypd8 inhibits attachment of pathogenic bacteria to colonic epithelia.</a></h2><p>Mucosal barriers segregate commensal microbes from the intestinal epithelia to maintain gut homeostasis. Ly6/Plaur domain-containing 8 (Lypd8), a highly glycosylated glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein selectively expressed on colonic enterocytes, promotes this segregation by inhibiting bacterial invasion of the inner mucus layer and colonic epithelia. However, it remains unclear whether Lypd8 prevents infection with enteric bacterial pathogens. Here, we demonstrate that Lypd8 strongly contributes to early-phase defense against Citrobacter rodentium, which causes colitis by inducing attachment and effacement (A/E) lesions on colonic epithelia. Lypd8 inhibits C. rodentium attachment to intestinal epithelial cells by binding to intimin, thereby suppressing the interaction between intimin and translocated intimin receptor. Lypd8 deficiency leads to rapid C. rodentium  in the colon, resulting in severe colitis with Th17-cell and neutrophil expansion in the lamina propria. This study identifies a novel function for Lypd8 against A/E bacteria and highlights the role of enterocytes as crucial players in innate immunity for protection against enteric bacterial pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619718>RNA-Seq analysis of ileocecal valve and peripheral blood from Holstein cattle infected with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis revealed dysregulation of the CXCL8/IL8 signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Paratuberculosis is chronic granulomatous enteritis of ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Whole RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a promising source of novel biomarkers for early MAP infection and disease progression in cattle. Since the blood transcriptome is widely used as a source of biomarkers, we analyzed whether it recapitulates, at least in part, the transcriptome of the ileocecal valve (ICV), the primary site of MAP . Total RNA was prepared from peripheral blood (PB) and ICV samples, and RNA-Seq was used to compare gene expression between animals with focal or diffuse histopathological lesions in gut tissues versus control animals with no detectable signs of infection. Our results demonstrated both shared, and PB and ICV-specific gene expression in response to a natural MAP infection. As expected, the number of differentially expressed (DE) genes was larger in the ICV than in the PB samples. Among the DE genes in the PB and ICV samples, there were some common genes irrespective of the type of lesion including the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8/IL8), apolipoprotein L (APOLD1), and the interferon inducible protein 27 (IFI27). The biological processes (BP) enriched in the PB gene expression profiles from the cows with diffuse lesions included the killing of cells of other organism, defense response, immune response and the regulation of neutrophil chemotaxis. Two of these BP, the defense and immune response, were also enriched in the ICV from the cows with diffuse lesions. Metabolic analysis of the DE genes revealed that the N-glycan biosynthesis, bile secretion, one-carbon pool by folate and purine metabolism were significantly enriched in the ICV from the cows with focal lesions. In the ICV from cows with diffuse lesions; the valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation route, purine metabolism, vitamin digestion and absorption and the cholesterol routes were enriched. Some of the identified DE genes, BP and metabolic pathways will be studied further to develop novel diagnostic tools, vaccines and immunotherapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664917>Two cases of fungal cyst infection in ADPKD: is this really a rare complication?</a></h2><p>Cyst infection is a prevalent complication in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients, however therapeutic and diagnostic approaches towards this condition remain unclear. The confirmation of a likely episode of cyst infection by isolating the pathogenic microorganism in a clinical scenario is possible only in the minority of cases. The available antimicrobial treatment guidelines, therefore, might not be appropriate to some patients.We describe two unique cases of kidney cyst infection by Candida albicans, a condition that has not been previously described in literature. Both cases presented clear risk factors for Candida spp. infection. However, since there was no initial indication of cyst aspiration and culture, antifungal therapy was not immediately started and empirical treatment was initiated as recommended by the current guidelines. Antifungal treatment was instituted in both cases along the clinical course, according to their specificities.Our report highlights the possibility of Candida spp. cyst infection. Failure of clinical improvement with antibiotics should raise the suspicion of a fungal infection. Identification of infected cysts should be pursued in such cases, particularly with PET-CT, and when technically possible followed by cyst aspiration and culture to guide treatment. Risk factors for this condition, such as Candida spp. , previous antimicrobial therapy, hemodialysis, necrotizing pancreatitis, gastrointestinal/hepatobiliary surgical procedure, central venous catheter, total parenteral nutrition, diabetes mellitus and immunodeficiency (neutropenia < 500 neutrophils/mL, hematologic malignancy, chemotherapy, immunosuppressant drugs), should be also considered accepted criteria for empirical antifungal therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659300>Generation of protective pneumococcal-specific nasal resident memory CD4 T cells via parenteral immunization.</a></h2><p>The generation of tissue-resident memory T cells (T) is an essential aspect of immunity at mucosal surfaces, and it has been suggested that preferential generation of T is one of the principal advantages of mucosally administered vaccines. We have previously shown that antigen-specific, IL-17-producing CD4 T cells can provide capsular antibody-independent protection against nasal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae; but whether pneumococcus-responsive T are localized within the nasal mucosa and are sufficient for protection from carriage has not been determined. Here, we show that intranasal administration of live or killed pneumococci to mice generates pneumococcus-responsive IL-17A-producing CD4 mucosal T Furthermore, we show that these cells are sufficient to mediate long-lived, neutrophil-dependent protection against subsequent pneumococcal nasal challenge. Unexpectedly, and in contrast with the prevailing paradigm, we found that parenteral administration of killed pneumococci also generates protective IL-17ACD4 T in the nasal mucosa. These results demonstrate a critical and sufficient role of T in prevention of pneumococcal , and further that these cells can be generated by parenteral immunization. Our findings therefore have important implications regarding the generation of immune protection at mucosal surfaces by vaccination.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623335>Tomato Plants Treated with Systemin Peptide Show Enhanced Levels of Direct and Indirect Defense Associated with Increased Expression of Defense-Related Genes.</a></h2><p>Plant defense peptides represent an important class of compounds active against pathogens and insects. These molecules controlling immune barriers can potentially be used as novel tools for plant protection, which mimic natural defense mechanisms against invaders. The constitutive expression in tomato plants of the precursor of the defense peptide systemin was previously demonstrated to increase tolerance against moth larvae and aphids and to hamper the  by phytopathogenic fungi, through the expression of a wealth of defense-related genes. In this work we studied the impact of the exogenous supply of systemin to tomato plants on pests to evaluate the use of the peptide as a tool for crop protection in non-transgenic approaches. By combining gene expression studies and bioassays with different pests we demonstrate that the exogenous supply of systemin to tomato plants enhances both direct and indirect defense barriers. Experimental plants, exposed to this peptide by foliar spotting or root uptake through hydroponic culture, impaired larval growth and development of the noctuid moth  , even across generations, reduced the leaf  by the fungal pathogen  and were more attractive towards natural herbivore antagonists. The induction of these defense responses was found to be associated with molecular and biochemical changes under control of the systemin signalling cascade. Our results indicate that the direct delivery of systemin, likely characterized by a null effect on non-target organisms, represents an interesting tool for the sustainable protection of tomato plants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609709>Use of impregnated catheters to decrease  rates in neonates - a randomized controlled pilot trial.</a></h2><p>Nosocomial infections increase mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. Central venous line  is a major risk factor for the development of such infections. In adults and children, antibiotic and antimycotic impregnated catheters have been demonstrated to reduce . However, recently published data showed no significant difference in bloodstream infection in neonates when an impregnated catheter was used. We investigated the effect of impregnation of percutaneously inserted micro-catheters (PICC) on  in preterm and sick term infants in our unit.Neonates were randomly assigned to receive either a standard (S-PICC; n = 34) or antibiotic and antimycotic impregnated (IP-PICC; n = 37) PICC. Catheters were placed and removed according to a standard procedure and subsequently examined by roll-out culture. The primary outcome was the rate of  defined as >15 colony-forming-units/ml. Additional outcomes were catheter associated or systemic infections.The rate of  was lower in neonates who received an IP-PICC as compared to S-PICC (5.6% vs. 12.1% respectively; p = 0.42). However, the difference was not significant. In IP-PICC vs S-PICC, catheter related local infection (CRI) although lower was not statistically significant (2.9% vs. 6.1%; p = 0.60). We observed no difference in catheter related systemic infection (CR-SI) (0% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.48). The neonates whose catheters were colonized were predominantly of a lower gestational age (median 254/7, p = 0.05) and males (100%, p = 0.01). In addition, the median colony count in the colonized IP-PICC catheters was lower as compared to S- PICC group (53 vs 250, p = 0.06).The use of antibiotic and antimycotic impregnated PICC-lines in neonates tended to decrease  rates in neonates in our centers but this difference was not significant. Lower gestational age and male sex are risk factors for catheter .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675365>Genomic comparison of diverse Salmonella serovars isolated from swine.</a></h2><p>Food animals act as a reservoir for many foodborne pathogens. Salmonella enterica is one of the leading pathogens that cause food borne illness in a broad host range including animals and humans. They can also be associated with a single host species or a subset of hosts, due to genetic factors associated with  and infection. Adult swine are often asymptomatic carriers of a broad range of Salmonella servoars and can act as an important reservoir of infections for humans. In order to understand the genetic variations among different Salmonella serovars, Whole Genome Sequences (WGS) of fourteen Salmonella serovars from swine products were analyzed. More than 75% of the genes were part of the core genome in each isolate and the higher fraction of gene assign to different functional categories in dispensable genes indicated that these genes acquired for better adaptability and diversity. High concordance (97%) was detected between phenotypically confirmed antibiotic resistances and identified antibiotic resistance genes from WGS. The resistance determinants were mainly located on mobile genetic elements (MGE) on plasmids or integrated into the chromosome. Most of known and putative virulence genes were part of the core genome, but a small fraction were detected on MGE. Predicted integrated phage were highly diverse and many harbored virulence, metal resistance, or antibiotic resistance genes. CRISPR (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) patterns revealed the common ancestry or infection history among Salmonella serovars. Overall genomic analysis revealed a great deal of diversity among Salmonella serovars due to acquired genes that enable them to thrive and survive during infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634477>Preoperative topical liposomal ozone dispersion to reduce bacterial  in conjunctival sac and periocular skin.</a></h2><p>Periocular skin and ocular conjunctiva bacteria as part of the ocular microbiome plays an important role in maintenance of healthy ocular surface and protect against pathogenic species. Prophylaxis represents a keystone to reduce this bacterial load before surgical procedures. Despite many prophylactic agents are available the preferred perioperative ocular surface antimicrobial agent is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of preoperative liposomal ozone dispersion in reducing bacterial  from the conjunctival sac and periocular skin in dogs, in comparison with povidone-iodine. Twenty-two owned dogs consisting with 44 eyes in total scheduled for diversified ophthalmic surgery or surgical procedure were enrolled for the study and divided in four groups (ozone eyelid, ozone conjunctiva, fluoroquinolone, placebo) receiving the respective preoperative protocol. A swab was taken before beginning and at the end of the protocol evaluating total microbial count, coagulase positive and negative staphylococci as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in CFU for total microbial count, coagulase positive and negative staphylococci both for liposomal ozone dispersion and povidone iodine; For group, no statistical difference in median CFU for both one-day placebo and fluoroquinolone preoperative prophylactic topical therapy. The results of the present study demonstrate that liposomal ozone-dispersion is able to reduce preoperative bacterial load in ocular surface at the same strength of povidone iodine.Copyright © 2019.

The Lymphoid Enhancer-binding Factor-1 (LEF1) is an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor that is commonly overexpressed in brain-colonizing cancer cells. Here, we overexpressed LEF1 in an in vivo breast cancer brain  model. It shortened survival, albeit without engaging EMT at the MMPI. By differential proteome analysis, we identified a novel function of LEF1 as a regulator of the glutathione (GSH) system, the principal cellular redox buffer. LEF1 overexpression also conferred resistance against therapeutic GSH depletion during brain  and improved management of intracellular ROS. We conclude that besides EMT, LEF1 facilitates metastasis by improving the anti-oxidative capacity of epithelial breast cancer cells, in particular during  of the brain parenchyma.

Teleost fishes are among the few vertebrates to undergo widespread  of caves and often exhibit eye regression with blindness. Cave populations of the poeciliid fish  (cave molly) exhibit reduced-albeit functional-eyes, offering the opportunity to investigate partial eye regression. We sequenced eye transcriptomes of cave and surface populations of  to identify differentially expressed genes that potentially underlie eye regression in cave mollies. We identified 28 significantly differentially expressed genes, 20 of which were directly related to light sensitivity, eye structure and visual signaling. Twenty-six of these genes were downregulated in cave compared to surface populations. Functional enrichment analysis revealed eye-related gene ontologies that were under-represented in cave mollies. In addition, a set of co-expressed genes related to vision and circadian rhythm was correlated with habitat type (cave versus surface). Our study suggests that differential gene expression plays a key role in the beginning evolutionary stages of eye regression in , shedding further light on regressive evolution in cavefish.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669610>Nasal  of Staphylococcus aureus and the risk of surgical site infection after spine surgery: a meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Nasal  of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) may increase the risk of surgical site infection (SSI) after spine surgeries, although the results of previous studies were inconsistent.To evaluate the influences of nasal  of SA, methicillin-susceptible SA (MSSA), and methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA) on the incidence of SSI after spine surgery.systematic review and meta-analysis.Seven studies including 10,650 patients who underwent nasal swab examination before spine surgeries were included, and 221 patients had nasal  of MRSA at baseline.Association between baseline nasal  of SA, MRSA and SSI after spine surgery.Relevant follow-up studies were identified through systematic searches of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. A random effects model was applied to pool the results. Subgroup analyses were performed according to whether MRSA decolonization was applied.During follow-up, a total of 244 SSI events occurred, including 57 MRSA-SSI events. Pooled results showed that nasal SA (risk ratio [RR]=0.75, p=0.22) or MSSA  (RR=0.60, p=0.22) did not significantly affect the risk of overall SSI after surgeries. However, nasal MRSA  was associated with significantly increased risks of overall SSI and MRSA-SSI (RR=2.52 and 6.21 respectively, both p<0.001). Interestingly, the associations between nasal MRSA  and increased risks of overall and MRSA-SSI remained significant in studies without MRSA decolonization, but became insignificant in studies with MRSA decolonization.Nasal MRSA  may be associated with increased risks of overall SSI and MRSA-SSI after spine surgeries, and nasal MRSA decolonization may be associated with a reduction of SSI in these patients.Copyright © 2019.
