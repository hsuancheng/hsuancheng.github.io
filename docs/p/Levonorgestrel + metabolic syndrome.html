In girls with polycystic ovary  (PCOS), insulin sensitization results in a more favorable endocrine- outcome than oral contraception; we assessed whether those differences are underscored by changes in circulating fetuin-A.Fetuin-A concentration endocrine- markers and hepatovisceral fat were measured longitudinally in 35 PCOS girls [age, 16 yr; body mass index (BMI), 23 kg/m] randomized to receive either oral contraception [ethinylestradiol- ( = 18)] or a low-dose combination of spironolactone, pioglitazone, and metformin (SPIOMET,  = 17) over 12 months. Healthy adolescent girls (age- and BMI-matched) were used as controls ( = 25).Pretreatment fetuin-A serum levels in PCOS girls were lower than those in controls. After 12 months on treatment, fetuin-A raised to control levels only in the SPIOMET subgroup ( = 0.009, versus oral contraception); this increase was paralleled by a healthier  profile with less hepatic fat (by MRI); baseline serum fetuin-A as well as the changes over 12 months was inversely related to hepatic adiposity.A low-dose combination of insulin sensitizers and an antiandrogen-but not oral contraception-normalizes fetuin-A levels in adolescent girls with PCOS.

The use of oral ethinylestradiol- (EEL) formulation is also common among young women worldwide. The present study aimed at determining the effect of EEL on high fructose-induced cardiac triglyceride (TG) and glycogen accumulation. The study also investigated the possible involvement of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK-4) in EEL and/or high fructose  effects on the heart. Ten-week-old female Wistar rats were allotted into four groups. The control, EEL, FRU, and EEL + FRU rats received distilled water (vehicle, p.o.), 1.0 μg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 μg  (p.o.), 10% fructose (w/v), and 1.0 μg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 μg  and 10% fructose, respectively, daily for 8 weeks. Data showed that EEL or high fructose caused IR' impaired glucose tolerance' hyperlipidemia' increased plasma lactate, lactate dehydrogenase, PDK-4, uric acid, xanthine oxidase (XO), adenosine deaminase (ADA), malondialdehyde (MDA), cardiac uric acid, TG, TG/HDL- cholesterol, glycogen synthesis, MDA, and visceral fat content and reduced glutathione. High fructose also resulted in impaired pancreatic β-cell function, hyperglycemia, and increased cardiac PDK-4, lactate synthesis, and mass. Nonetheless, these alterations were ameliorated in EEL plus high fructose rats. This study demonstrates that high fructose-induced myocardial TG and glycogen accumulation is attributable to increased PDK-4. Besides, EEL could be a useful pharmacological utility for protection against cardiac dysmetabolism by inhibiting PDK-4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308416>Oral contraceptive use increases risk of inflammatory and coagulatory disorders in women with Polycystic Ovarian : An observational study.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovarian  (PCOS) is a multispectral disorder requiring lifelong management. Its pathophysiology is still being explored which makes its treatment options restrained. Present study explores impact of oral contraceptive mode of treatment on , hormonal, inflammation and coagulation profile of PCOS women. 50 subjects diagnosed with Rotterdam criteria receiving no drug treatment served as controls whereas 50 subjects receiving only OCPs (Ethinyl estradiol 0.03 mg,  0.15 mg) as a mode of treatment at least for six-months served as cases. Ferriman-Gallwey score and hormonal profile improved on OCP treatment. However, parameters like weight, Body mass index, waist-hip ratio, Oral glucose tolerance test, lipid profile, insulin, HOMA-IR, adiponectin, interleukin1β, visfatin, resistin, tissue factor, PT and APTT showed considerable derangements in OCP group. All above parameters are associated with the risk of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, coronary vascular disease, cancers, hypercoagulable state, venous thromboembolism and thrombotic events. Long-term use of OCPs needs to be considered carefully for PCOS patients who are already burdened with associated risk factors. This study was conducted in a region where women do not have much access to high-end screening and diagnostic facilities that further exacerbates their clinical outcomes. Large scale, long-term studies need to be designed to further evaluate safety use of OCPs in PCOS women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29202210>Differential Effects on Haemostatic Markers by Metformin and the Contraceptive Pill: A Randomized Comparative Trial in PCOS.</a></h2><p> Polycystic ovarian  (PCOS) affects up to 18% of reproductive-aged women with increased risks of cardiovascular disease and venous thromboembolic disease, related to  and hormonal features, obesity and an apparent hypofibrinolytic state, possibly exacerbated by current PCOS treatments.  To investigate and compare haemostatic impacts of common pharmacological treatments and explore relationships with hormonal and  variables in PCOS.  This mechanistic sub-study using biobanked samples from a 6-month randomized comparative trial of pharmacological treatments assessed pro- and anti-thrombotic markers and overall haemostatic activity. Overweight women of mean age 33.9 ± 6.7 years and mean BMI (body mass index) of 36.5 ± 7.0 kg/m with PCOS ( = 60) were randomized to either metformin, higher-dose oral contraceptive pill (OCP) or low-dose OCP + spironolactone (OCP + S). Primary outcome measures included changes in plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (PF1 and 2), plasminogen, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) and thrombin generation (TG).  PAI-1 activity fell in all groups, ADMA fell in higher-dose OCP, PF1 and 2 increased with metformin and higher-dose OCP, TG rose and tPA fell in both OCP groups, plasminogen increased in all and TAFI increased after higher-dose OCP.  Endothelial function (primary haemostasis) improved with higher dose with some improvement in low-dose OCP + S and metformin. Aberrant coagulation was noted in both OCP groups, but not with metformin. Fibrinolysis was reduced with higher-dose OCP. Our work suggests an additional dimension of treatment (haemostatic system effects) that favours metformin treatment over the OCP in PCOS.Schattauer GmbH Stuttgart.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28693985>Cardiovascular risk markers among obese women using the -releasing intrauterine system: A randomised controlled trial.</a></h2><p>According to international guidelines, women with obesity without other comorbidities can safely use any hormonal contraceptive (HC). However, limited information is available about contraceptive safety for women with obesity since obesity is an exclusion criterion of most contraceptive clinical trials. As such little is known about the possible risks of HC exposure for women with obesity without comorbidities. One way to assess possible long-term risks in this population, even prior to the development of any clinical disease, is to measure alterations in subclinical atherosclerosis markers. We evaluated the effects of the -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) on subclinical markers of cardiovascular risk in women with obesity. This is a randomised clinical trial in which 106 women with obesity [body mass index (BMI)≥30kg/m] were randomised to the LNG-IUS (n=53) or to non-hormonal methods (n=53) and followed for 12 months. We evaluated waist circumference (WC), blood pressure, blood glucose, insulin, lipid profile, and endothelial function markers (carotid intima-media thickness, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, and carotid arterial stiffness). At 12 months, BMI (p=0.005), WC (p=0.045), and glucose levels (p=0.015) were significantly lower in the LNG-IUS group than in the control group. We did not find any clinically relevant changes in subclinical markers of cardiovascular risk among with obesity women at 12 months after LNG-IUS placement compared to users of non-hormonal contraceptive methods.ClinicalTrials.gov .Copyright © 2017 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), is the usual first choice of treatment in women with PCOS. Because OCP use has been linked to the risk of venous thrombosis and there are limited data on the effect of OCP use on the inflammatory state of women with PCOS, our objective was to compare the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 between drug-naive and OCP-treated women with PCOS. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Consequent to women diagnosed with PCOS on the basis of Rotterdam 2003 criteria, either treated with OCPs (ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg, levonogestrel-0.15 mg) for a period of 6 months (n = 50) or drug-naive (n = 51) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study.The mean ages of patients and control participants were comparable (21.99 ± 4.78 vs 21.92 ± 5.83 years; P = .947) as was body mass index (24.47 ± 3.92 vs 23.66 ± 3.43; P = .271). Clinical and androgen excess symptoms were significantly better in the OCP group compared with the drug-naive group (P = .01, P = .04). Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the OCP group (P = .01). Plasma ICAM-1 levels, TNF-α levels, and MCP-1 levels showed a higher trend in patients but reached statistical significance only in cases of ICAM-1 and TNF-α (P = .01).OCP treatment of 6 months increases plasma ICAM-1, MCP-1, and TNF-α levels among women with PCOS, although OCPs significantly help in ameliorating features of hyperandrogenism and regularizing menstrual cycles. These cytokines correlate positively with many  parameters including plasma glucose, lipids, and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance. Further investigation with well designed, randomized, longitudinal studies might help to ascertain the effect of OCPs on proinflammatory profiles among women with PCOS.Copyright © 2016 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.

They were administrated to do one-time exercise on the improved Harvard step (up and down steps 30 times/min for 3minutes). Their urinewascollected before and after exercise, and the differential metabolitesin urine were detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The multidimensional statistical methods were used to analyze the metabolites by principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Finally, MetPA database was used to analyze the metabolites and to construct the correlativemetabolic pathways.Compared with the control group, the creatine, indoleacetaldehyde, phytosphingosine and pyroglutamic acid were selected as differential metabolites and the contents of those were decreased significantly (<0.05 or <0.01) in CFS groupbefore the step movement. However, 11 differential metabolitesin CFS group were selected out after exercise, which were nonanedioic acid, methyladenosine, acetylcarnitine, capric acid, corticosterone, creatine, , pantothenic acid, pyroglutamic acid, xanthosine and xanthurenic acid in sequence, the contents of methyladenosine and creatinewere significantly increased (<0.05) and the contents of the other 9 differentialmetabolites were significantly decreased (<0.05 or <0.01)compared with the control group.The 15 differential metabolites mentioned above were input MetPA database in order to analyze the  pathways weighted score.The results showed that the arginine-proline metabolism pathway disordersweredetected in theCFS group before exercise, the marker metabolite wascreatine.

Androgens are protective. Influence of oral contraception on drug-induced TdP and QT prolongation is controversial.To determine if the extent of sotalol-induced corrected QT (QTc) prolongation and specific T-wave morphological changes, which are biomarkers for the risk of drug-induced TdP, differ in patients according to the androgenic activity of the type of oral contraceptive (OCs) they take compared with patients who took no pills.A cohort of 498 healthy, nonmenopausal women received 80 mg of oral sotalol, a drug with known risk of drug-induced TdP, during this study in a clinical investigation center. The participants also took either no oral contraception or received OCs with different types of progestin:  (which has high androgenic potency), desogestrel or gestodene (which has intermediate androgenic potency), or drospirenone (which has antiandrogenic properties). Women were enrolled from February 2008 to February 2012, and data analysis took place from September 2014 to May 2018.Electrocardiographic changes 3 hours after sotalol administration.A total of 137 women received , 41 received desogestrel, 51 received gestodene, and 62 received drospirenone; another 207 received no OCs. Baseline QTc duration, plasma sotalol levels, and potassium levels did not significantly differ among groups. However, 3 hours after sotalol exposure, QTc prolongation was greater in women taking drospirenone (mean [SD] increase, 31.2 [12.6] milliseconds from baseline) than in women taking no OCs (mean [SD] increase, 24.6 [12.5] milliseconds; P = .005) or those taking  (mean [SD] increase, 24.2 [13.7] milliseconds; P = .005). The frequency of sotalol-induced T-wave alteration was higher in women taking drospirenone (n = 13 of 61 [21.0%]) than those taking  (n = 20 of 137 [14.6%]) or women taking no OCs (n = 24 of 207 [11.6%]; P = .01). Disproportionality analysis using the European pharmacovigilance database showed a higher reporting rate of OC-induced prolonged QT and ventricular arrhythmias in women taking drospirenone than  (drug-induced long QT : reporting odds ratio [ROR], 6.2 [95% CI, 1.3-30.8]; P = .01; ventricular arrhythmia: ROR, 3.3 [95% CI, 1.7-6.3]; P < .001).Contraceptive pills are associated with variable drug-induced alterations of ventricular repolarization in healthy nonmenopausal women. Drospirenone, an antiandrogenic pill, was associated with increased sotalol-induced QTc prolongation, although absolute QTc prolongation was modest. This finding was supported by the European pharmacovigilance database, which showed a higher reporting rate of suspected OC-induced ventricular arrhythmias on drospirenone compared with . More data are required on whether antiandrogenic OCs lead to clinically significant adverse events in patients taking QTc-prolonging drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26733500>-Releasing Intrauterine System for Women With Polycystic Ovary :  and Clinical Effects.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary  (PCOS) is related to clinical and  comorbidities that may limit the prescription of combined hormonal contraceptives, with consequent need to use progestogen-only contraceptives (POCs). Thus, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and  effects of a POC, the -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), in women with PCOS followed up over a period of 6 months compared to baseline and to women without PCOS. Thus, an observational, prospective, controlled study was conducted on 30 women with a diagnosis of PCOS who presented adverse effect secondary to the use of combined oral contraceptives (nausea, headache, mastalgia or vomiting; PCOS group) paired with 30 ovulatory women without PCOS (control group), both groups being free of comorbidities and having chosen the LNG-IUS as contraceptive. Clinical, laboratory, and ultrasonographic variables were evaluated immediately before LNG-IUS insertion and 6 months after the use of this method. Before LNG-IUS insertion, the PCOS group had higher total testosterone levels (P = .04), lower HDL levels (P = .04), and greater ovarian volume (P < .01) than the control group. Six months after LNG-IUS insertion, there was a 2.3% increase in abdominal circumference (P = .04) and a 3.4% increase in fasting glycemia (P = .02). On the other hand, mean ovarian volume was 10% smaller compared to the volume found before LNG-IUS insertion (P = .04), LDL levels were reduced by 5.2% (P = .03), and total cholesterol levels were reduced by 6.7% (P < .01) compared to baseline evaluation in the PCOS group. The remaining variables did not differ significantly during the 6 months of observation. The control group did not show significant changes compared to the period before LNG-IUS insertion. When the groups were compared after the 6-month follow-up, only glycemia showed a statistically significant variation between the groups, with glycemia levels increasing by 3.4% in the PCOS group and decreasing by 2.6% in the control group (P = .008). In conclusion, the use of the LNG-IUS for 6 months was not associated with relevant changes in clinical or  variables of women with no comorbidities regardless of the presence of PCOS.© The Author(s) 2016.</p></html>
