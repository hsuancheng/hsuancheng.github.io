The human infant, however, is born with a sterile gut and the complex gastrointestinal host/bacterial ecosystem is only established after birth by rapid bacterial colonization. Composition of newborn gut flora depends on several factors including type of birth (Ceasarian or natural), manner of early feeding (breast milk or formula), and exposure to local, physical environment. Imbalance in normal, healthy gut flora contributes to several adult human  including   (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's ) and Clostridium difficile associated , and early childhood  such as necrotizing enterocolitis. As a first step towards characterization of the role of gut bacteria in human health and , we conducted an 850 MHz (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy study to monitor changes in metabolic profiles of urine and fecal extracts of 15 mice following gut sterilization by the broad-spectrum antibiotic enrofloxacin (also known as Baytril). Ten metabolites changed in urine following enrofloxacin treatment including decreased  due to loss of microbial catabolism of sugars and polysaccharides, decreased trimethylamine-N-oxide due to loss of microbial catabolism of choline, and increased creatine and creatinine due to loss of microbial enzyme degradation. Eight metabolites changed in fecal extracts of mice treated with enrofloxacin including depletion of amino acids produced by microbial proteases, reduction in metabolites generated by lactate-utilizing bacteria, and increased urea caused by loss of microbial ureases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28942135>A medicinal plant compound, capnoidine, prevents the onset of inflammation in a mouse model of .</a></h2><p>The traditional uses of Corydalis dubia, Ajania nubigena and Pleurospermum amabile in the Bhutanese traditional medicine for treating disorders related to inflammatory conditions and the in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of their crude extracts inspired the isolation and the investigation of anticolitic properties of four pure compounds.Three medicinal plants were collected from Himalayan Mountains of Bhutan. Capnoidine and scoulerine were isolated from C. dubia, linalool oxide  from A. nubigena and isomyristicin from P. amabile using natural product isolation protocols. Four compounds were investigated for their anti-inflammatory activities against IBD- using chemically induced (TNBS) mice model of . Capnoidine conferred the best preliminary protection against TNBS-induced  in mice and we have conducted in-depth pharmacological investigation of this compound including clinical symptoms, pathological signs, cytokine profiles, histological structure and inflammasomes using relevant bioassay protocols.Capnoidine-treated mice had significantly: a) improved clinical symptoms (body weight loss, mobility, piloerection and faecal consistency); b) reduced colon pathology (adhesion, oedema, ulceration, and colon length); c) altered inflammatory cytokines profiles within the colons; d) reduced levels of p-IκB-α (Ser32) and p-NF-κB p65 (Ser536) and e) reduced histological inflammation in the colon when compared with mice administered TNBS only.Capnoidine presents as a potential new anti-inflammatory drug lead candidate for diseases where current standard-of-care often fails and is associated with major side effects. It also validates the traditional uses of C. dubia against inflammatory conditions and underlines the value of pursuing bioactive compounds derived from traditionally used ethnobotanical medicines.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We planned to to evaluate the prevalence of Blastocystis spp. in patients who applied to the same internal medicine-gastroenterology clinic with or without gastrointestinal complaints to reveal the association of this parasite with diagnosed IBS and IBD.A total of 2334 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms composed the study group, which included 335 patients with diagnosed  and 877 with irritable  syndrome. Patients without any gastrointestinal symptoms or  (n = 192) composed the control group. Parasite presence was investigated by applying native-Lugol and formol ethyl  concentration to stool specimens, and trichrome staining method in suspicious cases.Blastocystis spp. was detected in 134 patients (5.74%) in the study group and 6 (3.12%) in the control group (p = 0.128). In the study group, Blastocystis spp. was detected at frequencies of 8.7% in ulcerative colitis (24/276), 6.78% in Crohn's  (4/59), 5.82% in irritable  syndrome (51/877), and 4.9% in the remaining patients with gastrointestinal symptoms (55/1122). Blastocystis spp. was detected at a statistically significant ratio in the  (odds ratio [OR] = 2.824; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.149-6.944; p = 0.019) and ulcerative colitis (OR = 2.952; 95% CI: 1.183-7.367; p = 0.016) patients within this group compared to controls. There were no statistically significant differences between the control group and Crohn's  or irritable  syndrome patients in terms Blastocystis spp. frequency (p = 0.251, p = 0.133).Blastocystosis was more frequent in patients with , especially those with ulcerative colitis.

The reported rate averages 8 percent and has been attributed to tissue ischemia, localized sepsis, anastomotic leak, proximal fecal diversion, radiation injury, , and recurrent rectal cancer. Most patients will have symptoms of obstipation, frequent small  movements, and bloating. Symptomatic strictures are often approached by dilation (balloon or Hegar) or less often repeat resection. Many of these patients have anastomoses that are too low to consider repeat resection. Strictureplasty with linear stapling devices, stricture resection by use of the circular stapling device, and repeat dilations have all been described. Steroid injections into the stricture have been described in strictured esophagogastric anastomoses but have not been commonly used for strictured coloproctostomies. We describe three cases of coloanal stricture following resections that were complicated by postoperative pelvic abcesses, anastomatic leaks, and pelvic fibrosis. Two cases had undergone low coloanal anastomosis that was protected by a loop ileostomy and developed as significant stricture in the early postoperative period. The third case was managed without a protective loop ileostomy. These were initially managed by repeated dilation of the anastomosis. Each episode was followed by rapid recurrence of the stricture. All patients underwent subsequent dilation with injection of 40 mg of triamcinolone  (divided dose in four quadrants) into the stricture and subsequent complete resolution of the stricture. Those patients with loop ileostomies had them taken down and all have been followed for up to 12 months without clinical or endoscopic evidence of recurrent stricture.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16446495>Redox state and O2*- production in neutrophils of Crohn's  patients.</a></h2><p>The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the intracellular redox state and respiratory burst (RB) in neutrophils of patients with Crohn's  (CD). The intracellular redox state and RB in neutrophils was assessed by the superoxide anion (O2*-) production induced in these cells after stimulation by various factors related to the molecular mechanisms that, if altered, may be responsible for an abnormal immune response. This can, in part, cause the onset of inflammation and tissue damage seen in CD. This study demonstrated a decreased glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) ratio index of an increased oxidative state in CD patient neutrophils. Moreover, our findings showed a decrease in tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha)- or phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA)-induced O2*- production in CD patient neutrophils adherent to fibronectin as compared with controls. A decreased adhesion was also demonstrated. For this reason, the involvement of altered mechanisms of protein kinase C (PKC) and beta-integrin activation in CD patient neutrophils is suggested. These data also showed that the harmful effects of TNF-alpha cannot be caused by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced by neutrophils. Decreased cell viability after a prolonged time of adhesion (20 hrs) was also measured in CD patient neutrophils. The findings of this study demonstrate, for the first time, that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a compound recently used in CD therapy, is able to activate the RB for a prolonged time both in control and CD patient neutrophils. Increased viability of CD patient neutrophils caused by GM-CSF stimulation was also observed. In conclusion, our results indicate that decreased O2*- production and adhesion, caused, in part, by an anomalous response to TNF-alpha, together with low GSH level and low cell viability, may be responsible for the defective neutrophil function found in CD patients. This can contribute to the chronic inflammation and relapses that characterize this pathology. A possible role of GM-CSF in inducing O2*- production and in restoring the defensive role of neutrophils in CD patients is suggested.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25971649>Management of endocrine disease: Secondary osteoporosis: pathophysiology and management.</a></h2><p>Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by decreased mass and compromised bone strength predisposing to an increased risk of fractures.

T. catigua bark extracts possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and bactericidal properties. These properties suggest T. catigua bark extracts as a potential treatment for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Using the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced model of  in rats we evaluated the effect of an ethyl- fraction (EAF) of T. catigua (200 mg/kg) administered by daily oral gavage or intrarectally at different time points after TNBS challenge. TNBS treatment evoked severe colonic inflammation after 24 h that persisted for 7 days, characterized by weight loss, high levels of myeloperoxidase activity, histological and macroscopic damage, and elevated index of oxidative stress in the blood. T. catigua EAF treatment prevented the oxidative stress within 24 h and enhanced tissue recovery observed at day 7, returning histological and macroscopic damage levels to that of the control group. TNBS treatment led to loss of myenteric neurons after 28 days. T. catigua EAF was unable to prevent the neuronal loss. Oral delivery of T. catigua EAF was more effective than intrarectal administration of the extract. In conclusion, T. catigua EAF treatment normalized oxidative stress parameters in blood and reduced the degree of acute inflammation in TNBS .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We wished to reveal the novel function of this herb and its active component on barrier function in intestinal epithelial cells. Monolayers of intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2) were used to evaluate the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and quantity of permeated ovalbumin (OVA) as indices of barrier function. T. caulis increased TEER values on cell monolayers and decreased OVA permeation across cell monolayers. To ascertain the active component of T. caulis, the extract was isolated to five fractions, and the effect of each of these fractions on intestinal barrier function examined. Chloroform and ethyl  fractions showed increased TEER values and decreased OVA flux. Chloroform and ethyl  fractions contained mainly trachelogenin and its glycoside, tracheloside. Trachelogenin increased TEER values and decreased OVA flux by enhancing the tight-junction protein occludin (but not tracheloside) in Caco-2 monolayers. These findings demonstrated that trachelogenin, an active component of T. caulis, might help to attenuate food allergy or inflammatory bowel disease through inhibition of allergen permeation or enhancement of the intestinal barrier.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26102563>CARD15 gene overexpression reduces effect of etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab on cytokine secretion from PMA activated U937 cells.</a></h2><p>Crohn's disease (CD), a subcategory of inflammatory bowel disease, is an immune-related disorder characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal mucosa, which can take place in any region along the alimentary tract. The most important gene involved in the etiology of CD is NOD2/CARD15 located on chromosome 16. It has been shown that CARD15 is overexpressed in monocytes of CD patients. The common treatment for the disease is anti-TNF-alpha drugs, the most hopeful of which are probably infliximab and etanercept. Infliximab rapidly reduces signs and symptoms of active Crohn's disease. In contrast, etanercept shows no such effect. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of the CARD15 gene overexpression in monocytic cell line U937 in the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, and proinflammatory cytokine, Il-1 beta, produced after incubation with infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept separately. Our results show that infliximab and adalimumab significantly decreased IL-10 and IL-1beta secretion levels. However, etanercept inhibition of secretion was less compared with infliximab or adalimumab. In all three cases, suppression of cytokine production is reduced by CARD15 overexpression.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the human colon, both toxins cause intestinal inflammation and stimulate tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) expression via the activation of NF-κB. It is well established that the macrolide antibiotic fidaxomicin is associated with reduced relapses of  infection. We showed that fidaxomicin and its primary metabolite OP-1118 significantly inhibited toxin A-mediated intestinal inflammation in mice  and toxin A-induced cell rounding  We aim to determine whether fidaxomicin and OP-1118 possess anti-inflammatory effects against toxin A and toxin B in the human colon and examine the mechanism of this response. We used fresh human colonic explants, NCM460 human colonic epithelial cells, and RAW264.7 mouse macrophages to study the mechanism of the activity of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 against toxin A- and B-mediated cytokine expression and apoptosis. Fidaxomicin and OP-1118 dose-dependently inhibited toxin A- and B-induced TNF-α and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) mRNA expression and histological damage in human colonic explants. Fidaxomicin and OP-1118 inhibited toxin A-mediated NF-κB phosphorylation in human and mouse intestinal mucosae. Fidaxomicin and OP-1118 also inhibited toxin A-mediated NF-κB phosphorylation and TNF-α expression in macrophages, which was reversed by the NF-κB activator phorbol myristate  (PMA). Fidaxomicin and OP-1118 prevented toxin A- and B-mediated apoptosis in NCM460 cells, which was reversed by the addition of PMA. PMA reversed the cytoprotective effect of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 in toxin-exposed human colonic explants.

The number of circulating Treg cells and the level of Foxp3 expression increase during granulocyte and monocyte apheresis (GMA), a useful therapy for ulcerative colitis. However, the mechanism underlying GMA-induced Foxp3 expression is unknown. We found that the level of TGF-beta mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was augmented just after treatment of peripheral blood with a GMA carrier, cellulose  beads, in vitro and that Foxp3 expression in PBMCs increased after culturing these cells for 5 days after the treatment. The augmentation of TGF-beta expression was observed in CD3(-) PBMCs but not in CD3(+) T cells. Furthermore, the increase in Foxp3 expression in T cells depended on co-culture with CD3(-) PBMCs. We conclude that cellulose  beads have an ability to induce Foxp3 expression in peripheral blood T cells via augmentation of TGF-beta expression in CD3(-) PBMCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25630423>Prostaglandin E₂ and polyenylphosphatidylcholine protect against intestinal fibrosis and regulate myofibroblast function.</a></h2><p>Intestinal fibrosis is a serious and often recurrent complication of  despite surgical intervention. The anti-fibrotic potential of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and polyenylphosphatidylcholine (PC) was investigated using the murine model of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced chronic intestinal inflammation and fibrosis, and murine and human intestinal myofibroblasts.Mice were treated with TNBS enemas weekly for 2 or 6 weeks ± PGE2 (10 mg/kg/day orally) or PC (200 mg/kg/day orally). Inflammation and fibrosis were histologically assessed and scored. Pro- cytokines, TLR4, and ECM-related gene expression from the colonic tissue and cultured myofibroblasts were assessed by RT-qPCR. The levels of α-SMA(+) staining and endogenous PGE2 in vivo were also assessed.Both PGE2 and PC treatment significantly decreased TNBS-induced intestinal inflammation and excess collagen deposition in vivo. This was accompanied by decreased α-SMA(+) staining in the lamina propria and lower collagen type I (COL1α1) expression. Endogenous PGE2 levels demonstrated that PC was not being converted into PGE2, thus mediating its effects primarily via PGE2-independent pathways. Both PGE2 and the PC isoform, 1,2-dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), regulated primary mouse myofibroblast and CCD-18co COL1α1 production, and induced lower collagen type I to III and TGF-β1 to TGF-β3 ratios, demonstrating their ability to induced normal healing in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13- (protein kinase C-dependent inducer of collagen production).PGE2 and PC both have potent anti-fibrogenic potentials in their ability to regulate  cell and myofibroblast accumulation within inflamed tissue, to decrease pro- cytokine expression and to maintain normal healing in an  environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27802154>Interplay of host genetics and gut microbiota underlying the onset and clinical presentation of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Patients with IBD display substantial heterogeneity in clinical characteristics.

FOXP3 inhibits IL-17A production, but a naturally occurring splice variant of FOXP3 lacking exon 2 (Δexon2) cannot.We hypothesized that IBD patients preferentially express the Δexon2 variant of FOXP3 so the paradoxically increased mucosal Tregs in IBD could represent cells expressing only Δexon2.We used antibodies and primers that can distinguish between the full-length and Δexon2 splice variant of FOXP3 to evaluate expression of these isoforms in human intestinal tissue by immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively.No difference in the expression pattern of Δexon2 relative to full-length FOXP3 was seen in ulcerative colitis or Crohn's  versus non-IBD controls. By immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, we also did not find individual cells which expressed FOXP3 protein exclusively in the Δexon2 isoform in either IBD or control tissue. FOXP3+ mucosal CD4+ T cells from both IBD and control specimens were able to make IL-17A in vitro after phorbol myristate  (PMA) and ionomycin stimulation, but these cells did not preferentially express Δexon2.Our data do not support the hypothesis that selective expression of FOXP3 in the Δexon2 isoform accounts for the inability of copious FOXP3+ T cells to inhibit inflammation or IL-17 expression in IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19655374>Chitosan/Kollicoat SR 30D film-coated pellets of aminosalicylates for colonic drug delivery.</a></h2><p>The purpose of the study was to (i) prepare the chitosan/Kollicoat SR 30D film-coated pellets for colonic drug delivery, and (ii) evaluate the colonic delivery and efficacy of these coated pellets in the rat. The pellets were coated to different film thickness with chitosan/Kollicoat SR 30D formulations. In vitro drug release was assessed in simulated gastrointestinal (GI) tract conditions.

A recent developed in vitro dynamic gut model, the M-SHIME, was used to compare long-term colonization of the mucin layer by the microbiota from six healthy volunteers (HV) and six UC patients and thus distinguish the mucin adhered from the luminal microbiota. Although under the same nutritional conditions, short-chain fatty acid production by the luminal communities from UC patients showed a tendency toward a lower butyrate production. A more in-depth community analysis of those microbial groups known to produce butyrate revealed that the diversity of the Clostridium coccoides/Eubacterium rectale and Clostridium leptum group, and counts of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were lower in the luminal fractions of the UC samples. Counts of Roseburia spp. were lower in the mucosal fractions of the UC samples. qPCR analysis for butyryl-CoA: CoA transferase, responsible for butyrate production, displayed a lower abundance in both the luminal and mucosal fractions of the UC samples.

We also report the results of screening for CAC preventive agents from EIR via a nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) translocation model in Caco2 cells, since activated NF-κB can be used by tumor cells at the early stage of tumorigenesis. Twenty-four components were isolated from EIR and identified by multiple chromatography and spectral analysis. MTT experiments in IEC-6 and RAW264.7 cells showed that all 24 compounds were toxic-free to normal cell lines. Furthermore, compound rotundic acid (RA) (19) exhibited an inhibitory effect on LPS-induced NF-κB translocation in Caco2 cells. Moreover, RA did not induce apoptosis in Caco2 tumor cells while possessing an anti-inflammatory effect both in immune and intestinal epithelium cells (RAW264.7 and IEC-6 cells, respectively). Removing RA (19) and its 28-O-glucopyranoside (17) from EIR definitely undermined the in vivo CAC preventive activity of EIR. Therefore, the current study suggested that RA (19) could be a potential therapeutic agent against CAC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23060857>Short-chain free fatty acid receptors FFA2/GPR43 and FFA3/GPR41 as new potential therapeutic targets.</a></h2><p>The deorphanization of the free fatty acid (FFA) receptors FFA1 (GPR40), FFA2 (GPR43), FFA3 (GPR41), GPR84, and GPR120 has made clear that the body is capable of recognizing and responding directly to nonesterified fatty acid of virtually any chain length. Colonic fermentation of dietary fiber produces high concentrations of the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) , propionate and butyrate, a process which is important to health. The phylogenetically related 7-transmembrane (7TM) receptors free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2) and FFA3 are activated by these SCFAs, and several lines of evidence indicate that FFA2 and FFA3 mediate beneficial effects associated with a fiber-rich diet, and that they may be of interest as targets for treatment of  and metabolic . FFA2 is highly expressed on immune cells, in particular neutrophils, and several studies suggest that the receptor plays a role in  involving a dysfunctional neutrophil response, such as  (IBD). Both FFA2 and FFA3 have been implicated in metabolic  such as type 2 diabetes and in regulation of appetite. More research is however required to clarify the potential of the receptors as drug targets and establish if activation or inhibition would be the preferred mode of action. The availability of potent and selective receptor modulators is a prerequisite for these studies. The few modulators of FFA2 or FFA3 that have been published hitherto in the peer-reviewed literature in general have properties that make them less than ideal as such tools, but published patent applications indicate that better tool compounds might soon become available which should enable studies critical to validate the receptors as new drug targets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26297475>High levels of fish oil enhance neutrophil development and activation and influence colon mucus barrier function in a genetically susceptible mouse model.</a></h2><p>Dietary fatty acids influence immunologic homeostasis, but their effect on initiation of , an immune-mediated disease, is not well established. Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that high doses of dietary fish oil (FO) increased colon inflammation and dysplasia in a model of infection-induced . In the current study, we assessed the effects of high-dose dietary FO, 6% by weight, on colon inflammation, neutrophil recruitment and function, and mucus layer integrity in a genetically susceptible, -prone mouse model in the absence of infection. FO-fed SMAD3(-/-) mice had increased colon inflammation evidenced by increased numbers of systemic and local neutrophils and increased neutrophil chemoattractant and inflammatory cytokine gene expression in the colon. Mucus layer thickness in the cecum and goblet cell numbers in the cecum and colon in FO-fed mice were reduced compared to control. FO consumption affected  in male and female mice differently. Compared to female control mice, neutrophils from FO-fed female mice had reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon ex vivo stimulation with phorbol myristate  while FO-fed male mice produced increased ROS compared to control-fed male mice. In summary, dietary FO impaired mucus layer integrity and was associated with colon inflammation characterized by increased neutrophil numbers and altered neutrophil function. High-dose FO may have detrimental effects in populations genetically susceptible for inflammatory bowel disease and these effects may differ between males and females.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Accurate diagnosis of  (IBD) at an early stage, and correct differentiation between Crohn's  (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is important for optimum treatment and prognosis. We present here the first characterization of fecal extracts obtained from patients with CD and UC by employing a noninvasive metabonomics approach, which combines high resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy and multivariate pattern recognition techniques. The fecal extracts of both CD and UC patients were characterized by reduced levels of butyrate, , methylamine, and trimethylamine in comparison with a control population, suggesting changes in the gut microbial community. Also, elevated quantities of amino acids were present in the feces from both  groups, implying malabsorption caused by the   or an element of protein losing enteropathy. Metabolic differences in fecal profiles were more marked in the CD group in comparison with the control group, indicating that the inflammation caused by CD is more extensive in comparison with UC and involves the whole intestine. Furthermore, glycerol resonances were a dominant feature of fecal spectra from patients with CD but were present in much lower intensity in the control and UC groups.

Caraway fruits are used as flavoring agent in foods and beverages, and have various traditional uses in ethnomedicine. Anti-, spasmolytic, antimicrobial, antioxidant, carminative and immunomodulatory properties of caraway suggest that it might exert beneficial effects on  (IBD). Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the effects of caraway hydroalcoholic extract (CHE) and its essential oil (CEO) in an immunological model of colitis in rats induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Different doses of CHE (100, 200, 400 mg/kg) and CEO (100, 200, 400 μl/kg) were administered orally (p.o.) and also doses of CHE (100, 400 mg/kg) and CEO (100, 400 μl/kg) were given intraperitoneally (i.p.) to the separate groups of male Wistar rats (n=6). Administration of the doses started 6 h after induction of colitis and continued daily for 5 consecutive days. Wet colon weight/length ratio was measured and tissue damage scores as well as indices of colitis were evaluated both macroscopically and histopathologically. CHE and CEO at all doses tested were effective in reducing colon tissue lesions and colitis indices and the efficacy was nearly the same when different doses of plant fractions were administered p.o. or i.p. Administration of prednisolone (p.o., 4 mg/kg), Asacol® (mesalazine microgranules, p.o., 100 mg/kg) and hydrocortisone  (i.p., 20 mg/kg) as references were effective in reducing colon tissue injures as well. These data suggest that caraway fractions are both effective and possess anti-colitic activity irrespective of the dose and route of administration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28661094>Effect of Temperature on Granulocyte and Monocyte Adsorption to Cellulose  Beads.</a></h2><p>Granulocyte and monocyte (GM) adsorptive apheresis (GMA) is an effective therapy for inflammatory disorders including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). During GMA, the blood of a patient with IBD passes through a column to contact cellulose  (CA) beads at a temperature below body temperature, likely close to room temperature. Here we investigated the effect of temperature on GM adsorption to CA beads in vitro. We incubated peripheral blood with and without CA beads at 5°C, 25°C, 37°C, and 43°C and calculated the ratios of adsorbed GMs. The ratios of adsorbed GMs increased as the temperature was raised. Additionally, we measured complement activation fragment concentrations. C3a and C5a concentrations also increased as the temperature was raised, and C5a concentrations had a positive correlation with the ratios of adsorbed GMs. These results suggest that warming the column during GMA might increase GM adsorption to CA beads, thereby enhancing the clinical efficacy of GMA.© 2017 International Society for Apheresis, Japanese Society for Apheresis, and Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18186103>Curcumin in cancer management: recent results of analogue design and clinical studies and desirable future research.</a></h2><p>The ability of the curry constituent curcumin to delay the onset of cancer has been the topic of extensive research for many years.

Patients received up to 10 Adacolumn sessions over 12 weeks, one session was 60-90 min at 30 mL/min. No additional medication was given. Efficacy was assessed with Seo's activity index (AI) [Seo M, Okada M, Yao T. An index of  activity in patients with ulcerative colitis. Am J Gastroenterol 1992;87:971-6]. The mean AL was 197.5 and range 154.4-277.7. AI < 150 was considered significant improvement and AI < 100 was considered clinical remission.Of 60 patients, 50 (83.3 %) improved, 14 achieved remission, granulocytapheresis was most effective in steroid-dependent patients. At entry, the mean dose of prednisolone was 15.3 mg/day per patient and was reduced to 3.6 mg/day after 10 sessions. Granulocytapheresis was well tolerated and no serious side-effects were observed.Based on our experience in patients with diverse ulcerative colitis  expression and long-term exposure to conventional drug therapy, we believe that granulocytapheresis is an effective adjunct to conventional medication for promoting remission and sparing steroids in patients with active ulcerative colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25598851> kinase Activity and Kinetic Properties of the Enzyme in Desulfovibrio piger Vib-7 and Desulfomicrobium sp.

In addition to inflammation and demyelination, widespread axonal and neuronal pathologies are central components of this . MS therapies aim to restrain the pathological processes, enhance protective mechanisms, and prevent  progression. The amino acid copolymer, glatiramer  (GA, Copaxone), an approved treatment for MS, has a unique mode of action. Evidence from the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and from MS patients indicates that GA affects various levels of the innate and the adaptive immune response, inducing deviation from the pro- to the anti- pathways. This includes competition for the binding of antigen presenting cells, driving dendritic cells, monocytes, and B-cells towards anti- responses, induction of Th2/3 and T-regulatory cells, and downregulating of both Th1 and Th-17 cells. The immune cells induced by GA reach the inflamed  organ and secrete in situ anti- cytokines alleviating the pathological processes. Furthermore, cumulative findings have revealed that in addition to its immunomodulatory activities GA promotes neuroprotective repair processes such as neurotrophic factors secretion and remyelination. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview on the diverse mechanism of action of GA in EAE/MS, in particular on the in situ effect of GA and its ability to generate neuroprotection and repair in the CNS. In view of its immunomodulatory activity, the beneficial effects of GA in various models of additional autoimmune related pathologies, such as immune rejection and  (IBD), are also presented.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, IL-32 has been primarily studied in  models such as rheumatoid arthritis and . The regulation of endogenous IL-32 in other immune cells remains unknown. In the present study, we stimulated Jurkat T cells with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and phorbol myristate  (PMA) and examined IL-32 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. All mRNAs of the four IL-32 isoforms and the 12-15 kDa IL-32 protein were independent of PHA and PMA stimulation, however a 9 kDa molecular weight IL-32 protein in the cell culture supernatant was induced by PHA and PMA after 16 h of stimulation. Compared to other human cell lines, the Jurkat cell line constitutively expressed a 12-15 kDa molecule of IL-32, which is smaller than the known IL-32 isoforms. We used IL-32 shRNA to examine the specificity of the 12-15 kDa molecule. Upon IL-32 shRNA transfection, the 12-15 kDa band was decreased specifically as compared to the control scrambled clone. Thus, the constitutive expression of IL-32 mRNA as well as the predominant production of a smaller sized IL-32 isoform in Jurkat cells may implicate a role for IL-32 in human T cell leukemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30775453>Analysis of pH Dose-dependent Growth of Sulfate-reducing Bacteria.</a></h2><p>Lower intraluminal colonic pH is an indication for the development of inflammatory bowel disease including active ulcerative . Involvement of intestinal sulfate-reducing bacteria in decreasing bowel pH by the production of HS and  as well as their sensitivity has never been reported before. The study of the relative pH and survival of  Vib-7 by monitoring sulfate reduction parameters was the aim of this work. Monitoring was done through the measurement of bacterial growth (biomass), dissimilatory sulfate reduction parameters: sulfate consumption, lactate oxidation, hydrogen sulfide and  production. According to our results, we observed that lower pH (<5) significantly inhibited  Vib-7 growth. This inhibition was also noticed when alkaline media (>9 pH) was used, though the reduction was not at the rate as in media with pH of 4. The research indicates that the growth of  Vib-7 is inhibited at pH of 4 which is not as low as the pH found in people with severely developed inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative . Certainly the interaction (synergistic effect) between both hydrogen sulfide and  accumulation can also play an important etiological role in the development of bowel inflammation in humans and animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28437455>Effect of a probiotic beverage consumption (Enterococcus faecium CRL 183 and Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707) in rats with chemically induced .</a></h2><p>Some probiotic strains have the potential to assist in relieving the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.

The animals were randomly assigned into five groups: Group C: negative control; Group CL: positive control; Group CLF: DSS with the fermented product; Group CLP: DSS with the non-fermented product (placebo); Group CLS: DSS with sulfasalazine. The following parameters were monitored: disease activity index, fecal microbial analyses, gastrointestinal survival of probiotic microorganisms and short-chain fatty acids concentration in the feces. At the end of the protocol the animals' colons were removed so as to conduct a macroscopical and histopathological analysis, cytokines and nitrite quantification.Animals belonging to the CLF group showed fewer symptoms of  during the induction period and a lower degree of inflammation and ulceration in their colon compared to the CL, CLS and CLP groups (p<0.05). The colon of the animals in groups CL and CLS presented severe crypt damage, which was absent in CLF and CLP groups. A significant increase in the population of Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. at the end of the protocol was verified only in the CLF animals (p<0.05).

Furthermore, the intestinal survival of E. faecium CRL 183 and B. longum ATCC 15707 in the CLF group has been confirmed by biochemical and molecular analyzes.The obtained results suggest that a regular intake of the probiotic product, and placebo to a lesser extent, can reduce the severity of DSS-induced  on rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29889427>EFFECT OF CARBOXYLIC ACIDS OF GUT MICROBIAL ORIGIN ON HOST CELL PROLIFERATION IN ORGANOTYPIC TISSUE CULTURES.</a></h2><p>Intestinal microbiota produces many carboxylic acids, especially short chain fatty acids (SCFA) as a result of carbohydrates, fats and proteins fermentation and which are intermediates in the interaction of the microbiota and the host. SCFA (formate, , propionate, butyrate) are formed by the anaerobic carbohydrates fermentation and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA), such as isobutyric and isovaleric acids, are derived from amino acids valine and leucine. Phenylcarboxylic acids (PCA), such as phenylacetic acid (PAA), phenyipropionic acid (PPA), phenyllactic acid (PLA) and some other acids, are metabolites of amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine involved in host adaptation and regulation. ma unique experiment, the authors first examined effect of the carboxylic acids on host cell proliferation in organotypic tissue cultures (rat spleen explants). The study showed that almost all biogenic aliphatic carboxylic acids have a positive effect on cell proliferation in rat spleen tissue. This fundamentally distinguishes them from amino acids, many of which have an inhibitory effect at the same concentrations. These findings suggest that SCFA, including hydrox~ and oxo derivatives, can act as positive regulators of host immune tissues. Some SCFA (for example, butyric acid), stimulate proliferation of normal host cells (immune tissue, intestinal epithelium), but inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells ('butyrate paradox'). Unlike SCFA, phenylcarboxylic acids have a negative effect on host immune tissues explants and induce apoptosis. These data confirm the potential contribution of phenylcarboxylic acids in the pathogenesis of chronic disorders associated with impaired immune response, including autoimmune diseases. The authors suggest that PCA may serve as early metabolic markers of sepsis, immune-related diseases and chronic inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (iBD), colorectal cancer, chronic kidney disease and liver, secondary imrnunodeficiency. It can be assumed that carboxylic acids are evolutionary precursors of amino acids that have a wide variety of functions and able to modulate not only proliferation but also apoptosis. The results agree well with the data obtained in the study of Actoflor-C (microbial metabolites complex) and can be used to study mechanisms of action of probiotic strains and metabiotics (e.g. butyrate and propionate-containing formulations), as well as for the development of innovative medicines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27787408>Chronic Psychosocial Stress and Gut Health in Children: Associations With Calprotectin and Fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acids.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms underpinning the association between chronic stress and gut health are poorly understood. We aimed to investigate the relationship between bacterial produced short-chain fatty acids, gut barrier function, and stress measures.A fecal sample, hair sample, and questionnaire data were collected from 113 Belgian children (8-16 years old). Biological measures of stress included hair cortisol (most proximal 3 cm) and 5-minute heart rate variability (high frequency). Self-report measures of stress included emotional problems and negative events. Fecal calprotectin was determined as a marker of intestinal inflammation and an indirect indicator of gut barrier integrity. Fecal short-chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate, , valerate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate) were measured with gas chromatography. Linear regression analyses were adjusted for sex, age, socioeconomic status, body mass index, fiber intake, and protein intake.Emotional problems were significantly associated with higher butyrate (β = 0.263), valerate (β = 0.230), isovalerate (β = 0.231), and isobutyrate (β = 0.233). Heart rate variability reflecting higher parasympathetic activity was related to lower valerate levels (β = -0.217). Hair cortisol was not associated with the short-chain fatty acids. None of the stress measures and none of the fecal short-chain fatty acids were significantly related to fecal calprotectin.In healthy children, the impact of chronic stress is manifested more obviously in short-chain fatty acids than in intestinal inflammation as measured by levels of calprotectin. Despite the rather counterintuitive associations with butyrate, these results point to the need for further research on gut microbiome composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25651187>Noni (Morinda citrifolia L.)

This study explored the effects of the immunomodulator glatiramer  (GA; Copaxone) treatment on syndecan-1 expression in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Acute and chronic colitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by 2 and 1.5% DSS in tap water, respectively. GA was applied subcutaneously, 2 mg per mouse per day, starting on the day of DSS induction until the mice were sacrificed. Syndecan-1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The effect of adoptive transfer of GA-specific T cells as an organ-specific therapy also was evaluated. Syndecan-1 expression was significantly lower in both colitis groups compared with that in naive mice (p < 0.0001). GA attenuated clinical scores and pathological manifestations of colitis and led to the reinstatement of normal levels of syndecan-1. After adoptive transfer, GA-specific cells homed to the surface epithelium of the distal colon, accompanied by the augmentation of syndecan-1 staining in their vicinity. We concluded that syndecan-1 expression is reduced in DSS-induced colitis and could be a potential prognostic factor in IBD. Treatment with GA exerts not only an anti- effect but also a possible beneficial effect in stabilizing the intestinal epithelium barrier and tissue repair in DSS colitis. GA may be applied as a novel drug for IBD, shifting treatment from immunosuppression toward immunomodulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19298254>Loss of Ca-mediated ion transport during colitis correlates with reduced ion transport responses to a Ca-activated K channel opener.</a></h2><p>Epithelial surface hydration is critical for proper gut function. However, colonic tissues from individuals with  or animals with colitis are hyporesponsive to Cl(-) secretagogues. The Cl(-) secretory responses to the muscarinic receptor agonist bethanechol are virtually absent in colons of mice with dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced colitis. Our aim was to define the mechanism underlying this cholinergic hyporesponsiveness.Colitis was induced by 4% DSS water, given orally. Epithelial ion transport was measured in Ussing chambers. Colonic crypts were isolated and processed for mRNA expression via RT-PCR and protein expression via immunoblotting and immunolocalization.Expression of muscarinic M(3) receptors in colonic epithelium was not decreased during colitis. Short-circuit current (I(SC)) responses to other Ca(2+)-dependent secretagogues (histamine, thapsigargin, cyclopiazonic acid and calcium ionophore) were either absent or severely attenuated in colonic tissue from DSS-treated mice. mRNA levels of several ion transport molecules (a Ca(2+)-regulated Cl(-) channel, the intermediate-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase pump or the Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) co-transporter) were not reduced in colonic crypts from DSS-treated mice. However, protein expression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunits was decreased twofold during colitis. Activation of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels increased I(SC) significantly less in DSS colons compared with control, as did the protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-.Decreased Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase expression probably contributes to overall epithelial hyporesponsiveness during colitis, while dysfunctional K(+) channels may account, at least partially, for lack of epithelial secretory responses to Ca(2+)-mediated secretagogues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24465012>Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus inhibits the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps.</a></h2><p>Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are an essential component of the antimicrobial repertoire and represent an effective means by which neutrophils capture, contain, and kill microorganisms.

Moreover, probiotic L. rhamnosus strain GG had potent antioxidative activity: dampening reactive oxygen species production and phagocytic capacity of the neutrophils while protecting against cell cytotoxicity.

The authors propose to describe the key microbiora using term 'phylometabolic core of intestinal microbioca which more accurately reflects the functional importance of metabolically active microbiota. Phylometabolic core includes functional groups of microorganisms that perform similar metabolic functions: butyrate-producing bacteria, propionate-producing bacteria, -produc- ing bacteria (acerogens), hydrogenosrophic microorganisms (reductive acetogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogens), lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria, bacteria involved in bile acids metabolism, bacteria that metabolize proteins and amino acids, vitamin-producing microorganisms, oxalate-degrading bacteria and others. The hypothesis that disturbance of microbial metabolism is the root of many human diseases is discussed. The microbial dysmexabo- lism leads to the metabolic dysbiosis (a particular form of dysbiosis) that is primarily characterized by metabolic abnormalities (e.g. serum, urinary, fetal or exhaled air). Metabolic dysbiosis is not necessarily accompanied by appreciable quantitative and/or qualitative changes in microbiora composition that called taxonomic dysbiosis. Since in the metabolic dysbiosis metabolic pathways can be switched only, it means the need for completely different approaches to its assessment using metabolomics (metabolic fingerprinting, metabolic profiling, meta-metabolomics). Metabolites concentrations in colon (feces, biopsy samples), blood (serum, plasma), urine or exhaled air, as well as metabolic profiles of examined substrates can serve as biomarkers. The main clinical variants of metabolic dysbiosis are due to the disturbances in microbial synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (primarily butyrate and propionate) and due to increasing bacterial production of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and secondary bile acids (particularly deoxycholic acid). These kinds of metabolic dysbiosis can eventually lead to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colorectal cancer (CRC). The metabolic dysbiosis due to bacterial choline dysmetabolism followed by overproduction of trimethylamine (TMA), arherogenic precursor of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), is associated with atherogenesis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Dysmetabolism of aromatic amino acids leads to changes in the microbial production of phenylalanine and tyrosine derivatives (phenyl carboxylic acid, p-cresol) and tryptophan indole derivatives (indole carboxylic acid, indole) and contributes to pathogenesis in lBS. IBD, CRC, chronic liver and kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, autism and schizophrenia. Metabiotics, a new class of therapeutic agents, e.g. based on microbial metabolites, can correct metabolic dysbiosis, prevent diet- and microbiota-relared diseases and increase the effectiveness of treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20735154>New prebiotics from rice bran ameliorate inflammation in murine colitis models through the modulation of intestinal homeostasis and the mucosal immune system.</a></h2><p>Enzyme-treated rice fiber (ERF) is a recently developed prebiotic product made from rice bran by heat-resistant amylase, protease and hemicellulase treatment. Although the detailed mechanism of  (IBD) is still unclear, the role of the resident luminal bacteria and its interaction on the mucosal barrier seem to be an important factor in the development of IBD and its chronicity. With the objective of manipulating the intestinal microbiota in IBD, this study was carried out to evaluate the effects of ERF on IBD with using experimental colitis models.Three colitis models were used and they were induced by the oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate in male Sprague-Dawley rats or BALB/c mice and transferring CD4+ CD45RB(high) T cells to female SCID mice, sequentially their CD4+ T cells were retransferred to new SCID mice. The evaluation included the measurement of body weight, spleen weight, colon length, histological examination, serum and mucosal cytokine (tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), an interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-12 p70 (IL-12p70), IL-1β, IL-6, IL-4) analysis, mucosal serotonin (5HT), and organic acid production and a microbiota analysis of the cecal contents. The characteristics of T cell surface markers including CD4, CD69, CD45RB of spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were also analyzed. In addition, the effects of ERF on the change in the induction of dendritic cells (DCs) were evaluated.The preventive effect of ERF on colitis was significantly superior to that of raw material rice bran or control group. An overexpression of  cytokine production was attenuated by ERF treatment, which was accompanied with a decrease in both the colonic mucosal damage and 5HT production. Furthermore, ERF significantly attenuated the T cell activation (CD4+CD69+) of spleen and MLN, and this characteristic was inherited by the retransferred mice. ERF significantly suppressed the growth of Clostiridium, and increased short-chain fatty acids (, propionate and butyrate) content in colitis. The relatively hydrophilic fraction of ERF (ethanol-methanol soluble fraction) is therefore considered to have a potent ability to attenuate the induction of DCs.A new prebiotic, ERF, reduced inflammation by modulating the colonic environment and regulating immune cell differentiation. Although a more detailed study is required, this study showed the promising anti- effects of an adjunctive prebiotic treatment for IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25445404>The diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease is often unsupported in clinical practice.</a></h2><p>The diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease can be challenging and requires the efforts of a multidisciplinary team. We performed a retrospective analysis with the aim of evaluating the adequacy of the prerequisites for arriving at an accurate histological diagnosis.The following parameters were considered as prerequisites for a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease: clinical and endoscopic data; proper sampling and handling of biopsies; and elementary microscopic lesions. We collected 345 cases from 13 centres.The date of onset and treatment were available for 13% and 16% of the cases, respectively. Endoscopy information was accessible for 77% of the cases. Endoscopic mapping was completed in 13% of the cases. In no cases were the biopsies oriented on  strips. The diagnosis was conclusive in 47% of the cases. Activity, epithelial disruption and crypt distortion were described in 35% of the reports with a conclusive diagnosis.Our study showed that the diagnostic prerequisites were widely unfulfilled, although approximately half of the diagnoses were conclusive for inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, in our assessment of clinical practice: (1) clinicians seldom provide suitable clinical and/or endoscopic information for a histological diagnosis and (2) histopathological diagnoses of inflammatory bowel disease are often not supported by morphology.Copyright © 2014 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

However, the effect of alpinetin on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not yet been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect and mechanism of alpinetin on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  in mice. In vivo, DSS-induced mice  model was established by giving mice drinking water containing 5% (w/v) DSS for 7 days. Alpinetin (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) were administered once a day by intraperitoneal injection 3 days before DSS treatment. In vitro, phorbol myristate  (PMA)-differentiated monocytic THP-1 macrophages were treated with alpinetin and stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The results showed that alpinetin significantly attenuated diarrhea, colonic shortening, histological injury, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and the expressions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL-1β) production in mice. In vitro, alpinetin markedly inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-1β production, as well as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mediated nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation.

IP-10 has been reported to mediate chronic inflammation such as that in  (IBD). However, the local secretion of IP-10 in the intestine remains unclear. In this study, we investigated IP-10 secretion in human colonic subepithelial myofibroblasts (SEMFs).IP-10 secretion was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and IP-10 mRNA expression was evaluated by Northern blotting.Interleukin (IL)-10 mRNA was not detected in unstimulated SEMFs. Interferon (IFN)-gamma strongly induced IP-10 mRNA expression. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha also stimulated IP-10 mRNA expression, but this was much weaker than that induced by IFN-gamma. The effects of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were detected in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These responses were also observed at the protein levels. The IFN-gamma-induced IP-10 secretion was not affected by  or propionate, but was significantly reduced by butyrate. Trichostatin A, a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase, also blocked the IFN-gamma- and TNF-alpha-induced IP-10 mRNA expression, but the effects of trichostatin A were weaker than those of butyrate. The inhibitory effect of butyrate on IFN-gamma-induced IP-10 release was not associated with STAT (signaling transducer and activator of transcription)-1alpha activation.We demonstrated that human colonic SEMFs are the local site for the secretion IP-10. The regulation of IP-10 release by IFN-gamma and butyrate may play an important role in controlling chronic mucosal inflammation in pathological entities such as IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29360535>Microbial biotransformation of bioactive and clinically useful steroids and some salient features of steroids and biotransformation.</a></h2><p>Steroids are perhaps one of the most widely used group of drugs in present day. Beside the established utilization as immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, anti-rheumatic, progestational, diuretic, sedative, anabolic and contraceptive agents, recent applications of steroid compounds include the treatment of some forms of cancer, osteoporosis, HIV infections and treatment of declared AIDS. Steroids isolated are often available in minute amounts. So biotransformation of natural products provides a powerful means in solving supply problems in clinical trials and marketing of the drug for obtaining natural products in bulk amounts. If the structure is complex, it is often an impossible task to isolate enough of the natural products for clinical trials. The microbial biotransformation of steroids yielded several novel metabolites, exhibiting different activities. The metabolites produced from pregnenolone  by Cunning hamella elegans and Rhizopus stolonifer were screened against tyrosinase and cholinesterase showed significant inhibitory activities than the parent compound. Diosgenin and its transformed sarsasapogenin were screened for their acetyl cholinesterase and butyryl cholinesterase inhibitory activities. Sarsasapogenin was screened for phytotoxicity, and was found to be more active than the parent compound. Diosgenin, prednisone and their derivatives were screened for their anti-leishmanial activity. All derivatives were found to be more active than the parent compound. The biotransformation of steroids have been reviewed to a little extent. This review focuses on the biotransformation and functions of selected steroids, the classification, advantages and agents of enzymatic biotransformation and examines the potential role of new enzymatically transformed steroids and their derivatives in the chemoprevention and treatment of other diseases. tyrosinase and cholinesterase inhibitory activities, severe asthma, rheumatic disorders, renal disorders and diseases of inflammatory bowel, skin, gastrointestinal tract.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The increase in intestinal permeability allows the translocation of luminal antigens across the intestinal epithelium, leading to the exacerbation of . Thus, therapies targeted at specifically restoring tight junction barrier function are thought to have great potential as an alternative or supplement to immunology-based therapies. In this study, we screened Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, and Lactobacillus species for beneficial microbes to strengthen the intestinal epithelial barrier, using the human intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco-2) in an in vitro assay. Some Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species prevented epithelial barrier disruption induced by TNF-α, as assessed by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Furthermore, live Bifidobacterium species promoted wound repair in Caco-2 cell monolayers treated with TNF-α for 48 h.

The liquid chromatography system consisted of a C(18) column with an ammonium -formic acid-acetonitrile buffer. 8-Bromoadenine was the internal standard. Analytes were measured with positive ionization and multiple reaction monitoring mode. With PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and TaqMan allelic discrimination, common TPMT alleles (*1, *2, *3A, *3B, *3C) were determined in 31 792 individuals. We used perchloric acid extraction, acid hydrolysis, and HPLC with ultraviolet detection to measure erythrocyte 6-TG and 6-MMP nucleotide concentrations in 6189 patients with  receiving azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine therapy.Intra- and interday imprecision were <10% at low and high analyte concentrations. The conversion of 6-TG and 6-MMP nucleoside mono-, di-, and triphosphates was complete after hydrolysis. Allelic frequency for TPMT variant alleles ranged from 0.0063% (*3B) to 3.61% (*3A). Compared with wild types, TPMT heterozygotes had an 8.3-fold higher risk for 6-TGNs >450 pmol/8 x 10(8) erythrocytes (concentration associated with increased risk for leukopenia), but an 8.2-fold lower risk for 6-MMPNs >5700 pmol/8 x 10(8) erythrocytes (concentration associated with increased risk for hepatotoxicity).The liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method can be applied to the routine monitoring of thiopurine therapy.

This study designed coatless delayed-release oral colon-specific alginate pellets for ulcerative  treatment. Alginate pellets, formulated with water-insoluble ethylcellulose and various calcium salts, were prepared using solvent-free melt pelletization technique which prevented reaction between processing materials during agglomeration and allowed reaction to initiate only in dissolution. Combination of acid-soluble calcium carbonate and highly water-soluble calcium  did not impart colon-specific characteristics to pellets due to pore formation in fragmented matrices. Combination of moderately water-soluble calcium phosphate and calcium  delayed drug release due to rapid alginate crosslinking by soluble calcium from  salt followed by sustaining alginate crosslinking by calcium phosphate. The use of 1:3 ethylcellulose-to-alginate enhanced the sustained drug release attribute. The ethylcellulose was able to maintain the pellet integrity without calcium . Using hydrophobic prednisolone as therapeutic, hydrophilic alginate pellets formulated with hydrophobic ethylcellulose and moderately polar calcium phosphate exhibited colon-specific in vitro drug release and in vivo anti-inflammatory action.

Thus, IL-10- and M-CSF-rich conditions in colonic tissues seem to contribute to the improvement of pathological conditions in patients with  (IBD). We have already reported that ulinastatin, a serine protease inhibitor, increases M-CSF production during granulocyte/monocyte (GM) adsorption to cellulose  (CA) beads (carriers for Adacolumn therapy). However, the effects of ulinastatin on IL-10 production have not been clarified. The aim of the present study was to clarify the effects of ulinastatin on IL-10 production during GM adsorption by in vitro experiments. Peripheral blood was divided into four groups: (Control) no ulinastatin added, no contact with CA beads; (1) no ulinastatin added, contact with CA beads; (2) ulinastatin added, no contact with CA beads; and (3) ulinastatin added, contact with CA beads. After incubation, IL-10 in the plasma was measured. Compared with the level in the Control group, plasma IL-10 was significantly higher only in group 3, in which ulinastatin was added in the presence of CA beads, but did not increase in the absence of CA beads. These results suggest that ulinastatin synergistically increases IL-10 production with monocyte adsorption stimuli. By increasing not only M-CSF but also IL-10, a combination of ulinastatin and Adacolumn therapy may improve clinical efficacy for the treatment of IBD in terms of the induction of anti- intestinal macrophages.© 2012 The Authors.

Several years ago, Human Microbiome Project (HMP) researchers generated a list of "most wanted" taxa: bacteria both prevalent among healthy volunteers and distantly related to any sequenced organisms. Unfortunately, the challenge of assembling high-quality genomes from a tangle of metagenomic reads has slowed progress in learning about these uncultured bacteria. Here, we describe how recent advances in sequencing and analysis allowed us to assemble "most wanted" genomes from metagenomic data collected from four stool samples. Using a combination of both de novo and guided assembly methods, we assembled and binned over 100 genomes from an initial data set of over 1,300 Gbp. One of these genome bins, which met HMP's criteria for a "most wanted" taxa, contained three essentially complete genomes belonging to a previously uncultivated species. This species is most closely related to Eubacterium desmolans and the clostridial cluster IV/Clostridium leptum subgroup species Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum (71-76% average nucleotide identity). Gene function analysis indicates that the species is an obligate anaerobe, forms spores, and produces the anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids  and butyrate. It also appears to take up metabolically costly molecules such as cobalamin, methionine, and branch-chained amino acids from the environment, and to lack virulence genes. Thus, the evidence is consistent with a secondary degrader that occupies a host-dependent, nutrient-scavenging niche within the gut; its ability to produce butyrate, which is thought to play an anti-inflammatory role, makes it intriguing for the study of diseases such as colon cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. In conclusion, we have assembled essentially complete genomes from stool metagenomic data, yielding valuable information about uncultured organisms' metabolic and ecologic niches, factors that may be required to successfully culture these bacteria, and their role in maintaining health and causing disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18679064>Comparison of the efficacy of granulocyte and monocyte/macrophage adsorptive apheresis and leukocytapheresis in active ulcerative colitis patients: a prospective randomized study.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic  associated with recurring inflammation of the colorectal mucosa. Recently, cytapheresis has emerged as a new treatment for patients with UC. Removal methods are mainly performed with beads [granulocyte and monocyte/macrophage adsorptive apheresis (GMCAP)] or filters [leukocytapheresis (LCAP)]. Both treatments have been reported to be effective for active UC. There have been few trials, however, comparing the efficacy of GMCAP and LCAP. In this study, we prospectively evaluated the efficacy of LCAP and GMCAP for the treatment of active UC.Thirty-nine patients [18 male, 21 female; mean age 38.7 years; duration of  6 years; clinical activity index (CAI) >6 points] with moderate-to-severe active UC were randomly assigned to the LCAP (n=21) or GMCAP group (n=17). Adacolumn (cellulose  beads; Japan Immunoresearch Laboratories, Takasaki, Japan) for GMCAP and Cellsorba EX (polyethylene phthalate fibers; Asahi Medical Co.

Steroid doses were tapered if patients achieved clinical improvement. When the CAI score had decreased by 5 points or more, the patient was considered to have improved.Thirteen patients in the GMCAP group and 14 in the LCAP group achieved clinical improvement. No significant difference was found in clinical response and clinical course between LCAP and GMCAP. Hemoglobin levels were significantly decreased immediately after one session of cytapheresis in the LCAP group. No severe adverse effects were observed in any of the patients. No significant differences were observed in any clinical parameters predictive of a response to either LCAP or GMCAP. But in all patients receiving cytapheresis, a high CAI score was a significant risk factor for treatment failure.

DSS-induced , including body weight loss, reduced colon length, and histological colon injury, was significantly ameliorated in mice fed the P. oleracea extracts (200 and 500mg/kg). In particular, P. oleracea extracts also inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, and 1L-1β) production in mice with DSS-induced ; the P. oleracea extracts displayed higher and/or similar inhibitory activity to sulfasalazine at high concentrations. Furthermore, the chemical structures of active compounds separated from the EtOAc extract of P. oleracea were elucidated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (see Figure in supplementary materials), resulting in the identification of three known compounds. Among these active compounds, cis-N-feruloyl-3'-methoxytyramine (2) exhibited the strongest effects on preventing DSS-induced IBD in animal models.

In contrast to GA, which was more effective when administered daily by injection of 2.0 mg/mouse, TV-5010 was most effective when administered once a week, at dose of 0.2-1.0 mg/mouse. TV-5010 treatment abrogated the characteristic inflammation in the diseased organ as demonstrated by reduction in the colonic mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and the Th1 transcription factor T-bet, as well as by augmentation of the regulatory cytokine TGF-beta. Injection of naive mice with TV-5010 generated lymphocyte population of the Th2/3 subtype that effectively reduced  manifestations upon adoptive transfer to mice with DSS-colitis. Moreover, TV-5010-specific T-cells, either exogenously labeled or genetically marked, adoptively transferred to colitis-induced mice, localized in the inner layers of the injured colon and expressed TGF-beta in situ. Thus, TV-5010 is effective in the suppression of experimental colitis similarly to GA, with the advantage of less frequent administration, possibly via immunomodulation at the site of pathological damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15371592>Mechanism of action of glatiramer  in multiple sclerosis and its potential for the development of new applications.</a></h2><p>Glatiramer  (GA, Copaxone, Copolymer 1) is an approved drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and is highly effective in the suppression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in various species. The mode of action of GA is by initial strong promiscuous binding to MHC molecules and consequent competition with various myelin antigens for their presentation to T cells. A further aspect of its action is potent induction of specific suppressor cells of the T helper 2 (Th2) type that migrate to the brain and lead to in situ bystander suppression. Furthermore, the GA-specific cells in the brain express the antiinflammatory cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta, in addition to brain-derived neurotrophic factor, whereas they do not express IFN-gamma. Based on this immunomodulatory mode of action, we explored the potential of GA for two other applications: prevention of graft rejection and amelioration of . GA was effective in amelioration of graft rejection in two systems by prolongation of skin graft survival and inhibition of functional deterioration of thyroid grafts, across minor and major histocompatibility barriers. In all transplantation systems GA treatment inhibited the detrimental secretion of Th1  cytokines and induced beneficial Th2/3 antiinflammatory response. GA was effective also in combination with low-dose immunosuppressive drugs.  are characterized by detrimental imbalanced proinflammatory immune reactivity in the gut. GA significantly suppressed the various manifestations of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis, including mortality, weight loss, and macroscopic and microscopic colonic damage. GA suppressed local lymphocyte proliferations and tumor necrosis factor alpha detrimental secretion but induced transforming growth factor beta, thus confirming the involvement of Th1 to Th2 shift in GA mode of action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25882947>[Effect of inherent depression on chronic visceral hypersensitivity induced by colon  stimulation in neonatal rats].</a></h2><p>To explore the effect of inherent depression on chronic visceral hypersensitivity.

The visceral sensitivity was measured by colorectal distension (CRD). The expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), mast cell (MC), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in colon and IDO in specific cerebral regions were detected through immunohistochemistry.Abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores showed that visceral sensitivity of -enema groups was significantly higher than that of saline-enema groups (FH/Wjd:2.44 ± 0.04 vs.1.96 ± 0.07, P < 0.05; SD: 1.75 ± 0.13 vs.1.32 ± 0.05, P < 0.05). Furthermore, FH/Wjd rats of IBS group scored significantly higher than SD rats of IBS group (2.44 ± 0.04 vs.1.75 ± 0.13, P < 0.05). The MC amounts of both SD and FH/Wjd IBS group rats were significantly more than those of their control groups (FH/Wjd:43.24 ± 1.72 vs. 24.92 ± 1.38, P < 0.01. SD: 23.80 ± 1.28 vs. 14.24 ± 0.92, P < 0.01). Besides, the MC amounts of control and IBS group of FH/Wjd rats were significantly more than that of SD IBS group rats (P < 0.01). The IDO and 5-HT positive cells in colonic mucosa of IBS group of both SD and FH/Wjd rats were significantly more than those of their control groups, respectively(P < 0.01). The IDO, 5-HT positive cells in colonic mucosa of both control and IBS group of FH/Wjd rats were significantly more than those of both control and IBS group of SD rats (control:IDO,24.64 ± 2.22 vs. 15.52 ± 1.39;5-HT,21.32 ± 1.26 vs. 12.72 ± 1.12.

The expression of IDO in prelimbic cortex (PrL) areas of FH/Wjd IBS rats was significantly higher than that of IBS group of SD rats (49.60 ± 4.31 vs. 35.60 ± 2.42, P <0.01), and the expression of IDO in rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) areas of FH/Wjd IBS rats was significantly more than that of FH/Wjd control rats (45.44 ± 1.16 vs. 34.08 ± 2.76, P <0.01).Inherent depressive FH/Wjd rats were more sensitive to neonatal colon  stimulation, presenting as visceral hypersensitivity which maybe associated with increased MC amounts and over-expression of 5-HT and IDO in colon, suggesting that depression disorder may aggravate functional disturbance of gastrointestinal tract by regulating the response to inflammatory stimulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20936355>The neutrophil respiratory burst and bacterial digestion in Crohn's .</a></h2><p>Neutrophils are a key part of the innate immune defence against microbes, using the respiratory burst (RB) to optimise killing and digestion. Previous studies of the neutrophil RB in Crohn's  (CD) have yielded conflicting results.Superoxide production in response to phorbol-myristyl  (PMA) was measured in neutrophils from 100 patients with CD compared to 50 healthy controls (HCs) and 50 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). A further 22 CD and 10 HCs were studied using f-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), and digestion of E. coli by neutrophils was also evaluated.The mean ± SEM PMA-stimulated RB (nmol O(2)/10(6) cells/min) was 10.86 ± 0.26 in HCs, 9.76 ± 0.23 in CD (P=0.02) and 10.04 ± 0.28 in UC (P=0.09 vs HC and 0.47 vs CD). No significant effect of age, gender or medication was observed. The RB in three patients with presumed CD was found to be in the range expected in patients with inherited neutrophil disorders. Stimulation with fMLP was calcium dependent and attenuated in patients on 5-ASA. Digestion of E. coli by neutrophils was not different in HC vs CD (21.6 vs 20.53%, P=0.60).The significant reduction in neutrophil RB in CD does not appear to result in defective bacterial digestion and is therefore unlikely play a major role in pathogenesis. Three patients in this cohort of patients with presumed idiopathic CD were found to have a profound defect of the neutrophil RB. A high index of suspicion for such patients is prudent, as their prognosis can be improved by altering or augmenting the conventional treatment regimens employed for CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601826>Bumadizone calcium dihydrate microspheres compressed tablets for colon targeting: formulation, optimization and in vivo evaluation in rabbits.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was the development of a colon-targeted microspheres which were compressed into tablets containing the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory bumadizone calcium hemihydrate. [corrected]. A 3(2) full factorial design was adopted for the evaluation of the prepared microspheres. The effect of two independent variables namely polymer type (Eudragit RS100, ethyl cellulose and cellulose  butyrate), and drug: polymer ratio (1:1, 9:1 and 18:1) was studied on the entrapment efficiency and in vitro drug release for 12 h. Colon targeting aims to minimize the release of the drug off target area (pH 1.2 and 6.8) and to maximize the release of the drug in target area (pH 7.4). Candidate formulae were compressed into core tablets and colon targeting was achieved using the enzyme-dependent polymer (pectin) as coat in three different concentrations 50, 75 and 90%. Candidate formula F15 (microspheres prepared using BDZ:CAB in a ratio of 18:1 and compressed into tablets using 50% pectin and 50% Avicel in the coat) was able to adequately modulate drug release avoiding drug release in the gastric ambient, and reaching the colonic targeting where 99.7% release was achieved within 12 h following zero-order model. In vivo studies showed that F15 achieved significant decrease in myeloperoxidase activity and inflammation with delayed Tmax (4 h) and lower Cmax (2700 ng/ml) when compared to marketed product.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15185858>Selective granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis as a first-line treatment for steroid naïve patients with active ulcerative colitis: a prospective uncontrolled study.</a></h2><p>Corticosteroid therapy of ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with frequent adverse side effects and poor quality of life. Recently, adsorptive granulocyte and monocyte/macrophage apheresis has shown efficacy in patients with severe steroid refractory UC. The objective of this study was to investigate if, instead of corticosteroids, adsorptive leukocytapheresis has efficacy as the first-line therapy for steroid-naïve patients with active UC. Twenty patients, aged 15-49 years, with a mean clinical activity index (CAI) of 8.6 were recruited. Adsorptive leukocytapheresis was done with Adacolumn, which contains cellulose  beads as adsorptive carriers for granulocytes and monocytes (FcgammaR and complement receptors expressing leukocytes). Each patient received 6 to 10 leukocytapheresis sessions of 60-min duration, at 2 sessions/week. Efficacy was assessed 1 week after the last session. Post treatment, the mean CAI was 3.0 (P = 0001), and 17 of 20 patients (85%) were in remission. There were significant falls in C-reactive protein (P = 0.0003), total white cell counts (P = 0.003), neutrophils (P = 0.0029), and monocytes (P = 0.0038), an increase in lymphocytes (P = 0.001), and increases in the blood levels of soluble TNF-alpha receptors I (P = 0.0007) and II (P = 0.0045) in the column outflow (blood return to the patients). Further, at 8 months, 60% of patients had maintained their remission. No severe side effects were reported. In conclusion, adsorptive leukocytapheresis should reduce corticosteroid therapy in patients with moderate UC; cases with early-stage active  may benefit most.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27346602>The neuropharmacology of butyrate: The bread and butter of the microbiota-gut-brain axis?</a></h2><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that brain function and behaviour are influenced by microbial metabolites. Key products of the microbiota are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including butyric acid. Butyrate is a functionally versatile molecule that is produced in the mammalian gut by fermentation of dietary fibre and is enriched in butter and other dairy products. Butyrate along with other fermentation-derived SCFAs (e.g. , propionate) and the structurally related ketone bodies (e.g. acetoacetate and d-β-hydroxybutyrate) show promising effects in various  including obesity, diabetes,  () , and colorectal cancer as well as neurological disorders. Indeed, it is clear that host energy metabolism and immune functions critically depend on butyrate as a potent regulator, highlighting butyrate as a key mediator of host-microbe crosstalk. In addition to specific receptors (GPR43/FFAR2; GPR41/FFAR3; GPR109a/HCAR2) and transporters (MCT1/SLC16A1; SMCT1/SLC5A8), its effects are mediated by utilisation as an energy source via the β-oxidation pathway and as an inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs), promoting histone acetylation and stimulation of gene expression in host cells. The latter has also led to the use of butyrate as an experimental drug in models for neurological disorders ranging from depression to neurodegenerative  and cognitive impairment. Here we provide a critical review of the literature on butyrate and its effects on multiple aspects of host physiology with a focus on brain function and behaviour. We find fundamental differences in natural butyrate at physiological concentrations and its use as a neuropharmacological agent at rather high, supraphysiological doses in brain research. Finally, we hypothesise that butyrate and other volatile SCFAs produced by microbes may be involved in regulating the impact of the microbiome on behaviour including social communication.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The amino acid copolymer glatiramer  (GA, Copaxone) is an approved first-line treatment for MS that has a unique mode of action. Accumulated evidence from EAE-induced animals and from MS patients indicates that GA affects various levels of the innate and the adaptive immune response, generating deviation from the pro- to the anti- pathway. This review aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the diverse mechanism of action of GA in EAE/MS, in particular on the in situ immunomodulatory effect of GA and its ability to generate neuroprotective repair consequences in the CNS.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that a physical interaction between transcription factor FOXP3 and the epigenetic enzyme enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is essential for gene co-repressive function.Human FOXP3 mutations clinically relevant to intestinal inflammation were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. T lymphocytes were isolated from mice, human blood, and lamina propria of Crohn's disease (CD) patients and non-CD controls. We performed proximity ligation or a co-immunoprecipitation assay in FOXP3-mutant, interleukin 6 (IL6)-treated or CD-CD4 T cells to assess FOXP3-EZH2 protein interaction. We studied  promoter activity and chromatin state of the interferon γ locus via luciferase reporter and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays, respectively, in cells expressing FOXP3 mutants.EZH2 binding was abrogated by inflammatory bowel disease-associated FOXP3 cysteine 232 (C232) mutation. The C232 mutant showed impaired repression of  and diminished EZH2-mediated trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 on interferon γ, indicative of compromised Treg physiologic function. Generalizing this mechanism, IL6 impaired FOXP3-EZH2 interaction. IL6-induced effects were reversed by Janus kinase 1/2 inhibition. In lamina propria-derived CD4T cells from CD patients, we observed decreased FOXP3-EZH2 interaction.FOXP3-C232 mutation disrupts EZH2 recruitment and gene co-repressive function. The proinflammatory cytokine IL6 abrogates FOXP3-EZH2 interaction. Studies in lesion-derived CD4 T cells have shown that reduced FOXP3-EZH2 interaction is a molecular feature of CD patients. Destabilized FOXP3-EZH2 protein interaction via diverse mechanisms and consequent Treg abnormality may drive gastrointestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25368192>Sex disparity in colonic adenomagenesis involves promotion by male hormones, not protection by female hormones.</a></h2><p>It recently has been recognized that men develop colonic adenomas and carcinomas at an earlier age and at a higher rate than women. In the Apc(Pirc/+) (Pirc) rat model of early colonic cancer, this sex susceptibility was recapitulated, with male Pirc rats developing twice as many adenomas as females. Analysis of large datasets revealed that the Apc(Min/+) mouse also shows enhanced male susceptibility to adenomagenesis, but only in the colon. In addition, WT mice treated with injections of the carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) showed increased numbers of colonic adenomas in males. The mechanism underlying these observations was investigated by manipulation of hormonal status. The preponderance of colonic adenomas in the Pirc rat model allowed a statistically significant investigation in vivo of the mechanism of sex hormone action on the development of colonic adenomas. Females depleted of endogenous hormones by ovariectomy did not exhibit a change in prevalence of adenomas, nor was any effect observed with replacement of one or a combination of female hormones. In contrast, depletion of male hormones by orchidectomy (castration) markedly protected the Pirc rat from adenoma development, whereas supplementation with testosterone reversed that effect. These observations were recapitulated in the AOM mouse model. Androgen receptor was undetectable in the colon or adenomas, making it likely that testosterone acts indirectly on the tumor lineage. Our findings suggest that indirect tumor-promoting effects of testosterone likely explain the disparity between the sexes in the development of colonic adenomas.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26373169>Kinetic Properties of Pyruvate Ferredoxin Oxidoreductase of Intestinal Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria Desulfovibrio piger Vib-7 and Desulfomicrobium sp.

The bacteria consume lactate as electron donor which is oxidized to  via pyruvate in process of the dissimilatory sulfate reduction. Pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity and the kinetic properties of the enzyme from intestinal sulfate-reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio piger and Desulfomicrobium sp. have never been well-characterized and have not been yet studied. In this paper we present for the first time the specific activity of pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase and the kinetic properties of the enzyme in cell-free extracts of both D. piger Vib-7 and Desulfomicrobium sp. Rod-9 intestinal bacterial strains. Microbiological, biochemical, biophysical and statistical methods were used in this work. The optimal temperature (+35°C) and pH 8.5 for enzyme reaction were determined. The spectral analysis of the puri- fied pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase from the cell-free extracts was demonstrated. Analysis of the kinetic properties of the studied enzyme was carried out. Initial (instantaneous) reaction velocity (V0), maximum amount of the product of reaction (Pmax), the reaction time (half saturation period) and maximum velocity of the pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase reaction (V ) were defined. Michaelis constants (Km) of the enzyme reaction were calculated for both intestinal bacterial strains.

Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is involved in the pathogenesis of MS. Paradoxically, administration of anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies to IBD patients has led to exacerbation of MS or triggered demyelination. TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) mediates demyelination and TNFR2 mediates remyelination, suggesting that a more selective approach to TNF antagonism may be required for an anti-TNF strategy to be effective in MS. Conversely, interferon treatment for MS may worsen IBD. Anti-lymphocyte trafficking strategies such as alpha4 integrin blockers are effective in both these . Recent advances in small molecule development in this area may provide further effective therapies. Common  cytokine and signaling pathways may be shared between MS and IBD, such as TNF, interleukin (IL)-12/23, IL-17, CD40 and STAT3. However, in contrast to Crohn's , ustekinumab has not shown efficacy in MS. Vitamin D deficiency is a hot topic in both . Several drugs developed for MS, e.g. glatiramer , are also being studied in IBDs.

Its treatment effect has been expanded to other autoimmune conditions such as uveoretinitis, , graft rejection and hepatic fibrosis. Here, we report that GA was effective in altering the clinical course of diabetes in cyclophosphamide (CY)-potentiated non-obese diabetic (CY-NOD) mice. Treatment with GA significantly reduced the diabetic rate in the mice and ameliorated insulitis, which coincided with increased CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cell response in treated mice. GA treatment led to increased expression of transcription factor Foxp3 and elevated production of interleukin-4 (IL-4) both in vivo and in vitro. It was evident that the effect of GA on up-regulation of Foxp3 was mediated partially through IL-4. IL-4 was found to maintain Foxp3 expression and regulatory function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). This study provides new evidence that GA has treatment potential for type 1 diabetes through the induction of Tregs and that increased IL-4 production is partially responsible for the enhanced Treg's function in GA treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22401910>Larazotide  promotes tight junction assembly in epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Tight junctions (TJ) control paracellular permeability and apical-basolateral polarity of epithelial cells. Dysregulated permeability is associated with pathological conditions, such as celiac  and . TJ formation is dependent on E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and actin rearrangement, and is regulated by the Rho family GTPase and aPKC signaling pathways. Larazotide , an 8-mer peptide and TJ modulator, inhibits TJ disassembly and dysfunction caused by endogenous and exogenous stimuli in intestinal epithelial cells. Here, we examined the effect of larazotide  on de novo TJ assembly using 2 different model systems. In MDCK cells, larazotide  promoted TJ assembly in a calcium switch assay. Larazotide  also promoted actin rearrangement, and junctional distribution of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin, claudins, and E-cadherin. Larazotide  promoted TJ maturation and decreased paracellular permeability in "leaky" Caco-2 cells.

Although the surface-attached, mucosal microbiota has a unique composition and potential to influence human health, it remains difficult to study in vivo. Therefore, we performed an in-depth microbial characterization (human intestinal tract chip (HITChip)) of a recently developed dynamic in vitro gut model, which simulates both luminal and mucosal gut microbes (mucosal-simulator of human intestinal microbial ecosystem (M-SHIME)). Inter-individual differences among human subjects were confirmed and microbial patterns unique for each individual were preserved in vitro. Furthermore, in correspondence with in vivo studies, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were enriched in the luminal content while Firmicutes rather colonized the mucin layer, with Clostridium cluster XIVa accounting for almost 60% of the mucin-adhered microbiota. Of the many  and/or lactate-converting butyrate producers within this cluster, Roseburia intestinalis and Eubacterium rectale most specifically colonized mucins.

Correspondingly, the simulated mucosal environment induced a shift from  towards butyrate. As not only inter-individual differences were preserved but also because compared with conventional models, washout of relevant mucin-adhered microbes was avoided, simulating the mucosal gut microbiota represents a breakthrough in modeling and mechanistically studying the human intestinal microbiome in health and .

The removal of activated leukocytes and several additional immunomodulatory mechanisms have been so far suggested to explain the anti-inflammatory effects of the treatment. Recent data indicate that, during centrifugation based apheresis, sHLA-I adsorbed to plastic circuits is able to induce TGFβ production in activated leukocytes. On these bases, the present study was aimed at analyzing if this model could be applied to a noncentrifugation based apheresis, such as granulocyte and monocyte apheresis. Ten patients with ulcerative  were enrolled. Every patient received 5 weekly apheresis treatments. Cellulose  beads removed from the column post-GMA were stained by fluorescent anticlass I mAb and examined by fluorescent microscope. Moreover, sFasL plasma concentration, TGFβ plasma levels, and the percentage of TGFβ positive neutrophils were evaluated before and immediately after each single apheresis. Immunofluorescent images revealed a homogeneous layer of a sHLA-I adsorbed to the surface of the beads recovered following the procedure. sFasL plasma concentration progressively increased both following the procedures and during inter-procedure periods. Consistently, also TGFβ plasma levels and the percentage of TGFβ positive neutrophils increased during the procedures with a meaningful relationship with sFasL plasma levels. Taken together, these findings suggest that the immunosuppressive effects attributed to granulocyte and monocyte apheresis might depend, at least in part, on the sensitivity of activated leucocytes to the bioactivity of sHLA-I molecules.

This study sought to determine predictors of response to this new nonpharmacologic mode of therapy by retrospectively evaluating 28 patients who received granulocytapheresis after experiencing active ulcerative colitis (UC). Between April 2000 and March 2004, 28 consecutive patients received granulocytapheresis for active UC with the Adacolumn, which is filled with cellulose  beads as the column leukocytapheresis carriers; the carriers adsorb granulocytes, monocytes/macrophages, and a small fraction of lymphocytes (FcgammaR and complement receptors bearing leukocytes). Each patient could receive up to 10 Adacolumn sessions, at 2 sessions per week. In 2004, clinical response was retrospectively evaluated. Seven days after the last Adacolumn session, 20 of 28 patients had remission (colitis activity index [CAI] < or =4) including all 8 patients who had their first UC episode. The mean duration of UC in the 8 first episode cases was 3.4 months compared with 40.2 months for all 28 patients and 65.4 months for the 8 nonresponders.

Gastrointestinal epithelia seem to use butyrate and butyrate-induced endocrine signals to adapt proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation to the growth of the bacterial community. Butyrate has a potential clinical application in the treatment of  (IBD; ulcerative colitis). Via inhibited release of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 13 and inhibition of histone deacetylase, butyrate may contribute to the restoration of the tight junction barrier in IBD by affecting the expression of claudin-2, occludin, cingulin, and zonula occludens poteins (ZO-1, ZO-2). Further evaluation of the molecular events that link butyrate to an improved tight junction structure will allow for the elucidation of the cofactors affecting the reliability of butyrate as a clinical treatment tool.© 2012 New York Academy of Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24707303>Metabolomics approach to serum biomarker for loperamide-induced constipation in SD rats.</a></h2><p>Loperamide has long been known as an opioid-receptor agonist useful as a drug for treatment of diarrhea resulting from gastroenteritis or  as well as to induce constipation. To determine and characterize putative biomarkers that can predict constipation induced by loperamide treatment, alteration of endogenous metabolites was measured in the serum of Sprague Dawley (SD) rats treated with loperamide for 3 days using (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR) spectral data. The amounts and weights of stool and urine excretion were significantly lower in the loperamide-treated group than the No-treated group, while the thickness of the villus, crypt layer, and muscle layer was decreased in the transverse colon of the same group. The concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatinine (Cr) were also slightly changed in the loperamide-treated group, although most of the serum components were maintained at a constant level. Furthermore, pattern recognition of endogenous metabolites showed completely separate clustering of the serum analysis parameters between the No-treated group and loperamide-treated group. Among 35 endogenous metabolites, four amino acids (alanine, glutamate, glutamine and glycine) and six endogenous metabolites (, glucose, glycerol, lactate, succinate and taurine) were dramatically decreased in loperamide-treated SD rats. These results provide the first data pertaining to metabolic changes in SD rats with loperamide-induced constipation. Additionally, these findings correlate the changes in 10 metabolites with constipation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17577060>Antimicrobial activity of lacticin 3,147 against clinical Clostridium difficile strains.</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) is the most common hospital-acquired diarrhoea, and is a major type of gastroenteritis infection in nursing homes and facilities for the elderly. In this study the antimicrobial activity of the two-component lantibiotic, lacticin 3,147, against a range of genetically distinct C. difficile isolates was studied. The bacteriocin exhibited an MIC(50) of 3.6 microg ml(-1) for 10 genetically distinct C. difficile strains isolated from healthy subjects,  patients and culture collection strains. In time-kill studies, 10(6) c.f.u. ml(-1) C. difficile ATCC 42,593 and CDAD isolate DPC 6,220 were killed within 120 or 20 min incubation, respectively, at a concentration of 6 microg lacticin ml(-1). Interestingly, addition of lacticin 3,147 to exponentially growing cells of C. difficile ATCC 43,593 caused rapid lysis of the cells after an initial lag phase, as measured by the concomitant release of the intracellular enzyme,  kinase. The addition of a food-grade, milk-based lacticin containing powder to faecal fermentation demonstrated that lacticin is effective in completely eliminating 10(6) c.f.u. C. difficile ml(-1) from a model faecal environment within 30 min when present at concentrations as low as 18 microg ml(-1). While other culturable microflora such as total anaerobes, bacteroides, total non-spore-forming anaerobes and total Gram-negative anaerobes were unaffected, populations of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were reduced by 3 log cycles at bacteriocin levels sufficient to eliminate over 10(6) C. difficile. In light of these findings, the potential of lacticin 3,147 for treatment of CDAD is discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16624971>Immunomodulatory therapeutic effect of glatiramer  on several murine models of .</a></h2><p> (IBD) is characterized by detrimental immune reactivity in the gut and imbalance between proinflammatory and anti- reactivity. In an attempt to down-regulate colitis, we investigated the effect of the immunomodulator glatiramer  (GA, Copaxone, copolymer 1) on two murine models of IBD, chemically induced and spontaneous. Acute experimental colitis of different levels of severity was induced in C57BL/6 mice by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) administered orally at different concentrations and frequencies. It was manifested in weight loss, intestinal bleeding, and diarrhea, as well as by macroscopic and microscopic colon damage. GA treatment led to amelioration of all of these pathological manifestations, resulting in improved long-term survival. Moreover, even when colitis was induced by three cycles of DSS in this highly susceptible mouse strain, as well as in BALB/c mice that exhibit a chronic  pattern, a substantial reduction in  activity and mortality was obtained. GA treatment induced a beneficial effect also in a spontaneous model of colitis developed in the C3H/HeJBir IL-10-deficient mice. The detrimental proinflammatory response manifested by proliferation, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma expression was modulated by GA, whereas the regulatory anti- transforming growth factor-beta and IL-10 cytokines response was elevated. This was demonstrated on the level of protein secretion in splenocytes and local mesenteric lymphocytes in response to syngeneic colon extract and in the overall response to anti-CD3, as well as on the level of mRNA expression in the colon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26562762>A deterministic oscillatory model of microtubule growth and shrinkage for differential actions of short chain fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Short chain fatty acids (SCFA), principally , propionate, butyrate and valerate, are produced in pharmacologically relevant concentrations by the gut microbiome. Investigations indicate that they exert beneficial effects on colon epithelia. There is increasing interest in whether different SCFAs have distinct functions which may be exploited for prevention or treatment of colonic  including colorectal cancer (CRC),  and obesity. Based on experimental evidence, we hypothesised that odd-chain SCFAs may possess anti-mitotic capabilities in colon cancer cells by disrupting microtubule (MT) structural integrity via dysregulation of β-tubulin isotypes. MT dynamic instability is an essential characteristic of MT cellular activity. We report a minimal deterministic model that takes a novel approach to explore the hypothesised pathway by triggering spontaneous oscillations to represent MT dynamic behaviour. The dynamicity parameters in silico were compared to those reported in vitro. Simulations of untreated and butyrate (even-chain length) treated cells reflected MT behaviour in interphase or untreated control cells. The propionate and valerate (odd-chain length) simulations displayed increased catastrophe frequencies and longer periods of MT-fibre shrinkage. Their enhanced dynamicity was dissimilar to that observed in mitotic cells, but parallel to that induced by MT-destabilisation treatments. Antimicrotubule drugs act through upward or downward modulation of MT dynamic instability. Our computational modelling suggests that metabolic engineering of the microbiome may facilitate managing CRC risk by predicting outcomes of SCFA treatments in combination with AMDs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15973592>CBP-1011.

The management of chronic pelvic pain is challenging, as despite interventions involving surgery, many women remain in pain without a firm gynaecological diagnosis.To assess the effectiveness and safety of non-surgical interventions for women with chronic pelvic pain.We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register. We also searched (from inception to 5 February 2014) AMED, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS. We handsearched sources such as citation lists, trial registers and conference proceedings.Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on non-surgical management of chronic pelvic pain were eligible for inclusion. We included studies of women with a diagnosis of pelvic congestion syndrome or adhesions but excluded those with pain known to be caused by endometriosis, primary dysmenorrhoea (period pain), active chronic pelvic inflammatory disease or irritable bowel syndrome. We considered studies of any non-surgical intervention, including lifestyle, physical, medical and psychological treatments.Study selection, quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by two review authors. Meta-analysis was performed using the Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome measure was pain relief, and secondary outcome measures were psychological outcomes, quality of life, requirement for analgesia and adverse effects. The quality of the evidence was assessed by using GRADE methods.Twenty-one RCTs were identified that involved non-surgical management of chronic pelvic pain: 13 trials were included in the review, and eight were excluded. The studies included a total of 750 women-406 women in the intervention groups and 344 in the control groups. Included studies had high attrition rates, and investigators often did not blind adequately or did not clearly describe randomisation procedures. Medical treatment versus placebo Progestogen (medroxyprogesterone  (MPA)) was more effective than placebo at the end of treatment in terms of the number of women achieving a greater than 50% reduction in visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score immediately after treatment (Peto OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.70 to 5.31, two studies, n = 204, I(2) = 22%, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence of benefit was maintained up to nine months after treatment (Peto OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.71, two studies, n = 204, I(2) = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). Women treated with progestogen reported more adverse effects (e.g. weight gain, bloatedness) than those given placebo (high-quality evidence). The estimated effect of lofexidine on pain outcomes when compared with placebo was compatible with benefit and harm (Peto OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.61, one study, 39 women, low-quality evidence). Women in the lofexidine group reported more adverse effects (including drowsiness and dry mouth) than women given placebo (moderate-quality evidence). Head-to-head comparisons of medical treatments Head-to-head comparisons showed that women taking goserelin had greater improvement in pelvic pain score (MD 3, 95% CI 2.08 to 3.92, one study, n = 47, moderate-quality evidence) at one year than those taking progestogen. Women taking gabapentin had a lower VAS pain score than those taking amytriptyline (MD -1.50, 95% CI -2.06 to -0.94, n = 40, low-quality evidence). Study authors reported that no statistically significant difference was observed in the rate of adverse effects among women taking gabapentin compared with women given amytriptyline. The study comparing goserelin versus progestogen did not report on adverse effects. Psychological treatment Women who underwent reassurance ultrasound scans and received counselling were more likely to report improved pain than those treated with a standard 'wait and see' policy (Peto OR 6.77, 95% CI 2.83 to 16.19, n = 90, low-quality evidence). Significantly more women who had writing therapy as a disclosure reported improvement in pain than those in the non-disclosure group (Peto OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.41 to 14.13, n = 48, very low-quality evidence). No difference between groups in pain outcomes was noted when other psychological therapies were compared with standard care or placebo (quality of evidence ranged from very low to low). Studies did not report on adverse effects. Complementary therapy Distension of painful pelvic structures was more effective for pain when compared with counselling (MD 35.8, 95% CI 23.08 to 48.52 on a zero to 100 scale, one study, n = 48, moderate-quality evidence). No difference in pain levels was observed when magnetic therapy was compared with use of a control magnet (very low-quality evidence). Studies did not report on adverse effects.The results of studies examining psychological and complementary therapies could not be combined to yield meaningful results.Evidence of moderate quality supports progestogen as an option for chronic pelvic pain, with efficacy reported during treatment. In practice, this option may be most acceptable among women unconcerned about progestogenic adverse effects (e.g. weight gain, bloatedness-the most common adverse effects). Although some evidence suggests possible benefit of goserelin when compared with progestogen, gabapentin as compared with amytriptyline, ultrasound versus 'wait and see' and writing therapy versus non-disclosure, the quality of evidence is generally low, and evidence is drawn from single studies.Given the prevalence and healthcare costs associated with chronic pelvic pain in women, RCTs of other medical, lifestyle and psychological interventions are urgently required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29745046>Adsorption of Soluble Immunoglobulin-Type Adhesion Molecules to Cellulose  Beads.</a></h2><p>Circulating levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and vascular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) are elevated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Cellulose  (CA) beads are used as carriers for granulocyte and monocyte (GM) adsorptive apheresis (GMA). We investigated the effect of CA beads on sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 plasma concentrations in vitro. Because GM adsorption to CA beads increased with a rise in the incubation temperature in our previous study, peripheral blood was incubated with and without CA beads at 5, 25, 37, or 43 °C and plasma sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 was measured. The sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 concentrations in samples incubated with CA beads were significantly lower than those without CA beads at all four temperatures. However, no significant differences were observed both sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 plasma levels at the four different temperatures after incubation with CA beads. These results suggest that independent of incubation temperature, sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 are likely to adsorb CA beads.

Recent reports indicate that GA may also be effective in models of other autoimmune  such as uveoretinitis,  and graft rejection.

Fertility is normal in women with nonsurgically treated ulcerative  and similar or slightly reduced in women with Crohn's disease. Women who undergo ileal pouch anastomosis have reduced fertility. Fertility is likely worsened by disease activity but unaffected by medications used to treat IBD. Infertile patients with IBD respond as well as non-IBD patients to in vitro fertilization (IVF). Despite normal fertility, patients with IBD have fewer children due to concerns regarding infertility, disease inheritance, congenital abnormalities, and disease-related sexual dysfunction. Patients rarely discuss these issues with a physician. When discussion does occur, it may lead to changes in decision-making. Contraceptives are an important part of family planning, particularly during times of high disease activity. All forms of contraceptives are acceptable in patients with IBD, although there are specific considerations. The risks of combined oral contraceptives outweigh the benefits in patients with active disease and patients with prior or high risk for thromboembolism. Oral contraceptives and IBD are independently associated with an increased risk for thromboembolism, although it is not known whether this effect is compounding. Depot medroxyprogesterone  injection should be avoided in patients with or at risk for osteopenia. Intrauterine devices and implants are the most effective form of contraception and should be a first-line recommendation. The use of oral contraceptives is associated with the development of IBD, although there is no increased risk of disease relapse with the use of any form of contraceptive.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708794>Peripheral inflammation is associated with remote global gene expression changes in the brain.</a></h2><p>Although the central nervous system (CNS) was once considered an immunologically privileged site, in recent years it has become increasingly evident that cross talk between the immune system and the CNS does occur. As a result, patients with chronic  , such as rheumatoid arthritis,  or psoriasis, are often further burdened with neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as depression, anxiety and fatigue. Despite the recent advances in our understanding of neuroimmune communication pathways, the precise effect of peripheral immune activation on neural circuitry remains unclear. Utilizing transcriptomics in a well-characterized murine model of systemic inflammation, we have started to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which inflammation originating in the periphery can induce transcriptional modulation in the brain.Several different systemic and tissue-specific models of peripheral toll-like-receptor-(TLR)-driven (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid and Imiquimod) and sterile (tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA)) inflammation were induced in C57BL/6 mice. Whole brain transcriptional profiles were assessed and compared 48 hours after intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide or vehicle, using Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays. Target gene induction, identified by microarray analysis, was validated independently using qPCR. Expression of the same panel of target genes was then investigated in a number of sterile and other TLR-dependent models of peripheral inflammation.Microarray analysis of whole brains collected 48 hr after LPS challenge revealed increased transcription of a range of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the brain. In addition to acute LPS challenge, ISGs were induced in the brain following both chronic LPS-induced systemic inflammation and Imiquimod-induced skin inflammation. Unique to the brain, this transcriptional response is indicative of peripherally triggered, interferon-mediated CNS inflammation. Similar models of sterile inflammation and lipoteichoic-acid-induced systemic inflammation did not share the capacity to trigger ISG induction in the brain.These data highlight ISG induction in the brain as being a consequence of a TLR-induced type I interferon response. As considerable evidence links type I interferons to psychiatric disorders, we hypothesize that interferon production in the brain could represent an important mechanism, linking peripheral TLR-induced inflammation with behavioural changes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17948750>[Endometriosis].</a></h2><p>The major symptom is dysmenorrhea.

We transplanted feces from IMQ mice to germ-free IQI/Jic (IQI) mice and fed them DSS to assess the effect of the gut microbiome on disease.We first confirmed that IMQ mice showed accelerated DSS . IMQ mice had decreased numbers of IgD and IgM B cells and increased numbers of non-cytokine-producing macrophages in the gut. Moreover, the gut microbiomes of IMQ mice were perturbed, with significant reductions of  and  populations. Germ-free mice transplanted with feces from IMQ mice, but not with feces from untreated mice, also developed exacerbated DSS .These results suggest that skin inflammation may contribute to pathogenic conditions in the gut via immunologic and microbiological changes.

Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of α-amyrin  was compared to the amyrin derivatives, α-amyrin and β-amyrin. All displayed a suppressive effect on Th17 polarization and all reduced the expression of single transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt), which are crucial transcription factors regulating Th17 differentiation. α-Amyrin , however, exhibited the most prominent effects, which indicates that the functional group, , might strengthen the inhibitory effect on Th17 differentiation.Taken together, these results suggest that the extract of F. rhynchophylla and its active constituent, α-amyrin , could be applied as a potential therapeutic agent for autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.Copyright © 2019.

Several studies have reported that IBD is associated with impairment in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, mainly , propionate, and butyrate. They are produced in the large  by anaerobic bacterial fermentation of undigested dietary carbohydrates and fiber polysaccharides, with butyrate being considered as the major fuel source for colonocytes. These SCFAs have been proposed to play a key role in the maintenance of colonic homeostasis. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider therapeutic approaches that increase colonic SCFA production, as it can be achieved by administration of dietary fiber to IBD patients.

Investigating the effect of ulinastatin on GMA is required for combination therapy since the inhibition of serine protease suppresses the reaction of GMA. To clarify the effects of ulinastatin on GMA, we investigated whether granulocyte adsorption to cellulose  beads (carriers for GMA) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) release were inhibited by ulinastatin. Peripheral blood containing ulinastatin, a different serine protease inhibitor (gabexate mesilate), or signal-transduction inhibitors was incubated with cellulose  beads in vitro, and the ratios of adsorbed granulocytes and IL-1ra release were measured. Granulocyte adsorption and IL-1ra release were significantly suppressed with increasing gabexate mesilate concentrations; however, the adsorption was not significantly inhibited by ulinastatin. Furthermore, IL-1ra release was augmented by the addition of a high dose of ulinastatin or PD98059 as compared to a low dose. The activation levels of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase may regulate IL-1ra release induced by the carrier, because both ulinastatin and PD98059 inhibit extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase. High concentrations of ulinastatin increased IL-1ra release without inhibiting granulocyte adsorption to cellulose  beads.

However, the underlying mechanism of its anti-inflammatory effect is poorly understood.In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of EtOAc fractions of H. attenuatum Choisy (Ha-EtOAc) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 macrophage inflammation and hypothesized that Ha-EtOAc could attenuate inflammation in the colon.LPS was utilized to induce RAW264.7 cells inflammation. The anti-inflammatory effect of Ha-EtOAc in RAW264.7 cells was evaluated by measuring the inhibition ratio of nitric oxide (NO) production. Murine ulcerative  (UC) was induced by treatment with 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The basic indexes of the mice, including body weight, food intake and hematochezia, were recorded during mice experiments.The expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β, were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Additionally, the influences of Ha-EtOAc on the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways were determined by western blot and immunofluorescence assays. In addition, the impact of Ha-EtOAc on gut microbiota of mice with UC was detected by 16S rDNA sequencing.Ha-EtOAc inhibited the LPS-induced production of NO and decreased the release of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, pretreatment with Ha-EtOAc could suppress the nuclear translocation of p65 and the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, p38 and JNK. Ha-EtOAc treatment ameliorated murine UC, as reflected by a reduced body weight loss, improved colon shortening, alleviated mucosal damage and decreased releases of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, Ha-EtOAc could modulate the composition of microbial communities.Our results demonstrated that Ha-EtOAc exhibited anti-inflammatory effects mainly by suppressing the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, and Ha-EtOAc treatment may be a potent therapy for the treatment of ulcerative .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

In parallel with exacerbated loss of inhibitor of kappa B alpha expression, NI + AI rats showed hyperacetylation of histone H4K12 and increased V-Rel Avian Reticuloendotheliosis Viral Oncogene Homolog A binding on the  promoter, accompanied by high levels of norepinephrine/epinephrine. Propranolol, a β-blocker, markedly ameliorated the inflammatory response and IL1β overexpression by mitigating against epigenetic modifications. Adrenalectomy abrogated NI-induced disease susceptibility whereas yohimbine sensitized the epithelium for exacerbated immune response. The macrophages of NI rats produced more IL1β than controls after exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), suggesting hypersensitization; incubation with LPS plus Foradil (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), a β2-agonist, induced a greater IL1β expression than LPS alone. Epinephrine and Foradil also exacerbated LPS-induced IL1β activation in human THP-1-derived macrophages, by increasing acetylated H4K12, and these increases were abrogated by propranolol.NI sensitizes the colon epithelium for exacerbated IL1β activation by increasing stress hormones that induce histone hyperacetylation, allowing greater access of nuclear factor-κB to the  promoter and rendering the host susceptible to aggravated immune responses. Our findings suggest that β blockers have a therapeutic potential for inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility and establish a novel paradigm whereby NI induces epigenetic susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30146488>Quiescent Endothelial Cells Upregulate Fatty Acid β-Oxidation for Vasculoprotection via Redox Homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Little is known about the metabolism of quiescent endothelial cells (QECs). Nonetheless, when dysfunctional, QECs contribute to multiple diseases. Previously, we demonstrated that proliferating endothelial cells (PECs) use fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) for de novo dNTP synthesis. We report now that QECs are not hypometabolic, but upregulate FAO >3-fold higher than PECs, not to support biomass or energy production but to sustain the tricarboxylic acid cycle for redox homeostasis through NADPH regeneration. Hence, endothelial loss of FAO-controlling CPT1A in CPT1A mice promotes EC dysfunction (leukocyte infiltration, barrier disruption) by increasing endothelial oxidative stress, rendering CPT1A mice more susceptible to LPS and inflammatory bowel disease. Mechanistically, Notch1 orchestrates the use of FAO for redox balance in QECs. Supplementation of  (metabolized to acetyl-coenzyme A) restores endothelial quiescence and counters oxidative stress-mediated EC dysfunction in CPT1A mice, offering therapeutic opportunities. Thus, QECs use FAO for vasculoprotection against oxidative stress-prone exposure.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

After two days of diet, mice were treated with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce . Disease severity was assessed daily. Colonic tissues were analyzed for cytokine expression using the MesoScale discovery platform. Intestinal dextran permeability and serum lipopolysaccharide levels (LPS) were measured. Gut microbiota were analyzed by 16s rRNA sequencing and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations by gas chromatography. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were incubated with LPS and cytokine secretion measured. Mice on a high sugar diet had increased gut permeability, decreased microbial diversity and reduced SCFA. BMDM derived from high sugar fed mice were highly responsive to LPS. High sugar fed mice had increased susceptibility to  and pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations. Oral  significantly attenuated  in mice by restoring permeability.

There are no orally available agents that modulate the fractalkine/CX3CR1 axis. [(3,4)-1-[2-Chloro-6-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl]-3-{[1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-ylmethyl)piperidin-4-yl]carbamoyl}-4-methylpyrrolidin-3-yl]acetic acid (2S)-hydroxy(phenyl) (E6130) is an orally available highly selective modulator of CX3CR1 that may be effective for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. We found that E6130 inhibited the fractalkine-induced chemotaxis of human peripheral blood natural killer cells (IC 4.9 nM), most likely via E6130-induced down-regulation of CX3CR1 on the cell surface. E6130 had agonistic activity via CX3CR1 with respect to guanosine 5'-3--(thio)triphosphate binding in CX3CR1-expressing Chinese hamster ovary K1 (CHO-K1) membrane and had no antagonistic activity. Orally administered E6130 ameliorated several inflammatory bowel disease-related parameters in a murine CD4CD45RB T-cell-transfer  model and a murine oxazolone-induced  model. In the CD4CD45RB T-cell transfer model, E6130 inhibited the migration of CX3CR1 immune cells and decreased the number of these cells in the gut mucosal membrane.

The growth stimulatory effect of the E. limosum metabolites on T84 cells was evaluated by SUDH activity, and the anti- effect by IL-6 production. The change in mRNA of toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) was evaluated by real time PCR. Colitis was induced by feeding BALB/C mice with 2.0% dextran sodium sulfate. These mice received either 5% lyophilized E. limosum (n = 7) or control diet (n = 7). Seven days after colitis induction, clinical and histological scores, colon length, and cecal organic acid levels were determined.The E. limosum produced butyrate, , propionate, and lactate at 0.25, 1.0, 0.025 and 0.07 mmol/L, respectively in medium. At this concentration, each acid had no growth stimulating activity on T84 cells; however, when these acids were mixed together at the above levels, it showed significantly high activity than control. Except for lactate, these acids significantly attenuated IL-6 production at just 0.1 mmol/L. In addition, under TNF-alpha stimulation, butyrate attenuated the production of TLR4 mRNA. The treatment with E. limosum significantly attenuated clinical and histological scores of colitis with an increase of cecal butyrate levels, compared with the control group.E. limosum can ameliorate experimental colonic inflammation.

Each group of mice was matched with a similar group of sham control animals. Macroscopic and histological features were scored blindly. Homogenates of the colonic mucosa were assessed for myeloperoxidase activity as a biochemical marker of inflammation and DNA adducts (8OH-dG) as a measure of oxidative damage.DSS produced submucosal erosions, ulcers,  cell infiltration and cryptic abscesses which were reduced in both groups of mice receiving either anti-TNFα alone or combined with zinc. The effect was more pronounced in the latter group (vs Zn diet, P < 0.02).

It remains a challenging condition to treat because of the highly inflammatory nature of the disease, the prominent cognitive issues, and the limited knowledge about the efficacy and safety of current available disease-modifying therapies. Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of drugs licensed for adult-onset MS and several of them, although not tested in PedMS, are currently being used off-label in this population. To date, interferon-beta and glatiramer  are the most commonly used first-line treatments in children, although the efficacy and safety of these drugs have only been studied in observational cohorts and in unblinded randomized controlled trials. For children with breakthrough disease, escalation to higher efficacious second-line therapies, such as natalizumab, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and daclizumab may be considered. Large observational studies showed natalizumab is an effective treatment with safety and efficacy comparable to those in adult populations. The safety, efficacy, and tolerability of the other second-line treatments in PedMS have been reported only in small size retrospective case series. Large phase III studies are underway which will provide important information regarding the efficacy and safety of fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate in PedMS. Symptomatic treatments for fatigue, spasticity, depression, bladder and bowel dysfunction, and neuropathic pain should be considered in PedMS, especially when these symptoms impact the quality of life.

GMP is a putative prebiotic based on extensive glycosylation with sialic acid, galactose, and galactosamine. Our objective was to determine the prebiotic properties of GMP by characterizing cecal and fecal microbiota populations, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and immune responses. Weanling PKU (Pah(enu2)) and wild-type (WT) C57Bl/6 mice were fed isoenergetic AA, GMP, or casein diets for 8 wk. The cecal content and feces were collected for microbial DNA extraction to perform 16S microbiota analysis by Ion Torrent PGM sequencing. SCFA were determined by gas chromatography, plasma cytokines via a Bio-Plex Pro assay, and splenocyte T cell populations by flow cytometry. Changes in cecal and fecal microbiota are primarily diet dependent. The GMP diet resulted in a reduction from 30-35 to 7% in Proteobacteria, genera Desulfovibrio, in both WT and PKU mice with genotype-dependent changes in Bacteroidetes or Firmicutes. Cecal concentrations of the SCFA , propionate, and butyrate were increased with GMP. The percentage of stimulated spleen cells producing interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was significantly reduced in mice fed GMP compared with casein. In summary, plasma concentrations of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-2 were reduced in mice fed GMP. GMP is a prebiotic based on reduction in Desulfovibrio, increased SCFA, and lower indexes of inflammation compared with casein and AA diets in mice.

Ablation of bone marrow-derived myeloid cells exacerbated plaque pathology, whereas weekly administration of glatiramer  enhanced cerebral recruitment of innate immune cells, which dampened the pathology. Here, we assessed the therapeutic potential of grafted CD115(+) monocytes, injected once monthly into the peripheral blood of transgenic APPSWE/PS1ΔE9 Alzheimer's disease mouse models, with and without weekly immunization of glatiramer , as compared to glatiramer  alone. All immune-modulation treatment groups were compared with age-matched phosphate-buffered saline-injected control transgenic and untreated non-transgenic mouse groups. Two independent cohorts of mice were assessed for behavioural performance (6-8 mice/group); treatments started in 10-month-old symptomatic mice and spanned a total of 2 months. For all three treatments, our data suggest a substantial decrease in cognitive deficit as assessed by the Barnes maze test (P < 0.0001-0.001). Improved cognitive function was associated with synaptic preservation and reduction in cerebral amyloid-β protein levels and astrogliosis (P < 0.001 and P < 0.0001), with no apparent additive effects for the combined treatment. The peripherally grafted, green fluorescent protein-labelled and endogenous monocytes, homed to cerebral amyloid plaques and directly engulfed amyloid-β; their recruitment was further enhanced by glatiramer . In glatiramer -immunized mice and, moreover, in the combined treatment group, monocyte recruitment to the brain was coupled with greater elevation of the regulatory cytokine IL10 surrounding amyloid-β plaques. All treated transgenic mice had increased cerebral levels of MMP9 protein (P < 0.05), an enzyme capable of degrading amyloid-β, which was highly expressed by the infiltrating monocytes. In vitro studies using primary cultures of bone marrow monocyte-derived macrophages, demonstrated that glatiramer  enhanced the ability of macrophages to phagocytose preformed fibrillar amyloid-β1-42 (P < 0.0001). These glatiramer -treated macrophages exhibited increased expression of the scavenger receptors CD36 and SCARA1 (encoded by MSR1), which can facilitate amyloid-β phagocytosis, and the amyloid-β-degrading enzyme MMP9 (P < 0.0001-0.001). Overall, our studies indicate that increased cerebral infiltration of monocytes, either by enrichment of their levels in the circulation or by weekly immunization with glatiramer , resulted in substantial attenuation of disease progression in murine Alzheimer's models by mechanisms that involved enhanced cellular uptake and enzymatic degradation of toxic amyloid-β as well as regulation of brain inflammation.© The Author (2015).

Since then, the process has been further refined and 2 blood perfusion systems using membrane filtration are presently employed in Japan and Europe for the selective removal of leukocytes in patients with IBD: Cellsorba is a column of polyethylenephtarate fibers that captures lymphocytes and granulocytes, and Adacolumn is a column of cellulose  beads that selectively adsorb granulocytes and monocytes. These systems overcome the limitations of centrifugation. Leukocytapheresis has been shown to exert an overall anti- effect, as peripheral leukocytes demonstrated a diminished capacity to produce  cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1beta. In addition, down-regulation in the expression of adhesion molecule L-selectin and a shift toward a more immature granulocyte phenotype were observed in the peripheral blood.

Cytokine expression from unstimulated lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) was compared by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Immunohistochemistry of mucosal biopsies was performed. Cell populations were quantified by morphometry.CVID/IBD PB T cells stimulated by anti-CD3+CD28 had trends for reduced IL-2, IL-10, IFN-γ, and TNF-α compared to controls. These differences were not apparent following stimulation by PHA/PMA. Constitutive production of  cytokines by LPLs was not detected. Histologically, CVID patients had reduced/absent plasma cells with reductions in intestinal IgM and IgA. CVID patients with and without gastrointestinal (GI)  exhibited increased CD3+ T cells, specifically CD8+, in the colon compared to normal and IBD controls, suggesting immune dysregulation.Intestinal inflammation in CVID patients with IBD-like  may be mediated by abnormal cytokine production through a T-cell receptor-mediated pathway.

Adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) is associated with CD, yet the adaptations facilitating AIEC gut colonization are unknown. AIEC isolates exhibit high genetic diversity, suggesting strains evolve independently across different gut environments. We tracked the adaptive evolution of AIEC in a murine model of chronic colonization across multiple hosts and transmission events. We detected evolved lineages that outcompeted the ancestral strain in the host through independent mechanisms. One lineage was hypermotile because of a mobile insertion sequence upstream of the master flagellar regulator, flhDC, which enhanced AIEC invasion and establishment of a mucosal niche. Another lineage outcompeted the ancestral strain through improved use of , a short-chain fatty acid in the gut. The presence of hypermotile and -consuming lineages discriminated E. coli isolated from CD patients from healthy controls, suggesting an evolutionary trajectory that distinguishes AIEC from commensal E. coli.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

They modulate different processes in the gastrointestinal tract and play various positive roles in mediating the intestinal health. Most beneficial roles of SCFAs in the gastrointestinal tract are mediated by directly activating its receptor, G protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43, also known as FFAR2). Various recent studies have demonstrated the role of GPR43 in intestinal inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases. These SCFAs-mediated regulations of intestinal health are associated with neutrophil chemotaxis, T cell differentiation, activation, and subsequent cytokines production. Therefore, GPR43 could potentially be a drug target for intestinal inflammatory diseases. In this review, we review the current knowledge on the regulatory mechanisms associated with GPR43 in intestinal inflammation. The role of GPR43-mediated regulation of antibody responses is also discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15677903>Therapeutic effect of the immunomodulator glatiramer  on trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced experimental colitis.</a></h2><p> are characterized by detrimental immune reactivity in the gut and imbalance between proinflammatory and antiinflammatory reactivity.

Experimental colitis was induced by rectal instillation of TNBS in 3 mice strains: BALB/c, SJL/J, and (SJL/JXBALB/c)F1, and its severity was evaluated by gross colon injury, histologic damage, body weight, and survival rate. We studied the effect of GA on all these parameters as well as on lymphocyte reactivity manifested by proliferation and secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta. GA treatment significantly suppressed the various manifestations of TNBS-induced colitis as demonstrated by substantial reduction in the macroscopic colonic damage, preservation of the microscopic colonic structure, reduced weight loss, and improved long-term survival, in GA treated mice compared with untreated mice. The parenteral route was more effective than the oral route. GA suppressed the proliferation of local mesenteric lymphocytes to syngeneic colon extract and the detrimental tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion. In addition, it induced a beneficial secretion of transforming growth factor-beta.

The relative potency of methylprednisolone to hydrocortisone is at least four is to one. The aim of the present research was to develop a colon targeted drug delivery for treatment of IBD.  Compression coated drug delivery system was designed and optimised. Core tablet contained drug, croscarmellose sodium (CCS-superdisintegrant), avicel (binder) and dicalcium phosphate (diluent). Design of experiment with 3 factorial design was applied for optimization of compression coated delivery. Chitosan and cellulose  phthalate were chosen as independent variables. Swelling index, hardness and % drug release were dependant variables.  Core tablet (C5 batch) containing 2.15% CCS showed disintegration in less than 10sec. FTIR, UV and DSC study had shown absence of any significant physical and chemical interaction between drug and polymers. F8 was found to be optimised formulation. F8 contained 35% chitosan and 17.5% cellulose  phthalate. It showed drug release of 86.3% ± 6.1%, hardness 6.5 ± 1.5 and lag time 7 hrs. Simulated media drug release was 97.51 ± 8.6% with 7.5 hrs lag time.

Furthermore, molecular docking was performed to study the binding mode of these compounds into the active site of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).A. officinarum rhizomes were extracted by maceration, using methanol. This extract was further fractionated by partitioning with hexane, chloroform and ethyl  and these fractions on further purification resulted in isolation of five pure compounds. Characterization was carried out by using (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and MS. They were further evaluated for antioxidant and anti- activity using carrageenan-induced paw edema model in rats. Molecular docking study was performed using Glide module integrated in Schrodinger molecular modeling software.The compounds were identified as 1,7-diphenylhept-4-en-3-one (1), 5-hydroxy-1,7-diphenyl-3-heptanone (2), 3,5,7-trihydroxyflavone (Galangin, 3), 3,5,7-trihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone (Kaempferide, 4) and 5-hydroxy-7-(4″-hydroxy-3″-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenyl-3-heptanone (5). The compound-3 and compound-5 (10mg/kg) showed significant (p<0.001) antioxidant and anti- potential. Moreover, total phenolic content was detected as 72.96 mg and 51.18 mg gallic acid equivalent respectively. All the five isolates were found to be good binders with COX-2 (average docking score -9.03).Galangin and 5-hydroxy-7-(4″-hydroxy-3″-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenyl-3-heptanone exhibited anti- and in-vitro antioxidant activity which may be due to presence of phenolic content in it. The molecular docking study revealed that these compounds have affinity towards COX-2 active site which can further be explored as selective COX-2 inhibitors.

SCFA-dependent modulation of NF-kappaB reporter activity was assessed in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, Colo320DM. Finally, the effect of SCFAs on gene expression and cytokine release, measured with RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively, was studied in mouse colon organ cultures established from colitic mice., propionate and butyrate at 30 mmol/L decreased LPS-stimulated TNFalpha release from neutrophils, without affecting IL-8 protein release. All SCFAs dose dependently inhibited NF-kappaB reporter activity in Colo320DM cells. Propionate dose-dependently suppressed IL-6 mRNA and protein release from colon organ cultures and comparative studies revealed that propionate and butyrate at 30 mmol/L caused a strong inhibition of immune-related gene expression, whereas  was less effective. A similar inhibition was achieved with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, but not the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. All SCFAs decreased IL-6 protein release from organ cultures.In the present study propionate and butyrate were equipotent, whereas  was less effective, at suppressing NF-kappaB reporter activity, immune-related gene expression and cytokine release in vitro.

Thus, we hypothesized that the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, is important in the maintenance and regulation of the barrier function of the colonic epithelium.Confluent monolayers of the human colon-derived T84 or HT-29 epithelial cell lines were exposed to dinitrophenol (DNP (0.1 mM), uncouples oxidative phosphorylation) + Escherichia coli (strain HB101, 10(6) cfu) +/- butyrate (3-50 mM). Transepithelial resistance (TER), and bacterial internalization and translocation were assessed over a 24-hour period. Epithelial ultrastructure was assessed by transmission electron microscopy.Epithelia under metabolic stress display decreased TER and increased numbers of pseudopodia that is consistent with increased internalization and translocation of the E. coli. Butyrate (but not ) significantly reduced the bacterial translocation across DNP-treated epithelia but did not ameliorate the drop in TER in the DNP+E. coli exposed monolayers. Inhibition of bacterial transcytosis across metabolically stressed epithelia was associated with reduced I-kappaB phosphorylation and hence NF-kappaB activation.Reduced butyrate-producing bacteria could result in increased epithelial permeability particularly in the context of concomitant exposure to another stimulus that reduces mitochondria function. We speculate that prebiotics, the substrate for butyrate synthesis, is a valuable prophylaxis in the regulation of epithelial permeability and could be of benefit in preventing relapses in IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707247>Toxicity of hydrogen sulfide toward sulfate-reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio piger Vib-7.</a></h2><p>Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) belonging to the intestinal microbiota are the main producers of hydrogen sulfide and their increasing amount due to the accumulation of this compound in the bowel are involved in the initiation and maintenance of inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this experiment is to study the relative toxicity of hydrogen sulfide and survival of Desulfovibrio piger Vib-7 through monitoring: sulfate reduction parameters (sulfate consumption, hydrogen sulfide production, lactate consumption and  production) and kinetic parameters of these processes. The research is highlighting the survival of intestinal SRB, D. piger Vib-7 under the influence of different hydrogen sulfide concentrations (1-7 mM). The highest toxicity of HS was measured in the presence of concentrations higher than 6 mM, where growing was stopped, though metabolic activities were not 100% inhibited. These findings are confirmed by cross correlation and principal component analysis that clearly supported the above mentioned results. The kinetic parameters of bacterial growth and sulfate reduction were inhibited proportionally with increasing HS concentration. The presence of 5 mM HS resulted in two times longer lag phase and generation time was eight times longer. Maximum rate of growth and hydrogen production was stopped under 4 mM, emphasizing the HS toxicity concentrations to be < 4 mM, even for sulfide producing bacteria such as Desulfovibrio. The results are confirming HS concentrations toxicity toward Desulfovibrio, especially the study novelty should be emphasized where it was found that the exact HS limits (> 4 mM) toward this bacterial strain inhabiting humans and animals intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30068593>Glatiramer  Enhances Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cell Function via Recognition of Paired Ig-like Receptor B.</a></h2><p>Glatiramer  (GA; Copaxone) is a copolymer therapeutic that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis. Despite an unclear mechanism of action, studies have shown that GA promotes protective Th2 immunity and stimulates release of cytokines that suppress autoimmunity. In this study, we demonstrate that GA interacts with murine paired Ig-like receptor B (PIR-B) on myeloid-derived suppressor cells and suppresses the STAT1/NF-κB pathways while promoting IL-10/TGF-β cytokine release. In inflammatory bowel disease models, GA enhanced myeloid-derived suppressor cell-dependent CD4 regulatory T cell generation while reducing proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Human monocyte-derived macrophages responded to GA by reducing TNF-α production and promoting CD163 expression typical of alternative maturation despite the presence of GM-CSF. Furthermore, GA competitively interacts with leukocyte Ig-like receptors B (LILRBs), the human orthologs of PIR-B. Because GA limited proinflammatory activation of myeloid cells, therapeutics that target LILRBs represent novel treatment modalities for autoimmune indications.Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28402523>Role of short-chain fatty acids in colonic inflammation, carcinogenesis, and mucosal protection and healing.</a></h2><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), mainly , propionate, and butyrate, produced by microbial fermentation of undigested food substances are believed to play a beneficial role in human gut health. Short-chain fatty acids influence colonic health through various mechanisms. In vitro and ex vivo studies show that SCFAs have anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic effects, play an important role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in colonocytes, and protect colonocytes from external harm. Animal studies have found substantial positive effects of SCFAs or dietary fiber on colonic disease, but convincing evidence in humans is lacking. Most human intervention trials have been conducted in the context of inflammatory bowel disease. Only a limited number of those trials are of high quality, showing little or no favorable effect of SCFA treatment over placebo. Opportunities for future research include exploring the use of combination therapies with anti-inflammatory drugs, prebiotics, or probiotics; the use of prodrugs in the setting of carcinogenesis; or the direct application of SCFAs to improve mucosal healing after colonic surgery.© The Author(s) 2017.

In order to clarify the mechanism of the anti- effects of CA, global analysis of the molecules generated in blood by the interaction with CA beads was performed in this study. An activated medium was collected from whole blood that had been preincubated with CA beads, and the effects of the CA-activated medium on leucocyte function were investigated. Fresh blood was stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interferon (IFN)-β in the presence of the activated medium, and levels of chemokines and cytokines, including CXCL10 (IFN-inducible protein-10), and phosphorylated STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1), which is known to be essential for CXCL10 production in leucocytes, were measured. IFN-β- or LPS-induced CXCL10 production, expression of CXCL10 mRNA and phosphorylation of STAT1 were significantly reduced in the presence of the medium pretreated with CA beads compared with the control without the CA bead treatment. The factors inhibiting CXCL10 production were identified as the C3 and C4 fragments by mass spectrometry. The monomeric C3bi and C4b proteins were abundant in the medium pretreated with CA beads. Furthermore, purified C3bi and C4b were found to inhibit IFN-β-induced CXCL10 production and STAT1 phosphorylation. Thus, STAT1-mediated CXCL10 production induced by stimulation with LPS or IFN was potently inhibited by monomeric C3bi and C4b generated by the interaction of blood with CA beads. These mechanisms mediated by monomeric C3bi and C4b may be involved in the anti- effects of CA.© 2011 The Authors.

We performed a comparative assessment of the capacity of the microbiota for butyrate synthesis, by quantifying butyryl-CoA: CoA-transferase [BCoAT] gene content in stool from patients with Crohn's disease [CD; n = 71], ulcerative  [UC; n = 58] and controls [n = 75], and determined whether it was related to active vs inactive inflammation, microbial diversity, and composition and/or dietary habits.BCoAT gene content was quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR]. Disease activity was assessed clinically and faecal calprotectin concentration measured. Microbial composition was determined by sequencing 16S rRNA gene. Dietary data were collected using an established food frequency questionnaire.Reduced butyrate-synthetic capacity was found in patients with active and inactive CD [p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively], but only in active UC [p < 0.05]. In CD, low BCoAT gene content was associated with ileal location, stenotic behaviour, increased inflammation, lower microbial diversity, greater microbiota compositional change, and decreased butyrogenic taxa. Reduced BCoAT gene content in patients with CD was linked with a different regimen characterised by lower dietary fibre.Reduced butyrate-synthetic capacity of the microbiota is more evident in CD than UC and may relate to reduced fibre intake. The results suggest that simple replacement of butyrate per se may be therapeutically inadequate, whereas manipulation of microbial synthesis, perhaps by dietary means, may be more appropriate.Copyright © 2017 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

SCFAs bind to G protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43). Here, we show that SCFA-GPR43 interactions profoundly affect the gut  response.Colitis was induced by adding dextran sulfate sodium to the drinking water of GPR43 knockout (-/-) and wild-type mice.Dextran sulfate sodium-treated GPR43 mice exhibited weight loss, increased  activity index (a combined measure of weight loss, rectal bleeding, and stool consistency), decreased hematocrit, and colon shortening, resulting in significantly worse colonic inflammation than in wild-type mice. Tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 17 protein levels in the colonic mucosa of GPR43 mice were significantly higher than in wild-type mice. Treatment of wild-type mice with 150 mM  in their drinking water markedly improved these  indices, with an increase in colon length and decrease in the  activity index; however, it had no effect on GPR43 mice.

Therefore, removal of activated circulating leukocytes by apheresis has the potential for improving UC. In Japan, since April 2000, leukocytapheresis using Adacolumn has been approved as the treatment for active UC by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The Adacolumn is an extracorporeal leukocyte apheresis device filled with cellulose  beads, and selectively adsorbs granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages. To assess the safety and clinical efficacy of granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis (GMCAP) for UC, we reviewed 10 open trials of the use of GMCAP to treat UC. One apheresis session (session time, 60 min) per week for five consecutive weeks (a total of five apheresis sessions) has been a standard protocol. Several studies used modified protocols with two sessions per week, with 90-min session, or with a total of 10 apheresis sessions. Typical adverse reactions were dizziness, nausea, headache, flushing, and fever. No serious adverse effects were reported during and after GMCAP therapy, and almost all the patients could complete the treatment course. GMCAP is safe and well-tolerated. In the majority of patients, GMCAP therapy achieved clinical remission or improvement. GMCAP is a useful alternative therapy for patients with steroid-refractory or -dependent UC. GMCAP should have the potential to allow tapering the dose of steroids, and is useful for shortening the time to remission and avoiding re-administration of steroids at the time of relapse. Furthermore, GMCAP may have efficacy as the first-line therapy for steroid-naive patients or patients who have the first attack of UC. However, most of the previous studies were uncontrolled trials. To assess a definite efficacy of GMCAP, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trials are necessary. A serious problem with GMCAP is cost; a single session costs 145 000 ($1 300). However, if this treatment prevents hospital admission, re-administration of steroids and surgery, and improves a quality of life of the patients, GMCAP may prove to be cost-effective.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30915065>Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)-Mediated Gut Epithelial and Immune Regulation and Its Relevance for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative  (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), collectively known as Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), are caused by a complex interplay between genetic, immunologic, microbial and environmental factors. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is increasingly considered to be causatively related to IBD and is strongly affected by components of a Western life style. Bacteria that ferment fibers and produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are typically reduced in mucosa and feces of patients with IBD, as compared to healthy individuals. SCFAs, such as , propionate and butyrate, are important metabolites in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Several studies have indeed shown that fecal SCFAs levels are reduced in active IBD. SCFAs are an important fuel for intestinal epithelial cells and are known to strengthen the gut barrier function. Recent findings, however, show that SCFAs, and in particular butyrate, also have important immunomodulatory functions. Absorption of SCFAs is facilitated by substrate transporters like MCT1 and SMCT1 to promote cellular metabolism. Moreover, SCFAs may signal through cell surface G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), like GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109A, to activate signaling cascades that control immune functions. Transgenic mouse models support the key role of these GPCRs in controlling intestinal inflammation. Here, we present an overview of microbial SCFAs production and their effects on the intestinal mucosa with specific emphasis on their relevance for IBD. Moreover, we discuss the therapeutic potential of SCFAs for IBD, either applied directly or by stimulating SCFAs-producing bacteria through pre- or probiotic approaches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20067801>Food-derived bioactives as potential regulators of the IL-12/IL-23 pathway implicated in .</a></h2><p>The gene-specific modulation of  cytokines by food bioactives represents a possible approach to the nutritional or pharmaceutical prevention and treatment of  (IBD). There is evidence for a key role of the interleukin-12beta1/23 receptor (IL-12 Rbeta1/23 R) pathway in IBD, and that reduction of the normal expression of the IL-23 R gene may provide a therapeutic target for this . The binding of interleukin-23 (IL-23) to its receptor IL-23 R regulates a newly defined effector T-cell subset, Th17 cells, characterised by the production of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and other cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). In this study we developed an assay that measured IL-17 and TNF-alpha expression after incubation with specific dietary bioactives in the human T-cell Kit 225. It is anticipated that these changes will reflect differences in IL-23 R production, albeit indirectly. The cell line Kit 225 has similarities to Th17 cells, a subset of T cells producing IL-17 and TNF-alpha, and in initial experiments we demonstrated that the cells express both IL-23 receptor subunits, as well as IL-17 and TNF-alpha genes. Upon verification that stimulation of Kit 225 cells with 1ng/mL IL-23 significantly upregulated IL-17 and TNF-alpha gene expression, and IL-17 production, we supplemented cells with selected food bioactives, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and linoleic acid (LA), and with phorbol myristate  (PMA) and sodium salicylate, used as pro- and anti- controls, respectively. In both unstimulated cells and after IL-23 stimulation, bioactives modulated the pro- cytokines involved in IBD, underlining the possible role of foods in this . EGCG and DHA, which significantly inhibited both IL-17 and TNF-alpha expression, appeared particularly interesting.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The gut milieu represents the largest mucosal surface exposed to microorganisms with 10(10-12) colony forming bacteria/g of colonic content. Approximately, one third of fecal dry matter is made of bacteria/ bacterial components. Indeed, the normal gut microbiota is responsible for healthy digestion of dietary fibers (polysaccharides) and fermentation of short chain fatty acids such as  and butyrate that provide carbon sources (fuel) for these bacteria.  (IBD) results in breakage of the mucosal barrier, an altered microbiota and dysregulated gut immunity.

The therapeutic effect of the immunomodulatory drug glatiramer  (GA, Copaxone, copolymer 1) has been established in several IBD models, including trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, as well as in a spontaneous colitis model. In the present study we investigated the mechanism of action of GA and cells specifically induced by it. Immunization of naive mice by GA, generated a lymphocyte population of the Th2/3 subtype, that drastically reduced  manifestations upon their adoptive transfer to mice with DSS colitis. This was demonstrated by the substantial decrease in weight loss, intestinal bleeding and diarrhea, as well as by the prevention of macroscopic and microscopic colonic damage. In contrast, adoptive transfer of control lysozyme-specific cells did not induce any beneficial effect on the . Moreover, GA-specific short-term T-cell lines, either exogenously labeled or genetically marked, adoptively transferred by the intraperitoneal route to colitis-induced mice, localized in the inner layers of the colon and secreted in situ the regulatory cytokine TGF-beta. These results demonstrate the accumulation of GA-specific Th2/3 cells secreting regulatory cytokines in the injured colon, and thus draw a direct linkage between the therapeutic effect of GA in IBD and an immunomodulatory effect at the site in which the pathological process occurs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18023089>Selective decrease in colonic CD56(+) T and CD161(+) T cells in the inflamed mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p>To investigate the role of local colonic mucosal NK receptor-positive T (NKR(+) T) cells in the regulation of intestinal inflammation, we analyzed the population and function of these cells in ulcerative colitis (UC).Colonic mucosal tissues were obtained from colonoscopic biopsies of the descending colon from 96 patients with UC (51 endoscopically uninflamed, 45 inflamed) and 18 normal controls. Endoscopic appearance and histologic score at the biopsied site were determined by Matts' classification. A single cell suspension was prepared from each biopsy by collagenase digestion. Two NKR(+) T cell subsets, CD56(+) (CD56(+)CD3(+)) T cells and CD161(+) (CD161(+)CD3(+)) T cells, were detected by flow cytometric analysis. Intracellular cytokine analysis for anti- cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) was performed by in vitro stimulation with phorbol-myristate- (PMA) and ionomycin.CD56(+) T cells and CD161(+) T cells are present in the normal human colon and account for 6.7% and 21.3% of all mononuclear cells, respectively. The populations of both CD56(+) T cells and CD161(+) T cells were decreased significantly in the inflamed mucosa of UC. In contrast, the frequency of conventional T cells (CD56(-)CD3(+) cells and CD161(-)CD3(+) cells) was similar among the patient and control groups. The populations of NKR(+) T cells were correlated inversely with the severity of inflammation, which was classified according to the endoscopic and histologic Matts' criteria. Interestingly, approximately 4% of mucosal NKR(+) T cells expressing IL-10 were detected by in vitro stimulation with PMA and ionomycin.Selective reduction in the population of colonic mucosal NKR(+) T cells may contribute to the development of intestinal inflammation in UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24389673>Biological significance of short-chain fatty acid metabolism by the intestinal microbiome.</a></h2><p>Evidence suggests that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) derived from microbial metabolism in the gut play a central role in host homeostasis.

Established prebiotics, such as fructooligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides, which support the growth of Bifidobacteria, mainly mediate  production. Thus, recent identification of prebiotics which are able to stimulate the production of propionate and butyrate by benign saccharolytic populations in the colon is of interest.Manipulation of saccharolytic fermentation by prebiotic substrates is beginning to provide information on structure-function relationships relating to the production of SCFAs, which have multiple roles in host homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22401908>Larazotide  regulates epithelial tight junctions in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>Tight junctions (TJs) control paracellular permeability and apical-basolateral polarity of epithelial cells, and can be regulated by exogenous and endogenous stimuli. Dysregulated permeability is associated with pathological conditions, such as celiac  and . Herein we studied the mechanism by which larazotide , an 8-mer peptide and TJ regulator, inhibits the cellular changes elicited by gliadin fragments, AT-1002, and cytokines. Previously, we demonstrated that AT-1002, a 6-mer peptide derived from the Vibrio cholerae zonula occludens toxin ZOT, caused several biochemical changes in IEC6 and Caco-2 cells resulting in decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and increased TJ permeability. In this study, larazotide  inhibited the redistribution and rearrangement of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and actin caused by AT-1002 and gliadin fragments in Caco-2 and IEC6 cells. Functionally, larazotide  inhibited the AT-1002-induced TEER reduction and TJ opening in Caco-2 cells. Additionally, larazotide  inhibited the translocation of a gliadin 13-mer peptide, which has been implicated in celiac , across Caco-2 cell monolayers. Further, apically applied larazotide  inhibited the increase in TJ permeability elicited by basolaterally applied cytokines. Finally, when tested in vivo in gliadin-sensitized HLA-HCD4/DQ8 double transgenic mice, larazotide  inhibited gliadin-induced macrophage accumulation in the intestine and preserved normal TJ structure. Taken together, our data suggest that larazotide  inhibits changes elicited by AT-1002, gliadin, and cytokines in epithelial cells and preserves TJ structure and function in vitro and in vivo.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The present study was designed to explore the potential therapeutic effects of curcumin on visceral hyperalgesia and inflammation in a rat model of ulcerative . We observed the effects of orally administered curcumin on the disease activity index, histological change in colon, colorectal distension-induced abdominal withdrawal reflex, the expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and phosphorylated TRPV1 in dextran sulfate sodium-induced  rats. In addition, a HEK293 cell line stably expressing human TRPV1 (hTRPV1) was used to examine the effects of curcumin on the change in membrane expression of TRPV1 induced by phorbol myristate  (a protein kinase C activator). Results Repeated oral administration of curcumin inhibited the increase in abdominal withdrawal reflex score induced by dextran sulfate sodium without affecting dextran sulfate sodium-induced histological change of colon and the disease activity index. A significant increase in colonic expression of TRPV1 and pTRPV1 was observed in dextran sulfate sodium-treated rats and this was reversed by oral administration of curcumin. TRPV1 expression in L6-S1 dorsal root ganglion was increased in the small- to medium-sized isolectin B4-positive non-peptidergic and calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive peptidergic neurons in dextran sulfate sodium-treated rats and oral administration of curcumin mitigated such changes. In the HEK293 cell line stably expressing hTRPV1, curcumin (1, 3 µm) inhibited phorbol myristate -induced upregulation of membrane TRPV1. Conclusion Oral administration of curcumin alleviates visceral hyperalgesia in dextran sulfate sodium-induced  rats.

We investigated the possibility that reducing the level of these cells might promote remission of active UC.Thirty-one patients with active corticosteroid refractory (refractory) UC, mean age of 42 years, duration of UC 6 years, clinical activity index (CAI) of 15,  activity index (DAI) of 10, and 8 corticosteroid naive patients (naive), mean age of 36 years, duration of UC 2 years, CAI of 11, DAI of 8 were recruited. Each patient was treated with up to 11 cycles of granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis over 11 weeks by using a 335-mL capacity column filled with cellulose  beads that adsorb GM.At week 12, 81% of refractory (CAI, 3; P < 0.001 and DAI, 4; P < 0.001) and 88% of naive (CAI, 1; P = 0.012 and DAI, 3; P = 0.011) patients achieved remission. Early relapse was not a feature, and at 12 months, 26 of 33 patients had maintained their remission. The treatment was well tolerated, and no severe side effects were observed.The outcome of this study suggests that reduction of circulating granulocytes and monocytes results in alleviation of inflammation and promotes clinical remission in patients with severe active UC that has not responded to intensive corticosteroid treatment. These data suggest that formal controlled studies are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27537052>Treatment with a Urokinase Receptor-derived Cyclized Peptide Improves Experimental  by Preventing Monocyte Recruitment and Macrophage Polarization.</a></h2><p>Leukocyte migration across the blood barrier and into tissues represents a key process in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. The urokinase receptor (urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor) is a master regulator of leukocyte recruitment. We recently found that cyclization of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor-derived peptide Ser-Arg-Ser-Arg-Tyr [SRSRY] inhibits transendothelial migration of monocytes. Now, we have explored the effects of [SRSRY] administration during experimental .The effects of [SRSRY] on cytokine profile, cytoskeletal organization, and cell migration were investigated using phorbol-12-myristate -differentiated THP-1 cells exposed to polarizing stimuli. In vivo, [SRSRY] was intraperitoneally administered during dextran sodium sulfate- or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced  in wild-type or urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor knockout mice. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory monocytes in mucosal infiltrates were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry, respectively.[SRSRY] prevents M0 to M1 transition and migration of M1 polarized macrophages. In vivo, [SRSRY] reduces intestinal inflammation diminishing body weight loss and disease activity index. These beneficial effects are accompanied by a reduction of interleukin 1β, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor α, an increase of interleukin 10, and an abridged recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the inflamed tissue.Altogether, these findings indicate that [SRSRY] may be considered as a new drug useful for the pharmacological treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22152591>Effects of kiwifruit extracts on colonic gene and protein expression levels in IL-10 gene-deficient mice.</a></h2><p> (IBD) is a collective term for conditions characterised by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract involving an inappropriate immune response to commensal micro-organisms in a genetically susceptible host. Previously, aqueous and ethyl  extracts of gold kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) or green kiwifruit (A. deliciosa) have demonstrated anti- activity using in vitro models of IBD. The present study examined whether these kiwifruit extracts (KFE) had immune-modulating effects in vivo against  processes that are known to be increased in patients with IBD. KFE were used as a dietary intervention in IL-10-gene-deficient (Il10(-/-)) mice (an in vivo model of IBD) and the C57BL/6J background strain in a 3 × 2 factorial design. While all Il10(-/-) mice developed significant colonic inflammation compared with C57BL/6J mice, this was not affected by the inclusion of KFE in the diet. These findings are in direct contrast to our previous study where KFE reduced  signalling in primary cells isolated from Il10(-/-) and C57BL/6J mice. Whole-genome gene and protein expression level profiling indicated that KFE influenced immune signalling pathways and metabolic processes within the colonic tissue; however, the effects were subtle. In particular, expression levels across gene sets related to adaptive immune pathways were significantly reduced using three of the four KFE in C57BL/6J mice. The present study highlights the importance of investigating food components identified by cell-based assays with appropriate in vivo models before making dietary recommendations, as a food that looks promising in vitro may not be effective in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24363687>Comparative Study of Berberis vulgaris Fruit Extract and Berberine Chloride Effects on Acetic Acid-Induced Colitis in Rats.</a></h2><p>Antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects of anthocyanins are abundant in berberry fruits suggesting that they may have beneficial effects on  (IBD). The present study was carried out to investigate the anti-colitic effect of Berberis vulgaris fruit extract (BFE) compared to berberine chloride (BEC) and corticosteroids using an animal model of acetic acid induced experimental colitis. BFE with three different doses (375, 750, and 1500 mg/Kg) was administered orally or rectally prior to ulcer induction. BEC (10 mg/Kg), prednisolone (5 mg/Kg), hydrocortisone  enema (20 mg/Kg) and normal saline (5 mL/Kg) were considered as respective controls. The tissue was assessed macroscopically for damage scores, area, index and weight/length ratio. They were also examined histopathologically for inflammation extent and severity, crypt damage, invasion involvement and total colitis index. Results indicated that greater doses of oral BFE (750, 1500 mg/Kg) as well as BEC (10 mg/Kg) were effective to protect against colonic damage. By rectal pretreatment, the extract was only effective to diminish the ulcer index and the efficacy was not significant for mucosal inflammation parameters. In conclusion BFE, which is nearly devoid of berberine, was effective to protect against colitis and this might be attributed to its anthocyanin constituents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24058654>Inducible CYP2J2 and its product 11,12-EET promotes bacterial phagocytosis: a role for CYP2J2 deficiency in the pathogenesis of Crohn's ?</a></h2><p>The epoxygenase CYP2J2 has an emerging role in inflammation and vascular biology. The role of CYP2J2 in phagocytosis is not known and its regulation in human   is poorly understood. Here we investigated the role of CYP2J2 in bacterial phagocytosis and its expression in monocytes from healthy controls and Crohns  patients. CYP2J2 is anti- in human peripheral blood monocytes. Bacterial LPS induced CYP2J2 mRNA and protein. The CYP2J2 arachidonic acid products 11,12-EET and 14,15-EET inhibited LPS induced TNFα release. THP-1 monocytes were transformed into macrophages by 48h incubation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-. Epoxygenase inhibition using a non-selective inhibitor SKF525A or a selective CYP2J2 inhibitor Compound 4, inhibited E. coli particle phagocytosis, which could be specifically reversed by 11,12-EET. Moreover, epoxygenase inhibition reduced the expression of phagocytosis receptors CD11b and CD68. CD11b also mediates L. monocytogenes phagocytosis. Similar, to E. coli bioparticle phagocytosis, epoxygenase inhibition also reduced intracellular levels of L. monocytogenes, which could be reversed by co-incubation with 11,12-EET. Disrupted bacterial clearance is a hallmark of Crohn's . Unlike macrophages from control donors, macrophages from Crohn's  patients showed no induction of CYP2J2 in response to E. coli. These results demonstrate that CYP2J2 mediates bacterial phagocytosis in macrophages, and implicates a defect in the CYP2J2 pathway may regulate bacterial clearance in Crohn's .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20461070>Migration of eosinophils and CCR2-/CD68-double positive cells into the duodenal mucosa of patients with postinfectious functional dyspepsia.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have shown that postinfectious functional dyspepsia (FD) symptoms may persist after elimination of gastrointestinal (GI) infection as well as postinfectious irritable  syndrome accompanying colonic inflammation. However, it is unclear whether intestinal chronic inflammation can contribute to clinical symptoms of certain FD patients such as postinfectious FD. To determine the relationship between local inflammation of the duodenum and clinical symptoms, we evaluated the infiltration of several phenotypes of duodenal  cells as well as gastric motility using (13)C urea breath test in postinfectious FD patients.We enrolled 136 consecutive patients diagnosed with FD according to Rome III criteria, and 20 healthy controls, after upper GI endoscopy. Gastric motility was evaluated by gastric emptying time (T-max) using the (13)C- breath test. Upper abdominal symptoms including epigastric pain, epigastric burning, postprandial fullness, abdominal distension, and early satiety were assessed by questionnaire scores. We obtained biopsy specimens from the stomach and duodenum during upper GI endoscopy. Histological gastritis and duodenitis were assessed as mild, moderate, or severe according to previously described criteria. Characteristics of  cells and neuroendocrine cells were determined immunohistochemically with antibodies to CD3, CD68, CCR2, Vdelta1 TCR, and serotonin.Endoscopic duodenitis was observed in only 5.7% of postinfectious FD patients. However, the rates of histological duodenitis in duodenal biopsies of postinfectious FD patients were 17% for mild, 26% for moderate, and 57% for severe grades of duodenitis. The degree of histological duodenitis of postinfectious FD patients was significantly greater than that of healthy volunteers. There was a significant correlation between epigastric burning and the degree of duodenitis in postinfectious FD patients. There was no significant difference in histological duodenitis and T-max value in the postinfectious FD patients with or without Helicobacter pylori infection. In addition, CD68-positive cell number in postinfectious FD patients was significantly increased compared with the numbers in subjects with epigastric pain syndrome or postprandial distress syndrome and in healthy volunteers. CCR2-/CD68-double positive cell number in postinfectious FD patients was significantly (P=0.009) increased compared with those in healthy volunteers.Migration of  cells, in particular, duodenal CCR2-positive macrophages, may have an important function in the pathophysiology of postinfectious FD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30550821>Treatment of Active Crohn's Disease With an Ordinary Food-based Diet That Replicates Exclusive Enteral Nutrition.</a></h2><p>Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is the only established dietary treatment for Crohn's disease (CD), but its acceptability is limited. There is a need for novel dietary treatments for CD.We evaluated the effects of an individualized food-based diet (CD-TREAT), with similar composition to EEN, on the gut microbiome, inflammation, and clinical response in a rat model, healthy adults, and children with relapsing CD. Twenty-five healthy adults randomly received EEN or CD-TREAT for 7 days, followed by a 14-day washout period, followed by the alternate diet. Fecal microbiome and metabolome were assessed before and after each diet. HLA-B7 and HLA-B27 transgenic rats with gut inflammation received EEN, CD-TREAT, or standard chow for 4 weeks. Fecal, luminal, and tissue microbiome, fecal metabolites, and gut inflammation were assessed. Five children with active CD activity received CD-TREAT and their clinical activity and calprotectin were evaluated after 8 weeks of treatment.For healthy adults, CD-TREAT was easier to comply with and more acceptable than EEN. CD-TREAT induced similar effects to EEN (EEN vs CD-TREAT) on fecal microbiome composition, metabolome, mean total sulfide (increase 133.0 ± 80.5 vs 54.3 ± 47.0 nmol/g), pH (increase 1.3 ± 0.5 vs 0.9 ± 0.6), and the short-chain fatty acids (μmol/g)  (decrease 27.4 ± 22.6 vs 21.6 ± 20.4), propionate (decrease 5.7 ± 7.8 vs 5.2 ± 7.9), and butyrate (decrease 7.0 ± 7.4 vs 10.2 ± 8.5). In the rat model, CD-TREAT and EEN produced similar changes in bacterial load (decrease 0.3 ± 0.3 log 16S rRNA gene copies per gram), short-chain fatty acids, microbiome, and ileitis severity (mean histopathology score decreases of 1.25 for EEN [P = .015] and 1.0 for CD-TREAT [P = .044] vs chow). In children receiving CD-TREAT, 4 (80%) had a clinical response and 3 (60%) entered remission, with significant concurrent decreases in fecal calprotectin (mean decrease 918 ± 555 mg/kg; P = .002).CD-TREAT replicates EEN changes in the microbiome, decreases gut inflammation, is well tolerated, and is potentially effective in patients with active CD.

In chronic , pretreatment with the high fiber diet attenuated clinical and inflammatory parameters of disease. However, when the treatment with the high fiber diet started after disease had been established, overall protection was minimal. Similarly, delayed treatment with  or B. longum did not provide any protection even when the probiotic was associated with the high fiber diet.Preventive use of a high fiber diet or  clearly protects mice against acute and chronic damage induced by DSS in mice. However, protection is lost when therapies are initiated after disease has been established.

We examined the possibility that these actions are not mutually exclusive and may be mutually reinforcing in ways that enhance long-term of these agents. Daikenchuto, TU-100, is a traditional Japanese medicine containing ginseng. Conversion of the ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1) to bioactive compound K (CK) requires bacterial metabolism. Diet-incorporated TU-100 was administered to mice over a period of several weeks. T-RFLP and 454 pyrosequencing were performed to analyze the time-dependent effects on fecal microbial membership. Fecal microbial capacity to metabolize Rb1 to CK was measured by adding TU-100 or ginseng to stool samples to assess the generation of bioactive metabolites. Levels of metabolized TU-100 components in plasma and in stool samples were measured by LC-MS/MS. Cecal and stool short-chain fatty acids were measured by GC-MS. Dietary administration of TU-100 for 28 days altered the gut microbiota, increasing several bacteria genera including members of Clostridia and Lactococcus lactis. Progressive capacity of microbiota to convert Rb1 to CK was observed over the 28 days administration of dietary TU-100. Concomitantly with these changes, increases in all SCFA were observed in cecal contents and in  and butyrate content of the stool. Chronic consumption of dietary TU-100 promotes changes in gut microbiota enhancing metabolic capacity of TU-100 and increased bioavailability. We believe these findings have broad implications in optimizing the efficacy of natural compounds that depend on microbial bioconversion in general.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29095427>Centrally Determined Standardization of Flow Cytometry Methods Reduces Interlaboratory Variation in a Prospective Multicenter Study.</a></h2><p>Flow cytometry (FC) aids in characterization of cellular and molecular factors involved in pathologic immune responses. Although FC has potential to facilitate early drug development in inflammatory bowel disease, interlaboratory variability limits its use in multicenter trials. Standardization of methods may address this limitation. We compared variability in FC-aided quantitation of T-cell responses across international laboratories using three analytical strategies.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from three healthy donors, stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13- and ionomycin at a central laboratory, fixed, frozen, and shipped to seven international laboratories. Permeabilization and staining was performed in triplicate at each laboratory using a common protocol and centrally provided reagents. Gating was performed using local gating with a local strategy (LGLS), local gating with a central strategy (LGCS), and central gating (CG). Median cell percentages were calculated across triplicates and donors, and reported for each condition and strategy. The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated across laboratories. Between-strategy comparisons were made using a two-way analysis of variance adjusting for donor.Mean interlaboratory CV ranged from 1.8 to 102.1% depending on cell population and gating strategy (LGLS, 4.4-102.1%; LGCS, 10.9-65.6%; CG, 1.8-20.9%). Mean interlaboratory CV differed significantly across strategies and was consistently lower with CG.Central gating was the only strategy with mean CVs consistently lower than 25%, which is a proposed standard for pharmacodynamic and exploratory biomarker assays.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30563420>Hydrogen cross-feeders of the human gastrointestinal tract.</a></h2><p>Hydrogen plays a key role in many microbial metabolic pathways in the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) that have an impact on human nutrition, health and wellbeing. Hydrogen is produced by many members of the GIT microbiota, and may be subsequently utilized by cross-feeding microbes for growth and in the production of larger molecules. Hydrogenotrophic microbes fall into three functional groups: sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogenic archaea and acetogenic bacteria, which can convert hydrogen into hydrogen sulfide, methane and , respectively. Despite different energy yields per molecule of hydrogen used between the functional groups, all three can coexist in the human GIT. The factors affecting the numerical balance of hydrogenotrophs in the GIT remain unconfirmed. There is increasing evidence linking both hydrogen sulfide and methane to GIT diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, and strategies for the mitigation of such health problems through targeting of hydrogenotrophs constitute an important field for further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19907654>Diminished macrophage apoptosis and reactive oxygen species generation after phorbol ester stimulation in Crohn's .</a></h2><p>Crohn's  (CD) is a chronic relapsing disorder characterized by granulomatous inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Although its pathogenesis is complex, we have recently shown that CD patients have a systemic defect in macrophage function, which results in the defective clearance of bacteria from  sites.Here we have identified a number of additional macrophage defects in CD following diacylglycerol (DAG) homolog phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA) activation. We provide evidence for decreased DNA fragmentation, reduced mitochondrial membrane depolarization, impaired reactive oxygen species production, diminished cytochrome c release and increased IL-6 production compared to healthy subjects after PMA exposure. The observed macrophage defects in CD were stimulus-specific, as normal responses were observed following p53 activation and endoplasmic reticulum stress.These findings add to a growing body of evidence highlighting disordered macrophage function in CD and, given their pivotal role in orchestrating  responses, defective apoptosis could potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22079717>Coated chitosan pellets containing rutin intended for the treatment of : in vitro characteristics and in vivo evaluation.</a></h2><p>Preparation of coated pellets intended for rutin colon delivery, their evaluation in vitro and in vivo in experimental colitis in rats was the purpose of this study. Pellets were obtained using extrusion/spheronization and coated with three types of coatings (caffeic acid/hypromellose/alginic acid; sodium alginate/hypromellose/zinc ; sodium alginate/chitosan). Dissolution using buffers of pH values, β-glucosidase and times corresponding to gastrointestinal tract (GIT) was provided. Pellets coated with alginate/chitosan showed low rutin dissolution (12-14%) in upper GIT conditions and fast release (87-89%) under colon conditions; that is a good presumption of intended rutin release. After colitis induction and development, the rats were treated with pellets and rutin solution administered orally, solution also rectally. Colon/body weight ratio, myeloperoxidase activity and histological evaluation were performed. Rutin was able to promote colonic healing at the dose of 10mg/kg: colon/body weight ratio decreased and myeloperoxidase activity was significantly suppressed. Pellets coated with alginate/chitosan applied orally and rutin solution administered rectally showed the best efficacy. The combination of rutin as natural product, mucoadhesive chitosan degraded in the colon and sodium alginate as the main coating substance in the form of pellets create a promising preparation for therapy of this severe illness.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this investigation was to study the importance of locally produced factors and the impact of steroid treatment on neutrophil functions in UC.Intestinal perfusion fluids from 11 patients with active distal UC before and after seven and 28 days of treatment with prednisolone and from seven control patients were used in the study. Neutrophil migration towards perfusion fluid was measured in a microchemotaxis chamber. The effect of perfusion fluids on neutrophil activation was assessed as the surface expression of CD66b by flow cytometry. Neutrophil survival was evaluated by staining with propidium iodide, annexin V, and fluorescein di-. We also assessed the viability of freshly isolated tissue neutrophils from rectal biopsy samples.Perfusion fluids from untreated patients caused increased migration, activation, and survival of neutrophils. Perfusion fluids collected after treatment had no effect on neutrophil migration, but some of the activation and anti-apoptotic effects remained after 7 days. Anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) inhibited the anti-apoptotic effect of perfusion fluids. Rectal tissue neutrophils from patients with active proctitis had increased viability compared to patients with inactive proctitis and control subjects.These data show that mediators in the colon of patients with active UC stimulate the migration, activation, and survival of neutrophils. The activities were partly neutralized by topical steroid treatment.

We also evaluated the relationship between CD4+CD29+T cells and disease severity. UC model was induced by administering DNCB liquid and  solution. We found upregulated expression of CD4+CD29+T cells in both peripheral blood and colon from rats, and a similar trend for MPO and VCAM-1 in colon (P<0.05); the expression was especially enhanced in UC rats at two weeks after the model was established (P<0.01). Such upregulation was also indicated in active and remission UC patients as compared to the healthy and enteritis groups (P<0.05), with the highest expression level detected in the active UC patients (P<0.01). Pearson correlation analysis showed a positive correlation of CD4+CD29+T cells in rat and human peripheral blood with DAI score (rrat=0.712, rhuman=0.677, P<0.01), and MPO in colon (rrat=0.514, rhuman=0.682, P<0.05).

The primary aim of the study was to develop an evidence-based VTE risk stratification tool and definition of immobility for residents in LTC facilities.Using the Delphi process, a panel of vascular thrombotic and geriatric experts reviewed and ranked statements of VTE risk and immobility derived from randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, cohort trials, case-control trials, and case series to arrive at consensus for the importance of each statement. Rating was conducted before and during an on-site meeting following discussion. Statements rated high and very high were used to develop a VTE risk stratification and immobility tool.A total of 1165 publications related to VTE risk were identified from which 137 (12%) pertained to subjects with a median age of 60 years or older; 42 (31%) met study criteria. Eight (29.6%) of 79 publications pertaining to immobility met study criteria. There were 4 studies related to VTE risk and 1 to immobility that were rated as high quality. VTE risk factors were age older than 60 years, active cancer, acute infectious , catheter in a central vein, chronic obstructive pulmonary , dehydration, history of VTE, having a first-degree relative with VTE, heart failure, hypercoagulable state, immobility, , obesity, rheumatoid arthritis and treatment with erythroid stimulating agents to a hemoglobin value greater than 12 g/dL, aromatase inhibitor, hormone replacement therapy, megestrol , or selective estrogen receptor modulators.

Reduction of TNF-α should improve IBD pathology. GM adsorptive apheresis (GMA) is an effective therapy for inflammatory disorders including IBD. GM adsorption to cellulose  (CA) beads induces anti-inflammatory cytokine release, although these effects on TNF-α release are not clarified. We hypothesized that GMA may inhibit TNF-α release. The aim of the present study was to clarify the effects of GM adsorption to CA beads on TNF-α release in vitro. Peripheral blood was incubated with and without CA beads and TNF-α was measured. For comparison, TNF-α was measured in another lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-containing peripheral blood sample incubated similarly. The amount of TNF-α in blood samples incubated with CA beads was significantly higher than in those incubated without beads, although it was significantly lower than TNF-α incubated with LPS-containing sample without beads. The amount of TNF-α after incubation with CA beads positively correlated with GM adsorption ratio. GM adsorption to CA beads induced a small amount of TNF-α release. This is the first report on TNF-α release induced via GM adsorption stimuli. The biological effects of TNF-α release during GM adsorption need to be clarified.© 2014 The Authors.

Our aim was to validate the main contributing factors to this method and compare the effects of different reference drugs upon remission of resultant colon injuries. TNBS was dissolved in 0.25 ml of ethanol (50% v/v) and instilled (25, 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg) intracolonically to the male Wistar rats. After determination of optimum dose of TNBS in male rats and assessment of this dose in female rats, they were treated with reference drugs including dexamethasone [1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.) and 2 mg/kg, orally (p.o.)], Asacol (mesalazine, 100 mg/kg, p.o.; 150 mg/kg, enema) and hydrocortisone  (20 mg/kg, i.p.; 20 mg/kg, enema) which started 2 h after colitis induction and continued daily for 6 consecutive days. Thereafter, macroscopic and microscopic parameters and clinical features were assessed and compared in different groups. We found that the optimum dose of TNBS for the reproducibility of colonic damage with the least mortality rate was 50 mg/kg. Amongst studied reference drugs, hydrocortisone  (i.p.), dexamethasone (i.p. and p.o.) and Asacol (p.o.) significantly diminished the severity of macroscopic and microscopic injuries and could be considered effective for experimental colitis studies in rats . Our findings suggest that optimization of TNBS dose is essential for induction of colitis under the laboratory conditions; and gender exerts no impact upon macroscopic and histological characteristics of TNBS-induced colitis in rats.

The effects of Genistein in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine  via targeting NLRP3 inflammasome was investigated in this study. Also, the mechanisms of protective action of Genistein in DSS-induced  may relate to TGR5 signaling. Genistein treatment not only remarkably attenuated loss of body weight and shortening of colon length but also significantly reduced inflammatory cells infiltration and pro-inflammatory mediator production in serum and colon. Moreover, Genistein treatment down-regulated production of caspase-1 and IL-1β and increased intracellular cAMP level, which were similar to the treatment for INT-777, a semi-synthetic TGR5 agonist, in phorbol myristate  (PMA)-differentiated monocytic THP-1 cells and U937 cells. These protective effects of Genistein might be attributed by ubiquination of NLRP3 which was induced due to interaction of cAMP with NLRP3. Furthermore, the effects of Genistein on NLRP3 inflammasome disappeared in TGR5-silenced U937 cells. In conclusion, our study unveils that Genistein was able to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome via TGR5-cAMP signaling in macrophages. It therefore might be a potential effective drug for inflammatory bowel diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Rosemary aerial parts are used as flavoring agent in foods, beverages, and cosmetic preparations and have various traditional uses in ethnomedicine including: analgesic, anti-, anti-rheumatic, spasmolytic, carminative and choleretic applications. This study was carried out to investigate the effects of rosemary leaves hydroalcoholic extract (RHE) and essential oil (REO) in a well-defined model of experimental colitis induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in rats. Different doses of RHE (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) and REO (100, 200 and 400 μl/kg) were administered orally and intraperitoneally (100, 400 mg/kg and 100, 400 μl/kg) to male Wistar rats (n=6), 6 h after colitis induction and continued for 5 days by intracolonic instillation of 0.25 ml TNBS (80 mg/kg)/ethanol 50% v/v. Wet colon weight/length ratio was measured and tissue damage scores as well as indices of colitis were evaluated both macroscopically and histopathologically. RHE and REO at all test doses used were effective to reduce colon tissue lesions and colitis indices while greater doses were significantly effective to diminish histopathologic parameters irrespective to the route of administration. Administration of oral prednisolone, Asacol(®) (mesalazine microgranules) and parenteral hydrocortisone  were effective to reduce colon tissue injures as well. These data suggest that RHE and REO are both effective to possess anti-colitic activity, and reinforce the use of this plant as a remedy for  in traditional medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15290920>Granulocytapheresis is useful as an alternative therapy in patients with steroid-refractory or -dependent ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p>Recently, granulocyte and monocyte adsorption apheresis (GCAP) has been shown to be safe and effective for active ulcerative colitis (UC). We analyzed the safety and efficacy of GCAP (G-1 Adacolumn) in patients with steroid-refractory and -dependent UC. G-1 Adacolumn is filled with cellulose  carriers that selectively adsorb granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages.Forty-four patients with UC were treated with GCAP. These patients received 5 apheresis sessions over 4 weeks. Twenty patients had steroid-refractory UC (group 1) and 10 had steroid-dependent UC (group 2). Fourteen patients who did not want readministration of steroids were treated with GCAP at the time of relapse, just after discontinuation of steroid therapy (group 3).Of 44 patients treated with GCAP, 24 (55%) obtained remission (CAI < or = 4), 9 (20%) showed a clinical response, and 11 (25%) remained unchanged. Only 2 of 10 patients (20%) with severe steroid-refractory UC (CAI > or = 12) achieved remission, whereas 7 of 10 patients (70%) with moderate steroid-refractory UC achieved remission (p < 0.05). The dose of corticosteroids was tapered in 9 of 10 (90%) patients with steroid-dependent UC after GCAP therapy. Twelve (86%) of 14 patients in group 3 showed an improvement in symptoms and could avoid re-administration of steroids after GCAP. No severe adverse effects occurred.The findings of this study suggest that GCAP may be a useful alternative therapy for patients with moderate steroid-refractory or -dependent UC, although cyclosporin A or colectomy is necessary in patients with severe UC. GCAP may also be useful for avoiding re-administration of steroids at the time of relapse.

Although structure/function relationships between different components of the microbiota are unclear, this complex multicellular entity plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis in the body. Many of the physiologic properties of the microbiota can be attributed to fermentation and the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly , propionate, and butyrate. In healthy people, fermentation processes are largely controlled by the amounts and different types of substrate, particularly complex carbohydrates that are accessible to bacteria in the colonic ecosystem. However, other factors impact on bacterial metabolism in the large gut, including large  transit time, the availability of inorganic terminal electron acceptors, such as nitrate and sulfate, and gut pH. They all affect the types and levels of SCFA that can be formed by the microbiota. This is important because to a large extent, , propionate, and butyrate have varying physiologic effects in different body tissues. Prebiotics such as galactooligosaccharides together with inulins and their fructooligosaccharide derivatives have been shown to modify the species composition of the colonic microbiota, and in various degrees, to manifest several health-promoting properties related to enhanced mineral absorption, laxation, potential anticancer properties, lipid metabolism, and anti- and other immune effects, including atopic . Many of these phenomena can be linked to their digestion and SCFA production by bacteria in the large gut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15102587>Recent developments in the pharmacological treatment of Crohn's .</a></h2><p>Therapy for Crohn's  (CD) is rapidly evolving with the emergence of new discoveries in  pathogenesis.

Phloridzin shows poor absorption and cellular uptake due to its hydrophilic nature. The aim was to investigate and compare the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ester of PZ (PZ-DHA) and its parent compounds (phloridzin and DHA), phloretin (the aglycone of PZ) and cyclooxygenase inhibitory drugs (diclofenac and nimesulide) on production of pro- biomarkers in inflammation-induced macrophages by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulation. Human THP-1 monocytes were seeded in 24-well plates (5×10(5)/well) and treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA, 0.1μg/mL) for 48h to induce macrophage differentiation. After 48h, the differentiated macrophages were washed with Hank's buffer and treated with various concentrations of test compounds for 4h, followed by the LPS-stimulation (18h). Pre-exposure of PZ-DHA ester was more effective in reducing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein levels compared to DHA and nimesulide. However, diclofenac was the most effective in reducing prostaglandin (PGE2) level by depicting a dose-dependent response. However, PZ-DHA ester and DHA were the most effective in inhibiting the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) among other test compounds.

However, its role in the pathogenesis of the  remains uncertain. We studied the effects of IL-15 on colonic mucosal proinflammatory cytokine response in vitro using organ culture of human colonic explants.Colonic tissue was obtained from (1) resections in pediatric CD patients (inflamed and noninflamed) and (2) rectal biopsies in patients with CD undergoing colonoscopy (n = 31) and controls (n = 9). In preliminary experiments, explants from the resections were cultured in the presence or absence of a simulated T(H)1 stimulation using ionomycin (Io) and phorbol-myristate- (PMA), with or without IL-15, or in medium alone. Rectal biopsies were cultured in the same conditions as above, with or without adding a monoclonal anti-IL-15 neutralizing antibody (mAb). Levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-2R alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.IL-15, in the absence of Io + PMA, did not induce the expression of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, or IL-2R alpha. Only inflamed explants from resections stimulated with Io + PMA expressed IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-2R alpha. This T(H)1 stimulatory effect was inhibited by IL-15 in a dose-dependent fashion. In rectal biopsy explants, inflamed, noninflamed CD, and control tissue responded to stimulation with Io + PMA (P < 0.05) with increased IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha (P < 0.05). This response was again inhibited by IL-15. The inhibitory effect of IL-15 was specifically reversed by anti-IL-15 mAb (P < 0.05). The data for the CD group were also analyzed according to the severity of colonic inflammation and medication use.Our results suggest a possible anti- role for IL-15 in CD.

Analysis of fecal samples from untreated amebic liver abscess (ALA) patients, Entamoeba histolytica (Eh)-negative and -positive asymptomatic individuals, and pus samples from naive ALA patients revealed a significant reduction in Lactobacillus in asymptomatic individuals (Eh +ve) and ALA patients. Two anaerobic genera, namely Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus, were detected in naive ALA pus samples. Analysis of fecal samples from amoebic  patients showed a significant decline in population of Bacteroides, Clostridium coccoides and leptum subgroup, Lactobacillus, Campylobacter, and Eubacterium, whereas a significant increase in Bifidobacterium was observed. Mucosa-associated bacterial flora analysis from IBD patients and healthy controls revealed a significant difference in concentration of bacteria among predominating and subdominating genera between ulcerative  (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and controls. In contrast to the mucosal studies, we found a significant increase in lactobacilli population in fecal samples of active UC patients. Another study revealed a significant decrease of Clostridium coccoides and leptum clusters in fecal samples of active UC patients along with decreased concentrations of fecal SCFAs, especially of n-butyrate, iso-butyrate, and .

Further, drug therapy has adverse effects that add to  complications. The current thinking is that disorders like  (IBD) reflect an over exuberant immune activation driven by cytokines including TNF-alpha. Major sources of cytokines include myeloid leukocytes (granulocytes, monocytes/macrophages), which in IBD are elevated with activation behavior and are found in vast numbers within the inflamed intestinal mucosa. Accordingly, myeloid cells should be the targets of therapy. Adacolumn is filled with cellulose  beads that selectively adsorb and deplete myeloid cells and a small fraction of lymphocytes (FcgammaR and complement receptors bearing cells). In one study, 20 steroid naive patients with moderate (n = 14) or severe (n = 6) UC according to Rachmilewitz despite 1.5-2.25 g/day of 5-aminosalicylic acid received 6 to 10 Adacolumn sessions at 2 sessions/week. Efficacy was assessed 1 week after the last session. The majority of patients responded to 6 sessions, 17 (85%) achieved remission. In 2 of the 3 non-responders, CAI was 8 and 12 in 1; all 3 had deep colonic ulcers at study initiation. Decreases were seen in total leukocytes (P = 0.003), % neutrophils (P = 0.003), % monocytes (P = 0.004), an increase in lymphocytes (P = 0.001), decreases in C-reactive protein (P = 0.0002), and rises in blood levels of soluble TNF-alpha receptors I (P = 0.0007), II (P = 0.0045). In a separate study, a case with very severe steroid refractory UC who received up to 11 sessions responded well and avoided colectomy. Further, myeloid cell purging with Adacolumn has been associated with the release of IL-1 receptor antagonist, suppression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, down-modulation of L-selectin and the chemokine receptor CXCR3. In conclusion, selective depletion of myeloid cells appears to induce anti- effects and represents a non-pharmacological treatment for patients with active IBD. The treatment has a clear drug-sparing role. Changes in blood levels of  and anti- factors are thought to contribute to the efficacy of this procedure.Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18824249>Orally administered apple procyanidins protect against experimental  in mice.</a></h2><p>Apple procyanidins (ACT) is a natural biologically active compound extracted from apple.

The control group (n = 5) was administered phosphate buffered saline for 14 days. Acute colitis was induced with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 7 days following administration of phosphate buffered saline for 7 days (DSS-treated group, n = 5). LAB + DSS-treated group (n = 5) was administered lactic acid bacteria (LAB) daily for 7 days followed by treatment with DSS for 7 days to investigate protective effect of LAB against DSS-inducible colitis. Histological damage, myeloperoxidase activity, and malondialdehyde content of colon tissue were reduced, whereas colon length increased in LAB + DSS-treated mice compared to those in DSS-treated mice. DSS treatment was associated with fecal excretion of amino acids, short chain fatty acids, and nucleotides, revealing significant decreases of threonine, alanine, glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, lysine, glycine, butyrate, uracil, and hypoxanthine together with increases of monosaccharides, glucose, and trimethylamine in the feces of mice with DSS-induced colitis. Increased levels of , butyrate, and glutamine and decreased levels of trimethylamine were found in the feces of LAB + DSS-treated mice compared to DSS-treated mice alone.

Suppression of MALT1 protease activity with small molecule inhibitors showed promising efficacies in subtypes of B cell lymphoma and improvement in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model. However, whether MALT1 inhibitors could ameliorate  remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the pharmacological effect of two specific MALT1 inhibitors MI-2 and mepazine on the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental  in mice, followed by mechanistic analysis on NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Treatment with MI-2 and mepazine dose-dependently attenuated symptoms of  in mice, evidenced by reduction in the elevated disease activity index, the shortening of colon length as well as the histopathologic improvement. Moreover, protein and mRNA levels of DSS-induced proinflammatory cytokines in colon, including TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, IL-17A and IFN-γ, were markedly suppressed by MALT1 inhibitors. The underlying mechanisms for the protective effect of MALT1 inhibitors in DSS-induced  may be attributed to its inhibition on NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. The in vitro study showed that MALT1 inhibitors decreased production of IL-1β/IL-18 in phorbol myristate -differentiated THP-1 cells and bone marrow derived macrophage via suppressing the activation of NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome. Taken together, our results demonstrated that inhibition of the protease activity of MALT1 might be a viable strategy to treat inflammatory bowel disease and the NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB activation are critical components in MALT1 signaling cascades in this disease model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28658542>The nutrition-gut microbiome-physiology axis and allergic .</a></h2><p>Dietary and bacterial metabolites influence immune responses. This raises the question whether the increased incidence of allergies, asthma, some autoimmune , cardiovascular , and others might relate to intake of unhealthy foods, and the decreased intake of dietary fiber. In recent years, new knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underpinning a 'diet-gut microbiota-physiology axis' has emerged to substantiate this idea. Fiber is fermented to short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly , butyrate, and propionate. These metabolites bind 'metabolite-sensing' G-protein-coupled receptors such as GPR43, GPR41, and GPR109A. These receptors play fundamental roles in the promotion of gut homeostasis and the regulation of  responses. For instance, these receptors and their metabolites influence Treg biology, epithelial integrity, gut homeostasis, DC biology, and IgA antibody responses. The SCFAs also influence gene transcription in many cells and tissues, through their inhibition of histone deacetylase expression or function. Contained in this mix is the gut microbiome, as commensal bacteria in the gut have the necessary enzymes to digest dietary fiber to SCFAs, and dysbiosis in the gut may affect the production of SCFAs and their distribution to tissues throughout the body. SCFAs can epigenetically modify DNA, and so may be one mechanism to account for  with a 'developmental origin', whereby in utero or post-natal exposure to environmental factors (such as nutrition of the mother) may account for  later in life. If the nutrition-gut microbiome-physiology axis does underpin at least some of the Western lifestyle influence on asthma and allergies, then there is tremendous scope to correct this with healthy foodstuffs, probiotics, and prebiotics.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Both disorders are worsened during stress, and in laboratory mice, stress exposure has been shown to change the composition of the gut microbiome. Stress-induced changes to the microbiome exacerbate intestinal inflammation and alter intestinal motility in mice. It is, however, not yet known whether microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate, and ) and their receptors contribute to this effect.Mice were exposed to a social disruption stress, or left undisturbed as a control. After the first stress exposure, mice were orally challenged with Citrobacter rodentium or with vehicle. The levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. SCFA receptors were measured via real-time polymerase chain reaction. Microbial community composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.Stress exposure reduced colonic SCFA levels. Stress exposure and C rodentium, however, significantly increased SCFA levels and changed the expression of SCFA receptors. The levels of SCFAs did not correlate with the severity of colonic inflammation, but the colonic expression of the SCFA receptor GPR41 was positively associated with  cytokines and colonic histopathology scores. The relative abundances of several taxa of colonic bacteria were significantly changed by stress exposure, including SCFA producers.Social stress can have a significant effect on infection-induced colonic inflammation, and stress-induced changes in microbial-produced metabolites and their receptors may be involved.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21884473>Evaluation of the effect of ulinastatin on the production of macrophage colony-stimulating factor in vitro for potential combination therapy with leukocyte adsorption.</a></h2><p>Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) induces normal intestinal macrophages that have anti- effects. Thus, M-CSF-rich conditions in colonic tissues seem to contribute to the improvement of pathological conditions in patients with  (IBD). However, it has not been clarified whether current therapies for IBD, including granulocyte/monocyte adsorptive apheresis using an Adacolumn, and ulinastatin, a serine protease inhibitor, affect the production of M-CSF. To clarify the effects of these therapies on M-CSF production, we investigated whether monocyte adsorption to cellulose  (CA) beads (carriers for Adacolumn therapy) and ulinastatin augmented M-CSF production in in vitro experiments. Peripheral blood was incubated with and without CA beads, and then M-CSF production was measured. Additionally, peripheral blood containing serial dilutions of ulinastatin was incubated with CA beads followed by measurement of M-CSF production. Monocyte adsorption to CA beads did not affect M-CSF production. A high concentration of ulinastatin augmented M-CSF production without inhibiting monocyte adsorption to CA beads, although a low concentration of ulinastatin conversely suppressed M-CSF production. The present study found that a high concentration of ulinastatin, which was administrated with CA beads, increased the production of M-CSF. Our results suggest that a combination of ulinastatin and Adacolumn therapy may provide more clinical efficacy for the treatment of IBD in terms of the production of M-CSF.© 2011 The Authors.

The idea was to minimize undesired drug release in the upper gastrointestinal tract and to control CIN-102 release in the colon, in order to optimize the resulting antibiotic concentration at the site of action. A particular challenge was the fact that CIN-102 is a volatile hydrophobic liquid.

The resulting transgenic animals had normal numbers of MCs in their tissues that histochemically and morphologically resembled those in WT C57BL/6 mice. MCs could also be generated from RasGRP4-null mice by culturing their bone marrow cells in IL-3-enriched conditioned medium. Despite these data, the levels of the transcripts that encode the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α were reduced in phorbol 12-myristate 13--treated MCs developed from RasGRP4-null mice. Although inflammation was not diminished in a Dermatophagoides farinae-dependent model of allergic airway , dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis was significantly reduced in RasGRP4-null mice relative to similarly treated WT mice. Furthermore, experimental arthritis could not be induced in RasGRP4-null mice that had received K/BxN mouse serum. The latter findings raise the possibility that the pharmacologic inactivation of this intracellular signaling protein might be an effective treatment for arthritis or .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22308682>[Preparation of paeonol-beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complex loaded colon specific delivery tablets].</a></h2><p>To prepare paeonol-beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complex (Pae-beta-CYD) loaded colon-specific release tablets.The core tablets were prepared with the mixture of Pae-beta-CYD inclusion complex, peotin and calcium , and coated with ethanolic solution of Eudragit S100.

The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to explore the characterization of SCFAs in IBD patients and their potential role in the occurrence and development of IBD.Case-control studies investigating SCFAs in IBD patients were identified from several English databases. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the random-effects model.The SMDs of , valerate, and total SCFAs in ulcerative  (UC) patients were -0.51 (95% CI, -0.90 to -0.13), -0.65 (95% CI, -1.02 to -0.28), and -0.51 (95% CI, -0.95 to -0.07), respectively. The SMDs of , propionate, and butyrate in patients with active UC were -1.74 (95% CI, -3.15 to -0.33), -2.42 (95% CI, -4.24 to -0.60), and -1.99 (95% CI, -3.39 to -0.60), respectively. However, the SMD of butyrate in UC patients in remission was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.34 to 1.11).

The study aimed to explore the therapeutic effect of maqui berry on inflammatory bowel disease. Maqui berry water extract was separated by multiple solvents extraction. The chemical bases, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of different extract fractions were then compared. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced ulcerative  mice were used for the pharmacological activity test in vivo. Experimental results showed that the ethyl  fraction of maqui berry water extract (MWE) was rich in phenols and exhibited good antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. MWE considerably reduced the expression of COX2 and IL-6 in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Inflammatory bowel disease index, MDA, NO, i-NOS, and COX2 in colon tissues and MPO, TNF-α, and IL-1β in blood serums were remarkably decreased in the treatment group compared to in the model group (p < 0.05). Intestinal histopathological damage was significantly alleviated in the treatment group, and the expression of occludin was increased (p < 0.05). MWE treatment alleviated the imbalance of gut microbiota caused by DSS injury. Overall, MWE plays a therapeutic role in ulcerative  through its anti-inflammatory effect, reduces immune stress, and regulates gut microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23801832>Fluctuations in butyrate-producing bacteria in ulcerative colitis patients of North India.</a></h2><p>To study the interplay between butyrate concentration and butyrate-producing bacteria in fecal samples of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients vs control individuals.Fecal samples were collected from 14 control individuals (hemorrhoid patients only) and 26 UC patients (severe: n = 12, moderate: n = 6, remission: n = 8), recruited by the gastroenterologist at the Department of Gastroenterology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.  activity in UC patients was determined by clinical colitis activity index. We employed fluorescent in situ hybridization in combination with flow cytometry to enumerate the clostridium cluster population targeted by 16S rRNA gene probe. Major butyrate-producing species within this cluster were quantified to see if any change existed in control vs UC patients with different  activity. This observed change was further validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition to this, we carried out gas chromatography to evaluate the changes in concentration of major short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), namely , n-butyrate, iso-butyrate, in the above samples. Student t test and Graph pad prism-6 were used to compare the data statistically.There was a significant decrease of Clostridium coccoides (control, 25.69% ± 1.62% vs severe, 9.8% ± 2.4%, P = 0.0001) and Clostridium leptum clusters (control, 13.74% ± 1.05% vs severe, 6.2% ± 1.8%, P = 0.0001) in fecal samples of UC patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated that some butyrate-producing members of the clostridial cluster, like Fecalibacterium prausnitzii (control, 11.66% ± 1.55% vs severe, 6.01% ± 1.6%, P = 0.0001) and Roseburia intestinalis (control, 14.48% ± 1.52% vs severe, 9% ± 1.83%, P = 0.02) were differentially present in patients with different  activity. In addition, we also demonstrated decreased concentrations of fecal SCFAs, especially of n-butyrate (control, 24.32 ± 1.86 mmol/μL vs severe, 12.74 ± 2.75 mmol/μL, P = 0.003), iso-butyrate (control, 1.70 ± 0.41 mmol/μL vs severe, 0.68 ± 0.24 mmol/μL, P = 0.0441) and  (control, 39.51 ± 1.76 mmol/μL vs severe, 32.12 ± 2.95 mmol/μL, P = 0.047), in the fecal samples of UC patients. The observed decrease of predominant butyrate producers of clostridial clusters correlated with the reduced SCFA levels in active UC patients. This was further confirmed by the restoration in the population of some butyrate producers with simultaneous increase in the level of SCFA in remission samples.Our observations indicate that decreases in members of the clostridial cluster resulting in reduced butyrate levels contribute to the etiology of UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26220166>CD161(int)CD8+ T cells: a novel population of highly functional, memory CD8+ T cells enriched within the gut.</a></h2><p>The C-type lectin-like receptor CD161 is expressed by lymphocytes found in human gut and liver, as well as blood, especially natural killer (NK) cells, T helper 17 (Th17) cells, and a population of unconventional T cells known as mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. The association of high CD161 expression with innate T-cell populations including MAIT cells is established. Here we show that CD161 is also expressed, at intermediate levels, on a prominent subset of polyclonal CD8+ T cells, including antiviral populations that display a memory phenotype. These memory CD161(int)CD8+ T cells are enriched within the colon and express both CD103 and CD69, markers associated with tissue residence. Furthermore, this population was characterized by enhanced polyfunctionality, increased levels of cytotoxic mediators, and high expression of the transcription factors T-bet and eomesodermin (EOMES). Such populations were induced by novel vaccine strategies based on adenoviral vectors, currently in trial against hepatitis C virus. Thus, intermediate CD161 expression marks potent polyclonal, polyfunctional tissue-homing CD8+ T-cell populations in humans. As induction of such responses represents a major aim of T-cell prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines in viral disease and cancer, analysis of these populations could be of value in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22969694>Selective Granulocyte and Monocyte Apheresis as a Non-Pharmacological Option for Patients with .</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's  are the two most prevalent . In both cases, the medically refractory and steroid-dependent type presents a therapeutic challenge. To help resolve this problem, a mainly Japanese team developed a new therapeutic option. There are two systems, both of which are able to selectively remove the main mediators of the , namely the activated pro- cytokine-producing granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages, from the patient's blood circulation (GMA = granulocyte monocyte apheresis). One of the two systems is the Adacolumn( (®) ) (Immunoresearch Laboratories, Takasaki, Japan) consisting of the ADA-monitor and a single-use column, which contains approximately 35,000 cellulose  beads. The exact mode of action is not yet sufficiently understood, but however, a modulation of the immune system takes place. As a result, less pro- cytokines are released. Furthermore, the production of anti- interleukin-1 receptor antagonist is increased, and the apoptosis of granulocytes boosted. The decreased LECAM-1-expression on leukocytes impedes the leukotaxis to the inflamed tissue, and CD10-negative immature granulocytes appear in the peripheral blood. Another effect to be mentioned is the removal of the peripheral dendritic cells and the leachate of regulatory T cells (T-regs). The second system is the Cellsorba( (®) ) FX Filter (Asahi Medical, Tokyo, Japan). The range of efficiency, the indication, and the procedure are very similar to the Adacolumn. Solely the additional removal of lymphocytes can possibly limit the implementation since lymphopenia can increase the risk of autoimmune . Both systems provide a low-risk therapy with few adverse reactions. ASFA recommendations for GMA in  are 2B due to the fact that not enough randomized double-blind studies are available to proof the efficacy of this treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25179909>Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum, a butyrate producer with probiotic potential, is intrinsically tolerant to stomach and small intestine conditions.</a></h2><p>Butyrate has several beneficial properties that are essential to maintain gastrointestinal health. Therefore butyrate-producing bacteria are seen as the next generation of probiotics. The butyrate-producing bacterium Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum (a clostridial cluster IV strain) is such a promising probiotic candidate for people suffering from inflammatory bowel disease. To exert its beneficial properties, it is crucial that B. pullicaecorum survives the harsh conditions of the upper gastrointestinal tract to arrive in the colon in a viable and metabolically active state. Before developing a stable formulation of B. pullicaecorum for oral administration, it is important to know its intrinsic acid and bile tolerance. We monitored the survival during and short chain fatty acid production after incubation in conditions simulating the stomach and small intestine using in vitro batch experiments. In case of acid conditions (pH 2 and pH 3), B. pullicaecorum was viable and active but not cultivable. Cultivability was restored during subsequent small intestine conditions. Importantly, bile and pancreatic juice had no lethal effect. Milk, as a suspension medium, only had a protective effect on the cultivability during the first hour at pH 2. B. pullicaecorum was still metabolically active after upper gastrointestinal conditions and produced short chain fatty acids, but a shift from butyrate to  production was observed. Although the butyrate-producing anaerobe B. pullicaecorum showed good intrinsic acid and bile tolerance in terms of viability and metabolic activity, colonization efficiency and butyrate production under colon conditions is needed to further evaluate its probiotic potential.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, data are scarce about the mechanism of action and its efficacy in ulcerative colitis (UC).To assess intracellular changes of the colonic mucosa in patients with UC before and after infliximab treatment.7 patients (18-65 years, 4 men) with active, refractory, moderate to severe UC (Lichtiger's Clinical Activity Index > 6, Endoscopic Index > 4) underwent colonoscopy before and 4 weeks after the initial infusion of infliximab 5mg/kg of body weight. Endoscopically obtained biopsy specimens were processed specifically, stained with uranyl- and lead citrate and examined with a JEOL-1010 transmission electron microscope.Before treatment we noticed severe alterations of the epithelium: microvilli depletion, shattering of the epithelial junctions, cytoplasmic vacuolization, dilatation of the endoplasmic reticulum, pycnotic nuclei, altered structure of mitochondria and Golgi complexes. Rarefaction of the goblet cells, and abnormal mucus formation and secretion were also observed. The corresponding chorion showed structural alteration of component cells, obstructed capillaries, erythrocyte extravasation, and many plasmocytes and neutrophils. After infliximab, improvement in morphology and function of the epithelial organelles, rich mucus secretion and recovery of the chorionic components were noticed.Our study revealed important intracellular alterations of the UC mucosa that were restored after infliximab therapy.

It remains to be elucidated how the associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TNFSF15 affect the susceptibility to CD. Because there are no non-synonymous SNPs in TNFSF15, we speculated that one or more of the SNPs associated with CD may act as cis-regulatory SNPs. To reveal the effects of the SNPs on the transcriptional activity of TNFSF15, we first examined the allelic expression imbalance of TNFSF15 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). When PBMCs stimulated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) were examined, the allelic ratio of mRNA transcribed from the risk haplotype to the non-risk haplotype increased, compared with the ratio without stimulation. When peripheral blood T cells and Jurkat cells stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13- + ionomycin were examined, an allelic expression imbalance similar to that observed in PBMCs stimulated by PHA was confirmed. The promoter assay in stimulated Jurkat cells showed that the luciferase activity of the promoter region (-979 to +35) of the risk haplotype was significantly higher than that of the non-risk haplotype, and deletion and mutagenesis analysis demonstrated that this difference resulted from the -358T/C SNP. The promoter activity of -358C (risk allele) was higher than that of -358T (non-risk allele) in stimulated T cells. This effect of -358T/C on the transcriptional activity in stimulated T cells may confer susceptibility to CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23914191>Dietary inhibitors of histone deacetylases in intestinal immunity and homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are integral players in homeostasis of immunity and host defense in the gut and are under influence of the intestinal microbiome. Microbial metabolites and dietary components, including short chain fatty acids (, propionate, and butyrate, SCFAs), have an impact on the physiology of IECs at multiple levels, including the inhibition of deacetylases affecting chromatin remodeling and global changes in transcriptional activity. The number and diversity of butyrate-producing bacteria is subject to factors related to age, , and to diet. At physiological levels, SCFAs are inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACs) which may explain the transcriptional effects of SCFAs on epithelial cells, although many effects of SCFAs on colonic mucosa can be ascribed to mechanisms beyond HDAC inhibition. Interference with this type of post-translational modification has great potential in cancer and different  , because HDAC inhibition has anti-proliferative and anti- effects in vitro, and in in vivo models of intestinal inflammation. Hence, the influence of dietary modulators on HDAC activity in epithelia is likely to be an important determinant of its responses to  and microbial challenges.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30376571>Suboptimal community growth mediated through metabolite crossfeeding promotes species diversity in the gut microbiota.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota represent a highly complex ecosystem comprised of approximately 1000 species that forms a mutualistic relationship with the human host. A critical attribute of the microbiota is high species diversity, which provides system robustness through overlapping and redundant metabolic capabilities. The gradual loss of bacterial diversity has been associated with a broad array of gut pathologies and diseases including malnutrition, obesity, diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease. We formulated an in silico community model of the gut microbiota by combining genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of 28 representative species to explore the relationship between species diversity and community growth. While the individual species offered a broad range of metabolic capabilities, communities optimized for maximal growth on simulated Western and high-fiber diets had low diversities and imbalances in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis characterized by  overproduction. Community flux variability analysis performed with the 28-species model and a reduced 20-species model suggested that enhanced species diversity and more balanced SCFA production were achievable at suboptimal growth rates. We developed a simple method for constraining species abundances to sample the growth-diversity tradeoff and used the 20-species model to show that tradeoff curves for Western and high-fiber diets resembled Pareto-optimal surfaces. Compared to maximal growth solutions, suboptimal growth solutions were characterized by higher species diversity, more balanced SCFA synthesis and lower exchange rates of crossfed metabolites between more species. We hypothesized that modulation of crossfeeding relationships through host-microbiota interactions could be an important means for maintaining species diversity and suggest that community metabolic modeling approaches that allow multiobjective optimization of growth and diversity are needed for more realistic simulation of complex communities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21075970>Companion animals symposium: microbes and gastrointestinal health of dogs and cats.</a></h2><p>Recent molecular studies have revealed complex bacterial, fungal, archaeal, and viral communities in the gastrointestinal tract of dogs and cats. More than 10 bacterial phyla have been identified, with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria constituting more than 99% of all gut microbiota. Microbes act as a defending barrier against invading pathogens, aid in digestion, provide nutritional support for enterocytes, and play a crucial role in the development of the immune system. Of significance for gastrointestinal health is their ability to ferment dietary substrates into short-chain fatty acids, predominantly to , propionate, and butyrate. However, microbes can have also a detrimental effect on host health. Specific pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, and enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens) have been implicated in acute and chronic gastrointestinal . Compositional changes in the small intestinal microbiota, potentially leading to changes in intestinal permeability and digestive function, have been suggested in canine small intestinal dysbiosis or antibiotic-responsive diarrhea. There is mounting evidence that microbes play an important role in the pathogenesis of canine and feline  (IBD). Current theories for the development of IBD favor a combination of environmental factors, the intestinal microbiota, and a genetic susceptibility of the host. Recent studies have revealed a genetic susceptibility for defective bacterial clearance in Boxer dogs with granulomatous colitis. Differential expression of pathogen recognition receptors (i.e., Toll-like receptors) were identified in dogs with chronic enteropathies. Similarly to humans, a microbial dysbiosis has been identified in feline and canine IBD. Commonly observed microbial changes are increased Proteobacteria (i.e., Escherichia coli) with concurrent decreases in Firmicutes, especially a reduced diversity in Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV (i.e., Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Faecalibacterium spp.). This would indicate that these bacterial groups, important short-chain fatty acid producers, may play an important role in promoting intestinal health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27117102>DNA damage and apoptosis in blood neutrophils of inflammatory bowel disease patients and in Caco-2 cells in vitro exposed to betanin.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and continuing colonic inflammation is considered an important risk factor in the development of colorectal cancer. Our previous studies showed that beetroot (Beta vulgaris var. rubra) products and their major component betanin modulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13- (TPA) stimulated human polymorphonuclear neutrophils of healthy volunteers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of betanin on the oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis in neutrophils isolated from blood of patients with inflammatory bowel disease--ulcerative  (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The results were compared with those obtained in colon carcinoma-derived Caco-2 cells. Betanin treatment at the concentration of 100 μM for 24 h increased DNA damage assessed by comet assay in IBD patients' neutrophils. A similar effect although less pronounced was observed in Caco-2 cells. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with H2O2 caused a 4-fold increase of DNA strand breaks in comparison to untreated cells, but pre-treatment with betanin reduced DNA damage in these cells. Betanin also induced procaspase-3 cleavage and caspase-3 activity accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, indicating its pro-apoptotic activity. These results suggest that betanin may support mechanisms that lead to the release of ROS and apoptotic cell death. In this way betanin may exert anti-inflammatory and potentially cancer preventive activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23198878>Murine CD4⁺CD25⁻ cells activated in vitro with PMA/ionomycin and anti-CD3 acquire regulatory function and ameliorate experimental colitis in vivo.</a></h2><p>Induced regulatory T (iTreg) lymphocytes show promise for application in the treatment of allergic, autoimmune and  disorders. iTreg cells demonstrate advantages over natural Treg (nTreg) cells in terms of increased number of starting population and greater potential to proliferate.

We previously showed that intestinal expression of the transcriptional coregulator tetradecanoyl phorbol -induced sequence 7 (tis7) is markedly increased during the adaptive response following massive small bowel resection and tis7 plays a role in normal gut lipid metabolism. Here, we further explore the functional implications of tis7 deletion in intestinal lipid metabolism and the adaptive response following small bowel resection. Intestinal tis7 transgenic (tis7(tg)), tis7(-/-), and wild-type (WT) littermates were subjected to 50% small bowel resection. Mice were fed a control or a high-saturated-fat (42% energy) diet for 21 days. Survival, body weight recovery, lipid absorption, mucosal lipid analysis, and the morphometric adaptive response were analyzed. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to identify tis7 downstream gene targets. Postresection survival was markedly reduced in high-fat, but not control, diet-fed tis7(-/-) mice. Decreased survival was associated with anastomotic inflammation and intestinal obstruction postresection. High-fat, but not control, diet-fed tis7(-/-) mice had increased intestinal IL-6 expression. Intestinal lipid trafficking was altered in tis7(-/-) compared with WT mice postresection. In contrast, high-fat diet-fed tis7(tg) mice had improved survival postresection compared with WT littermates. High-fat diet feeding in the setting of tis7 deletion resulted in postresection anastomotic inflammation and small bowel obstruction. Tolerance of a calorie-rich, high-fat diet postresection may require tis7 and its target genes. The presence of luminal fat in the setting of tis7 deletion promotes an intestinal inflammatory response postresection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18614971>Combined butyric acid/mesalazine treatment in ulcerative colitis with mild-moderate activity.

However, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of wogonoside has not been fully elucidated. Recently, NLRP3 inflammasome has been reported to be correlated with inflammatory bowel disease for its ability to induce IL-1β release. Nevertheless, there are few drug candidates targeting NLRP3 inflammasome for this disease. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of wogonoside in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine  and further revealed the underlying mechanisms by targeting NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome. Wogonoside treatment dose-dependently attenuated DSS-induced body weight loss and colon length shortening. Moreover, wogonoside prevented DSS-induced colonic pathological damage, remarkably inhibited inflammatory cells infiltration and significantly decreased myeloperoxidase (MPO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activities. The production of pro-inflammatory mediators in serum and colon was also significantly reduced by wogonoside. The underlying mechanisms for the protective effect of wogonoside in DSS-induced  may be attributed to its inhibition on NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in colons. Furthermore, wogonoside markedly decreased production of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 and suppressed mRNA expression of pro-IL-1β and NLRP3 in phorbol myristate  (PMA)-differentiated monocytic THP-1 cells via inhibiting the activation of NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that wogonoside may exert its anti-inflammatory effect via dual inhibition of NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome, suggesting that wogonoside might be a potential effective drug for inflammatory bowel diseases.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) 17 is a key enzyme for the shedding of not only the type 1 membrane-anchored protein, amphiregulin, but also the type 2 protein, TNF-α. However, the detailed mechanism by which ADAM17 cleaves type 1 and 2 membrane-anchored proteins is unclear. Annexin (ANX) A2 is involved in ADAM17-mediated amphiregulin shedding. In this study, we examined whether ANX A2 is involved in TNF-α shedding.We prepared U937, HT29, and HCT116 cells overexpressing alkaline phosphatase (AP)-tagged proTNF-α and depleted ADAM17 and ANX A2. We assessed TNF-α release and shedding by measuring the TNF-α release concentration and AP activities in conditioned media after interleukin-1β or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA) stimulation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and AP assay, respectively. A direct association of ANX A2 with ADAM17 was examined with immunoprecipitation and Western blotting.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and AP assay showed interleukin-1β-induced TNF-α shedding in HCT116 and HT29 cells and TPA-induced TNF-α release in U937 cells. KB-R7785 and ADAM17 depletion significantly blocked TNF-α shedding by TPA. ANX A2 depletion significantly inhibited TNF-α shedding by interleukin-1β and TPA. In contrast, ANX A2 depletion did not abrogate ADAM17-mediated amphiregulin and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor shedding. ANX A2 was directly associated with ADAM17.ANX A2 was closely associated with ADAM17 and played an important role in TNF-α shedding by TPA. Inhibition of ANX A2 might be a new therapeutic strategy for prevention of TNF-α shedding during  inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24193156>Beneficial effects of an amino acid mixture on colonic mucosal healing in rats.</a></h2><p>Mucosal healing (MH) decreases the relapse risk in patients with , but the role of dietary supplementation in this process has been poorly investigated. Here, we investigated the effect of an amino acid mixture supplement on rat MH.Colitis was induced using 5% of dextran sodium sulfate for 6 days. Then, rats received a mixture of threonine (0.50 g/d), methionine (0.31 g/d), and monosodium glutamate (0.57 g/d) or an isonitrogenous amount of alanine (control group). Colons were recovered after colitis induction and after dietary supplementation for measuring colon characteristics, myeloperoxidase, cytokine gene expression, glutathione content, protein synthesis rate, and for histological analysis. Short-chain fatty acids were measured in the colonic content.Colitis induction resulted in anorexia, thickening and shortening of the colon, and ulceration. Colonic cytokine expression and neutrophil infiltration were increased. An increased amount of water and a decreased amount of butyrate, propionate, and  were measured in the colonic content. Supplementation with the amino acid mixture coincided with a reduced protein synthesis rate in the colon compatible with the observed increased colonic MH. Mucosal regeneration/re-epithelialization was visible within 3 days after colitis induction at a time when mucosal inflammation was severe. Histological analysis revealed an increased regeneration/re-epithelialization after 10-day supplementation. In contrast, the spontaneous resolution of inflammation was not affected by the supplementation.Amino acid supplementation ameliorates colonic MH but not mucosal  status. Our data sustain the use of adjuvant dietary intervention on initiated intestinal MH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27309769>Protective effect of Periplaneta americana extract in ulcerative  rats induced by dinitrochlorobenzene and acetic acid.</a></h2><p>Periplaneta americana L. (Dictyoptera; Blattaria) has been traditional used to treat ulcers, burns and heart disease in southwestern China. Recent reports indicate that P. americana can be used as an alternative medicine in therapy of ulcerative , but the mechanism involved remains obscure.This study investigated the therapeutic effect of P. americana extract (PAE) in rat  and elucidated its potential mechanism.Dinitrochlorobenzene and acetic acid-induced  rat model was applied.  rats were treated with PAE for 10 d and estimated disease activity index daily. Rectal inflammation was assessed by myeloperoxidase activity and histological changes. Another  rats were treated with PAE for 4 d, meanwhile gavage with Escherichia coli labelled with green fluorescent protein. Mesenteric lymph nodes, colon, liver, spleen and kidney were harvested for bacteria culture. PAE was suspended in distilled water then partitioned with ethyl  and n-butanol to obtain ethyl  fraction, n-butanol fraction and water fraction, respectively. Fibroblasts proliferation and collagen accumulation of each fraction was determined.PAE treatment reduced the severity of  and tissue myeloperoxidase accumulation (p < 0.001). Also, PAE at 80 mg/kg significantly inhibited labelled E. coli from translocating to distant organs, especially to MLN and liver. Additionally, PAE significantly stimulated fibroblasts proliferation (126.9%) and collagen accumulation (130.8%) for 48 h incubation. Among the partitions, ethyl  fraction generally had higher fibroblast viability enhanced-activity.PAE can protect against ulcerative  and this protection is attributed to anti-inflammation and fibroblasts viability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211831>Intestinal Inflammation Modulates the Epithelial Response to Butyrate in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Butyrate-producing gut bacteria are reduced in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), supporting the hypothesis that butyrate supplementation may be beneficial in this setting. Nonetheless, earlier studies suggest that the oxidation of butyrate in IBD patients is altered. We propose that inflammation may decrease epithelial butyrate consumption.Non-IBD controls and IBD patients were recruited for the study. Stool samples were used for short-chain fatty acid and bacterial butyryl CoA: CoA-transferase quantification. Colonic biopsies and ex vivo differentiated epithelial organoids (d-EpOCs) treated with butyrate and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) were used for analyzing the expression of transporters MCT1 and ABCG2, metabolic enzyme ACADS, and butyrate receptor GPR43, and for butyrate metabolism and consumption assays.We observed that lower stool content of butyrate-producing bacteria in active IBD patients did not correlate with decreased butyrate concentrations. Indeed, the intestinal epithelial expression of MCT1, ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 was altered in active IBD patients. Nonetheless, d-EpOCs derived from IBD patients showed SLC16A1 (gene encoding for MCT1 protein), ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 expression levels comparable to controls. Moreover, IBD- and non-IBD-derived d-EpOCs responded similarly to butyrate, as assessed by transcriptional regulation. TNFα significantly altered SLC16A1, ABCG2, and GPR43 transcription in d-EpOCs, mimicking the expression profile observed in biopsies from active IBD patients and resulting in reduced butyrate consumption.We provide evidence that the response to butyrate is not intrinsically altered in IBD patients. However, TNFα renders the epithelium less responsive to this metabolite, defeating the purpose of butyrate supplementation during active inflammation.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

Copaxone suppresses the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, a key mediator of inflammation in MS as well as in other pathologies, such as colitis of interstitial   (IBD). Copaxone is a drug approved for the treatment of MS, and one that is very well tolerated with a high safety profile and relatively few side effects. Crohn's  has not been associated with its administration.We describe a patient with MS in remission who had not exhibited any signs of IBD in the past. She had been on Copaxone 20 mg/day treatment for 2 years when she first exhibited gastrointestinal symptoms.Our patient developed Crohn's  while on Copaxone treatment as a consequence of long-term immunosuppression.Clinicians should be aware that Crohn's  is a potential novel adverse drug effect of Copaxone.Copyright 2008 S.

Taxonomic profiling was performed by aligning the reeds, not maped on hg19, on MetaPhlAn2 reference database. Reeds were mapped using the HUNAnN2 algorithm to the ChocoPhlAn database to assess the representation of microbial metabolic pathways. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) level were measured in fecal samples by gas-liquid chromatographic analysis.Changes in IBD patients gut microbiota were characterized by an increase in the representation of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla bacteria and decrease in the number of Firmicutes phylum bacteria and Euryarchaeota phylum archaea; a decrease in the alpha-diversity index, relative representation of butyrate-producing, hydrogen-utilizing bacteria, and Methanobrevibacter smithii; increase in the relative representation of Ruminococcus gnavus in UC and CD patients and Akkermansia muciniphila in CD patients. Reduction of Butyryl-CoA:  CoA transferase gene relative representation in CD patients, decrease of absolute content of SCFA total number as well as particular SCFAs and main SCFAs ratio in IBD patients may indicate inhibition of functional activity and number of anaerobic microflora and/or an change in SCFA utilization by colonocytes.the revealed changes can be considered as typical signs of dysbiosis in IBD patients and can be used as potential targets for IBD patients personalized treatment development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23416292>Simultaneous quantification of 22R and 22S epimers of budesonide in human plasma by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry: application in a stereoselective pharmacokinetic study.</a></h2><p>Budesonide (BUD) is used as a mixture of 22R and 22S epimers for the topical treatment of asthma, rhinitis, and . To study stereoselectivity in the pharmacokinetics of each epimer, we developed a stereoselective and sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the quantitative determination of 22R and 22S epimers of BUD in human plasma. The epimers of BUD were extracted from plasma using n-hexane/dichloromethane/isopropanol (2:1:0.1, v/v/v) under alkaline conditions. Baseline separation was obtained within 7min on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 (50mm×2.1mm, 1.7μm) column using an isocratic mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile/5mM ammonium /acetic acid (29:71:0.142, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.7mL/min. Mass spectrometric detection was performed in a multiple reaction monitoring mode using the m/z 489→357 transition for BUD epimers and the m/z 497→357 transition for the internal standard d8-BUD epimers. Calibration curves were linear over the concentration ranges of 5.0-500 and 5.0-3000pg/mL for 22R-BUD and 22S-BUD, respectively. The lower limit of quantification was 5.0pg/mL for both epimers. The method was successfully applied in a pharmacokinetic study of BUD controlled-release capsules in humans. Consistent differences in the pharmacokinetics of the 22R and 22S epimers were observed, the AUC(0-∞) of 22S-BUD was approximately six times higher than that of 22R-BUD, and the 22S-/22R-BUD ratio of total body clearance was 0.17.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, to date, this parameter has not been assessed in a comparative study of patients in prolonged remission and those with the active . We report here our study of lipid peroxidation, antioxidant and inflammation status in serum derived from 16 active CD patients, 27 clinically stable patients, and 15 healthy controls. Results The extent of lipid peroxidation was higher in CD patients than in the healthy controls, while the levels of lipid peroxides (PD) and of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were significantly (P < 0.01) higher in serum obtained from patients with active CD (22 and 30%, respectively) than in that obtained from patients in remission. An analysis of the antioxidant status revealed that the beta-carotene levels in sera derived from all CD patients - patients with active or stable CD (49.4 +/- 15 and 95.6 +/- 25 mg% beta-carotene, respectively) - were higher than that in the controls (145 +/- 40 mg%). Serum activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was significantly (P < 0.001) higher (by 31%) in the patients with active CD than in the control group. There was no significant difference in GSH-Px activity between patients in remission and the controls. In terms of the  status, we found significantly (P < 0.01) higher levels of C-reactive proteins (CRP) and of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) in patients with active CD than in CD patients in remission. There was a significant correlation between those parameters and the extent of lipid oxidation. Neutrophils, which are a potential source of oxygen-free radicals, were activated by incubation with phorbol myristate  (PMA). Superoxide and lysozyme release were significantly reduced in neutrophils derived from patients with active CD (by 25 and 28%, respectively) in comparison to the control group. However, stimulated neutrophils from stable patients demonstrated only a minimally non-significant lower release of superoxide and lysozyme compared to the controls. Conclusion The results obtained in this study demonstrate an enhanced  and oxidative stress and a decreased antioxidant status in patients with active CD. As the patients improved and became clinically stable, the oxidative parameters decreased, approaching normal values. As neutrophil activation was also lower in patients with active , neutrophil activation may represent a possible defense mechanism of the body against tissue injury.</p></html>
