Although the exact role of syndecan still remains unclear, HS/syndecan-1 is thought to have some important role in the CaOx crystal formation. Mardin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells are most commonly used in kidney stone research. It was reported that MDCK cells do not express syndecan-1. In the present study, we established a novel MDCK cell line (KIC-synd-1) that expressed the human syndecan-1 gene. In this cell line, we confirmed stable expression of both sndecan-1 gene and core protein. Immunohistochemical study revealed positive staining of syndecan-1 monoclonal antibody in the basolateral and cytosolic area of the KIC-synd-1 cells. We also investigated the composition of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) side chains in MDCK cells and KIC-synd-1 cells by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Four types of HS chains were identified in both cells as follows; delta diHS-NS, delta diHS-, delta diHS-diS1, delta diHS-diS2. Increased production of delta diHS-NS and delta diHS-diS2 were shown in KIC-synd-1 cells compared with production in MDCK cells (p < 0.05). In contrast, only a small amount of delta diHS- and delta diHS-diS1 was contained in both cell lines. Total amount of HS was significantly increased in the KIC-synd-1 cells compare with that in the wild type MDCK cells (p < 0.05). Scanning electron microscopy revealed no significant difference between cell surface of wild type MDCK cells and that of KIC-synd-1 cells in normal conditions. However, calcium oxalate crystal attachment was apparently decreased in the KIC-synd-1 cells. These results suggested that cell surface HS/syndecan-1 has preventive role for calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis via creation of a charge  against COM crystal attachment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8185676>Synthesis, biotransformation, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral properties of 5-ethyl-5-halo-6-methoxy-5,6-dihydro-2'-deoxyuridine diastereomers.</a></h2><p>Diastereomers of 5-ethyl-5-halo-6-methoxy-5,6-dihydro-2'-deoxyuridine were synthesized by the regiospecific addition of XOMe (X = Br, Cl) to the 5,6-olefinic bond of 5-ethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EDU). 5-(1-Hydroxyethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (HEDU) was identified as a metabolite of the 5-bromo-5-ethyl-6-methoxy-5,6-dihydro-2'-deoxyuridine diastereomers (BMEDU). The concentration of EDU and 5-ethyluracil (EU) in blood was higher after i.v. administration of the bromo diastereomers (BMEDU) to rats, relative to the concentration of EDU and EU after injection of the chloro (CMEDU) diastereomers. The CMEDU diastereomers were found to be oxidized less extensively to HEDU, were more stable to glycosidic bond cleavage, and were converted more slowly to EDU, than the BMEDU compounds. These BMEDU and CMEDU diastereomers exhibited pharmacokinetics characterized by a biphasic decline in plasma concentration. All diastereomers exhibited a characteristic second maximum blood concentration (Cmax), which was attributed to reabsorption after biliary excretion. All of these 5-ethyl-5-halo-6-methoxy-5,6-dihydro compounds, with the exception of (5S,)-BMEDU, had higher AUC values (ranging from 0.32 to 1.20 microM.hr.mL-1) and lower plasma clearances (10-36 mL.min-1) relative to the AUC values (0.14 microM.hr.mL-1) and plasma clearance (85 mL.min-1) of EDU. These BMEDU and CMEDU diastereomers are more lipophilic (log P = -0.42 to 0.40 range) than EDU (log P = -1.09), which should enhance their ability to cross the blood-brain . These 5,6-dihydro compounds showed higher levels (11-22%) of binding to bovine serum albumin than EDU (7%). The BMEDU compounds exhibited equipotent in vitro antiviral activity to EDU against HSV-1 and HSV-2, whereas the CMEDU analogs were inactive. The (5S,6R)-CMEDU diastereomer was equipotent to ganciclovir in the human cytomegalovirus assay.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24398459>Use of cassette dosing approach to examine the effects of P-glycoprotein on the brain and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations in wild-type and P-glycoprotein knockout rats.</a></h2><p>The study objectives were 1) to test the hypothesis that the lack of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and the inhibition of breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) at the blood-brain  after cassette dosing of potent P-gp and Bcrp inhibitors were due to low plasma concentrations of those inhibitors and 2) to examine the effects of P-gp on the unbound brain (C(u,brain)) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations (C(u,CSF)) of P-gp substrates in rats. In vitro inhibition of 11 compounds (amprenavir, citalopram, digoxin, elacridar, imatinib, Ko143 [(3S,,12aS)-1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12a-octahydro-9-methoxy-6-(2-methylpropyl)-1,4-dioxopyrazino[1',2':1,6]pyrido[3,4-b]indole-3-propanoic acid 1,1-dimethylethyl ester], loperamide, prazosin, quinidine, sulfasalazine, and verapamil) on P-gp and Bcrp was examined in P-gp- and Bcrp-expressing Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, respectively. An in vivo study was conducted in wild-type and Mdr1a(-/-) rats after subcutaneous cassette dosing of the 11 compounds at 1-3 mg/kg, and the brain, CSF, and plasma concentrations of these compounds were determined. At the maximal unbound concentrations observed in rats at 1-3 mg/kg, P-gp and Bcrp were not inhibited by a cassette of the 11 compounds. For non-P-gp/Bcrp substrates, similar C(u,brain), C(u,CSF), and unbound plasma concentrations (C(u,plasma)) were observed in wild-type and P-gp knockout rats. For P-gp/Bcrp substrates, C(u,brain) ≤ C(u,CSF) ≤ C(u,plasma) in wild-type rats, but C(u,brain) and C(u,CSF) increased in the P-gp knockout rats and were within 3-fold of C(u,plasma) for six of the seven P-gp substrates. These results indicate that P-gp and Bcrp inhibition at the blood-brain  is unlikely in cassette dosing and also suggest that P-gp and Bcrp activity at the blood-CSF  is functionally not important in determination of the CSF concentration for their substrates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2610718>Pharmacokinetics of acarbose.

The distribution of radioactivity to organs and tissues, the placental transfer and the secretion into milk was studied using whole-body autoradiographic methods and/or quantitative determination of total radioactivity after autopsy. Unchanged [14C]acarbose was distributed predominantly in the extracellular space, as observed after intravenous dosing to rats. According to the main excretion route, high concentrations were found in kidneys and urine and additionally in blood, lung, and connective tissue or interstitial space. The permeability of the blood/brain  for [14C]acarbose and/or its metabolites was very low. No indication was found for distinct differences in the distribution patterns in rats and dogs after intravenous and also in dogs after oral administration. In contrast, in rats after oral dosing the distribution pattern of radioactivity was different with relatively high concentrations in liver, kidney, adrenal gland, spleen, and intestinal mucosa. Due to the slow absorption of the microbial degradation products of [14C]acarbose from the intestine maximum concentrations in the different tissues were reached 8-24 h after dosing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22266779>Cerebrospinal fluid can be used as a surrogate to assess brain exposures of breast cancer resistance protein and P-glycoprotein substrates.</a></h2><p>The objectives of the study were to characterize the selectivity of dantrolene to breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) and to evaluate whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be used as a surrogate to assess brain exposures of BCRP and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) substrates. The impact of Bcrp and Pgp on dantrolene exposures in brain and CSF was examined in Bcrp and Mdr1a/1b knockout mice and was further investigated in wild-type mice in the presence of the Bcrp inhibitor (3S,,12aS)-1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12a-octahydro-9-methoxy-6-(2-methylpropyl)-1,4-dioxopyrazino[1',2':1,6]pyrido[3,4-b]indole-3-propanoic acid 1,1-dimethylethyl ester (Ko143), the Pgp inhibitor 6-[(2S,4R,6E)-4-methyl-2-(methylamino)-3-oxo-6-octenoic acid]-7-l-valine-cyclosporine A (PSC833), and the dual inhibitor N-(4-[2-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6,7-dimethoxy-2-isoquinolinyl)ethyl]-phenyl)-9,10-dihydro-5-methoxy-9-oxo-4-acridine carboxamide (GF120918). The effect of Bcrp and Pgp on digoxin exposures in brain and CSF was investigated in wild-type mice in the presence of the inhibitors. In vivo studies showed dantrolene exposures in brain and CSF, but not the blood, increased in Bcrp(-/-) and Mdr1a/1b(-/-)/Bcrp(-/-) mice, or in the presence of the Bcrp inhibitors Ko143 or GF120918. Inhibition of Pgp by GF120918 and PSC833 significantly increased digoxin exposures in brain, CSF, and blood to a lesser extent. Results from the present study demonstrated that inhibition of Bcrp and Pgp increased not only the exposures of dantrolene and digoxin in brain, but also the exposures in CSF. In addition, the change of exposures in CSF reflected the changes in brain. The present study strongly suggests that the dantrolene and digoxin exposures in CSF are primarily determined by the rapid transport from brain to CSF, and inhibition of Bcrp and Pgp exhibits little impact on using CSF as surrogates to assess brain exposures of Bcrp and Pgp substrates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7996541>Synthesis, in vitro biological stability, and anti-HIV activity of 5-halo-6-alkoxy(or azido)-5,6-dihydro-3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine diastereomers as potential prodrugs to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT).</a></h2><p>A new class of 5-halo-6-alkoxy(or azido)-5,6-dihydro-3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidines was investigated as potential anti-AIDS drugs. These 5,6-dihydro derivatives, which are also potential prodrugs to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), were designed in an effort to enhance the duration of action, lipophilicity, and cephalic delivery to the central nervous system. The 5-halo-6-alkoxy(or azido)-5,6-dihydro-3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidines, which differ in configuration at the C-5 and C-6 positions, were synthesized by the regiospecific addition of XR (X = Br, Cl, I; R = alkoxy, azido) to the 5,6-olefinic bond of AZT. The 5-halo-6-methoxy-5,6-dihydro derivatives of AZT are more lipophilic (P = 3.3-18.8 range) than the parent compound AZT (P = 1.29). These 5-halo-6-methoxy-5,6-dihydro compounds, like AZT, did not undergo glycosidic bond cleavage upon incubation with Escherichia coli thymidine phosphorylase. Regeneration of the 5,6-olefinic bond to give AZT, upon incubation of the 5-halo-6-methoxy-5,6-dihydro compounds with glutathione, mouse blood, or mouse liver homogenate, was dependent upon the nature of the 5-halo substituent (I > Br). No 5,6-olefinic bond regeneration was observed for the 5-chloro analogs. The ability of these 5-halo-6-alkoxy (or azido)-5,6-dihydro-3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidines to protect CEM cells against HIV-induced cytopathogenicity was evaluated. Structure-activity studies showed that the C-5 substituent (I, Br, Cl) was a determinant of anti-HIV-1 activity where the potency order was I > or = Br > Cl. In the 5-bromo series of compounds, the C-6 substituent was also a determinant of activity where 6-OMe and 6-OEt substituents exhibited a greater potency than the corresponding 6-i-PrO, 6-(1-octyloxy), 6-(1-hexadecyloxy), and 6-azido analogs. All of the 5-chloro-6-substituted-5,6-dihydro compounds were inactive, except for the approximately equipotent 6-OMe and 6-azido diastereomeric mixtures which were 2-3 log units less active than the reference drug AZT. The configuration at the C-5 and C-6 positions also influenced potency where the activity of the 5R,6R-diastereomer was generally greater than that of the corresponding 5S,-diastereomer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28435958>Potential energy surface for the reaction Sm + CO → SmO + CO: guided ion beam and theoretical studies.</a></h2><p>The potential energy surface (PES) for the oxidation of samarium cations by carbon dioxide is explored both experimentally and theoretically. Using guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometry, several reactions are examined as a  of kinetic energy. These include the title reaction as well as its reverse along with the collision-induced dissociation of Sm(CO) and OSm(CO) with Xe. Analysis of the kinetic energy dependent cross sections yields barriers for the forward and reverse oxidation reaction of 1.77 ± 0.11 and 2.04 ± 0.13 eV, respectively, and Sm-OCO and OSm-CO bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of 0.42 ± 0.03 and 0.97 ± 0.07 eV, respectively. BDEs for Sm(CO) for x = 2 and 3 are also determined as 0.40 ± 0.13 and 0.48 ± 0.12 eV, respectively. The PESs for the title reaction along the sextet and octet spin surfaces are also examined theoretically at the MP2 and CCSD(T) levels using both effective core potential and all-electron basis sets. Reasonable agreement between theory and experiment is obtained for the experimentally characterized intermediates, although all-electron basis sets and spin-orbit effects are needed for quantitative agreement. The observed  for oxidation is shown to likely correspond to the energy of the crossing between surfaces corresponding to the ground state electronic configuration of Sm (F,4f) and an excited surface having two electrons in the valence space (excluding 4f), which are needed to form the strong SmO bond.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18718505>Blood brain  (BBB) dysfunction associated with increased expression of tissue and urokinase plasminogen activators following peripheral thermal injury.</a></h2><p>Emerging data suggests the serine proteases, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), may play a detrimental role in traumatic states leading to compromise of the blood brain  (BBB). The purpose of our study was to define the role of endogenous tPA and uPA on the BBB following peripheral burn injuries. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=46) were studied in control and thermal injury groups. Rats were anesthetized and submerged in 100 degrees C water for  producing a third degree burn affecting 60-70% of the total body surface area. BBB dysfunction was then evaluated by measuring the amount of Evans blue and by calculating the water content in the brain. Levels of tPA and uPA mRNA in the brain were determined with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at 3 and 7h post-injury. Results showed an increase in the brain water content and the presence of Evans blue in the brain tissue of thermally injured rats, temporally associated with an increased expression of endogenous tPA and uPA. Our study demonstrates that peripheral thermal injury does induce an increase in the permeability of the BBB. A possible mechanism may be an increased expression of tPA and uPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24121561>Hydrolysis of the damaged deoxythymidine glycol nucleoside and comparison to canonical DNA.</a></h2><p>Genomic integrity is continually under attack by both endogenous and exogenous sources. One of the most common forms of damage is oxidation of the thymine nucleobase to form (5R,)-dihydroxy-5,6-dihydro-thymine (thymine glycol or Tg), which stops DNA polymerases and is thus cytotoxic. Thymine glycol damage is repaired through a variety of mechanisms, including the multi-step base excision repair (BER) pathway. In the first BER step, the glycosidic bond of the dTg nucleotide is hydrolyzed by a DNA glycosylase. In order to understand the catalytic effect of the glycosylases, the corresponding uncatalyzed mechanisms and barriers are required, as well as an appreciation of the relative reactivity of the glycosidic bond with respect to the corresponding canonical nucleoside. To this end, the PCM-B3LYP/6-31+G(d) reaction potential energy surfaces (PES) for deoxythymidine (dT) and dTg hydrolysis are characterized in the present study using solvent-phase optimizations and a model containing three explicit water molecules. The surfaces are comparable to those generated using functionals that account for dispersion interactions (B3LYP-D3 and M06-2X). Mapping the PES as a  of the glycosidic bond length and nucleophile-sugar distance reveals a synchronous S(N)2 mechanism as the lowest energy pathway for damaged dTg hydrolysis, which contrasts the preferred dissociative S(N)1 mechanism isolated for the deglycosylation of natural dT. As proposed for other enzymes, the difference in excision pathway may at least in part help the enzyme selectively target the damaged base and discriminate against the natural counterpart. Interestingly, the  to dTg deglycosylation (ΔG(‡) = 138.0 kJ mol(-1)) is much higher than for dT deglycosylation (ΔG(‡) = 112.7 kJ mol(-1)), which supports the stability of this lesion and clarifies the catalytic feat presented to DNA repair enzymes that remove this detrimental damage from the genome. Although nucleotide excision repair (NER) typically targets bulky DNA lesions, the large calculated  for dTg deglycosylation rationalizes why the NER mechanism also excises this non-bulky lesion from cellular DNA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22454535>Impact of P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2) on the brain distribution of a novel BRAF inhibitor: vemurafenib (PLX4032).</a></h2><p>Vemurafenib [N-(3-{[5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl]carbonyl}-2,4-difluorophenyl)propane-1-sulfonamide(PLX4032)] is a novel small-molecule BRAF inhibitor, recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma with a BRAF(V600E) mutation. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in the distribution of vemurafenib to the central nervous system. In vitro studies conducted in transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells show that the intracellular accumulation of vemurafenib is significantly restricted because of active efflux by P-gp and BCRP. Bidirectional flux studies indicated greater transport in the basolateral-to-apical direction than the apical-to-basolateral direction because of active efflux by P-gp and BCRP. The selective P-gp and BCRP inhibitors zosuquidar and (3S,,12aS)-1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12a-octahydro-9-methoxy-6-(2-methylpropyl)-1,4-dioxopyrazino(1',2':1,6)pyrido(3,4-b)indole-3-propanoic acid-1,1-dimethylethyl ester (Ko143) were able to restore the intracellular accumulation and bidirectional net flux of vemurafenib. The in vivo studies revealed that the brain distribution coefficient (area under the concentration time profile of brain/area under the concentration time profile of plasma) of vemurafenib was 0.004 in wild-type mice. The steady-state brain-to-plasma ratio of vemurafenib was 0.035 ± 0.009 in Mdr1a/b(-/-) mice, 0.009 ± 0.006 in Bcrp1(-/-) mice, and 1.00 ± 0.19 in Mdr1a/b(-/-)Bcrp1(-/-) mice compared with 0.012 ± 0.004 in wild-type mice. These data indicate that the brain distribution of vemurafenib is severely restricted at the blood-brain  because of active efflux by both P-gp and BCRP. This finding has important clinical significance given the ongoing trials examining the efficacy of vemurafenib in brain metastases of melanoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2293090>Molecular forms of butyrylcholinesterase in rat brain microvessels.</a></h2><p>Molecular forms of butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) were studied in microvessels isolated from rat brain, using sedimentation analysis in sucrose gradients.

The relative proportion of the 3 forms was 19% for the monomer, 33% for the dimer and 46% for the tetramer.

Its diverse range of substrates includes many common chemotherapeutics such as imatinib, doxorubicin, and mitoxantrone. Physiologically, ABCG2 is highly expressed in areas such as the blood-brain  and gastrointestinal tract, where it is thought to play a role in protection against xenobiotic exposure. High ABCG2 expression has also been found in a variety of solid tumors and in hematologic malignancies and has been correlated with poorer clinical outcomes. Furthermore, ABCG2 expression is a characteristic feature of cancer stem cells, which are able to self-renew and differentiate. These cancer stem cells have been postulated to play an important role in MDR, where their inherent ABCG2 expression may allow them to survive chemotherapy and repopulate the tumor after exposure to chemotherapeutics. This observation raises the exciting possibility that by inhibiting ABCG2, cancer stem cells and other cancers may be targeted and eradicated, at which point conventional chemotherapeutics would be sufficient to eliminate the remaining tumor cells.

Positron emission tomography (PET) allows the in vivo estimation of the relationship between the plasma concentration of a drug and its target occupancy, optimizing dose selection and reducing the time and cost of early development. Triple reuptake inhibitors (TRIs), also referred to as serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors, enhance monoaminergic neurotransmission by blocking the action of the monoamine transporters, raising extracellular concentrations of those neurotransmitters. GSK1360707 [(1R,)-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-6-(methoxymethyl)-4-azabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane] is a novel TRI that until recently was under development for the treatment of major depressive disorder; its development was put on hold for strategic reasons. We present the results of an in vivo assessment of the relationship between plasma exposure and transporter blockade (occupancy). Studies were performed in baboons (Papio anubis) to determine the relationship between plasma concentration and occupancy of brain serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT), dopamine reuptake transporter (DAT), and norepinephrine uptake transporter (NET) using the radioligands [(11)C]DASB [(N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-cyanophenylthio) benzylamine], [(11)C]PE2I [N-(3-iodoprop-2E-enyl)-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-methylphenyl)nortropane], and [(11)C]2-[(2-methoxyphenoxy)phenylmethyl]morpholine (also known as [(11)C]MRB) and in humans using [(11)C]DASB and [(11)C]PE2I. In P. anubis, plasma concentrations resulting in half-maximal occupancy at SERT, DAT, and NET were 15.16, 15.56, and 0.97 ng/ml, respectively. In humans, the corresponding values for SERT and DAT were 6.80 and 18.00 ng/ml. GSK1360707 dose-dependently blocked the signal of SERT-, DAT-, and NET-selective PET ligands, confirming its penetration across the blood-brain  and blockade of all three monoamine transporters in vivo.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17328531>A quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics study of the catalytic mechanism of the thymidylate synthase.</a></h2><p>A theoretical study of the molecular mechanism of the thymidylate synthase-catalyzed reaction has been carried out using hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods. We have examined all of the stationary points (reactants, intermediates, transition structures, and products) on the multidimensional potential energy surfaces for the multistep enzymatic process. The characterization of these relevant structures facilitates the gaining of insight into the role of the different residues in the active site. Furthermore, analysis of the full energy profile has revealed that the step corresponding to the reduction of the exocyclic methylene intermediate by hydride transfer from the  position of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (H4folate), forming dTMP and 7,8-dihydrofolate (H2folate), is the rate-limiting step, in accordance with the experimental data. In this step, the hydride transfer and the scission of an overall conserved active site cysteine residue (Cys146 in Escherichia coli) take place in a concerted but very asynchronous way. These findings have also been tested with primary and secondary deuterium, tritium, and sulfur kinetic isotope effects, and the calculations have been compared to experimental data. Finally, the incorporation of high-level quantum mechanical corrections to the semiempirical AM1 Hamiltonian into our hybrid scheme has allowed us to obtain reasonable values of the energy  for the rate-limiting step. The resulting picture of the complete multistep enzyme mechanism that is obtained reveals several new features of substantial mechanistic interest.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7680631>Putative inhibitory extracellular matrix molecules at the dorsal root entry zone of the spinal cord during development and after root and sciatic nerve lesions.</a></h2><p>The dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) of the spinal cord is the interface between the central and peripheral nervous systems and is the pathway through which sensory afferents enter the central nervous system during development. However, in the rat, the DREZ becomes a boundary to regenerating sensory axons after Postnatal Days 2-3. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that cause regenerative failure at the DREZ after the critical period for regeneration are unknown. Recent studies demonstrate that two extracellular matrix molecules, Cytotactin/tenascin (CT) and chondroitin 6-sulfate-containing proteoglycans (C--PG) are present in normal boundary regions of the brain and spinal cord during development. In the present study we sought to visualize the expression of these two putative inhibitory molecules in the DREZ of normally developing and adult animals, and also in animals after injury. CT and C--PG spread laterally from the midline to the DREZ by Postnatal Day 3, correlating exactly with the end of the critical period. The staining intensity for these two molecules increases further in the DREZ after root lesions, but not sciatic lesions, at ages when axons cannot regenerate into the spinal cord. Following root lesion CT and C--PG were mostly present in association with reactive glia at the DREZ and in white matter, rather than with reactive glia in grey matter of the dorsal horn, suggesting that astroglia are heterogeneous in their response to root lesion. The coexpression of CT and C--PG may create a molecular  which might channel or deflect axons at the DREZ during CNS development and inhibit their growth during regeneration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15755453>Single molecule studies of antibody-antigen interaction strength versus intra-molecular antigen stability.</a></h2><p>We investigated molecular recognition of antibodies to membrane-antigens and extraction of the antigens out of membranes at the single molecule level.

The antibody/antigen interaction strength of 70-170 pN at loading rates of 2-50 nN/second yielded a  width of x = 0.12 nm and a kinetic off-rate (corresponding to the  height) of k(off) = (-1), respectively. Bacteriorhodopsin unfolding revealed a characteristic intra-molecular force pattern, in which wild-type and sendai-bacteriorhodopsin molecules were clearly distinguishable in their length distributions, originating from the additional 13 amino acid residues epitope in sendai purple membranes. The inter-molecular antibody/antigen unbinding force was significantly lower than the force required to mechanically extract the binding epitope-containing helix pair out of the membrane and unfold it (126 pN compared to 204 pN at the same loading rate), meeting the expectation that inter-molecular unbinding forces are weaker than intra-molecular unfolding forces responsible for stabilizing native conformations of proteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22328585>Use of the cassette-dosing approach to assess brain penetration in drug discovery.</a></h2><p>The objective of the present study was to examine the cassette dosing method in determination of brain-to-plasma concentration ratio (area under the concentration-time profiles for plasma/area under the concentration-time profiles for brain, K(p)). Eleven model compounds, amprenavir, citalopram, digoxin, elacridar, imatinib, (3S,,12aS)-1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12a-octahydro-9-methoxy-6-(2-methylpropyl)-1,4-dioxopyrazino[1',2':1,6]pyrido[3,4-b]indole-3-propanoic acid 1,1-dimethylethyl ester (Ko143), loperamide, prazosin, quinidine, sulfasalazine, and verapamil, were selected to compare their K(p) determined from discrete dosing in wild-type mice and their K(p) from cassette dosing in wild-type, Mdr1a/1b(-/-), Bcrp1(-/-), and Mdr1a/1b(-/-)/Bcrp1(-/-) mice at 1 to 3 mg/kg. The mice brain and plasma were collected at 0.25, 1, and 3 h and were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods. The K(p) determined from discrete dosing versus cassette dosing in the wild-type mice were within 2-fold for all the compounds except sulfasalazine and Ko143. The brain concentrations of sulfasalazine and Ko143 and the plasma concentrations of Ko143 were below the lower limit of quantitation. In addition, the K(p) values estimated by mass spectrometry responses, namely the ratio of compound peak area to internal standard peak area, were within 2-fold of the K(p) observed from the actual concentrations. Furthermore, the ratios of K(p) in Mdr1a/1b(-/-), Bcrp1(-/-), and Mdr1a/1b(-/-)/Bcrp1(-/-) mice versus the K(p) in the wild-type mice from cassette dosing were consistent with the ones reported in the literature where the compounds were dosed discretely. These results demonstrate that drug-drug interactions at the blood-brain  are unlikely at a subcutaneous dose of 1 to 3 mg/kg and support the use of the cassette dosing approach to assess brain penetration in drug discovery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25691630>Raltegravir permeability across blood-tissue barriers and the potential role of drug efflux transporters.</a></h2><p>The objectives of this study were to investigate raltegravir transport across several blood-tissue  models and the potential interactions with drug efflux transporters. Raltegravir uptake, accumulation, and permeability were evaluated in vitro in (i) P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), or MRP4-overexpressing MDA-MDR1 (P-gp), HEK-ABCG2, HeLa-MRP1, or HEK-MRP4 cells, respectively; (ii) cell culture systems of the human blood-brain (hCMEC/D3), mouse blood-testicular (TM4), and human blood-intestinal (Caco-2) barriers; and (iii) rat jejunum and ileum segments using an in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion model. [(3)H]Raltegravir accumulation by MDA-MDR1 (P-gp) and HEK-ABCG2-overexpressing cells was significantly enhanced in the presence of PSC833 {6-[(2S,4R,6E)-4-methyl-2-(methylamino)-3-oxo-6-octenoic acid]-7-L-valine-cyclosporine}, a P-gp inhibitor, or Ko143 [(3S,,12aS)-1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12a-octahydro-9-methoxy-6-(2-methylpropyl)-1,4-dioxopyrazino[1',2':1,6]pyrido[3,4-b]indole-3-propanoic acid 1,1-dimethylethyl ester], a BCRP inhibitor, suggesting the inhibition of a P-gp- or BCRP-mediated efflux process, respectively. Furthermore, [(3)H]raltegravir accumulation by human cerebral microvessel endothelial hCMEC/D3 and mouse Sertoli TM4 cells was significantly increased by PSC833 and Ko143. In human intestinal Caco-2 cells grown on Transwell filters, PSC833, but not Ko143, significantly decreased the [(3)H]raltegravir efflux ratios. In rat intestinal segments, [(3)H]raltegravir in situ permeability was significantly enhanced by the concurrent administration of PSC833 and Ko143. In contrast, in the transporter inhibition assays, raltegravir (10 to 500 μM) did not increase the accumulation of substrate for P-gp (rhodamine-6G), BCRP ([(3)H]mitoxantrone), or MRP1 [2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF)] by MDA-MDR1 (P-gp)-, HEK-ABCG2-, or HeLa-MRP1-overexpressing cells, respectively. Our data suggest that raltegravir is a substrate but not an inhibitor of the drug efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP. These transporters might play a role in the restriction of raltegravir permeability across the blood-brain, blood-testicular, and blood-intestinal barriers, potentially contributing to its low tissue concentrations and/or low oral bioavailability observed in the clinic setting.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Ginger extract (GE) confers significant health-promoting benefits owing to complex additive and/or synergistic interactions between its bioactive constituents. Recently, we showed that preservation of natural "milieu" confers superior anticancer activity on GE over its constituent phytochemicals, 6-gingerol (6G), 8-gingerol (8 G), 10-gingerol (10 G) and 6-shogaol (), through enterohepatic recirculation. Here we further evaluate and compare the effects of GE and its major bioactive constituents on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity in human liver microsomes by monitoring metabolites of CYP-specific substrates using LC/MS/MS detection methods. Our data demonstrate that individual gingerols are potent inhibitors of CYP isozymes, whereas GE exhibits a much higher half-maximal inhibition value, indicating no possible herb-drug interactions. However, GE's inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2C8 reflects additive interactions among the constituents. In addition, studies performed to evaluate transporter-mediated intestinal efflux using Caco-2 cells revealed that GE and its phenolics are not substrates of P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Intriguingly, however, 10 G and  were not detected in the receiver compartment, indicating possible biotransformation across the Caco-2 monolayer. These data strengthen the notion that an interplay of complex interactions among ginger phytochemicals when fed as whole extract dictates its bioactivity highlighting the importance of consuming whole foods over single agents. Our study substantiates the need for an in-depth analysis of hepatic biotransformation events and distribution profiles of GE and its active phenolics for the design of safe regimens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26148857>The Inhibitor Ko143 Is Not Specific for ABCG2.</a></h2><p>Imaging ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter activity in vivo with positron emission tomography requires both a substrate and a transporter inhibitor. However, for ABCG2, there is no inhibitor proven to be specific to that transporter alone at the blood-brain . Ko143 [[(3S,,12aS)-1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12a-octahydro-9-methoxy-6-(2-methylpropyl)-1,4-dioxopyrazino[1',2':1,6]pyrido[3,4- b]indole-3-propanoic acid 1,1-dimethylethyl ester], a nontoxic analog of fungal toxin fumitremorgin C, is a potent inhibitor of ABCG2, although its specificity in mouse and human systems is unclear. This study examined the selectivity of Ko143 using human embryonic kidney cell lines transfected with ABCG2, ABCB1, or ABCC1 in several in vitro assays. The stability of Ko143 in rat plasma was measured using high performance liquid chromatography. Our results show that, in addition to being a potent inhibitor of ABCG2, at higher concentrations (≥1 μM) Ko143 also has an effect on the transport activity of both ABCB1 and ABCC1. Furthermore, Ko143 was found to be unstable in rat plasma. These findings indicate that Ko143 lacks specificity for ABCG2 and this should be taken into consideration when using Ko143 for both in vitro and in vivo experiments.U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27255177>Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a novel series of peripheral-selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors-Part 2.</a></h2><p>Peripherally selective inhibition of noradrenaline reuptake is a novel mechanism for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence to overcome adverse effects associated with central action. Herein, we describe our medicinal chemistry approach to discover peripheral-selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors to avert the risk of P-gp-mediated DDI at the blood-brain . We observed that steric shielding of the hydrogen-bond acceptors and donors (HBA and HBD) of compound 1 reduced the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) efflux ratio; however, the resulting compound 6, a methoxyacetamide derivative, was mainly metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 in the in vitro phenotyping study, implying the risk of PK variability based on the genetic polymorphism of the CYPs. Replacement of the hydrogen atom with a deuterium atom in a strategic, metabolically hot spot led to compound 13, which was mainly metabolized by CYP3A4. To our knowledge, this study represents the first report of the effect of deuterium replacement for a major metabolic enzyme. The compound 13, N-{[(,7R)-7-(4-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-1,4-oxazepan-6-yl]methyl}-2-[(2H(3))methyloxy]acetamide hydrochloride, which exhibited peripheral NET selective inhibition at tested doses in rats, increased urethral resistance in a dose-dependent manner.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
