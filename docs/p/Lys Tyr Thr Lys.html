Plasma ammonia concentrations increased to 411 microm within 1 h of the start of infusion of ammonium acetate at 567 mmol/h. The rate constant for ammonia clearance from plasma was 0 x 054/min and the half-life was 12 x 9 min. Infusion at 567 mmol/h for 1 h followed by 1 h without infusion, repeated four times between am- and pm-milking, caused a decrease in feed intake. Compared with sodium acetate, continuous infusion of ammonium acetate at 360 mmol/h throughout an entire 10-h milking interval increased plasma ammonia concentrations to 193 microm and caused a 20% decrease in milk, protein and lactose production with no effect on percentage composition of milk or the yield of milk . Arterial concentrations of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids tended to increase; there was no effect on arterial acetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate or triacylglcerol, and branched-chain amino acids,  and  decreased. Mammary plasma flow, estimated by assuming 100% uptake/output of Phe+, was significantly correlated with milk yield. Mammary uptakes of acetate tended to be reduced by hyperammonaemia, but uptakes of other energy metabolites and amino acids were not affected. Thus, while an increase in amino acid consumption during hyperammonaemia was apparent from the drop in circulating concentrations of Leu, Ile, Val,  and , there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that milk yield is affected by the lower concentrations. An ammonia-induced depression in feed intake may have caused the decrease in milk synthesis.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9263881>A model of scorpion toxin binding to voltage-gated K+ channels.</a></h2><p>Mutational studies have identified part of the S5-S6 loop of voltage-dependent K+ channels (P region) responsible for tetraethylammonium (TEA) block and permeation properties. Several scorpion peptide toxins-charybdotoxin (ChTX), kaliotoxin (KITX), and agitoxin (AgTX)-also block the channel with high affinity and specificity. Here, we examine the interaction predicted when the toxins are docked onto the molecular model of the K+ channel pore that we recently proposed. Docking with the model of the Kv1.3 channel started by location of -27 side chain into the central axis of the pore, followed by  minimization. In the optimal arrangement, Arg-24 of KITX or AgTX forms a hydrogen bond with the Asp-386 carboxyl of one subunit, and Asn-30 is in immediate contact with Asp-386 of the opposing subunit in the tetramer. Toxin residues in proximity to the side chain of -27 (Phe-25, -36, Met-29, and Ser-11 in KITX) interact with the four C-end His-404s. For ChTX the interaction with Asp-386 is reduced, but this is compensated by additional nonbonded interactions formed by -36 and Arg-34. Comparison of calculated  of interaction of these specific toxin-channel residues with experimental studies reveals good agreement. The similar total calculated  of interaction is consistent with the similar IC50 for Kv1.3 block by KITX and AgTX. Steric contacts of residues in position 380 of the S5-P linker with residues on the upper part of toxins permit reconstruction of the K+ channel outer vestibule walls, which are about 30 A apart and about 9 A high. Molecular modeling shows complementarity of the pore model to toxin spacial structures, and supports the proposal that the N-terminal borders of the P regions surround residues of their C-terminal halves.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8601843>Amino acid pair interchanges at spatially conserved locations.</a></h2><p>Here we study the pattern of amino acid interchanges at spatially, locally conserved regions in globally dissimilar and unrelated proteins. By using a method which completely separates the amino acid sequence from its respective structure, this work addresses the question of which properties of the amino acids are the most crucial for the stability of conserved structural motifs. The proteins are taken from a structurally non-redundant dataset. The spatially conserved substructural motifs are defined as consisting of a "large enough" number of Calpha atoms found to provide a geometric match between two proteins, regardless of the order of the Calpha atoms in the sequence, or of the sequence composition of the substructures. This approach can apply to proteins with little or no sequence similarity but with sufficient structural similarity, and is unique in its ability to handle local, non-topological matches between pairs of dissimilar proteins. The method uses a computer-version based algorithm, the Geometric Hashing. Since the Geometric Hashing ignores sequence information it lends itself to answer the question posed above. The interchanges at geometrically similar positions that have been obtained with our method demonstrate the expected behaviour. Yet, a closer inspection reveals some distant characteristics, as compared with interchanges based upon sequence-order based techniques, or from -contact-based considerations. First, a pronounced division of the amino acids into two classes is displayed: , Glu, Arg, Gln, Asp, Asn, Pro, Gly, , Ser and His on the one hand, and Ile, Val, Leu, Phe, Met, , Trp, Cys and Ala on the other. These groups further cluster into subgroups: , Glu, Arg, Gln; Asp Asn; Pro, Gly; Ile, Val, Leu, Phe. The other amino acids stand alone. Analysis of the conservation among amino acids indicates proline to be consistently, by far, the most conserved. Next are Asp, Glu,  and Gly. Cys is also highly conserved. Interestingly, oppositely charged amino acids are interchanged roughly as frequently as those of the same charge. These observations can be explained in terms of the three-dimensional structures of the proteins. Most of all, there is a clear distinction between residues which prefer to be on the protein surfaces, compared to those frequently buried in the interiors. Analysis of the interchanges indicates their low information content. This, together with the separation into two groups, suggest that the predictive value of the spatial positions of the Calpha+ atoms is not much greater than the sequence alone, aside from their hydrophobicity/hydrophillicity classification.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31013895>Eight Collagen Peptides from Hydrolysate Fraction of Spanish Mackerel Skins: Isolation, Identification, and In Vitro Antioxidant Activity Evaluation.</a></h2><p>A previous report indicated that collagen hydrolysate fraction (F7) from Spanish mackerel () skins showed high reducing power and radical scavenging activities on 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (EC value of 1.57 mg/mL) and hydroxyl (EC value of 1.20 mg/mL).

Allophycocyanins I and B had red-shifted fluorescence emission maxima, and on this basis, may function in transfer of excitation  from phycobilisomes to chlorophyll a. Allophycyanins II and III, which together comprise 70% of the total allophycocyanin, have absorption maxima at 648 nm and 650 nm, respectively, and probably transfer excitation  from phycocyanin to allophycocyanins I and B, in addition to serving a structural function. Allophycocyanin I was resolved into alpha, beta, and gamma subunits with apparent molecular weights of 18,000, 17,000, and 35,000, respectively, whereas allophycocyanin B was resolved into two subunits with apparent molecular weights of 16,100 and 15,300, using a modified Weber and Osborn gel electrophoresis system (Brown, A.

In the same gel system, allophycocyanins II and III were each resolved into alpha and beta subunits with apparent molecular weights of 18,000 and 17,000, respectively. The subunits of allophycocyanins I, II, and III were isolated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography and the amino acid compositions determined. Automated sequence analysis demonstrated that the first 30 amino acids at the NH2 terminus of alpha subunits, and the beta subunits, of allophycocyanins I to III were identical. alpha Subunits: Ser-Ile-Val---Ser-Ile-Val-Asn-Ala-Asp-Ala-Glu-Ala-Arg--Leu-Ser-Pro-Gly -Glu-Leu-Asp-Arg-Ile--Ser-Phe-Val-- beta Subunits: Ala-Gln-Asp-Ala-Ile--Ala-Val-Ile-Asn-Ala-Ala-Asp-Val-Gln-Gly---Leu-Asp-Ala--Ala-Leu-Ser--Leu--Ala-- The gamma subunit of allophycocyanin I and both subunits of allophycocyanin B appeared to be blocked at the NH2 terminus, suggesting that the allophycocyanin B subunits may be different gene products than those of allophycocyanins I to III, or if the same, the subunits of allophycocyanin B undergo proteolytic modification after initial synthesis.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20460665>Metabolizable  and standardized ileal digestible amino acid contents of expeller-extracted canola meal fed to broiler chicks.</a></h2><p>An experiment was conducted to determine the standardized ileal digestible amino acid (AA) and AMEn contents of expeller-extracted canola meal (EECM) fed to broiler chicks. One hundred forty-four broiler chicks were divided into 24 groups of 6 birds balanced for BW and fed 4 diets in a completely randomized design (6 groups per diet) from d 14 to 21 of age. The diets were a corn-soybean meal-based basal diet formulated to meet NRC nutrient requirements, the basal diet with - and AA-yielding ingredients replaced by 30% of either solvent-extracted canola meal (SECM) or EECM, and a low-protein casein-cornstarch-based diet. The SECM, which is commonly used in formulating poultry diets, was fed for comparison with EECM, whereas the casein-cornstarch-based diet was fed to estimate basal endogenous AA losses for determining standardized ileal digestibility of AA. All 4 diets contained titanium oxide (0.3%) as an indigestible marker, and nutrient digestibility and retention were determined by the substitution method. From d 19 to 21, excreta samples were collected for AMEn determination. On d 21, the birds were killed by cervical dislocation, and contents of the whole ileum were obtained for determination of AA digestibility. Expeller-extracted canola meal had greater (P<0.05) standardized ileal digestible contents of Gly, Leu, Ser, , Asp, and Glu and tended to have greater (P<0.10) standardized ileal digestible contents of Ile, , Phe, Ala, and  than SECM. Compared with SECM, EECM had greater (P<0.001) AMEn (2,694 vs. 1,801 kcal/kg).

The large subunit (BphA1) of Bph Dox plays a crucial role in the determination of the substrate specificity of biphenyl-related compounds including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Previously, the substitution of Asn at -376 near the active-site iron in the BphA1 of Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 expanded the oxidation range and altered the regiospecificity of Bph Dox for PCBs. In this study, we replaced -376 with Gly, Ser, Gln, , Val, Phe, Asp, and  and expressed these enzymes in Escherichia coli. Bph Dox mutants of Thr376Asn, Thr376Val, Thr376Phe, and Thr376Lys showed novel degradation activity for dibenzofuran, which is a poor substrate for KF707 Bph Dox. All active Bph Dox mutants showed altered regiospecificity with 2,2'-dichlorobiphenyl and 2,5,4'-trichlorobiphenyl. The Thr376Gly, Thr376Val, Thr376Phe, and Thr376Asp Bph Dox mutants introduced molecular  at the 2,3 position of 2,2'-dichlorobiphenyl, forming 2-chloro-2',3'-dihydroxybiphenyl with concomitant dechlorination. The Bph Dox mutants of Thr376Gly, Thr376Ser, Thr376Asp, and Thr376Lys attacked 2,5,4'-trichlorobiphenyl via both 2',3'- and 3,4-dioxygenation activities. In particular, the Thr376Phe Bph Dox mutant exhibited enhanced and expanded degradation activities toward all of the compounds tested. Further site-directed mutation was induced to change the oxidizing character of KF707 Bph Dox to that of the Bph Dox of Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 by the substitution of two amino acids, Ile335Phe and Thr376Asn, near the active-site.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30005070>Fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs exhibit differences in nutrient composition according to body weight and gestational period.</a></h2><p>Low birth weight may negatively affect  storage and nutrient metabolism, and impair fetal growth and development. We analyzed effects of body weight (BW) and gestational period on nutrient composition in fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs. Fetuses with the lowest BW (LBW), middle BW (MBW), and highest BW (HBW) were collected at days 45, 75, and 110 of gestation. Crude protein (CP), crude fat, amino acid (AA), and fatty acid (FA) concentrations were determined. The BW gain, carcass weight, fat percentage, and uterus weight of sows increased as gestation progressed, as did litter weight, average individual fetal weight, fetal body weight, and dry matter (DM). The concentrations of Ala, Arg, crude fat, Gly, Pro, , C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1n9c, C18:2n6c, C18:3n3, C18:3n6, C20:0, C20:3n6, saturated FA (SFA), and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) increased significantly as gestation progressed.

The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is involved in  homeostasis, food intake, sexual function, and obesity.

We have previously reported that a monocyclic hAGRP(103-122) peptide is an antagonist at the melanocortin receptors expressed in the brain. Stereochemical inversion from the endogenous l- to d-isomers of single or multiple amino acid modifications in this monocyclic truncated hAGRP sequence resulted in molecules that are converted from melanocortin receptor antagonists into melanocortin receptor agonists. The Asp-Pro-Ala-Ala--Ala--cyclo[Cys-Arg-DPhe-DPhe-Asn-Ala-Phe-Cys]--Ala-Arg--Leu peptide resulted in a 60 nM melanocortin-1 receptor agonist that is 100-fold selective versus the mMC4R, 1000-fold selective versus the mMC3R, and ca. 180-fold selective versus the mMC5R. In attempts to identify putative ligand-receptor interactions that may be participating in the agonist induced stimulation of the MC4R, selected ligands were docked into a homology molecular model of the mMC4R.

Once attached to a substrate, the 76-amino acid protein ubiquitin is subjected to further modifications, creating a multitude of distinct signals with distinct cellular outcomes, referred to as the 'ubiquitin code'. Ubiquitin can be ubiquitinated on seven lysine () residues or on the N-terminus, leading to polyubiquitin chains that can encompass complex topologies. Alternatively or in addition, ubiquitin  residues can be modified by ubiquitin-like molecules (such as SUMO or NEDD8). Finally, ubiquitin can also be acetylated on , or phosphorylated on Ser,  or  residues, and each modification has the potential to dramatically alter the signaling outcome. While the number of distinctly modified ubiquitin species in cells is mind-boggling, much progress has been made to characterize the roles of distinct ubiquitin modifications, and many enzymes and receptors have been identified that create, recognize or remove these ubiquitin modifications. We here provide an overview of the various ubiquitin modifications present in cells, and highlight recent progress on ubiquitin chain biology.

In Exp. 1, 180 day-old Ross broiler chicks were randomly distributed between 6 pen replicates (15 chicks each) of 2 dietary treatments; diets based on SBM or extruded SBM (ESBM) as the main protein sources. Based on the results of Exp. 1 and AA digestibility assay, Exp. 2 was designed using 216 day-old Ross broiler chicks (6 replicates of 18 chicks each), in which dietary SBM content was replaced by 86% using ESBM. This replacement caused about a 9% decrease in dietary crude protein (CP) level. Results showed that coefficients of CP and AA digestibility were greater (P < 0.05) for ESBM than those of SBM. Extrusion processing of SBM increased digestibility coefficients of , , Cys, Leu, Phe, , Pro, Ser, and Gly. Except during the starter period, dietary inclusion of ESBM increased (P < 0.05) average daily feed intake (ADFI) in Exp. 1 and caused increases (P < 0.01) in average daily weight gains (ADWG) throughout the trial period. Also, using ESBM improved the (P < 0.01) feed conversion ratio (FCR) during starter and finisher periods. In Exp. 2, reducing dietary CP level using ESBM decreased both ADFI (P < 0.05) and ADWG (P < 0.01) in the starter period. During grower, finisher, and entire trial periods, however, ADFI and ADWG were not influenced by dietary treatments. Dietary inclusion of ESBM improved (P < 0.05) FCR value in the finisher period. Although carcass yield was not affected by dietary treatments, reducing dietary CP level resulted in an increase (P < 0.05) in abdominal fat percentage. Moreover, a decrease in dietary CP level reduced (P = 0.08) breast yield. The present findings indicate that extrusion of SBM could improve its nutritive value for broiler chicks. Using ESBM, one can reduce dietary CP level by about 9% without any detrimental effect on performance parameters of broiler chicks.© 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25161153>Emerging roles of post-translational modifications in signal transduction and angiogenesis.</a></h2><p>The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) belongs to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases and is a key player in vasculogenesis and pathological angiogenesis.

Maximum protein degradation activity was obtained when BSD1 was inoculated with an inoculum of 5% into a medium with glucose as carbon source and initial pH value of 7.0 and incubated at 30°C for 48 h. In this optimal condition, protein concentration decreased from 156.8 mg/L to 19.2 mg/L, and protein degradation efficiency of BSD1 reached 88%. Free amino acid analysis showed that the content of Phe, , Pro, Ala, ,  and His increased in protein degradation process. After degradation, NHN concentration producing in medium supernatant reached 232.2 mg/L. These results indicated the strain BSD1 could transform proteins into free amino acids and eventually convert them to ammonium or ammonia. Furthermore, strain BSD1 could also be used for deproteinization of brewery spent diatomite and 51% of proteins in spent diatomite were degraded. After biological deproteinization the specific surface area and total pore volume of diatomite improved obviously.

Computer-aided designing is the initial steps for screening the novel inhibitors.To identify and evaluate natural compounds with low side effects with high efficacy against V. cholerae has been done.In silico screening, absorption, digestion, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), and docking of herbal compounds have been performed on to the target ToxT (transcriptional activator of V. cholerae). The compound with good ADME properties and drug-likeness property were subjected to docking.From 70 herbal compounds, some compounds such as aloin, campesterol, lupeol, and ursolic acid showed a violation of the rule of five and compounds such as lupeol and beta carotene showed negative binding . Luteolin, catechin, brevifolin, etc., compounds were selected based on ADME, drug-likeness property, and docking studies.Two compounds named catechin and luteolin showed better inhibition properties against ToxT and good ADME and drug-likeness property were selected as a better lead molecule for drug development in future. The Genetic Optimization for Ligand Docking fitness score for catechin is 48.74 kcal/mol and luteolin 38.12 kcal/mol.Vibrio cholerae became antibiotic resistance and associated with several cholera epidemic and pandemic.

Here, we have used the apical muscle of the starfish Patiria pectinifera to assay for myorelaxants in extracts of this species. A hexadecapeptide with the amino acid sequence Phe-Gly--Gly-Gly-Ala--Asp-Pro-Leu-Ser-Ala-Gly-Phe--Asp was identified and designated starfish myorelaxant peptide (SMP). Cloning and sequencing of a cDNA encoding the SMP precursor protein revealed that it comprises 12 copies of SMP as well as 3 peptides (7 copies in total) that are structurally related to SMP. Analysis of the expression of SMP precursor transcripts in P. pectinifera using qPCR revealed the highest expression in the radial nerve cords and lower expression levels in a range of neuromuscular tissues, including the apical muscle, tube feet and cardiac stomach. Consistent with these findings, SMP also caused relaxation of tube foot and cardiac stomach preparations. Furthermore, SMP caused relaxation of apical muscle preparations from another starfish species - Asterias amurensis. Collectively, these data indicate that SMP has a general physiological role as a muscle relaxant in starfish. Interestingly, comparison of the sequence of the SMP precursor with known neuropeptide precursors revealed that SMP belongs to a bilaterian family of neuropeptides that include molluscan pedal peptides (PP) and arthropodan orcokinins (OK). This is the first study to determine the function of a PP/OK-type peptide in a deuterostome. Pedal peptide/orcokinin (PP/OK)-type peptides are a family of structurally related neuropeptides that were first identified and functionally characterised in protostomian invertebrates. Here, we report the discovery of starfish myorelaxant peptide (SMP), a novel member of the PP/OK-type neuropeptide identified in the starfish Patiria pectinifera (phylum Echinodermata). SMP is the first PP/OK-type neuropeptide to be functionally characterised in a deuterostome.© 2016 The Authors.

This study presents a statistical-thermodynamic analysis of relationship between the sequence composition and the distribution of residue fluctuations in protein-protein complexes. A one-node-per-residue elastic network model accounting for the nonhomogeneous protein mass distribution and the interatomic interactions through the renormalized inter-residue potential is developed. Two factors, a protein mass distribution and a residue environment, were found to determine the scale of residue fluctuations. Surface residues undergo larger fluctuations than core residues in agreement with experimental observations. Ranking residues over the normalized scale of fluctuations yields a distinct classification of amino acids into three groups: (i) highly fluctuating-Gly, Ala, Ser, Pro, and Asp, (ii) moderately fluctuating-, Asn, Gln, , Glu, Arg, Val, and Cys, and (iii) weakly fluctuating-Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, , Trp, and His. The structural instability in proteins possibly relates to the high content of the highly fluctuating residues and a deficiency of the weakly fluctuating residues in irregular secondary structure elements (loops), chameleon sequences, and disordered proteins. Strong correlation between residue fluctuations and the sequence composition of protein loops supports this hypothesis. Comparing fluctuations of binding site residues (interface residues) with other surface residues shows that, on average, the interface is more rigid than the rest of the protein surface and Gly, Ala, Ser, Cys, Leu, and Trp have a propensity to form more stable docking patches on the interface. The findings have broad implications for understanding mechanisms of protein association and stability of protein structures.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22573843>Triennial Lactation Symposium: Mammary metabolism of amino acids in dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Although in dairy cows the mammary gland (MG) is the major net user of essential AA (EAA) supply, milk protein synthesis from absorbed EAA is not a straightforward process. Early studies identified 2 groups of EAA based on different pattern of mammary utilization: group 1 [Met, Phe (+), Trp], where MG uptake was similar to secretion in milk protein, and group 2 (Arg, Ile, Leu, , , and Val), where uptake exceeded milk protein output. This review examines the validity of this classification under variable protein supply through a meta-analysis, with the outcomes then explained with studies in which the fates of individual EAA were monitored using isotope approaches. For the meta-analysis, the Fick principle, based on stoichiometric transfer of Phe+ uptake to milk protein, was used to estimate mammary plasma flow across all studies. This approach was judged acceptable because doubling Phe supply did not result in mammary oxidation of Phe+ and either limited or no contribution of peptides to Phe and  mammary supply could be detected. The AA content of proteins synthesized by the MG was estimated from milk protein composition, and the uptake-to-output ratio (U:O) for individual AA was re-calculated based on these assumptions. Analysis of individual samples by isotopic dilution resulted in reduced variance compared with analysis on pooled samples performed with an AA analyzer. Globally, the U:O of His and Met is maintained close to unity under variable protein supply. The group 2 AA could be subdivided. First, the U:O for group "2v" AA (Ile, Leu, Val, and ) is greater than 1 and varied with protein supply. Accordingly, the increased U:O of Leu, induced by duodenal casein infusion, led to extra-mammary Leu oxidation. Decreasing  supply decreased  U:O and the associated transfer of N to non-EAA, mainly to Glx, Asx, Ser, and Ala. Second, the U:O of group "2nv" AA, Arg and , does not vary with protein supply. The Arg U:O averages 2.5, whereas the  U:O, albeit averaging 1.2, does not differ from unity. Excess of both these AA is probably directed toward the synthesis of non-EAA rather than  supply. Overall, the ability of the MG to use excess EAA-N supply offers alternative sources of N and C for  provision, lactose synthesis and non-EAA synthesis. The latter function spares dietary non-EAA for other necessary processes, such as gluconeogenesis and  supply, in other tissues to support lactation.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3307782>Pyridoxal 5'phosphate binding site of Escherichia coli beta cystathionase and cystathionine gamma synthase comparison of their sequences.</a></h2><p>The phosphopyridoxyl peptides of beta cystathionase and cystathionine gamma synthase of Escherichia Coli were identified after reduction, carboxymethylation and proteolysis of the holoenzymes.

Data on somatostatin receptor expression in follicular thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer has been limited and conflicting. This study seeks to characterize somatostatin receptor expression in follicular thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer and to assess the effects of somatostatin analogues.Anaplastic thyroid cancer (Hth7 and 8505C) and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC-236) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) cells were cultured. Capillary immunoblotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to determine the basal expression of protein and mRNA of SSTR1-SSTR5. Cells were treated with the somatostatin analogues octreotide, pasireotride (SOM230), and KE-108 for 48h. IC was determined via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and cell proliferation was measured by viable cell count. Presence of SSTR2 was assessed by immunohistochemistry.Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that most cell lines expressed SSTR1-SSTR3 and SSTR5 in varying degrees. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that mRNA expression for SSTR2 and SSTR3 correlated with protein expression. MTT assays showed that KE-108 and SOM230 were able to inhibit cell proliferation. Tissue microarray (TMA) showed that SSTR2 was highly expressed in human tissues of aggressive thyroid carcinomas.Follicular thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer express SSTR1-3 and SSTR5 in distinct fashions both at a message and protein level.

Existing CXMS chemical cross-linkers target only , Cys, Glu, and Asp residues, limiting the information measurable. Here we report a "plant-and-cast" cross-linking strategy that employs a heterobifunctional cross-linker that contains a highly reactive succinimide ester as well as a less reactive sulfonyl fluoride. The succinimide ester reacts rapidly with surface  residues "planting" the reagent at fixed locations on protein. The pendant aryl sulfonyl fluoride is then "cast" across a limited range of the protein surface, where it can react with multiple weakly nucleophilic amino acid sidechains in a proximity-enhanced sulfur-fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reaction. Using proteins of known structures, we demonstrated that the heterobifunctional agent formed cross-links between  residues and His, Ser, , , and  sidechains. This geometric specificity contrasts with current bis-succinimide esters, which often generate nonspecific cross-links between lysines brought into proximity by rare thermal fluctuations. Thus, the current method can provide diverse and robust distance restraints to guide integrative modeling. This work provides a chemical cross-linker targeting unactivated Ser, , His, and  residues using sulfonyl fluorides. In addition, this methodology yielded a variety of cross-links when applied to the complex  cell lysate. Finally, in combination with genetically encoded chemical cross-linking, cross-linking using this reagent markedly increased the identification of weak and transient enzyme-substrate interactions in live cells. Proximity-dependent cross-linking will dramatically expand the scope and power of CXMS for defining the identities and structures of protein complexes.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9271505>Functional effects on the acetylcholine receptor of multiple mutations of gamma Asp174 and delta Asp180.</a></h2><p>Residues gamma Asp174 and delta Asp180, previously implicated in the binding of acetylcholine (ACh) by the mouse muscle ACh receptor, were each mutated to nine other residues, Asn, Glu, , Ala, Cys, His, Val, , and . The effects of the mutations on ACh-induced current was determined on surface receptors containing wild-type alpha and beta subunits and mutant gamma and delta subunits. The mutations increased the concentration of ACh eliciting half-maximal current (EC50) by factors from 22 for the Glu mutant to 660 for the  mutant. Analysis of the effects in terms of the difference in the accessible surface areas of the mutant and wild-type side chains and the difference in side-chain charges indicated that, per binding site, Delta DeltaG0 for activation was a sum of 10 cal mol-1 A-2 of change in side-chain accessible surface area and of 0.95 kcal mol-1 positive step-1 in side-chain charge, equivalent to 1 mol of charge falling through 42 mV. The effects on the concentration of ACh (IC50, ACh) and of d-tubocurarine (IC50,dTC) causing half-maximal retardation of alpha-bungarotoxin binding were determined on complexes containing wild-type alpha and beta subunits and either mutant gamma or mutant delta subunit. The effects on IC50,ACh correlated well with the effects on EC50, with a similar magnitude for the influence of side-chain charge on the free  of binding (in this case to the desensitized state) and on the electrostatic potential at the binding site. The effects on IC50,dTC were in all cases less than the effects on IC50,ACh, and the two sets of effects were poorly correlated. In line with the higher ACh affinity and lower d-tubocurarine affinity of the alpha-delta binding site compared to the alpha-gamma binding site, mutations of delta Asp180 had a greater effect on IC50,ACh than did the same mutations of gamma Asp174, and vice versa for effects on IC50,dTC.

Patients with homocystinuria/homocysteinemia caused by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) deficiency suffer from thromboembolism and mental retardation from early ages; therefore, detection by newborn screening is performed. Furthermore, elevated levels of serum homocysteine during pregnancy are associated with the occurrence of neural tube defects (NTDs) in newborns. However, the causes of such central nervous system (CNS) defects are unknown. We found previously impaired learning abilities in Cbs-deficient (Cbs) mice (but not NTD births). Here, we investigated the amino acid profiles of serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from Cbs mice. Mice deficient in cystathionine γ-lyase (Cth), a downstream enzyme of CBS in transsulfuration, as well as wild-type mice, were analyzed as controls. Cbs and Cth mice were smaller than wild-type mice, and CSF yields in Cbs mice were lower than the others. CSF amino acid levels were generally lower than those in serum, and compared with the dramatic amino acid level alterations in Cbs mouse serum, alterations in CSF were less apparent. However, marked upregulation (versus wild-type) of aspartic acid/asparagine (Asp/Asn), glutamine (Gln), serine (Ser), threonine (), phenylalanine (Phe), tyrosine (), methionine (Met), total homocysteine, and citrulline, and downregulation of lysine () were found in Cbs mouse CSF. Because similar regulation of total homocysteine/citrulline/ was observed in the CSF of Cth mice, which are free of CNS dysfunction, the reduced CSF volumes and the level changes of other amino acids could be relevant to Cbs-specific CNS defects.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27271343>AGIA Tag System Based on a High Affinity Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody against Human Dopamine Receptor D1 for Protein Analysis.</a></h2><p>Polypeptide tag technology is widely used for protein detection and affinity purification. It consists of two fundamental elements: a peptide sequence and a binder which specifically binds to the peptide tag. In many tag systems, antibodies have been used as binder due to their high affinity and specificity. Recently, we obtained clone Ra48, a high-affinity rabbit monoclonal antibody (mAb) against dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1). Here, we report a novel tag system composed of Ra48 antibody and its epitope sequence. Using a deletion assay, we identified EEAAGIARP in the C-terminal region of DRD1 as the minimal epitope of Ra48 mAb, and we named this sequence the "AGIA" tag, based on its central sequence. The tag sequence does not include the four amino acids, Ser, , , or , which are susceptible to post-translational modification. We demonstrated performance of this new tag system in biochemical and cell biology applications. SPR analysis demonstrated that the affinity of the Ra48 mAb to the AGIA tag was 4.90 × 10-9 M. AGIA tag showed remarkably high sensitivity and specificity in immunoblotting. A number of AGIA-fused proteins overexpressed in animal and plant cells were detected by anti-AGIA antibody in immunoblotting and immunostaining with low background, and were immunoprecipitated efficiently. Furthermore, a single amino acid substitution of the second Glu to Asp (AGIA/E2D) enabled competitive dissociation of AGIA/E2D-tagged protein by adding wild-type AGIA peptide. It enabled one-step purification of AGIA/E2D-tagged recombinant proteins by peptide competition under physiological conditions.

To understand the interaction in protein-DNA complexes, the integrative study of binding and stabilizing residues is important. In the present study, we have identified key residues that play a dual role in both binding and stability from a nonredundant dataset of 319 protein-DNA complexes. We observed that key residues are identified in very less number of complexes (29%) and only about 4% of stabilizing/binding residues are identified as key residues. Specifically, stabilizing residues have higher preference to be key residues than binding residues. These key residues include polar, nonpolar, aliphatic, aromatic, and charged amino acids. Moreover, we have analyzed and discussed the key residues in different protein-DNA complexes, which are classified based on protein structural class, function, DNA strand, and their conformations. Especially, Ser, , , Arg, and  residues are commonly found in most of the subclasses of protein-DNA complexes. Further, we analyzed atomic contacts, which show that polar-nonpolar is more enriched than other types of contacts. In addition, the charged contacts are highly preferred in protein-DNA complexes compared with protein-protein and protein-RNA complexes. Finally, we have discussed the sequence and structural features of key residues such as conservation score, surrounding hydrophobicity, solvent accessibility, secondary structure, and long-range order.

Manganese exposure is considered to be an environmental risk factor connected to PD and PD-like syndrome. Research into the genetic and environmental risk factors involved in disease susceptibility has recently uncovered a link existing between Park9 and manganese. It seems that manganese binding to Park9 (YPk9) protein is involved in the detoxification mechanism exerted by this protein against manganese toxicity.

Presumably octahedral species, in which the Mn(II) ion was bound to oxygens of the carboxyl groups of Glu and Asp, and species where the involvement of sulfur from Cys and nitrogen from His residues, depending on the metal to ligand molar ratio, were detected for manganese coordination.

The studies presented in this paper, when compared with our previous results (Makowska et al., Spectrochim.

All the measurements were carried out in 20mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer solution, pH6.0. The Stern-Volmer equations, along with spectroscopic observations, were used to determine the quenching and binding parameters. The obtained results unequivocally suggest that Cu(2+) ions quench the fluorescence of HZ1 only through a static quenching mechanism, in contrast to the fragment from the N-terminal part of the FPB28 protein, with sequence Ac----Ala-Asp-Gly---- NH2 (D9) and its derivative with a single point mutation: Ac----Ala-Asn-Gly---- NH2 (D9_M), where dynamic quenching occurred. The thermodynamic parameters (ΔITCH, ΔITCS) for the interactions between Cu(2+) ions and the HZ1 peptide were determined from the calorimetric data.

Peptides were docked in triplicate to the N-terminal domain using docking program AutoDock Vina, and results were compared to those of ezetimibe, a prescribed NPC1L1 inhibitor. Three black bean peptides (-7.2 to -7.0kcal/mol) and the cowpea bean dipeptide -Asp (-7.0kcal/mol) had higher binding affinities than ezetimibe (-6.6kcal/mol) for the N-terminal domain of NPC1L1. Lentil and pea peptides studied did not have high binding affinities. The common bean peptide -Ala-Ala-Ala- (-7.2kcal/mol), which can be produced from black or navy bean proteins, had the highest binding affinity. Ezetimibe and peptides with high binding affinities for the N-terminal domain are expected to interact at different locations of the N-terminal domain. All high affinity black bean peptides are expected to have van der Waals interactions with SER130, PHE136, and LEU236 and a conventional hydrogen bond with GLU238 of NPC1L1.

There has been a recognizable pattern of mutations in the primary sequence of PLA2s that alter their catalytic properties significantly. In the present study, the amino acid sequence and the three-dimensional structure of a new isoform of PLA2 from crude venom of Indian cobra sub-species Naja naja sagittifera (N.n.s.) has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The crystal structure has revealed several novel features of PLA2 folding and function. It contains 913 protein atoms and one each of Ca2+, phosphate and acetate ions with 142 solvent water molecules. A Ca2+ ion is present in the calcium-binding loop and forms a seven-fold coordination with a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. One of the coordination linkages is with the acetate ion, instead of the conserved water molecule. The presence of  at position 31 has a stabilizing effect on the loop  25-Cys 29 by interacting with carbonyl  atoms of  25, Gly 26 and Cys 29. In turn, it lends stability to the Ca(2+)-binding loop as well. Another unique feature of the PLA2 structure is the formation of an intrastrand hydrogen bond, involving Ogamma of  73 and Oepsilon2 of Glu 71, thus helping the beta-wing to act as a sharp arrow for insertion into other molecules. Yet another important feature of this PLA2 pertains to the conformation of its C-terminal segment, which is stabilized by a unique hydrogen bond through carbonyl  of  116 and Ndelta2 of Asn 120. This structural feature may be useful in the molecular recognition of the PLA2 through C-terminal segment.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11710179>Synthesis and wettability characteristics of model adhesive protein sequences inspired by a marine mussel.</a></h2><p>Three adhesive polyoctapeptides (X/Y-Gly--Ser-Ala-Gly--)n (X,  and Ala: Y, :Ala = 3:2), which are the C-terminal octapeptide sequences shared by all those consensus motifs of a ribbed mussel Geukensia demissa adhesive protein (RMAP), have been synthesized by the polycondensation of the active esters. The correlation between wettability and adhesion with the alternative substitution by hydrophobic Ala and hydrophilic  in the synthetic RMAPs in aqueous solution and as films on high and low surface free  (sfe) surfaces has been investigated by surface chemical approaches. The side chain moieties of RMAPs arrange their local conformation to adapt to the inherent surface character, and they orientate on high and low sfe surfaces. On a high sfe glass the hydrophilic side chains of the RMAP molecules face toward the surface, and on a low sfe polyethylene (HDPE) the hydrophobic side chains face toward the surface. The bonding strengths of synthetic RMAPs on glass and HDPE with and without enzymatic oxidation have been examined. Increased starting concentration exhibited the strongest adhesive capability (7.5 kgf/cm2) on alumina due to the increased cohesion among RMAP molecules. As another factor to increase adhesive ability, the intermolecular cross-linking among RMAP molecules by tyrosinase increases their adhesive capability by about 20% on HDPE, glass, and alumina except iron.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23283232>Structural and functional characterization of an anesthetic binding site in the second cysteine-rich domain of protein kinase Cδ*.</a></h2><p>Elucidating the principles governing anesthetic-protein interactions requires structural determinations at high resolutions not yet achieved with ion channels. Protein kinase C (PKC) activity is modulated by general anesthetics. We solved the structure of the phorbol-binding domain (C1B) of PKCδ complexed with an ether (methoxymethylcycloprane) and with an alcohol (cyclopropylmethanol) at 1.36-Å resolution. The cyclopropane rings of both agents displace a single water molecule in a surface pocket adjacent to the phorbol-binding site, making van der Waals contacts with the backbone and/or side chains of residues Asn-237 to Ser-240. Surprisingly, two water molecules anchored in a hydrogen-bonded chain between -242 and -260 impart elasticity to one side of the binding pocket. The cyclopropane ring takes part in π-acceptor hydrogen bonds with the amide of Met-239. There is a crucial hydrogen bond between the  atoms of the anesthetics and the hydroxyl of -236. A -236-Phe mutation results in loss of binding. Thus, both van der Waals interactions and hydrogen-bonding are essential for binding to occur. Ethanol failed to bind because it is too short to benefit from both interactions. Cyclopropylmethanol inhibited phorbol-ester-induced PKCδ activity, but failed to do so in PKCδ containing the -236-Phe mutation.Copyright © 2012 Biophysical Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Its β subunit shares with Ib counterparts the requirements for manganese(II) and superoxide (O) for activation, but it does not require the O-supplying flavoprotein (NrdI) needed in Ib systems, instead scavenging the oxidant from solution. Although Fj β has tyrosine at the appropriate sequence position ( 104), this residue is not oxidized to a radical upon activation, as occurs in the Ia/b proteins. Rather, Fj β directly deploys an oxidized dimanganese cofactor for radical initiation. In treatment with one-electron reductants, the cofactor can undergo cooperative three-electron reduction to the II/II state, in contrast to the quantitative univalent reduction to inactive "met" (III/III) forms seen with I(a-c) βs. This tendency makes Fj β unusually robust, as the II/II form can readily be reactivated. The structure of the protein rationalizes its distinctive traits. A distortion in a core helix of the ferritin-like architecture renders the active site unusually open, introduces a cavity near the cofactor, and positions a subclass-d-specific  residue to shepherd O to the Mn cluster. Relative to the positions of the radical tyrosines in the Ia/b proteins, the unreactive  104 of Fj β is held away from the cofactor by a hydrogen bond with a subclass-d-specific  residue. Structural comparisons, considered with its uniquely simple mode of activation, suggest that the Id protein might most closely resemble the primordial RNR-β.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23139016>Multiple binding modes for palmitate to barley lipid transfer protein facilitated by the presence of proline 12.</a></h2><p>Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to characterise the binding of the fatty acid ligand palmitate in the barley lipid transfer protein 1 (LTP) internal cavity. Two different palmitate binding modes (1 and 2), with similar protein-ligand interaction energies, have been identified using a variety of simulation strategies. These strategies include applying experimental protein-ligand atom-atom distance restraints during the simulation, or protonating the palmitate ligand, or using the vacuum GROMOS 54B7 force-field parameter set for the ligand during the initial stages of the simulations. In both the binding modes identified the palmitate carboxylate head group hydrogen bonds with main chain amide groups in helix A, residues 4 to 19, of the protein. In binding mode 1 the hydrogen bonds are to  11, Cys 13, and Leu 14 and in binding mode 2 to  15,  16, Val 17, Ser 24 and also to the OH of  15. In both cases palmitate binding exploits irregularity of the intrahelical hydrogen-bonding pattern in helix A of barley LTP due to the presence of Pro 12. Simulations of two variants of barley LTP, namely the single mutant Pro12Val and the double mutant Pro12Val Pro70Val, show that Pro 12 is required for persistent palmitate binding in the LTP cavity. Overall, the work identifies key MD simulation approaches for characterizing the details of protein-ligand interactions in complexes where NMR data provide insufficient restraints.Copyright © 2012 The Protein Society.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24706971>Dietary electrolyte balance influences ileal endogenous amino acid losses in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of nitrogen-free diets formulated with 2 ratios of corn starch and dextrose and 2 levels of dietary electrolyte balance (DEB; calculated as Na + K - Cl(-), in mEq/kg of diet) on ileal endogenous amino acid (EAA) losses in 48-d-old broiler chickens.

Thus, the aim of this study was to apply the deletion method to derive the IAAR for broiler breeder hens. The nitrogen balance trials were performed from 31 to 35 weeks and from 46 to 50 weeks. Twelve treatments with eight replicates and one hen per cage were used. A balanced diet (BD) was formulated to meet the requirement of all nutrients. The other diets were formulated diluting 55% of BD with corn starch and refilled with amino acids (AAs) and other ingredients, except the AA tested. Each trial lasted 25 days. Feather losses, egg production and egg  were recorded daily, and the samples were stored to further determine NEM and nitrogen in feather losses (ND ). At the start and the end of each period, a group of birds were slaughtered to further determine ND and ND . The NR was calculated as the sum of ND , ND , ND , NEM and the nitrogen maintenance requirement (NMR). The deletion of valine greatly depressed the NR in peak production (31 to 35 weeks) while the deletion of the isoleucine greatly depressed the NR of the hens from 46 to 50 weeks of age.

Peptide backbone groups were found to be the most common second-shell ligand in Mg, Mn, Ca, and Zn binding sites, followed (in decreasing order) by Asp/Glu, /Arg, Asn/Gln, and Ser/ side chains. Aromatic - or nitrogen-containing side chains (, His, and Trp) and sulfur-containing side chains (Cys and Met) are seldom found in the second coordination layer. The backbone and Asn/Gln side chain are ubiquitous in the metal second coordination layer as their carbonyl  and amide hydrogen can act as a hydrogen-bond acceptor and donor, respectively, and can therefore partner practically every first-shell ligand. The second most common outer-shell ligand, Asp/Glu, predominantly hydrogen bonds to a metal-bound water or Zn-bound histidine and polarizes the H-O or H-N bond. In certain cases, a second-shell Asp/Glu could affect the protonation state of the metal ligand. It could also energetically stabilize a positively charged metal complex more than a neutral ligand such as the backbone and Asn/Gln side chain. As for the first shell, the second shell is predicted to contribute to the metal selectivity of the binding site by discriminating between metal cations of different ionic radii and coordination geometries. The first-shell-second-shell interaction energies decay rapidly with increasing solvent exposure of the metal binding site. They are less favorable but are of the same order of magnitude as compared to the respective metal-first-shell interaction energies. Altogether, the results indicate that the structure and properties of the second shell are dictated by those of the first layer. The outer shell is apparently designed to stabilize/protect the inner-shell and complement/enhance its properties.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566595>Effect of inclusion level of corn germ meal on the digestible and metabolizable  and evaluation of ileal AA digestibility of corn germ meal fed to growing pigs.</a></h2><p>Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of inclusion level of corn germ meal (CGM) on the DE and ME values of CGM and to evaluate the ileal AA digestibility of CGM fed to growing pigs. In Exp. 1, 42 barrows (63.8 ± 2.1 kg BW) were allotted to seven diets in a completely randomized design with six replicates per diet. Diets included a corn-soybean meal (SBM) diet and six additional diets containing 4.85%, 9.70%, 19.40%, 29.10%, 38.80%, or 48.50% CGM. Pigs were fed twice daily, at 0730 and 1630 hours, at a level of 4% of BW, and feces and urine were collected for 5 d. The apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, OM, CP, acid-hydrolyzed ether extract, and the DE and ME in diets linearly decreased (P < 0.01) as dietary CGM increased. Inclusion level of CGM had no effect on the DE and ME values of CGM. On a DM basis, the concentration of DE and ME varied from 3,396 to 3,747 kcal/kg and 3,107 to 3,502 kcal/kg, respectively. In Exp. 2, 11 crossbred barrows (30.4 ± 2.9 kg BW) with a T-cannula in the distal ileum were allotted to an 11 × 6 Youden square design with 11 diets and 6 period, which included an N-free diet and 10 CGM test diets. Chromic oxide (0.3%) was included in all diets as an indigestible marker. Pigs were fed daily at 4% of BW during each period, which consisted of 5 d of diet adaptation followed by 2 d of digesta collection. The apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of Ile, , and Ala and the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and Ile varied (P < 0.01) among the 10 CGM. The AID of CP and all AA except Pro and , and the SID of all AA except Pro were the greatest (P < 0.05) in sample 7. The AID and SID of CP averaged 40.47% and 64.75%, respectively, and varied from 32.30% to 54.87% and from 57.48% to 72.15%, respectively. The average SID of , Met, , and Trp was 65.61%, 76.15%, 65.29%, and 60.17%, respectively, with a SEM of 4.49, 2.40, 5.95, and 6.82, respectively. The average SID of Pro was 101.76%, with an SEM of 17.26. Increasing dietary CGM decreased the ATTD of nutrients, the DE and ME values of diets but CGM. The AID and SID of AA in CGM are low but source dependent, and CGM may be fed to pigs as an protein-rich feedstuff.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26877091>Critical POU domain residues confer Oct4 uniqueness in somatic cell reprogramming.</a></h2><p>The POU domain transcription factor Oct4 plays critical roles in self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Together with Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, Oct4 can reprogram any other cell types to pluripotency, in which Oct4 is the only factor that cannot be functionally replaced by other POU family members. To investigate the determinant elements of Oct4 uniqueness, we performed Ala scan on all Ser, , ,  and Arg of murine Oct4 by testing their capability in somatic cell reprogramming. We uncovered a series of residues that are important for Oct4 functionality, in which almost all of these key residues are within the POU domains making direct interaction with DNA. The Oct4 N- and C-terminal transactivation domains (TADs) are not unique and could be replaced by the Yes-associated protein (YAP) TAD domain to support reprogramming. More importantly, we uncovered two important residues that confer Oct4 uniqueness in somatic cell reprogramming. Our systematic structure-function analyses bring novel mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of how critical residues function together to confer Oct4 uniqueness among POU family for somatic cell reprogramming.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26170631>Adaptive evolution and elucidating the potential inhibitor against schizophrenia to target DAOA (G72) isoforms.</a></h2><p>Schizophrenia (SZ), a chronic mental and heritable disorder characterized by neurophysiological impairment and neuropsychological abnormalities, is strongly associated with D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA, G72). Research studies emphasized that overexpression of DAOA may be responsible for improper functioning of neurotransmitters, resulting in neurological disorders like SZ. In the present study, a hybrid approach of comparative modeling and molecular docking followed by inhibitor identification and structure modeling was employed. Screening was performed by two-dimensional similarity search against selected inhibitor, keeping in view the physiochemical properties of the inhibitor. Here, we report an inhibitor compound which showed maximum binding affinity against four selected isoforms of DAOA. Docking studies revealed that Glu-53, -54, -58, Val-85, Ser-86, -87, Leu-88, Glu-90, Leu-95, Val-98, Ser-100, Glu-112, -116, -120, Asp-121, and Arg-122 are critical residues for receptor-ligand interaction. The C-terminal of selected isoforms is conserved, and binding was observed on the conserved region of isoforms. We propose that selected inhibitor might be more potent on the basis of binding energy values. Further analysis of this inhibitor through site-directed mutagenesis could be helpful for exploring the details of ligand-binding pockets. Overall, the findings of this study may be helpful in designing novel therapeutic targets to cure SZ.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2877919>Characterization of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) islet somatostatins.</a></h2><p>Three different somatostatins have been isolated from the pancreatic islet tissue of the coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) by gel filtration and HPLC. Two of these peptides contain 14 amino acids and the larger third peptide consists of 25 amino acids. The sequence of the salmon SST-25 is Ser-Val-Asp-Asn-Leu-Pro-Pro-Arg-Glu-Arg--Ala-Gly -Cys--Asn-Phe--Trp--Gly-Phe--Ser-Cys. The sequence of the salmon SST-14-I is Ala-Gly-Cys--Asn-Phe-Phe-Trp---Phe--Ser-Cys. The other small somatostatin (SST-14-II) which was not sequenced has an amino acid composition identical to the C-terminal 14 amino acids of the SST-25 and it is probably derived from this larger form. Evidence for low levels of a somatostatin containing 28 amino acids is also presented. This SST-28 appears to be an N-terminal extended precursor of SST-25 or a peptide derived via alternative processing of a common preprosomatostatin. Injected into juvenile salmon, SST-25 caused a decline in circulating levels of plasma insulin, depletion of liver glycogen, and activation of lipolytic pathways.

Twenty-two growing barrows (25.5 ± 1.73 kg) were fitted with a T-cannula near the distal ileum and allotted to a 22 × 8 Youden square design. Twenty-two sources of SBM were procured from soybean crushing plants located throughout the United States. For analysis, the crushing plant locations were separated into the following 3 zones: 1) Michigan, Minnesota, and South Dakota ( = 4); 2) Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio ( = 11); and 3) Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska ( = 7). Dietary treatments included 22 diets based on a mixture of cornstarch, sucrose, and each source of SBM as the sole source of CP. Results indicated that the concentration of most indispensable and dispensable AA in SBM were not different among zones. However, SBM from zone 2 had a greater ( < 0.05) concentration of  than SBM from zone 3 and a greater ( < 0.05) concentration of Gly than SBM from zone 1. The concentration of  in SBM from zone 2 was also greater ( < 0.05) than in SBM from zones 1 and 3. However, if concentrations of AA were calculated as a percent of CP, there were no differences in the concentrations of indispensable and dispensable AA among SBM from the 3 zones. Likewise, the AID of CP and the AID of indispensable and dispensable AA were not different among SBM from the 3 zones. The SID of CP and most AA was also not different among SBM from the 3 zones. However, SBM from zone 3 had a greater ( < 0.05) SID of His, Asp, and Cys than SBM from zone 2, and SBM from zone 1 had a greater ( < 0.05) SID of  than SBM from zone 2. There was also a tendency ( < 0.10) for SBM from zone 3 to have a greater SID of Ile, Leu, Phe, Val, Ala, and  than SBM from zone 2. If the concentrations of SID CP and AA were calculated as grams per kilogram, SBM among the 3 zones were not different with the exception that there was a tendency ( = 0.07) for SBM from zone 2 to contain more SID  and SID  than SBM from zone 3. In conclusion, only a few differences in concentrations and digestibility of CP and AA exist among sources of SBM from different zones in the United States.

Without prior isolation, the structural determination is achieved on the basis of mass fragmentation pattern and comparison with the previously established data. The ESI-MS of the fraction in the positive ion mode gave clusters of singly and doubly charged molecular ion peaks. The ESI-MS spectrum showed peaks for the presence of the peptides kahalalides F, G, R and S reported earlier. In addition, it also showed molecular ion peaks at m/z 1557.8 [M+H] and doubly charged ions at m/z 779.4 [M+2H], 790.4 [M+Na] and 796.4 [M+K]. The MS/MS at m/z 779.4 [M+2H] at collision  40 V obtained series of b and y fragment ions. The MS/MS spectrum showed identical fragment ion y at m/z 643 which revealed that cyclic part is identical with kahalalide F, R and S. Careful examination of the fragment ions b to b with their corresponding y fragment ions y to y, respectively and by comparison of MS/MS pattern of kahalalide S, established that proline can be replaced by tyrosine amino acid residue. The mass difference between b ( m/z 511) and b ( m/z 674) is equal to 163 which is equivalent to mass residue of tyrosine. Their y fragment ions also quickly helped in fixing the puzzle.

The functions of protein-RNA complexes are dictated by their interactions, binding, stability, and affinity. In this work, we have identified the key residues (KRs), which are involved in both stability and binding. We found that 42 percent of considered proteins share common binding and stabilizing residues, whereas these residues are distinct in 58 percent of the proteins. Overall, 5 percent of stabilizing and 3 percent of binding residues serve as key residues. These residues are enriched with the combination of polar, charged, aliphatic, and aromatic residues. Analysis on subclasses of protein-RNA complexes based on protein structural class, function and RNA type showed that regulatory proteins, and complexes with single stranded RNA and rRNA have appreciable number of key residues. Specifically, Arg, , and  are preferred in most of the subclasses of protein-RNA complexes. In addition, residues with similar chemical behavior have different preferences to be KRs, such that Arg, , Val, and  are preferred over , Trp, Ile, and Ser, respectively. Atomic level contacts revealed that charged and polar-nonpolar contacts are dominant in enzymes, polar in structural, and nonpolar in regulatory proteins. On the other hand, polar-nonpolar contacts are enriched in all these classes of protein-RNA complexes. Further, the influence of sequence and structural features such as conservation score, surrounding hydrophobicity, solvent accessibility, secondary structure, and long-range order in key residues are also discussed.

The structure of PCNA from Leishmania donovani (LdPCNA) has been determined at 2.73Å resolution. Structure consists of six crystallographically independent molecules which form two trimeric rings. The pore diameter of the individual trimeric ring is of the order of 37Å. The two rings are stacked through their front to front faces. In order to gain a stable packing, the rings are rotated by 42° about the pore axis and shifted by 7Å and tilted by 16° along the perpendicular direction to pore axis. This form of stacking reduced the effective diameter of the pore to 32Å. The sequence of LdPCNA consists of a long segment of 41 amino acid residues (186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg-Ser---Ser-Glu-Val--Ala-Glu-Val--Ala-Glu-Ala-Arg-Asp-Asp-Asp-Glu-Glu-Pro-Leu-Ser-Arg---Gly--Ala-Asp-Ser-Ser-Ala-Asn-Ala-Ile-226) whereas the corresponding segments in other PCNAs contain only eight residues corresponding to 186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg------224-Asn-Ala-Ile-226.

Two of those are reported in this paper. In Hb Villeparisis, the beta 77 (EF1) His--> mutation is identical to that of Hb Fukuyama while the other mutation, beta 80 (EF4) Asn-->Ser, has not yet been described. These 2 abnormalities are located almost within interacting distance. They lead to decreased  affinity and, according to molecular simulations, to a remodeling of the surface of the molecule. Hb Corbeil associates 2 substitutions, that of Hb E [beta 26 (B8) Glu-->], and of Hb Sherwood Forest [beta 104 (G6) Arg-->], which are far from one another. The resulting properties consist only in the additive effects of both abnormalities. Hb Corbeil is, thus, a thalassemic Hb, like Hb E, and a molecule having altered  binding properties, characterized by decreased heterotropic effects, similar to those of Hb Sherwood Forest. The simultaneous presence of more than 1 structural abnormality leads to a large spectrum of possible consequences on the function of the molecule, from local effects to a perturbation of intermolecular interactions. The genetic mechanism resulting in Hb with more than 1 point mutation is discussed: in some cases it is very likely that the second mutation arose on a chromosome already carrying a point mutation, in contrast a single mutational event involving a micro gene conversion has been proposed in other cases.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26454172>Crystal structure analysis of a bacterial aryl acylamidase belonging to the amidase signature enzyme family.</a></h2><p>The atomic structure of a bacterial aryl acylamidase (EC 3.5.1.13; AAA) is reported and structural features are investigated to better understand the catalytic profile of this enzyme. Structures of AAA were determined in its native form and in complex with the analgesic acetanilide, p-acetaminophenol, at 1.70 Å and 1.73 Å resolutions, respectively. The overall structural fold of AAA was identified as an α/β fold class, exhibiting an open twisted β-sheet core surrounded by α-helices. The asymmetric unit contains one AAA molecule and the monomeric form is functionally active. The core structure enclosing the signature sequence region, including the canonical Ser-cisSer- catalytic triad, is conserved in all members of the Amidase Signature enzyme family. The structure of AAA in a complex with its ligand reveals a unique organization in the substrate-binding pocket. The binding pocket consists of two loops (loop1 and loop2) in the amidase signature sequence and one helix (α10) in the non-amidase signature sequence. We identified two residues ((136) and (330)) that interact with the ligand via water molecules, and a hydrogen-bonding network that explains the catalytic affinity over various aryl acyl compounds. The optimum activity of AAA at pH > 10 suggests that the reaction mechanism employs (84) as the catalytic base to polarize the Ser(187) nucleophile in the catalytic triad.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Adding extra protein-bound or free AA to the diet may correct the reduced AA intake of HS pigs. However, extra protein-bound AA may further increase the body heat load, whereas extra free AA does not affect the heat load of HS pigs. Two experiments were conducted. In Exp. 1, the performance depression because of HS, compared with thermal neutrality, was determined with 30 pigs (31.1 ± 1.2 kg BW) fed diets with AA only as protein or as a mix of protein and free AA. Heat stress pigs consumed 18 to 25% less  and  than thermal neutral. In Exp. 2, the effect of extra dietary protein-bound or free AA on performance and serum concentration of AA in 25 HS pigs (33.6 ± 0.65 kg BW) was evaluated. Treatments were as follows: CON, wheat-soybean meal-free --Met diet; xP diet, 26% more protein than the CON diet; xAA diet, 24% or more of each AA than the recommended level. Pigs were fed ad libitum. Blood samples were collected between 1600 and 1700 h, when pigs were exposed to the highest ambient temperature (around 41.3 °C). Body temperature ranged daily from 39.9 to 41.1 °C. The performance data were reported already. Pigs fed the xP diet consumed more of all indispensable AA and dispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05), and more Arg, Ile, Asp, Glu, Gly, and Ser (P < 0.05) than the xAA pigs. Except for Arg, xAA pigs consumed more indispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Arg, His, , Phe, , Trp, and Val, was higher (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Except for Ile serum, indispensable AA were higher in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Ile, Leu, , and Val were higher (P < 0.05), and Met tended to be higher (P < 0.10) in xAA than in xP pigs. The difference of Ile, Leu, Met, , and Val between the CON and the xAA pigs was larger than that between the CON and the xP pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Asn and  were higher, and Cys and Glu were lower (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Serum Cys tended to be lower in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.10). Asp and Glu were higher (P < 0.05) in xAA pigs than in xP pigs. In conclusion, these serum AA results combined with the reported performance data indicate that extra free AA in diets for HS pigs may help to correct the reduced AA availability and performance of HS pigs, although higher levels of specific AA such as Ile and Met might be needed.© The Author(s) 2019.

Each diet was provided at three different levels of FI. Feed intake level 1 was equal to the estimated  requirement for maintenance of the pigs, whereas levels 2 and 3 were two or three times this amount, respectively. Each experimental period lasted 7 d. The initial 4 d of each period comprised an adaptation period to the experimental diets. On d 5, fecal samples were collected, while ileal digesta were collected during two 10-h periods on d 6 and 7.

The AA composition (% of CP) of endogenous protein was not affected by the level of FI, except for Arg, , Pro, and Ser. As FI increased, the SID decreased linearly (P < 0.04) for CP and all AA, except Arg, Trp, Asp, Pro, and . The total-tract digestibility of  was not influenced by the FI level. These results demonstrate that the FI level significantly influenced AID, SID, and IAA(end) for CP and AA. Therefore, pigs used to measure AA digestibility coefficients and IAA(end) should be fed at a level that is close to what is used under commercial conditions.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14691219>Effect of the N3 residue on the stability of the alpha-helix.</a></h2><p>N3 is the third position from the N terminus in the alpha-helix with helical backbone dihedral angles. All 20 amino acids have been placed in the N3 position of a synthetic helical peptide (CH(3)CO-[AAX AAAAKAAAAKAGY]-NH(2)) and the helix content measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy at 273 K. The dependence of peptide helicity on N3 residue identity has been used to determine a free  scale by analysis with a modified Lifson-Roig helix coil theory that includes a parameter for the N3  (n3). The most stabilizing residues at N3 in rank order are Ala, Glu, Met/Ile, Leu, , Ser, Gln, , , Phe, Asp, His, and Trp. Free energies for the most destabilizing residues (Cys, Gly, Asn, Arg, and Pro) could not be fitted. The results correlate with N1, N2, and helix interior energies and not at all with N-cap preferences. This completes our work on studying the structural and energetic preferences of the amino acids for the N-terminal positions of the alpha-helix.

Here we gained new insights to the TopIB mechanism through "chemical mutagenesis." Meta-substituted analogs of (274) were introduced by in vitro translation in the presence of a chemically misacylated tRNA. We report that a meta-OH reduced the rate of DNA cleavage 130-fold without affecting the rate of religation. By contrast, meta-OCH(3) and NO(2) groups elicited only a 6-fold decrement in cleavage rate. We propose that the meta-OH uniquely suppresses deprotonation of the para-OH nucleophile during the cleavage step. Assembly of the vaccinia TopIB active site is triggered by protein contacts with a specific DNA sequence 5'-C(+5)C(+4)C(+3)T(+2)T(+1)p downward arrowN (where downward arrow denotes the cleavage site). A signature alpha-helix of the poxvirus TopIB ((132)GKMKYLKENETVG(144)) engages the target site in the major groove and thereby recruits catalytic residue Arg(130) to the active site. The effects of 11 missense mutations at (136) highlight the importance of van der Waals interactions with the 3'-G(+4)pG(+3)p dinucleotide of the nonscissile strand for DNA cleavage and supercoil relaxation. Asn(140) and (142) donate hydrogen bonds to the pro-(S(p))- of the G(+3)pA(+2) phosphodiester of the nonscissile strand. (133) and (135) interact with purine nucleobases in the major groove. Whereas none of these side chains is essential per se, an N140A/T142A double mutation reduces the rate of supercoil relaxation and DNA cleavage by 120- and 30-fold, respectively, and a K133A/K135A double mutation slows relaxation and cleavage by 120- and 35-fold, respectively.

Sites 44 and 131 in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme.</a></h2><p>To determine the effects of different amino acids on the structure and stability of an alpha-helix in the context of a globular protein, all 19 naturally-occurring amino acids were substituted for Ser44 in phage T4 lysozyme. A more restricted set of nine replacements was also made for Val131. Ser44 and Val131 are two of a very limited number of possible sites in T4 lysozyme that are well within alpha-helices, are solvent-exposed and relatively free of interactions with neighboring residues, and are not involved in crystal contacts. High resolution structures for the majority of the mutants, some of which crystallized non-isomorphously with wild-type, were determined. With the exception of proline, the amino acid substitutions caused little if any perturbation of the alpha-helix backbone. Also the beta-branched residues , Val and Ile show no indication of either side-chain or backbone distortion. Therefore, other than proline, there is no evidence that differences in helix propensities are associated with different amounts of strain introduced into the helix. For reference, and also to allow estimates of side-chain entropy, a survey was made of side-chain conformations in 100 well-refined protein structures. As noted previously all side-chains within alpha-helices strongly avoid the g- conformation (chi 1 approximately 60 degrees). This restricts the beta-branched residues , Val and Ile to a single conformer (g+, chi 1 approximately -60 degrees). Asp, Asn, Met and Ser within helices also overwhelmingly prefer the g+ conformation. For Arg, Cys, Gln, Glu, Leu and  the t (chi 1 approximately 180 degrees) and g+ conformers are populated roughly equally. Only the aromatic residues, His, , Trp and Phe prefer the t conformation. These preferences are the same whether the side-chain is buried or solvent-exposed. In general, the side-chain conformations adopted by the residues substituted at positions 44 and 131 correspond to the most commonly observed conformation for the same amino acid in helices in known protein structures. The changes in protein stability for the replacements at site 131 in general agree well with those at site 44 (correlation r = 0.97), suggesting that these may be representative of substitutions at fully solvent-exposed sites in the middle of alpha-helices. The free  values also agree quite well with those observed for equivalent replacements in a number of soluble alpha-helical model peptides and with data from "host-guest" studies and statistical surveys (r = 0.69 to 0.93).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29667555>Synthesis, Cytotoxicity and Antioxidant Activity of New Analogs of RC-121 Synthetic Derivatives of Somatostatin.</a></h2><p>Based on the structure of RC-121 (D-Phe-c (Cys--D-Trp--Val-Cys)--NH2, - synthetic derivatives of somatostatin), some analogs were synthesized and tested for in vitro cytotoxic and antioxidant activity.The new analogs were modifyed at position 5 with Dap (diaminopropanoic acid), Dab (diaminobutanoic acid) and Orn and at position 6 with the unnatural amino acids Tle (t-leucine).The in vitro cytotoxic effects of the substances were investigated against a panel of human tumor cell lines HT-29 (Human Colorectal Cancer Cell Line), MDA-MB-23 (Human Breast Cancer Cell Line), Hep G-2 (Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell Line) and HeLa (cervical cancer cell line).

Comparison with other activated receiver domains.</a></h2><p>The crystal structure of BeF(3)(-)-activated CheY, with manganese in the magnesium binding site, was determined at 2.4-A resolution. BeF(3)(-) bonds to Asp(57), the normal site of phosphorylation, forming a hydrogen bond and salt bridge with (87) and (109), respectively. The six coordination sites for manganese are satisfied by a fluorine of BeF(3)(-), the side chain oxygens of Asp(13) and Asp(57), the carbonyl  of Asn(59), and two water molecules. All of the active site interactions seen for BeF(3)(-)-CheY are also observed in P-Spo0A(r). Thus, BeF(3)(-) activates CheY as well as other receiver domains by mimicking both the tetrahedral geometry and electrostatic potential of a phosphoryl group. The aromatic ring of (106) is found buried within a hydrophobic pocket formed by beta-strand beta4 and helix H4. The tyrosine side chain is stabilized in this conformation by a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and the backbone carbonyl  of Glu(89). This hydrogen bond appears to stabilize the active conformation of the beta4/H4 loop. Comparison of the backbone coordinates for the active and inactive states of CheY reveals that only modest changes occur upon activation, except in the loops, with the largest changes occurring in the beta4/H4 loop. This region is known to be conformationally flexible in inactive CheY and is part of the surface used by activated CheY for binding its target, FliM. The pattern of activation-induced backbone coordinate changes is similar to that seen in FixJ(r). A common feature in the active sites of BeF(3)(-)-CheY, P-Spo0A(r), P-FixJ(r), and phosphono-CheY is a salt bridge between (109) Nzeta and the phosphate or its equivalent, beryllofluoride. This suggests that, in addition to the concerted movements of (87) and (106) (- coupling), formation of the (109)-PO(3)(-) salt bridge is directly involved in the activation of receiver domains generally.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25679092>Optimization and validation of a chiral GC-MS method for the determination of free D-amino acids ratio in human urine: application to a gestational diabetes mellitus study.</a></h2><p>Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. It is affecting approximately up to 14% of all pregnancies with an increasing tendency. GDM has been related to relevant short-term and long-term health complications for both mother and offspring. Recent studies strongly emphasized the role of several essential amino acids in the pathogenesis of obesity and highlighted their strong correlation with insulin resistance, but there are no references related to modifications in D-AAs in biological fluids. As D-AA elimination proceeds mainly by renal excretion, urine was the selected sample to evaluate the alterations in free D-AAs ratio in a GDM study. Only 1 mL of first void urine or standard solution was required for purification, by using a Discovery DSC-SCX SPE cartridge (500 mg/3 mL) and derivatization into their N(O)-pentafluoropropionyl amino acid 2-propyl esters. Enantiomeric separation was carried out by GC-MS on a Chirasil-L-Val N-propionyl-L-valine-tert-butylamide polysiloxane fused-silica capillary column (25 m×0.25 mm I.D., 0.12 μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany), under programmed temperature elution. Detection was performed with an ion trap mass analyzer, operating in the full scan mode in the m/z 50-350 range. 14 pairs of derivatives of D-and L-AAs were separated. The steps of sample preparation, derivatization and GC-MS conditions were optimized for both urine and standards. Several conditions affecting the SPE procedure, such as sorbent mass/volume ratio of the cartridge, sample dilution and pH, were optimized. Volume of reagents and solvents and reaction temperature and time were also tested for the derivatization. Regarding the GC-MS parameters, split ratio, temperature program and mass range were optimized. The final method was validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, accuracy and precision for D-Ala, D-Pro, D-Ser, D-Met, D-Phe, D-Glu, D-Orn and D-. Identification of AAs in urine samples was based on retention time and mass spectra. Urine from 20 women with GDM and 20 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (after 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test), matched according to the week of gestation and age (22-28 week of gestation and age 24-37 years), were enrolled into the study. %D-Relative amounts were determined for Ala, Val, , Ser, Leu, Asx (Asp+Asn), Glx (Glu+Gln), Met, Phe, , Orn and . Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were observed only for D-Phe and higher values were found in the GDM group.

Eight barrows with an initial BW of 34.6 kg (SD 2.1) were individually fitted with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and randomly allotted to a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 4 diets and 4 periods per square. Three diets contained corn, soybean meal (SBM), or distiller's dried grains with solubles (DDGS) as the sole source of CP. An N-free diet was also prepared. All diets contained 0.5% chromic oxide as an indigestible marker. Equal meals were provided at 0800 and 2000 h. Ileal digesta samples were collected in 2-h intervals from 0800 to 2000 h during the last 3 d of each 7-d period. When pigs were fed the corn diet, the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of most indispensable AA and dispensable AA increased and then decreased (quadratic, < 0.05) during each of the six 2-h periods. The SID of most AA were less ( < 0.05) if the ileal digesta samples were collected from 1800 to 2000 h or from 1600 to 2000 h compared with the SID values from the ileal samples collected over the entire 12-h period. When pigs were fed the SBM diet, the SID of Ile, Leu, , Trp, Val, Ala, and Cys increased and then decreased (quadratic, < 0.05) but the SID of all other AA linearly decreased ( < 0.05) during the six 2-h periods. The SID of almost all AA were greater ( < 0.05) if the ileal samples were collected from 0800 to 1000 h, from 0800 to 1200 h, from 1000 to 1400 h, or from 0800 to 1400 h but less ( < 0.05) if collected from 1600 to 1800 h, from 1800 to 2000 h, from 1600 to 2000 h, or from 1400 to 2000 h compared with the SID values from the ileal samples collected over the entire 12-h period. When pigs were fed the DDGS-based diet, the SID of Ile, Leu, , Phe, Trp, Val, and  increased and then decreased (quadratic, < 0.05) during the six 2-h periods. The SID of most AA were less ( < 0.05) if the ileal samples were collected from 1800 to 2000 h compared with the SID values from the ileal samples collected over the entire 12-h period. In conclusion, diurnal variations in SID of AA in pigs indicate that 6 h of ileal sample collection starting 4 or 6 h after feeding may provide representative samples of ileal digesta from pigs fed different types of diets.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26789775>Synthesis, Characterization, and In Vitro Evaluation of New (99m)Tc/Re(V)-Cyclized Octreotide Analogues: An Experimental and Computational Approach.</a></h2><p>Radiolabeled proteolytic degradation-resistant somatostatin analogues have been of long-standing interest as cancer imaging and radiotherapy agents for targeting somatostatin receptor-positive tumors. Our interest in developing (186)Re- and (188)Re-based therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals led to investigation of a new Re(V)-cyclized octreotide analogue, Re(V)-cyclized, thiolated-DPhe(1)-Cys(2)-(3)-DTrp(4)-(5)-(6)-Cys(7)-(OH)(8) (Re-SDPhe-TATE) using both experimental and quantum chemical methods. The metal is directly coordinated to SDPhe-TATE through cyclization of the peptide around the [ReO](3+) core. Upon complexation, four isomers were observed; the isolated/semi-isolated isomers exhibited different somatostatin receptor (sstr) binding affinities, 0.13 to 1.5 μM, in rat pancreatic tumor cells. Two-dimensional NMR experiments and electronic structure calculations were employed to elucidate the structural differences among the different isomers. According to NMR studies, the metal is coordinated to three thiolates and the backbone amide of Cys(2) in isomers 1 and 4, whereas the metal is coordinated to three thiolates and the backbone amide of (3) in isomer 2. Quantum chemical methods clarified the stereochemistry of Re-SDPhe-TATE and the possible peptide arrangements around the [ReO](3+) core.

While resonances of most Phe,  and Trp residues were unshifted by the substrate dTdA from those found in the enzyme-La(3+)-3',5'-pdTp complex and the enzyme-Ca(2+)-3',5'-pdTp complex, proton resonances of -85, -113, -115, and Phe-34 were shifted by 0.08 to 0.33 ppm and the 15N resonance of -113 was shifted by 2.1 ppm by the presence of substrate. The optimized position of enzyme-bound dTdA shows the 5'-dA leaving group to partially overlap the inhibitor, 3',5'-pdTp (in the X-ray structure). The 3'-TMP moiety of dTdA points toward the solvent in a channel defined by Ile-18, Asp-19, -22, -45, and His-46. The phosphate of dTdA is coordinated by the metal, and an adjacent inner sphere water ligand is positioned to donate a hydrogen bond to the general base Glu-43 and to attack the phosphorus with inversion.

To dissect the central  activity of S. suis under different conditions of nutrient availability, we performed labeling experiments starting from [(13)C]glucose specimens and analyzed the resulting isotopologue patterns in amino acids of S. suis grown under in vitro and ex vivo conditions. In combination with classical growth experiments, we found that S. suis is auxotrophic for Arg, Gln/Glu, His, Leu, and Trp in chemically defined medium. De novo biosynthesis was shown for Ala, Asp, Ser, and  at high rates and for Gly, , Phe, , and Val at moderate or low rates, respectively. Glucose degradation occurred mainly by glycolysis and to a minor extent by the pentose phosphate pathway. Furthermore, the exclusive formation of oxaloacetate by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylation became evident from the patterns in de novo synthesized amino acids. Labeling experiments with S. suis grown ex vivo in blood or cerebrospinal fluid reflected the  adaptation to these host niches with different nutrient availability; however, similar key  activities were identified under these conditions.

An important improvement in recent years was the introduction of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with radiolabeled sstr agonists, such as [Y-DOTA,]octreotide or [Lu-DOTA,]octreotide (Y- or Lu-DOTATOC, respectively) and [Lu-DOTA,]octreotate (Lu-DOTATATE). PET/CT with Ga-labeled sstr agonists, such as Ga-DOTATOC, Ga-DOTATATE, and [Ga-DOTA,1-Nal]octreotide (Ga-DOTANOC), plays an important role in staging and restaging neuroendocrine tumors. Most importantly, sstr scintigraphy and sstr PET/CT can distinguish patients who will qualify for and benefit from peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. This characteristic of sstr targeting is important because it allows a personalized treatment approach (theranostic approach). Until recently, it was thought that internalization of the radiolabeled agonist was mandatory for sstr-mediated imaging and therapy. It was Ginj et al. who proposed in 2006 the paradigm shift that radiolabeled sstr antagonists may perform better than agonists despite the lack of internalization. Despite the rather limited number of head-to-head comparisons of sstr antagonists and agonists, the superiority of sstr antagonists was demonstrated in several cases. From a small library of sstr antagonists, the analog JR11 (Cpa-c[d-Cys-Aph(Hor)-d-Aph(Cbm)---Cys]-d--NH), an antagonist with selectivity for sstr subtype 2, showed the best overall characteristics for sstr subtype 2 targeting and was therefore selected for clinical translation. JR11 is under clinical development as a PET imaging agent when labeled with Ga (Ga-NODAGA-JR11 or Ga-OPS202) and as a therapeutic agent when labeled with Lu (Lu-DOTA-JR11 or Lu-OPS201).

The protein also known as the polyphenolic protein is produced and stored in the exocrine phenol gland of the mussel and deposited onto marine surfaces by the animal's foot during the formation of new adhesive plaques. The adhesive protein has been purified by a combination of ion exchange on sulfonylpropyl-Sephadex and gel filtration on low surface  chromatographic media. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the protein at acidic pH shows it to consist of two components having a molecular weight of about 130,000. Treatment of the protein with clostridial collagenase reduced the molecular weight by less than 10%. The collagenase-resistant fragment contains most or all of the Hyp and Dopa. Trypsin treatment of the polyphenolic protein results in extensive degradation. The major tryptic peptide (80%) contains 10 amino acids including Hyp and Dopa and was shown by sequence analysis to be H2N-Ala--Pro-Ser--Hyp-Hyp--Dopa--COOH. Calculations suggest that this and related sequences may be repeated as often as 75 times in the polyphenolic protein.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3227015>Polar hydrogen positions in proteins: empirical  placement and neutron diffraction comparison.</a></h2><p>A method for the prediction of hydrogen positions in proteins is presented. The method is based on the knowledge of the heavy atom positions obtained, for instance, from X-ray crystallography. It employs an  minimization limited to the environment of the hydrogen atoms bound to a common heavy atom or to a single water molecule. The method is not restricted to proteins and can be applied without modification to nonpolar hydrogens and to nucleic acids. The method has been applied to the neutron diffraction structures of trypsin, ribonuclease A, and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. A comparison of the constructed and the observed hydrogen positions shows few deviations except in situations in which several energetically similar conformations are possible.

In particular, we report model complexes of the general formula fac-[M(L)(CO)] (M = Re, Tc, Re) where L denotes NOTA-Pyr (1) or NODAGA-Pyr (2), which are derived from conjugation of NOTA/NODAGA with pyrrolidine (Pyr). Further, as proof-of-principle, we synthesized the peptide bioconjugate NODAGA-sst-ANT (3) and explored its complexation with the fac-[Re(CO)] and fac-[Tc][Tc(CO)] cores; sst-ANT denotes the somatostatin receptor (SSTR) antagonist 4-NO-Phe-c(DCys--DTrp---Cys)-DTyr-NH. Rhenium complexes Re-1 through Re-3 were synthesized and characterized spectroscopically, and receptor binding affinity was demonstrated for Re-3 in SSTR-expressing cells (AR42J, IC = 91 nM). Radiolabeled complexes [Tc]Tc/[Re]Re-1/2 and [Tc]Tc-3 were prepared in high radiochemical yield (>90%, determined by radio-HPLC) by reacting [Tc]/[Re][Tc/Re(OH)(CO)] with 1-3 and correlated well with the respective Re-1 through Re-3 standards in comparative HPLC studies. All radiotracers remained intact through 24 h (Tc-labeled complexes) or 48 h (Re-labeled complexes) against 1 mM l-histidine and 1 mM l-cysteine (pH 7.4, 37 °C). Similarly, rat serum stability studies displayed no decomposition and low nonspecific binding of 9-24% through 4 h. Biodistribution of [Tc]Tc-3 in healthy CF-1 mice demonstrated a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Rapid clearance was observed within 1 h post-injection, predominantly via the renal system (82% of the injected dose was excreted in urine by 1 h), with low kidney retention (% ID/g: 11 at 1 h, 5 at 4 h, and 1 at 24 h) and low nonspecific uptake in other organs/tissues.

The purification steps consisted of (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, Blue Sepharose affinity chromatography and gel filtration. A typical procedure provided 685-fold purification with 58% yield. The Mr of the holoenzyme was estimated to be 322,000 by gel filtration and 316,000 by ultracentrifugation. The enzyme migrated as a single polypeptide spot on two-dimensional polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis with an Mr of 38,500, suggesting that the holoenzyme consists of eight identical subunits. This is the first case where malate dehydrogenase has been shown to be a homo-octamer; malate dehydrogenases from other sources are predominantly homodimers, with two homotetramers reported so far.

Some of the isolated peptides were chemically synthesized and investigated for the spectrum of biological activity. One of the isolated peptides, neokyotorphin (-Ser---Arg), earlier known as a weak analgetic, is found to have a cardiotropic and thermoregulatory activity. Neokyotorphin activates in vitro voltage-dependent calcium and blocks ATP-dependent potassium currents in the frog atrial fibres. Intraperitoneal injection of this peptide in hibernating ground squirrels speeds up the arousal of animals increasing sharply the heart rate and  consumption. Intraperitoneal and intranasal administrations of neokyotorphin in rats raises body temperature in thermoneutral conditions (26-28 degrees C) exerting no effects at low (4-6 degrees C) and high (31-32 degrees C) environmental temperatures. Another isolated peptide, Asp-, blocks the inward voltage-dependent calcium current in the frog atrial fibres and slightly increases the outward potassium current.

In order to test this hypothesis, alanine mutagenesis was used to probe the contribution of residues in the vicinity of the 6-phosphate to binding of 6PG and catalysis. The crystal structure of sheep liver 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase shows that -191, -260, -262, Arg-287, and Arg-446 contribute a mixture of ionic and hydrogen bonding interactions to the 6-phosphate, and these interactions are likely to provide the majority of the binding  for 6PG. All mutant enzymes, with the exception of T262A, exhibit an increase in K(6PG) that ranges from 5- to 800-fold. There is also a less pronounced increase in K(NADP), ranging from 3- to 15-fold, with the exception of T262A. The R287A and R446A mutant enzymes exhibit a dramatic decrease in V/E(t) (600- and 300-fold, respectively) as well as in V/K(6PG)E(t) (10(5) - and 10(4)-fold), and therefore no further characterization was carried out with these two mutant enzymes. No change in V/E(t) was observed for the Y191A mutant enzyme, whereas 20- and 3-fold decreases were obtained for the K260A and T262A mutant enzymes, respectively, resulting in a decrease in V/K(6PG)E(t) range from 3- to 120-fold. All mutant enzymes also exhibit at least an order of magnitude increase in 13C-isotope effect -1, indicating that the decarboxylation step has become more rate-limiting. Data are consistent with significant roles for -191, -260, -262, Arg-287, and Arg-446 in providing the binding  for 6PG. In addition, these residues also likely ensure proper orientation of 6PG for catalysis and aid in inducing the conformation change that precedes, and sets up the active site for, catalysis.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29490036>Cloning and characterization of the novel d-aspartyl endopeptidase, paenidase, from Paenibacillus sp.

Data from 25 papers, published from 1995 to 2018, for a total of 44 trials and 210 observations were recorded in a database. Diets were reformulated using the NRC (2012) loading values to estimate nutrient concentrations. The response variables were average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain-to-feed ratio (G:F). The predictor variables tested included average  (BW), crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, Ile:, Leu:, Val:, BCAA:, Ile:Leu, Val:Leu, Ile:Val, (Ile+Val):Leu, Trp:, Leu:Trp, Ile:Trp, Val:Trp, BCAA:Trp, Met:, Leu:Met, Ile:Met, Val:Met, BCAA:Met, His:, Leu:His, Ile:His, Val:His, BCAA:His, :, Leu:, Ile:, Val:, BCAA:, (Phe+):, Leu:(Phe+), Ile:(Phe+), Val:(Phe+), BCAA:(Phe+), LNAA:, Leu:LNAA, Ile:LNAA, Val:LNAA, and BCAA:LNAA. Amino acids were expressed on standardized ileal digestible basis. The MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used to develop the equations. The inverse of squared SEM was used to account for heterogeneous errors using the  statement. Models were selected with a step-wise manual forward selection. In order to be included in the final model, predictor variables had to be statistically significant (P < 0.05) and provide an improvement of at least 2 points in Bayesian information criterion. The optimum equations were: ADG, g = - 985.94 + (15.2499 × average BW (kg)) - (0.08885 × average BW × average BW) + (1.063 × Leu:) + (20.2659 × Ile:) - (0.1479 × Ile: × Ile:) + (9.2243 × (Ile+Val):Leu) - (0.03321 × (Ile+Val):Leu × (Ile+Val):Leu) - (0.4413 × Ile:Trp); G:F, g/kg = 648.3 - (6.2974 × average BW (kg)) + (0.02051 × average BW × average BW) + (0.5396 × Ile:) + (1.7284 × Val:) - (0.00795 × Val: × Val:) - (1.7594 × Met:); and ADFI, kg = predicted ADG/predicted G:F. Overall, the prediction equations suggest that increasing Leu: negatively impacts ADG due to a reduction in G:F and ADFI caused by insufficient levels of other BCAA and LNAA relative to Leu. According to the model, the addition of Val, Ile, and Trp, alone or in combination, has the potential to counteract the negative effects of high dietary Leu concentrations on growth performance.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, preventing CA infection in these patients is still a daunting challenge. Herein, inspired from the fact that immunization with secreted aspartyl proteinases 2 (Sap2) can prevent the infection, it is proposed to use filamentous phage, a human-safe virus nanofiber specifically infecting bacteria (≈900 nm long and 7 nm wide), to display an epitope peptide of Sap2 (EPS, with a sequence of Val----Ser) on its side wall and thus serve as a vaccine for preventing CA infection. The engineered virus nanofibers and recombinant Sap2 (rSap2) are then separately used to immunize mice. The humoral and cellular immune responses in the immunized mice are evaluated. Surprisingly, the virus nanofibers significantly induce mice to produce strong immune response as rSap2 and generate antibodies that can bind Sap2 and CA to inhibit the CA infection. Consequently, immunization with the virus nanofibers in mice dramatically increases the survival rate of CA-infected mice. All these results, along with the fact that the virus nanofibers can be mass-produced by infecting bacteria cost-effectively, suggest that virus nanofibers displaying EPS can be a vaccine candidate against fungal infection.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We show that IQ irreversibly inactivates Mycobacterium tuberculosis shikimate kinase (MtSK) through covalent modification of the protein. Inactivation occurred with an apparent second-order rate constant of about 60 M s. Following reaction with IQ, LC-MS analyses of intact MtSK revealed covalent modification of MtSK by IQ, with the concomitant loss of a methoxy group, suggesting a Michael-addition mechanism. Evaluation of tryptic fragments of IQ-derivatized MtSK by MS/MS demonstrated that Ser and  residues were most frequently modified with lesser involvement of  and . In or near the MtSK active site, three residues of the P-loop (K15, S16, and T17) as well as S77, T111, and S44 showed evidence of IQ-dependent derivatization. Accordingly, inclusion of ATP in IQ reactions with MtSK partially protected the enzyme from inactivation and limited IQ-based derivatization of K15 and S16. Additionally, molecular docking models for MtSK-IQ were generated for IQ-derivatized S77 and T111. In the latter, ATP was observed to sterically clash with the IQ moiety. Out of three other enzymes evaluated, lactate dehydrogenase was derivatized and inactivated by IQ, but pyruvate kinase and catalase-peroxidase (KatG) were unaffected. Together, these data suggest that IQ is promiscuous (though not entirely indiscriminant) in its reactivity. As such, the potential of IQ as a lead in the development of antitubercular agents directed against MtSK or other targets is questionable.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The control group received a corn-soybean meal-based diet, the treatment group fed diets containing 5%, 10%, and 15% FBR, respectively (abbreviated as FBR5, FBR10, and FBR15, respectively). Every group received equivalent-energy and nitrogen diets. The test lasted 60 days and was divided into early and late stages. Blood and carcass samples were obtained on 60 d. Meat quality was collected from two pigs per pen.During the late stage, the average daily feed intake and average daily gain of the treatment groups was greater than that of the control group (p<0.05). During the entire experiment, the average daily gain of the treatment groups was higher than that of the control group (p<0.05). Fermented biomass residue did not significantly affect serum biochemical parameters or meat quality, but did affect amino acid profiles in pork. The contents of Asp, Arg, , Phe, Leu, , Ser, , Pro, Ala, essential amino acids, non-essential amino acids, and total amino acids in pork of FBR5 and FBR10 were greater than those of the control group (p<0.05).These combined results suggest that feeding FBR could increase the average daily gain and average daily feed intake in pigs and the content of several flavor-promoting amino acids.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29668724>The somatostatin receptor 2 antagonist 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 outperforms 64Cu-DOTA-TATE in a mouse xenograft model.</a></h2><p>Copper-64 is an attractive radionuclide for PET imaging and is frequently used in clinical applications. The aim of this study was to perform a side-by-side comparison of the in vitro and in vivo performance of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (NODAGA = 1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric acid,4,7-acetic acid, JR11 = p-Cl-Phe-cyclo(D-Cys-Aph(Hor)-D-Aph(cbm)---Cys)D--NH2), a somatostatin receptor 2 antagonist, with the clinically used sst2 agonist 64Cu-DOTA-TATE ((TATE = D-Phe-cyclo(Cys--D-Trp---Cys)). In vitro studies demonstrated Kd values of 5.7±0.95 nM (Bmax = 4.1±0.18 nM) for the antagonist 64/natCu-NODAGA-JR11 and 20.1±4.4. nM (Bmax = 0.48±0.18 nM) for the agonist 64/natCu-DOTA-TATE. Cell uptake studies showed the expected differences between agonists and antagonists. Whereas 64Cu-DOTA-TATE (the agonist) showed very effective internalization in the cell culture assay (with 50% internalized at 4 hours post-peptide addition under the given experimental conditions), 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (the antagonist) showed little internalization but strong receptor-mediated uptake at the cell membrane. Biodistribution studies of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 showed rapid blood clearance and tumor uptake with increasing tumor-to-relevant organ ratios within the first 4 hours and in some cases, 24 hours, respectively. The tumor washout was slow or non-existent in the first 4 hours, whereas the kidney washout was very efficient, leading to high and increasing tumor-to-kidney ratios over time. Specificity of tumor uptake was proven by co-injection of high excess of non-radiolabeled peptide, which led to >80% tumor blocking. 64Cu-DOTA-TATE showed less favorable pharmacokinetics, with the exception of lower kidney uptake. Blood clearance was distinctly slower and persistent higher blood values were found at 24 hours. Uptake in the liver and lung was relatively high and also persistent. The tumor uptake was specific and similar to that of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 at 1 h, but release from the tumor was very fast, particularly between 4 and 24 hours. Tumor-to-normal organ ratios were distinctly lower after 1 hour. This is indicative of insufficient in vivo stability. PET studies of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 reflected the biodistribution data with nicely delineated tumor and low background. 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 shows promising pharmacokinetic properties for further translation into the clinic.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12071346>Lysozyme modification by the fenton reaction and gamma radiation.</a></h2><p>A comparative study was performed on lysozyme modification after exposure to Fenton reagent (Fe(II)/H2 O2) or hydroxyl radicals produced by y radiation. The conditions were adjusted to obtain, with both systems, a 50% loss of activity of the modified ensemble. Gamma radiation modified almost all types of amino acid residues in the enzyme, with little specificity. The modification order was  > Met = Cys >  > Ile + Leu > Gly > Pro = Phe >  + Ala > Trp = Ser > Arg > Asp + Glu, with 42 mol of modified residues per initial mole of native enzyme. In contrast, when the enzyme was exposed to the Fenton reaction, only some types of amino acids were modified. Furthermore, a smaller number of residues (13.5) were damaged per initial mole of enzyme. The order of the modified residues was  > Cys > Trp > Met His > Ile + Leu > Val > Arg. These results demonstrate that the modifications elicited by these two free radical sources follow different mechanisms.

A total of 384 male Cobb 500 BR and 288 LH were used in a completely randomized design (CRD) with 16 (BR) or 12 (LH) replicate cages with 6 birds/replicate. IEAAL and apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of AA were analyzed using the GLM procedure of SAS appropriate for a CRD while SIAAD values were analyzed using the GLM procedure of SAS appropriate for a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. For BR, IEAAL and N losses (mg/kg of dry matter intake, DMI) were higher (P < 0.05) when NFD with high Ca level was fed (total AA was 39%, N was 35% higher). For most of the AA, AID was higher (P < 0.05) in BR fed DDGS-based diet with high Ca level. High dietary Ca resulted in higher (P < 0.05) SIAAD for all the AA except for Arg, , Met, Cys, and . For LH, AID of AA was higher (P < 0.05) for the DDGS diet with high Ca level in 13 of the 18 AA evaluated. There was interaction (P < 0.05) between diet Ca level and correction method on LH SIAAD values for , Asp, Gly, and Ser. The SIAAD values for 8 AA were higher (P < 0.05) in birds on high Ca DDGS diet. Correction with low Ca NFD resulted in higher (P < 0.05) SIAAD values for all the AA. Result from this study showed that high Ca increased total IEAAL in BR by 39% but decreased same by 27% in LH. Finally, SIAAD values were increased in BR fed high Ca DDGS-based diet while SIAAD value in LH was lower when correction was done using values from high Ca-NFD fed birds.© 2017 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27156249>KE108-conjugated unimolecular micelles loaded with a novel HDAC inhibitor thailandepsin-A for targeted neuroendocrine cancer therapy.</a></h2><p>Neuroendocrine (NE) cancers can cause significant patient morbidity. Besides surgery, there are no curative treatments for NE cancers and their metastases, emphasizing the need for the development of other forms of therapy. In this study, multifunctional unimolecular micelles were developed for targeted NE cancer therapy. The unimolecular micelles were formed by multi-arm star amphiphilic block copolymer poly(amidoamine)-poly(valerolactone)-poly(ethylene glycol) conjugated with KE108 peptide and Cy5 dye (abbreviated as PAMAM-PVL-PEG-KE108/Cy5). The unimolecular micelles with a spherical core-shell structure exhibited a uniform size distribution and excellent stability. The hydrophobic drug thailandepsin-A (TDP-A), a recently discovered HDAC inhibitor, was physically encapsulated into the hydrophobic core of the micelles. KE108 peptide, a somatostatin analog possessing high affinity for all five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTR 1-5), commonly overexpressed in NE cancer cells, was used for the first time as an NE cancer targeting ligand. KE108 exhibited superior targeting abilities compared to other common somatostatin analogs, such as octreotide, in NE cancer cell lines. The in vitro assays demonstrated that the TDP-A-loaded, KE108-targeted micelles exhibited the best capabilities in suppressing NE cancer cell growth. Moreover, the in vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging on NE-tumor-bearing nude mice showed that KE108-conjugated micelles exhibited the greatest tumor accumulation due to their passive targeting and active targeting capabilities. Finally, TDP-A-loaded and KE108-conjugated micelles possessed the best anticancer efficacy without detectable systemic toxicity. Thus, these novel TDP-A-loaded and KE108-conjugated unimolecular micelles offer a promising approach for targeted NE cancer therapy.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Site-directed mutagenesis of the distal histidine.</a></h2><p>Sperm whale myoglobin mutants were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis to replace the highly conserved distal histidine residue (His(E7)-64). His-64 was substituted with Gly, Val, Phe, Cys, Met, , Arg, Asp, , and , and all 10 mutant proteins expressed to approximately 10% of the total soluble cell protein in Escherichia coli as heme containing myoglobin. With the exception of His-64----, which did not form a stable  (O2) complex, all mutant proteins could be reduced and bound O2 and carbon monoxide (CO) reversibly. However, removal of the distal histidine increased the rate of autooxidation 40-350-fold. The His-64----Gly, Val, Phe, Met, and Arg mutants all showed markedly increased O2 dissociation rate constants which were approximately 50-1500-fold higher than those for wild-type myoglobin and increased O2 association rate constants which were approximately 5-15-fold higher than those for the native protein. All mutants studied (except His-64----) showed approximately 10-fold increased CO association rates and relatively unchanged CO dissociation rates. These altered O2 and CO association and dissociation rate constants resulted in 3-14-fold increased CO affinities, 10-200-fold decreased O2 affinities, and 50-380-fold greater M (KCO/KO2) values for the mutants compared to the wild-type protein. Thus, the distal histidine of myoglobin discriminates between CO and O2 binding by both sterically hindering bound CO and stabilizing bound O2 through hydrogen bonding. The increased autooxidation rates observed for the mutants appear to be due to a decrease in  affinity and an increase in solvent anion accessibility to the distal pocket.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22457392>Leucine is essential for attenuating fetal growth restriction caused by a protein-restricted diet in rats.</a></h2><p>Certain amino acids, such as leucine (Leu) are not only substrates for protein synthesis but also are important regulators of protein . Moreover, it is known that alterations in intrauterine growth favor the development of chronic diseases in adulthood. Therefore, we investigated the role of Leu in combination with other BCAA on effects that are induced by maternal protein restriction on fetal growth. Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups according to the diet provided during pregnancy: control (C; 20% casein); V+I [5% casein + 2% L-valine (Val) + 2% L-isoleucine (Ile)]; KYT [5% casein + 1.8% L-lysine () + 1.2% L-tyrosine () + 1% L-threonine ()]; and BCAA (5% casein + 1.8% L-Leu + 1.2% L-Val + 1% L-Ile). Maternal protein restriction reduced the growth and organ weight of the offspring of dams receiving the V+I and KYT diets compared with the C group. Supplementation with BCAA reversed this growth deficit, minimizing the difference or restoring the mass of organs and carcass , the liver and muscle protein, and the RNA concentrations compared with newborns in the C group (P < 0.05). These effects could be explained by the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway, because phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in the liver of offspring of the BCAA group was greater than that in the C, V+I, and KYT groups. The present results identify a critical role for Leu in association with other BCAA in the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway for the control of altered intrauterine growth induced by a maternal low-protein diet.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27438891>Role of Conserved Gly-Gly Pairs on the Periplasmic Side of LacY.</a></h2><p>On the periplasmic side of LacY, two conserved Gly-Gly pairs in helices II and XI (Gly46 and Gly370, respectively) and helices V and VIII (Gly159 and Gly262, respectively) allow close packing of each helix pair in the outward (periplasmic)-closed conformation. Previous studies demonstrate that replacing one Gly residue in each Gly-Gly pair with Trp leads to opening of the periplasmic cavity with abrogation of transport activity, but an increased rate of galactoside binding. To further investigate the role of the Gly-Gly pairs, 11 double-replacement mutants were constructed for each pair at positions 46 (helix II) and 262 (helix VIII). Replacement with Ala or Ser results in decreased but significant transport activity, while replacements with , Val, Leu, Asn, Gln, , Trp, Glu, or  exhibit very little or no transport. Remarkably, however, the double mutants bind galactoside with affinities 10-20-fold higher than that of the pseudo-WT or WT LacY. Moreover, site-directed alkylation of a periplasmic Cys replacement indicates that the periplasmic cavity becomes readily accessible in the double-replacement mutants.

Recently, the somatostatin analogue [Tyr3]octreotide (D-Phe-c(Cys--D-Trp---Cys)-(ol)) was derivatized with the chelator DOTA (tetra-azacyclododecane-tetra-acetic acid), enabling stable radiolabelling with both the high- beta particle-emitter yttrium-90 and the Auger electron-emitter indium-111. The thus produced radiolabelled compounds are promising for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. Our previous in vitro and in vivo (rat) experiments with these radiolabelled compounds showed favourable binding and biodistribution characteristics with high uptake and retention in the target organs. We also demonstrated receptor-specific, time- and temperature-dependent internalization of radiolabelled [DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotide in somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2)-positive rat pancreatic tumour cell lines. In this study we have investigated the effects of differences in the amount of injected peptide on tissue distribution of 111In-labelled [DOTA0, Tyr3]octreotide in normal, i.e. non-tumour-bearing, and CA20948 tumour-bearing rats. This was done in order to find the amount of peptide at which the highest uptake in target tissues is achieved, and thereby to increase the potential of radionuclide therapy while simultaneously ensuring the lowest possible radiotoxicity in normal organs. Uptake of radiolabelled [DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotide in sst2-positive organs showed different bell-shaped functions of the amount of injected peptide, being highest at 0.05 (adrenals), 0.05-0. 1 (pituitary and stomach) and 0.25 (pancreas) microg. Uptake in the tumour was highest at 0.5 microg injected peptide. The highest uptake was found at peptide amounts that were lower than those reported for [111In-DTPA0]octreotide ((D-Phe-c(Cys-Phe-D-Trp---Cys)-(ol), DTPA = diethylene-triamine-penta-acetic acid), consistent with the higher receptor affinity of the first compound. Our observations of mass-dependent differences in uptake of radiolabelled [DOTA0, Tyr3]octreotide, being the resultant of a positive effect of increasing amounts of peptide on, for example, receptor clustering and a negative effect of receptor saturation, are of consequence for rat radionuclide therapy studies with radiolabelled peptides and may also be of consequence for human radionuclide therapy studies with this compound.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6487083>[Effect of the content of crude plant protein in feed on the utilization of urea in dairy cattle. 4.

Diets included a N-free diet based on cornstarch and sucrose and 10 test diets formulated with 96.6% 1 of the 10 corns as the sole source of AA. Chromic oxide (0.3%) was added to each diet as an indigestible marker for calculating the AA digestibility. On a DM basis, the starch, ether extract (EE), CP, NDF, and ADF contents of corns averaged 74.05% (69.98 to 78.59%), 3.83% (2.04 to 4.73%), 9.63% (7.74 to 10.43%), 10.80% (10.27 to 11.46%), and 2.27% (2.03 to 2.57%), respectively. The CV of EE, CP, and ADF was 22.59, 8.22, and 8.21%, respectively. The DE and ME of corns averaged 4,087 and 3,981 kcal/kg, respectively, and ranged from 3,999 to 4,161 kcal/kg and from 3,898 to 4,067 kcal/kg, respectively. The DE and ME values were positively correlated (P < 0.05) with the EE content. Optimal prediction equations of ME were ME = 940.35 + (0.72 × DE) + (21.88 × EE) (R2 = 0.94) or ME = 1,051.50 + (0.82 × DE) - (282.05 × ash) (R2 = 0.99).

The SID of  (average 73.79%), Met (average 87.32%), and  (average 80.06%) ranged from 61.45 to 78.47%, from 74.09 to 90.91%, and from 79.19 to 85.79%, respectively. The standardized ileal digestible Met was positively correlated (P < 0.01) with the Met and CP contents.

Current data suggest that cytoplasmic membrane proteins ExbB and ExbD harness pmf . Transmembrane domain (TMD) interactions between TonB and ExbD allow the ExbD C terminus to modulate conformational rearrangements of the periplasmic TonB C terminus in vivo. These conformational changes somehow allow energization of high-affinity TonB-gated transporters by direct interaction with TonB. While ExbB is essential for  transduction, its role is not well understood. ExbB has N-terminus-out, C-terminus-in topology with three TMDs. TMDs 1 and 2 are punctuated by a cytoplasmic loop, with the C-terminal tail also occupying the cytoplasm. We tested the hypothesis that ExbB TMD residues play roles in proton translocation. Reassessment of TMD boundaries based on hydrophobic character and residue conservation among distantly related ExbB proteins brought earlier widely divergent predictions into congruence. All TMD residues with potentially function-specific side chains (, Cys, Ser, , , Glu, and Asn) and residues with probable structure-specific side chains (Trp, Gly, and Pro) were substituted with Ala and evaluated in multiple assays. While all three TMDs were essential, they had different roles: TMD1 was a region through which ExbB interacted with the TonB TMD. TMD2 and TMD3, the most conserved among the ExbB/TolQ/MotA/PomA family, played roles in signal transduction between cytoplasm and periplasm and the transition from ExbB homodimers to homotetramers.

The concentrations of His, Gly, Ala, Val, Met, Phe,  and Glu increased, while those of , Ser and Asp decreased in the first stage of myocardial infarction.

Leaf portions of the seed-derived plants were placed on an MS-medium fortified with different PGRs. Under 16hD/8hL, thidiazuron (TDZ; 4.0 mg L⁻¹) and BA (1.5 mg L⁻¹) was found to be the most effective (<90%) in callus induction. Two concentrations (1.5, 2.0 mg L⁻¹) of the IBA produced>80% shoots from callus cultures. Healthy shoots were transferred to rooting medium and higher percentage of rooting (<90%) was observed on IBA (1.5 mg L⁻¹). These in vitro tissues were subjected to amino acid analysis, spectrophotometry, and HPLC. ARG, SER, , and  were the most abundant components out of 17 amino acids. Higher amino acid production was observed under normal photoperiod (16hL/8hD) than under reverse photoperiod (16hD/8hL). The highest total phenolic content (TPC; 9.91 mg/g-DW) and flavonoid content (7.38 mg/g-DW) were observed in callus cultures incubated under 16hL/8hD than other tissues incubated under 16hD/8hL photoperiod. Higher DPPH and PoMo activities were observed in tissues incubated under 16hL/8hD photoperiod, while ABTS and Fe²⁺ chelating activities were found higher in tissues incubated under reverse photoperiod. Significant quantities of piperine content were observed in all tissues except callus cultures. These results suggest that reverse photoperiod is a promising approach for callus induction, phytochemicals and piperine production for commercial applications.Copyright © 2013 Académie des sciences.

The control diet contained fish meal as the main protein source, while in the other diets 50% of the fish meal protein was replaced by not de-hulled solvent-extracted soybean meal, meat meal or bacterial protein meal. Ileal digestibility was obtained with animals modified with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA method). There were no significant differences in the average digestibility of CP, , Trp, Val, Ala or Glu between IRA modified and intact animals. Average ileal digestibilities of His, , Asp, Cys, Gly, Hyp, Pro, Ser, starch and total carbohydrates (CHO) were significantly lower compared with total tract values. Average ileal digestibility of Arg, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe,  and crude  was significantly higher than total tract digestibility. Digestibility measured in IRA modified animals showed less variability compared with values from intact animals. There were significant differences among diets in ileal as well as total tract digestibility of orude protein, most amino acids, starch and CHO, and in ileal digestibility of crude . Ileal crude protein digestibility of the diets ranged from 81.0-86.4% and total tract digestibility from 82.5-86.4%. Ileal amino acid digestibilities ranged from 70.1 (Asp) to 93.3% (Arg) and total tract values ranged from 72.8 (Cys) to 92.2% (Arg). Both ileal and total tract digestibilities of crude protein and most amino acids were significantly lower for diets containing meat meal or bacterial protein meal compared with the control fish meal-based diet and the diet with soybean meal. Although ileal digestibility may be more accurate than total tract digestibility in estimating the protein and amino acid supply in blue foxes, total tract digestibility may be acceptable because of numerically small differences between ileal and total tract digestibilities for protein and most amino acids. It was further concluded that ileal digestibilities of starch and CHO in the blue fox are lower than corresponding total tract digestibilities.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28849491>Synthesis of N-Chloroamino Acids and Their Biological Activities in LPS Stimulated RAW 264.7 Cells.</a></h2><p>Amino acids (AAs) are essential for protein synthesis, neurotransmission and macro molecule biosynthesis. Ala, Gln, Gly, , Val and taurine (Tau) are the most abundant free AAs in mammals, and some of these react with hypochlorite (HOCl/OCl) produced by myeloperoxidase in activated phagocytes to form N-chloroamino acids (NCAA). In this study, we reacted 20 AAs and Tau with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), then classified the products into five types (I-V) based on the change in their absorbance. Type I AAs (Ala, Arg, Gln, Gly, Ile, , Phe, Ser, Tau,  and Val) generated a typical monochloramine peak at 252 nm, while Type II AAs (Asn and ) and Type III AAs (Glu and Leu) produced peaks at 275 nm and 225 nm, respectively. The Type IV AAs (His, Met and Trp) did not show any distinct absorption peak, and Type V AAs (Asp, Cys and Pro) did not appear to react with NaOCl. The ArgCl and TauCl were stable, while GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, PheCl and ValCl were less stable and AlaCl, SerCl and ThrCl were the least stable. Tau is the most abundant non-proteinogenic free AA in cellular fluid and has many physiological functions in the nervous, cardiovascular, renal and immune systems. Tau reacts with HOCl to form TauCl, which inhibits the production of proinflammatory mediators such as superoxide, nitric oxide (NO) and interleukins, while increasing the antioxidant proteins in macrophages. We determined the effects of Type I NCAA on cell viability, NO and TNF-α production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells. All Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited LPS-induced NO production. However, only GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, SerCl and TauCl inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α production. In summary, Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited NO production, while their effects on TNF-α varied. Our results suggest that Type I NCAA may serve as biological regulators similar to TauCl during inflammation.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25666040>Peptides as modulators of α-synuclein aggregation.</a></h2><p>α-Synuclein forms amyloid deposits in the dopaminergic neurons; a process that is believed to contribute to the Parkinson's disease. An emerging theme in amyloid research is the hypothesis that the toxic species produced during amyloid formation share common physic-chemical features and exert their effects by common modes. This prompted the idea that molecules able to inhibit a protein aggregation process may cross-react with other amyloidogenic proteins, interfering in their fibrils formation. We investigate the ability of analogues of the heptapeptide H-Arg--Val-MePhe---Trp- OH2, an inhibitor of Aβ-peptide aggregation, to cross-react with α-synuclein interfering with its fibril formation. The influence of the MePhe topography on the interaction with α-synuclein has also been evaluated, replacing the MePhe residue with either Phe or the conformationally restricted Tic residues. Peptides interact with good affinity with the α-synuclein monomer, promoting its aggregation process. This work provides the basis for the development of new drugs based on peptidomimetics able to modify the oligomers - mature fibrils equilibrium towards this last species.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22273147>New lyophilized kit for rapid radiofluorination of peptides.</a></h2><p>Radiolabeling compounds with positron-emitting radionuclides often involves a time-consuming, customized process. Herein, we report a simple lyophilized kit formulation for labeling peptides with (18)F, based on the aluminum-fluoride procedure. The prototype kit contains IMP485, a NODA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetate)-MPAA (methyl phenylacetic acid)-di-HSG (histamine-succinyl-glycine) hapten-peptide, [NODA-MPAA-D-(HSG)-D--D-(HSG)-NH(2)], used for pretargeting, but we also examined a similar kit formulation for a somatostatin-binding peptide [IMP466, NOTA-D-Phe-Cys-Phe-D-Trp---Cys-Throl] bearing a NOTA ligand to determine if the benefits of using a kit can be extended to other AlF-binding peptides. The NODA-MPAA ligand forms a single stable complex with (AlF)(2+) in high yields. In order to establish suitable conditions for a facile kit, the formulation was optimized for pH, peptide to Al(3+) ratio, bulking agent, radioprotectant, and the buffer. For optimal labeling, the kit was reconstituted with an aqueous solution of (18)F(-) and ethanol (1:1), heated at 100-110 °C for 15 min, and then simply and rapidly purified using one of two equally effective solid-phase extraction (SPE) methods. Al(18)F-IMP485 was isolated as a single isomer complex, in high yield (45-97%) and high specific activity (up to 223 GBq/μmol), within 20 min. The labeled product was stable in human serum at 37 °C for 4 h and in vivo, urine samples showed the intact product was eliminated. Tumor targeting of the Al(18)F-IMP485 in nude mice bearing human  xenografts pretargeted with an anti-CEACAM5 bispecific antibody showed very low uptake (0.06% ± 0.02 ID/g) in bone, further illustrating its stability. At 1 h, pretargeted animals had high Al(18)F-IMP485 tumor uptake (28.1% ± 4.5 ID/g), with ratios of 9 ± 4, 123 ± 38, 110 ± 43, and 120 ± 108 for kidney, liver, blood and bone, respectively. Tumor uptake remained high at 3 h postinjection, with increased tumor/nontumor ratios. The NOTA-somatostatin-binding peptide also was fluorinated with good yield and high specific activity in the same kit formulation. However, yields were somewhat lower than those achieved with IMP485 containing the NODA-MPAA ligand, likely reflecting this ligand's superior binding properties over the simple NOTA. These studies indicate that (18)F-labeled peptides can be reproducibly prepared as stable Al-F complexes with good radiochemical yield and high specific activity using a simple, one-step, lyophilized kit followed by a rapid purification by SPE that provides the (18)F-peptide ready for patient injection within 30 min.</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1384748>Dipeptide backbone conformation and antibody recognition of a viral octapeptide epitope.</a></h2><p>The peptide YKGTMDSG (--Gly--Met-Asp-Ser-Gly) represents an important antigenic determinant from the glycoprotein G2 of the pathogenic Rift Valley fever virus. By preparing a series of single-residue substitution peptides, the importance to antigenicity of individual residues within this octapeptide has been determined. Here, we investigated a simple and rapid computational analysis to test for correlations between the observed antigenicity of the substitution analogue peptides and the calculated conformational preferences in local regions of the peptides. Conformational  analyses were carried out on all dipeptide combinations represented in the wild-type octapeptide and in the single-residue substitution analogue peptides. Conformational similarities and differences between wild-type and substitution dipeptide pairs were determined. The results of these computational analyses were then compared with the data on the relative antigenicity of the wild-type octapeptide and the substitution analogues. This comparison revealed a positive correlation. Substitution peptides showing changes in antigenicity possessed significant changes in the calculated backbone conformation relative to wild type in the dipeptides encompassing the residue substitution. Substitution peptides showing no change in antigenicity similarly showed no significant changes in dipeptide conformation.

TT-232 combined with decarbazine or etoposide treatment enhanced the antitumor activity of these drugs on human melanoma and lymphoma xenografts, respectively. Regarding the mode of action, TT-232 activates cell cycle inhibitors via SSTR receptors, inhibits tyrosine kinases through interfering with the proliferative signaling cascades, and interacts with an intracellular receptor and an enzyme involved in glycolysis causing translocation of this enzyme to the nucleus, thus inducing apoptosis.

The serum concentration (SC) of free AA in pigs can be used as indicators of their availability. This study was conducted with 12 crossbred (Landrace × Hampshire × Duroc) pigs (29.0 ± 2.8 kg initial BW) distributed into 2 groups to analyze the SC of free AA and some AA metabolites in pigs exposed to HS conditions. The treatments were pigs housed under natural HS conditions in a room with no ambient temperature control (23.6 to 37.6°C, HS) and pigs housed at thermoneutral conditions (24 ± 2°C), feed restricted to a level similar to that of their HS counterparts. All pigs received a wheat-soybean meal diet. Blood samples were collected at both the absorptive (2.5 h after a meal) and postabsorptive (10.0 h after a meal) phase. At the absorptive phase, the SC of free Arg, Leu, , Phe, , and Trp were lower ( < 0.05) and the SC of His, Val, Ala, Pro, Ser, and  tended to be lower ( < 0.10) in HS pigs. At the postabsorptive phase, the SC of free Arg, His, Met, Asn, Gln, and  were higher ( < 0.05) but the SC of Ala was lower ( < 0.01) and the SC of Pro tended to be lower ( < 0.10) in HS pigs. The absorptive SC of carnosine, ornithine (Orn), and Tau were lower ( < 0.05) and of citrulline (Cit), cystathionine, and urea tended to be lower ( < 0.10) in HS pigs.

The exposure of SR vesicles (10 mg/ml protein) to low peroxynitrite concentrations ( < or = 0.2 mM) resulted in a decrease of Ca(2+)-ATPase activity primarily through oxidation of sulfhydryl groups. Most of this deactivation (ca.70%) could be chemically reversed by subsequent reduction of the enzyme with either dithiothreitol (DTT) or sodium borohydride (NaBH4), indicating that free cysteine groups were oxidized to disulfides. The initial presence of 5 mM glutathione failed to protect the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase activity. However, as long as peroxynitrite concentrations were kept < or = 0.45 mM, the efficacy of DTT to reverse Ca(2+)-ATPase inactivation was enhanced for reaction mixtures which initially contained 5 mM glutathione. At least part of the disulfides were formed intermolecularly since gel electrophoresis revealed protein aggregation which could be reduced under reducing conditions. The application of higher peroxynitrite concentrations ( > or = 0.45 mM) resulted in Ca(2+)-ATPase inactivation which could not be restored by exposure of the modified protein to reducing agents. On the other hand, treatment of modified protein with NaBH4 recovered all SR protein thiols. This result indicates that possibly the oxidation of other amino acids contributes to enzyme inactivation, corroborated by amino acid analysis which revealed some additional targets for peroxynitrite or peroxynitrite-induced processes such as Met, , Phe, , Ser, Leu and .  oxidation was confirmed by a significant lower sensitivity of oxidized SR proteins to the Lowry assay. However, neither bityrosine nor nitrotyrosine were formed in significant yields, as monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy and immunodetection, respectively. The Ca(2+)-ATPase of SR is involved in cellular Ca(2+)-homeostasis.

The average initial BW in periods 1 and 2 were 22 and 30 kg, respectively. Each period lasted 9 d with fecal collection on d 5 and 6 and a 12-h ileal digesta collection on d 7, 8, and 9. Pigs received a daily feed allowance of approximately 4.5% of their BW. The experimental diets were based on corn, soybean meal, wheat middlings, and corn distillers dried grain with solubles.

Through comprehensive analysis of multiple human protective antibodies, we previously identified four vulnerable sites (VS1-VS4) on the globular head domain. Among them, the VS1, occupying the opposite side of the RBS on the same HA, was defined by the epitope of antibody 65C6. In this study, we report the crystal structures of two additional human H5N1 antibodies isolated from H5N1-infected individuals, 3C11 and AVFluIgG01, bound to the head at 2.33- and 2.30-Å resolution, respectively. These two new antibody epitopes have large overlap with and extend beyond the original VS1. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments identified eight pivotal residues (Ser-126b, -165, Arg-166, Ser-167, -168, Asn-169, -171, and Asn-172) critical for 65C6-, 3C11-, and AVFluIgG01-binding and neutralization activities. These residues formed a unique "Y"-shaped surface on H5N1 globular head and are highly conserved among H5N1 viruses.

Elevated expression of OsAAP3 in transgenic plants resulted in significantly higher amino acid concentrations of , Arg, His, Asp, Ala, Gln, Gly,  and , and inhibited bud outgrowth and rice tillering.

The promoter sequences of OsAAP3 showed some divergence between Japonica and Indica rice, and expression of the gene was higher in Japonica, which produced fewer tillers than Indica. We generated knockout lines of OsAAP3 on Japonica ZH11 and KY131 using CRISPR technology and found that grain yield could be increased significantly.

Metal-ligand complexes or active site prosthetic groups which absorb in the visible region exhibit prominent CT transitions. Furthermore, the protein backbone also exhibits CT transitions in the far UV range. In this manuscript, we present a detailed computational study of new near UV-visible CT transitions that involve amino acids with charged side chains. Specifically, using time dependent density functional theory calculations, we examine the absorption spectra of naturally charged amino acids (, Glu, Arg, Asp and His), extracted from solution phase protein structures generated by classical molecular dynamics simulations, and phosphorylated amino acids (,  and Ser) from experimentally determined protein structures. We show that amino acids with charged sidechains present a directed electronic donor-bridge-acceptor paradigm, with the lowest  optical excitations demonstrating peptide backbone-sidechain charge separations. The UV-visible spectral range of the backbone-sidechain CT transitions is determined by the chemical nature of the donor, bridge and acceptor groups within each amino acid, amino acid conformation and the protein secondary structure where the amino acids are located. Photoinduced CT occurs in opposite directions for the anionic and cationic amino acids along the ground state dipole moment vector for the chromophores. We find that photoinduced charge separation is more facile for the anionic amino acids (Asp, Glu, pSer, pThr and pTyr) relative to that for the cationic amino acids (, Arg and Hsp).

The results correlate very well with N2 propensities in proteins, moderately well with N1 and helix interior preferences, and not at all with N-cap preferences. The strongest energetic effects result from interactions with the helix dipole, which favors negative charges at the helix N terminus. Hydrogen bonds to side chains at N2, such as Gln, Ser, and , are weak, despite occurring frequently in protein crystal structures, in contrast to the N-cap position. This is because N-cap hydrogen bonds are close to linear, whereas N2 hydrogen bonds have poor geometry.

DOI was found to stimulate estradiol biosynthesis in rat ovarian granulosa cells; induce estradiol and progesterone secretion in 16- to 18-month-old female Sprague Dawley rats by upregulating expressions of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor and ovarian aromatase; counteract the progression of osteoporosis and augment bone mineral density; and improve cognitive functioning by upregulating protein expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and TrkB receptors in the prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, DOI did not stimulate the proliferation of breast cancer and ovarian cancer cells, which suggest it could be a more efficacious and safer alternative to HRT.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26545767>213 nm Ultraviolet Photodissociation on Peptide Anions: Radical-Directed Fragmentation Patterns.</a></h2><p>Characterization of acidic peptides and proteins is greatly hindered due to lack of suitable analytical techniques. Here we present the implementation of 213 nm ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) in high-resolution quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer in negative polarity for peptide anions. Radical-driven backbone fragmentation provides 22 distinctive fragment ion types, achieving the complete sequence coverage for all reported peptides. Hydrogen-deficient radical anion not only promotes the cleavage of Cα-C bond but also stimulates the breaking of N-Cα and C-N bonds. Radical-directed loss of small molecules and specific side chain of amino acids are detected in these experiments. Radical containing side chain of amino acids (, Ser, , and Asp) may possibly support the N-Cα backbone fragmentation. Proline comprising peptides exhibit the unusual fragment ions similar to reported earlier. Interestingly, basic amino acids such as Arg and  also stimulated the formation of abundant b and y ions of the related peptide anions. Loss of hydrogen atom from the charge-reduced radical anion and fragment ions are rationalized by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculation, locating the potential  surface (PES) of ππ* and repulsive πσ* excited states of a model amide system.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7430115>Amino acid sequence of the signal peptide of apoVLDL-II, a major apoprotein in avian very low density lipoproteins.</a></h2><p>ApoVLDL-II is a major apoprotein in avian very low density lipoproteins (Jackson, R. L., Lin, H.-Y., Chan, L., and Means, A.R. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 250-253). Partially purified apoVLDL-II mRNA was translated in vitro in a wheat germ system in the presence of various labeled amino acids. The product, designated preapoVLDL-II, was purified by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was subjected to automated Edman degradation in a Beckman Sequencer. The signal peptide was found to be a 23-amino acid NH2-terminal extension of the mature protein with the following sequence: Met-Gln--Arg-Ala-Leu-Val-Ile-Ala-Val-Ile-Leu-Leu-Leu-Ser--Val-Pro-Glu-Val-Cys-Ser- where  is the NH2-terminal residue of mature apoVLDL-II. The abundance and distribution of the hydrophobic amino acid residues are very similar to those of other signal sequences and the average hydrophobicity for the 23 residues is -1227 cal/mol/residue. However, translocation of preapoVLDL-II would represent a unique case of vectorial migration of a protein through a membrane since apoVLDL-II is itself an apolipoprotein and binds  spontaneously.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2599773>Correlation of beta-bend conformations of tetrapeptides with their activities in CD4-receptor binding assays.</a></h2><p>Conformational analysis, based on ECEPP (Empirical Conformational  Program for Peptides) using the chain build-up procedure, was applied to determine the low- conformations for a series of tetrapeptides. The tetrapeptides are components of larger peptides which have been found to bind to the CD4 receptor of monocytes. Several previous studies have implicated the tetrapeptide units investigated here as being critical to the biological activities of the full peptides. Five such tetrapeptides were studied: Ser-Ser-Asn- (from ribonuclease A), --Asn- (from peptide T, known to block human immunodeficiency virus from attaching to CD4+ T cells), -Ile-Asn- (from polio virus coat protein, which is less active than the other peptides in binding to CD4 receptors), Ser-Ser-Ala- (from the gp 120 coat protein of human immunodeficiency virus, a variant of the peptide T sequence, active in blocking viral attachment to CD4+ cells), and the tetrapeptide from an active synthetic pentapeptide, Asn--- (from Asn----). Using a 7 kcal/mol cutoff, the low- conformations for each peptide were computed. Approximately 20,000 conformations were computed for each tetrapeptide. Residue probability profiles were determined for each tetrapeptide. All tetrapeptides except for the polio sequence showed flexibility in the sense that many low- conformations were possible. In previous studies, it was postulated that the critical tetrapeptide units would adopt conformations similar to the one observed in a segment of ribonuclease A, residues 22-25, a beta-bend, which is part of an octapeptide segment (residues 19-26) that is homologous to the sequence of peptide T.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28798365>Mass & secondary structure propensity of amino acids explain their mutability and evolutionary replacements.</a></h2><p>Why is an amino acid replacement in a protein accepted during evolution? The answer given by bioinformatics relies on the frequency of change of each amino acid by another one and the propensity of each to remain unchanged. We propose that these replacement rules are recoverable from the secondary structural trends of amino acids. A distance measure between high-resolution Ramachandran distributions reveals that structurally similar residues coincide with those found in substitution matrices such as BLOSUM: Asn ↔ Asp, P™he ↔ ,  ↔ Arg, Gln ↔ Glu, Ile ↔ Val, Met → Leu; with Ala, Cys, His, Gly, Ser, Pro, and , as structurally idiosyncratic residues. We also found a high average correlation ([Formula: see text] = 0.85) between thirty amino acid mutability scales and the mutational inertia (I  ), which measures the energetic cost weighted by the number of observations at the most probable amino acid conformation. These results indicate that amino acid substitutions follow two optimally-efficient principles: (a) amino acids interchangeability privileges their secondary structural similarity, and (b) the amino acid mutability depends directly on its biosynthetic  cost, and inversely with its frequency. These two principles are the underlying rules governing the observed amino acid substitutions.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25726107>Short communication: Evaluation of amino acid consumption and necessary profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus T1C2 in controlled pH batch fermentations.</a></h2><p>The objective of the present study was to elucidate the relationship between amino acid consumption and necessary profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus T1C2 to guide the design of media for high-cell-density culture. The amino acid consumption and necessary patterns of S. thermophilus T1C2 were investigated in the complete chemically defined medium. For amino acid consumption profiles throughout the growth of S. thermophilus T1C2, the most abundantly consumed amino acids were Gln and Arg, which accounted for 19 and 20% of total amino acids consumed, respectively. Asparagine, , Ser, Ala, Val, Met, Leu, and , consumptions of which ranged from 3 to 10% of total amino acids consumed, were the second most intensively consumed amino acids. For necessary amino acid patterns, the amount of Cys, which counted for 11% of total amino acids needed, was significantly higher than the amounts required for other amino acids in growth of S. thermophilus T1C2. The necessary amounts of Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln, Arg, Ala, Met, and  ranked second, ranging from 5 to 8% of total amino acids needed. Compared with necessary amounts, the consumption of Asn, , Ser, Gln, Arg, Ala, Val, Leu, , His, and Phe exceeded the necessary amounts for growth of S. thermophilus T1C2 remarkably. Consumption of Gly, Met, Ile, Trp, and Pro was slightly higher than the necessary amounts. Consumption of Asp, Glu, , and Cys was lower than the necessary amounts. The overall consumption of amino acids exceeded the required amount for growth of S. thermophilus T1C2 almost 2.43 times, which implied a significant nitrogen wasting.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

The monosaccharide is non-enzymatically converted to 4-deoxy-L-ery thro-5-hexoseulose uronic acid (DEH), then reduced to 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate (KDG) by a specific reductase, and metabolized through the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Recently, the NADPH-dependent reductase A1-R that belongs to short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) superfamily was identified as the DEH-reductase in Sphingomonas sp. A1. We have subsequently noticed that an SDR-like enzyme gene, flred, occurred in the genome of an alginolytic bacterium Flavobacterium sp. strain UMI-01. In the present study, we report on the deduced amino-acid sequence of flred and DEH-reducing activity of recombinant FlRed. The deduced amino-acid sequence of flred comprised 254 residues and showed 34% amino-acid identities to that of A1-R from Sphingomonas sp. A1 and 80%-88% to those of SDR-like enzymes from several alginolytic bacteria. Common sequence motifs of SDR-superfamily enzymes, e.g., the catalytic tetrad Asn---Ser and the cofactor-binding sequence -Gly-x-x-x-Gly-x-Gly in Rossmann fold, were completely conserved in FlRed. On the other hand, an Arg residue that determined the NADPH-specificity of Sphingomonas A1-R was replaced by Glu in FlRed. Thus, we investigated cofactor-preference of FlRed using a recombinant enzyme. As a result, the recombinant FlRed (recFlRed) was found to show high specificity to NADH. recFlRed exhibited practically no activity toward variety of aldehyde, ketone, keto ester, keto acid and aldose substrates except for DEH. On the basis of these results, we conclude that FlRed is the NADH-dependent DEH-specific SDR of Flavobacterium sp. strain UMI-01.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26363471>Binding of Cu(II) ions to peptides studied by fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry.</a></h2><p>Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence quenching measurements supported by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) were used to study the interactions of Cu(2+) with four peptides. Two of them were taken from the N-terminal part of the FBP28 protein (formin binding protein) WW domain: ---Ala-Asp-Gly----NH2 (D9) and its mutant ---Ala-Asn-Gly----NH2 (D9_M) as well as two mutated peptides from the B3 domain of the immunoglobulin binding protein G derived from Streptococcus: Asp-Val-Ala----NH2 (J1) and Glu-Val-Ala----NH2 (J2). The measurements were carried out at 298.15K in 20mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer solution with a pH of 6. The fluorescence of all peptides was quenched by Cu(2+) ions. The stoichiometry, conditional stability constants and thermodynamic parameters for the interactions of the Cu(2+) ions with D9 and D9_M were determined from the calorimetric data. The values of the conditional stability constants were additionally determined from fluorescence quenching measurements and compared with those obtained from calorimetric studies. There was a good correlation between data obtained from the two techniques. On the other hand, the studies revealed that J1 and J2 do not exhibit an affinity towards metal ions. The obtained results prove that fluorescence quenching experiments may be successfully used in order to determine stability constants of complexes with fluorescent ligands. Finally, based on the obtained results, the coordinating properties of the peptides towards the Cu(2+) ions are discussed.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The very N-terminal amino acid sequence largely determines whether or not a given protein is Nt-acetylated. Currently, there are six distinct NATs characterized, NatA-NatF, in humans of which the in vivo substrate specificity of Naa50 (Nat5)/NatE, an alternative catalytic subunit of the human NatA, so far remained elusive. In this study, we quantitatively compared the Nt-acetylomes of wild-type yeast S. cerevisiae expressing the endogenous yeast Naa50 (yNaa50), the congenic strain lacking yNaa50, and an otherwise identical strain expressing human Naa50 (hNaa50). Six canonical yeast NatA substrates were Nt-acetylated less in yeast lacking yNaa50 than in wild-type yeast. In contrast, the ectopically expressed hNaa50 resulted, predominantly, in the Nt-acetylation of N-terminal Met (iMet) starting N-termini, including iMet-, iMet-Val, iMet-Ala, iMet-, iMet-Phe, iMet-Leu, iMet-Ser, and iMet- N-termini. This identified hNaa50 as being similar, in its substrate specificity, to the previously characterized hNaa60/NatF. In addition, the identification, in yNaa50-lacking yeast expressing hNaa50, of Nt-acetylated iMet followed by a small residue such as Ser, , Ala, or Val, revealed a kinetic competition between Naa50 and Met-aminopeptidases (MetAPs), and implied that Nt-acetylated iMet followed by a small residue cannot be removed by MetAPs, a deduction supported by our in vitro data. As such, Naa50-mediated Nt-acetylation may act to retain the iMet of proteins of otherwise MetAP susceptible N-termini and the fraction of retained and Nt-acetylated iMet (followed by a small residue) in such a setting would be expected to depend on the relative levels of ribosome-associated Naa50/NatA and MetAPs.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The quantum chemical calculations have been performed to analyze the interactions of 130 loop, 190 helix, 220 loop region, and conserved residues 95,145,153-155, of pandemic viruses' HA with sialo-trisaccharide receptor of avian and human using density functional theory. The HA's residues  95, Ala 138, Gln 191, Arg 220, and Asp 225 from the above regions have stronger interaction with avian receptor. The residues  136, Trp 153, His 183, and Asp 190 of HA are important and play a significant role to bind with human receptor. The residues  95, Ala 138,  145, Trp 153, Gln 192, and Gln 226 of HA of CA09 virus have found more interaction energies with human than avian receptors. Due to mutations in the active residues of HA of CA09 virus comparing with SC1918, the binding capabilities of HA with human have been increased. The molecular dynamics simulation was made to understand the different dynamical properties of HA and molecular interactions between HA of these two viruses with sialo-trisaccharide receptors of avian and human receptors. The interaction energy of HA of CA09 virus with human receptor decreases due to the human receptor far away from conserved residue region of HA protein. This reveals that the conserved residues particularly  145 play major contribution to interaction with human receptor in HA of CA09 virus.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1455953>[The hypometabolic effect of the blood plasma from a hibernating suslik Citellus undulatus.
