Downregulation of DNA Polymerase-α - Helicase Complex (Replisomes) and Glyco-Genes.</a></h1><p>In normal and  cells, successful cell division requires accurate duplication of chromosomal DNA. All cells require a multiprotein DNA duplication system (replisomes) for their existence. However, death of normal cells in our body occurs through the apoptotic process. During apoptotic process several crucial genes are downregulated with the upregulation of caspase pathways, leading to ultimate degradation of genomic DNA. In metastatic  cells (SKBR-3, MCF -7, and MDA-462), this process is inhibited to achieve immortality as well as overexpression of the enzymes for the synthesis of marker molecules. It is believed that the GSL of the lacto family such as Le, SA-Le, Le, Le, and Le are markers on the human  and breast  cells. Recently, we have characterized that a few apoptotic chemicals (cis-platin, L-PPMP, D-PDMP, GD3 ganglioside, GD1b ganglioside, , tamoxifen, and melphalan) in low doses kill metastatic breast  cells. The apoptosis-inducing agent (e.g., cis-platin) showed inhibition of DNA polymerase/helicase (part of the replisomes) and also modulated (positively) a few glycolipid-glycosyltransferase (GSL-GLTs) transcriptions in the early stages (within 2 h after treatment) of apoptosis. These Lc-family GSLs are also present on the surfaces of human breast and  carcinoma cells. It is advantageous to deliver these apoptotic chemicals through the metastatic cell surfaces containing high concentration of marker glycolipids (Lc-GSLs). Targeted application of apoptotic chemicals (in micro scale) to kill the  cells would be an ideal way to inhibit the metastatic growth of both breast and  cells. It was observed in three different breast  lines (SKBR-3, MDA-468, and MCF-7) that in 2 h very little apoptotic process had started, but predominant biochemical changes (including inactivation of replisomes) started between 6 and 24 h of the drug treatments. The contents of replisomes (replisomal complexes) during induction of apoptosis are not known. It is known that DNA helicase activities (major proteins catalyze the melting of dsDNA strands) change during apoptotic induction process. Previously DNA Helicase-III was characterized as a component of the replication complexes isolated from carcinoma cells and normal rapid growing embryonic chicken brain cells. Helicase activities were assayed by a novel method (combined immunoprecipitation-ROME assay), and DNA polymerase-alpha activities were determined by regular chain extension of nicked "ACT-DNA," by determining values obtained from +/- aphidicolin added to the incubation mixtures. Very little is known about the stability of the "replication complexes" (or replisomes) during the apoptotic process. DNA helicases are motor proteins that catalyze the melting of genomic DNA during replication, repair, and recombination processes. In all three breast carcinoma cell lines (SKBR-3, MCF-7, and MDA-468), a common trend, decrease of activities of DNA polymerase-alpha and Helicase-III (estimated and detected with a polyclonal antibody), was observed, after cis-platin- and L-PPMP-induced apoptosis. Previously our laboratory has documented downregulation (within 24-48 h) of several GSL-GLTs with these apoptotic reagents in breast and  cells also. Perhaps induced apoptosis would improve the prognosis in metastatic breast and  patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28222613>Phytochemical investigations and antiproliferative secondary metabolites from Thymus alternans growing in Slovakia.</a></h1><p>Thymus alternans Klokov (Lamiaceae) is a neglected species of the genus Thymus (Sect. Serpyllum) endemic to Carpathian area, where it is used as a flavouring agent and for medicinal purposes.The aim of the work was to identify antiproliferative constituents from the flowering aerial parts of this plant.Thymus alternans extracts were analyzed by HPLC-MS and subjected to extensive chromatographic separations. The isolated compounds (phenolics and triterpenes) were structurally elucidated by MS and 1D and 2D NMR experiments. Essential oil (EO) composition was determined by GC-FID and GC-MS. Six purified triterpenes and EO were assayed for in vitro antiproliferative activity against a panel of human  cells, namely, breast (MDA-MB 231),  (HCT-15 and HCT116), lung (U1810), pancreatic (BxPC3), melanoma (A375) and cervical carcinoma (A431) cells.The structures of the isolated compounds were achieved on the basis of H-NMR and MS experiments. Luteolin-4'-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (P1), chrysoeriol-7-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (P2), chrysoeriol-5-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (P3), apigenin-7-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (P4), rosmarinic acid (P5), rosmarinic acid-3'-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (P6), caffeic acid-3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (P7), 3α-hydroxy-urs-12,15-diene (T1), α-amyrin (T2), β-amyrin (T3), isoursenol (T4), epitaraxerol (T5), and oleanolic acid (T6). GC-MS analysis revealed that the EO of T. alternans was devoid of phenols and belonged to the nerolidol-chemotype, that is typical of the Sect. Serpyllum. The six purified triterpenes (T1-T6) were active with IC ranging from 0.5 to 5 μM being comparable or better than those of reference compounds  and cisplatin. The EO exhibited significant effects on A375, MDA-MB 231 and HCT116 cell lines with IC in the range of 5-8 μg/mL.The reported results suggest that T. alternans can be considered as a good source of phytoconstituents with possible importance in the pharmaceutical field.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26422131>Cytotoxic Barrigenol-like Triterpenoids from an Extract of Cyrilla racemiflora Housed in a Repository.</a></h1><p>Two new [(+)-cyrillins A (1) and B (2)] and four known barrigenol-like triterpenoids (3-6), along with  and (+)-3β-O-trans-feruloylbetulinic acid, were isolated from a sample-restricted CH2Cl2-soluble extract of the bark of Cyrilla racemiflora, collected in Dominica. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by interpretation of their spectroscopic data, and the absolute configuration of the cyclic 1,2-diol unit of (+)-cyrillin A (1) was ascertained by analysis of the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectrum induced with [Mo2(OAc)4]. In the case of (+)-cyrillin B (2), which was found to contain a diangeloylated glucose residue, the structure proposed was supported by analysis of its MS(2) and MS(3) spectra. All compounds isolated were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against HT-29 human  cells, and the known compound, (+)-barringtogenol B (3), was found to be the most potent, exhibiting an IC50 value of 1.7 μM. This compound also showed inhibitory activity toward the CCD-112CoN human normal  cell line, with an IC50 value of 5.9 μM, indicating a lack of cytotoxic selectivity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28807224>Mesua ferrea stem bark extract induces apoptosis and inhibits metastasis in human colorectal carcinoma HCT 116 cells, through modulation of multiple cell signalling pathways.</a></h1><p>Considering the great potential of natural products as anticancer agents, the present study was designed to explore the molecular mechanisms responsible for anticancer activities of Mesua ferrea stem bark extract against human colorectal carcinoma. Based on MTT assay results, bioactive sub-fraction (SF-3) was selected for further studies using HCT 116 cells. Repeated column chromatography resulted in isolation of less active α-amyrin from SF-3, which was identified and characterized by GC-MS and HPLC methods. α-amyrin and  contents of SF-3 were measured by HPLC methods. Fluorescent assays revealed characteristic apoptotic features, including cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and marked decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential in SF-3 treated cells. In addition, increased levels of caspases-9 and -3/7 levels were also observed in SF-3 treated cells. SF-3 showed promising antimetastatic properties in multiple in vitro assays. Multi-pathway analysis revealed significant down-regulation of WNT, HIF-1α, and EGFR with simultaneous up-regulation of p53, Myc/Max, and TGF-β signalling pathways in SF-3 treated cells. In addition, promising growth inhibitory effects were observed in SF-3 treated HCT 116 tumour spheroids, which give a hint about in vivo antitumor efficacy of SF-3 phytoconstituents. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that anticancer effects of SF-3 towards  are through modulation of multiple molecular pathways.Copyright © 2017 China Pharmaceutical University.

In this work, the anticancer activity of a rosemary-leaf extract and its fractions were assayed to identify the phenolic compounds responsible for their antiproliferative/cytotoxic effects on a panel of human  cell lines. Bioguided fractionation of the rosemary-leaf extract was achieved by semi-preparative chromatography. The rosemary extract and the compounds in the fractions were characterized and quantified by HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS. Cellular viability in the presence of these fractions and the whole extract was determined after 24 or 48 h incubations by using an MTT assay. Fractions containing diterpenes or triterpenes were the most active but not as much as the whole extract. In conclusion, carnosic acid, carnosol, 12-methoxycarnosic acid, taxodione, hinokione and  were the putative candidates that contributed to the observed antiproliferative activity of rosemary in human  cells. Whether the effects of the extract and fractions are only cytostatic or cytotoxic needs to be elucidated. Nevertheless, the comparative antiproliferative study on the fractions and whole extract revealed potential synergistic effects between several components in the extract that may deserve further attention.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These were screened for their anticancer activity against different  cells and normal human PBMC by MTT assay. Compound 2c [(3S)-3-{2-(4-(hydroxymethyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)acetyloxy}-lup-20(29)-en-28-oic acid] was found as the most potent inhibitor of cell line HT-29 with IC50 value 14.9 μM. Its role as an inducer of apoptosis was investigated in this cell line by Annexin-V/PI binding assay and by following its capability for ROS generation, depolarization of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, activation of caspases, PARP cleavage, nuclear degradation and expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. It exhibited much higher cytotoxicity than the standard drug 5-fluorouracil but showed negligible cytotoxicity towards normal PBMC. Elevated level of ROS generation, activation of caspase 3 and caspase 9, DNA fragmentation, higher expression of Bax and Bad, lower expression of Bcl2 and Bcl-xl, and increased level of Bax/Bcl-xl ratio identified 2c as a promising inducer of apoptosis that follows a mitochondria dependent pathway. Bio-physical studies indicate that compound 2c acts as a minor groove binder to the DNA.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

All the derivatives were evaluated for cytotoxic activity by MTT assay against five different human  cell lines: lung (A549),  (HCT116), prostate (PC3), pancreatic (MIA PaCa-2) and breast (T47D). The data revealed that compounds 11c, 11d, 11g, 11h and 13a possess most promising cytotoxic potential. The compound 11h was one of the most active compounds, with IC values in the range of 4-6µM against all the five  cell lines. The results of this study suggested that derivatives with free -OH (11c, 11d and 11g) and free -COOH (11h and 13a) substitutions in the triazole moiety introduced at the C-28 position significantly improved the anti-tumor activity and may be the favourable position to synthesize potent anticancer leads from BA. Introduction of a non polar alkyl groups at C-28 position (10, 12 and 14) resulted in the significant loss of the activity. Further, DAPI staining, ROS generation and wound healing experiments revealed that compound 11h induces apoptosis in HCT-116 cells.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Current therapies fail to eradicate CSCs and therefore selecting a resistant cell subset that is able to facilitate tumor recurrences.  (BetA) is a broad acting natural compound, shown to induce cell death via the inhibition of the stearoyl-CoA- desaturase (SCD- 1). This enzyme converts saturated fatty acids into unsaturated fatty acids and is over-expressed in tumor cells. Here we show that BetA induces rapid cell death in all  CSCs tested and is able to affect the CSCs directly as shown, via the loss of clonogenic capacity. Similar results were observed with inhibition of SCD-1, suggesting that SCD-1 activity is indeed a vulnerable link in  CSCs and can be considered an ideal target for therapy in .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31395908>Nanoencapsulated  analogue distinctively improves colorectal carcinoma in vitro and in vivo.</a></h1><p>, a plant secondary metabolite, has gained significant attention due to its antiproliferative activity over a range of  cells.

We have studied another mode of PCD, autophagy which is one of the important constituent of cellular catabolic system as well as we also studied proteasomal degradation pathway to investigate whole catabolic pathway after exploration of 2c on HT-29 cells.Mechanism of autophagic cell death was studied using fluorescent dye like acridine orange (AO) and monodansylcadaverin (MDC) staining by using fluorescence microscopy. Various autophagic protein expression levels were determined by Western Blotting, qRT-PCR and Immunostaining. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) was used to study the colocalization of various autophagic proteins. These were accompanied by formation of autophagic vacuoles as revealed by FACS and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Proteasomal degradation pathway was studied by proteasome-Glo™ assay systems using luminometer.The formation of autophagic vacuoles in HT-29 cells after 2c treatment was determined by fluorescence staining--confirming the occurrence of autophagy. In addition, 2c was found to alter expression levels of different autophagic proteins like Beclin-1, Atg 5, Atg 7, Atg 5-Atg 12, LC3B and autophagic adapter protein, p62. Furthermore we found the formation of autophagolysosome by colocalization of LAMP-1 with LC3B, LC3B with Lysosome, p62 with lysosome. Finally, as proteasomal degradation pathway downregulated after 2c treatment colocalization of ubiquitin with lysosome and LC3B with p62 was studied to confirm that protein degradation in autophagy induced HT-29 cells follows autolysosomal pathway.In summary,  analogue, 2c was able to induce autophagy in HT-29 cells and as proteasomal degradation pathway downregulated after 2c treatment so protein degradation in autophagy induced HT-29 cells follows autolysosomal pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847340>Cocrystal Formation of  and Ascorbic Acid: Synthesis, Physico-Chemical Assessment, Antioxidant, and Antiproliferative Activity.</a></h1><p> (BA) was demonstrated to be a very promising anticancer agent against various tumor cell lines such as breast, , lung, and brain. Despite its strong cytotoxic effect,  exhibits low water solubility, feature that is reflected in its poor bioavailability. To overcome these drawbacks, numerous strategies were conducted to improve its physicochemical and pharmacokinetic profile, among which cocrystalization emerged as a promising approach. Thus, our work consisted in obtaining slowly grown cocrystals of BA and ascorbic acid (BA+VitC) in isopropyl alcohol obtained in a hydrothermal experiment. The newly formed cocrystals were characterized by physico-chemical methods such asSEM, DSC, XRPD, and FT-IR spectroscopy demonstrating BA+VitC cocrystal formation while their antioxidant activity revealed an additive antioxidant effect. To investigate the biological effect, BA+VitC cocrystals were tested on HaCat (immortalized human keratinocytes), B164A5 and B16F0 (murine melanoma), MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 (human breast ), and HeLa (cervical ) cell lines.
