We hypothesized that unsaturated FA could alleviate saturated FA-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurring in intestinal secretory goblet cells, and consequently the reduced synthesis and secretion of mucins that form the protective mucus . To investigate this hypothesis, we treated well-differentiated human colonic LS174T goblet cells with palmitic acid (PAL)-the most commonly used inducer of lipotoxicity in in vitro systems-or -9, -6, or -3 unsaturated fatty acids alone or in co-treatment with PAL, and measured the impact of such treatments on ER stress and Muc2 production. Our results showed that only eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids protect goblet cells against ER stress-mediated altered Muc2 secretion induced by PAL, whereas neither linolenic acid nor -9 and -6 FA are able to provide such protection. We conclude that EPA and DHA could represent potential therapeutic nutrients against the detrimental lipotoxicity of saturated fatty acids, associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity or inflammatory bowel disease. These in vitro data remain to be explored in vivo in a context of dietary obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552196>Maintaining  Under Stress: Envelope Stress Response Regulation of Pathogenesis in Gram-Negative Bacteria.</a></h2><p>The Gram-negative bacterial envelope is an essential interface between the intracellular and harsh extracellular environment. Envelope stress responses (ESRs) are crucial to the maintenance of this  and function to detect and respond to perturbations in the envelope, caused by environmental stresses. Pathogenic bacteria are exposed to an array of challenging and stressful conditions during their lifecycle and, in particular, during infection of a host. As such, maintenance of envelope homeostasis is essential to their ability to successfully cause infection. This review will discuss our current understanding of the σ- and Cpx-regulated ESRs, with a specific focus on their role in the virulence of a number of model pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31525444>Topical application of highly concentrated water-in-oil emulsions: Physiological skin parameters and skin penetration in vivo - A pilot study.</a></h2><p>Important aspects in the development of new dermal drug delivery systems are the formulations' physicochemical properties and stability. Moreover, their influence on skin physiology and their penetration performance in vivo are of crucial interest. We have recently developed novel concentrated water-in-oil emulsions based on a non-ionic silicone surfactant; the present study deals with the effect of these formulations on physiological skin parameters of healthy volunteers after repeated application. Variations in skin condition and   were investigated using classical biophysical and spectroscopic techniques. After four weeks of continuous treatment, no signs of skin irritation could be observed. Both tested emulsions had a positive effect on skin properties despite their relatively high water content and low lipid content. In vivo tape stripping studies revealed penetrated amounts of the incorporated model drug fluorescein sodium of almost 50% of the applied dose, with a superior performance of emulsions with isopropyl myristate when compared to liquid paraffin. In summary, our study confirmed the suitability of the developed W/O emulsions for pharmaceutic and cosmetic applications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The  of intestinal  is crucial for the maintenance of liver homeostasis. In this mutual relationship, the liver acts as a second firewall towards potentially harmful substances translocated from the gut, and is, in turn, is implicated in the regulation of the . Increasing evidence has highlighted the relevance of increased intestinal permeability and consequent bacterial translocation in the development of liver damage. In particular, in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease recent hypotheses are considering intestinal permeability impairment, diet and gut dysbiosis as the primary pathogenic trigger. In advanced liver disease, intestinal permeability is enhanced by portal hypertension. The clinical consequence is an increased bacterial translocation that further worsens liver damage. Furthermore, this pathogenic mechanism is implicated in most of liver cirrhosis complications, such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome, portal vein thrombosis, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatocellular carcinoma. After liver transplantation, the decrease in portal pressure should determine beneficial effects on the gut-liver axis, although are incompletely understood data on the modifications of the intestinal permeability and gut microbiota composition are still lacking. How the modulation of the intestinal permeability could prevent the initiation and progression of liver disease is still an uncovered area, which deserves further attention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665423>Identification of Metagenomics Structure and Function Associated With Temporal Changes in Rat (Rattus norvegicus) Skin Microbiome During Health and Cutaneous Burn.</a></h2><p>The cutaneous skin microbiome is host to a vast ensemble of resident microbes that provide essential capabilities including protection of skin   and modulation of the host immune response. Cutaneous burn-injury promotes alteration of cutaneous and systemic immune response that can affect both commensal and pathogenic microbes. A cross-sectional study of a limited number of burn patients revealed a difference in the bacteriome of burned versus control participants. Temporal changes of the skin microbiome during health and cutaneous burn-injury remains largely unknown. Furthermore, how this microbial shift relates to community function in the collective metagenome remain elusive. Due to cost considerations and reduced healing time, rodents are frequently used in burn research, despite inherent physiological differences between rodents and human skin. Using a rat burn model, a longitudinal study was conducted to characterize the rat skin bacterial residents and associated community functions in states of health (n = 30) (sham-burned) and when compromised by burn-injury (n = 24). To address the knowledge gap, traumatic thermal injury and disruption of cutaneous surface is associated with genus-level changes in the microbiota, reduced bacterial richness, and altered representation of bacterial genes and associated predicted functions across different skin microbial communities. These findings demonstrate that, upon burn-injury, there is a shift in diversity of the skin's organismal assemblages, yielding a core microbiome that is distinct at the genome and functional level. Moreover, deviations from the core community correlate with temporal changes post-injury and community transition from the state of cutaneous health to disease (burn-injury).© The Author(s) 2019.

Elevated systemic levels of neutrophils have been detected in patients with altered BBB function, but the role of neutrophils in BMEC dysfunction is unknown. Neutrophils are key players of the immune response and, when activated, produce neutrophil-derived microvesicles (NMV). NMV have been shown to impact the  of endothelial cells throughout the body and we hypothesize that NMV released from circulating neutrophils interact with BMEC and induce endothelial cell dysfunction. Therefore, the current study investigated the interaction of NMV with human BMEC and determined whether they altered gene expression and function in vitro. Using flow cytometry and confocal imaging, NMV were shown to be internalized by the human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 via a variety of energy-dependent mechanisms, including endocytosis and macropinocytosis. The internalization of NMV significantly altered the transcriptomic profile of hCMEC/D3, specifically inducing the dysregulation of genes associated with TJ, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and vesicular transport. Functional studies confirmed NMV significantly increased permeability and decreased the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of a confluent monolayer of hCMEC/D3. These findings indicate that NMV interact with and affect gene expression of BMEC as well as impacting their . We conclude that NMV may play an important role in modulating the permeability of BBB during an infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610731>Bone Marrow-Derived Cells Restore Functional  of the Gut Epithelial and Vascular Barriers in a Model of Diabetes and ACE2 Deficiency.</a></h2><p> There is incomplete knowledge of the impact of bone marrow (BM) cells on the gut microbiome and gut  function.  We postulated that diabetes and systemic angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) deficiency would synergize to adversely impact both the microbiome and gut  function.  Bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing and metatranscriptomic analysis were performed on fecal samples from WT, ACE2, Akita (type 1 diabetic, T1D), and ACE2-Akita mice. Gut   was assessed by immunofluorescence, and BM cell extravasation into the small intestine was evaluated by flow cytometry. In the CE2-Akita or Akita mice, the disrupted  was associated with reduced levels of myeloid angiogenic cells (MACs), but no increase in inflammatory monocytes was observed within the gut parenchyma. Genomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of the microbiome of ACE2-Akita mice demonstrated a marked increase in peptidoglycan (PGN) producing bacteria. When compared to control cohorts treated with saline, intraperitoneal administration of MACs significantly decreased the microbiome gene expression associated with PGN biosynthesis and restored epithelial and endothelial gut  . Also indicative of diabetic gut  dysfunction, increased levels of PGN and intestinal fatty acid binding protein-2 (FABP-2) were observed in plasma of human subjects with T1D (n=21) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D, n=23) compared to non-diabetic controls (n=23). Using human retinal endothelial cells, we determined that PGN activates a non-canonical Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) associated MyD88-ARNO-ARF6 signaling cascade, resulting in destabilization of p120-catenin and internalization of VE-cadherin as a mechanism of deleterious impact of PGN on the endothelium.  We demonstrate for the first time that the defect in gut  function and dysbiosis in CE2-Akita mice can be favorably impacted by exogenous administration of MACs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612457>Nuclear Mechanics and Cancer Cell Migration.</a></h2><p>As a cancer cell invades adjacent tissue, penetrates a basement membrane , or squeezes into a blood capillary, its nucleus can be greatly constricted. Here, we examine: (1) the passive and active deformation of the nucleus during 3D migration; (2) the nuclear structures-namely, the lamina and chromatin-that govern nuclear deformability; (3) the effect of large nuclear deformation on DNA and nuclear factors; and (4) the downstream consequences of mechanically stressing the nucleus. We focus especially on recent studies showing that constricted migration causes nuclear envelope rupture and excess DNA damage, leading to cell cycle suppression, possibly cell death, and ultimately it seems to heritable genomic variation. We first review the latest understanding of nuclear dynamics during cell migration, and then explore the functional effects of nuclear deformation, especially in relation to genome  and potentially cancerous mutations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601371>Long-Term Dabigatran Treatment Delays Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis in the TgCRND8 Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder with important vascular and hemostatic alterations that should be taken into account during diagnosis and treatment.This study evaluates whether anticoagulation with dabigatran, a clinically approved oral direct thrombin inhibitor with a low risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, ameliorates AD pathogenesis in a transgenic mouse model of AD.TgCRND8 AD mice and their wild-type littermates were treated for 1 year with dabigatran etexilate or placebo. Cognition was evaluated using the Barnes maze, and cerebral perfusion was examined by arterial spin labeling. At the molecular level, Western blot and histochemical analyses were performed to analyze fibrin content, amyloid burden, neuroinflammatory activity, and blood-brain  (BBB) .Anticoagulation with dabigatran prevented memory decline, cerebral hypoperfusion, and toxic fibrin deposition in the AD mouse brain. In addition, long-term dabigatran treatment significantly reduced the extent of amyloid plaques, oligomers, phagocytic microglia, and infiltrated T cells by 23.7%, 51.8%, 31.3%, and 32.2%, respectively. Dabigatran anticoagulation also prevented AD-related astrogliosis and pericyte alterations, and maintained expression of the water channel aquaporin-4 at astrocytic perivascular endfeet of the BBB.Long-term anticoagulation with dabigatran inhibited thrombin and the formation of occlusive thrombi in AD; preserved cognition, cerebral perfusion, and BBB function; and ameliorated neuroinflammation and amyloid deposition in AD mice. Our results open a field for future investigation on whether the use of direct oral anticoagulants might be of therapeutic value in AD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

It is well known that an adequate Sertoli cell function is essential to maintain germ cell development. The aim of the present study was to analyze whether G and R are able to affect Sertoli cell functions, such as energy metabolism and blood-testis  (BTB) . Sertoli cell cultures from 20-day-old rats were exposed to 10 and 100 ppm of G or R, doses which do not decrease cell viability. Neither G nor R caused impairment in lactate production or fatty acid oxidation. G and R decreased Transepithelial Electrical Resistance, which indicates the establishment of a Sertoli cell junction . However, neither G nor R modified the expression of claudin11, ZO1 and occludin, proteins that constitute the BTB. Analysis of cellular distribution of claudin11 by immunofluorescence showed that G and R induced a delocalization of the signal from membrane to the cytoplasm. The results suggest that G and R could alter an important function of Sertoli cell such as BTB  and thus they could compromise the normal development of spermatogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Administration of probiotics and prebiotics has been proposed as a convenient and effective treatment. Our study aims to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of  N1115 (N1115) and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) by examining the histopathogenesis and underlying molecular events of NAFLD.An NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding C57BL/6 mice with a high-fat diet (HFD). N1115, FOS and synbiotics were administered for 16 weeks.N1115, FOS and synbiotics alleviated HFD-induced hepatic steato-sis and release of tumor necrosis factor-α, and slowed the progression of cirrhosis. Compared to the HFD group, these dietary supplements reduced serum total triglyceride and cholesterol, and appeared to decrease the fasting blood glucose and insulin. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and real-time PCR showed that the regimens could overcome insulin resistance. These findings were associated with the transcriptional repression of inflammatory factors such as lipopolysaccharides, Toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor-κB. Lastly, N1115, FOS, and synbiotics improved the intestinal  functions and histologic . This was accompanied by the restoration of the p38 MAPK pathway and in-creased expression of the tight junction components occludin-1 and claudin-1.N1115, FOS and synbiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between CS and experimental colitis in a murine model of IBD. It was hypothesized that CS aggravates colonic inflammation due to a change in gut microbiota (GM) composition. C57BL/6 mice, delivered by CS or vaginal delivery (VD), were intra-rectally challenged with oxazolone at 8 weeks of age and monitored for colitis symptoms. The results showed that CS delivered mice experienced an increased body weight loss and colon weight, together with higher colonic concentrations of TNF-α and MPO compared with VD mice. Increased infiltration of inflammatory cells was present in CS delivered mice, as well as a downregulation in expression of the gut  genes occludin and tight junction protein 1 indicative of an impaired  function. The GM from CS delivered mice without colitis partly contributed to the increase in colitis symptoms when inoculated into germ-free recipient mice. In conclusion, CS increased sensitivity to oxazolone induced colitis in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669344>Changes in vascular permeability in the spinal cord contribute to chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.</a></h2><p>Chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain is a dose-limiting side effect of many cancer therapies due to their propensity to accumulate in peripheral nerves, which is facilitated by the permeability of the blood-nerve . Preclinically, the chemotherapy agent vincristine (VCR) activates endothelial cells in the murine peripheral nervous system and in doing so allows the infiltration of monocytes into nerve tissue where they orchestrate the development of VCR-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity. In this study we demonstrate that VCR also activates endothelial cells in the murine central nervous system, increases paracellular permeability and decreases trans endothelial resistance. In in vivo imaging studies in mice, VCR administration results in trafficking of inflammatory monocytes through the endothelium. Indeed, VCR treatment affects the  of the blood-spinal cord- as indicated by Evans Blue extravasation, disrupts tight junction coupling and is accompanied by the presence of monocytes in the spinal cord. Such inflammatory monocytes (Iba-1 CCR2 Ly6C TMEM119 cells) that infiltrate the spinal cord also express the pro-nociceptive cysteine protease Cathepsin S. Systemic treatment with a CNS-penetrant, but not a peripherally-restricted, inhibitor of Cathepsin S prevents the development of VCR-induced hypersensitivity, suggesting that infiltrating monocytes play a functional role in sensitising spinal cord nociceptive neurons. Our findings guide us towards a better understanding of central mechanisms of pain associated with VCR treatment and thus pave the way for the development of innovative antinociceptive strategies.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, we investigated the effect of  and its extracellular vesicles (EVs) on obesity-related genes in microarray datasets and evaluated the cell line and C57BL/6 mice by conducting RT-PCR and ELISA assays. -derived EVs caused a more significant loss in body and fat weight of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, compared with the bacterium itself. Moreover, treatment with  and EVs had significant effects on lipid metabolism and expression of inflammatory markers in adipose tissues. Both treatments improved the intestinal  , inflammation, energy balance, and blood parameters (i.e., lipid profile and glucose level). Our findings showed that -derived EVs contain various biomolecules, which can have a positive impact on obesity by affecting the involved genes. Also, our results showed that  and its EVs had a significant relationship with intestinal homeostasis, which highlights their positive role in obesity treatment.

Previous studies blocking the type I IFN pathway systemically in lupus models showed some beneficial effects. However, its effects on neuropsychiatric manifestations have yet to be carefully assessed, even though IFNα has been associated with induction of depression. Our aim was to investigate whether disrupting the type I IFN pathway would attenuate the development of murine neuropsychiatric lupus.Female MRL/ mice were administered an antitype I IFN receptor (IFNAR) antibody or a control antibody intraperitoneally three times weekly for 12 weeks starting at age 4-5 weeks. Behavior was assessed during and at the end of the treatment schedule.No significant differences were seen between the anti-IFNAR- and control-treated mice when assessing for depression-like behavior or cognitive dysfunction, although anti-IFNAR antibody-treated mice displayed significant decreases in levels of IFN-stimulated genes. Anti-IFNAR treatment also did not significantly improve brain histology, cellular infiltration, or blood-brain  .Surprisingly, our results showed no improvement in neuropsychiatric disease and suggest that the role of IFNAR signaling in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric lupus continues to need to be carefully assessed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576180>In vitro safety and performance evaluation of a seawater solution enriched with copper, hyaluronic acid, and eucalyptus for nasal lavage.</a></h2><p>The common cold is a viral infectious disease with symptoms such as runny nose, sore throat, and mainly, nasal congestion. State-of-the-art therapeutic approaches focus on alleviating the symptoms of this disease by non-invasive and simple-to-use methods. Nasal irrigation is one of the most accepted approaches to ease nasal congestion which, if left untreated, has a negative impact on the quality of life of patients.In this study, the safety and efficacy of a novel hypertonic seawater solution for nasal lavage enriched with hyaluronic acids, eucalyptus oil, copper, and manganese salts (Stérimar Stop & Protect Cold and Flu; SSPCF) have been investigated in vitro.An in vitro 3D reconstituted human nasal epithelium tissue model, MucilAir™, has been used in this study to investigate the safety of SSPCF on nasal epithelium by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion. The efficacy of SSPCF was measured by mucociliary clearance (MCC), ATP release, Alcian blue and aquaporin (AQP3) stainings.SSPCF treatment respected nasal epithelium tissue  and enhanced  function without inducing a cytotoxic response. Secreted LDH and IL-8 levels were similar to untreated controls. MCC rate was increased 2.5-fold and ATP release decreased 87% upon SSPCF treatment, indicating improved decongestion activity. SSPCF treatment after hypotonic stress helped recover cellular organization, as shown by Alcian blue and AQP3 staining assays.SSPCF appears as a safe and effective nasal irrigation formula that may alleviate the symptoms associated with common cold such as nasal congestion.© 2019 Huang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660028>Gut-liver axis signaling in portal hypertension.</a></h2><p>Portal hypertension (PHT) in advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) results from increased intrahepatic resistance caused by pathologic changes of liver tissue composition (structural component) and intrahepatic vasoconstriction (functional component). PHT is an important driver of hepatic decompensation such as development of ascites or variceal bleeding. Dysbiosis and an impaired intestinal  in ACLD facilitate translocation of bacteria and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that promote disease progression  immune system activation with subsequent induction of proinflammatory and profibrogenic pathways. Congestive portal venous blood flow represents a critical pathophysiological mechanism linking PHT to increased intestinal permeability: The intestinal  function is affected by impaired microcirculation, neoangiogenesis, and abnormal vascular and mucosal permeability. The close bidirectional relationship between the gut and the liver has been termed "gut-liver axis". Treatment strategies targeting the gut-liver axis by modulation of microbiota composition and function, intestinal  , as well as amelioration of liver fibrosis and PHT are supposed to exert beneficial effects. The activation of the farnesoid X receptor in the liver and the gut was associated with beneficial effects in animal experiments, however, further studies regarding efficacy and safety of pharmacological FXR modulation in patients with ACLD are needed. In this review, we summarize the clinical impact of PHT on the course of liver disease, discuss the underlying pathophysiological link of PHT to gut-liver axis signaling, and provide insight into molecular mechanisms that may represent novel therapeutic targets.©The Author(s) 2019.

Therefore, brain energy metabolism may represent a new therapeutic target for AD medical interventions. Among nutrients providing energy, glucose, the primary energy source, cannot cross the blood-brain  freely without specific glucose transporters (GLUTs), which are essential for the maintenance of cerebral energy metabolism homeostasis. Several converging lines of evidence suggest that GLUT1 deficiency in mice leads to synapse reduction and dysregulation coupled with mitochondrial morphological changes. In this study, the results revealed that regular exercise (RE) decreased the expression of amyloid-β and phosphorylated tau by western blot, and enhanced the spatial learning and exploration ability of AD model mice as assessed by Morris water maze test. Mitochondrial cristae and edges were clear and intact, ATP production in the brain raised, the number of synapses increased, and GLUT1 and GLUT3 expression levels improved in the central nervous system (CNS) in AD model mice after RE. Changes in GLUT1 and GLUT3 expression at the protein level after RE are an important part of energy metabolic adaptation in AD model mice. Learning and memory improvement are highly associated with mitochondrial  and sufficient synapses in the CNS. This research suggests that increased brain energy metabolism attributed to RE exhibits promising therapeutic potential for AD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660564>Evolution of intrinsic vacancies and prolonged lifetimes of vacancy clusters in black phosphorene.</a></h2><p>Due to the relatively low formation energies and highly mobile characteristics of atomic vacancies in phosphorene, understanding their evolution becomes crucial for its structural , chemical activities and applications. Herein, by combining first-principles calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate the time evolution and formation of atomic vacancy clusters from isolated monovacancies (MVs), aiming to uncover the mechanisms of diffusion, annihilation, and reaction of these atomic vacancies. We find that while isolated MVs possess a highly mobile characteristic, they react and form MV pairs which possess much lower mobility and high stability under ambient conditions. We also show that the disappearance of MVs at the edge is quite slow due to the relatively high energy , and as a result, around 80% of MVs remain even after two years under ambient conditions. Our findings on one hand provide useful information for the structural repairing of phosphorene through chemical functionalization of these vacancy clusters, and on the other hand, suggest that these rather stable vacancy clusters may be used as activated catalysts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632236>Pre- and Post-natal High Fat Feeding Differentially Affects the Structure and  of the Neurovascular Unit of 16-Month Old Male and Female Mice.</a></h2><p>Compelling experimental and clinical evidence supports a role for maternal obesity in offspring health. Adult children of obese mothers are at greater risk of obesity, diabetes, coronary heart disease and stroke. These offspring may also be at greater risk of age-related neurodegenerative diseases for which mid-life obesity is a risk factor. Rodent diet-induced obesity models have shown that high fat (HF) diet consumption damages the  of the blood-brain  (BBB) in the adult brain. However, there is currently little information about the effect of chronic HF feeding on the BBB of aged animals. Moreover, the long-term consequences of maternal obesity on the cerebrovasculature of aged offspring are not known. This study determined the impact of pre- and post-natal HF diet on the structure and  of cerebral blood vessels in aged male and female mice. Female C57Bl/6 mice were fed either a 10% fat control (C) or 45% HF diet before mating and during gestation and lactation. At weaning, male and female offspring were fed the C or HF diet until sacrifice at 16-months of age. Both dams and offspring fed the HF diet weighed significantly more than mice fed the C diet. Post-natal HF diet exposure increased hippocampal BBB leakiness in female offspring, in association with loss of astrocyte endfoot coverage of arteries. Markers of tight junctions, pericytes or smooth muscle cells were not altered by pre- or post-natal HF diet. Male offspring born to HF-fed mothers showed decreased parenchymal GFAP expression compared to offspring of mothers fed C diet, while microglial and macrophage markers were higher in the same female diet group. In addition, female offspring exposed to the HF diet for their entire lifespan showed more significant changes in vessel structure, BBB permeability and inflammation compared to male animals. These results suggest that the long-term impact of prenatal HF diet on the  of cerebral blood vessels differs between male and female offspring depending on the post-natal diet. This may have implications for the prevention and management of age- and obesity-related cerebrovascular diseases that differentially affect men and women.Copyright © 2019 Contu, Nizari, Heath and Hawkes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667008>Modelling Macular Edema: The Effect of IL-6 and IL-6R Blockade on Human Blood-Retinal   In Vitro.</a></h2><p>Macular edema (ME) is a leading cause of visual loss in a range of retinal diseases and despite the use of antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents, its successful treatment remains a major clinical challenge. Based on the indirect clinical evidence that interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key additional candidate mediator of ME, we interrogated the effect of IL-6 on blood-retinal  (BRB)  in vitro.Human retinal pigment epithelial cell (ARPE-19) and human retinal microvascular endothelial cell (HRMEC) monolayers were used to mimic the outer and inner BRB, respectively. Their paracellular permeability was assessed by measuring the passive permeation of 40 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran across confluent cells in the presence of IL-6. Transendothelial/epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) then was measured and the distribution of the tight junction protein ZO-1 was assessed by immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy.Treatment with IL-6 for 48 hours significantly increased the diffusion rate of FITC-dextran, decreased TEER, and disrupted the distribution of ZO-1 in ARPE-19 cells, which constitutively express the IL-6 transmembrane receptor, and this was reversed with IL-6R blockade. In contrast, IL-6 did not affect the paracellular permeability, TEER, or ZO-1 distribution in HRMECs.These in vitro data support the hypothesis that IL-6 reversibly disrupts the  of ARPE-19 cells, but it does not affect HRMECs.IL-6 is a candidate therapeutic target in the treatment of outer BRB driven ME.Copyright 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31488505>Ubiquitin-based modifications in endothelial cell-cell contact and inflammation.</a></h2><p>Endothelial cell-cell contacts are essential for vascular  and physiology, protecting tissues and organs from edema and uncontrolled invasion of inflammatory cells. The vascular endothelial  is dynamic, but its  is preserved through a tight control at different levels. Inflammatory cytokines and G-protein-coupled receptor agonists, such as histamine, reduce endothelial  and increase vascular leakage. This is due to elevated myosin-based contractility, in conjunction with phosphorylation of proteins at cell-cell contacts. Conversely, reducing contractility stabilizes or even increases endothelial junctional . Rho GTPases are key regulators of such cytoskeletal dynamics and endothelial cell-cell contacts. In addition to signaling-induced regulation, the expression of junctional proteins, such as occludin, claudins and vascular endothelial cadherin, also controls endothelial  function. There is increasing evidence that, in addition to protein phosphorylation, ubiquitylation (also known as ubiquitination) is an important and dynamic post-translational modification that regulates Rho GTPases, junctional proteins and, consequently, endothelial  function. In this Review, we discuss the emerging role of ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation events in endothelial  and inflammation. The picture that emerges is one of increasing complexity, which is both fascinating and promising given the clinical relevance of vascular  in the control of inflammation, and of tissue and organ damage.© 2019.

It has been shown that the sequestration of the parasite infected red blood cells that interact with cerebral vessel endothelial cells and the damage of the blood-brain  (BBB) play critical roles in the pathogenesis. In this study, we developed a ferritin nanozyme (Fenozyme) composed of recombinant human ferritin (HFn) protein shells that specifically target to BBB endothelial cells (BBB ECs), and inner Fe3O4 nanozyme core that exhibits reactive oxygen species-scavenging catalase-like activity. In the experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) mouse model, administration of the Fenozyme, but not HFn, markedly ameliorated the damage of BBB induced by the parasite and improved the survival rate of infected mice significantly. Further investigations found that Fenozyme, as well as HFn, was able to polarize the macrophages in liver to M1 phenotype and promote the elimination of malaria in the blood. Thus, the catalase-like activity of the Fenozyme is required for its therapeutic effect in the mouse model. Moreover, the Fenozyme significantly alleviated the brain inflammation and memory impairment in ECM mice that had been treated with artemether, indicating that combining Fenozyme with anti-malaria drug is a novel strategy for the treatment of cerebral malaria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31465738>The role of Desmoglein 1 in gap junction turnover revealed through the study of SAM syndrome.</a></h2><p>An effective epidermal  requires structural and functional integration of adherens junctions, tight junctions, gap junctions (GJ), and desmosomes. Desmosomes govern epidermal  while GJs facilitate small molecule transfer across cell membranes. Some patients with Severe dermatitis, multiple Allergies, and Metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome, caused by biallelic Desmoglein 1 (DSG1) mutations, exhibit skin lesions reminiscent of Erythrokeratodermia Variabilis, caused by mutations in Connexin genes (Cxs). We therefore examined whether SAM syndrome-causing DSG1 mutations interfere with Cx expression and GJ function. Lesional skin biopsies from SAM syndrome patients (n=7) revealed decreased Dsg1 and Cx43 plasma membrane localization compared with control and non-lesional skin. Cultured keratinocytes and organotypic skin equivalents depleted of Dsg1 exhibited reduced Cx43 expression, rescued upon re-introduction of wild-type Dsg1, but not Dsg1 constructs modeling SAM syndrome-causing mutations. Ectopic Dsg1 expression increased cell-cell dye transfer, which Cx43 silencing inhibited, suggesting Dsg1 promotes GJ function through Cx43. As GJA1 gene expression was not decreased upon Dsg1 loss, we hypothesized that Cx43 reduction was due to enhanced protein degradation. Supporting this, PKC-dependent Cx43 S368 phosphorylation, which signals Cx43 turnover, increased after Dsg1 depletion, while lysosomal inhibition restored Cx43 levels. These data reveal a role for Dsg1 in regulating epidermal Cx43 turnover.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The rd9 RPGR-ORF15 mutation in mice causes lack of the protein in photoreceptors and a slow degeneration of these cells with consequent decrease in Outer Nuclear Layer (ONL) thickness and amplitude of ERG responses, as previously described (Thompson et al., 2012). However, relative rates of rod and cone photoreceptor loss, as well as secondary alterations occurring in neuronal and non-neuronal retinal cell types of rd9 mutants remain to be assessed. Aim of this study is to extend phenotype analysis of the rd9 mouse retina focusing on changes occurring in cells directly interacting with photoreceptors. To this purpose, first we estimated rod and cone survival and its degree of intraretinal variation over time; then, we studied the morphology of horizontal and bipolar cells and of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), extending our observations to glial cell reactivity. We found that in rd9 retinas rod (but not cone) death is the main cause of decrease in ONL thickness and that degeneration shows a high degree of intraretinal variation. Rod loss drives remodeling in the outer retina, with sprouting of second-order neurons of the rod-pathway and relative sparing of cone pathway elements. Remarkably, despite cone survival, functional defects can be clearly detected in ERG recordings in both scotopic and photopic conditions. Moderate levels of Muller cells and microglial reactivity are sided by striking attenuation of staining for RPE tight junctions, suggesting altered  of the outer Blood Retina  (BRB). Because of many features resembling slowly progressing photoreceptor degeneration paradigms or early stages of more aggressive forms of RP, the rd9 mouse model can be considered a rare and useful tool to investigate retinal changes associated to a process of photoreceptor death sustained throughout life and to reveal disease biomarkers (e.g., BRB alterations) of human XLRP.Copyright © 2019 Falasconi, Biagioni, Novelli, Piano, Gargini and Strettoi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586306>The mechanobiology of tight junctions.</a></h2><p>Tight junctions (TJ) play a central role in the homeostasis of epithelial and endothelial tissues, by providing a semipermeable  to ions and solutes, by contributing to the maintenance of cell polarity, and by functioning as signaling platforms. TJ are associated with the actomyosin and microtubule cytoskeletons, and the crosstalk with the cytoskeleton is fundamental for junction biogenesis and . TJ are spatially and functionally connected to adherens junctions (AJ), which are essential for the maintenance of tissue integrity. Mechano-sensing and mechano-transduction properties of several AJ proteins have been characterized during the last decade. However, little is known about how mechanical forces act on TJ and their proteins, how TJ control the mechanical properties of cells and tissues, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms.

The traced ISF from the caudate nucleus drained to the ipsilateral cortex along myelin fiber tracts, while in the opposite direction, its movement to the adjacent thalamus was completely impeded by a  structure, which was identified as the converged, compact myelin fascicle. The regulating and the  effects of myelin were unchanged in AQP4-knockout rats but were impaired as the integrity of boundary structure of drainage system was destroyed in a demyelinated rat model. We thus proposed that the brain homeostasis was maintained within each ISF drainage division locally, rather than across the brain as a whole. A new brain division system and a new pathogenic mechanism of demyelination are therefore proposed.Copyright: © 2019 Wang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542608>Complement activation on neutrophils initiates endothelial adhesion and extravasation.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils are essential to the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases. In the autoantibody-mediated K/BxN model of inflammatory arthritis, the alternative pathway (AP) of complement and Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) are required for disease development while the classical pathway is dispensable. The reason for this differential requirement is unknown. We show that within minutes of K/BxN serum injection complement activation (CA) is detected on circulating neutrophils, as evidenced by cell surface C3 fragment deposition. CA requires the AP factor B and FcγRs but not C4, implying that engagement of FcγRs by autoantibody or immune complexes directly triggers AP C3 convertase assembly. The absence of C5 does not prevent CA on neutrophils but diminishes the upregulation of adhesion molecules. In vivo two-photon microscopy reveals that CA on neutrophils is critical for neutrophil extravasation and generation of C5a at the site of inflammation. C5a stimulates the release of neutrophil proteases, which contribute to the degradation of VE-cadherin, an adherens junction protein that regulates endothelial  . C5a receptor antagonism blocks the extracellular release of neutrophil proteases, suppressing VE-cadherin degradation and neutrophil transendothelial migration in vivo. These results elucidate the AP-dependent intravascular neutrophil-endothelial interactions that initiate the inflammatory cascade in this disease model but may be generalizable to neutrophil extravasation in other inflammatory processes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Also the LG3/4/5-peptide from laminin-α2 chain also promotes BTB  which is likely being used for the assembly of a "new" BTB behind preleptotene spermatocytes under transport at the immunological .

Metformin is reported to have an antioxidant effect; however, the precise role of metformin in obesity-induced male infertility remains unknown. The current study is aimed at exploring the effects of metformin and characterizing its underlying mechanism in the fertility of obese males.An obese male mouse model was generated by feeding mice with a high-fat diet; then, the mice were administered metformin in water for 8 weeks. Reproductive ability, metabolic parameters, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were assessed by cohabitation, enzymatic methods, and ELISA, respectively. Damage to the  of the blood-testis  (BTB), which ensures spermatogenesis, was assessed by transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence with a biotin tracer. Malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were employed for the assessments of oxidative stress. BTB-related proteins were measured by immunoblotting. Nuclear factor B (NF-B) was assessed by immunofluorescence.High-fat-diet-fed mice presented evident lipid metabolic disturbances, disrupted BTB , and decreased reproductive function. Metformin alleviated the decrease in male fertility, decreased ectopic lipid deposition in the testis, and increased serum FSH levels. A further mechanistic analysis revealed that metformin ameliorated the high-fat-diet-induced injury to the BTB structure and permeability and restored the disordered BTB-related proteins, which might be associated with an improvement in oxidative stress and a recovery of NF-B activity in Sertoli cells (SCs).Metformin improves obese male fertility by alleviating oxidative stress-induced BTB damage. These findings provide new insights into the effect of metformin on various diseases and suggest future possibilities in the treatment of male infertility.Copyright © 2019 Jifeng Ye et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497019>Immunological Regulation of Vascular Inflammation During Cancer Metastasis.</a></h2><p>Metastasis is the predominant cause of cancer-related mortality, despite being a highly inefficient process overall. The vasculature is the gatekeeper for tumor cell seeding within the secondary tissue microenvironment-the rate limiting step of the metastatic cascade. Therefore, factors that regulate vascular physiology dramatically influence cancer outcomes. There are a myriad of physiologic circumstances that not only influence the intrinsic capacity of tumor cells to cross the endothelial , but also that regulate vascular inflammation and   to enable extravasation into the metastatic niche. These processes are highly dependent on inflammatory cues largely initiated by the innate immune compartment, that are meant to help re-establish tissue homeostasis, but instead become hijacked by cancer cells. Here, we discuss the scientific advances in understanding the interactions between innate immune cells and the endothelium, describe their influence on cancer metastasis, and evaluate potential therapeutic interventions for the alleviation of metastatic disease. By triangulating the relationship between immune cells, endothelial cells, and tumor cells, we will gain greater insight into how to impede the metastatic process by focusing on its most vulnerable phases, thereby reducing metastatic spread and cancer-related mortality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31538163>The ameliorative effect of the Pyracantha fortuneana (Maxim.) H. L. Li extract on intestinal  dysfunction through modulating glycolipid digestion and gut microbiota in high fat diet-fed rats.</a></h2><p>Pyracantha fortuneana fruits are consumed as a dietary supplement in China and attenuate obesity and metabolic disorders. Obesity is known to be associated with intestinal  dysfunction driven by hyperglycemia and gut dysbiosis. However, whether the health benefits of P. fortuneana fruits are linked with the intestinal  function (IBF) remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the restorative effects of P. fortuneana fruit extract (PFE) on the IBF. Sprague Dawley rats were fed with a chow, a high-fat diet (HFD), or a PFE-supplemented diet for 8 weeks. Results showed that PFE intervention ameliorated HFD-induced intestinal  dysfunction by attenuating impaired structural , reducing the elevated lactulose/mannitol ratio, and improving the mRNA and protein expression levels of tight junction proteins in HFD-fed rats. The ameliorations were associated with a beneficial effect on glycolipid homeostasis, as evidenced from the PFE decreasing intestinal absorptive capacity based on the d-xylose excretory rate, lowering the expression of GLUT2 and inhibiting digestive enzyme activities. The proanthocyanidins in the PFE showed greater in vitro inhibition on α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and lipase compared with triterpenoid saponins. Furthermore, the ameliorations on the IBF were also associated with effects on the microbial composition based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Several bacterial groups, which were linked with gut  , were modulated after PFE administration, that is, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidaceae, Corynebacteriaceae, Lactobacillaceae, and S24-7 were elevated and the HFD-induced increase in Clostridia, Ruminococcaceae, Oscillospira, and Flexispira was restored. These data provide evidence for the ameliorative effect of the PFE on diet-induced intestinal  functional alternations in association with its capacity to modulate glycolipid digestion and gut microbiota in HFD-fed obese rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673119>Optimal Inhibition of Choroidal Neovascularization by scAAV2 with VMD2 Promoter-driven Active Rap1a in the RPE.</a></h2><p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a multifactorial chronic disease that requires long term treatment. Gene therapy is being considered as a promising tool to treat AMD. We found that increased activation of Rap1a in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) reduces oxidative signaling to maintain   of the RPE and resist neural sensory retinal angiogenesis from choroidal endothelial cell invasion. To optimally deliver constitutively active Rap1a (CARap1a) into the RPE of wild type mice, self-complementary AAV2 (scAAV2) vectors driven by two different promoters, RPE65 or VMD2, were generated and tested for optimal active Rap1a expression and inhibition of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) induced by laser injury. scAAV2-VMD2, but not scAAV2-RPE65, specifically and efficiently transduced the RPE to increase active Rap1a protein in the RPE. Mice with increased Rap1a from the scAAV2-VMD2-CARap1a had a significant reduction in CNV compared to controls. Increased active Rap1a in the RPE in vivo or in vitro inhibited inflammatory and angiogenic signaling determined by decreased activation of NF-κB and expression of VEGF without causing increased cell death or autophagy measured by increased LCA3/B. Our study provides a potential future strategy to deliver active Rap1a to the RPE in order to protect against both atrophic and neovascular AMD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31476608>Fish oil supplementation to a high-fat diet improves both intestinal health and the systemic obese phenotype.</a></h2><p>Impaired intestinal health characterized by a dysbiotic microbial community and a dysfunctional epithelial  contributes to host inflammation and metabolic dysfunction in obesity. Fish oil (FO)-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to improve aspects of the obese phenotype; however, their effect on obese intestinal health is unknown. This study aimed to determine the effect of dietary FO on the intestinal microenvironment, including the microbial community and epithelial , in a mouse model of high-fat diet induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed (12 weeks) either a high-fat diet (HF, 60% fat as kcal) or an isocaloric HF supplemented with Menhaden FO (5.3% kcal, HF + FO). 16S rRNA sequencing was used to determine changes in fecal microbiota. Intestinal (ileum and colon) and epididymal adipose tissue RNA was used to assess biomarkers of   and inflammatory status, respectively. Serum was used to assess adipokine concentrations and insulin resistance. HF + FO diet altered the fecal microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Firmicutes and increasing the abundance of members of the Bacteroidetes phyla, as well as increasing the abundance of antiobesogenic Akkermansia muciniphila, compared to HF. Intestinal epithelial  functions were improved by HF + FO evidenced by increased mRNA expression of tight junction components, antimicrobial defenses and mucus  components. HF + FO-fed mice exhibited improvements in homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, oral glucose tolerance and serum adipokine concentrations and epididymal mRNA expression (increased adiponectin and decreased leptin) versus HF. HF + FO improved obese intestinal health and attenuated metabolic dysfunction associated with obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have addressed ITN ownership, insecticide resistance, and frequency of ITN use as possible contributing factors to the high prevalence of malaria infection despite high ITN coverage, but have rarely considered whether the condition of the ITN, or how many people use it, impacts efficacy. This study assessed how ITN , ITN age, and the number of persons sharing a net might mitigate or reduce protective efficacy among self-identified ITN users in Malawi.From 2012 to 2014, six cross-sectional surveys were conducted in both the rainy and dry seasons in southern Malawi. Data were collected on ITN use,  (number and size of holes), and age. Blood samples for detecting Plasmodium falciparum infection were obtained from reported ITN users over 6 months of age. Generalized linear mixed models were used to account for clustering at the household and community level. The final model controlled for gender, household eaves, and community-level infection prevalence during the rainy season.There were 9646 ITN users with blood samples across six surveys, 15% of whom tested positive for P. falciparum infection. Among children under 5 years old, there was a 50% increased odds of P. falciparum infection among those sleeping under an ITN older than two years, compared to those using an ITN less than 2 years old (OR = 1.50; 95% CI 1.07-2.08). ITN  and number of individuals sharing an ITN were not associated with P. falciparum infection.Older ITNs were associated with higher rates of P. falciparum in young children, which may indicate that insecticide concentrations play a larger role in infection prevention than the physical  of an ITN. ITN use was self-reported and the  measures lacked the precision of newer methods, suggesting a need for objective measures of ITN use and more precise assessment of ITN .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619074>Effect of both selenium and biosynthesized nanoselenium particles on cadmium-induced neurotoxicity in albino rats.</a></h2><p>Because cadmium (Cd) is not naturally degradable by ecosystems, it interferes with many types of food chains. Cd accumulates in the kidney, liver and in the nervous tissues, especially the brain. The neurotoxicity of Cd is very high, as it alters the , and increases the permeability, of the blood-brain . Cd penetrates and accumulates in neurons in the brains of rats. This study reveals that Cd decreases antioxidant enzymes and increases oxidative stress in the brain. In addition, Cd increases lipid peroxidation of brain tissues. Cd increases the expression of the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene. It also affects cholinergic, glutamatergic, gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABAergic), dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine neurotransmitters in brain tissue. Consequently, Cd increases the formation of amyloid β, a neurotoxic index, and induces apoptosis by changing the quality and the quantity of Bcl-2, Bax and p53 proteins. In conclusion, both selenium and nanoselenium show potential antioxidant activity and promote recovery from the neurotoxic action of Cd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562318>TFF3 interacts with LINGO2 to regulate EGFR activation for protection against colitis and gastrointestinal helminths.</a></h2><p>Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) have important functions in nutrient absorption,  , regeneration, pathogen-sensing, and mucus secretion. Goblet cells are a specialized cell type of IEC that secrete Trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) to regulate mucus viscosity and wound healing, but whether TFF3-responsiveness requires a receptor is unclear. Here, we show that leucine rich repeat receptor and nogo-interacting protein 2 (LINGO2) is essential for TFF3-mediated functions. LINGO2 immunoprecipitates with TFF3, co-localizes with TFF3 on the cell membrane of IEC, and allows TFF3 to block apoptosis. We further show that TFF3-LINGO2 interactions disrupt EGFR-LINGO2 complexes resulting in enhanced EGFR signaling. Excessive basal EGFR activation in Lingo2 deficient mice increases disease severity during colitis and augments immunity against helminth infection. Conversely, TFF3 deficiency reduces helminth immunity. Thus, TFF3-LINGO2 interactions de-repress inhibitory LINGO2-EGFR complexes, allowing TFF3 to drive wound healing and immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619276>Disruption of gut  and permeability contributes to enteritis in a fish-parasite model: a story told from serum metabolomics.</a></h2><p>In the animal production sector, enteritis is responsible for serious economic losses, and intestinal parasitism is a major stress factor leading to malnutrition and lowered performance and animal production efficiency. The effect of enteric parasites on the gut function of teleost fish, which represent the most ancient bony vertebrates, is far from being understood. The intestinal myxozoan parasite Enteromyxum leei dwells between gut epithelial cells and causes severe enteritis in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), anorexia, cachexia, growth impairment, reduced marketability and increased mortality.This study aimed to outline the gut failure in this fish-parasite model using a multifaceted approach and to find and validate non-lethal serum markers of gut  dysfunction. Intestinal  was studied in parasitized and non-parasitized fish by immunohistochemistry with specific markers for cellular adhesion (E-cadherin) and tight junctions (Tjp1 and Cldn3) and by functional studies of permeability (oral administration of FITC-dextran) and electrophysiology (Ussing chambers). Serum samples from parasitized and non-parasitized fish were analyzed using non-targeted metabolomics and some significantly altered metabolites were selected to be validated using commercial kits.The immunodetection of Tjp1 and Cldn3 was significantly lower in the intestine of parasitized fish, while no strong differences were found in E-cadherin. Parasitized fish showed a significant increase in paracellular uptake measured by FITC-dextran detection in serum. Electrophysiology showed a decrease in transepithelial resistance in infected animals, which showed a diarrheic profile. Serum metabolomics revealed 3702 ions, from which the differential expression of 20 identified compounds significantly separated control from infected groups in multivariate analyses. Of these compounds, serum inosine (decreased) and creatine (increased) were identified as relevant and validated with commercial kits.The results demonstrate the disruption of tight junctions and the loss of gut  function, a metabolomic profile of absorption dysfunction and anorexia, which further outline the pathophysiological effects of E. leei.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628054>Metabolite-Sensing Receptor Ffar2 Regulates Colonic Group 3 Innate Lymphoid Cells and Gut Immunity.</a></h2><p>Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) sense environmental signals that are critical for gut homeostasis and host defense. However, the metabolite-sensing G-protein-coupled receptors that regulate colonic ILC3s remain poorly understood. We found that colonic ILC3s expressed Ffar2, a microbial metabolite-sensing receptor, and that Ffar2 agonism promoted ILC3 expansion and function. Deficiency of Ffar2 in ILC3s decreased their in situ proliferation and ILC3-derived interleukin-22 (IL-22) production. This led to impaired gut epithelial function characterized by altered mucus-associated proteins and antimicrobial peptides and increased susceptibility to colonic injury and bacterial infection. Ffar2 increased IL-22 CCR6 ILC3s and influenced ILC3 abundance in colonic lymphoid tissues. Ffar2 agonism differentially activated AKT or ERK signaling and increased ILC3-derived IL-22 via an AKT and STAT3 axis. Our findings suggest that Ffar2 regulates colonic ILC3 proliferation and function, and they identify an ILC3-receptor signaling pathway modulating gut homeostasis and pathogen defense.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Graphene evoked an extraordinary interest among scientific community regarding biomedical potential including drug/ gene delivery, fluorescent labelling of target analytes, tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, MRI contrast enhancement and so on. Even then; due to very limited data availability about its toxicity, an effort was made to study the bio-nano interactions of pluronic functionalised reduced graphene oxide in animal models. The present study has aimed at evaluating the systemic toxicity and blood brain  integrity due to acute exposure of 10mg/kg rGO-P in Swiss Albino mice. Prolonged exposure; if leading to any signs of toxic symptoms was evaluated by analysing feto-placental transmission and associated developmental neurotoxicity after intravenous administration of 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg body weight of rGO-P in female Wistar rats. Biodistribution analysis using confocal Raman mapping indicates that very trace amounts of rGO-P was found to get accumulated in major organs of both dams and pups, which did not evoke any toxic response. Accumulation of rGO-P in various tissue of rat pups born to treated dams indicated an ample evidence of feto-placental transmission. The present study clearly suggests that rGO-P is non-toxic under any of the experimental conditions. These findings can therefore be elucidated for drug/gene delivery, early prognosis and treatment of various diseases in neonates and adults. Hence the results of the study entrust that rGO-P is an auspicious and promising material for future healthcare applications.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588474>Meat proteins in a high-fat diet have a substantial impact on intestinal barriers through mucus layer and tight junction protein suppression in C57BL/6J mice.</a></h2><p>Protein diets are well known for body maintenance and weight loss. However, it remains unclear whether and how different protein sources affect the intestinal epithelial integrity through tight junctions, mucus secretions and host immunity in diet-induced obesity. To evaluate possible effects, soybean, chicken and pork proteins either with low fat (12% kcal) or high fat (60% kcal) were administered to C57BL/6J mice for 12 weeks. Muc2 expression, tight junction proteins, goblet cells, and inflammatory cytokines in the colon and serum were measured. The intake of a high-fat pork protein diet decreased the number of goblet cells and inhibited Muc2 expression in the colon, which impaired the mucus . Immunohistochemistry indicated decreased crypt depth and downregulation of tight junction proteins in high-fat diet fed mice, signifying losses of epithelial barriers. In addition, a pork protein diet reduces the key zonula occludens-1 and E-cadherin proteins. A high-fat meat protein diet induces colonic inflammatory injury by upregulating several key cytokines and increasing IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 and IFN-γ concentrations in serum.

Conversely, its therapeutic administration decreases their development.A. muciniphila exerts a key role in the maintenance of intestinal health and in host metabolic modulation.

However, the potential neuroprotective mechanism of cystatin C in ischemic brain injury remains unclear. Our study hypothesized that cystatin C can ameliorate blood-brain  (BBB) disruption by upregulating caveolin-1 expression, thereby improving neurological outcomes in cerebral ischemic injury. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence staining, and immunoprecipitation were performed to investigate target proteins. Evans Blue and gelatin zymography were used to examine the effect of cystatin C on BBB disruption. Plasmid and small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection was used to observe alterations in caveolin-1 and occludin expression induced by changes in cystatin C expression. Intriguingly, our study showed that the expression of both cystatin C and caveolin-1 was increased in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-injured mice, and pretreatment with exogenous cystatin C significantly increased caveolin-1 expression, reduced Evans Blue leakage in the injured brain region, and decreased the enzymatic activity of matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9). Meanwhile, our study also showed that the overexpression of cystatin C greatly enhanced caveolin-1 expression, which later increased occludin expression in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-exposed brain microvascular endothelial (bEnd.3) cells. On the other hand, the knockdown of cystatin C induced the opposite outcomes. These experimental results indicate a positive role for cystatin C in the regulation of caveolin-1 and occludin expression in cerebral ischemic injury. Taken together, these data unveil a new mechanism of the regulation of caveolin-1 expression by cystatin C in the maintenance of BBB  after ischemic brain injury and provide new clues for the identification of potential therapeutic strategies for stroke.© 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602443>Altered short chain fatty acid profiles induced by dietary fiber intervention regulate AMPK levels and intestinal homeostasis.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary intervention on intestinal microbiota-mediated change in short chain fatty acid (SCFA) profile and intestinal homeostasis. Sequencing of the 16S rDNA of gut bacteria, metagenomics, intestinal epithelial transcriptomics, and metabonomics were conducted. Results showed that the dietary interventions altered the microbiota composition of cecal digesta, microbiota-mediated metabolism, and the gene expression profile in intestinal epithelial cells. Compared with red meat-diet-fed mice, fiber-diet-fed mice presented a shift in the gut microbiome toward increased production of butanoate, which was accompanied by up-regulation of microbiota- and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent gene expression and decrease in serum concentrations of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), triglyceride (TG) and glucose (GLU). The results suggested a new regulatory mechanism via which butanoate and AMPK activation contributed to intestinal  and homeostasis by affecting metabolism, intestinal  function and transporter expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578425>Gram-negative synergy and mechanism of action of alkynyl bisbenzimidazoles.</a></h2><p>Bisbenzimidazoles with terminal alkynyl linkers, selective inhibitors of bacterial topoisomerase I, have been evaluated using bacterial cytological profiling (BCP) to ascertain their mechanism of action and screened for synergism to improve Gram-negative bacterial coverage. Principal component analysis of high throughput fluorescence images suggests a dual-mechanism of action affecting DNA synthesis and cell membrane . Fluorescence microscopy of bacteria challenged with two of the alkynyl-benzimidazoles revealed changes in the cellular ultrastructure that differed from topoisomerase II inhibitors including induction of spheroplasts and membrane lysis. The cytoskeleton recruitment enzyme inhibitor A22 in combination with one of the alkynyl-benzimidazoles was synergistic against Acinetobacter baumannii and Escherichia coli. Gram-positive coverage remained unchanged in the A22-alkynyl bisbenzimidazole combination. Efflux inhibitors were not synergistic, suggesting that the Gram-negative outer membrane was a significant  for alkynyl-bisbenzimidazole uptake. Time-kill assays demonstrated the A22-bisbenzimidazole combination had a similar growth inhibition curve to that of norfloxacin in E.coli. Bisbenzimidazoles with terminal alkynyl linkers likely impede bacterial growth by compromising cell membrane  and by interfering with DNA synthesis against Gram-positive pathogens and in the synergistic combination against Gram-negative pathogens including E. coli and multidrug-resistant A. baumanii.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664513>TRPM4-specific blocking antibody attenuates reperfusion injury in a rat model of stroke.</a></h2><p>Reperfusion therapy is currently the gold standard treatment for acute ischemic stroke. However, reperfusion injuries such as oedema and haemorrhagic transformation largely limit the use of this potent treatment to a narrow time window. Recently, transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) channel has emerged as a potential target for vascular protection in stroke management. Non-specificity and side effects are major concerns for current TRPM4 blockers. The present study was undertaken to develop a novel TRPM4 blocker for stroke management. We report the generation of a TRPM4-specific antibody M4P which binds to a region close to the channel pore. M4P could inhibit TRPM4 current and downregulate TRPM4 surface expression, therefore prevent hypoxia-induced cell swelling. In the rat model of 3-h stroke reperfusion, application of M4P at 2 h after occlusion ameliorated reperfusion injury by improving blood-brain  , and enhanced functional recovery. Our results demonstrate that TRPM4 blockade could attenuate reperfusion injury in stroke recanalization. When applied together with reperfusion treatments, TRPM4 blocking antibody has the potential to extend the therapeutic time window for acute ischemic stroke.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461996>Vitamin D Deficiency is Associated with Increased Disease Activity in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Vitamin D has an inhibitory role in the inflammatory signaling pathways and supports the  of the intestinal . Due to its immunomodulatory effect, vitamin D plays a role in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and a deficiency is associated with an increased risk for a flare. We aimed to investigate to what extent the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D3) level correlates with disease activity and whether a cut-off value can be defined that discriminates between active disease and remission.Patients with IBD, treated at the University Hospital Frankfurt were analyzed retrospectively. The 25(OH)D3 levels were correlated with clinical activity indices and laboratory chemical activity parameters. A deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D3 levels <30 ng/mL.A total of 470 (257 female) patients with IBD were included, 272 (57.9%) with Crohn's disease (CD), 198 (42.1%) with ulcerative colitis (UC). The median age of the patients was 41 (18-84). In 283 patients (60.2%), a vitamin D deficiency was detected. 245 (53.6%) patients received oral vitamin D supplementation, and supplemented patients had significantly higher vitamin D levels (p < 0.0001). Remission, vitamin D substitution, and male gender were independently associated with the 25(OH)D3 serum concentration in our cohort in regression analysis. A 25(OH)D3 serum concentration of 27.5 ng/mL was the optimal cut-off value.Vitamin D deficiency is common in IBD patients and appears to be associated with increased disease activity. In our study, vitamin D levels were inversely associated with disease activity. Thus, close monitoring should be established, and optimized supplementation should take place.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610866>Structural and signaling role of lipids in plasma membrane repair.</a></h2><p>The plasma membrane forms the physical  between the cytoplasm and extracellular space, allowing for biochemical reactions necessary for life to occur. Plasma membrane damage needs to be rapidly repaired to avoid cell death. This relies upon the coordinated action of the machinery that polarizes the repair response to the site of injury, resulting in resealing of the damaged membrane and subsequent remodeling to return the injured plasma membrane to its pre-injury state. As lipids comprise the bulk of the plasma membrane, the acts of injury, resealing, and remodeling all directly impinge upon the plasma membrane lipids. In addition to their structural role in shaping the physical properties of the plasma membrane, lipids also play an important signaling role in maintaining plasma membrane . While much attention has been paid to the involvement of proteins in the membrane repair pathway, the role of lipids in facilitating plasma membrane repair remains poorly studied. Here we will discuss the current knowledge of how lipids facilitate plasma membrane repair by regulating membrane structure and signaling to coordinate the repair response, and will briefly note how lipid involvement extends beyond plasma membrane repair to the tissue repair response.© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the expression of Arrb2 in microglial cells and its influence on HSE prognosis is still undefined. We explore the pathophysiological effect of Arrb2 in the brain using experimental HSE mice. The expression of Arrb2 in microglia was decreased significantly 48 hours following HSV-1 infection. Arrb2 overexpression transgenic (TG) mice had a significantly lower mortality and survival rate was improved by 40% compared to wild-type mice. Arrb2 suppressed the generation of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-4 expression. Arrb2 also inhibited the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB in microglial cells. Arrb2 TG mice attenuated the blood-brain  breakdown and relieved cerebral edema, meanwhile, Arrb2 improved mice neurological function compared with wild-type mice. Overall, Arrb2 favored microglia of the M2 phenotype, attenuated brain proinflammatory responses, protected the blood vessel wall , reduced HSV-1-induced neurological impairment, and improved the survival rate in HSE mice.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573885>Blood-brain  disruption may contribute to white matter lesions in the setting of internal jugular venous stenosis.</a></h2><p>Cloudy white matter lesions are associated imaging features of internal jugular venous stenosis（IJVS）.

Although there has been significant progress in understanding how apoE4 (apolipoprotein E4) drives amyloid pathology, its effects on amyloid-independent pathways, in particular cerebrovascular  and function, are less clear. Approach and Results: Here, we show that brain pericytes, the mural cells of the capillary walls, differentially modulate endothelial cell phenotype in an apoE isoform-dependent manner. Extracellular matrix protein induction, tube-like structure formation, and  formation were lower with endothelial cells cocultured with pericytes isolated from apoE4-targeted replacement mice compared with those from apoE3-TR mice.

Here we show hierarchial forms of a brain-specific phage-derived peptide (herein as NanoLigand Carriers, NLCs) target cerebral endothelial cells through transferrin receptor and the receptor for advanced glycation-end products, cross the blood-brain- and reach neurons and microglial cells. Through intravenous delivery of NLC-β-secretase 1 (BACE1) siRNA complexes we show effective BACE1 down-regulation in the brain without toxicity and inflammation.

However, whether methionine (Met) or a methionine hydroxyl analogue (2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid (HMB)) can alleviate deoxynivalenol (DON)-induced intestinal injury remains unknown. Mice were treated orally with Met or HMB on days 1-11 and with DON on days 4-8. On day 12, the mice were sacrificed, and the jejunum was collected for crypt isolation and culture. Mouse enteroids were treated with DON and Met or HMB ex vivo. The results showed that Met and HMB increased the average daily feed intake and average daily gain of the mice. Met and HMB also improved the jejunal structure and   and promoted ISC expansion, as indicated by the increased enteroid formation efficiency and area, under DON-induced injury conditions. In addition, DON-induced decreases in ISC activity were rescued Wnt/β-catenin signaling reactivation by Met or HMB in vivo and ex vivo. Collectively, our findings reveal that Met and HMB alleviated DON-induced intestinal injury by improving ISC expansion and reactivating Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Besides its effect in blood pressure reduction, ZGXFD is also known to be a radical therapy with little or no side effects. Compared with western medicines, Chinese medicinal formulas have the advantage of simultaneously attacking multiple targets. However, such a property brings trouble to the pharmacological studies of Chinese medicines. This study investigated the composition of gut microbiota in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) treated with ZGXFD. ZGXFD was shown to cause similar effects in the treatment group as benazepril: both were able to reduce in SHR the microbial diversity, Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio and coccus to bacillus (C/B) ratio. Meanwhile, ZGXFD can maintain the  of intestinal mechanistic  and elevate the percentage of bacteria producing short chain fatty acids (SCFA). By investigating renin-angiotensin system (RAS) system, we found that ZGXFD can decrease the expression of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) in lungs, which in turn causes a increase in AngI produces angiotensin1-7 (Ang1-7) and decrease in AngII.

Low doses of atorvastatin could significantly increase the vascular expressions of endothelial growth factor, and the number of peripheral blood endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), thus improving angiogenesis and local blood flow. G-CSF is an EPC-mobilization agent used in ischemia studies for targeting angiogenesis after cerebral ischemia via EPCs. In previous clinical trials, consistent conclusions have not been reached about the effectiveness of G-CSF on ischemic stroke. Therefore, the therapeutic effect of G-CSF and its combination with other medicines need further experimental verification. It is known that atorvastatin, rhG-CSF, and SDF-1 are considered the most promising neuroprotective candidates, but a comprehensive comparison of their effects is lacking.To compare the effects of atorvastatin, stromal cell-derived factor-1, and recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on ischemic stroke.Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to three groups: normal, sham-operated, and middle cerebral artery occlusion operated. Middle cerebral artery occlusion operated rats were further allocated into saline, atorvastatin, recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor + stromal cell-derived factor-1 groups. Neurological function evaluation, cerebral infarction and the blood-brain   analysis, identification of angiogenic factors, assessment of angiogenesis, expression of growth-associated protein-43, neuroglobin, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, and cleaved caspase 3, were performed.Compared with atorvastatin or recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor alone, recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor + stromal cell-derived factor-1 treatment improved neurological performance, reduced cerebral infarction and blood-brain  disruption after stroke, and increased the content of stromal cell-derived factor-1, vascular endothelial growth factor, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and basic fibroblast growth factor in peripheral blood. In addition, recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor + stromal cell-derived factor-1 promoted greater angiogenesis than atorvastatin or recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor alone and increased the expression of growth-associated protein-43, neuroglobin, and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, while decreasing the levels of cleaved caspase 3 in the brain after ischemic stroke.Combination therapy with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and stromal cell-derived factor-1 is more effective than atorvastatin or recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor alone in protecting against stroke-induced damage and could be an optimal therapeutic strategy for stroke.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541017>Perlecan regulates pericyte dynamics in the maintenance and repair of the blood-brain .</a></h2><p>Ischemic stroke causes blood-brain  (BBB) breakdown due to significant damage to the  of BBB components. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of pericytes in the repair process of BBB functions triggered by PDGFRβ up-regulation. Here, we show that perlecan, a major heparan sulfate proteoglycan of basement membranes, aids in BBB maintenance and repair through pericyte interactions. Using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model, we found larger infarct volumes and more BBB leakage in conditional perlecan ()-deficient (    TG) mice than in control mice. Control mice showed increased numbers of pericytes in the ischemic lesion, whereas     TG mice did not. At the mechanistic level, pericytes attached to recombinant perlecan C-terminal domain V (perlecan DV, endorepellin). Perlecan DV enhanced the PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of PDGFRβ, SHP-2, and FAK partially through integrin α5β1 and promoted pericyte migration. Perlecan therefore appears to regulate pericyte recruitment through the cooperative functioning of PDGFRβ and integrin α5β1 to support BBB maintenance and repair following ischemic stroke.This is a work of the U.S. Government and is not subject to copyright protection in the United States.

The kinase RIPK4 and the transcription factor IRF6 are mutated in severe developmental syndromes in humans, and mice lacking these genes display epidermal hyperproliferation and soft-tissue fusions that result in neonatal lethality. Our understanding of how these genes control epidermal differentiation is incomplete. Here we show that the role of RIPK4 in mouse development requires its kinase activity; that RIPK4 and IRF6 expressed in the epidermis regulate the same biological processes; and that the phosphorylation of IRF6 at Ser413 and Ser424 primes IRF6 for activation. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), histone chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) of skin in wild-type and IRF6-deficient mouse embryos, we define the transcriptional programs that are regulated by IRF6 during epidermal differentiation. IRF6 was enriched at bivalent promoters, and IRF6 deficiency caused defective expression of genes that are involved in the metabolism of lipids and the formation of tight junctions. Accordingly, the lipid composition of the stratum corneum of Irf6 skin was abnormal, culminating in a severe defect in the function of the epidermal .

When intestinal epithelial   is compromised, commensal bacteria are likely to translocate from the gut lumen into the lamina propria. Few studies have addressed the mechanisms by which commensal bacteria impact the function of gut Group 1 ILCs, especially ILC1s. Utilizing an  human colonic lamina propria mononuclear cell (LPMC) model, we evaluated Group 1 ILC cytokine and cytolytic protein production in response to a panel of enteric Gram-positive and Gram-negative commensal and pathogenic bacteria. IFNγ-production by NK cells and ILC1s was significantly increased after LPMC exposure to Gram-negative commensal or pathogenic bacteria, but not after exposure to the Gram-positive bacteria commensals tested. Stimulation of IFNγ production from Group 1 ILCs was not through direct recognition of bacteria by NK cells or ILC1s, but rather required accessory cells within the LPMC population. Myeloid dendritic cells generated IL-12p70, IL-18, and IL-1β upon exposure to enteric bacteria and these cytokines contributed to Group 1 ILC production of IFNγ. Furthermore, Gram-negative commensal or pathogenic bacteria induced significant expression of Granzyme B in NK cells and ILC1s. Overall, these data demonstrate that some enteric commensal bacteria indirectly induce inflammatory cytokine production and cytolytic protein expression from human colonic Group 1 ILCs, a process which could contribute to inflammation in the setting of microbial translocation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668993>MLCK and ROCK Mutualism in Endothelial  Dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Myosin activation contributes to the contractile forces that induce disturbances in the vascular endothelial  and promote protein-rich edema of the underlying tissues. Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) have been reported to phosphorylate myosin regulatory light chains (RLC) for myosin activation. However, the relative contribution and roles of these kinases are debatable and not understood in very detail. In this study, using a combinational inhibitory analysis of MLCK, ROCK, and their antagonist, myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP), we show that the MLCK-dependent RLC mono-(Ser19)phosphorylation (P-RLC) is sufficient to induce the FITC-dextran hyperpermeability in EA.hy926 endothelial cells (EC) in response to thrombin. However, MLCK relies on the ROCK assistance that attenuates MLCP activity. On the other hand, MLCK supplies P-RLC myosin as an intermediate substrate to ROCK thus adding to a faster accumulation of di-(Thr18/Ser19)phosphorylated RLC (PP-RLC) by the latter kinase. ROCK also produces P-RLC but is solely responsible for the thrombin-induced PP-RLC generation in EA.hy926 EC and other cell types. Still, as a direct myosin activator, ROCK contributes less to endothelial hyperpermeability than MLCK. Our findings are consistent with a concerted complementary mutual interplay between ROCK and MLCK to activate endothelial myosin and elicit the thrombin-mediated EC  dysfunction.Copyright © 2019.

While transient disruption of the BBB has been used to enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy in treating brain tumors, limitations in terms of magnitude and duration of BBB disruption exist. In the present study, the preliminary safety and efficacy profile of HAV6, a peptide that binds to the external domains of cadherin, to transiently open the BBB and improve the delivery of a therapeutic agent, was evaluated in a murine brain tumor model. Transient opening of the BBB in response to HAV6 peptide administration was quantitatively characterized using both a gadolinium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent and adenanthin (Ade), the intended therapeutic agent. The effects of HAV6 peptide on BBB  and the efficacy of concurrent administration of HAV6 peptide and the small molecule inhibitor, Ade, in the growth and progression of an orthotopic medulloblastoma mouse model using human D425 tumor cells was examined. Systemic administration of HAV6 peptide caused transient, reversible disruption of BBB in mice. Increases in BBB permeability produced by HAV6 were rapid in onset and observed in all regions of the brain examined. Concurrent administration of HAV6 peptide with Ade, a BBB impermeable inhibitor of Peroxiredoxin-1, caused reduced tumor growth and increased survival in mice bearing medulloblastoma. The rapid onset and transient nature of the BBB modulation produced with the HAV6 peptide along with its uniform disruption and biocompatibility is well-suited for CNS drug delivery applications, especially in the treatment of brain tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31517482>16α-Hydroxytrametenolic Acid from  Improves Intestinal  Function Through the Glucocorticoid Receptor-Mediated PI3K/Akt/NF-κB Pathway.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated the effect of triterpenoids from edible mushroom  on intestinal epithelium  and revealed the transcriptional regulatory pathways that underpin restorative mechanisms in the gut.

Here we investigate the mechanical strength of the three-component ClfA-Fg-αβ interaction on living bacteria, by means of single-molecule experiments. We find that the ClfA-Fg-αβ ternary complex is extremely stable, being able to sustain forces (∼800 pN) that are much stronger than those of classical bonds between integrins and the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptide sequence (∼100 pN). Adhesion forces between single bacteria and αβ are strongly inhibited by an anti-αβ antibody, the RGD peptide, and the cyclic RGD peptide cilengitide, showing that formation of the complex involves RGD-dependent binding sites and can be efficiently inhibited by αβ blockers. Collectively, our experiments favor a binding mechanism involving the extraordinary elasticity of Fg. In the absence of mechanical stress, RGD sequences in the Aα chains mediate weak binding to αβ, whereas under high mechanical stress exposure of cryptic Aα chain RGD sequences leads to extremely strong binding to the integrin. Our results identify an unexpected and previously undescribed force-dependent binding mechanism between ClfA and αβ on endothelial cells, which could represent a potential target to fight staphylococcal bloodstream infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636542>Investigations of the Microvasculature of the Human Macula Utricle in Meniere's Disease.</a></h2><p>The  and permeability of the blood labyrinthine  (BLB) in the inner ear is important to maintain adequate blood supply, and to control the passage of fluids, molecules and ions. Identifying the cellular and structural components of the BLB, the vascular endothelial cells (VECs), pericytes, and the perivascular basement membrane, is critical to understand the pathophysiology of the inner ear microvasculature and to design efficient delivery of therapeutics across the BLB. A recent study of the normal and pathological ultrastructural changes in the human macula utricle microvasculature demonstrated that the VECs are damaged in Meniere's disease (MD), and further studies identified oxidative stress markers (iNOS and nitrotyrosine) in the VECs. Using fluorescence microscopy, the microvasculature was studied in the macula utricle of patients diagnosed with MD that required transmastoid labyrinthectomy for intractable vertigo ( = 5), and patients who required a translabyrinthine approach for vestibular schwannoma (VS) resection ( = 3). Normal utricles (controls) were also included ( = 3). VECs were identified using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) and pericytes were identified using mouse monoclonal antibodies against alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Immunofluorescence (IF) staining was made in half of the utricle and flat mounted. The other half was used to study the  of the BLB using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). GLUT-1-IF, allowed delineation of the macula utricle microvasculature (located in the stroma underneath the sensory epithelia) in both MD and VS specimens. Three sizes of vessels were present in the utricle vasculature: Small size (<15 μm), medium size (15-25 μm) and large size >25 μm. α-SMA-IF was present in pericytes that surround the VECS in medium and thick size vessels. Thin size vessels showed almost no α-SMA-IF. AngioTool software was used for quantitative analysis. A significant decreased number of junctions, total vessel length, and average vessel length was detected in the microvasculature in MD specimens compared with VS and control specimens. The deeper understanding of the anatomy of the BLB in the human vestibular periphery and its pathological changes in disease will enable the development of non-invasive delivery strategy for the treatment of hearing and balance disorders.Copyright © 2019 Ishiyama, Lopez, Acuna and Ishiyama.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654502>Circular RNA USP1 regulates the permeability of blood-tumour  via miR-194-5p/FLI1 axis.</a></h2><p>Recent studies indicate circular RNAs are related to dysregulation of vascular endothelial cell function, yet the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. Here, we characterized the functional role of circular RNA USP1 (circ-USP1) in the regulation of the blood-tumour  (BTB) permeability and the potential mechanisms. In the current study, the circ-USP1 expressing level was up-regulated in glioma cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (GECs) of the BTB model in vitro. Knockdown of circ-USP1 disrupted the  , increased its permeability as well as reduced tight junction-related protein claudin-5, occludin and ZO-1 expressions in GECs. Bioinformatic prediction and luciferase assay indicated that circ-USP1 bound to miR-194-5p and suppressed its activity. MiR-194-5p contributed to circ-USP1 knockdown-induced increase of BTB permeability via targeting and down-regulating transcription factor FLI1. Furthermore, FLI1 regulated the expressions of claudin-5, occludin and ZO-1 in GECs through binding to their promoter regions. Single or combined treatment of circ-USP1 and miR-194-5p effectively promoted anti-tumour drug doxorubicin across BTB to induce apoptosis of glioma cells. Overall, this present study identified the crucial regulation of circ-USP1 on BTB permeability via miR-194-5p/FLI1 axis-mediated regulation of tight junction proteins, which might facilitate the development of therapeutics against human gliomas.© 2019 The Authors.

Brain edema is a significant factor for increased intracranial pressure (ICP), which ultimately causes functional disability and death. The decompressive craniotomy (DC) is a surgical procedure widely used for treating increased ICP following TBI. The life-saving craniotomy itself results in brain injury. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of agomelatine against craniotomy induced brain injury. The craniotomy was performed by a variable speed micro-motor dental driller of 0.8 mm drill bit. The present study, in addition to blood-brain permeability, brain water content (edema) and histological examination of the brain, also estimated locomotor activity, oxidant, and antioxidant parameters. Results show that the craniotomy induced increase in the blood-brain  permeability, brain water content (edema), oxidative stress (lipid peroxide and nitric oxide) and impaired antioxidant mechanisms (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and reduced glutathione) in rats. The craniotomy was also found to increase neuronal cell death indicated by augmented chromatolysis and impaired locomotor activity. Administration of agomelatine after the craniotomy ameliorated histopathological, neurochemical and behavioral consequences of craniotomy. Thus agomelatine is effective against brain injury caused by craniotomy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31506767>Metabolically and immunologically beneficial impact of extra virgin olive and flaxseed oils on composition of gut microbiota in mice.</a></h2><p>Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and flaxseed oil (FO) contain a variety of constituents beneficial for chronic inflammation and cardio-metabolic derangement. However, little is known about the impact of EVOO and FO on dysbiosis of gut microbiota, intestinal immunity, and . We, therefore, aimed to assess the impact of EVOO and FO on gut microbiota, mucosal immunity,  , and metabolic health in mice.C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to a low-fat (LF), lard (HF), high fat-extra virgin olive oil (HF-EVOO), or high fat-flaxseed oil (HF-FO) diet for 10 weeks. Gut microbiota assessment was undertaken using 16S rRNA sequencing. Levels of mRNA for genes involved in intestinal inflammation and  maintenance in the intestine and bacterial infiltration in the liver were measured by qPCR.HF-EVOO or HF-FO mice showed greater diversity in gut microbiota as well as a lower abundance of the Firmicutes phylum in comparison with HF mice (P < 0.05). The qPCR analyses revealed that mRNA level of FoxP3, a transcription factor, and IL-10, an inducer of regulatory T cells, was significantly elevated in the intestines of mice-fed HF-EVOO in comparison with mice-fed HF (P < 0.05). The mRNA level of the antimicrobial peptide, RegӀӀӀγ, was markedly elevated in the intestines of HF-EVOO and HF-FO compared with HF group (P < 0.05).Our data suggest that the consumption of EVOO or FO can beneficially impact gut microbiota, enhance gut immunity, and assist in the preservation of metabolic health in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601922>NSAIDs disrupt intestinal homeostasis by suppressing macroautophagy in intestinal epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Small intestinal damage induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) remains an under-recognized clinical disorder. The incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology has hampered the development of prevention and treatment strategies leading to the high morbidity and mortality rates. NSAIDs are known to modulate macroautophagy, a process indispensable for intestinal homeostasis. Whether NSAIDs stimulate or repress macroautophagy and how this correlates with the clinical manifestations of NSAID enteropathy, however, remains unknown. The objectives of this study were to determine whether NSAIDs impaired macroautophagy and how this affects macroautophagy-regulated intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) processes essential for intestinal homeostasis (i.e., clearance of invading pathogens, secretion and composition of mucus building blocks, and inflammatory response). We show that NSAID treatment of IECs inhibits macroautophagy in vitro and in vivo. This inhibition was likely attributed to a reduction in the area and/or distribution of lysosomes available for degradation of macroautophagy-targeted cargo. Importantly, IEC regulatory processes necessary for intestinal homeostasis and dependent on macroautophagy were dysfunctional in the presence of NSAIDs. Since macroautophagy is essential for gastrointestinal health, NSAID-induced inhibition of macroautophagy might contribute to the severity of intestinal injury by compromising the  of the mucosal , preventing the clearance of invading microbes, and exacerbating the inflammatory response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635305>AMPK Activation Promotes Tight Junction Assembly in Intestinal Epithelial Caco-2 Cells.</a></h2><p>The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is principally known as a major regulator of cellular energy status, but it has been recently shown to play a key structural role in cell-cell junctions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of AMPK activation on the reassembly of tight junctions in intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells. We generated Caco-2 cells invalidated for AMPK α1/α2 (AMPK dKO) by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and evaluated the effect of the direct AMPK activator 991 on the reassembly of tight junctions following a calcium switch assay. We analyzed the  of the epithelial  by measuring the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), the paracellular permeability, and quantification of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) deposit at plasma membrane by immunofluorescence. Here, we demonstrated that AMPK deletion induced a delay in tight junction reassembly and relocalization at the plasma membrane during calcium switch, leading to impairments in the establishment of TEER and paracellular permeability. We also showed that 991-induced AMPK activation accelerated the reassembly and reorganization of tight junctions, improved the development of TEER and paracellular permeability after calcium switch. Thus, our results show that AMPK activation ensures a better recovery of epithelial  function following injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31475000>How the Interplay Between the Commensal Microbiota, Gut  , and Mucosal Immunity Regulates Brain Autoimmunity.</a></h2><p>The intestinal  provides the host with a strong defense line against the external environment playing also a pivotal role in the crosstalk between the gut microbiota and the immune system. Notably, increasing lines of evidence concerning autoimmune disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS) report an imbalance in both intestinal microbiota composition and mucosal immunity activation, along with an alteration of gut  permeability, suggesting this complex network plays a crucial role in modulating the course of autoimmune responses occurring in tissues outside the gut such as the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we review current knowledge on how gut inflammation and breakage of gut   modulates the interplay between the commensal gut microbiota and the immune system and its role in shaping brain immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511021>Claudin-12 is not required for blood-brain  tight junction function.</a></h2><p>The blood-brain  (BBB) ensures central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis by strictly controlling the passage of molecules and solutes from the bloodstream into the CNS. Complex and continuous tight junctions (TJs) between brain endothelial cells block uncontrolled paracellular diffusion of molecules across the BBB, with claudin-5 being its dominant TJs protein. However, claudin-5 deficient mice still display ultrastructurally normal TJs, suggesting the contribution of other claudins or tight-junction associated proteins in establishing BBB junctional complexes. Expression of claudin-12 at the BBB has been reported, however the exact function and subcellular localization of this atypical claudin remains unknown.We created claudin-12-lacZ-knock-in C57BL/6J mice to explore expression of claudin-12 and its role in establishing BBB TJs function during health and neuroinflammation. We furthermore performed a broad standardized phenotypic check-up of the mouse mutant.Making use of the lacZ reporter allele, we found claudin-12 to be broadly expressed in numerous organs. In the CNS, expression of claudin-12 was detected in many cell types with very low expression in brain endothelium. Claudin-12 C57BL/6J mice lacking claudin-12 expression displayed an intact BBB and did not show any signs of BBB dysfunction or aggravated neuroinflammation in an animal model for multiple sclerosis. Determining the precise localization of claudin-12 at the BBB was prohibited by the fact that available anti-claudin-12 antibodies showed comparable detection and staining patterns in tissues from wild-type and claudin-12 C57BL/6J mice.Our present study thus shows that claudin-12 is not essential in establishing or maintaining BBB TJs . Claudin-12 is rather expressed in cells that typically lack TJs suggesting that claudin-12 plays a role other than forming classical TJs. At the same time, in depth phenotypic screening of clinically relevant organ functions of claudin-12 C57BL/6J mice suggested the involvement of claudin-12 in some neurological but, more prominently, in cardiovascular functions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31558347>Gaps and barriers: Gap junctions as a channel of communication between the soma and the germline.</a></h2><p>Gap junctions, expressed in most tissues of the body, allow for the cytoplasmic coupling of adjacent cells and promote tissue cooperation.

In this review, we examine the involvement of gap junctions in the relay of information between the soma and the germline, and ask whether such communication could have consequences for the progeny. While the influence of parental experiences on descendants is of great interest, the possibility that gap junctions participate in the transmission of information across generations is largely unexplored.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Male Wistar rats ( = 50; 250-300 g) were randomly allocated into two experimental groups: RIC/Control. Thirty minutes of THI was induced by clamping the hepatoduodenal ligament. iRIC was applied as 4-min of ischemia followed by 11-min of reperfusion by clamping the superior mesenteric artery. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 2, 6, 24 h post-reperfusion ( = 5/group/timepoint). RIC of the gut significantly improved microcirculation of the ileum and the liver. Tissue ATP-levels were higher following iRIC (Liver: 1.34 ± 0.12 vs. 0.97 ± 0.20 μmol/g,  = 0.04) and hepatocellular injury was reduced significantly (ALT: 2409 ± 447 vs. 6613 ± 1117 IU/L,  = 0.003). Systemic- and portal venous IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels were markedly lower following iRIC, demonstrating a reduced inflammatory response. iRIC led to a structural and functional preservation of the intestinal . These results suggest that iRIC might confer a potent protection against the detrimental effects of THI in rats via reducing IRI and systemic inflammatory responses and at the same time by mitigating the dramatic consequences of severe intestinal congestion and bacterial translocation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31478134>Anfibatide Preserves Blood-Brain   by Inhibiting TLR4/RhoA/ROCK Pathway After Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Rat.</a></h2><p>The disruption of the blood-brain  (BBB) and the consequent brain edema are major contributors to the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. RhoA is generally thought to play a crucial role in the process of BBB disruption and participate in the signaling pathways emanating from TLR4. However, it remains unverified the regulatory role of TLR4 in the RhoA/ROCK pathway in cerebral I/R injury and its effects on the BBB as well. The present study probes into the protective effect of ANF on the BBB after cerebral I/R injury and the possible mechanisms. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by 120 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). ANF (1, 2, 4 μg/kg) was achieved by intravenous injection after 120 min of MCAO followed by 1, 24, 48, and 72 h reperfusion. Evans blue extravasation, brain water content, RhoA activity, and the expressions of TLR4, ROCK1/2, p-MLC2, MMP-2/9, ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 protein in rat brain were evaluated 72 h after reperfusion. ANF could significantly reduce the Evans blue extravasation and water content in the ipsilateral hemisphere and obviously increase the occludin, claudin-5, and ZO-1 expression after cerebral I/R injury. Furthermore, cerebral I/R injury induced apparently increased expression of TLR4, RhoA-GTP, ROCK1/2, p-MLC2, and MMMP-2/9, which, however, could be remarkably alleviated by ANF intervention. Taken together, the TLR4/RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway is implicated in BBB breakdown after cerebral I/R injury, and ANF preserves BBB , probably via inhibiting the TLR4/RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671369>Activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor by dioxin directly shifts gut microbiota in zebrafish.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota is of critical importance to host health. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is found to be closely involved in the regulation of gut microbial dynamics. However, it is still not clear how AhR signaling shapes the gut microbiota. In the present study, adult zebrafish were acutely exposed to an AhR antagonist (CH223191), an AhR agonist (polychlorinated biphenyl 126; PCB126) or their combination for 7 d. Overall intestinal health and gut microbial community were temporally monitored (1 d, 3 d and 7 d) and inter-compared among different groups. The results showed that single exposure to PCB126 significantly disrupted the overall health of intestines (i.e., neural signaling, inflammation, epithelial  , oxidative stress). However, CH223191 failed to inhibit but enhanced the physiological toxicities of PCB126, implying the involvement of extra mechanisms rather than AhR in the regulation of intestinal physiological activities. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota was also caused by PCB126 over time as a function of sex. It is intriguing that CH223191 successfully abolished the holistic effects of dioxin on gut microbiota, which inferred that growth of gut microbes was directly controlled by AhR activation without the involvement of host feedback modulation. When coming to detailed alterations at certain taxon, both antagonistic and synergistic interactions existed between CH223191 and dioxin, depending on fish sex, exposure duration and bacterial species. Correlation analysis found that gut inflammation was positively associated with pathogenic Legionella bacteria, but was negatively associated with epithelial  , suggesting that integral intestinal epithelial  can prevent the influx of pathogenic bacteria to induce inflammatory response. Overall, this study has deciphered, for the first time, the direct regulative effects of AhR activity on gut microbiota. Future research is warranted to elucidate the specific mechanisms of AhR action on certain bacterial population.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

CRYAB expression was assessed in cultured HT29 and Caco-2 cells and inflamed mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colitis models in mice. Lentivirus-overexpressing and CRSIPR/Cas9 systems were used in different cells to upregulate and silence CRYAB expression, respectively. Cell permeable recombined fusion protein TAT-CRYAB was injected intraperitoneally into dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice to assess its anti-inflammatory effects. CRYAB was found to be significantly decreased in the inflamed mucosa from IBD patients and DSS-induced colitis in mice, and negatively correlated with the levels of TNF-α and IL-6, respectively. Enforced expression of CRYAB suppressed expression of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8) via inhibiting the IKK complex formation, whereas lack of CRYAB expression markedly enhanced proinflammatory responses. Consistently, administration of TAT-CRYAB fusion protein significantly alleviated DSS- or TNBS-induced colitis in mice and protected intestinal  . CRYAB regulates inflammatory response in intestinal mucosa by inhibiting IKKβ-mediated signaling and may serve as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504799>MEK/MELK inhibition and blood-brain -deficiencies in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors.</a></h2><p>Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) are rare, but highly aggressive. These entities are of embryonal origin occurring in the central nervous system (CNS) of young children. Molecularly these tumors are driven by a single hallmark mutation, resulting in inactivation of SMARCB1 or SMARCA4. Additionally, activation of the MAPK signaling axis and preclinical antitumor efficacy of its inhibition have been described in AT/RT.We established and validated a patient-derived neurosphere culture and xenograft model of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) subtype AT/RT, at diagnosis and relapse from the same patient. We set out to study the vascular phenotype of these tumors to evaluate the  of the blood-brain  (BBB) in AT/RT. We also used the model to study combined MEK and MELK inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for AT/RT.We found MELK to be highly overexpressed in both patient samples of AT/RT and in our primary cultures and xenografts. We identified a potent antitumor efficacy of the MELK inhibitor OTSSP167, as well as strong synergy with the MEK inhibitor trametinib, against primary AT/RT neurospheres. Additionally, vascular phenotyping of AT/RT patient material and xenografts revealed significant BBB aberrancies in these tumors. Finally, we show in vivo efficacy of the non-BBB penetrable drugs OTSSP167 and trametinib in AT/RT xenografts, demonstrating the therapeutic implications of the observed BBB deficiencies and validating MEK/MELK inhibition as a potential treatment.Altogether, we developed a combination treatment strategy for AT/RT based on MEK/MELK inhibition and identify therapeutically exploitable BBB deficiencies in these tumors.© The Author(s) 2019.

Epithelial cells lining the FGT provide the first  to HIV-1 entry. Previous studies have suggested that certain hormonal contraceptives or a dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiota can enhance HIV-1 acquisition in the FGT. We examined the effects of lactobacilli and female sex hormones on the  functions and innate immune responses of primary endometrial genital epithelial cells (GECs). Two probiotic strains,  RC-14 and  GR-1, were tested, as were sex hormones estrogen (E2), progesterone (P4), and the hormonal contraceptive medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Our results demonstrate that probiotic lactobacilli enhance  function without affecting cytokines. Treatment of GECs with MPA resulted in reduced  function. In contrast, E2 treatment enhanced  function and reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines. Comparison of hormones plus lactobacilli as a pre-treatment prior to HIV exposure revealed a dominant effect of lactobacilli in preventing loss of  function by GECs. In summary, the combination of E2 and lactobacilli had the best protective effect against HIV-1 seen by enhancement of  function and reduction in proinflammatory cytokines. These studies provide insights into how probiotic lactobacilli in the female genital microenvironment can alter HIV-1-mediated  disruption and how the combination of E2 and lactobacilli may decrease susceptibility to primary HIV infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616319>Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress in Rats Induces Colonic Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Chronic psychological stress is associated with an increased risk for relapse of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and impedes the treatment of this condition. However, the impact of stress on the risk of IBD onset remains unclear. The goal of the present study was to examine whether chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) could initiate or aggravate the onset of colon inflammation in rats which, in turn, would be capable of triggering bowel disease. We found that CUMS exposure increased infiltration of CD-45 positive cells and MPO activity, as well as augmented the expression of the inflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ and IL-6 within the colon of these rats. In addition, CUMS treatment changed the composition and diversity of gut microbiota and enhanced intestinal epithelial permeability, indicating the presence of a defect in the intestinal . This CUMS-induced disruption of mucosal   was associated with a reduction in expression of the tight junction protein, occludin 1, and an inhibition in mucosal layer functioning via reductions in goblet cells. Results from bacterial cultures revealed an increased presence of bacterial invasion after CUMS treatment as compared with that observed in controls. Thus, our data indicate that CUMS treatment induces alterations of the fecal microbiome and intestinal  defects, which facilitates bacterial invasion into colonic mucosa and further exacerbates inflammatory reactions within the colon. Accordingly, chronic stress may predispose patients to gastrointestinal infection and increase the risk of inflammation-related gut diseases.Copyright © 2019 Wei, Li, Tang, Sun, Chen, Wang, Liu, Yu, Yu, Liu and Ma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560236>Ultrastructure of intestinal mucosa in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.</a></h2><p>Impaired intestinal  function has been demonstrated in the pathophysiology of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). This study aimed to describe the intestinal ultrastructural findings in the intestinal mucosal layer of IBS-D patients.In total, 10 healthy controls and 10 IBS-D patients were analyzed in this study. The mucosa of each patient's rectosigmoid colon was first assessed by confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE); next, biopsied specimens of these sites were obtained. Intestinal tissues of IBS-D patients and healthy volunteers were examined to observe cellular changes by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).CLE showed no visible epithelial damage or inflammatory changes in the colonic mucosa of IBS-D compared with healthy volunteers. On transmission electron microscopic examination, patients with IBS-D displayed a larger apical intercellular distance with a higher proportion of dilated (>20 nm) intercellular junctional complexes, which was indicative of impaired mucosal . In addition, microvillus exfoliation, extracellular vesicle as well as increased presence of multivesicular bodies were visible in IBS-D patients. Single epithelial cells appeared necrotic, as characterized by cytoplasmic vacuolization, cytoplasmic swelling, and presence of autolysosome. A significant association between bowel habit, frequency of abdominal pain, and enlarged intercellular distance was found.This study showed ultrastructural alterations in the architecture of intestinal epithelial cells and intercellular junctional complexes in IBS-D patients, potentially representing a pathophysiological mechanism in IBS-D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632292>YangXue QingNao Wan, a Compound Chinese Medicine, Attenuates Cerebrovascular Hyperpermeability and Neuron Injury in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat: Effect and Mechanism.</a></h2><p>The purpose of the study was to explore the effect of YangXue QingNao Wan (YXQNW), a compound Chinese medicine, on cerebrovascular hyperpermeability, neuronal injury, and related mechanisms in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR).Fourteen-week-old male SHR were used, with Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats as control. YXQNW (0.5 g/kg/day), enalapril (EN, 8 mg/kg/day), and nifedipine (NF, 7.1 mg/kg/day) were administrated orally for 4 weeks. To assess the effects of the YXQNW on blood pressure, the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean blood pressure (MBP) were measured. After administering the drugs for 4 weeks, the cerebral blood flow (CBF), albumin leakage from microvessels in middle cerebral artery (MCA)-dominated area, and the number and morphology of microvessels were assessed in the hippocampus area and cortex. Neuronal damage and apoptosis were assessed by Nissl staining and TUNEL staining. To assess the mechanisms of cerebrovascular hyperpermeability, we performed immunofluorescence and Western blot to assess the expression and  of cerebral microvascular tight junction (TJ) and caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in cortex. Energy metabolism and Src-MLC-MLCK pathway in cortex were assessed then for elucidating the underlying mechanism of the observed effect of YXQNW.Spontaneously hypertensive rat exhibited higher blood pressure, Evans blue (EB) extravasation, albumin leakage, increased brain water content, decreased CBF, perivascular edema, and neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus and cortex, all of which were attenuated by YXQNW treatment. YXQNW inhibited the downregulation of TJ proteins, mitochondrial Complex I, Complex II, and Complex V, and upregulation of caveolin-1, inhibiting Src/MLCK/MLC signaling in SHR. YXQNW combined with EN + NF revealed a better effect for some outcomes compared with either YXQNW or EN + NF alone.The overall result shows the potential of YXQNW to attenuate blood-brain  (BBB) breakdown in SHR, which involves regulation of energy metabolism and Src/MLCK/MLC signaling.

Treatment options for reducing the risk of all subtypes of stroke in patients with CKD remain limited. For patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), novel applications of noninvasive imaging may help personalize the type of dialysis and dialysis prescription for patients at high-risk.This manuscript reviews the heightened risk of stroke in patients with nephropathy, including ischemic and hemorrhagic subtypes. Mechanisms associated with increased risk include alterations in cardiac output, platelet function, regional cerebral perfusion, accelerated systemic atherosclerosis, altered blood brain , and disordered neurovascular coupling. There is great potential for noninvasive monitoring of the cerebral vasculature using transcranial Doppler (TCD) to reduce stroke risk, particularly in patients with ESKD. Key Messages: Compared to the general population, patients with CKD are at heightened risk for all subtypes of stroke. This is due to a multitude of mechanisms linking nephropathy with altered cerebral perfusion, cerebral neurovascular coupling, and blood vessel . Intracranial imaging is not currently standard of care practice in patients with CKD or ESKD. TCD may provide clinicians real-time and noninvasive measurement of brain perfusion. This could be useful for assessing risk of stroke in patients' initiating dialysis, individualizing dialysis prescriptions, and potentially reducing rates of cerebrovascular disease and stroke in high-risk patients.© 2019 S.

During ITER operation, in case of a loss-of-vacuum-accident, tungsten nanoparticles (W-NPs) could potentially be released into the environment and induce occupational exposure via inhalation. W-NPs toxicity was evaluated on MucilAir™, a 3D in vitro cell model of the human airway epithelium. MucilAir™ was exposed for 24 h to metallic ITER-like milled W-NPs, tungstate (WO) and tungsten carbide cobalt particles alloy (WC-Co). Cytotoxicity and its reversibility were assessed using a kinetic mode up to 28 days after exposure. Epithelial tightness, metabolic activity and interleukin-8 release were also evaluated. Electron microscopy was performed to determine any morphological modification, while mass spectrometry allowed the quantification of W-NPs internalization and of W transfer through the MucilAir™. Our results underlined a decrease in  , no effect on metabolic activity or cell viability and a transient increase in IL-8 secretion after exposure to ITER-like milled W-NPs. These effects were associated with W-transfer through the epithelium, but not with intracellular accumulation. We have shown that, under our experimental conditions, ITER-like milled W-NPs have a minor impact on the MucilAir™ in vitro model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545471>High‑fat treatment prevents postoperative cognitive dysfunction in a hyperlipidemia model by protecting the blood‑brain  via Mfsd2a‑related signaling.</a></h2><p>Damage to the blood‑brain  (BBB) resulting from systemic inflammation caused by surgical trauma is associated with cognitive dysfunction, and individuals with hyperlipidemia are more sensitive to such impairment. The present study was designed to ascertain whether dexmedetomidine (Dex) treatment could reduce the incidence of cognitive dysfunction following surgery in a hyperlipidemia model. Hyperlipidemia was induced in Sprague‑Dawley rats (male, 6‑7 months old) by consuming a high‑fat diet, and rats were divided into three groups (n=10 each) and underwent: exploratory laparotomy to introduce surgical trauma (surgery group), laparotomy and Dex treatment (surgery+Dex group), or sham surgery (sham group). Learning, memory and exploration behavior were assessed using the Morris water maze. Concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α and interleukin (IL)‑1β, were determined by enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay. BBB permeability was assessed by Evans blue staining. Relative major facilitator superfamily domain‑containing protein 2 (Mfsd2a) mRNA expression was determined by quantitative PCR. In the Morris water maze test, the time and distance ratio for the surgery group was significantly lower than those of the sham and surgery+Dex groups (P<0.05). In addition, the TNF‑α concentrations in the sham and surgery+Dex groups were lower than that in the surgery group (P<0.05 on days 1 and 3). Evans Blue staining was increased in the surgery group on day 1 (P<0.01). Mfsd2a mRNA expression was higher in the sham and surgery+Dex groups compared with that noted in the surgery group (P<0.05). In conclusion, Dex treatment decreased the incidence of cognitive dysfunction following surgical trauma in a hyperlipidemia rat model. We demonstrated that Dex stabilized BBB  through increased Mfsd2a gene expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569428>Advanced Organ-on-a-Chip Devices to Investigate Liver Multi-Organ Communication: Focus on Gut, Microbiota and Brain.</a></h2><p>The liver is a key organ that can communicate with many other districts of the human body. In the last few decades, much interest has focused on the interaction between the liver and the gut microbiota, with their reciprocal influence on biosynthesis pathways and the  the intestinal epithelial . Dysbiosis or liver disorders lead to0 epithelial  dysfunction, altering membrane permeability to toxins. Clinical and experimental evidence shows that the permeability hence the delivery of neurotoxins such as LPS, ammonia and salsolinol contribute to neurological disorders. These findings suggested multi-organ communication between the gut microbiota, the liver and the brain.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying cerebral microvascular dysfunction in these conditions are largely unknown. The molecular characterization of cerebral microvessels in experimental disease models has been hindered by the lack of a standardized method to reproducibly isolate intact cerebral microvessels with consistent cellular compositions and without the use of enzymatic digestion, which causes undesirable molecular and metabolic changes. Herein, we describe an optimized protocol for microvessel isolation from mouse brain cortex that yields microvessel fragments with consistent populations of discrete blood-brain  (BBB) components (endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocyte end feet) while retaining high RNA integrity and protein post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation). We demonstrate that this protocol allows the quantification of changes in gene expression in a disease model (stroke) and the activation of signaling pathways in mice subjected to drug administration in vivo. We also describe the isolation of genomic DNA (gDNA) and bisulfite treatment for the assessment of DNA methylation, as well as the optimization of chromatin extraction and shearing from cortical microvessels. This optimized protocol and the described applications should improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing cerebral microvascular dysfunction, which may help in the development of novel therapies for stroke and other neurologic conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505255>CXCR7: A key neuroprotective molecule against alarmin HMGB1 mediated CNS pathophysiology and subsequent memory impairment.</a></h2><p>High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an endogenous alarmin that drives the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders including cognitive decline. Therefore, HMGB1 is thought to be a common biomarker as well as promising therapeutic target for neuroinflammation associated with neurocognitive disorders. Here, for the first time, we have unmasked the potential inhibitory effect of a novel receptor of HMGB1-CXCL12 complex; atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3/CXCR7) on HMGB1 induced glial phenotype switching, neuroinflammation, and subsequent memory loss. Upregulation of CXCR7 inhibits HMGB1-CXCL12 complex induced peripheral immune cells infiltration to CNS by regulating blood-brain  (BBB)  in HMGB1 induced dementia model of mice. Whereas, gene knockdown study by RNA interference (non-invasive intranasal delivery to animal model) shows CXCR7 ablation aggravates inflammatory responses in hippocampus region and immune cell infiltration to CNS tissue by breached BBB. This study also indicates the important role of CXCR7 molecule in maintaining CNS homeostasis by balancing M1/M2 microglia, A1/A2 astrocytes, long term potentiation/long term depression markers which ultimately ameliorates HMGB1 induced neurodegeneration, synaptic depression and memory loss (assessed by both radial arm maze and Morris water maze) in male mice model of dementia. Overall, the study summarizes several significant protective functions afforded by CXCR7 against HMGB1 induced disbalance in neuroimmunological axis, neurodegeneration and memory loss and thereby provides a new paradigm for strategic development of novel therapeutics against neurodegenerative diseases with dementia as a common symptom.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast to the well-characterized role of TJs in maintaining cerebrovascular , the specific function of endothelial podosomes remains unknown. Intriguingly, we discovered cross-talk between podosomes and TJs in human brain endothelial cells. Tight junction scaffold proteins ZO-1 and ZO-2 localize at podosomes in response to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate treatment. We found that both ZO proteins are essential for podosome formation and function. Rather than being derived from new protein synthesis, podosomal ZO-1 and ZO-2 are relocated from a pre-existing pool found at the peripheral plasma membrane with enhanced physical interaction with cortactin, a known protein marker for podosomes. Sequestration of ZO proteins in podosomes weakens tight junction complex formation, leading to increased endothelial cell permeability. This effect can be further attenuated by podosome inhibitor PP2. Altogether, our data revealed a novel cellular function of podosomes, specifically, their ability to negatively regulate tight junction and endothelial  , which have been linked to a variety of cerebrovascular diseases.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574297>Plant protein diet suppressed immune function by inhibiting spiral valve intestinal mucosal  , anti-oxidation, apoptosis, autophagy and proliferation responses in amur sturgeon (Acipenser schrenckii).</a></h2><p>An 8-week growth trial was conducted to investigate the effects of replacing dietary fishmeal with a plant protein blend on the growth performance, mucosal   and the related regulation mechanism in Amur Sturgeon (Acipenser schrenckii) with initial weight of 87.48 g. Three isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets were prepared. A basal diet containing 540 g/kg fishmeal (P0), whereas the other two diets were formulated by replacing 50% and 100% of FM with plant protein blend (soybean protein concentrate and cottonseed protein concentrate), and named as P50 and P100, respectively. Although essential amino acids, fatty acids, and available phosphorus had been balanced according to the nutrient requirement of sturgeon, compared with the fish of P0 and P50, the full plant protein diet (P100) significantly reduced growth performance and survival, and accompanied with serious spiral valve intestinal (SVI) damage. The increased tissue necrosis and failed responses in anti-oxidation, programming apoptosis, autophagy and cell proliferation system were regulated by inhibiting ERK1 phosphorylation, which indicated that SVI hypoimmunity and functional degradation were the main reasons for the high mortality and low utilization ability of plant protein in Amur sturgeon.Copyright © 2019.

The VDR is activated by 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and plays an important role in maintaining  of the intestinal mucosal . LCA can also substitute for vitamin D to carry out the in vivo functions of vitamin D. However, it is unclear whether activation of the VDR by LCA affects mucosal  function. In the present study, we researched the protective effect of LCA on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced intestinal epithelial  dysfunction in Caco-2 cells of the human epithelial intestinal adenocarcinoma cell line. Caco-2 cell monolayers were pretreated with LCA and then exposed to 100 ng/mL TNF-α. The results showed that LCA alleviated the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in FITC-Dextran flux induced by TNF-α. LCA ameliorated the TNF-α-induced decrease in protein expression and distribution of ZO-1, E-cadherin, Occludin, and Claudin-1, which are tight junction markers. Additionally, the LCA treatment effectively counteracted TNF-α-mediated downregulation of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1, which are related to oxidative stress. Increases in NF-κB p-p65 and p-IκB-α induced by TNF-α were significantly inhibited by LCA. Considering all these, the present study indicates that LCA has a significant protective effect on TNF-α-induced injury of intestinal  function through the VDR and suggests that suppressing NF-κB signaling and activating the SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway might be one of the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of LCA.Copyright © 2019.

Lipoxins are endogenous lipids involving in the resolution of inflammation. It is found that lipoxin A4 (LXA4) has the distinct properties to improve the anti-edema and pro-resolution function in inflammation. Since aquaporins (AQPs) have essential roles in the  of  function during fluid transport, especially AQP5 in the maintaining of the epithelium permeability, the current study is aimed to evaluate the potential role of LXA4 in regulating alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) during fluid transport and the corresponding change of AQP5 in the lung.ALI was induced by the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneal injection, and LXA4 treatment was given 8 hours after LPS administration. We investigated changes in the capacity of AFC, pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the severity of ALI. Then AQP5 expression in lung tissue and potential regulatory pathways in LPS-induced ALI was explored.LXA4 treatment was found to inhibit AFC capacity, inflammatory cytokine release, partially, alleviate ALI severity, and restored AQP5 expression partially. Additionally, we found that LXA4 played a protective role by the inhibition of the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK.In summary, our results suggest that LXA4 plays a protective role in lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI by restoring AFC capacity and upregulating AQP5 expression and inhibiting the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK. These findings suggest potential new mechanism of LXA4 as anti-inflammation therapy for the impairment of alveolar fluid transport in ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31529796>Assembly and Application of a Three-Dimensional Human Corneal Tissue Model.</a></h2><p>The cornea provides a functional  separating the outside environment from the intraocular environment, thereby protecting posterior segments of the eye from infection and damage.

We investigated BFR effects, known as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) (47, 99 and 209) in an air-liquid-interface (ALI) airway tissue derived from A549 cell line, and compared with ALI culture of primary human bronchial epithelial cells (pHBEC). The cells, exposed to PBDEs (47, 99 and 209) (0.01-1 μM) for 24 h, were studied for IL-8, Muc5AC and Muc5B (mRNAs and proteins) production, as well as NOX-4 (mRNA) expression. Furthermore, we evaluated tight junction (TJ)  by Trans-Epithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) measurements, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression in the cells, and pH variations and rheological properties (elastic G', and viscous G″, moduli) in apical washes of ALI cultures. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (10 mM) effects were tested in our experimental model of A549 cells.

Here, we addressed whether flow and peristalsis impact the infectivity of the human pathogen Shigella within a 3D colonic epithelium using Intestine-Chip technology. Strikingly, infection is significantly increased and minimal bacterial loads are sufficient to invade enterocytes from the apical side and trigger loss of  , thereby shifting the paradigm about early stage Shigella invasion. Shigella quickly colonizes epithelial crypt-like invaginations and demonstrates the essential role of the microenvironment. Furthermore, by modulating the mechanical forces of the microenvironment, we find that peristalsis impacts Shigella invasion. Collectively, our results reveal that Shigella leverages the intestinal microenvironment by taking advantage of the microarchitecture and mechanical forces to efficiently invade the intestine. This approach will enable molecular and mechanistic interrogation of human-restricted enteric pathogens.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Tight junctions (TJs) are essential to maintain intestinal . L-Arginine has beneficial effects on gut functions. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that L-arginine regulates the TJ network by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, which in turn improves intestinal  functions under HS. IEC-6 cells and rat small intestines were used as experiment models of heat stress. AICAR and dorsomorphin were used to activate and inhibit the AMPK pathway, respectively. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, differential gene expression and KEGG pathway analysis, intestinal paracellular permeability, intestinal morphology, and expression of HSP and TJ proteins, and p-AMPK were determined. L-Arginine promoted cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis after heat exposure at an optimal concentration of 5 mmol. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes associated with the HSP family and TJs were elevated by L-arginine. According to KEGG pathway analysis, L-arginine activated the AMPK signaling pathway. In vivo, intestinal damage resulted in obvious morphological changes as well as apoptosis with TUNEL and caspase-3 staining under HS and dorsomorphin treatments. Furthermore, HS and dorsomorphin increased the serum D-lactate concentration, diamine oxidase activity, and mRNA expression level of MLCK (P < 0.05). In contrast, L-arginine and AICAR treatments reduced intestinal injury, maintained intestinal permeability, and increased the villus/crypt ratio under hyperthermia. L-Arginine had the same effect as AICAR both in vitro and in vivo, namely increasing p-AMPK protein expression. L-Arginine and AICAR also upregulated the mRNA expression level of HSP70 and HSP90, and downregulated mRNA expression of MLCK (P < 0.05). The protein expression levels of TJ proteins ZO-1 and claudin-1 were suppressed by heat stroke and dorsomorphin, but enhanced by L-arginine and AICAR. Our findings indicate that activation of AMPK signaling by L-arginine is associated with improved intestinal mucosal  functions by enhancing the expression of TJs in rat small intestines and IEC-6 cells during HS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574846>Mechanisms of action of molecules with anti-TNF-alpha activity on intestinal  inflammation: A systematic review protocol.</a></h2><p>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), among cytokines that mediate the inflammatory process, plays an important role in diseases involving the loss of intestinal  .

The development and maturation of this microvasculature involves a complex interplay between endothelial cells with nearly all other brain cell types (pericytes, astrocytes, microglia, and neurons), orchestrated throughout embryogenesis and the first few weeks after birth in mice. Both the expansion and regression of vascular networks occur during the postnatal period of cerebrovascular remodeling. Pial vascular networks on the brain surface are dense at birth and are then selectively pruned during the postnatal period, with the most dramatic changes occurring in the pial venular network. This is contrasted to an expansion of subsurface capillary networks through the induction of angiogenesis. Concurrent with changes in vascular structure, the integration and cross talk of neurovascular cells lead to establishment of blood-brain   and neurovascular coupling to ensure precise control of macromolecular passage and metabolic supply. While we still possess a limited understanding of the rules that control cerebrovascular development, we can begin to assemble a view of how this complex process evolves, as well as identify gaps in knowledge for the next steps of research.

As orally transmitted viruses, densoviruses, are also challenged by the complexity of the insect gut barriers, more specifically by the chitinous peritrophic matrix, that lines and protects the midgut epithelium; how capsids stick to and cross these barriers to reach their final cell destination where replication goes has been poorly studied in insects. Here, we analyzed the early interaction of the  densovirus (JcDV) with the midgut barriers of caterpillars from the pest . Using combination of imaging, biochemical, proteomic and transcriptomic analyses, we examined in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo the early interaction of the capsids with the peritrophic matrix and the consequence of early oral infection on the overall gut function. We show that the JcDV particle rapidly adheres to the peritrophic matrix through interaction with different glycans including chitin and glycoproteins, and that these interactions are necessary for oral infection. Proteomic analyses of JcDV binding proteins of the peritrophic matrix revealed mucins and non-mucins proteins including enzymes already known to act as receptors for several insect pathogens. In addition, we show that JcDV early infection results in an arrest of -Acetylglucosamine secretion and a disruption in the  of the peritrophic matrix, which may help viral particles to pass through. Finally, JcDV early infection induces changes in midgut genes expression favoring an increased metabolism including an increased translational activity. These dysregulations probably participate to the overall dysfunction of the gut  in the early steps of viral pathogenesis. A better understanding of early steps of densovirus infection process is crucial to build biocontrol strategies against major insect pests.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545913>Endomucin restores depleted endothelial glycocalyx in the retinas of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Endothelial glycocalyx plays a significant role in the development and progression of diabetic complications. Endomucin (EMCN) is an anti-inflammatory membrane glycoprotein that is mainly expressed in venous and capillary endothelial cells. However, the function of EMCN in diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression is still completely unknown. We first investigated the change of EMCN expression in the retina and human retinal microvascular endothelial cells.

Furthermore, we investigated EMCN's protective effect against inflammation and blood-retinal  (BRB) destruction. We found that EMCN is specifically expressed in retinal endothelial cells and that its levels are decreased during hyperglycemia  and . Overexpression of EMCN can restore the retinal endothelial glycocalyx of STZ-induced diabetic rats. Furthermore, EMCN overexpression can decrease leukocyte-endothelial adhesion to ameliorate inflammation and stabilize the BRB to inhibit vessel leakage in rats with DR. EMCN may protect patients with diabetes from retinal vascular degeneration by restoring the endothelial glycocalyx.

Most of the known metallogrids are homometallic, though heterometallic systems that comprise two or more different metals promise higher level functionalities. However, heterometallic [n × n] grids are relatively rare, mostly because of the more challenging synthetic strategies.

Mg can regulate vascular functions, yet the mechanistic insight remains ill-defined. Data show that extracellular Mg enters endothelium mainly through the TRPM7 channel and MagT1 transporter. Mg can act as an antagonist to reduce Ca signaling in endothelium. Mg also reduces the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and inflammation. In addition, Mg-signaling increases endothelial survival and growth, adhesion, and migration. Endothelial   is significantly enhanced with Mg-treatment through S1P1-Rac1 pathways and -stabilizing mediators including cAMP, FGF1/2, and eNOS. Mg also promotes cytoskeletal reorganization and junction proteins to tighten up the . Moreover, Mg-deficiency enhances endothelial  permeability in mice, and Mg-treatment rescues histamine-induced transient vessel hyper-permeability in vivo. In summary, Mg-deficiency can cause deleterious effects in endothelium , and Mg-treatment may be effective in the prevention or treatment of vascular dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522585>Biological impact of nanodiamond particles - label free, high-resolution methods for nanotoxicity assessment.</a></h2><p>Current methods for the assessment of nanoparticle safety that are based on 2D cell culture models and fluorescence-based assays show limited sensitivity and they lack biomimicry. Consequently, the health risks associated with the use of many nanoparticles have not yet been established. There is a need to develop  models that mimic physiology more accurately and enable high throughput assessment. There is also a need to set up new assays that offer high sensitivity and are label-free. Here we developed 'mini-liver' models using scaffold-free bioprinting and used these models together with label-free nanoscale techniques for the assessment of toxicity of nanodiamond produced by laser-assisted technology. Results showed that NDs induced cytotoxicity in a concentration and exposure-time dependent manner. The loss of cell function was confirmed by increased cell stiffness, decreased cell membrane   and reduced cells mobility. We further showed that NDs elevated the production of reactive oxygen species and reduced cell viability. Our approach that combined mini-liver models with label-free high-resolution techniques showed improved sensitivity in toxicity assessment. Notably, this approach allowed for label-free semi-high throughput measurements of nanoparticle-cell interactions, thus could be considered as a complementary approach to currently used methods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609343>Assay for Blood-brain   in Drosophila melanogaster.</a></h2><p>Proper nervous system development includes the formation of the blood-brain , the diffusion  that tightly regulates access to the nervous system and protects neural tissue from toxins and pathogens.

The protein encoded by Claudin 1 (CLDN1), a member of the claudin family, is an integral membrane protein and a component of tight junction strands. CLDN1 has been proved to regulate the proliferation and metastasis of multiple tumors, but little is known about its role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Here, we found that CLDN1 was aberrantly increased in ESCC tissues and cell lines, and mainly distributed in the nucleus of tumor cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that CLDN1 promoted the proliferation and metastasis of ESCC by triggering autophagy both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, we validated that CLDN1-induced autophagy via increasing Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) expression through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling pathway in ESCC cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that aberrant expression and distribution of CLDN1 promoted the proliferation and metastasis of esophageal squamous carcinoma by triggering autophagy through AMPK/STAT1/ULK1 signaling pathway.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474879>Biomechanical Response of Lung Epithelial Cells to Iron Oxide and Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence shows that lungs can be damaged by inhalation of nanoparticles (NPs) at environmental and occupational settings. Recent findings have associated the exposure to iron oxide (FeO) and titanium dioxide (TiO) - NPs widely used in biomedical and clinical research - with pulmonary oxidative stress and inflammation. Although changes on cellular mechanics could contribute to pulmonary inflammation, there is no information regarding the effects of FeO and TiO on alveolar epithelial cell biomechanics. The aim was to investigate the NPs-induced biomechanical effects in terms of cell stiffness and traction forces exerted by human alveolar epithelial cells. Cell Young's modulus () measured by atomic force microscopy in alveolar epithelial cells significantly decreased after exposure to FeO and TiO (∼28 and ∼25%, respectively) compared to control conditions. Moreover, both NPs induced a similar reduction in the traction forces exerted by the alveolar epithelial cells in comparison to the control conditions. Accordingly, immunofluorescence images revealed a reduction of actomyosin stress fibers in response to the exposure to NPs. However, no inflammatory response was detected. In conclusion, an acute exposure of epithelial pulmonary cells to FeO and TiO NPs, which was mild since it was non-cytotoxic and did not induce inflammation, modified cell biomechanical properties which could be translated into damage of the epithelial  , suggesting that mild environmental inhalation of FeO and TiO NPs could not be innocuous.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31460824>Single Triglyceride-Rich Meal Destabilizes  Functions and Initiates Inflammatory Processes of Endothelial Cells.</a></h2><p>Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a single fat-rich meal on  functions and inflammatory status on human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs), furthermore we assess the effects of mixture of palmitic acid and 25-hydroxycholesterol (PA +25OHCH) on  of endothelial cells and their inflammatory properties. HUVECs were induced with serum of healthy volunteers taken before, and 3 h after, the consumption of a meal with a standardized daily required dose of fats. In addition, endothelial cells were induced with PA +25OHCH (800 μM/L+10 μg/mL). Total cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high sensitivity c-reactive protein, and glucose were measured at fasting and postprandially. HUVEC  was measured in the RTCA-DP xCELLigence system. mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-33, IL-32, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), CX3C-chemokine, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) occludin, and VE-cadherin was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Viability and apoptosis were assessed in flow cytometry. The level of VEGF and IL-33 in fasting and postprandial serum was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Three hours after consumption of a fatty meal, all patients displayed increased levels of TGs and Toll-like receptors (110 ± 37 mg/dL versus 182 ± 64 mg/dL  < 0.05) (24 ± 11 mg/dL versus 42 ± 14 mg/dL  < 0.05). Postprandial serum and PA +25OHCH caused >20% decrease of HUVEC  than fasting serum ( < 0.001). HUVEC disintegration was accompanied by a decrease of occludin mRNA expression as compared with fasting serum ( < 0.05). The fatty meal affected neither VE-cadherin mRNA expression nor its apoptosis ( > 0.05). Mixture of PA +25OHCH caused decrease of VE-cadherin mRNA expression as compared with fasting serum ( < 0.01). PA +25OHCH did not affect HUVEC apoptosis ( > 0.05). Postprandial serum and PA +25OHCH caused increase of IL-33, MCP-1, ICAM-1, IL-32, VEGF, and CX3C-chemokine mRNA expression as compared with fasting serum ( < 0.05). Moreover, level of VEGF in fatty serum was significantly higher ( < 0.001).

Claudin is an important structural and functional component of tight junctions and contributes to the formation of paracellular pathways for different populations of size- and charge-selective solutes. Therefore, modulation of tight junctions is important to develop drug delivery strategies. Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) causes food poisoning in humans and is a 35-kDa polypeptide, consisting of 319 amino acids and two functional regions. The C-terminal region of CPE (C-CPE) is not cytotoxic and binds to its receptor claudin, which in turn modulates the epithelial tight junction . Thus, claudin binders, such as C-CPE, are useful tools for drug delivery targeting tight junctions. Here, we provide a protocol for the expression and purification of recombinant C-CPE proteins as claudin binders, an analysis method for C-CPE binding affinity, and a procedure for assessing the effect of modulating tight junction .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470202>Lipopolysaccharide disrupts the cochlear blood-labyrinth  by activating perivascular resident macrophages and up-regulating MMP-9.</a></h2><p>To determine the distribution of perivascularresident macrophages (PVMs) in BLB and their relationship with capillaries, and to explore the possible mechanisms responsible for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of PVMs and the breakdown of BLB.Adult Balb/c mice were either trans-tympanically injected with LPS, or mock-treated. Auditory brainstem response was tested before and 48 h after treatments. Distribution of pericytes, PVMs and capillaries was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining, and BLB permeability was estimated by FITC-dextran leakage assay. Ultrastructure of stria vascularis was examined by transmission electron microscope. Protein and mRNA level of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), zona occludens-1 (ZO-1), interleukin-33 (IL-33) and its receptor suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) was measured by IHC and qRT-PCR.Unlike pericytes that surround one capillary, PVMs branched to connect with more than one capillary. LPS caused hearing loss in mice. Following LPS challenge, cochleae showed vascular leakage in stria vascularis, and PVMs presented morphological changes including reduced contact with capillaries. TEM revealed a reduced number of tight junction contact points between endothelial cells and a wider space between PVMs, pericytes and endothelial cells. The mRNA and protein levels of MMP-9 and ST2 in stria vascularis were up-regulated, while ZO-1 were down-regulated after exposure to LPS.Our results suggest that PVMs may play a more significant role than pericytes in maintaining the  of BLB. Our findings also reveal a possible mechanism contributing to LPS-induced activation of PVMs, breakdown of BLB and hearing loss.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The congenital or postoperative defects of sacral laminae, such as in patients with spina bifida, make this area more susceptible to forming progressive dural ectasia, pseudomeningocele, or expansile arachnoid cyst (Tarlov cyst). In addition, adhesions between the dura and surrounding soft tissue after laminectomy can cause some local symptoms, which are difficult to relieve. The authors propose that sacral laminoplasty with titanium mesh can provide a rigid support and  to resolve these sacral lesions and local symptoms.From January 2016 to December 2017, patients with progressive CSF-containing lesions in the sacral area and defective sacral laminae were included in the study. After repair of the lesion, the authors performed sacral laminoplasty with titanium mesh in each patient. Subsequently, the soft tissue and skin were closed primarily.A total of 6 patients were included. Four patients with repaired myelomeningocele had progressive dural ectasia. One patient with lipomyelomeningocele previously underwent detethering surgery and developed postoperative pseudomeningocele. One patient had a symptomatic Tarlov cyst. Four of these 6 cases presented with low-back pain and local tenderness. During follow-up, ranging from 13 to 37 months, all 6 patients experienced no recurrence of dural ectasia or pseudomeningocele and were free from local symptoms.Sacral laminoplasty with titanium mesh is a safe and effective procedure for treating progressive sacral dural ectasia and refractory pseudomeningocele, preventing CSF leakage as well as relieving local symptoms that may occur years after previous surgery for spina bifida.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553035>Quantifying the effects of engineered nanomaterials on endothelial cell architecture and vascular   using a cell pair model.</a></h2><p>Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are increasingly used in consumer products due to their unique physicochemical properties, but the specific hazards they pose to the structural and functional  of endothelial barriers remain elusive. When assessing the effects of ENMs on vascular  function, endothelial cell monolayers are commonly used as in vitro models. Monolayer models, however, do not offer a granular understanding of how the structure-function relationships between endothelial cells and tissues are disrupted due to ENM exposure. To address this issue, we developed a micropatterned endothelial cell pair model to quantitatively evaluate the effects of 10 ENMs (8 metal/metal oxides and 2 organic ENMs) on multiple cellular parameters and determine how these parameters correlate to changes in vascular  function. This minimalistic approach showed concerted changes in endothelial cell morphology, intercellular junction formation, and cytoskeletal organization due to ENM exposure, which were then quantified and compared to unexposed pairs using a "similarity scoring" method. Using the cell pair model, this study revealed dose-dependent changes in actin organization and adherens junction formation following exposure to representative ENMs (Ag, TiO2 and cellulose nanocrystals), which exhibited trends that correlate with changes in tissue permeability measured using an endothelial monolayer assay. Together, these results demonstrate that we can quantitatively evaluate changes in endothelial architecture emergent from nucleo-cytoskeletal network remodeling using micropatterned cell pairs. The endothelial pair model therefore presents potential applicability as a standardized assay for systematically screening ENMs and other test agents for their cellular-level structural effects on vascular barriers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31475964>Lucifer Yellow - A Robust Paracellular Permeability Marker in a Cell Model of the Human Blood-brain .</a></h2><p>The blood-brain  BBB consists of endothelial cells that form a  between the systemic circulation and the brain to prevent the exchange of non-essential ions and toxic substances.

Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested to be involved in the microvascular dysfunction and subsequent memory impairment. MicroRNA-124 (miR-124) is one of the most abundant miRNAs in the brain that is dysregulated in the hippocampus of AD animals. To explore the role of miR-124 in AD pathology, we employed the APP/PS1 transgenic mice and found downregulation of miR-124 and upregulation of complement C1q-like protein 3 (C1ql3) in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Downregulation of miR-124 expression resulted in Aβ deposition and a variety of cerebromicrovascular impairments, including the decline in microvascular density, reduced angiogenesis, accompanied by C1ql3 alteration. Treatment with lentivirus-mediated overexpression of miR-124 or the C1q inhibitor C1INH rescued breakdown of blood-brain , promoted angiogenesis and reduced Aβ deposition, and finally alleviated learning and memory deficit in APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, we found that C1ql3, a component of the classical complement, might be a potential target of miR-124. These results suggested that miR-124 was involved in the angiogenesis and vascular  in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex of the AD mice by regulating the classical complement C1ql3.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Gut dysbiosis is thought to be the critical factor in diabetic intestinal pathogenesis. As the most abundant commensal bacteria, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) play important roles in gut homeostasis. The microbial anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM), an F. prausnitzii metabolite, has anti-inflammatory potential in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Thus, we aimed to explore the function and mechanism of MAM on the diabetic intestinal epithelium.16S high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the gut microbiota of db/db mice (T2DM mouse model). We transfected a FLAG-tagged MAM plasmid into human colonic cells to explore the protein-protein interactions and observe cell monolayer permeability. For in vivo experiments, db/db mice were supplemented with recombinant His-tagged MAM protein from E. coli BL21 (DE3).The abundance of F. prausnitzii was downregulated in the gut microbiota of db/db mice. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and mass spectroscopy (MS) analyses revealed that MAM potentially interacts with proteins in the tight junction pathway, including zona occludens 1 (ZO-1). FLAG-tagged MAM plasmid transfection stabilized the cell permeability and increased ZO-1 expression in NCM460, Caco2, and HT-29 cells. The db/db mice supplemented with recombinant His-tagged MAM protein showed restored intestinal  function and elevated ZO-1 expression.Our study shows that MAM from F. prausnitzii can restore the intestinal  structure and function in DM conditions via the regulation of the tight junction pathway and ZO-1 expression.© 2019 The Authors.

Gut microbiota play pivotal roles in mediating psychological behaviors by regulating gut   and systemic inflammatory responses. Here, we found that oral sesamin administration (50 mg/kg·bodyweight/day) significantly attenuated depressive, aversive, repetitive, and anxiety-like behaviors in a long-term multiple nonsocial stress-treated mice model. Sesamin inhibited stress-induced gut   damage, reduced circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, and suppressed neuroinflammatory responses. Moreover, sesamin treatment also restructured the gut microbiome by enhancing the relative abundances of Bacteroidales and S24-7. The correlation analysis indicated that the microbiota composition changes were strongly correlated with behavioral disorders, serotonin, norepinephrine, and LPS levels. In conclusion, sesamin has preventive effects on stress-induced behavioral and psychological disorders, which might be highly related to the reshaped microbiota composition.

However, studies have yielded conflicting results on whether podocyte-specific angiotensin II (AngII) signaling directly induces podocyte injury. Previous research has found that after AngII stimulation, -arrestin-bound angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) is internalized in a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent manner, and that  and  double-knockout mice exhibit impaired clathrin-mediated endocytosis.We used podocyte-specific  double-knockout mice to examine AngII-stimulated AT1R internalization and signaling in primary podocytes and controls. We also examined the  effect of AngII in these double-knockout mice through renin-angiotensin system blockers and through deletion of  (which encodes the predominant AT1R isoform expressed in kidney, AT1aR). We tested calcium influx, Rac1 activation, and lamellipodial extension in control and primary podocytes of  double-knockout mice treated with AngII.We confirmed augmented AngII-stimulated AT1R signaling in primary  double-knockout podocytes resulting from arrest of clathrin-coated pit turnover. Genetic ablation of podocyte  in  double-knockout mice demonstrated improved albuminuria and kidney function compared with the double-knockout mice. Isolation of podocytes from  double-knockout mice revealed abnormal membrane dynamics, with increased Rac1 activation and lamellipodial extension, which was attenuated in  double-knockout podocytes lacking AT1aR.Our results indicate that inhibiting aberrant podocyte-associated AT1aR signaling pathways has a protective effect in maintaining the  of the glomerular filtration .Copyright © 2019 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664037>Transcriptomic profile of cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells undergoing repair.</a></h2><p>Pathological remodeling of the airway epithelium is commonly observed in Cystic Fibrosis (CF).

The present work attempted to assess the efficacy and mechanisms of Berberis lycium Royle fruit extract (BLFE) in mitigating chemical-induced colitis in mice.Colitis was induced in Balb/C mice using dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) and protective effects of BLFE were examined. Several oxi-inflammatory parameters, histopathological changes, epithelial   and activation of NF-κB/c-Jun/MAPKs in colon tissue were determined. Splenic T cell subpopulations were also gauged to evaluate the systemic effects of BLFE in the modulation of immune responses.BLFE treatment effectively improved animal survival rate, DAI score, colon length and structural damage in DSS-exposed mice. Expression of oxi-inflammatory markers such as MPO, IgE, iNOS, ICAM-1, MCP-1 and RANTES as well as Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines were decreased in BLFE treated animals. On the other hand, an increased mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4/IL-10), tight junction proteins and IgA levels were also observed during BLFE treatment. BLFE appeared to modulate intestinal epithelial cell proliferation (PCNA) and apoptosis (Bcl2/Bax), thereby suggesting its role in the maintenance of intestinal . Analysis of inflammatory signalling pathways indicated robust activation and expression of NF-κB/c-Jun/MAPKs (JNK and p38) in DSS treated animal which was strongly abrogated by BLFE treatment. BLFE supplementation also enhanced the proliferation of CD3CD4CD25 Treg cells indicating suppression of inflammatory activation.These observations provide compelling evidence that BLFE could be considered as a viable natural strategy in the prevention and management of ulcerative colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533100>Glutamine Blocks Interleukin-13-Induced Intestinal Epithelial  Dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Impaired intestinal epithelial  function is a hallmark of a variety of pathological conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBD patients with IBS-like symptoms show higher interleukin-13 (IL-13) serum levels and poor psychological well-being. Supplementary glutamine reduced the daily bowel movement frequency, improved the stool form, and normalized intestinal hyperpermeability. This study was aimed at assessing the effects of IL-13 and supplementary glutamine on human intestinal epithelial function in vitro.Caco-2 cells were grown on TranswellTM inserts. -IL-13 was added to the basolateral compartment, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled-dextran permeability measured. Effects of glutamine or the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 were assessed. Involvement of tight junction proteins was assessed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining.IL-13 significantly decreased TEER and increased FITC labeled-dextran epithelial permeability. IL-13 stimulation decreased the claudin-1 expression and increased the claudin-2 expression. Glutamine alleviated IL-13-induced decrease of TEER and increase of FITC labeled-dextran permeability. Further, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor showed this alleviating effect while the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 inhibitor did not.IL-13 induced   impairment by decreasing claudin-1 and increasing claudin-2.

In this commentary, we describe how STIs interact with the immune and non-immune cells, both within and below the cervicovaginal mucosal , to cause inflammation, which in turn has been associated with increased HIV acquisition risk.STIs have a major impact on the female genital mucosa, which is an important biological and physical  that forms the first line of defence against invading microorganisms such as HIV. Pattern recognition of STI pathogens, by receptors expressed either on the cell surface or inside the cell, typically triggers inflammation at the mucosal . The types of mucosal responses vary by STI, and can be asymptomatic or culminate in the formation of discharge, ulcers and/or warts. While the aim of this response is to clear the invading microbes, in many cases these responses are either evaded or cause pathology that impairs   and increases HIV access to target cells in the sub-mucosa. In addition, innate responses to STIs can result in an increased number of immune cells, including those that are the primary targets of HIV, and may contribute to the association between STIs and increased susceptibility to HIV acquisition. Many of these cells are mediators of adaptive immunity, including tissue-resident cells that may also display innate-like functions. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is another common cause of inflammation, and evidence for multiple interactions between BV, STIs and HIV suggest that susceptibility to these conditions should be considered in concert.STIs and other microbes can induce inflammation in the genital tract, perturbing the normal robust function of the mucosal  against HIV. While the impact of STIs on the mucosal immune system and HIV acquisition is often under-appreciated, understanding their interactions of the infections with the immune responses play an important role in improving treatment and reducing the risk of HIV acquisition. The frequent sub-clinical inflammation associated with STIs underscores the need for better STI diagnostics to reverse the immunological consequences of infection.© 2019 The Authors.

However, magnitudes of toxic effects, induced by MCs, depend on route and magnitude of exposure to the toxin. In the present study, male mice were orally exposed 1, 10 or 100 μg/L MC-LR for 90 or 180 days, and pathological approach and the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomics were employed with testes. Proteomics revealed that a number of differentially altered proteins may be involved in MC-LR-induced chronic testicular toxicity. The biological process analysis indicated the altered proteins played an important role in biological adhesion, cellular process, response to stimulus or rhythmic process. The cellular component analysis revealed that most of the proteins with altered expression associated with cell part, extracellular region, extracellular region part, membrane, membrane part, organelle or organelle part. The molecular function showed that these proteins were critical in molecular transducer activity.  analyses provide first compelling evidence that MC-LR significantly cause dysfunction of blood-testis  (BTB) through affecting tight junctions and gap junctions. Moreover, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT eventually contributed to injury result from chronic low-level MC-LR treatment. Identification of proteins in testis responsive to MC-LR provides insights into molecular mechanisms of chronic toxicity of MCs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we hypothesize that Zika virus (ZIKV) infects the brain via a disrupted BBB and altered expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins, which are structural components of the BBB. To assess this hypothesis,  and  studies were performed using three different strains of ZIKV: Honduras (ZIKV-H), Puerto Rico (ZIKV-PR), and Uganda (ZIKV-U). Primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were productively infected by all studied ZIKV strains at MOI 0.01, and were analyzed by plaque assay, immunofluorescence for NS1 protein, and qRT-PCR at 2 and 6 days post-infection (dpi). Compared to mock-infected controls, expression level of ZO-1 was significantly upregulated in ZIKV-H-infected BMECs, while occludin and claudin-5 levels were significantly downregulated in BMECs infected by all three studied viral strains. Interestingly, BMEC permeability was not disturbed by ZIKV infection, even in the presence of a very high viral load (MOI 10). All studied ZIKV strains productively infected wild-type C57BL/J mice after intravenous infection with 10 PFU. Viral load was detected in the plasma, spleen, and brain from 1 to 8 dpi. Peak brain infection was observed at 2 dpi; therefore, TJ protein expression was assessed at this time point. Claudin-5 was significantly downregulated in ZIKV-U-infected animals and the BBB  was significantly disturbed in ZIKV-H-infected animals. Our results suggest that ZIKV penetrates the brain parenchyma early after infection with concurrent alterations of TJ protein expression and disruption of the BBB permeability in a strain-dependent manner.Copyright © 2019 Leda, Bertrand, Andras, El-Hage, Nair and Toborek.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610210>LncRNA Snhg3 contributes to dysfunction of cerebral microvascular cells in intracerebral hemorrhage rats by activating the TWEAK/Fn14/STAT3 pathway.</a></h2><p>LncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 3 (Snhg3) has been involved in cell proliferation and migration in malignant cells. However, its role in regulating functions of non-malignant cells has been hardly reported. Here, we found Snhg3 expression was sharply induced in primary brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs) treated with oxygen-and-glucose-deprivation (OGD) plus hemin, an in vitro model of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Downregulation of Snhg3 by siRNA transfection improved cell proliferation and migration abilities and reduced cell apoptosis and monolayer permeability in BMVECs under treatment with OGD plus hemin. Snhg3 overexpression suppressed cell proliferation and migration and increased cell apoptosis and monolayer permeability under normal condition. In ICH rats, downregulation of Snhg3 by siRNA injection improved behavioral and histological manifestations, including number of right turns, limb placement score,  of blood-brain  (BBB), brain water content and cell apoptosis in vivo. In the mechanism exploration, we found that, TWEAK and Snhg3 displayed a positive correlation with each other. Snhg3 overexpression increased expression of TWEAK protein and its receptor Fn14, that were also induced by OGD plus hemin, activating the downstream neuroinflammatory pathway STAT3 and enhancing the secretion of MMP-2/9. Finally, the TWEAK-siRNA, the Fn14 inhibitor ATA and the STAT3 blocker AG490 were respectively used to treat BMVECs under treatment with OGD plus hemin. Our results showed either TWEAK downregulation, Fn14 inhibition, or STAT3 blockade, could rescue Snhg3-induced impairment of BMVEC functions. In conclusion, the lncRNA Snhg3 contributes to dysfunction of cerebral microvascular cells in ICH rats by activating the TWEAK/Fn14/STAT3 pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The leakage of BBB contributes to the infiltration of peripheral immune cells and harmful mediators into brain parenchyma, even the drugs that can not cross BBB under physiological conditions. Therefore, PD has been regarded as not only a neurodegenerative disease, but also a systemic disorder. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that Dexrazoxane (Dex), a drug clinically used to reduce doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in chemotherapy, can enter into midbrain and striatum through broken BBB in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)- and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced rodent models of PD. Unexpectedly, Dex (1.5, 5, 15 mg/kg, i.p.) administration for 3-week significantly ameliorates apomorphine-induced contralateral rotation behavior in 6-OHDA-treated rats and Dex (10 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment for 5-week improves MPTP-induced mouse motor dysfunctions. We find that Dex administration protects dopaminergic neurons against neurotoxin-induced degeneration in SNc, accompanied by the attenuated glial cell activation. Further study indicates that suppression of oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, as well as the inhibition of systemic inflammation in both peripheral tissues and brain, contribute to the neuroprotective effects of Dex in PD models. Our study implies that Dex may serve as an effective neuroprotectant to treat neurodegeneration and has potential clinical value in term of PD therapeutics.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

G protein-coupled receptor 124 (GPR124) has been reported to be required for maintaining central nervous system (CNS) angiogenesis and blood-brain  . However, the molecular mechanisms by which GPR124 regulates pericytes during ischemia have remained elusive. : A microsphere embolism-induced ischemia model was used to evaluate the expression of GPR124 following microsphere embolism. Immunocytochemistry and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy imaging were used to assess the expression and distribution of GPR124 in human brain vascular pericytes (HBVPs) and after the treatment with 3-morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1) or oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). The effect of GPR124 knockdown or overexpression on HBVP migration was analyzed in vitro using wound healing assays and a microfluidic device. GPR124 loss-of-function studies were performed in HBVPs and HEK293 cells using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene deletion. Time-lapse imaging was used to assess dynamic changes in the formation of filopodia in an individual cell. Finally, to explore the functional domains required for GPR124 activity, deletion mutants were constructed for each of the N-terminal domains. : GPR124 expression was increased in pericytes following microsphere embolism. Morphological analysis showed localization of GPR124 to focal adhesions where GPR124 bound directly to the actin binding protein vinculin and upregulated Cdc42. SIN-1 or OGD treatment redistributed GPR124 to the leading edges of HBVPs where GPR124 signaling was required for pericyte filopodia formation and directional migration. Partial deletion of GPR124 domains decreased SIN-1-induced filopodia formation and cell migration. : Taken together, our results provide the first evidence for a role of GPR124 in pericyte migration under ischemic conditions and suggest that GPR124 was essential for Cdc42 activation and filopodia formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578921>GHRH antagonists support lung endothelial  function.</a></h2><p>Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone (GHRH) regulates the release of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary gland. GHRH also acts as a growth and inflammatory factor in a variety of experimental models in oncology. In the current study, we used bovine pulmonary arterial cells in order to investigate the effects of GHRH and its antagonistic and agonistic analogs in key intracellular pathways that regulate endothelial permeability. GHRH antagonists suppressed the activation of MLC2, ERK1/2, JAK2/STAT3 pathway and increased the intracellular P53 and pAMPK levels. In contrast, both GHRH and GHRH agonist MR409 exerted the opposite effects. Furthermore, GHRH antagonists supported the  of endothelial , while GHRH and GHRH agonists had the contrary effects, as reflected in measurements of transendothelial resistance. Our observations support the evidence for the anti - inflammatory role of GHRH antagonists in the vasculature.

Over time, normal skin aging is accelerated by external stresses such as smoking, pollution, chemical products and radiation. UV light, in particular UVA, causes DNA damage, apoptosis and morphological modifications, which are responsible for both premature aging and cancer. The aim of this study was to establish a discriminatory and sufficiently reproducible cutaneous model for evaluating UVA damage, to enable testing for effectiveness of potentially protective compounds.The cutaneous model is based on Human skin explants irradiated with UVA. Deleterious effects on epidermis were observed and quantified by haematoxylin-eosin staining and by immunofluorescence of ɣ-H2Ax, cytokeratin 5, involucrin and loricrin protein. Dermis deterioration was evaluated by transmission electronic microscopy and zymography in situ.We were able to observe and quantify deleterious effects associated with UVA irradiation: epidermal and dermal disruption, appearance of Sunburn cells, increased DNA damage and induced apoptosis. The use of this model in the evaluation of protective compounds was first confirmed using sunscreens, then further validated with a panel of active ingredients which showed beneficial effects on epidermis morphology and DNA  after UVA exposure.We have developed a model and a standardised protocol, based on the use of human skin explants, which allows us to explore the protective effect of active ingredients to environmental stresses such as UVA.This article is protected by copyright.

However, the tissue-specific mechanisms that control the activation of these innate lymphocytes are not known. Here, we demonstrate that CD109, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein highly expressed by keratinocytes, is an important regulator of skin homeostasis and γδ17 cell activation. Genetic deletion of CD109 results in spontaneous epidermal hyperplasia, aberrant accumulation of dermal-derived γδ17 cells, and enhanced susceptibility to psoriasiform inflammation. In this context, γδ17 activation requires interleukin (IL)-23 signals and is reversed by transient depletion of the skin microbiota. Mechanistically, CD109 restrains γδ17 cell activation in a cell-extrinsic manner by fortifying skin  .

The related injury pathogenesis is mainly focused on the liver. Here, we report that gut  disruption may also be involved in APAP hepatotoxicity. APAP administration led to gut leakiness and colonic epithelial chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 7 (CCL7) up-regulation. Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific CCL7 transgenic mice (CCL7 mice) showed markedly increased myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) phosphorylation and elevated gut permeability and bacterial translocation into the liver compared to wild-type mice. Global transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of hepatic pro-inflammatory genes was enhanced in CCL7 mice compared to wild-type animals. Moreover, CCL7 overexpression in intestinal epithelial cells significantly augmented APAP-induced acute liver injury. Our data provides new evidence that dysfunction of CCL7-mediated gut   may be an important contributor to APAP-induced hepatotoxicity.Copyright © 2019.

Seeking the initiating events, we tested the hypothesis that the intestine could be damaged by repeated lipid supply and therefore participate in inflammation. In mice, 1-5 palm oil gavages increased intestinal permeability via decreased expression and mislocalization of junctional proteins at the cell-cell contacts; altered the intestinal bacterial species by decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria, and Clostridium leptum; and increased inflammatory cytokine expression. This was further studied in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2/TC7 cells using the two main components of palm oil, i.e., palmitic and oleic acid. Saturated palmitic acid impaired paracellular permeability and junctional protein localization, and induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the cells, but unsaturated oleic acid did not. Inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis prevented part of these effects. Altogether, our data show that short exposure to palm oil or palmitic acid induces intestinal dysfunctions targeting   and inflammation. Excessive palm oil consumption could be an early player in the gut alterations observed in metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019.

The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of RAS are altered in AD in relation to established CSF markers of disease pathology (lower Aβ42 and elevated tau) and CSF markers of capillary dysfunction. We studied 40 controls and 40 AD cases grouped according to a biomarker profile (i.e., AD cases t-tau>400 pg/mL, pTau >60 pg/mL, and Aβ42 <550 pg/mL). Angiotensin-II converting enyme-1 (ACE1) and ACE2 enzyme activity was measured using fluorogenic peptide substrates; sPDGFRβ and albumin level by sandwich ELISA and angiotensin-I (Ang-I), Ang-II, and Ang-(1-7) by direct ELISA. CSF Aβ42, total, and phosphorylated tau levels were previously measured by INNOTEST sandwich ELISA. CSF ACE1 activity was significantly elevated in AD (p = 0.008) and positively correlated with ACE2 in AD (r = 0.420, p = 0.007). CSF ACE1 weakly correlated with t-tau (r = 0.294, p = 0.066) and p-tau (r = 0.329, p = 0.038) but not with Aβ42 in the controls but not in AD. ACE1 correlated positively with sPDGFRβ (r = 0.426, p = 0.007), a marker of pericyte injury, and ACE2 correlated positively with albumin (r = 0.422, p = 0.008), a marker of blood-brain  integrity.

The production of 20-HETE is elevated after the onset of both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes; on the other hand, subjects with genetic variants in  and  that reduce 20-HETE production are more susceptible to stroke.

Aberrant autophagy also contributes to AMD pathology, as autophagy maintains RPE homeostasis to ensure blood-retinal  (BRB)  and protect photoreceptors. Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) promotes cellular oxidative stress by inhibiting thioredoxin reducing capacity and is in turn inversely regulated by reactive oxygen species levels; however, its role in oxidative stress-induced RPE cell dysfunction and the mechanistic link between TXNIP and autophagy are largely unknown. Here, we observed that TXNIP expression was rapidly downregulated in RPE cells under oxidative stress and that RPE cell proliferation was decreased. TXNIP knockdown demonstrated that the suppression of proliferation resulted from TXNIP depletion-induced autophagic flux, causing increased p53 activation via nuclear localization, which in turn enhanced AMPK phosphorylation and activation. Moreover, TXNIP downregulation further negatively impacted BRB  by disrupting RPE cell tight junctions and enhancing cell motility by phosphorylating, and thereby activating, Src kinase. Finally, we also revealed that TXNIP knockdown upregulated HIF-1α, leading to the enhanced secretion of VEGF from RPE cells and the stimulation of angiogenesis in cocultured human retinal microvascular endothelial cells. This suggests that the exposure of RPE cells to sustained oxidative stress may promote choroidal neovascularization, another AMD pathology. Together, these findings reveal three distinct mechanisms by which TXNIP downregulation disrupts RPE cell function and thereby exacerbates AMD pathogenesis. Accordingly, reinforcing or restoring BRB  by targeting TXNIP may serve as an effective therapeutic strategy for preventing or attenuating photoreceptor damage in AMD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31475977>Isolation and Purification of Murine Cardiac Pericytes.</a></h2><p>Pericytes, perivascular cells of microvessels and capillaries, are known to play a part in angiogenesis, vessel stabilization, and endothelial  . However, their tissue-specific functions in the heart are not well understood. Moreover, there is currently no protocol utilizing readily accessible materials to isolate and purify pericytes of cardiac origin. Our protocol focuses on using the widely used mammalian model, the mouse, as our source of cells. Using the enzymatic digestion and mechanical dissociation of heart tissue, we obtained a crude cell mixture that was further purified by fluorescence activating cell sorting (FACS) by a plethora of markers. Because there is no single unequivocal marker for pericytes, we gated for cells that were CD31CD34CD45CD140bNG2CD146.

Paracellular permeability is governed by intercellular tight-junctions (TJs). Zonulin is, to date, the only known physiological regulator of intestinal TJs. We used a zonulin transgenic mouse (Ztm) model characterized by increased small intestinal permeability to elucidate the role of a primary impaired gut  on microbiome composition and/or immune profile. Ztm exhibit an altered gene expression profile of TJs in the gut compared to wild-type mice (WT): Claudin-15, Claudin-5, Jam-3, and Myosin-1C are decreased in the male duodenum whereas Claudin-15, Claudin-7, and ZO-2 are reduced in the female colon. These results are compatible with loss of gut  function and are paralleled by an altered microbiota composition with reduced abundance of the genus , known to have positive effects on gut   and strengthening, and an increased abundance of the  genus, associated to low-grade inflammatory conditions. Immune profile analysis shows a subtly skewed distribution of immune cell subsets toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype with more IL-17 producing adaptive and innate-like T cells in Ztm. Interestingly, microbiota "normalization" involving the transfer of WT microbiota into Ztm, did not rescue the altered immune profile. Our data suggest that a primary impaired gut  causing an uncontrolled trafficking of microbial products leads to a latent pro-inflammatory status, with a skewed microbiota composition and immune profile that, in the presence of an environmental trigger, as we have previously described (1), might promote the onset of overt inflammation and an increased risk of chronic disease.Copyright © 2019 Miranda-Ribera, Ennamorati, Serena, Cetinbas, Lan, Sadreyev, Jain, Fasano and Fiorentino.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31475432>White matter  and functional predictors of response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for posttraumatic stress disorder and major depression.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence suggests that therapeutic repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an effective treatment for pharmacoresistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD). We recently demonstrated that response to 5 Hz TMS administered to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was predicted by functional connectivity of the medial prefrontal (MPFC) and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). This functionally-defined circuit is a novel target for treatment optimization research, however, our limited knowledge of the structural pathways that underlie this functional predisposition is a  to target engagement research.To investigate underlying structural elements of our previous functional connectivity findings, we submitted pre-TMS diffusion-weighted imaging data from 20 patients with PTSD and MDD to anatomically constrained tract-based probabilistic tractography (FreeSurfer's TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy). Averaged pathway fractional anisotropy (FA) was extracted from four frontal white matter tracts: the forceps minor, cingulum, anterior thalamic radiations (ATRs), and uncinate fasciculi. Tract FA statistics were treated as explanatory variables in backward regressions testing the relationship between tract  and functional connectivity coefficients from MPFC and sgACC predictors of symptom improvement after TMS.FA in the ATRs was consistently associated with symptom improvement in PTSD and MDD (Bonferroni-corrected p < .05).We found that structural characteristics of the ATR account for significant variance in individual-level functional predictors of post-TMS improvement. TMS optimization studies should target this circuit either in stand-alone or successive TMS stimulation protocols.© Published 2019.

The study aimed to characterize hBMEPCs in vitro under normogenic conditions. hBMEPCs were cultured at different time points. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect concentrations of angiogenic factors (VEGF-A, angiogenin-1, and endoglin) and angiogenic inhibitor endostatin in conditioned media. Double immunocytochemical staining for CD105, ZO-1, and occludin with F-actin was performed. Results showed predominantly gradual significant post-culture increases of VEGF-A and angiogenin-1 levels. Cultured cells displayed distinct rounded or elongated cellular morphologies and positively immunoexpressed for CD105, indicating EC phenotype. Cytoskeletal F-actin filaments were re-arranged according to cell morphologies. Immunopositive expressions for ZO-1 were detected near inner cell membrane and for occludin on cell membrane surface of adjacent hBMEPCs. Together, secretion of angiogenic factors by cultured cells provides evidence for a potential mechanism underlying endogenous EC repair in ALS through hBMEPC transplantation, leading to restored  .

We found that a large number of NPs were internalized by cells in a time-dependent manner determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), which was further supported by intracellular accumulation of iron via X-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging. Moreover, confocal imaging showed that these NPs mainly located in the lysosomes where they remained stable and undissolved within 72 hours, which was verified by chemical form characterization of iron via Fe K-edge X-ray adsorption near edge structure (XANES). With the coating shell of HCS, the release of iron ions was prevented even in acidic lysosome and the  of lysosomal membrane remained unchanged during the storage of NPs. As a result, Fe₃O₄@HCS NPs exhibited low level of oxidative stress and induced negligible cytotoxicity towards HepG2 cells. Based on the powerful techniques, we demonstrated that the carbon outer layer provides a physical  that helps remain excellent properties of magnetic Fe₃O₄ NPs and good dispersity, chemical stability, as well as biocompatibility for potential applications in biomedical fields.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666540>Cigarette smoke extract exacerbates hyperpermeability of cerebral endothelial cells after oxygen glucose deprivation and reoxygenation.</a></h2><p>Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for stroke and is linked to stroke severity. Previous studies have shown that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) triggers endothelial dysfunction in vitro by initiating oxidative stress and/or an inflammatory response. In addition, cerebral endothelial dysfunction (particularly at the level of the blood-brain  [BBB]) contributes to stroke pathogenesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that cigarette smoking may influence stroke, at least in part, by exacerbating ischaemia-induced BBB disruption. To test this, we examined the effect of CSE on the permeability of cerebral endothelial cells exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD + RO). We found that the loss of BBB  following ischaemic/reperfusion-like conditions was significantly worsened by CSE. Despite this being associated with increased mRNA expression of Nox catalytic subunits, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were however markedly lower. Furthermore, this occurred in association with elevated expression of antioxidant enzymes (SOD1, SOD2, and Gpx-1), suggesting an antioxidant defence response. Lastly, we found that CSE significantly upregulated mRNA expression of cytokines (IL-6 and TGF-β). Collectively, these results show that acute exposure to CSE worsens BBB disruption caused by OGD + RO, however, this is not linked to elevated ROS levels but may involve inflammatory mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629525>Short communication: Processed bovine colostrum milk protein concentrate increases epithelial   of Caco-2 cell layers.</a></h2><p>Colostrum plays an important role in initiating the development of the intestinal  in newborn mammals. Given its bioactivity, there is much interest in the potential use of bovine colostrum to improve human gastrointestinal health throughout the life span. There is evidence that bovine colostrum is effective at improving small intestinal   and some indication that it may alter colonic motility. However, for colostrum to be used as a product to improve intestinal health, it needs to be bioactive after processing. The aim of this study was to determine whether industrial processing of bovine colostrum affects its ability to improve small intestinal   or alter distal colon motility. Three colostrum sample types were compared; raw whole colostrum powder (WCP), raw skim colostrum powder (SCP), and industrially produced colostrum milk protein concentrate (CMPC). To determine whether these colostrum powders had different effects on small intestinal  , their effects on the transepithelial electrical resistance across an in vitro intestinal epithelial layer (Caco-2 cells) were measured, both with and without a challenge from the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α. These results showed that CMPC enhanced transepithelial electrical resistance across unchallenged epithelial cell layers, whereas the raw colostrum samples, WCP and SCP, did not have an effect. The colostrum samples were also compared to determine how they affect contractility in the distal colon isolated from the rat. Skim colostrum powder was the only sample to act directly on colonic tissue to modulate motility, increasing the amplitude of contractions. The results show that bovine colostrum is able to improve small intestinal   and alter colon motility, and they implicate different components. The   enhancement was apparent only in the industrial CMPC, which may have been due to the increase in protein concentration or the release of small peptides as a result of processing. The ability to alter colon motility was present in SCP but absent in WCP, again implying that an increase in protein concentration is responsible for the effect. However, this effect was not apparent for the industrially processed CMPC, suggesting denaturation or degradation of the active component. The beneficial effect of colostrum on small intestinal   was present after processing, confirming that it is feasible to industrially produce an active product for gut health.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Although the mechanism is still unknown, some studies have shown that cigarette exposure affects the intestinal  of the small bowel. Among the factors that may be involved in this process are Paneth cells. These specialized epithelial cells are located into the small intestine, and they are able to secrete antimicrobial peptides, having an essential role in the control of the growth of microorganisms. Alterations in its function are associated with inflammatory processes, such as CD. To study how cigarette components impact ileum homeostasis and Paneth cells , we used intragastric administration of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) in mice. Our results showed that inflammation was triggered after mucosal exposure of CSC, which induced particular alterations in Paneth cells granules, antimicrobial peptide production, and a reduction of bactericidal capacity. In fact, exposure to CSC generated an imbalance in the fecal bacterial population and increased the susceptibility of mice to develop ileal damage in response to bacterial infection. Moreover, our results obtained in mice unable to produce interleukin 10 (IL-10 mice) suggest that CSC treatment can induce a symptomatic enterocolitis with a pathological inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals.Copyright © 2019 Berkowitz, Pardo-Roa, Salazar, Salazar-Echegarai, Miranda, Ramírez, Chávez, Kalergis, Bueno and Álvarez-Lobos.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653761>A small molecule protects mitochondrial  by inhibiting mTOR activity.</a></h2><p>Apoptosis activation by cytochrome  release from mitochondria to cytosol is a normal cellular response to mitochondrial damage. Using cellular apoptosis assay, we have found small-molecule apoptosis inhibitors that protect cells from mitochondrial damage.

The aim of the study was to determine whether lipopolysaccharide of E. coli (E. coli LPS) may affect endothelial  and modify IL-10 expression in dendritic cells (DCs). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and monocyte-derived DCs were treated with E. coli LPS, apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100) and 7-ketocholesterol (7-kCH) - harmful oxidized form of cholesterol. The effect of E. coli LPS, 7-kCH and ApoB100 on the  functions of HUVECs in real-time cell electric impedance sensing system (RTCA-DP) was assessed. Furthermore, the effect of 7-kCH and ApoB100 on  functions of HUVECs co-cultured with DCs previously treated with LPS was analyzed. Both E. coli LPS and 7-kCH decreased  functions of HUVECs and reduced tight junction proteins mRNA expression, whereas ApoB100 increased endothelial . In DCs, ApoB100 and E. coli LPS decreased IL-10 mRNA expression. In HUVECs co-cultured with DCs treated with LPS and subsequently pulsed with ApoB100 or 7-kCH IL-10 mRNA expression was lower. E. coli LPS-exposed DCs diminished the protective effect of ApoB100 on endothelial  and led to the decrease of occludin mRNA expression. LPS potentially derived from gut microflora may destabilize endothelial  together with oxidized cholesterol and intensify the immunogenicity of ApoB100.© 2019 APMIS.

We investigated whether and how endothelial production of MVs contribute to vascular dysfunction during inflammation.We measured the levels and molecular properties of endothelial-derived MVs (EC-MVs) from mouse plasma following a septic injury elicited by cecal ligation and puncture, as well as those from supernatants of cultured endothelial cells stimulated by inflammatory agents including cytokines, thrombin, and complement 5a. The mouse studies showed that sepsis caused a significant increase in total plasma vesicles and VE-cadherin+ EC-MVs compared to sham control. In cultured ECs, different inflammatory agents caused diverse patterns of EC-MV production and cargo contents. When topically applied to endothelial cells, EC-MVs induced a cytoskeleton-junction response characterized by myosin light chain phosphorylation, contractile fiber reorganization, VE-cadherin phosphorylation and adherens junction dissociation, functionally measured as increased albumin transendothelial flux and decreased  resistance. The endothelial response was coupled with protein tyrosine phosphorylation promoted by MV cargo containing c-Src kinase, whereas MVs produced from c-Src deficient cells did not exert -disrupting effects. Additionally, EC-MVs contribute to endothelial inflammatory injury by promoting neutrophil-endothelium adhesion and release of neutrophil extracellular traps containing citrullinated histones and myeloperoxidase, a response unaltered by c-Src knockdown.Endothelial-derived microparticles cause endothelial  dysfunction by impairing adherens junctions and activating neutrophils. The signaling mechanisms underlying the endothelial cytoskeleton-junction response to EC-MVs involve protein phosphorylation promoted by MV cargo carrying c-Src. However, EC-MV induced neutrophil activation was not dependent on c-Src.Circulating microvesicles derived from blood/vascular cells not only serve as serological markers of disease, but also play a pathogenic role in vascular inflammation. In this study, we characterized the production and molecular signature of microparticles produced by endothelial cells under inflammatory conditions. We discovered that these vesicles carry Src-bearing cargo which interact with endothelial cells inducing cytoskeleton contractile stress and impaired VE-cadherin junction . Additionally, endothelial-derived MVs are capable of stimulating neutrophil-endothelium adhesion and production of neutrophil extracellular traps containing citrullinated histones and myeloperoxidase. These novel findings have the potential to be translated into the development of diagnostic or therapeutic strategies to treat inflammatory disease.© The Author(s) 2019.

Renovascular hypertension represents the most common cause of secondary hypertension, and its progress is associated with overactivation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), causing systemic and local changes. Aliskiren is a renin-inhibiting drug that optimizes RAAS suppression. In this sense, the objective of the present study was to analyze the morphophysiology of the left kidney in Wistar rats with renovascular hypertension after treatment with Aliskiren. Parameters such as systolic blood pressure, urinary creatinine and protein excretion, renal cortex structure and ultrastructure, fibrosis and tissue inflammation were analyzed. Our results showed that the hypertensive animals treated with Aliskiren presented a reestablishment of blood pressure, expression of renin, and renal function, as well as a remodeling of morphological alterations through the reduction of fibrosis. The treatment regulated the laminin expression and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines, restoring the  of the glomerular filtration . Therefore, our findings suggest that Aliskiren has a renoprotective effect acting on the improvement of the morphology, physiology and pathology of the renal cortex of animals with renovascular hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474986>Autoimmune-Mediated Retinopathy in CXCR5-Deficient Mice as the Result of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Associated Proteins Accumulation.</a></h2><p>Previous research has shown that CXCR5 mice develop retinal degeneration (RD) with age, a characteristic related to age macular degeneration (AMD). RD in these mice is not well-understood, and in this study, we sought to characterize further the RD phenotype and to gain mechanistic insights into the function of CXCR5 in the retina. CXCR5 and WT control mice were used. Fundus images demonstrated a significant ( < 0.001) increase of hypo-pigmented spots in the retina of aged CXCR5 mice compared with WT control mice. PAS staining indicated localization of deposits in the sub-retinal pigment epithelia (RPE) layer. AMD-associated proteins Cryab, amyloid beta, and C3d were detected within the RPE/sub-RPE tissues by immunofluorescence (IF). In addition, western blot analysis of COX-2, Arg1, and VEGF-a revealed an increase in the signaling of these molecules within the RPE/choroid complex. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated a drusen-like structure of sub-RPE deposits with an accumulation of vacuolated cellular debris. Loss of photoreceptors was detected by peanut lectin staining and was corroborated by a reduction in MAP2 signaling. Loss of blood-retinal   was demonstrated by a reduction of ZO-1 expression. Inflammatory cells were detected in the sub-RPE space, with an increase in IBA-1 positive microglia cells on the surface of the RPE. Mass spectrometry analysis of CXCR5 mouse RPE/choroid proteins extracts, separated by SDS-page and incubated with autologous serum, identified autoantibodies against AMD-associated proteins: Cryaa, Cryab, and Anxa2.  evaluations in BV-2 cell culture indicated a significant increase in production of Arg-1 ( < 0.001) and COX-2 ( < 0.01) in the presence of anti-CXCR5 antibody when compared with Igg-treated control BV-2 cells stimulated with IL-4 and TNFα/IFNγ, respectively. Anti-CXCR5 antibody treatment without stimulating agents did not affect Arg-1 and COX-2 expression; this suggests that CXCR5 may have a regulatory role in microglia cells activation. These results indicate that with age, CXCR5 mice develop RD characterized by microglia dysfunction, increased production of CXCL13 in the RPE progressive photoreceptor, neuronal loss, and sub-RPE deposition of cellular debris, resulting in the production of immunogenic proteins and autoimmune-mediated RD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559425>Drug Abuse-Related Neuroinflammation in Human Postmortem Brains: An Immunohistochemical Approach.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to investigate blood-brain  alterations, neuroinflammation, and glial responses in drug abusers. Five immunohistochemical markers (CD3, zonula occludens-1 [ZO-1], intracellular adhesion molecule 1 [ICAM-1], vascular cell adhesion molecule [VCAM-1], and glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) were assessed on postmortem brain samples collected from drug abusers who died from acute intoxication of cocaine, heroin, or a combination of both, compared with controls. CD3 and ICAM-1 immunopositivity were significantly stronger in drug abusers than in controls. VCAM-1 immunopositivity was similar across drug abuser and control groups. In heroin abusers, significantly lower ZO-1 immunopositivity was observed relative to controls. GFAP positivity did not show significant differences between groups, but its distribution within the brain did differ. Both cocaine and heroin abuse promoted neuroinflammation, increasing expression of ICAM-1 and recruiting CD3+ lymphocytes. Heroin affected the molecular  of tight junctions, as reflected by reduced ZO-1 expression. The outcomes of the present study are, overall, consistent with prior available evidence, which is almost exclusively from studies conducted in vitro or in animal models. These findings provide important information about the downstream consequences of neuroinflammation in drug abusers and may help to inform the development of potential therapeutic targets.© 2019 American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.

Probe-based confocal endomicroscopy was performed using intravenous fluorescein to assess the paracellular fluorescein leakage and cell shedding. Mast cells were identified with quantitative immunohistochemistry on mucosal biopsies.Endomicroscopic score of paracellular permeability was significantly higher in H pylori-negative FD patients compared with healthy controls (1.45 ± 1.27 vs 3.69 ± 3.18, P = .006). However, FD patients and healthy controls did not show differences in cell shedding score (0.75 ± 0.79 vs 1.29 ± 1.14, P = .069). Mast cell numbers were significantly increased compared with healthy control samples (18.91 ± 5.47 vs 14.1 ± 3.88, P < .001).

The basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) has been implicated in intestinal epithelial fluid secretion. Two patients with deleterious heterozygous (NKCC1-DFX) or homozygous (Kilquist) mutations in SLC12A2 (NKCC1) suffer from gastrointestinal deficits. Due to chronic infections, the colon and the small intestine of the NKCC1-DFX patient were surgically resected.To investigate how NKCC1 affects the  and function of the gut epithelia, we used a mouse model recapitulating the NKCC1-DFX patient mutation. Electron microscopy and immunostaining were used to analyze the  of the colonic mucus layers and immune cells infiltration. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on the distal colon sections to measure bacteria translocation to the mucosa and submucosa. Citrobacter rodentium was used to measure mouse ability to clear enteric infection. Multiplex cytokine assay was used to analyze mouse inflammatory response to infection.We show that NKCC1-DFX expression causes defective goblet cells mucus granule exocytosis, leading to secretion of intact granules into the lumen of the large intestine. In addition, NKCC1-DFX colon submucosal glands secrete mucus that remained attached to the epithelium. Importantly, expression of the mutant NKCC1 or complete loss of NKCC1 function leads to aggravated inflammatory response to Citrobacter rodentium infection. Compared to wild-type, NKCC1-DFX mice showed decreased expression of claudin-2, a tight junction protein involved in paracellular Na and water transport and enteric infection clearance.Our data indicate that NKCC1-DFX impairs gut  function by affecting mucus secretion and immune properties.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

MicroRNAs (miRs) can regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Hypoxia selectively disrupts endothelial tight junction complexes through a hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)-dependent mechanism. Though increased HIF-1α expression is associated with adaptation and protection from AMS development in the early stage of hypoxia, a downstream effector of HIF-1α, VEGF, can induce overzealous endothelial  dysfunction, increase vascular permeability, and ultimately result in HAPE and high-altitude cerebral edema. We hypothesized that the fine-tuning of downstream effectors by miRs is paramount for the preservation of endothelial   and the prevention of vascular leakage. We found that several miRs were up-regulated in healthy volunteers who were subjected to a 3100-m height. By reviewing the literature and using online bioinformatics prediction software, we specifically selected miR-424 for further investigation because it can modulate both HIF-1α and VEGF. Hypoxia-induced miR-424 overexpression is HIF-1α dependent, and miR-424 stabilized HIF-1α, decreased VEGF expression, and promoted vascular endothelial cadherin phosphorylation. In addition, hypoxia resulted in endothelial  dysfunction with increased permeability; miR-424 thus attenuated hypoxia-induced endothelial cell senescence and apoptosis. miR-322 knockout mice were susceptible to hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular leakage. miR-322 mimics improved hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular leakage . We conclude that several miRs were up-regulated in healthy adult volunteers subjected to hypobaric hypoxemia. miR-424/322 could modulate the HIF-1α-VEGF axis and prevent hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular leakage under hypoxic conditions.-Tsai, S.-H., Huang, P.-H., Tsai, H.-Y., Hsu, Y.-J., Chen, Y.-W., Wang, J.-C., Chen, Y.-H., Lin, S.-J.

(Myrtaceae) has been traditionally used in treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders including diarrhoea and have also been reported for its potent antidiarrhoeal activity on various chemical induced diarrhoea models. The objective of our present study was to evaluate the potency of the leaf extract of the plant Psidium guajava (PGE) along with its major biomarker quercetin against Shigella flexneri-induced sub chronic model of infectious diarrhoea. PGE at 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o. and quercetin at 50 mg/kg, p.o. were administered to Shigella flexneri-induced diarrhoeal rats for five days and various behavioural parameters were evaluated on 1st, 3rd and 5th day of treatment. This was followed by assessment of stool water content, density of Shigella flexneri in stools and blood parameters examination. After treatment, colon and small intestine of rats was dissected and subjected to biochemical estimations, cytokine profiling, antioxidant evaluations, ion concentration determination, Na/K-ATPase activity and histopathology. Molecular docking studies on crystal structure of Secreted Extracellular Protein A (SepA) from Shigella flexneri with biomarker quercetin was also performed. PGE at 200 mg/kg followed by quercetin depicted maximum antidiarrhoeal potential, which was confirmed through diarrhoea score and % protection, while PGE at 400 mg/kg showed similar effect to PGE 200 mg/kg thus, the later may have ceiling effect. PGE and quercetin also significantly reduced the density of Shigella flexneri in stools, water content of stools and restored the alterations observed in blood parameters, antioxidant status and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) expression. These parameters contributed in normalization of electrolyte balance, reactivation of Na/K-ATPase activity and repairing of epithelial tissue damage, confirmed through histopathology. Docking simulation studies revealed the role of quercetin in inactivating the protease activity of SepA, a protein secreted by Shigella, which disrupts epithelial   during infection and also manages its signal production. Thus, the overall results confirmed the role of quercetin as a major biomarker for the observed antidiarrhoeal potential of P. guajava against Shigella flexneri induced infectious diarrhoea.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

At the cellular level, these tumours are composed of a mixture of neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic cells, including tumour-associated macrophages and endothelial cells. Cerebral oedema is a near-universal occurrence in patients afflicted with glioblastoma and it is almost exclusively managed with the corticosteroid dexamethasone despite significant drawbacks associated with its use. Here, we demonstrate that dexamethasone blocks interleukin-1 production in both bone marrow-derived and brain resident macrophage populations following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and interferon gamma. Additionally, dexamethasone is shown to inhibit downstream effectors of interleukin-1 signalling in both macrophage populations. Co-culture of bone marrow-derived macrophages with organotypic tumour slices results in an upregulation of interleukin-1 cytokines, an effect that is absent in co-cultured microglia. Genetic ablation of interleukin-1 ligands or receptor in mice bearing RCAS/tv-a-induced platelet-derived growth factor B-overexpressing glioblastoma results in reduced oedema and partial restoration of the  of the blood-brain , respectively; similar to results obtained with vascular endothelial growth factor neutralization. We establish that tumours from dexamethasone-treated mice exhibit reduced infiltration of cells of the myeloid and lymphoid compartments, an effect that should be considered during clinical trials for immunotherapy in glioblastoma patients. Additionally, we emphasize that caution should be used when immune profiling and single-cell RNA sequencing data are interpreted from fresh glioblastoma patient samples, as nearly all patients receive dexamethasone after diagnosis. Collectively, this evidence suggests that interleukin-1 signalling inhibition and dexamethasone treatment share therapeutic efficacies and establishes interleukin-1 signalling as an attractive and specific therapeutic target for the management of glioblastoma-associated cerebral oedema.© The Author(s) (2019).

Exquisite temporospatial control of the GREM1-BMP interaction is required during development, and perturbation of this balance leads to abnormal limb formation and defective kidney development. In addition to inhibition of BMP signaling, several other noncanonical signaling modalities of GREM1 have been postulated. Some literature reports have suggested that GREM1 can bind to and activate vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) in endothelial cells, human kidney epithelial cells, and others. These reports suggest that the GREM1àVEGFR2 signaling can drive angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. We report here that, despite exhaustive attempts, we did not observe GREM1 activation of VEGFR2 in any of the cell lines reported by the above-mentioned studies. Incubation of endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with recombinant VEGF triggered a robust increase in VEGFR2 tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, no VEGFR2 phosphorylation was detected when cells were incubated with recombinant GREM1 over a range of time points and concentrations. We also show that GREM1 does not interfere with VEGF-mediated VEGFR2 activation, suggesting that GREM1 does not bind with any great affinity to VEGFR2. Measurements of ECFC   revealed that VEGF induces  function disruption, but recombinant human GREM1 had no effect in this assay.

Given the role of endothelial cells in the BBB, we hypothesized that the endothelial-specific expression of the recently described longevity gene SIRT6 may exhibit protective properties in stroke.SIRT6 endothelial expression was reduced following stroke. Endothelial-specific Sirt6 knockout (eSirt6-/-) mice, as well as animals in which Sirt6 overexpression was post-ischaemically induced, underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). eSirt6-/- animals displayed increased infarct volumes, mortality, and neurological deficit after tMCAO, as compared to control littermates. Conversely, post-ischaemic Sirt6 overexpression decreased infarct size and neurological deficit. Analysis of ischaemic brain sections revealed increased BBB damage and endothelial expression of cleaved caspase-3 in eSIRT6-/- mice as compared to controls. In primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMVECs), hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) reduced SIRT6 expression and SIRT6 silencing impaired the  function (transendothelial resistance) similar to what was observed in mice exposed to I/R. Further, SIRT6-silenced HBMVECs exposed to H/R showed reduced viability, increased cleaved caspase-3 expression and reduced activation of the survival pathway Akt. In ischaemic stroke patients, SIRT6 expression was higher in those with short-term neurological improvement as assessed by NIHSS scale and correlated with stroke outcome.Endothelial SIRT6 exerts a protective role in ischaemic stroke by blunting I/R-mediated BBB damage and thus, it may represent an interesting novel therapeutic target to be explored in future clinical investigation.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

CSF sPDGFRβ did not correlate with Aβ42. Serum and CSF sPDGFRβ were positively correlated (r = 0.547, p = 0.0085) in the independent neurologically normal CSF/serum matched samples.We provide further evidence of an association between pericyte injury and BBB breakdown in AD and novel evidence that a CSF marker of pericyte injury is related to the severity of AD pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559977>Clostridium tyrobutyricum alleviates Staphylococcus aureus-induced endometritis in mice by inhibiting endometrial  disruption and inflammatory response.</a></h2><p>Endometritis is an inflammatory disease of the uterus caused by bacterial infection, and it affects both human and animal health. This study aims to investigate the protective effects and molecular mechanisms of probiotics such as Clostridium tyrobutyricum (C. tyrobutyricum) on Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)-induced endometritis. The results showed that S. aureus infection significantly induced the pathological damage of the uterus, increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β, and attenuated the expression of tight junction proteins of uterine tissues. However, C. tyrobutyricum pretreatment obviously reduced the inflammatory response and reversed the changes of tight junction proteins of the uterus induced by S. aureus. Together, the data showed that C. tyrobutyricum also inhibited the expression of the TLR2/NF-κB signaling pathway and HDAC induced by S. aureus. In addition, the treatment of mice with live C. tyrobutyricum, spent culture supernatants (SCS) from C. tyrobutyricum, rather than inactive C. tyrobutyricum, inhibited the inflammatory response induced by S. aureus. Through further research, we found that the levels of butyrate in both blood and uterine tissues of mice treated with C. tyrobutyricum were significantly increased. These findings underscore the protective effect of C. tyrobutyricum on endometritis by enhancing the uterus   and inhibiting the inflammatory response. The anti-inflammatory mechanism may occur through the regulation of the expression of TLR2/NF-κB and HDAC, and C. tyrobutyricum can be a potentially therapeutic candidate for the treatment of endometritis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518490>Colonic mast cell numbers, symptom profile, and mucosal expression of elements of the epithelial  in irritable bowel syndrome.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to determine whether patients with IBS displayed altered mucosal mast cell (MC) numbers and proportions of MCs co-localizing with nerves compared with healthy subjects (HS) and whether these MC characteristics correlated with IBS symptoms, elements of the epithelial , or visceral sensitivity.Mucosal MC characteristics were determined using immunoassay. IBS symptoms, gene expression of elements of the epithelial , fecal serine protease activity, and visceral sensitivity were assessed.The MC numbers per mm were 2.0 (0.0-6.0) in patients with IBS (n = 43) and 3.5 (1.1-9.1) in HS (n = 20, P = .26). Of these, MCs were 0.0 (0.0-20) % vs 3.1 (0.0-18) % (P = .76) in IBS and HS, respectively, in co-localization with nerve fibers. MC characteristics were equivalent in the different IBS subtypes. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified two distinct groups among patients with IBS: MC high (higher MC numbers and proportions of MCs co-localizing with nerves) and MC low (lower MC numbers and proportions of MCs co-localizing with nerves). The MC high and MC low groups could not be discriminated with regard to IBS symptoms, parameters of visceral sensitivity, gene expression of elements of the epithelial , and fecal protease activity.There was no evidence of increased infiltration or altered localization of MCs in the colonic mucosa of patients with IBS. These MC characteristics were not linked to global IBS symptoms or mucosal expression of elements of the epithelial .

Children experiencing gastroesophageal and extraesophageal reflux are often prescribed proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to reduce gastric acid associated damage to esophageal and airway mucosa. The potential of pepsin and gastric fluid, from children that were either on or off PPI therapy, to cause inflammation and damage using a human in vitro co-culture model of the airway mucosa was evaluated herein. Exposure of the airway model to acidic solutions caused cellular damage and loss of viability, however, acid alone did not disrupt   or instigate neutrophil trans-epithelial migration without pepsin. Gastric fluid from patients on PPI therapy exhibited only a slightly higher pH yet had significantly higher concentrations of pepsin and elicited more  disruption and neutrophil trans-epithelial migration compared to gastric fluid from patients off PPIs. Inflammatory and damaging responses observed with gastric fluid from patients on PPIs were largely driven by pepsin. These results indicate the potential for PPI usage to raise concentrations of pepsin in gastric fluid, which may enhance the pathological impact of micro-aspirations in children with extraesophageal reflux.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636306>PKM2 regulates endothelial cell junction dynamics and angiogenesis via ATP production.</a></h2><p>Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, occurs in pathophysiological contexts such as wound healing, cancer, and chronic inflammatory disease. During sprouting angiogenesis, endothelial tip and stalk cells coordinately remodel their cell-cell junctions to allow collective migration and extension of the sprout while maintaining  . All these processes require energy, and the predominant ATP generation route in endothelial cells is glycolysis. However, it remains unclear how ATP reaches the plasma membrane and intercellular junctions. In this study, we demonstrate that the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase 2 (PKM2) is required for sprouting angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo through the regulation of endothelial cell-junction dynamics and collective migration. We show that PKM2-silencing decreases ATP required for proper VE-cadherin internalization/traffic at endothelial cell-cell junctions. Our study provides fresh insight into the role of ATP subcellular compartmentalization in endothelial cells during angiogenesis. Since manipulation of EC glycolysis constitutes a potential therapeutic intervention route, particularly in tumors and chronic inflammatory disease, these findings may help to refine the targeting of endothelial glycolytic activity in disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531162>Comparison of Irritancy Potential of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate-free Aqueous Cream to Other Moisturizers: An Intraindividual Skin Occlusive Study.</a></h2><p> We compared the irritancy potential of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)-free aqueous cream to SLS-containing aqueous cream and other moisturizers.  This was a double-blind, intraindividual occlusive study. SLS-containing aqueous cream; SLS-free aqueous cream; white soft paraffin; urea cream; Physiogel® (Stiefel Laboratories, Brentford, United Kingdom); QV cream (Ego Pharmaceuticals Pty. Ltd., Braeside, Australia); Cetaphil RestoraDerm® (Galderma Laboratories, Fort Worth, Texas); Ceradan® (Hyphens Pharma International Ltd., Singapore); normal saline; and SLS 1% aqueous were applied with Finn chamber occlusion to different sites on each participant's back for 72 hours. Skin assessments were carried out on Day 0 preapplication and Day 3 and Day 7 postapplication.  Twelve healthy adult volunteers were included in this study.  Study subjects were clinically evaluated by an experienced dermatologist using a four-point severity scale to assess the severity of erythema, dryness, desquamation, stinging or burning, and pruritus. Corneometer® and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) readings were taken to assess skin hydration and skin  , respectively. All measurements were performed on Days 0, 3, and 7.  Application of the SLS-free aqueous cream resulted in no significant changes in TEWL or Corneometer® readings throughout the study period. The SLS-containing aqueous cream resulted in a significant increase in TEWL from Day 0 to Days 3 and 7. All test moisturizer creams showed no significant changes in their clinical assessment scores.  The results of our study indicate that SLS-free aqueous cream has a lower irritancy potential than SLS-containing aqueous cream, with the same level of maintenance of skin   and hydration. SLS-free aqueous cream also appears to be less irritating to the skin than other non-SLS generic and commercial moisturizers tested.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661909>Electrical Characteristics and Reliability of Nitrogen-Stuffed Porous Low-k SiOCH/MnON/Cu Integration.</a></h2><p>In our previous study, a novel  processing on a porous low-dielectric constant (low-k) film was developed: an ultrathin Mn oxide on a nitrogen-stuffed porous carbon-doped organosilica film (p-SiOCH(N)) as a  of the Cu film was fabricated. To form a better  MnON film, additional annealing at 450 °C was implemented. In this study, the electrical characteristics and reliability of this integrated Cu/MnON/p-SiOCH(N)/Si structure were investigated. The proposed Cu/MnON/p-SiOCH(N)/Si capacitors exhibited poor dielectric breakdown characteristics in the as-fabricated stage, although, less degradation was found after thermal stress. Moreover, its time-dependence-dielectric-breakdown electric-field acceleration factor slightly increased after thermal stress, leading to a larger dielectric lifetime in a low electric-field as compared to other metal-insulator-silicon (MIS) capacitors. Furthermore, its Cu  ability under electrical or thermal stress was improved. As a consequence, the proposed Cu/MnON/p-SiCOH(N) scheme is promising  for back-end-of-line interconnects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500368>Worm-Based Alternate Assessment of Probiotic Intervention against Gut  Infection.</a></h2><p>The epithelial  is the frontline defense against enteropathogenic bacteria and nutrition-linked xenobiotic stressors in the alimentary tract. In particular, enteropathogenic  (EPEC) insults the gut  and is increasingly implicated in chronic intestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.

In particular, EPEC infected the gut and shortened the lifespan of , which was counteracted by colonization of  strain Nissle 1917 (EcN). In addition to the competitive actions of EcN against EPEC, EcN improved the gut   of worms via the Zonula occludens ortholog (Zoo-1) induction, which was verified in the murine infection and colitis model.

We employed brain microvascular endothelial cells; to investigate the effects of P53 towards the lipid oxidation of the BBB. P53 reduction by LPS, siRNA for P53 and Pifithrin increased the expression levels of malondialdehyde, a marker of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, P53 suppression impaired the permeability of the BBB monolayers. In contrast, P53 induction by Nutlin and Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 enhanced the BBB function. In conclusion, P53 supports BBB , at least in part, by reducing lipid peroxidation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

SDR9C7 encodes a short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 9C member 7 (SDR9C7) recently found mutated in ichthyosis. In a patient with SDR9C7 mutation and a mouse Sdr9c7 knockout model we show loss of covalent binding of epidermal ceramides to protein, a structural fault in the . For reasons unresolved, protein binding requires lipoxygenase-catalyzed transformations of linoleic acid (18:2) esterified in ω-O-acylceramides. In Sdr9c7-/- epidermis, quantitative LC-MS assays revealed almost complete loss of a species of ω-O-acylceramide esterified with linoleate-9,10-trans-epoxy-11E-13-ketone; other acylceramides related to the lipoxygenase pathway were in higher abundance. Recombinant SDR9C7 catalyzed NAD+-dependent dehydrogenation of linoleate 9,10-trans-epoxy-11E-13-alcohol to the corresponding 13-ketone, while ichthyosis mutants were inactive. We propose, therefore, that the critical requirement for lipoxygenases and SDR9C7 is in producing acylceramide containing the 9,10-epoxy-11E-13-ketone, a reactive moiety known for its non-enzymatic coupling to protein. This suggests a mechanism for coupling of ceramide to protein and provides important insights into skin  formation and pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600673>Zwitterionic polymer/polydopamine coating reduce acute inflammatory tissue responses to neural implants.</a></h2><p>The inflammatory brain tissue response to implanted neural electrode devices has hindered the longevity of these implants. Zwitterionic polymers have a potent anti-fouling effect that decreases the foreign body response to subcutaneous implants. In this study, we developed a nanoscale anti-fouling coating composed of zwitterionic poly (sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSB) and polydopamine (PDA) for neural probes. The addition of PDA improved the stability of the coating compared to PSB alone, without compromising the anti-fouling properties of the film. PDA-PSB coating reduced protein adsorption by 89% compared to bare Si samples, while fibroblast adhesion was reduced by 86%. PDA-PSB coated silicon based neural probes were implanted into mouse brain, and the inflammatory tissue responses to the implants were assessed by immunohistochemistry one week after implantation. The PSB-PDA coated implants showed a significantly decreased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for reactive astrocytes, within 70 μm from the electrode-tissue interface (p < 0.05). Additionally, the coating reduced the microglia activation as shown in decreased Iba-1 and lectin staining, and improved blood-brain   indicated by reduced immunoglobulin (IgG) leakage into the tissue around the probes. These findings demonstrate that anti-fouling zwitterionic coating is effective in suppressing the acute inflammatory brain tissue response to implants, and should be further investigated for its potential to improve chronic performance of neural implants.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

While the core machinery is known, the molecular basis of the epigenetic regulation of autophagy and its role in colon inflammation remain largely undefined. Here, we report that BRG1, an ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is required for the homeostatic maintenance of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) to prevent the inflammation and tumorigenesis. BRG1 emerges as a key regulator that directly governs the transcription of Atg16l1, Ambra1, Atg7 and Wipi2, which are important for autophagosome biogenesis. Defective autophagy in BRG1-deficient IECs results in excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to the defects in  . Together, our results establish that BRG1 may represent an autophagy checkpoint that is pathogenetically linked to colitis and is therefore likely a potential therapeutic target for disease intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598519>Persistent Corneal Epithelial Defects: A Review Article.</a></h2><p>Persistent corneal epithelial defects (PEDs or PCEDs) result from the failure of rapid re-epithelialization and closure within 10-14 days after a corneal injury, even with standard supportive treatment. Disruptions in the protective epithelial and stromal layers of the cornea can render the eye susceptible to infection, stromal ulceration, perforation, scarring, and significant vision loss. Although several therapies exist and an increasing number of novel approaches are emerging, treatment of PEDs can still be quite challenging. It is important to treat the underlying causative condition, which may include an infection, limbal stem cell deficiency, or diabetes, in order to facilitate wound healing. Standard treatments, such as bandage contact lenses (BCLs) and artificial tears (ATs), aim to provide  protection to the epithelial layer. Recently-developed medical treatments can target the re-epithelialization process by facilitating access to growth factors and anti-inflammatory agents, and novel surgical techniques can provide re-innervation to the cornea. PEDs should be treated within 7-10 days to avoid secondary complications. These interventions, along with a step-wise approach to management, can be useful in patients with PEDs that are refractory to standard medical treatment. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, current and novel management, and prognosis of persistent epithelial defects.© 2019, Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31473221>The impact of substance abuse on HIV-mediated neuropathogenesis in the current ART era.</a></h2><p>Approximately 37 million people worldwide are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). One highly significant complication of HIV infection is the development of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in 15-55% of people living with HIV (PLWH), that persists even in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) era. The entry of HIV into the central nervous system (CNS) occurs within 4-8 days after peripheral infection. This establishes viral reservoirs that may persist even in the presence of ART. Once in the CNS, HIV infects resident macrophages, microglia, and at low levels, astrocytes. In response to chronic infection and cell activation within the CNS, viral proteins, inflammatory mediators, and host and viral neurotoxic factors produced over extended periods of time result in neuronal injury and loss, cognitive deficits and HAND. Substance abuse is a common comorbidity in PLWH and has been shown to increase neuroinflammation and cognitive disorders. Additionally, it has been associated with poor ART adherence, and increased viral load in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), that may also contribute to increased neuroinflammation and neuronal injury. Studies have examined mechanisms that contribute to neuroinflammation and neuronal damage in PLWH, and how substances of abuse exacerbate these effects. This review will focus on how substances of abuse, with an emphasis on methamphetamine (meth), cocaine, and opioids, impact blood brain  (BBB)  and transmigration of HIV-infected and uninfected monocytes across the BBB, as well as their effects on monocytes/macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes within the CNS. We will also address how these substances of abuse may contribute to HIV-mediated neuropathogenesis in the context of suppressive ART. Additionally, we will review the effects of extracellular dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is increased in the CNS by substances of abuse, on HIV neuropathogenesis and how this may contribute to neuroinflammation, neuronal insult, and HAND in PLWH with active substance use. Lastly, we will discuss some potential therapies to limit CNS inflammation and damage in HIV-infected substance abusers.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Despite a strong influence of the intestinal microbiota on AD, the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and AD pathophysiology is still elusive.Using a recently developed AD-like pathology with amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles (ADLP) transgenic mouse model of AD, which shows amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and reactive gliosis in their brains along with memory deficits, we examined the impact of the gut microbiota on AD pathogenesis.Composition of the gut microbiota in ADLP mice differed from that of healthy wild-type (WT) mice. Besides, ADLP mice showed a loss of epithelial   and chronic intestinal and systemic inflammation. Both frequent transfer and transplantation of the faecal microbiota from WT mice into ADLP mice ameliorated the formation of amyloid β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, glial reactivity and cognitive impairment. Additionally, the faecal microbiota transfer reversed abnormalities in the colonic expression of genes related to intestinal macrophage activity and the circulating blood inflammatory monocytes in the ADLP recipient mice.These results indicate that microbiota-mediated intestinal and systemic immune aberrations contribute to the pathogenesis of AD in ADLP mice, providing new insights into the relationship between the gut (colonic gene expression, gut permeability), blood (blood immune cell population) and brain (pathology) axis and AD (memory deficits). Thus, restoring gut microbial homeostasis may have beneficial effects on AD treatment.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

Bradykinin 1 receptor (B1R) activation has been implicated in many neuroinflammatory diseases, but the contribution of B1R to inflammation and vascular breakdown is yet to be determined. As a result, the present study evaluated the effect of B1R stimulation using Des-Arg-9-BK on the cytokine profile and junctional properties of human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMVECs). Results showed that stimulation of B1R receptors increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), but decreased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a cytokine and growth factor required for maintenance of the vasculature. B1R stimulation also resulted in the loss of occludin expression at tight junctions with no change in VE-cadherin expression. There was also a significant increase in permeability to Evans blue albumin, suggesting an increase of vascular permeability. Taken together, these results suggest that B1R activation that occurs in neuroinflammatory diseases may contribute to both the inflammation and loss of blood-brain   that is characteristic of these diseases.© 2019 International Federation for Cell Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611757>Senescent HUVECs-secreted exosomes trigger endothelial  dysfunction in young endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Accumulation of senescent endothelial cells can cause endothelium dysfunction which eventually leads to age-related vascular disorders. The senescent-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) cells secrete a plethora of soluble factors that negatively influence the surrounding tissue microenvironment. The present study sought to investigate the effects of exosomes, which are nano-sized extracellular vesicles known for intercellular communications secreted by SASP cells on young endothelial cells.

The purified exosomes were used to treat young HUVECs. Exposure to exosomes repressed the expression of adherens junction proteins including vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and beta-catenin, decreased cell growth kinetics and impaired endothelial migration potential of young endothelial cells.

Upregulating angiopoietin-1 may therefore have therapeutic benefit for ischaemic stroke. This systematic review assessed whether upregulating angiopoietin-1 improved outcomes in rodent models of ischaemic stroke. Random-effects models quantified the effect of angiopoietin-1 upregulation on stroke severity in terms of the size of cerebral infarction and the extent of blood-brain  permeability. Eleven studies utilising rat and mouse models of ischaemic stroke fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses demonstrated that angiopoietin-1 upregulation significantly reduced cerebral infarction size (standardised mean difference: -3.02; 95% confidence intervals: -4.41, -1.63;  < 0.001;  = 171 animals) and improved blood-brain   (standardized mean difference: -2.02; 95% confidence intervals: -3.27, -0.77;  = 0.002;  = 129 animals). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that angiopoietin-1 upregulation improved outcomes in models of transient, not permanent cerebral ischaemia. Six studies assessed the effect of angiopoietin-1 upregulation on neurological function; however, inter-study heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis. In conclusion, published rodent data suggest that angiopoietin-1 upregulation improves outcome following temporary cerebral ischaemia by reducing cerebral infarction size and improving blood-brain  . Additional research is required to examine the effect of angiopoietin-1 upregulation on neurological function during stroke recovery and investigate the benefit and risks in patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669413>Palmitoyl acyltransferase activity of ZDHHC13 regulates skin  development partly by controlling PADi3 and TGM1 protein stability.</a></h2><p>Deficiency of the palmitoyl-acyl transferase ZDHHC13 compromises skin  permeability and renders mice susceptible to environmental bacterial infection and inflammatory dermatitis. It had been unclear how lack of ZDHHC13 proteins resulted in cutaneous abnormalities. In this study, we first demonstrate that enzymatic palmitoylation activity, rather than protein scaffolding, by ZDHHC13 is essential for skin  , showing that knock-in mice bearing an enzymatically dead DQ-to-AA ZDHHC13 mutation cyclically lost their hair after weaning, recapitulating knock-out phenotypes of skin inflammation and dermatitis. To establish the ZDHHC13 substrates responsible for skin  development, we employed quantitative proteomic approaches to identify protein molecules whose palmitoylation is tightly controlled by ZDHHC13. We identified over 300 candidate proteins that could be classified into four biological categories: immunological disease, skin development and function, dermatological disease, and lipid metabolism. Palmitoylation of three of these candidates-loricrin, peptidyl arginine deiminase type III and keratin fiber crosslinker transglutaminase 1-by ZDHHC13 was confirmed by biochemical assay. Palmitoylation was critical for in vivo protein stability of the latter two candidates. Our findings reveal the importance of protein palmitoylation in skin  development, partly by promoting envelope protein crosslinking and the filaggrin processing pathway.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The brain microenvironment can thwart the effectiveness of drugs against primary brain tumours as well as brain metastases.

Tumours are known to compromise the  of the BBB, resulting in a vasculature known as the blood-tumour  (BTB), which is highly heterogeneous and characterized by numerous distinct features, including non-uniform permeability and active efflux of molecules. We discuss the challenges posed by the BBB and BTB for drug delivery, how multiple cell types dictate BBB function and the role of the BTB in disease progression and treatment. Finally, we highlight emerging molecular, cellular and physical strategies to improve drug delivery across the BBB and BTB and discuss their impact on improving conventional as well as emerging treatments, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and engineered T cells. A deeper understanding of the BBB and BTB through the application of single-cell sequencing and imaging techniques, and the development of biomarkers of BBB  along with systems biology approaches, should enable new personalized treatment strategies for primary brain malignancies and brain metastases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662022>Localization of Tricellular Tight Junction Molecule LSR at Midbody and Centrosome During Cytokinesis in Human Epithelial Cells.</a></h2><p>Epithelial  and  function are maintained during cytokinesis in vertebrate epithelial tissues. The changes in localization and the roles of tricellular tight junction molecule lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) during cytokinesis are not well known, although new tricellular tight junctions form at the flank of the midbody during cytokinesis. In this study, we investigated the changes in localization and the role of LSR at the midbody and centrosome during cytokinesis using human endometrial carcinoma cell line Sawano, comparing the tricellular tight junction molecule tricellulin; bicellular tight junction molecules occludin, claudin-7, zonula occludens-1, and cingulin; and the epithelial polarized related molecules apoptosis-stimulating of p53 protein 2, PAR3, and yes-associated protein. During cytokinesis induced by treatment with taxol, the epithelial  was maintained and the tricellular tight junction molecules LSR and tricellulin were concentrated at the flank of the acetylated tubulin-positive midbody and in γ-tubulin-positive centrosomes with the dynein adaptor Hook2, whereas the other molecules were localized there as well. All the molecules disappeared by knockdown using small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, by the knockdown of Hook2, the epithelial  was maintained and most of the molecules disappeared from the centrosome. These findings suggest that LSR may play crucial roles not only in  function but also in cytokinesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636329>Mitochondrial dysfunction increases pro-inflammatory cytokine production and impairs repair and corticosteroid responsiveness in lung epithelium.</a></h2><p>COPD is characterized by chronic lung inflammation and irreversible lung tissue damage. Inhaled noxious gases, including cigarette smoke, are the major risk factor for COPD. Inhaled smoke first encounters the epithelial lining of the lungs, causing oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. We investigated whether a mitochondrial defect may contribute to increased lung epithelial pro-inflammatory responses, impaired epithelial repair and reduced corticosteroid sensitivity as observed in COPD. We used wild-type alveolar epithelial cells A549 and mitochondrial DNA-depleted A549 cells (A549 Rho-0) and studied pro-inflammatory responses using (multiplex) ELISA as well as epithelial  function and repair (real-time impedance measurements), in the presence and absence of the inhaled corticosteroid budesonide. We observed that A549 Rho-0 cells secrete higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines than wild-type A549 cells and display impaired repair upon wounding. Budesonide strongly suppressed the production of neutrophil attractant CXCL8, and promoted epithelial  in A549 wild-type cells, while A549 Rho-0 cells displayed reduced corticosteroid sensitivity compared to wild-type cells. The reduced corticosteroid responsiveness may be mediated by glycolytic reprogramming, specifically glycolysis-associated PI3K signaling, as PI3K inhibitor LY294002 restored the sensitivity of CXCL8 secretion to corticosteroids in A549 Rho-0 cells. In conclusion, mitochondrial defects may lead to increased lung epithelial pro-inflammatory responses, reduced epithelial repair and reduced corticosteroid responsiveness in lung epithelium, thus potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of COPD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483106>Using Evans Blue Dye to Determine Blood-Brain   in Rodents.</a></h2><p>The blood-brain  (BBB) is an active and selective  that shields the brain from endogenous and exogenous insults. Different stimuli may lead to the disruption of this , including inflammation and trauma. Several methods are used to evaluate BBB disruption. The most widely used method is Evans blue (EB) dye extravasation. EB cannot normally pass through the BBB and thus its presence in brain tissue indicates alterations in permeability. This protocol details the steps of EB extravasation in rodents. Important aspects regarding critical steps and advantages are also provided.© 2019 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641228>Polydatin protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced endothelial  disruption via SIRT3 activation.</a></h2><p>In a previous study, we demonstrated the role of polydatin (PD) in protecting against multiple organ dysfunction in sepsis. The aim of this study is to investigate whether PD protects against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endothelial  disruption through SIRT3 activation and to disclose the underlying mechanisms. Wild-type mice were injected with LPS and Evans Blue assay was performed to evaluate vascular permeability. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were stimulated with LPS. Endothelial permeability was evaluated by transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) and FITC-dextran leakage. SIRT3 activity was determined by a Deacetylase Fluorometric kit, and protein expression level of SIRT3 was detected by western blotting. Mitochondrial function was evaluated by determination of ROS level, mitochondrial membrane potential and mPTP opening. In endotoxemic mice, PD pretreatment attenuated vascular leakage in multiple organs while SIRT3 inhibition with 3-TYP reversed the effects of PD. PD treatment in late sepsis also exhibited  protective effects. In HUVECs, PD alleviated LPS-induced F-actin rearrangement, cadherin-catenin complex dissociation and endothelial hyperpermeability, whereas 3-TYP or SIRT3 siRNA attenuated the protective effects of PD. PD enhanced SIRT3 deacetylase activity, and attenuated LPS-induced decrease in SIRT3 expression as well. Furthermore, gain-of-function and loss-of-function strategies also confirmed the role of SIRT3 in enhancing endothelial  . It was further ascertained that PD enhanced SIRT3-mediated deacetylation of SOD2 and cyclophilin D (CypD), thus suppressing mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent endothelial  dysfunction. In addition, it was revealed that RAGE was involved in LPS-regulated SIRT3 signaling. Our results suggest that polydatin protects against LPS-induced endothelial  disruption dependent on SIRT3 and can be applied as a potential therapy for sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658751> and Probiotics Interactions from a Prolongevity Perspective.</a></h2><p>Probiotics exert beneficial effects on host health through different mechanisms of action, such as production of antimicrobial substances, competition with pathogens, enhancement of host mucosal   and immunomodulation. In the context of ageing, which is characterized by several physiological alterations leading to a low grade inflammatory status called inflammageing, evidences suggest a potential prolongevity role of probiotics. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying anti-ageing effects requires the use of simple model systems. To this respect, the nematode  represents a suitable model organism for the study of both host-microbe interactions and for ageing studies, because of conserved signaling pathways and host defense mechanisms involved in the regulation of its lifespan. Therefore, this review analyses the impact of probiotics on  age-related parameters, with particular emphasis on oxidative stress, immunity, inflammation and protection from pathogen infections. The picture emerging from our analysis highlights that several probiotic strains are able to exert anti-ageing effects in nematodes by acting on common molecular pathways, such as insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IIS) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). In this perspective,  appears to be advantageous for shedding light on key mechanisms involved in host prolongevity in response to probiotics supplementation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470514>Anti-Diabetic Countermeasures Against Tobacco Smoke-Dependent Cerebrovascular Toxicity: Use and Effect of Rosiglitazone.</a></h2><p>Tobacco smoking (TS) is one of the most addictive habit sand a main public health hazards, impacting the vascular endothelium through oxidative stress (OS) stimuli, exposure to nicotine, and smoking-induced inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. Increasing evidence also suggested that TS increases glucose intolerance and the risk factor of developing type-2 diabetes mellitus (2DM), which, along with TS, is connected to blood-brain  (BBB) injuries, and heightens the risk of cerebrovascular disorders. Although the exact mechanism of rosiglitazone (RSG) is unknown, our previous in vitro work showed how RSG, an oral anti-diabetic drug belonging to the family of thiazolidinedione class, can protect BBB  through enhancement of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) activity. Herein, we have validated the protective role of rosiglitazone against TS-induced BBB impairment in vivo. Our results revealed that RSG as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), activates counteractive mechanisms primarily associated with the upregulation of Nrf2 and PPARγ pathways which reduce TS-dependent toxicity at the cerebrovascular level. In line with these findings, our results show that RSG reduces inflammation and protects BBB . In conclusion, RSG offers a novel and promising therapeutic application to reduce TS-induced cerebrovascular dysfunction through activation of the PPARγ-dependent and/or PPARγ-independent Nrf2 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614770>The Effects and Mechanisms of Cyanidin-3-Glucoside and Its Phenolic Metabolites in Maintaining Intestinal .</a></h2><p>Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is a well-known natural anthocyanin and possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The catabolism of C3G in the gastrointestinal tract could produce bioactive phenolic metabolites, such as protocatechuic acid, phloroglucinaldehyde, vanillic acid, and ferulic acid, which enhance C3G bioavailability and contribute to both mucosal  and microbiota. To get an overview of the function and mechanisms of C3G and its phenolic metabolites, we review the accumulated data of the absorption and catabolism of C3G in the gastrointestine, and attempt to give crosstalk between the phenolic metabolites, gut microbiota, and mucosal innate immune signaling pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540372>Norvaline Restores the BBB  in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia. The disease progression is associated with the build-up of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. However, besides the well-defined lesions, the AD-related pathology includes neuroinflammation, compromised energy metabolism, and chronic oxidative stress. Likewise, the blood-brain  (BBB) dysfunction is suggested to be a cause and AD consequence. Accordingly, therapeutic targeting of the compromised BBB is a promising disease-modifying approach. We utilized a homozygous triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3×Tg-AD) to assess the effects of L-norvaline on BBB . We scrutinized the perivascular astrocytes and macrophages by measuring the immunopositive profiles in relation to the presence of β-amyloid and compare the results with those found in wild-type animals. Typically, 3×Tg-AD mice display astroglia cytoskeletal atrophy, associated with the deposition of β-amyloid in the endothelia, and declining nitric oxide synthase (NOS) levels. L-norvaline escalated NOS levels, then reduced rates of BBB permeability, amyloid angiopathy, microgliosis, and astrodegeneration, which suggests AD treatment agent efficacy. Moreover, results undergird the roles of astrodegeneration and microgliosis in AD-associated BBB dysfunction and progressive cognitive impairment. L-norvaline self-evidently interferes with AD pathogenesis and presents a potent remedy for angiopathies and neurodegenerative disorders intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467875>Alda-1 Prevents Pulmonary Epithelial  Dysfunction following Severe Hemorrhagic Shock through Clearance of Reactive Aldehydes.</a></h2><p>Severe hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation (HS/R) can lead to lung injury, resulting in respiratory insufficiency. We investigated whether treatment with Alda-1, an ALDH2 activator, decreased lung injury induced by severe HS/R in a rat model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups, hemorrhagic shock + placebo, hemorrhagic shock + Alda-1, and sham. All animals were heparinized, and then 50% of the total calculated blood volume was collected over 60 minutes. After 40 minutes of hemorrhagic shock, animals were reinfused with the shed blood over 40 minutes and then observed for an additional 2 hours. Concentrations of 4-HNE, TNF-, IL-6, and ALDH2 activity were detected; lung injury and lung wet-to-dry weight ratios were assessed. Expression of occludin and ZO-1 proteins in lung tissues was also determined. At 2 hours after resuscitation, lung injury was significantly reduced and the wet-to-dry weight ratio was notably decreased in the Alda-1 group compared with placebo (P<0.05). Alda-1 treatment also significantly increased the activity of ALDH2 and decreased the levels of toxic 4-HNE (P<0.05). In the Alda-1 group, IL-6 and TNF- were dramatically decreased compared with placebo-treated animals (P<0.05). Expression of occludin and ZO-1 proteins was significantly decreased in the placebo group compared with the Alda-1 group (P<0.05). Thus, in a rat model of severe HS/R, treatment with Alda-1 increased the activity of ALDH2, significantly accelerated the clearance of reactive aldehydes, and concomitantly alleviated lung injury through improvement of pulmonary epithelial   resulting in decreased alveolar epithelial tissue permeability, lung edema, and diffuse infiltration of inflammatory cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483932>Erythropoietin protects outer blood-retinal  in experimental diabetic retinopathy by up-regulating ZO-1 and occludin.</a></h2><p>To explore the mechanisms of erythropoietin (EPO) in maintaining outer blood-retinal  (BRB) in diabetic rats.Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered diabetic with intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, and then followed by intravitreal injection of EPO. Two and four weeks later, the permeability of outer BRB was examined with FITC-dextran leakage assay, following a method to demarcate the inner and outer retina based on retinal blood supply. The glyoxal-treated ARPE-19 cells, incubated with EPO, soluble EPO receptor (sEPOR), Gö6976, or digoxin, were studied for cell viability and  function. The expressions of ZO-1, occludin, VEGFR2, HIF-1α, MAPKs, and AKT were examined with Western blot and immunofluorescence.The major Leakage of FITC-dextran was detected in the outer nuclear layer in both 2- and 4-week diabetic rats. The leakage was largely ameliorated in EPO-treated diabetic rats. The protein expressions of ZO-1 and occludin in the RPE-Bruch's membrane choriocapillaris complex were significantly decreased, whereas HIF-1α and JNK pathways were activated, in 4-week diabetic rats. These changes were prevented by EPO treatment. The in vitro study with ARPE-19 cells confirmed these changes, and the protective effect of EPO was abolished by sEPOR. Gö6976 and digoxin rescued the tight junction and  function in glyoxal-treated ARPE-19 cells.In early diabetic rats, the outer BRB might be more severely damaged and its breakdown is the major factor for retinal oedema. EPO maintains the outer BRB  through down-regulation of HIF-1α and JNK signallings, and thus up-regulating ZO-1 and occludin expressions in RPE cells.© 2019 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists.</p></html>
