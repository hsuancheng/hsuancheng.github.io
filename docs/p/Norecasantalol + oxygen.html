Synthetic wastewater having chemical  demand (COD) and biochemical  demand (BOD) of 400 ± 10% and 210 ± 10% mg/L respectively was fed and the reactor was subjected to OLRs ranging from 0.37 to 1.26 kg COD/m.d. It was observed that steady sloughing of biofilm occurs within the SAFF reactor all the times and average concentration of sloughed biomass in the effluent was 26 mg/L. The COD and BOD removal efficiencies varied between 85 and 89% and 86 to 94%, respectively. The kinetic studies demonstrated that SAFF reactor followed Stover-Kincannon and Grau models, with high correlation coefficients (R) of 0.9977 and 0.9916, respectively. Thus, the values of kinetic coefficients such as maximum substrate utilization rate, U = 64.1 g/(Ld); saturation value constant, K = 72.31 g/(L.d) and Grau second-order substrate removal rate constant, Ks = 2.44 day can be useful to develop and design large scale SAFF reactors. Finally, the study reveals that the optimum range for OLR can vary within 0.68-0.94 kg COD/m.d.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661484>[Pooled Human Immunoglobulin Preparations as Immunomodulating Drugs].</a></h2><p>It is time to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the first successful attempt to develop and use a specific high-titer antitoxic serum for treating diphtheria, a deadly infectious disease. This was followed by major advances in passive immunotherapy 75 years ago (production of pooled human IgG for subcutaneous injection) and 50 years ago (widespread technology for producing immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration). More than 200 tons of pooled human IgG are produced per year worldwide. The preparation is used primarily for IgG substitution in patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, as well as for an immunomodulating treatment of a growing number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. These preparations contain the pooled IgG antibody repertoire of a large population of healthy plasma donors. This repertoire includes antibodies that neutralize pathogens and their factors of virulence, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and antibodies to other foreign and own proteins, as well as to carbohydrate antigens. Naturally polyspecific antibodies that are present in all healthy individuals play an important role as a first-line defense against bacteria and viruses. After exposure to protein-modifying agents, some IgG molecules can acquire the ability to bind novel structurally unrelated antigens. This phenomenon is referred to as induced polyspecificity. The list of these protein-modifying molecules was shown to include low-pH buffers, free heme, pro-oxidative ferrous ions, reactive  species, etc. Such modified antibody preparations may have a therapeutic potential, since their administration to animals with experimental sepsis or aseptic systemic response syndromes significantly improved survival rates, while the same dose of the native preparation had no effect. We also hypothesize that the aggressive protein-modifying molecules released in sites of inflammation and tissue damage could also modify the antigen-binding behavior of surface immunoglobulin B cell receptors and the structurally related T cell receptors. This "specificity editing" of both types of receptors may play a major role in the body's defense mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657888>Pharmacologic and Nonpharmacologic Therapies in Adult Patients With Exacerbation of COPD: A Systematic Review [Internet].</a></h2><p>To synthesize existing knowledge about the effectiveness and harms of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ECOPD).Embase, Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Registrar of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from database inception to January 2, 2019.We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated pharmacologic intervention or nonpharmacologic interventions for ECOPD. The strength of evidence (SOE) was graded for critical final health outcomes.We included 98 RCTs (13,401 patients, mean treatment duration 9.9 days, mean followup 3.7 months). Final health outcomes, including mortality, resolution of exacerbation, hospital readmissions, repeat exacerbations, and need for intubation, were infrequently evaluated and often showed no statistically significant differences between groups. Antibiotic therapy increases the clinical cure rate and reduces the clinical failure rate regardless of the severity of ECOPD (moderate SOE). There is insufficient evidence to support a particular antibiotic regimen. Oral and intravenous corticosteroids improve dyspnea and reduce the clinical failure rate (low SOE). Despite the ubiquitous use of inhaled bronchodilators in ECOPD, we found only a small number of trials that assessed lung function tests, and not final health outcomes. The evidence is insufficient to support the effect of aminophyllines, magnesium sulfate, mucolytics, inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled antibiotics, 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, and statins on final health outcomes. Titrated  reduces mortality compared with high flow  (low SOE). Low SOE suggested benefit from some nonpharmacologic interventions such as chest physiotherapy using vibration/percussion/massage or breathing technique (on dyspnea), resistance training (on dyspnea and quality of life), early pulmonary rehabilitation commenced before hospital discharge during the initial most acute phase of exacerbation rather than the convalescence period (on dyspnea) and whole body vibration training (on quality of life). Vitamin D supplementation may improve quality of life (low SOE).Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a common condition, the evidence base for most interventions in ECOPD remains limited. Systemic antibiotics and corticosteroids are associated with improved outcomes in mild and moderate to severe ECOPD. Titrated  reduces mortality. Future research is required to assess the effectiveness of several emerging nonpharmacologic and dietary treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657650>A Kindred with a β-Globin Base Substitution [β89(F5)Ser→Arg (AG>AG); : c.270T>G] Resulting in Hemoglobin Vanderbilt.</a></h2><p>High  affinity hemoglobins (Hbs), characterized by a decreased ability to release  to the tissues and a left-shifted  dissociation curve, are a rare cause of secondary erythrocytosis.

We search for the equilibrium structures of phosphorene oxides, POx with various  concentrations x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1). By evaluating the formation energies with diverse configurations and their vibrational properties for each of various x values, we identify a series of stable oxidized structures with x and confirm that the oxidation occurs naturally. We also find that oxidation makes some modes from the P-O bonds and P-P bonds IR-active implying that the infrared spectra can be used to determine the degree of oxidation of phosphorene. Our electronic structure calculations reveal that the fully oxidized phosphorene (PO) has a direct band gap of 0.83 eV similar to the pristine phosphorene. Intriguingly, the PO possesses two nonsymmorphic symmetries with the inversion symmetry broken, guaranteeing symmetry-protected band structures including the band degeneracy and four-fold degenerate Dirac points. Our results provide an important guide in the search for the rare example of a Dirac semimetal with a higher level of degeneracy, giving significant insight into the relations between the symmetry of the lattice and band topology of electrons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661888>The Influence of the Degradation of Tetracycline by Free Radicals from Riboflavin-5'-Phosphate Photolysis on Microbial Viability.</a></h2><p>Tetracycline (TC) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic compound. Wastewater with TC may have an adverse effect on ecosystems. Riboflavin-5'-phosphate (FMN or flavin mononucleotide) is a non-toxic product of the phosphorylation of vitamin B and is required for the proper functioning of the humans. FMN is sensitized to ultraviolet (UV) and blue light radiation, as evidenced by the generation of reactive  species (ROS). This study inspects feasible applications of blue light on FMN so as to develop a valid way of degrading TC by FMN photolysis. We used the increased rate of bacterial survival as a practical indicator of antibiotic degradation. TC in the presence of FMN solution decomposed completely after 20 W/m of blue light irradiation (TCF treatment), and the degradation of TC (D-TCF) occurred after the photolytic process. After TCF treatment, colony-forming units (CFUs) of  ( were determined for the D-TCF solution. The CFU of  preservation was 93.2% of the D-TCF solution (50 μg/mL of TC in the presence of 114 μg/mL of FMN solution treated with 20 W/m of blue light irradiation at 25 °C for 1 h) cultivation. The mass spectrum of D-TCF showed diagnostic ion signals at m/z 431.0 and 414.0 Da. The molecular formula of D-TCF was CHNO, and the exact mass was 430.44 g/mol. TC degradation by FMN photolysis can significantly decrease the antimicrobial ability of TC. The results expressed here regarding the influence of FMN photolysis on TC degradation offer an environmentally sound wastewater treatment method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659867>Nanoparticle-Embedded Electrospun Fiber-Covered Stent to Assist Intraluminal Photodynamic Treatment of Oesophageal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Drug-eluting stents (DESs) are promising candidates for treating human oesophageal cancer. However, the use of DESs to assist photodynamic therapy (PDT) of orthotopic oesophageal tumors is not yet demonstrated to the best of current knowledge. Herein, through an electrospinning technology it is shown that -producing manganese dioxide nanoparticles are embedded into elelctrospun fibers, which are subsequently covered onto stents. Upon implantation, the nanoparticles are gradually released from the fibers and then diffuse into the nearby tumor tissue. Then, the hypoxic microenvironment can be effectively alleviated by reaction of MnO with the endogenous H O within the tumor. After demonstrating the excellent PDT efficacy of the stents in a conventional subcutaneous mouse tumor model, such stents are further used for PDT treatment in a rabbit orthotopic oesophageal cancer model by inserting an optical fiber into the tumor site. Greatly prolonged survival of rabbits is observed after such intraluminal PDT treatment. Taken together, this work shows that the fiber-covered stent as a nanoparticle delivery platform can enable effective PDT as a noninvasive treatment method for patients with advanced-stage oesophageal cancer.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Cerebral I/R results in excessive autophagy and neuronal demise. The present study was designed to explore the role of autophagy during ICS II-mediated neuroprotection on cerebral I/R in vivo and in vitro.The rat focal cerebral ischemia was induced 2 h of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion with ICS II, 3-MA or Rapamycin. The effect of ICS II was detemined using neurological behaviour and cerebral infarction. The expressions of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE 5), autophagy-related proteins and phosphorylation levels of GSK-3β were determined. Primary rat cortical neurons were subjected to  and glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) were applied to further elucidate the mechanism of ICS II on cerebral (I/R). A surface plasmon resonance assay and molecular docking were used to explore the interactions of ICS II with PDE 5 or GSK-3β.ICS II not only protected against MCAO-induced injury in rats, but also attenuated primary cortical neurons injury upon OGD/R. The neuroprotective effects of ICS II on cerebral I/R were attributed to mediating PKG/GSK-3β/autophagy axis. ICS II directly bound to PDE 5 and GSK-3β, and there also existed the interaction between PKG and GSK-3β.These findings indicate that ICS II attenuates cerebral I/R-induced injury via mediating PKG/GSK-3β/autophagy axis. This study will raise the possibility that ICS II may be exploited into a potent PDE 5 inhibitor against ischemia stroke.This article is protected by copyright.

The purpose of the study was to screen and identify bioactive compounds from BHD using live PC12 cells coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Using this approach, we successfully identified six bioactive components from BHD. These components have protective effects on -glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) injury to PC12 cells. Furthermore, calycosin-7-d-glucoside (CG) and formononetin-7-O--d-glucoside (FG) could upregulate the protein expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).

SIRT1 is a metabolic sensor of cellular energy and exerts essential functions on energy metabolism, oxidative stress response, apoptosis, or aging. Importantly, SIRT1 deacetylates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), the master regulator of energy metabolism involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid utilization. However, the exact role of SIRT1 in controlling cardiac energy metabolism is still incompletely understood and conflicting results have been obtained. We generated a cardio-specific inducible model of Sirt1 gene deletion in mice () to decipher the role of SIRT1 in control conditions and following cardiac stress induced by pressure overload. SIRT1 deficiency induced a progressive cardiac dysfunction, without overt alteration in mitochondrial content or properties. Sixteen weeks after  deletion an increase in mitochondrial reactive  species (ROS) production and a higher rate of oxidative damage were observed, suggesting disruption of the ROS production/detoxification balance. Following pressure overload, cardiac dysfunction and alteration in mitochondrial properties were exacerbated in  mice. Overall the results demonstrate that SIRT1 plays a cardioprotective role on cardiac energy metabolism and thereby on cardiac function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662993>Manganese-Doped Cerium Oxide Nanocomposite Induced Photodynamic Therapy in MCF-7 Cancer Cells and Antibacterial Activity.</a></h2><p>In this experimental approach, we explored the structures, morphologies, phototoxicities, and antibacterial activities of undoped and Mn-doped ceria nanocomposite materials, Mn  Ce O The Mn  Ce O nanocomposites were synthesized by employing a soft chemical route. Our prime focus was on the influence of different factors, both physical and chemical, i.e., the concentration of manganese in the product, size of the nanocomposite, drug dose, and incubation time, on the bacterial strains. Different bacterial strains were selected as experimental biological models of the antibacterial activity of the manganese-doped cerium oxide nanocomposite. In addition to the photodynamic response, the adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7) was also studied. Based on cell viability losses and bacterial inhibition analyses, the precise mechanisms of apoptosis or necrosis of 5-ALA/PpIX-exposed MCF-7 cells under 630 nm red lights and under dark conditions were elucidated. It was observed that the undoped nanocomposites had lower cytotoxicities and inhibitions compared with those of the doped nanocomposites towards pathogens. The antibacterial activity and effectiveness for photodynamic therapy were enhanced in the presence of the manganese-doped ceria nanocomposite, which could be attributed to the correlation of the maximum reactive  species generation for targeted toxicity and maximum antioxidant property in bacteria growth inhibition. The optimized cell viability dose and doping concentration will be beneficial for treating cancer and bacterial infections in the future.Copyright © 2019 M.

Thus, a pilot bioretention column experiment was performed to evaluate the nutrient control of systems with commercial activated carbon and river sediment-derived biochar. Significant chemical  demand (COD) and total phosphorus (TP) leaching were found with the addition of activated carbon and biochar, but total nitrogen (TN) leaching was significantly improved when activated carbon was used as the medium. During a semi-synthetic runoff experiment, the bioretention systems containing two types of fluvial biochar showed relatively better COD and TN control (average mass removal efficiencies and cumulative removal efficiencies) than commercial activated carbon. However, the average TP mass removal efficiency with commercial activated carbon (95% ± 3%) was significantly higher than biochar (48% ± 20% and 56 ± 14%). The addition of biochar in the media increased the nitrogen removal efficiency, and the addition of activated carbon significantly increased the phosphorous removal efficiency. Therefore, both biochar and activated carbon are effective materials for bioretention, and fluvial biochar provides an alternative approach to comprehensively utilize river sediment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649486> Field Emission of Carbon Nanotubes in  Using Environmental TEM and the Influence of the Imaging Electron Beam.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658548>[Clinical therapeutic observation on sequential treatment of chronic wounds with repeated recurrence of hidradenitis suppurativa in buttocks].</a></h2><p> To observe the clinical effects of sequential treatment with extensive lesion resection, vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid, and tissue transplantation on hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in buttocks which recurred after multiple surgeries.  From January 2012 to March 2017, 15 male patients (aged 26-53 years) hospitalized in our burn ward with Hurley's stage Ⅲ HS in the buttocks recurred after 2-5 operations who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the prospective self pre- and post-control study. After extensive resection of the lesion, continuous VSD combined with intermittent irrigation of -loaded fluid was given, with negative pressure of -16.7 kPa and flow rate of pure  of 1.0 L/min. After 7 days of treatment with VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid, the negative pressure device was removed and autologous posterior thigh split-thickness skin grafts and/or local flaps were transplanted to repair the wounds. Six patients were performed with split-thickness skin grafting, 4 patients with local flap transplantation, and 5 patients with split-thickness skin grafting together with local flap transplantation. The donor sites of local flaps were sutured directly or transplanted with autologous posterior thigh split-thickness skin grafts, and the donor sites of split-thickness skin grafts with autologous thin split-thickness scalp. The wound tissue or wound granulation tissue was collected before lesion resection and 7 days after treatment with VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid respectively for bacterial culture and detecting of the content of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Survival of skin grafts and flaps after operation was observed, hospitalization time was recorded, and recurrence and complications of HS were followed up. Data were processed with paired sample  test.  Bacterial culture result of wound tissue before lesion resection was positive in all patients, mainly  and anaerobic bacteria, etc., while that of wound granulation tissue after 7 days of treatment with VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid was negative. The content of TNF-α in wound granulation tissue after 7 days of treatment with VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid was (10.1±2.9) pg/L, significantly lower than (73.6±5.6) pg/L before lesion resection (=33.47, <0.01). The skin grafts and/or flaps of 15 patients survived post operation, and the wounds were healed. The patients were hospitalized for 17-31 days. During follow-up of 1 to 5 years, no recurrence of HS occurred in operative site of buttocks of 15 patients, but 1 patient had ulceration of healed perianal incision caused by high anal fistula and was healed after treatment.  Sequential treatment with extensive resection, VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid, and tissue transplantation can thoroughly remove HS lesions in the buttocks and improve the condition of wound bed for skin acceptance after debridement, which is conducive to the cure of HS in the buttocks which has undergone multiple operations but still recurs after operation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662429>Changes in the Composition of the Gut Microbiota and the Blood Transcriptome in Preterm Infants at Less than 29 Weeks Gestation Diagnosed with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia.</a></h2><p>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung condition in preterm infants that results in abnormal lung development and leads to considerable morbidity and mortality, making BPD one of the most common complications of preterm birth. We employed RNA sequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile gene expression in blood and the composition of the fecal microbiota in infants born at <29 weeks gestational age and diagnosed with BPD in comparison to those of preterm infants that were not diagnosed with BPD. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, performed longitudinally on 255 fecal samples collected from 50 infants in the first months of life, identified significant differences in the relative levels of abundance of , and  in the BPD infants in a manner that was birth mode dependent. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed that more than 400 genes were upregulated in infants with BPD. Genes upregulated in BPD infants were significantly enriched for functions related to red blood cell development and  transport, while several immune-related pathways were downregulated. We also identified a gene expression signature consistent with an enrichment of immunosuppressive CD71 early erythroid cells in infants with BPD. Intriguingly, genes that were correlated in their expression with the relative abundances of specific taxa in the microbiota were significantly enriched for roles in the immune system, suggesting that changes in the microbiota might influence immune gene expression systemically. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious inflammatory condition of the lung and is the most common complication associated with preterm birth. A large body of evidence now suggests that the gut microbiota can influence immunity and inflammation systemically; however, the role of the gut microbiota in BPD has not been evaluated to date. Here, we report that there are significant differences in the gut microbiota of infants born at <29 weeks gestation and subsequently diagnosed with BPD, which are particularly pronounced when infants are stratified by birth mode. We also show that erythroid and immune gene expression levels are significantly altered in BPD infants. Interestingly, we identified an association between the composition of the microbiota and immune gene expression in blood in early life. Together, these findings suggest that the composition of the microbiota may influence the risk of developing BPD and, more generally, may shape systemic immune gene expression.Copyright © 2019 Ryan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663723>Tetra-2,3-pyrazinoporphyrazines with Peripherally Appended Pyridine Rings. 20. Mono- and Pentanuclear Al and Ga Complexes: Synthesis and Physicochemical and Photoactivity Studies.</a></h2><p>The autocyclotetramerization of the precursor 2,3-dicyano-5,6-di(2'-pyridyl)pyrazine [(CN)PyPyz] in the presence of MCl compounds (M = Al, Ga) leads to the formation of the new mononuclear porphyrazine complexes [PyTPyzPzMCl]·HO (PyTPyzPz = tetrakis-2,3-[5,6-di(2-pyridyl)pyrazino]porphyrazinato anion). From these species, the hydroxide analogues [PyTPyzPzMOH]·HO were obtained by contact with hot water, and their corresponding pentanuclear species [(PdCl)PyTPyzPzMCl]·HO could be easily formed by the reaction with PdCl. Physicochemical characterization of the mono- and pentanuclear macrocycles was based on elemental analysis, and mass, powder X-ray, and IR spectra. UV-vis spectral studies of the mononuclear species in solutions of DMF, DMSO, or pyridine ( ≈ 10-10 M) indicate (mainly in DMF and DMSO) the initial presence of aggregation, in some cases accompanied by the concomitant occurrence for the complex of a one-electron reduction. While disaggregation into a single species evolves spontaneously over time, the -1 charged species, eventually also found present, can be brought back to its neutral form by addition of a slight amount of HCl, the final spectrum showing the presence of the starting neutral species in its pure monomeric form. Similar aspects were faced also for the parent pentanuclear complexes. Cyclic voltammetry experiments, conducted for the mono-/pentanuclear complexes in DMF and DMSO ( ≈ 10 M), exhibit progressive one-electron reductions (1 → 4) characterized by  values (V vs SCE) positioned to significantly less negative values than those known for the phthalocyanine (Pc) analogues, these data confirming the previously already proven higher electron-deficient character of the M derivatives of the PyTPyzPz macrocycle with respect to Pc. The role of the present new series of Al and Ga macrocyclic species to act as photosensitizers for the generation of singlet , O, the cytotoxic agent in the anticancer treatment known as photodynamic therapy (PDT), has been explored in DMF/HCl. Among the quantum yields Φ, the value found for the Ga complex [PyTPyzPzGaCl] (0.68), practically coincident with that observed for the TTDPz analogue (0.69), is well above those of most porphyrazines analogues (Φ = 0.4-0.6), a result encouraging further research work for potential applications in the biochemical field.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661108>Graphene oxide mediated co-generation of C-doping and  defects in BiWO nanosheets: a combined DRIFTS and DFT investigation.</a></h2><p>In order to efficiently control air pollutants using photocatalytic technology, the co-generation of C-doping and  vacancies (OVs) in Bi2WO6 (BWO) nanosheets was achieved by a graphene oxide (GO)-mediated hydrothermal method. The photocatalytic performance was highly improved with the synergistic effects of C-doping and OVs. The experimental characterization and DFT calculations were closely combined to reveal that the C element could serve as both an electron acceptor and channel for charge transfer to promote charge separation. Meanwhile, the OVs could induce the formation of a defect level in the band gap which increases the production of ˙OH as the primary reactive species by introducing more light-generated holes into the valence band. Meanwhile, the OVs could enhance the generation of ˙O2- species via the promotion of O2 adsorption and activation on the catalyst surface. Moreover, the reaction intermediates were monitored and the mechanism of photocatalytic NO oxidation was proposed based on in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). The design concept of photocatalyst modification with C-doping and OVs could offer a novel strategy to enhance the performance for environmental applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657336>[Meta-analysis of clinical efficacy of Helmet non-invasive ventilation and  therapy on patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure].</a></h2><p>To systematically evaluate the clinical efficacies of Helmet non-invasive ventilation and  therapy on patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure.The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for comparison of efficacy between Helmet non-invasive ventilation and  therapy for treatment of patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure published by Wanfang database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biology Medicine (CBM), PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were retrieved.

The indexes of the study outcomes included oxygenation index, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO), endotracheal intubation rate, hospital mortality and intolerance rate. Literature search and data extraction was performed separately by two researchers. Quality assessment of literature was conducted according to the risk of bias criterion provided by Cochrane collaboration net. The extractive data were Meta-analyzed by RevMan 5.1.0. Funnel plot and Egger regression analysis was employed to detect publication bias.Six RCTs including 5 English studies and 1 Chinese study were selected. Finally, 547 patients were enrolled, with 270 patients in Helmet non-invasive ventilation group and 277 in  therapy group. The study quality assessment revealed that the overall risk of bias was low, and no publication bias was detected by the funnel plot and Egger regression analysis.

One of the major challenges for Li-O2 batteries is the high charge overpotential, which results in a low energy efficiency. In this work size-selected subnanometer Ir clusters are used to investigate cathode materials that can help control lithium superoxide formation during discharge, which has good electronic conductivity needed for low charge potentials. It is found that Ir particles can lead to lithium superoxide formation as the discharge product with Ir particle sizes of ~1.5 nm giving the lowest charge potentials. During discharge these 1.5 nm Ir nanoparticles surprisingly evolve to larger ones while incorporating Li to form core-shell structures with Ir3Li shells, which probably act as templates for growth of lithium superoxide during discharge. Various characterization techniques including DEMS, Raman, titration, and HRTEM are used to characterize the LiO2 discharge product and the evolution of the Ir nanoparticles. Density functional calculations are used to provide insight into the mechanism for formation of the core-shell Ir3Li particles. The in situ formed Ir3Li core-shell nanoparticles discovered here provide a new direction for active cathode materials that can reduce charge overpotentials in Li-O2 batteries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659247>Time and rate dependent synaptic learning in neuro-mimicking resistive memories.</a></h2><p>Memristors have demonstrated immense potential as building blocks in future adaptive neuromorphic architectures. Recently, there has been focus on emulating specific synaptic functions of the mammalian nervous system by either tailoring the functional oxides or engineering the external programming hardware. However, high device-to-device variability in memristors induced by the electroforming process and complicated programming hardware are among the key challenges that hinder achieving biomimetic neuromorphic networks. Here, a simple hybrid complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-memristor approach is reported to implement different synaptic learning rules by utilizing a CMOS-compatible memristor based on -deficient SrTiO (STO). The potential of such hybrid CMOS-memristor approach is demonstrated by successfully imitating time-dependent (pair and triplet spike-time-dependent-plasticity) and rate-dependent (Bienenstosk-Cooper-Munro) synaptic learning rules. Experimental results are benchmarked against in-vitro measurements from hippocampal and visual cortices with good agreement. The scalability of synaptic devices and their programming through a CMOS drive circuitry elaborates the potential of such an approach in realizing adaptive neuromorphic computation and networks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658159>Effect of adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PTEN on brain oxidative damage and neuroinflammation in a rat kindling model of epilepsy.</a></h2><p>Epilepsy is a chronic and severe neurological disorder. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN)-deficient mice exhibit learning and memory deficits and spontaneous epilepsy. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of PTEN in brain oxidative damage and neuroinflammation in a rat model of epilepsy.An adenovirus (Ad)-PTEN vector was constructed, and status epilepticus (SE) was induced in 41 model rats using lithium chloride-pilocarpine. Thirty-six SE rats were then allocated into the Ad-PTEN, Ad-LacZ, and SE groups, those were administered intracerebroventricular injections of Ad-PTEN, Ad-enhanced green fluorescent protein, and phosphate buffer saline, respectively. The normal group was comprised of healthy Sprague-Dawley rats. Nissl staining was conducted to evaluate neuronal damage, and immunohistochemistry was conducted to observe the morphology of cells in the hippocampal CA1 region and the distribution of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) and ED1 (rat homologue of human CD68). Levels of apoptosis-related proteins, inflammatory-related factors, and oxidative stress-related markers (reactive  species [ROS], glutathione [GSH], superoxide dismutase [SOD], and malondialdehyde [MDA]) were measured. Comparisons between multiple groups were conducted using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and pairwise comparisons after ANOVA were conducted using the Tukey multiple comparisons test.After SE induction, PTEN expression in the rat brain exhibited a four-fold decrease (P = 0.000) and the expression of both Iba1 and ED1 increased. Furthermore, significant neuronal loss, oxidative damage, and neuroinflammation were observed in the SE rat brain. After intracerebroventricular injection of Ad-PTEN, PTEN expression exhibited a three-fold increase (P = 0.003), and the expression of both Iba1 and ED1 decreased. Additionally, neurons were restored and neuronal apoptosis was inhibited. Furthermore, ROS and MDA levels decreased, GSH level and SOD activity increased, and neuroinflammation was reduced.Our study demonstrated that brain oxidative damage and neuroinflammation in SE rats were ameliorated by intracerebroventricular injection of Ad-PTEN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661096>Defect formation and migration in Nasicon LiAlTi(PO).</a></h2><p>NASICON-structured materials of the composition Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 are regarded as solid electrolytes with high Li-ion conductivity applicable in all solid-state batteries.

It is, therefore, highly desirable to develop novel materials and strategies for dealing with the clenbuterol. Herein, functional polymer microspheres prepared by Pickering emulsion polymerization were explored for the selective enrichment of the clenbuterol, and their structure and  functionalities could be tailor-made by a molecular imprinting process. The clenbuterol imprinting was adequately demonstrated to not only increase the particle size (~52 nm vs. ~42 nm) and create cavities for the accommodation of the clenbuterol molecules, but also reduce the  functionalities of the resulting molecularly imprinted polymer microspheres (MIPMs) by approximately 4 at.%, which is believed to correlate with the high specificity of the MIPMs. Various characterization methods were employed to evidence these findings, including scanning electron microscopy, BET measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and elemental mapping examination. More importantly, the MIPMs showed a markedly superior enrichment capability towards clenbuterol to the counterpart, that is, non-molecularly imprinted polymer microspheres (NIPMs). Compared to the NIPMs without specificity for clenbuterol, the MIPMs exhibited an impressive selectivity to clenbuterol, with the relative selectivity coefficient () values largely exceeding 1, thus corroborating that the useful molecular imprinting led to the generation of the binding sites complementary to the clenbuterol molecule in the size and functionalities. The MIPMs were also employed as the stationary phase to fabricate molecularly imprinting solid-phase extraction column, and the spike recovery was demonstrated to be not significantly decreased even after nine cycles. Furthermore, the reliability of the method was also evidenced through the comparison of the MIPMs prepared from different batches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662969>Intermittent Hypoxic Training at Lactate Threshold Intensity Improves Aiming Performance in Well-Trained Biathletes with Little Change of Cardiovascular Variables.</a></h2><p>The main objective of this research was to evaluate the efficacy of intermittent hypoxic training (IHT) on aiming performance and aerobic capacity in biathletes. Fourteen male biathletes were randomly divided into a hypoxia group (H) ( = 7), which trained three times per week in a normobaric hypoxic environment (FiO = 16.5%, 2000 m a.s.l.) with lactate threshold intensity (LT) determined in hypoxia, and a control group (C) ( = 7), which exercised under normoxic conditions with LT intensity determined in normoxia. The training program included three weekly microcycles, followed by three days of recovery. The main part of the interval workout consisted of four 7 min (1 week), 8 min (2 week), or 9 min (3 week) running bouts at treadmill separated by 2 minutes of active recovery. After the warm-up and during the rest between the bouts, the athletes performed aiming to the target in the standing position with a sporting rifle (20 s). The results showed that the IHT caused a significant ( < 0.05) increase in retention time in the target at rest (RT9) by 14.4% in hypoxia, whereas RT postincremental test (RT9) increased by 27.4% in normoxia and 26.7% in hypoxia. No significant changes in this variable were found in group C. Additionally, the capillary  saturation at the end of the maximal effort (SO) in hypoxia increased significantly ( < 0.001) by ∼4% after IHT. The maximal workload during the incremental test (WR) in normoxia also increased significantly ( < 0.001) by 6.3% after IHT. Furthermore, in absolute and relative values of VO in normoxia, there was a propensity ( < 0.07) for increasing this value by 5% in group H. In conclusion, the main findings of this study showed a significant improvement in resting and postexercise aiming performance in normoxia and hypoxia. Furthermore, the results demonstrated beneficial effects of the IHT protocol on aerobic capacity of biathletes.Copyright © 2019 Miłosz Czuba et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660818>Curcumin prevents brain damage and cognitive dysfunction during ischemic-reperfusion through the regulation of miR-7-5p.</a></h2><p>This study was to investigate the potential protective effects of curcumin in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CIR) and its regulation of miR-7.Rats were occluded by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1.5 h and reperfused for 2 h to establish a local CIR model. After 24 hours of model establishment, MCAO rats were given curcumin for 3 days by intragastric administration. PC12 cells were cultured for 6 h in -glucose deprivation medium and then reoxygenated for 24 h to establish an -glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model. The OGD/R model cells were treated with curcumin for 48 h.Curcumin inhibited the decrease of miR-7-5p expression and increase of RelA p65 expression induced by CIR and ODG/R. RelA p65 was a target of miR-7-5p. MiR-7-5p antagonists were able to counteract the effect of curcumin on the expression of RelA p65 in ischemic brain tissue of MCAO rats and OGD/R model cells. Curcumin improved OGD/R-induced inhibition of cell activity, necrosis and apoptosis. Curcumin significantly reduced the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, reactive  species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the activity of superoxide dismutases (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in OGD/R-induced cells. Curcumin may inhibit OGD/R-induced cell damage by regulating miR-7-5p. Curcumin improved cerebral infarction, nerve damage and cognitive dysfunction in rats with CIR, which may be related to the regulation of miR-7-5p/RelA p65 axis.Curcumin exerts cerebral protection by attenuating cell necrosis and apoptosis, inflammatory response and oxidative stress following CIR, which may be related to its regulation of the miR-7/RELA p65 axis.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656372>Physiology of  Transport and its Determinants in Intensive Care Unit.</a></h2><p>Transport of  is one of the most important functions of blood.

However, the activity of these materials is hampered by their low surface area translating into low concentration of active sites accessible for reactants. Herein, we report, for the first time, a bottom-up preparation of PCN nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution (~10±3 nm), which are fully soluble in water showing no gelation or precipitation over several months, and allow carrying out photocatalysis under quasi-homogeneous conditions. The superior performance of water-soluble PCN, as compared to conventional solid PCN, is demonstrated in photocatalytic H2O2 production via reduction of  accompanied by highly selective (up to 100%) photooxidation of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol or other lignocellulose-derived feedstock (ethanol, glycerol, glucose).

The analysis was preceded by a review of recent data on industrial effluent treatability with reference to published chemical  demand (COD) removal data for four effluent types: food and beverage, textile, petroleum and landfill leachate. Outcomes revealed labour costs to be the most significant of those considered, contributing 50% of the OPEX for a 10,000 m/day capacity municipal wastewater treatment works. An analysis of the OPEX sensitivity to 12 individual parameters (labour cost, flux, electrical energy cost, membrane life, feed COD, membrane cost, membrane air-scour rate, chemicals cost, waste disposal cost, mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration, recirculation ratio, and transmembrane pressure) revealed OPEX to be most sensitive to labour effort and/or costs for all scenarios considered other than a large (100,000 m/day capacity) works, for which flux and electrical energy costs were found to be slightly more influential. It was concluded that for small- to medium-sized plants cost savings are best made through improving the robustness of plants to limit manual intervention necessitated by unforeseen events, such as electrical/mechanical failure, foaming or sludging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660950>Protective effects of Oxya chinensis sinuosa Mishchenko against ultraviolet B-induced photodamage in hairless mice.</a></h2><p>Edible insects, including Oxya chinensis sinuosa Mishchenko (Oc), which is consumed as food in Asia, are considered as a human food shortage alternative, and also as a preventive measure against environmental destruction. Ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation, which causes skin photodamage, is considered as an extrinsic skin aging factor. It reduces skin hydration, and increases wrinkle formation and reactive  species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokine expression. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the anti-aging effects of an ethanol extract of Oc (Oc.Ex).A UVB-irradiated hairless mouse model was used to examine relevant changes in skin hydration, wrinkle formation, and skin epidermal thickness. Also, antioxidant markers such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were analyzed, and Oc. Ex skin protective effects against UVB irradiation-induced photoaging were examined by determining the levels of skin hydration factors.Oc.Ex improved epidermal barrier dysfunctions such as increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and capacitance reduction in UVB-irradiated mice. It upregulated skin hydration-related markers, including hyaluronic acid (HA), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, and pro-collagen, in UVB-irradiated mice, compared with the vehicle control group. It also reduced UVB-induced wrinkle formation, collagen degradation, and epidermal thickness. Additionally, it remarkably suppressed the increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and restored the activity of SOD and CAT in UVB-irradiated mice, compared with the vehicle control group. Furthermore, Oc. Ex treatment downregulated the production of inflammatory cytokines and phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathway activated by UVB irradiation.This study revealed that Oc. Ex reduced skin thickness and the degradation of collagen fibers by increasing hydration markers and collagen-regulating factors in the skin of UVB-irradiated mice. It also inhibited UVB-induced antioxidant enzyme activity and inflammatory cytokine expression via MAPK signaling downregulation, suggesting that it prevents UVB-induced skin damage and photoaging, and has potential for clinical development in skin disease treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661119>Glutamine affects T24 bladder cancer cell proliferation by activating STAT3 through ROS and glutaminolysis.</a></h2><p>Changes in metabolism are common phenomena in tumors. Glutamine (Gln) has been documented to play a critical role in tumor growth. In this study, we aimed to to explore the mechanisms through which bladder cancer cells utilize Gln to fulfill their biosynthetic needs during proliferation. In addition, the roles of Gln in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, reactive  species (ROS) regulation, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) expression were examined in vitro in the T24 bladder cancer cell line. The results revealed that the T24 cell line was markedly Gln‑dependent and that Gln supplementation promoted T24 proliferation through the actions of Gln as a ROS moderator and as a metabolic fuel in the TCA cycle. Importantly, extracellular Gln deprivation deregulated the production of the transcription factor, STAT3. Additionally, STAT3 expression was affected by the degree of Gln metabolism, as regulated by Gln intermediates and ROS. Thus, on the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that Gln promotes the proliferation of the Gln‑dependent bladder cancer cell line, T24, by supplementing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and neutralizing ROS to activate the STAT3 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663732>Influence of pH and Divalent Metals Relevant to California Rice Fields on the Hydroxide-Mediated Hydrolysis of the Insecticide Chlorantraniliprole.</a></h2><p>The hydrolysis of chlorantraniliprole (3-bromo-N-[4-chloro-2-methyl-6-(methylcarbamoyl)phenyl]-1-(3-chloro-2-pyridine-2-yl)-1-pyrazole-5-carboxamide; CAP) was investigated over the pH range of 6-10, reflective of California rice field conditions, with variable additions of Cu, Zn, Mn, or Ni. Dissipation accelerated as pH increased with half-lives ranging from 26.9 to 2.2 days with slight inhibition in rice field water. The addition of divalent metals was not observed to catalyze the hydrolysis of CAP at pH 6, indicating that the insecticide is likely to remain recalcitrant to hydrolysis in neutral or acidic surface waters. However, Mn and Ni were observed to inhibit hydrolysis at pH 8 and 9. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared analysis supports the conclusion that divalent metals may withdraw electron density from the amide nitrogen via interaction with the amide , though additional quantum chemical modeling is necessary to provide further mechanistic insights. Overall, the hydrolysis of CAP in California rice fields and their surrounding surface waters will be dominated by pH and inhibited by dissolved metal species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665431>PAMP-INDUCED SECRETED PEPTIDE 3 (PIP3) modulates immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana.</a></h2><p>Small post-translationally modified peptides are important signalling components of plant defence responses against phytopathogens, acting both as positive and negative modulators. PAMP-INDUCED SECRETED PEPTIDE (PIP) 1 and 2 has been shown to amplify plant immunity. Here we investigate the role of the related peptide PIP3 in the regulation of immune response in Arabidopsis. Treatment with synthetic PIP peptides led to similar transcriptome reprogramming, indicating an effect on innate immunity-related processes and phytohormones, including jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and signalling. PIP3 overexpressing (OX) plants showed enhanced growth inhibition in response to flg22 exposure. In addition, flg22-induced production of reactive  species and callose deposition were significantly reduced in PIP3-OX plants. Interestingly, PIP3-OX plants showed increased susceptibility both toward Botrytis cinerea and the biotrophic pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Expression of both JA and salicylic acid biosynthesis and signalling genes was more induced during B. cinerea infection in PIP3-OX plants compared with wild-type plants. Promoter and ChIP-seq analyses indicated that the transcription factors WRKY18, WRKY33 and WRKY40 cooperatively act as repressors for PIP3. The results point to a fine-tuning role for PIP3 in modulation of immunity through the regulation of SA and JA biosynthesis and signalling pathways in Arabidopsis.© The Author(s) 2019.

Most of the signals used to measure the patients' participation are EMG signals or  consumption, which increase the cost and the complexity of the robotic device. In this work, we design a multi-sensor system robot with torque and six-dimensional force sensors to gauge the patients' participation in training. By establishing the static equation of the mechanical leg, the man-machine interaction force of the patient can be accurately extracted. Using the impedance model, the auxiliary force training mode is established, and the difficulty of the target task is changed by adjusting the K value of auxiliary force. Participation models with three intensities were developed offline using support vector machines, for which the C and σ parameters are optimized by the hybrid quantum particle swarm optimization and support vector machines (Hybrid QPSO-SVM) algorithm. An experimental statistical analysis was conducted on ten volunteers' motion representation in different training tasks, which are divided into three stages: over-challenge, challenge, less challenge, by choosing characteristic quantities with significant differences among the various difficulty task stages, as a training set for the support vector machines (SVM). Experimental results from 12 volunteers, with tasks conducted on the lower limb rehabilitation robot LLR-II show that the rehabilitation robot can accurately predict patient participation and training task difficulty. The prediction accuracy reflects the superiority of the Hybrid QPSO-SVM algorithm.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661680>Cardio-respiratory signal extraction from video camera data for continuous non-contact vital sign monitoring using deep learning.</a></h2><p>Non-contact vital sign monitoring enables the estimation of vital signs, such as heart rate, respiratory rate and  saturation (SpO2), by measuring subtle color changes on the skin surface using a video camera. For patients in a hospital ward, the main challenges in the development of continuous and robust non-contact monitoring techniques are the identification of time periods and the segmentation of skin regions of interest (ROIs) from which vital signs can be estimated. This paper presents two convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The first network was designed for detecting the presence of a patient and segmenting the patient's skin area. The second network combined the output from the first network with optical flow for identifying time periods of clinical intervention so that these periods can be excluded from the estimation of vital signs. Both networks were trained using video recordings from a clinical study involving 15 pre-term infants conducted in the high dependency area of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, UK. The proposed methods achieved an accuracy of 98.8\% for patient detection, a mean intersection-over-union (IOU) score of 88.6\% for skin segmentation and an accuracy of 94.5\% for clinical intervention detection using two-fold cross validation. Our deep learning models produced accurate results and were robust to different skin tones, changes in light conditions, pose variations and different clinical interventions by medical staff and family visitors. Finally, we show that cardio-respiratory signals can be continuously derived from the patient's skin during which the patient is present and no clinical intervention is undertaken.Creative Commons Attribution license.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661440>Modelling gas-liquid mass transfer in wastewater treatment: when current knowledge needs to encounter engineering practice and vice versa.</a></h2><p>Gas-liquid mass transfer in wastewater treatment processes has received considerable attention over the last decades from both academia and industry. Indeed, improvements in modelling gas-liquid mass transfer can bring huge benefits in terms of reaction rates, plant energy expenditure, acid-base equilibria and greenhouse gas emissions. Despite these efforts, there is still no universally valid correlation between the design and operating parameters of a wastewater treatment plant and the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficients. That is why the current practice for  mass transfer modelling is to apply overly simplified models, which come with multiple assumptions that are not valid for most applications. To deal with these complexities, correction factors were introduced over time. The most uncertain of them is the α-factor. To build fundamental gas-liquid mass transfer knowledge more advanced modelling paradigms have been applied more recently. Yet these come with a high level of complexity making them impractical for rapid process design and optimisation in an industrial setting. However, the knowledge gained from these more advanced models can help in improving the way the α-factor and thus gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient should be applied. That is why the presented work aims at clarifying the current state-of-the-art in gas-liquid mass transfer modelling of  and other gases, but also to direct academic research efforts towards the needs of the industrial practitioners.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661534>Common variants in glyoxalase I do not increase chronic pancreatitis risk.</a></h2><p>Chronic pancreatitis (CP) may be caused by oxidative stress.

A reduction in GLO1 activity results in increased ROS. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GLO1 have been linked to various inflammatory diseases. Here, we analyzed whether common GLO1 variants are associated with alcoholic (ACP) and non-alcoholic CP (NACP).Using melting curve analysis, we genotyped a screening cohort of 223 ACP, 218 NACP patients, and 328 controls for 11 tagging SNPs defined by the SNPinfo LD TAG SNP Selection tool and the functionally relevant variant rs4746.

Adult females were divided into groups of 10 and administered different doses of atrazine through gavage, during gestational or breastfeeding period. At 3 months of age, the F1 adult male progeny of these females was evaluated. We observed a drastic reduction in the total and progressive motility of male sperm cells at all doses and during both the exposure periods. Moreover, the plasma membrane integrity of adult male sperm cells decreased at all doses of atrazine administered during the breastfeeding, whereas the membrane fluidity of these cells increased at all tested doses. Atrazine led to a decrease in the sperm mitochondrial functionality at all doses and during both exposure periods. The damage to the sperm DNA was higher in males exposed to the highest dose (1.0 mg/kg) during the gestation period, and in animals exposed to the lowest dose of atrazine (0.1 mg/kg) during breastfeeding period. Furthermore, the highest dose (1.0 mg/kg) of atrazine reduced the sperm concentration. Furthermore, the reduced levels of reactive  species (ROS) were observed at all evaluated doses in males exposed during the gestation period. These results suggest that the administration of low doses of atrazine at critical periods of development may permanently reduce the sperm quality in C. laucha.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661907>Chromatic Sensor to Determine  Presence for Applications in Intelligent Packaging.</a></h2><p>A chromatic sensor has been designed for the detection of  in package headspace.

The aim of this study is to explore the potential neuroprotective mechanism of curcumin against -glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury in HT22 cells and investigate whether type-2 superoxide dismutase (SOD2) is involved in the curcumin-induced protection. In the present study, HT22 neuronal cells were treated with 3 h OGD plus 24 h reoxygenation to mimic ischemia/reperfusion injury. Compared with the normal cultured control group, OGD/R treatment reduced cell viability and SOD2 expression, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial complex I activity, damaged cell morphology, and increased lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) release, cell apoptosis, intracellular reactive  species (ROS), and mitochondrial superoxide ( < 0.05). Meanwhile, coadministration of 100 ng/ml curcumin reduced the cell injury and apoptosis, inhibited intracellular ROS and mitochondrial superoxide accumulation, and ameliorated intracellular SOD2, cell morphology, MMP, and mitochondrial complex I activity.

ROS is increased by activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase family members and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis of mitochondria. Increased ROS is detoxified by superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxiredoxins. ROS has a role as a secondary messenger in signal transduction. Cancer cells induce fluctuations of redox homeostasis by variation of ROS regulated machinery, leading to increased tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Redox-mediated mechanisms of chemoresistance include endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated autophagy, increased cell cycle progression, and increased conversion to metastasis or cancer stem-like cells. This review discusses changes of the redox state in tumorigenesis and redox-mediated mechanisms involved in tolerance to chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661456>Degradation of 1H-benzotriazole using vacuum ultraviolet: a prospective treatment method for micro-pollutants.</a></h2><p>Benzotriazoles (BTs) attract increasing concerns because of abundant presence in environmental water bodies. In this study, degradation of 1H-benzotriazole (1H-BT) was performed by a customized vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) device emitting 185 + 254 nm (VUV/UV-C) irradiation. Degradation of 1H-BT presented an apparent rate constant reached 8.17 × 10 s. Degradation mechanisms included 185 + 254 nm photodegradation and radical reaction. The later one may be the predominant one, which presented a k at (7.3 ± 0.8) × 10 M s. Effects of anions revealed that VUV interception and radical trapping were the dominant restraining factors. Degradation of 1H-BT can be attributed to VUV induced radical-based oxidation. Radical-induced addition, substitution and fracture generated abundant hydroxylated and open-loop products during 10-45 min. Identification using reactive  species and apoptosis in Escherichia coli was conducted. Variations of these two indicators revealed that the incomplete degradation products presented higher toxicities than 1H-BT, and a further mineralization reduced their toxicities. In the pure water solution with little impurities, VUV can induce efficient degradation of 1H-BT, suggesting its potential for eliminating and detoxifying MPs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660990>Potential biomarkers for neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration at short and long term after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic insult in rat.</a></h2><p>Hypoxic-ischemic (HI) encephalopathy causes life-long morbidity and premature mortality in term neonates. Therapies in addition to whole-body cooling are under development to treat the neonate at risk for HI encephalopathy, but are not a quickly measured serum inflammatory or neuronal biomarkers to rapidly and accurately identify brain injury in order to follow the efficacy of therapies.In order to identify potential biomarkers for early inflammatory and neurodegenerative events after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia, both male and female Wistar rat pups at postnatal day 7 (P7) were used and had their right carotid artery permanently doubly occluded and exposed to 8%  for 90 min. Sensory and cognitive parameters were assessed by open field, rotarod, CatWalk, and Morris water maze (MWM) test. Plasma and CSF biomarkers were investigated on the acute (24 h and 72 h) and chronic phase (4 weeks). Brains were assessed for gene expression analysis by quantitative RT-PCR Array.We found a delay of neurological reflex maturation in HI rats. We observed anxiolytic-like baseline behavior in males more than females following HI injury. HI rats held on the rotarod for a shorter time comparing to sham. HI injury impaired spatial learning ability on MWM test. The CatWalk assessment demonstrated a long-term deficit in gait parameters related to the hind paw. Proinflammatory biomarkers such as IL-6 in plasma and CCL2 and TNF-α in CSF showed an upregulation at 24 h after HI while other cytokines, such as IL-17A and CCL5, were upregulated after 72 h in CSF. At 24 h post-injury, we observed an increase of Edn1, Hif1-α, and Mmp9 mRNA levels in the ipsilateral vs the contralateral hemisphere of HI rats. An upregulation of genes involved with clotting and hematopoietic processes was observed 72 h post-injury.Our work showed that, in the immature brain, the HI injury induced an early increased production of several proinflammatory mediators detectable in plasma and CSF, followed by tissue damage in the hypoxic hemisphere and short-term as well as long-lasting neurobehavioral deficits.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661873>Comparison of Mitochondrial Superoxide Detection Ex Vivo/In Vivo by mitoSOX HPLC Method with Classical Assays in Three Different Animal Models of Oxidative Stress.</a></h2><p>Reactive  and nitrogen species (RONS such as HO, nitric oxide) are generated within the organism. Whereas physiological formation rates confer redox regulation of essential cellular functions and provide the basis for adaptive stress responses, their excessive formation contributes to impaired cellular function or even cell death, organ dysfunction and severe disease phenotypes of the entire organism. Therefore, quantification of RONS formation and knowledge of their tissue/cell/compartment-specific distribution is of great biological and clinical importance.Here, we used a high-performance/pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay to quantify the superoxide-specific oxidation product of the mitochondria-targeted fluorescence dye triphenylphosphonium-linked hydroethidium (mitoSOX) in biochemical systems and three animal models with established oxidative stress. Type 1 diabetes (single injection of streptozotocin), hypertension (infusion of angiotensin-II for 7 days) and nitrate tolerance (infusion of nitroglycerin for 4 days) was induced in male Wistar rats.The usefulness of mitoSOX/HPLC for quantification of mitochondrial superoxide was confirmed by xanthine oxidase activity as well as isolated stimulated rat heart mitochondria in the presence or absence of superoxide scavengers. Vascular function was assessed by isometric tension methodology and was impaired in the rat models of oxidative stress. Vascular dysfunction correlated with increased mitoSOX oxidation but also classical RONS detection assays as well as typical markers of oxidative stress.mitoSOX/HPLC represents a valid method for detection of mitochondrial superoxide formation in tissues of different animal disease models and correlates well with functional parameters and other markers of oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657442>The signalling role of ROS in the regulation of seed germination and dormancy.</a></h2><p>Reactive  species (ROS) are versatile compounds which can have toxic or signalling effects in a wide range living organisms, including seeds. They have been reported to play a pivotal role in the regulation of seed germination and dormancy but their mechanisms of action are still far from being fully understood. In this review, we sum-up the major findings that have been carried out this last decade in this field of research and which altogether shed a new light on the signalling roles of ROS in seed physiology. ROS participate in dormancy release during seed dry storage through the direct oxidation of a subset of biomolecules. During seed imbibition, the controlled generation of ROS is involved in the perception and transduction of environmental conditions that control germination. When these conditions are permissive for germination, ROS levels are maintained at a level which triggers cellular events associated with germination, such as hormone signalling. Here we propose that the spatiotemporal regulation of ROS production acts in concert with hormone signalling to regulate the cellular events involved in cell expansion associated with germination.© 2019 The Author(s).

The epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hyaluronic acid (HA) are believed to be involved in the focal adhesion pathway function by regulating the adherence of the molecules to the extracellular matrix. However, regulatory and molecular mechanisms through which the EGF and HA could influence the embryo development is not clear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of continued or stage specific supplementation of EGF and/or HA on the developmental competence and quality of bovine preimplantation embryos and the subsequent consequences on the expression and DNA methylation patterns of genes involved in the focal adhesion pathway. The results revealed that, the supplementation of EGF or HA from zygote to the blastocysts stage reduced the level of reactive  species and increased hatching rate after thawing. On the other hand, HA decreased the apoptotic nuclei and increased blastocyst compared to EGF supplemented group. Gene expression and DNA methylation analysis in the resulting blastocysts indicated that, combined supplementation of EGF and HA increased the expression of genes involved in focal adhesion pathway while supplementation of EGF, HA or a combination of EGF and HA during the entire preimplantation period changed the DNA methylation patterns of genes involved in focal adhesion pathway. On the other hand, blastocysts developed in culture media supplemented with EGF + HA until the 16-cell stage exhibited higher expression level of genes involved in focal adhesion pathway compared to those supplemented after the 16-cell stage. Conversely, the DNA methylation level of candidate genes was increased in the blastocysts obtained from embryos cultured in media supplemented with EGF + HA after 16-cell stage. In conclusion, supplementation of bovine embryos with EGF and/or HA during the entire preimplantation period or in a stage specific manner altered the DNA methylation and expression patterns of candidate genes involved in the focal adhesion pathway which was in turn associated with the observed embryonic developmental competence and quality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659889>Ternary Mixed Spinel Oxides as  Carriers for Chemical Looping Hydrogen Production Operating at 550 oC.</a></h2><p>Operating chemical looping at moderate temperatures circumvents the issue that the sintering of  carrier materials (OCMs) is serious at typical operating conditions, 800-950 oC. However, lower temperatures can lead to deterioration on the reaction kinetics and thereby the low H2 production rate and yield. Here, we present several doped spinel oxides consisting of earth-abundant elements for chemical looping water splitting.

Accordingly, this investigation explores the waste tissue paper derived three dimensional (3D) carbon aerogel (CA) integrated with cerium dioxide (CeO) nanotubes decorated nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (NRGO) as a competent anode to address these technical complements. The direct growth of NRGO and CeO over CA in the form of freestanding and binder-free NRGO/CeO(1:2)/CA alleviates the significant constrains of conventional anode fabrication. The 3D hierarchical architectures of CA with open porous structure provide easy access of bacteria, thus increases the bacterial colonies per unit volume. Furthermore, the hydrogen bonding between the interfacial  atoms of CeO and lysine residues of the cytochrome c in bacteria yields excellent extracellular electron transfer efficiency. The electrostatic interaction between the NRGO and bacteria cells improves the bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, leading to the compact biofilm formation for the improved direct electron transference. With the profits of above, the MFC with NRGO/CeO(1:2)/CA demonstrates a maximum power output and good lifespan performances. The present exploration facts thus access advanced avenues to converting waste matters of tissue paper, human urine, and wastewater into profitable constituents for the development of efficient and durable power producing systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657867>Population Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Dobutamine in Neonates on the First Days of Life.</a></h2><p>To describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) and concentration-related effects of dobutamine in critically ill neonates in the first days of life, using nonlinear mixed effects modelling.Dosing, plasma concentration and haemodynamic monitoring data from a dose-escalation study were analysed with a simultaneous population PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) model. Neonates receiving continuous infusion of dobutamine 5-20 μg kg min were included. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and cardiac output of right and left ventricle (RVO, LVO) were measured on echocardiography; heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), peripheral arterial  saturation and cerebral regional  saturation were recorded from patient monitors.28 neonates with median (range) gestational age of 30.4 (22.7 - 41.0) weeks and birth weight (BW) of 1618 (465 - 4380) g were included. PK data was adequately described by one-compartmental linear structural model. Dobutamine clearance (CL) was described by allometric scaling on BW with sigmoidal maturation function of postmenstrual age (PMA). The final population PK model parameter mean typical value (standard error) estimates, standardised to median BW of 1618 g, were 41.2 (44.5) l h for CL and 5.29 (0.821) l for volume of distribution, which shared a common between subject variability of 29(17.2) %. The relationship between dobutamine concentration and RVO/LVEF was described by linear model, between concentration and LVO/HR/MAP/cerebral fractional tissue  extraction by sigmoidal E model.In postnatal transitional period PK of dobutamine was described by one-compartmental linear model, CL related to BW and PMA.

Furthermore, recent studies suggest that cancer can increase the risk of diabetes. Consequently, diabetes and cancer share many risk factors, but the cellular and molecular pathways correlating diabetes and colon and rectal cancer (CRC) remain far from understood. In this study, we assess the effect of hyperglycemia on cancer cell aggressiveness in human colon epithelial adenocarcinoma cells  and in an experimental animal model of CRC. Our results show that Nox (NADPH oxidase enzyme) 4-induced reactive  species (ROS) production is deregulated in both diabetes and CRC. This is paralleled by inactivation of the AMPK and activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) C1 signaling pathways, resulting in 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) accumulation, induction of DNA damage, and exacerbation of cancer cell aggressiveness, thus contributing to the genomic instability and predisposition to increased tumorigenesis in the diabetic milieu. Pharmacologic activation of AMPK, inhibition of mTORC1, or blockade of Nox4 reduce ROS production, restore the homeostatic signaling of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase/8-oxodG, and lessen the progression of CRC malignancy in a diabetic milieu. Taken together, our results identify the AMPK/mTORC1/Nox4 signaling axis as a molecular switch correlating diabetes and CRC.

All patients were treated with HFNC or conventional  therapy (COT), such as a nasal cannula or venturi mask, immediately after extubation. Decongestive therapy (intravenous furosemide infusion) was administered at the discretion of the attending physician.Of 212 patients treated during the study period, 47 were excluded due to recent open-heart surgery and two, due to insufficient clinical data. The remaining 163 patients had a mean age of 67.4±14.3 years, and 92 (56.4%) were male; 44 patients received HFNC, and 119 COT. Mean weight loss within 72 hours of extubation was -0.86±2.03 kg. A total of 38 patients (23.3%) required reintubation, 21 of whom (12.9%) required reintubation within 72 hours of extubation. In-hospital mortality occurred in 16 patients (9.8%).

Self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) implantation via bronchoscopy can immediately relieve airway stenosis and improve survival. The purpose of this study was to determine the factors that predict survival in patients with airway involvement due to advanced esophageal cancer after SEMS implantation.We conducted this retrospective study from February 2007 to October 2013 at a university hospital. Forty-two patients with advanced esophageal cancer and airway involvement were included. The patients underwent flexible bronchoscopy with electrosurgery and SEMS implantation under bronchoscopic visualization and local anesthesia with no fluoroscopic guidance throughout the procedure.Acute respiratory failure (ARF) occurred in 14 patients (33.3%). After SEMS implantation, 28 patients (66.7%) received additional anti-cancer therapy. The median survival after the procedure was 83 days. A longer survival was seen in the patients who received further anti-cancer therapy [hazard ratio (HR), 0.146; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.06-0.34; P<0.001]. Persistent pneumonia and poor performance status (PS) were potential factors for not receiving further therapy.

Laboratory based studies investigating the mechanisms of thermoregulation in marine ectotherms, however, rarely consider key temporal elements of thermal exposure, such as the rate at which temperature changes. We tested the hypothesis that juvenile seahorses, Hippocampus erectus, from a tropical coastal lagoon in Yucatan, Mexico, would exhibit variations in physiological and behavioural descriptors of thermoregulation when submitted to contrasting regimes during 30 days: temperature constant at 25 °C (C 25); gradually increasing 1 °C every 5 days from 25 to 30 °C (GI 25-30); and constant at 30 °C (C 30). Immediately after exposure, critical maximum temperature, thermal preference,  consumption, partial energy balance, growth rate and survival of seahorses were measured. Seahorses exposed to GI 25-30 showed a significantly higher critical thermal maxima (37.8 ± 0.9 °C), preference (28.7 ± 0.4 °C), growth (1.10 ± 0.49%) and survival (97.6%) than those exposed to C 30 (36.5 ± 1, 29.4 ± 0.3 °C, 0.48 ± 0.32%, 73.8%, respectively). Both high temperature regimes induced metabolic depression, but ramping resulted in a greater amount of energy assimilated (278.9 ± 175.4 J g day) and higher energy efficiency for growth (89.8%) than constant exposure to 30 °C (115.4 ± 63.4 J g day, 65.3%, respectively). Gradually increasing temperature allowed physiological mechanisms of thermal adjustment to take place, reflecting the capacity of juvenile H. erectus to respond to environmental change. Despite its advantage, this capacity is limited in time, since the cumulative effect of thermal exposure affected metabolic performance, eventually compromising survival. The study of seahorse response to thermal variations in the context of ocean warming needs to consider the temporal elements of thermal exposure to foresee its vulnerability under future scenarios.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The  isotope ratio of cellulose is a useful geographic tracer, as it integrates climate and source water signals. A predictive spatial model ("isoscape") of the δ O values of coffee bean cellulose is generated to evaluate coffee region-of-origin claims.The  isotope ratio of α-cellulose extracted from roasted coffee beans was measured via TC/EA-IRMS and used to calculate the δ O value of coffee bean water. The  O isotopic enrichment of coffee bean water relative to the δ O value of local precipitation was modeled as a function of local temperature and humidity. This function was incorporated into a mechanistic model of cellulose δ O values to predict the δ O values of coffee bean cellulose across coffee-producing regions globally.The δ O values of analyzed coffee bean cellulose ranged from approximately +22‰ to +42‰ (VSMOW). As expected, coffees grown in the same region tended to have similar isotope ratios, and the δ O value of coffee bean cellulose was generally higher than the δ O value of modeled stem cellulose for the region. Modeled δ O values of coffee cellulose were within ±2.3‰ of the measured δ O value of coffee cellulose.The  isotope ratio of coffee bean cellulose is a useful indicator of region-of-origin and varies predictably in response to climatic factors and precipitation isotope ratios. The isoscape of coffee bean cellulose δ O values from this study provides a quantitative tool that can be applied to region-of-origin verification of roasted coffee at the point-of-sale.This article is protected by copyright.

Recently, the induction of autophagy has been suggested during ferroptosis. However, this relationship between autophagy and ferroptosis is still controversial and the autophagy-inducing mediator remains unknown. In this study, we confirmed that autophagy is indeed induced by the ferroptosis inducer erastin. Furthermore, we show that autophagy leads to iron-dependent ferroptosis by degradation of ferritin and induction of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) expression, using wild-type and autophagy-deficient cells, BECN1 and LC3B. Consistently, autophagy deficiency caused depletion of intracellular iron and reduced lipid peroxidation, resulting in cell survival during erastin-induced ferroptosis. We further identified that autophagy was triggered by erastin-induced reactive  species (ROS) in ferroptosis. These data provide evidence that ROS-induced autophagy is a key regulator of ferritin degradation and TfR1 expression during ferroptosis. Our study thus contributes toward our understanding of the ferroptotic processes and also helps resolve some of the controversies associated with this phenomenon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657425>ROS-mediated lipid peroxidation as a result of Cu(ii) interaction with FomA protein fragments of F. nucleatum: relevance to colorectal carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>The ability of the studied FomA protein fragments of Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) with copper(ii) ions (Cu(ii)-Ac-KGHGNGEEGTPTVHNE-NH2 (1Cu) and its cyclic analogue Cu(ii)-cyclo(KGHGNGEEGTPTVHNE) (2Cu)) to induce reactive  species (ROS) generation, as a result of red-ox processes, was determined by UV-Vis, luminescence methods, spin trapping and cyclic voltamperometry. The contribution of 1O2 and ˙OH to DNA degradation was proved using gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, the pronounced generation of ROS by mouse colon carcinoma cells (CT26) stimulated by both copper(ii) complexes was confirmed. A fluorescence method allowed the total amounts of ROS generated inside the CT26 cells to be detected, while the spin trapping technique proved that free radicals mainly attached to the membrane surface. These last results are in agreement with the data obtained from the ICP-MS method, which demonstrates that 1Cu and 2Cu complexes are not efficiently accumulated inside the cell. Furthermore, the role of ROS in lipid peroxidation was established. The above-mentioned factors may clearly indicate the contribution of ROS generated by the studied copper(ii) complexes to colonic cell damage, which can lead to a carcinogenesis process.

Fever, cough, sputum, shortness of breath and so on could be found in the two groups. The CD4T lymphocytes were less than normal reference value (410-1 590/μL) in both groups. The chest CT findings manifestations of severe group were scattered patchy shadows and ground glass appearance, all of them were cured and discharged after antiviral, antibiotics, and  treatment. In critical group, the time in hospital was longer, the disease progresses varied faster, the shortness of breath was more apparent, and a large patch of fuzzy and real change shadows on both lungs could be found from CT findings. Compared with the severe group, creatine kinase (CK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) levels in the critical group were increased more significantly [CK (U/L): 704.50 (908.50) vs. 146.00 (220.75), LDH (U/L): 614.50 (492.25) vs. 217.00 (142.75), CRP (mg/L): 85.65 (56.13) vs. 18.80 (50.63), PCT (μg/L): 1.30 (5.00) vs. 0.10 (0.16), all P < 0.01], white blood cells count (WBC) and neutrophil ratio were also increased more significantly [WBC (×10/L): 12.37±7.63 vs. 8.29±3.32, neutrophil ratio: 0.81±0.11 vs. 0.75±0.11] without statistical differences (both P > 0.05). Nine patients in critical group were cured with cure rate of 56.25%. Seven patients died with mortality of 43.75%, including 2 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and uremia respectively, who had multiple organ failure (MOF) on admission and waive the mechanical ventilation treatment; 3 patients complicated with acute renal failure but abandon hemodialysis; 1 patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma radiotherapy after operation; and 1 patient with chronic renal failure uremia period combined multiple drug-resistant bacteria infection, and died from MOF finally.The patients with severe and critical influenza A (H1N1) show fever, cough, dyspnea, and organ dysfunction in varying degrees. Severe patients were mainly pulmonary lesions, while critical patients show MOF such as heart, lung and kidney, and the lesions progressed rapidly. The major cause of death for critical influenza A (H1N1) may be chronic underlying diseases and MOF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656706>Spatio-temporal patterns of the oceanic conditions and nearshore marine community in the Mid-Atlantic Bight (New Jersey, USA).</a></h2><p>Oceanic environmental conditions influence, shape, and control the geographical range, spatial distribution, abundance, and size composition of marine fauna. Water temperature, salinity, dissolved , depth, and sediment type influence select fish life-history characteristics and community structure. Marine communities are vulnerable to major changes in environmental conditions, but the response and severity depends on various biological or ecological factors, such as resilience to stress or adaptation. Researchers around the world have predicted and documented numerous alterations in fish communities caused by ongoing significant physicochemical shifts associated with natural and potentially unnatural sources, but published studies describing the historical conditions are lacking for most regions around the world, including the coastal waters off New Jersey. Given the need to understand these processes, a multifaceted investigation was undertaken to describe, evaluate, and compare the oceanic conditions and nearshore marine fauna community off New Jersey during 1988 through 2015. Findings showed the oceanic conditions varied over time and space. Mean surface water temperature increased significantly about 0.6 °C per decade, mean salinity decreased about 1.3 psu per decade, and dissolved  increased 0.09 mg/l per decade. Over 20.4 million fish and invertebrates (1,338.3 mt) representing 214 (water temperature preference classified) species () were collected within 15 strata (areas: 12-26) off the coast of New Jersey from 1988 to 2015. Three marine fauna water temperature preference groups (coldwater-adapted, warmwater-adapted, and subtropic-adapted) were identified in the study area. The main coldwater-adapted species collected were longfin squid () ( = 2, 225, 975), Atlantic herring () ( = 544, 032), and little skate () ( = 316, 356), while Atlantic butterfish () ( = 2, 873, 138), scup () ( = 1, 318, 569), and northern searobin () ( = 503, 230) represented the warmwater-adapted group. Bay anchovy () ( = 9, 227, 960), striped anchovy () ( = 245, 214), and Atlantic moonfish () ( = 38, 691) denoted the subtropic-adapted group. Subtropic-adapted species were the most abundant and coldwater-adapted were the least abundant water temperature preference group. The estimated abundance of coldwater-adapted species declined, warmwater-adapted species slightly increased, and subtropic-adapted species decreased with time, which suggest the environmental conditions are influencing and thereby shifting the marine community.©2019 Levesque.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664950>Pertussis hospitalizations among term and preterm infants: clinical course and vaccine effectiveness.</a></h2><p>Pertussis causes severe disease in young unvaccinated infants, with preterms potentially at highest risk. We studied pertussis in hospitalized infants as related to gestational age (GA) and vaccination history.Medical record data of 0-2y old patients hospitalized for pertussis during 2005-2014 were linked to vaccination data. Multivariable logistic regression was used to study the association between GA and vaccination history on the clinical disease course. We compared vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization for pertussis between term and preterm infants (i.e., <37w GA) using the screening method as developed by Farrington.Of 1187 records, medical data from 676 were retrieved. Of these, 12% concerned preterms, whereas they are 8% of Dutch birth cohorts. Median age at admission was 3 m for preterms and 2 m for terms (p < 0.001). Preterms more often had received pertussis vaccination (62% vs 44%; p = 0.01) and more often had coinfections (37% vs 21%; p = 0.01). Preterms tended more often to have complications, to require artificial respiration or to need admittance to the intensive care unit (ICU). Preterms had longer ICU stays (15d vs 9d; p = 0.004). Vaccinated preterms and terms had a lower median length of hospital stay and lower crude risks of apneas and the need for artificial respiration, additional , and ICU admittance than those not vaccinated. After adjustment for presence of coinfections and age at admittance, these differences were not significant, except the lower need of  treatment in vaccinated terms. Effectiveness of the first vaccination against pertussis hospitalizations was 95% (95% CI 93-96%) and 73% (95% CI 20-91%) in terms and preterms, respectively. Effectiveness of the second dose of the primary vaccination series was comparable in both groups (86 and 99%, respectively).Infants hospitalized for pertussis suffer from severe disease. Preterms were overrepresented, with higher need for intensive treatment and less VE of first vaccination. These findings stress the need for alternative prevention, in particular prenatal vaccination of mothers, to reduce pertussis in both groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655958>Nrf2 dysfunction and impaired cellular resilience to oxidative stressors in the aged vasculature: from increased cellular senescence to the pathogenesis of age-related vascular diseases.</a></h2><p>Aging is associated with increased oxidative stress in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, which contribute to the development of a wide range of diseases affecting the circulatory system in older adults. There is growing evidence that in addition to increased production of reactive  species (ROS), aging critically impairs pathways determining cellular resilience to oxidative stressors. In young organisms, the evolutionarily conserved nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant response pathway maintains cellular reduction-oxidation homeostasis and promotes a youthful cellular phenotype by regulating the transcription of an array of cytoprotective (antioxidant, pro-survival, anti-inflammatory and macromolecular damage repair) genes. A critical mechanism by which increased ROS production and Nrf2 dysfunction promote vascular aging and exacerbate pathogenesis of age-related vascular diseases is induction of cellular senescence, an evolutionarily conserved cellular stress response mechanism. Senescent cells cease dividing and undergo distinctive phenotypic alterations, contributing to impairment of angiogenic processes, chronic sterile inflammation, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and barrier dysfunction. Herein, we review mechanisms contributing to dysregulation of Nrf2-driven cytoprotective responses in the aged vasculature and discuss the multifaceted role of Nrf2 dysfunction in the genesis of age-related pathologies affecting the circulatory system, including its role in induction of cellular senescence. Therapeutic strategies that restore Nrf2 signaling and improve vascular resilience in aging are explored to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in older adults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663146>Antihypertensive and antioxidant activities of enzymatic wheat bran protein hydrolysates.</a></h2><p>Bioactive peptides from plant protein sources have been continuously identified as nutrient supplements for low toxicity but multiple physiological activities such as antihypertensive, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory. In this study, wheat bran protein isolate was digested with alcalase to produce wheat bran protein hydrolysate (WPH) that was then separated into different peptide fractions (<1, 1-3, 3-5, and 5-10 kDa) by membrane ultrafiltration. WPH and the peptide fractions were evaluated for in vitro activities such as antioxidant, renin inhibition, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. In addition, the blood pressure-lowering effects of WPH and the <1 kDa peptides were determined by oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Results showed that the ACE and renin inhibitions were significantly (p < .05) higher for the <1 kDa fraction (84.25% ± 2.45%, 75.19% ± 1.75%, respectively) when compared to the WPH and >1 kDa fractions. The <1 kDa fraction also showed significantly (p < .05) higher  radical antioxidant activity with 2044.73 ± 37.45 (μM TE/g protein) when compared to lower values obtained for the >1 kDa membrane fractions and WPH. Oral administration (100 mg/kg body weight) of the <1 kDa membrane fraction to SHRs resulted in a better decrease (-35 mmHg) in the systolic blood pressure when compared to the WPH (-20 mmHg) after 6 hr. And seven peptides (NL, QL, FL, HAL, AAVL, AKTVF, and TPLTR) were identified and amino acid sequence was determined by tandem mass spectrometry. We conclude that the WPH could be considered as a suitable natural antihypertensive and antioxidant resource. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The results of the present study indicate that WPH and its ultrafiltration fractions possess potential as a source of antihypertensive and strong antioxidant peptides. It has been proved that wheat bran has a good blood pressure lowering and antioxidation and other biological activities, and the <1 kDa fraction showing high  radical absorbance capacity level also has better in vitro ACE inhibition and renin-inhibitory activity. The higher antihypertensive efficiency of the <1 kDa fraction may be because the peptides can be better absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or an increased ability to interact with the enzyme (ACE or renin) protein structure to change the active conformation and lead to decreased catalysis. The results of this study indicate that WPH, especially <1 kDa peptide, can be used as a component in formulating antihypertensive functional foods and nutraceuticals, thus improving the industrial production efficiency and bioavailability of wheat bran.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656894>Chemical Structure of Fe-Ni Nanoparticles for Efficient  Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysis.</a></h2><p>Bimetallic iron-nickel-based nanocatalysts are perhaps the most active for the  evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. Recent developments in literature have suggested that the ratio of iron and nickel in Fe-Ni thin films plays an essential role in the performance and stability of the catalysts. In this work, the metallic ratio of iron to nickel was tested in alloy bimetallic nanoparticles. Similar to thin films, nanoparticles with iron-nickel atomic compositions where the atomic iron percentage is ≤50% outperformed nanoparticles with iron-nickel ratios of >50%. Nanoparticles of FeNi, FeNi, and FeNi compositions were evaluated and demonstrated to have overpotentials of 313, 327,, and 364 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA/cm. While the FeNi composition might be considered to have the best OER performance at low current densities, FeNi was found to have the best current density performance at higher current densities, making this composition particularly relevant for electrolysis conditions. However, when stability was evaluated through chronoamperometry and chronopotentiometry, the FeNi composition resulted in the lowest degradation rates of 2.9 μA/h and 17.2 μV/h, respectively. These results suggest that nanoparticles with higher iron and lower nickel content, such as the FeNi composition, should be still taken into consideration while optimizing these bimetallic OER catalysts for overall electrocatalytic performance. Characterization by electron microscopy, diffraction, and X-ray spectroscopy provides detailed chemical and structural information on as-synthesized nanoparticle materials.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663542>Tannic acid-based nanogel as an efficient anti-inflammatory agent.</a></h2><p>Biologically produced reactive  species (ROS) are important signaling molecules in the human body. Despite their importance under normal conditions, abnormal overproduction of ROS under unbalanced or irregular homeostasis can cause severe inflammatory diseases. Various antioxidants have been developed in the biomedical field to resolve high levels of ROS; however, high doses of natural antioxidants such as polyphenol can induce side effects on health. Further, synthetic antioxidants are still controversial in regards to their safety and their complicated synthesis. Inspired from our previous work, a nitric oxide-scavenging nanogel designed for treating rheumatoid arthritis, we report herein a biocompatible tannic acid (TA)-based nanogel as an effective ROS scavenger. A polymeric phenylboronic acid-tannic acid nanogel (PTNG) was prepared by simply mixing through to the formation of phenylboronic ester bonds between polymeric phenylboronate and TA. We focused on the reaction of phenylboronic ester with H2O2, which readily consumes H2O2 molecules, and applied it as an antioxidant. In addition, TA is a well-known antioxidant, specifically a free radical scavenger; thus, we expected combinatory ROS scavenging effects for PTNG. Various ROS scavenging assays revealed the significant antioxidant effects of PTNG. Under an induced inflammation model in vitro, our PTNG showed high biocompatibility as well as strong anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, in the zymosan-induced peritonitis mouse model, a representative acute inflammation model in vivo, PTNG reduced significant neutrophil recruitment and pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating successful alleviation of inflammation. On the basis of these results, we suggest that PTNG has great potential as an antioxidant and should find application in the treatment of further ROS-overproducing inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661433>Role of Nanomedicine in Redox Mediated Healing at Molecular Level.</a></h2><p>Nanomedicine, the offspring born from the marriage of nanotechnology and medicine, has already brought momentous advances in the fight against a plethora of unmet diseases from cardiovascular and neurodegenerative to diabetes and cancer.

In this review, we highlight how the catalytic nature of a transition metal oxide nanomaterial influences the cellular redox homeostasis, supports the cellular antioxidant defence system and reactivates the reactive  species (ROS) mediated signalling to perform normal cell functions like cell cycle, differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation, toxicity, and protein interactions. With numerous examples, we describe the redox modulatory nature of d-block metal oxide nanomaterials and their biomimetic nanozyme activities to protect the mitochondria, the cellular redox mediator which prevents an organism from various diseases. This knowledge will be useful to design new nanomaterials capable of intracellular redox modulation, which in turn can be effective therapeutic agents for treatment of various unmet diseases that are beyond the ability of modern synthetic medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661143>Οlive tree blossom polyphenolic extracts exert antioxidant and antimutagenic activities in vitro and in various cell lines.</a></h2><p>Olive oil has held a prominent place in the Mediterranean diet since ancient times due to its beneficial effects on human health thus, becoming the subject of great scientific interest. Although numerous studies have examined the biological action of olive and olive oil extracts, the literature lacks studies investigating the putative antioxidant capacity of olive tree flower extracts. Given that olive tree flowers are actually by-products of the olive oil production process with high waste burden for the environment, it becomes evident that their exploitation could increase their added value. Therefore, in this study the potential antioxidant action of four olive flower extracts was investigated. All the extracts exerted potent antioxidant activity as indicated using the DPPH• and ABTS•+ assays, as well as antigenotoxic and antimutagenic properties, identified by the results of the plasmid relaxation assay and the Ames test, respectively. Furthermore, the extracts also improved redox status of four cell lines (i.e., EA.hy926, C2C12, HeLa, and HepG2) enhancing reduced glutathione and reducing reactive  species levels using flow cytometry. Taking into account that during olive tree cultivation a considerable amount of olive flowers is generated, the waste burden is high and the management is difficult. Given the optimistic findings of the present study, we believe that the flower-derived extracts may have high added value since they could be used as antioxidants or as foodstuff, food additives and functional food constituents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659387>Do-not-intubate orders in patients with acute respiratory failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>To assess the rates and variability of do-not-intubate orders in patients with acute respiratory failure.We conducted a systematic review of observational studies that enrolled adult patients with acute respiratory failure requiring noninvasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula  from inception to 2019.Twenty-six studies evaluating 10,755 patients were included. The overall pooled rate of do-not-intubate orders was 27%. The pooled rate of do-not-intubate orders in studies from North America was 14% (range 9-22%), from Europe was 28% (range 13-58%), and from Asia was 38% (range 9-83%), p = 0.001. Do-not-intubate rates were higher in studies with higher patient age and in studies where do-not-intubate decisions were made without reported patient/family input. There were no significant differences in do-not-intubate orders according to illness severity, observed mortality, malignancy comorbidity, or methodological quality. Rates of do-not-intubate orders increased over time from 9% in 2000-2004 to 32% in 2015-2019. Only 12 studies (46%) reported information about do-not-intubate decision-making processes. Only 4 studies (15%) also reported rates of do-not-resuscitate.One in four patients with acute respiratory failure (who receive noninvasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula ) has a do-not-intubate order. The rate of do-not-intubate orders has increased over time. There is high inter-study variability in do-not-intubate rates-even when accounting for age and illness severity. There is high variability in patient/family involvement in do-not-intubate decision making processes.

Zn-TNE treated seeds bestowed better seedling vigor index and higher activities of seed stored food mobilizing enzymes (α-amylase and protease). Foliar application of Zn-TNE (0.01-0.06%, v/v) enhanced defense-antioxidant enzymes activities, balanced reactive  species, induced higher content of chlorophyll-a, b and higher lignin deposition in soybean plants. In the field, Zn-TNE application (0.02-0.06%, v/v) significantly controlled bacterial pustule disease (PEDC value 28-79%) and increased grain yield up to 16.6% as compared with bulk thymol application and up to 50% from control. Disease control and higher yield in soybean could be explained by diverse bioactivities of Zn-TNE in maintaining cellular homeostasis of soybean plants.

Activation of elastase, collagenase, and hyaluronidase by reactive  species are related to the degradation of ECM and skin aging. The objective of this study was to determine the anti-elastase and anti-hyaluronidase activity of phosvitin.2. Elastase from porcine pancreas and hyaluronidase from bovine testes were used to study the inhibitory activity of phosvitin. To elucidate the mechanism of enzyme inhibition, a Lineweaver-Burk plot was constructed.3. Phosvitin inhibited elastase and hyaluronidase activity in a dose-dependent manner. The IC value of phosvitin was 31.6 μg/ml and 1,270 μg/ml against elastase and hyaluronidase, respectively. The analysis of elastase and hyaluronidase kinetics indicated that the apparent Michaelis constant (K) was increased by phosvitin but the V value was not affected.4.

However, their potential long term health effects, including carcinogenesis, are unknown. Limited research suggests IONP can induce genotoxicity and neoplastic transformation associated with particle dissolution and release of free iron ions. "Safe by design" strategies involve the modification of particle physicochemical properties to affect subsequent adverse outcomes, such as an amorphous silica coating to reduce IONP dissolution and direct interaction with cells. We hypothesized that long-term exposure to a specific IONP (nFe2O3) would induce neoplastic-like cell transformation related to changes in intracellular iron, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, which could be prevented with an amorphous silica coating (SiO2-nFe2O3). To test this hypothesis, human bronchial epithelial cells (Beas-2B) were continuously exposed to 0.6 µg/cm2 administered dose of nFe2O3 (~0.58 µg/cm2 delivered dose), SiO2-nFe2O3 (~0.55 µg/cm2 delivered dose), or gas metal arc mild steel welding fumes (GMA-MS, ~0.58 µg/cm2 delivered dose) for 6.5 months. GMA-MS are composed of roughly 80% iron/iron oxide and were recently classified as a total human carcinogen. Our results showed that such low-dose/long-term in vitro exposure to nFe2O3 induced a time dependent neoplastic-like cell transformation, as indicated by increased cell proliferation and attachment independent colony formation, which closely matched that induced by GMA-MS. This transformation was associated with decreases in intracellular iron and reactive  species (ROS) production, and the induction of double stranded DNA damage. An amorphous silica-coated but otherwise identical particle (SiO2-nFe2O3) did not induce this neoplastic-like phenotype. Overall, the presented data suggests the carcinogenic potential with long term nFe2O3 exposure and the utility of an amorphous silica coating in "safe by design" hazard reduction strategy, using a physiologically relevant exposure scenario (low-dose/long-term) with model validation using GMA-MS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665522>DAY-LENGTH-DEPENDENT DELAYED-GREENING1, the Arabidopsis Homolog of the Cyanobacterial H+-Extrusion Protein, is Essential for Chloroplast pH Regulation and Optimization of Non-Photochemical Quenching.</a></h2><p>Plants convert solar energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis, which supports almost all life activities on earth. Because the intensity and quality of sunlight can change dramatically throughout the day, various regulatory mechanisms help plants adjust their photosynthetic output accordingly, including the regulation of light energy accumulation to prevent the generation of damaging reactive  species. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is a regulatory mechanism that dissipates excess light energy, but how it is regulated is not fully elucidated. Herein, we report a new NPQ-regulatory protein named Day-Length-dependent Delayed-Greening1 (DLDG1). The Arabidopsis DLDG1 associates with the chloroplast envelope membrane, and the dldg1 mutant had a large NPQ value compared with wild type. The mutant also had a pale-green phenotype in developing leaves but only under continuous light; this phenotype was not observed when dldg1 was cultured in the dark for ≥8 h per day. DLDG1 is a homolog of the plasma-membrane-localizing cyanobacterial proton-extrusion-protein A that is required for light-induced H+ extrusion, and also shows similarity in its amino-acid sequence to that of Ycf10 encoded in the plastid genome. Arabidopsis DLDG1 enhances the growth-retardation phenotype of the Escherichia coli K+/H+ antiporter mutant, and the everted membrane vesicles of the E. coli expressing DLDG1 show the K+/H+ antiport activity. Our findings suggest that DLDG1 functionally interacts with Ycf10 to control H+ homeostasis in chloroplasts, which is important for the light-acclimation response, by optimizing the extent of NPQ.© The Author(s) 2019.

Herein, particulate matter (PM) emitted from artisanal cashew nut roasting, an important economic activity worldwide, was investigated. This study focused on: i) chemical characterization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oxygenated (oxy-) PAHs; ii) intracellular levels of reactive  species (ROS); iii) genotoxic effects and time- and dose-dependent activation of DNA damage signaling, and iv) differential expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, inflammation, cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, using A549 lung cells. Among the PAHs, chrysene, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), benzo[b]fluoranthene, and benz[a]anthracene showed the highest concentrations (7.8-10 ng/m), while benzanthrone and 9,10-anthraquinone were the most abundant oxy-PAHs. Testing of PM extracts was based on B[a]P equivalent doses (B[a]P). IC values for viability were 5.7 and 3.0 nM B[a]P at 24 h and 48 h, respectively. At these low doses, we observed a time- and dose-dependent increase in intracellular levels of ROS, genotoxicity (DNA strand breaks) and DNA damage signaling (phosphorylation of the protein checkpoint kinase 1 - Chk1). In comparison, effects of B[a]P alone was observed at micromolar range. To our knowledge, no previous study has demonstrated an activation of pChk1, a biomarker used to estimate the carcinogenic potency of PAHs in vitro, in lung cells exposed to cashew nut roasting extracts. Sustained induction of expression of several important stress response mediators of xenobiotic metabolism (CYP1A1, CYP1B1), ROS and pro-inflammatory response (IL-8, TNF-α, IL-2, COX2), and DNA damage response (CDKN1A and DDB2) was also identified. In conclusion, our data show high potency of cashew nut roasting PM to induce cellular stress including genotoxicity, and more potently when compared to B[a]P alone. Our study provides new data that will help elucidate the toxic effects of low-levels of PAH mixtures from air PM generated by cashew nut roasting.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Nuclear erythroid-related factor-2 (Nrf2) is a transcriptional regulator of several phase II antioxidant genes, including glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL). In this study, it was hypothesized that Crocin may mediate antioxidant signaling pathway to protect human lung epithelial cells against CS-mediated toxicity and oxidative stress via inducing glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and activation of Nrf2 pathway. Alveolar epithelial cells (A549) were exposed to 1, 2.5 and 5% cigarette smoke extracts (CSE) with or without Crocin (500 μM). After 48 h exposure, the cytotoxicity, oxidant/antioxidant parameters and the Nrf2 pathway modification were assayed. Treatment of A549 cells with all concentrations of CSE dose dependently decreased cell viability, antioxidant levels, GCL and Nrf2 gene expression, which was associated with increased production of reactive  species. Crocin not only restored CSE-depleted GSH levels by enhancing GCL expression via activation of Nrf2 but also quenched the CSE-generation and release of reactive  species. Crocin attenuated CSE-mediated Nrf2 modifications, thereby inducing its nuclear accumulation associated with GCL gene transcription leading to enhanced GSH levels. By inducing GSH synthesis, Crocin attenuates CSE-mediated GSH depletion and protects cells against CSE-induced oxidative stress via Nrf2 pathway. These results may have implications in dietary modulation of natural antioxidants in treatment of pulmonary diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660674>In vivo imaging of hemodynamic redistribution and arteriogenesis across microvascular network.</a></h2><p>Arteriogenesis is an important mechanism that contributes to restoration of  supply in chronically ischemic tissues, but remains incompletely understood due to technical limitations. This study presents a novel approach for comprehensive assessment of the remodeling pattern in a complex microvascular network containing multiple collateral microvessels.We have developed a hardware-software integrated platform for quantitative, longitudinal, and label-free imaging of network-wide hemodynamic changes and arteriogenesis at the single-vessel level. By ligating feeding arteries in the mouse ear, we induced network-wide hemodynamic redistribution and localized arteriogenesis. The utility of this technology's was demonstrated by studying the influence of obesity on microvascular arteriogenesis.Simultaneously monitoring the remodeling of competing collateral arterioles revealed a new, inverse relationship between initial vascular resistance and extent of arteriogenesis. Obese mice exhibited similar remodeling responses to lean mice through the first week, including diameter increase and flow upregulation in collateral arterioles. However, these gains were subsequently lost in obese mice.Capable of label-free, comprehensive, and dynamic quantification of structural and functional changes in the microvascular network in vivo, this platform opens up new opportunities to study the mechanisms of microvascular arteriogenesis, its implications in diseases, and approaches to pharmacologically rectify microvascular dysfunction.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656311>Prescription of exercise training for hypertensives.</a></h2><p>In Japan, there were an estimated 43 million patients with hypertension in 2010.

In this literature review, we examined appropriate exercise prescriptions (e.g., type, intensity, duration per session, and frequency) for the prevention and treatment of hypertension as described in Japanese and foreign articles. This review recommends safe and effective whole-body aerobic exercise at moderate intensity (i.e., 50-65% of maximum  intake, 30-60 min per session, 3-4 times a week) that primarily focuses on the major muscle groups for the prevention and treatment of hypertension. Resistance exercise should be performed at low-intensity without breath-holding and should be used as supplementary exercise, but resistance exercise is contraindicated in patients with hypertension who have chest symptoms such as chest pain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663590>Sulfosalicylic acid/Fe based nanoscale coordination polymers for effective cancer therapy by the Fenton reaction: an inspiration for understanding the role of aspirin in the prevention of cancer.</a></h2><p>Fenton reaction-based reactive  species (ROS) generation provides a new idea for the design of ROS-mediated anticancer agents. Finding ways to increase iron uptake and to elevate the level of H2O2 in cells simultaneously is thus crucial to this strategy. Meanwhile, salicylic acid (SA) or its analogue, as the major metabolite of aspirin, has been reported to be closely associated with an intracellular redox-active product. In this work, a PEG-modified nanoscale coordination polymer (PFNC) via the self-assembly of 5-sulfosalicylic acid (SSA) with Fe3+ ions has been designed for the first time. The results show that the SSA dissociated from the PFNC can lead to the decrease of GSH and the accumulation of H2O2 in cancer cells, and thus elevate cellular ROS via the Fenton reaction. Owing to such intracellular oxidative stress, PFNC-induced ferroptotic cell death was further confirmed. In vitro cytotoxicity studies show that PFNCs display higher cytotoxicity on cancer cells than on normal cells. In vivo experiments further demonstrate that PFNCs not only possess high tumor accumulation, but also significantly inhibit the tumor growth without obvious damage toward the major organs. Based on the results, we expect that this work will provide an inspiration for understanding the role of SA, even aspirin, in the prevention of cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663584>The controllable growth of ultrathin MnO on polydopamine nanospheres as a single nanoplatform for the MRI-guided synergistic therapy of tumors.</a></h2><p>The integration of two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets with biocompatible photothermal nanoparticles may produce effective multifunctional nanotheranostic agents. However, such explorations are hindered due to the lack of suitable methods for the incorporation of both materials. In this work, a simple redox strategy was designed for the controllable growth of ultrathin manganese dioxide nanosheets on polydopamine nanospheres. After loading with methylene blue, the obtained polydopamine@ultrathin manganese dioxide/methylene blue nanoflowers (termed PDA@ut-MnO2/MB NFs) show excellent multiple capabilities for tumor synergistic therapy, for instance: (1) they efficiently modulate the tumor microenvironment (TME) via the generation of O2 and the depletion of glutathione (GSH); (2) they demonstrate favorable photothermal effects during PTT to speed up intratumoral blood flow and chemical reactions, enhancing  distribution and synergistically increasing PDT efficacy; and (3) they support ultrasensitive reduction-responsive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using mice bearing HCT116 colorectal tumors as a model system, PDA@MnO2/MB NFs were shown to achieve near-complete suppression of tumor growth following MRI-guided PDT/PTT synergistic therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659355>Important features of the potential energy surface of the methylamine plus O(D) reaction.</a></h2><p>This research presents an ab initio characterization of the potential energy surface for the methylamine plus 1D  atom reaction, which may be relevant to interstellar chemistry. Geometries and harmonic vibrational frequencies were determined for all stationary points at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. The focal point method along with several additive corrections was used to obtain reliable CCSDT(Q)/CBS potential energy surface features. Extensive conformational analysis and intrinsic reaction coordinate computations were performed to ensure accurate chemical connectivity of the stationary points. Five minima were determined to be possible products of this reaction and three novel transition states were found that were previously unreported or mislabeled in the literature. The pathways we present can be used to guide further searches for NH2 containing species in the interstellar medium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657393>The synergistic effects of Cu clusters and InO on ethanol synthesis from acetic acid hydrogenation.</a></h2><p>The development of high efficiency catalysts for acetic acid hydrogenation to ethanol could ameliorate the petroleum crisis and acetic acid overproduction. Cu and In2O3 catalysts both show catalytic activity for acetic acid hydrogenation. However, monometallic Cu catalysts are less active in the dissociative adsorption of acetic acid through C-O bond breaking, while the H2 adsorption and dissociation ability of In2O3 is weak. In this work, Cu4/In2O3 is designed to enhance the dissociation of both acetic acid and H2. The detailed mechanism of acetic acid hydrogenation to ethanol on Cu4/In2O3 is explored using periodic density functional theory (DFT). The results show that the H2 adsorption and dissociation are enhanced by the Cu cluster, while the H atom spillover from Cu to In2O3 is favorable on the Cu4/In2O3(110) surface. Additionally, a synergistic effect exists between the Cu cluster and In2O3 surface: H2 adsorbs on the Cu cluster and the dissociated H atoms react with acetic acid activated by the In2O3  vacancy. Finally, compared with a Cu2In(100) surface, the Cu4/In2O3(110) surface possesses higher catalytic activity owing to the reduced energy barriers of acetic acid dissociation and hydrogenation of the intermediates (CH3COO*, CH3CHO*, and CH3CH2O*). The Cu4/In2O3 catalyst proposed in this work can provide promising guidance for related catalyst design.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660715>Development of a handheld submersible chemiluminescent sensor: Quantification of superoxide at coral surfaces.</a></h2><p>Reactive  species (ROS) are produced via various photochemical, abiotic and biological pathways. The low concentration and short lifetime of the ROS superoxide (O2-) make it challenging to measure in natural systems. Here we designed, developed, and validated a DIver-operated Submersible Chemiluminescent sensOr (DISCO), the first handheld submersible chemiluminescent sensor. The fluidic system inside DISCO is controlled by two high-precision pumps that introduce sample water and analytical reagents into a mixing cell. The resultant chemiluminescent signal is quantified by a photomultiplier tube, recorded by a miniature onboard computer and monitored in real-time via a hand-held underwater LED-interface. Components are contained within a pressure-bearing housing (max depth 30 m) and an external battery-pack supplies power. Laboratory calibrations with filtered seawater verified instrument stability and precision. Field deployment in Cuban coral reefs quantified background seawater-normalized extracellular superoxide concentrations near coral surfaces (0 - 173 nM) that varied distinctly with coral species. Observations were consistent with previous similar measurements from aquaria and shallow reefs using a standard benchtop system. In situ quantification of superoxide associated with corals was enabled by DISCO, demonstrating the potential application to other shallow water ecosystems and chemical species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662670>Effect of Coffee Silver Skin and Brewers' Spent Grain in the Control of Root-knot Nematodes.</a></h2><p>Plant parasitic nematodes (PPN) are important pests of numerous agricultural crops especially vegetables, able to cause remarkable yield losses correlated to soil nematode population densities at sowing or transplant. The concern on environmental risks, stemming from the use of chemical pesticides acting as nematicides, compels to their replacement with more sustainable pest control strategies. To verify the effect of aqueous extracts of the agro-industry waste coffee silverskin (CS) and brewers' spent grain (BSG) on the widespread root-knot nematode , and on the physiology of tomato plants, a pot experiment was carried out in a glasshouse at 25 ± 2 °C. The possible phytotoxicity of CS and BSG extracts was assessed on garden cress seeds. Tomato plants (landrace of Apulia Region) were transplanted in an artificial nematode infested soil with an initial population density of 3.17 eggs and juveniles/mL soil. CS and BSG were applied at rates of 50 and 100 % (1L/pot). Untreated and Fenamiphos EC 240 (nematicide) (0.01 μL a.i./mL soil) treated plants were used as controls. Reactive  species (ROS) and chlorophyll content of tomato plants were estimated during the experiment. CS extract, at both doses, significantly reduced nematode population in comparison to the untreated control, although it was less effective than Fenamiphos. BSG extract did not reduce final nematode population compared to the control. Ten days after the first treatment, CS 100 %, BSG 50 % and BSG 100% elicited the highest ROS values, which considerably affected the growth of tomato plants in comparison to the untreated plants. The control of these pests is meeting with difficulties because of the current national and international regulations in force, which are limiting the use of synthetic nematicides. Therefore, CS extracts could assume economic relevance, as alternative products to be used in sustainable strategies for nematode management.© 2019 N. Thligene, G. N. Mezzapesa, D. Mondelli, A.

Perspectives and pitfalls.</a></h2><p>Complex I (CI or NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) deficiency is the most frequent cause of mitochondrial respiratory chain defect. Successful attempts to rescue CI function by introducing an exogenous NADH dehydrogenase, such as the NDI1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScNDI1), have been reported although with drawbacks related to competition with CI. In contrast to ScNDI1, which is permanently active in yeast naturally devoid of CI, plant alternative NADH dehydrogenases (NDH-2) support the oxidation of NADH only when the CI is metabolically inactive and conceivably when the concentration of matrix NADH exceeds a certain threshold. We therefore explored the feasibility of CI rescue by NDH-2 from Arabidopsis thaliana (At) in human CI defective fibroblasts.We showed that, other than ScNDI1, two different NDH-2 (AtNDA2 and AtNDB4) targeted to the mitochondria were able to rescue CI deficiency and decrease oxidative stress as indicated by a normalization of SOD activity in human CI-defective fibroblasts. We further demonstrated that when expressed in human control fibroblasts, AtNDA2 shows an affinity for NADH oxidation similar to that of CI, thus competing with CI for the oxidation of NADH as opposed to our initial hypothesis. This competition reduced the amount of ATP produced per  atom reduced to water by half in control cells.In conclusion, despite their promising potential to rescue CI defects, due to a possible competition with remaining CI activity, plant NDH-2 should be regarded with caution as potential therapeutic tools for human mitochondrial diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658881>Anti-hyperlipidemic effects of Campomanesia xanthocarpa aqueous extract and its modulation on oxidative stress and genomic instability in Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>The use of natural products from herbs may be a therapeutic option in dyslipidemia treatment.  (Mart.) O. Berg (Myrtaceae) leaves have been used to decrease cholesterol levels. However, studies to determine activities of this plant on triglycerides metabolism have received little attention. The aim of this study was to examine anti-hyperlipidemic effects of a  aqueous leaf extract (CxAE) and assess protective actions against oxidative stress and DNA damage. The tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia model was used in Wistar rats. Rats were treated orally with CxAE either 250 or 500 mg/kg/day for 7 days prior to tyloxapol administration. Biochemical parameters, oxidative stress levels, and genomic instability were assessed in several tissues. CxAE decreased cholesterol and triglyceride levels in serum and hepatic and renal DNA damage in tyloxapol-treated rats. There was no marked effect on the micronucleus frequency in bone marrow. The extract increased catalase activity and decreased glutathione S-transferase activity in kidney tissue. CxAE showed anti-hyperlipidemic effects, improved oxidative parameters, and protected DNA against damage induced by tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia, suggesting  leaves may be useful in preventing dyslipidemias.

This work aims to evaluate in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells the protective role of GPETAFLR on both oxidative and inflammatory markers known to be involved in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In comparison with stimulated control cells, GPETAFLR increased glutathione production and diminished the secretion and gene expression of VEFG, IL-1β, IL-6, IFNγ, and TNF-α, as well as reactive  species, and nitrite output. Our findings reveal that GPETAFLR, a novel plant peptide, is able to protect against RPE oxidative stress and inflammation. Taken together, these results strongly support innovative nutritional strategies considering Lupinus angustifolius L. as source of proteins to prevent the onset and progression of AMD. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: We reveal a novel nutraceutical impact of GPETAFLR peptide in human RPE cells to prevent oxidative and inflammatory mediators. Our results support that the intake of Lupine angustifolius L., proposed to be a reservoir of GPETAFLR, could lessen the functional decay of RPE cells, leading therefore to a slowdown of the progress of AMD during age. Not only this work, but also future simple clinical studies should raise new nutritional strategies focused on understanding the etiological role of the foods, nutrition, and metabolism in the pathogenesis of ocular disorders.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661353>Identification of novel Nrf2/Keap1 pathway mutations in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</a></h2><p>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignancy of lymphoid progenitor cells, characterized by a wide range of biological and clinical heterogeneity. Oxidative stress is a common problem observed in carcinogenesis and it is involved in developing treatment resistance. Nuclear Factor Erythroid-2-Like 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor is the main regulator of antioxidant responses. The levels of reactive  species (ROS) are tightly controlled and regulated by Nrf2 and its suppressor protein Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Recently, many studies have shown that most of the genes in the Nrf2/Keap1/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB)/phosphotyrosine-independent ligand for the Lck SH2 domain Of 62 KDa (p62) pathway show abnormally high mutational variations in cancer. However, variations in the Nrf2/Keap1/NF-κB1/p62 pathway in pediatric ALL have not been thoroughly investigated, yet. Thirty children, who were diagnosed with pediatirc ALL were included in the study. The Nrf2/Keap1/NF-κB1/p62 pathway variants were analyzed by DNA sequencing analysis. The PolyPhen-2 program was used for identifying pathogenic mutations. Our study examined the molecular dynamics (MD) perspectives of the effect of A159T and E121K mutations on protein stability for the first time in the literature by using the GROMACS45 software package utilizing the OPSLAA force field. Of the detected 17 nucleotide changes, 6 were novel. The study predicted the potential pathological effect of two mutations p. A159T and p.E121K in the Keap1 gene. The MD perspectives revealed that the E121K mutant's observed structural behavior accounted for the key role of His-129 and E121K, where E121K exhibited much higher drift compared to His-129. For a future perspective, it would be meaningful to study the protein-small molecule interactions of the Keap1 protein to elaborate on the drug effects in patients carrying these mutations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656272>Long Non-Coding RNA MEG3 Promotes Apoptosis of Vascular Cells and is Associated with Poor Prognosis in Ischemic Stroke.</a></h2><p>This study focused on the expression pattern of long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) and its value in ischemic stroke (IS).The expression pattern and the roles of MEG3 in the development of IS were explored in mice IS model and human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs). A case-control study, including 215 IS patients and 153 controls, was also conducted to investigate its prognostic value.In vivo study showed that MEG3 increased significantly in the IS group (P=0.004), and its level remained stable within 3 to 48h after the onset of IS. Besides, the survival time of the mouse in the high MEG3 group was significantly lower than that in the low MEG3 group (P=0.042). In vitro study showed that -glucose deprivation (OGD) treatment significantly up-regulated expressions of MEG3, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3, and further promoted apoptosis of hBMECs, while si-MEG3 blocked these effects. A human study showed that MEG3 increased markedly within 48h of IS onset and was positively associated with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (r=0.347, P＜0.001), modified Rankin Scale (r=0.385, P＜0.001), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (r=0.221, P=0.002) level, and infarct volume (r=0.201, P=0.006). Overall survival analysis showed that patients with higher MEG3 expression within 48h had a relatively poor prognosis (P＜0.001). Meanwhile, multivariate analysis revealed that MEG3 was an independent prognostic marker for unfavorable functional outcome and death in IS patients.This study suggested that MEG3 might be considered as an intervention point and potential prognostic indicator for IS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658511>Perivascular Stem Cells Suppress Inflammasome Activation during Inflammatory Responses in Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Perivascular stem cells (PVCs) have been identified as precursors of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that offer promising prospects for application in the development of cellular therapies. Although PVCs have been demonstrated to have greater therapeutic potential compared to bone marrow and adipose tissue-derived MSCs in various diseases, the regulatory role of PVCs on inflammasome activation during macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses has not been investigated.In this study, we found that the PVC secretome effectively alleviates secretion of both caspase-1 and interleukin-1β in lipopolysaccharide-primed and activated human and murine macrophages by blocking inflammasome activation and attenuating the production of mitochondrial reactive  species (ROS). We further showed that the PVC secretome significantly reduces inflammatory responses and endoplasmic reticulum stress in peritoneal macrophages in a mouse model of monosodium urate-induced peritonitis. A cytokine antibody array analysis revealed that the PVC secretome contains high levels of serpin E1 and angiogenin, which may be responsible for the inhibitory effects on mitochondrial ROS generation as well as on inflammasome activation.Our results suggest that PVCs may be therapeutically useful for the treatment of macrophage- and inflammation-mediated diseases by paracrine action via the secretion of various biological factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659343>Computational noise in reward-guided learning drives behavioral variability in volatile environments.</a></h2><p>When learning the value of actions in volatile environments, humans often make seemingly irrational decisions that fail to maximize expected value. We reasoned that these 'non-greedy' decisions, instead of reflecting information seeking during choice, may be caused by computational noise in the learning of action values. Here using reinforcement learning models of behavior and multimodal neurophysiological data, we show that the majority of non-greedy decisions stem from this learning noise. The trial-to-trial variability of sequential learning steps and their impact on behavior could be predicted both by blood  level-dependent responses to obtained rewards in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and by phasic pupillary dilation, suggestive of neuromodulatory fluctuations driven by the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system. Together, these findings indicate that most behavioral variability, rather than reflecting human exploration, is due to the limited computational precision of reward-guided learning.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661838>Fatty Acid-Binding Protein 3 is Critical for α-Synuclein Uptake and MPP-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Cultured Dopaminergic Neurons.</a></h2><p>α-Synuclein is an abundant neuronal protein that accumulates in insoluble inclusions in Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. Fatty acids partially regulate α-Synuclein accumulation, and mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons highly express fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3). We previously demonstrated that FABP3 knockout mice show decreased α-Synuclein oligomerization and neuronal degeneration of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons . In this study, we newly investigated the importance of FABP3 in α-Synuclein uptake, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP)-induced axodendritic retraction, and mitochondrial dysfunction. To disclose the issues, we employed cultured mesencephalic neurons derived from wild type or FABP3 C57BL6 mice and performed immunocytochemical analysis. We demonstrated that TH neurons from FABP3 mice take up α-Synuclein monomers while FABP3 TH neurons do not. The formation of filamentous α-Synuclein inclusions following treatment with MPP was observed only in FABP3, and not in FABP3 neurons. Notably, detailed morphological analysis revealed that FABP neurons did not exhibit MPP-induced axodendritic retraction. Moreover, FABP3 was also critical for MPP-induced reduction of mitochondrial activity and the production of reactive  species. These data indicate that FABP3 is critical for α-Synuclein uptake in dopaminergic neurons, thereby preventing synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659418>Cinnamaldehyde inhibits Candida albicans growth by causing apoptosis and its treatment on vulvovaginal candidiasis and oropharyngeal candidiasis.</a></h2><p>The invasion of Candida albicans is one of the most common fungal infections seen in clinical practice, and serious drug resistance has been reported in recent years. Therefore, new anti-C. albicans drugs must be introduced. In this research, it was demonstrated that cinnamaldehyde (CA) shows strong antimicrobial activity, with 0.26 mg/mL CA being the minimum inhibitory concentration to manage C. albicans. Extraordinarily, we detected that CA accumulated the intracellular reactive  species (ROS) and enhanced the calcium concentration in the cytoplasm and mitochondria through flow cytometry. In addition, we observed that C. albicans cells released Cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential, and activated the metacaspase when exposed to 0.065, 0.13, 0.26, and 0.52 mg/mL CA. Furthermore, to confirm that CA introduces the C. albicans apoptosis, we discovered that when the phosphatidylserine was exposed, DNA damage and chromatin condensation occurred, which were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Finally, demonstrations of phenotype investigation, colony-forming unit (CFU) counts, and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining were conducted to prove that CA possessed the ability to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). From the above, our research indicates that CA is a promising antifungal candidate when applied to C. albicans infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657384>What governs the nature of fouling in forward osmosis (FO) and reverse osmosis (RO)? A molecular dynamics study.</a></h2><p>Membrane fouling is a performance hampering phenomenon, which impacts forward osmosis (FO) and reverse osmosis (RO) differently. Experiments have found that the fouling layer structure for FO and RO is very different, but the reasons are not yet very clear, and hence a mechanistic understanding of the fouling in FO and RO is indispensable. Here we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize the nature of fouling in FO and RO. Lysozyme and layered graphene oxide (GO) were used as typical representatives of the model foulant and desalination membrane, respectively. It was found that protein-solvent and protein-ion interactions are at the core of the structural differences between RO and FO. In particular, we suggest hydration repulsion and charge screening as probable mechanisms, which lead to different fouling layer structures in FO and RO. Also, a probable mechanism of lysozyme adsorption on the GO surface is proposed, which is based on the transport of protein towards the surface due to hydraulic pressure and Coulombic interactions induced between basic residues of lysozyme (arginine, lysine) facing the surface and -rich functional groups present on the GO surface. Both hydraulic pressure and Coulombic interactions acted synergistically, which led to lysozyme adsorption on the GO surface. Furthermore, the effect of initial protein orientation on protein-membrane interaction was also explored and was found to be an important factor in determining the nature of interaction and the time scale within which an adsorption event could be observed. This study facilitates the current understanding of the fouling in FO and RO and provides a probable molecular mechanism of how fundamental forces such as hydration repulsion and electrostatic interaction make fouling structurally different in FO and RO.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659168>Targeted knock-in mice expressing the oxidase-fixed form of xanthine oxidoreductase favor tumor growth.</a></h2><p>Xanthine oxidoreductase has been implicated in cancer. Nonetheless, the role played by its two convertible forms, xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) and oxidase (XO) during tumorigenesis is not understood. Here we produce XDH-stable and XO-locked knock-in (ki) mice to address this question. After tumor transfer, XO ki mice show strongly increased tumor growth compared to wild type (WT) and XDH ki mice. Hematopoietic XO expression is responsible for this effect. After macrophage depletion, tumor growth is reduced. Adoptive transfer of XO-ki macrophages in WT mice increases tumor growth. In vitro, XO ki macrophages produce higher levels of reactive  species (ROS) responsible for the increased Tregs observed in the tumors. Blocking ROS in vivo slows down tumor growth. Collectively, these results indicate that the balance of XO/XDH plays an important role in immune surveillance of tumor development. Strategies that inhibit the XO form specifically may be valuable in controlling cancer growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660064>Current concepts of perioperative monitoring in high-risk surgical patients: a review.</a></h2><p>A substantial number of patients are at high-risk of intra- or post-operative complications or both. Most perioperative deaths are represented by patients who present insufficient physiological reserve to meet the demands of major surgery. Recognition and management of critical high-risk surgical patients require dedicated and effective teams, capable of preventing, recognize, start treatment with adequate support in time to refer patients to the satisfactory ICU level provision. The main task for health-care planners and managers is to identify and reduce this severe risk and to encourage patient's safety practices. Inadequate tissue perfusion and decreased cellular oxygenation due to hypovolemia, heart dysfunction, reduced cardiovascular reserve, and concomitant diseases are the most common causes of perioperative complications. Hemodynamic, respiratory and careful sequential monitoring have become essential aspects of the clinical practice both for surgeons and intensivists. New monitoring techniques have changed significantly over the past few years and are now able to rapidly identify shock states earlier, define the etiology, and monitor the response to different therapies. Many of these techniques are now minimally invasive or non-invasive. Advanced hemodynamic and respiratory monitoring combines invasive, non-invasive monitoring skills. Non-invasive ultrasound has emerged during the last years as an essential operative and perioperative evaluation tool, and its use is now rapidly growing. Perioperative management guided by appropriate sequential clinical evaluation combined with respiratory and hemodynamic monitoring is an established tool to help clinicians to identify those patients at higher risk in the attempt to reduce the complications rate and potentially improve patient outcomes. This review aims to provide an update of currently available standard concepts and evolving technologies of the various respiratory and hemodynamic monitoring systems for the high-risk surgical patients, highlighting their potential usefulness when integrated with careful clinical evaluation.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660070>Self-generating  enhanced mitochondrion-targeted photodynamic therapy for tumor treatment with hypoxia scavenging.</a></h2><p>Tumor hypoxia is an important reason for the limited therapeutic efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) because of the  requirement of the therapeutic process. PDT consumes tissue  and destroys tumor vasculature, further hampering its own efficacy in promoting tumor deterioration. Therefore, overcoming the photodynamic exacerbation of tumor hypoxia is urgent.  Herein, we report a photodynamic nanoparticle with sustainable hypoxia remission skills by both intratumoral HO catalysis and targeted mitochondrial destruction. The MnO@MSNs@IR780 nanoparticles are formed by absorbing a photosensitizer (IR780) into 90 nm mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and capping the surface pores with 5 nm MnO nanoparticles.  These MnO nanoparticles can accumulate in tumors and respond to the HO-enriched tumor microenvironment by decomposing and catalyzing HO into O. Afterwards, IR780 is released and activated, spontaneously targeting the mitochondria due to its natural mitochondrial affinity. Under laser irradiation, this self-generated -enhanced PDT can destroy mitochondria and inhibit cell respiration, resulting in sustainable hypoxia remission in tumor tissues and consequently enhancing the therapeutic outcome.  experiments suggest that MnO@MSNs@IR780 exhibited highly mitochondrion-targeted properties and could sustainably inhibit tumor hypoxia. Additionally, the highest photoacoustic signal of HbO with the lowest Hb was observed in tumors from mice after PDT, indicating that these nanoparticles can also prevent tumor hypoxia .  Taken together, our study indicated a new approach for overcoming the sustainable hypoxia limitation in traditional PDT by targeted  supplementation and mitochondria destruction.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656111>Nasal High Flow for Stable Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>There is a growing body of evidence supporting the use of nasal high flow (NHF) to treat acute respiratory failure, particularly in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients.

We identified randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of delivering air or   NHF, compared with delivering the same gas without NHF, in stable COPD patients through a systematic search using MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Science Direct, and others sources until January 2019. Study selection, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias (using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool) was performed by two independent authors. We included 6 studies (339 participants). Our meta-analysis showed a significant reduction of arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO) at long (two studies, MD -3 mmHg, [95% Confidence interval (CI) -4 to -2]) and short-term (two studies, MD -3 mmHg [95% CI -4 to -2]). NHF significantly improved quality of life on the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (two studies, MD -5 out of 100, [95% CI -8 to -2]). NHF significantly reduced the rate of acute exacerbation at 1 year (one study, rate ratio: 0.6, [95% CI 0.6 to 0.7]). NHF did not significantly improve exercise capacity, hospitalization rate or mortality, but improved breathing pattern. NHF reduced PaCO, acute exacerbation and improved quality of life in stable COPD patients.

The fresh and dry weight and the number of produced embryos were significantly decreased in response to Al concentration. At 150 mg.l, the embryo number decreased to 1.66 compared with the 19.33 in the control treatment. At high Al concentration (200 mg.l), the callus failed to produce any embryo. Biochemical analysis revealed that Al exposure had negative effect on callus. Total soluble carbohydrates, total soluble protein and free amino acids were decreased in plants receiving 200 mg.l Al treatment compared with those in the untreated ones. A similar decline was observed in total soluble protein and free amino acid in response to Al treatment. Significant accumulations of malondialdehyde, HO and peroxidase activity accompanied the increase in Al concentration in cultured tissues, revealing the generation of toxic reactive  species in affected cultures. The genotoxic effect of Al at high concentrations (150 and 200 mg.l) was revealed by protein patterns.Our findings revealed for the first time the phytotoxicity of Al to date palm callus. At 200 mg.l, Al prevented the embryo production of date palm callus. At 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg.l, Al negatively affected the biochemical characteristics of date palm callus. At 150 and 200 mg.l, Al induced changes in protein expression. These data showed that the tissue culture technique can be used as a valuable approach in heavy metal toxicity studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659561>Inhibition of PDE4 Attenuates TNF-α-Triggered Cell Death Through Suppressing NF-κB and JNK Activation in HT-22 Neuronal Cells.</a></h2><p>Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a critical pro-inflammatory cytokine regulating neuroinflammation. At high concentrations, it is toxic to neurons, and such damage is positively correlated with acute and chronic neurological diseases. Our previous studies showed that inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) attenuated the production of TNF-α induced by lipopolysaccharides in microglial cells. However, whether PDE4 inhibition can block the neurotoxic effects of TNF-α in neuronal cells is unknown. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of FCPR16, a novel PDE4 inhibitor, against TNF-α-induced cellular apoptosis in HT-22 hippocampal neuronal cells. We demonstrated that FCPR16 dose-dependently increased the viability of HT-22 cells exposed to TNF-α insult. Propidium iodide/calcein staining and flow cytometry analysis showed that FCPR16 decreased cell apoptosis triggered by TNF-α. Western blot analysis showed that FCPR16 decreased the level of cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 8, but had no effect on caspase 9. Mechanistically, FCPR16 blocked the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in HT-22 cells, and inhibition of JNK showed a similar protective effect as FCPR16. Furthermore, FCPR16 decreased the translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 from the cytosol into the nucleus. In addition, FCPR16 decreased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and the production of reactive  species in HT-22 cells exposed to TNF-α. Moreover, knockdown of PDE4B by specific small interfering RNA reduced the apoptosis of HT-22 cells treated with TNF-α. Taken together, our findings suggest that FCPR16 promotes the survival of neuronal cells exposed to TNF-α by suppressing the activation of JNK and NF-κB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659213>Central metabolism of functionally heterogeneous mesenchymal stromal cells.</a></h2><p>Metabolism and mitochondrial biology have gained a prominent role as determinants of stem cell fate and function. In the context of regenerative medicine, innovative parameters predictive of therapeutic efficacy could be drawn from the association of metabolic or mitochondrial parameters to different degrees of stemness and differentiation potentials. Herein, this possibility was addressed in human mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (hMSC) previously shown to differ in lifespan and telomere length. First, these hMSC were shown to possess significantly distinct proliferation rate, senescence status and differentiation capacity. More potential hMSC were associated to higher mitochondrial (mt) DNA copy number and lower mtDNA methylation. In addition, they showed higher expression levels of oxidative phosphorylation subunits. Consistently, they exhibited higher coupled  consumption rate and lower transcription of glycolysis-related genes, glucose consumption and lactate production. All these data pointed at oxidative phosphorylation-based central metabolism as a feature of higher stemness-associated hMSC phenotypes. Consistently, reduction of mitochondrial activity by complex I and III inhibitors in higher stemness-associated hMSC triggered senescence. Finally, functionally higher stemness-associated hMSC showed metabolic plasticity when challenged by glucose or glutamine shortage, which mimic bioenergetics switches that hMSC must undergo after transplantation or during self-renewal and differentiation. Altogether, these results hint at metabolic and mitochondrial parameters that could be implemented to identify stem cells endowed with superior growth and differentiation potential.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661571>High energy visible light at ambient doses and intensities induces oxidative stress of skin - Protective effects of the antioxidant and Nrf2 inducer Licochalcone A in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>Solar radiation causes skin damage through the generation of reactive  species (ROS). While UV filters effectively reduce UV-induced ROS, they cannot prevent VIS-induced (400 - 760 nm) oxidative stress. Therefore, potent antioxidants are needed as additives to sunscreen products.We investigated VIS-induced ROS formation and the photoprotective effects of the Nrf2-inducer Licochalcone A (LicA).VIS of 400-500 nm dose-dependently induced ROS in cultured human fibroblasts at doses equivalent to 1 hour of sunshine on a sunny summer day (150 J/cm ). A pretreatment for 24 hours with 1 µM LicA reduced ROS formation to the level of unirradiated cells while UV filters alone were ineffective, even at SPF50+. In vivo, topical treatment with a LicA-containing SPF50+ formulation significantly prevented the depletion of intradermal carotenoids by VIS irradiation while SPF50+ control did not protect.LicA may be a useful additive antioxidant for sunscreens.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

This study aimed to investigate whether cortical neuron-released exosomal microRNA-181c-3p (miR-181c-3p) affected ischemic brain injury (IBI).An IBI rat model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Astrocytes collected from rats were exposed to exosomes derived from cortical neurons to investigate the effect of exosomes on chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) expression and inflammatory response. Then, ectopic expression was induced in astrocytes treated with  and glucose deprivation (OGD).CXCL1 was identified to be an upregulated gene in IBI by microarray-based gene expression profiling. Additionally, upregulation of CXCL1 and promoted inflammatory response was also found in MCAO rats. miR-181c-3p was downregulated in OGD-treated cortical neurons and exosomes derived from OGD-treated cortical neurons. Exosomes derived from OGD-treated cortical neurons decreased the expression of CXCL1 and inflammatory factors in astrocytes, and exosomes delivered miR-181c-3p to decrease CXCL1 expression in astrocytes. CXCL1 was a target gene of miR-181c-3p. Delivery with miR-181c-3p mimic and siRNA against CXCL1 (si-CXCL1) was shown to inhibit inflammation in astrocytes by downregulating CXCL1.Collectively, exosomal miR-181c-3p derived from cortical neurons exerts protective effects on neuroinflammation in astrocytes via downregulation of CXCL1 in an IBI rat model.© 2019 S.

We examined sex differences in distinct components of  transport and utilization during exercise using linear and logistic regression models. The data were analyzed from June 2018 to May 2019.Resting and exercise gas exchange and hemodynamic parameters obtained during cardiopulmonary exercise testing.Of 295 participants, 121 (41.0%) were men (mean [SD] age, 64 [12] years) and 174 (59.0%) were women (mean [SD] age, 61 [13] years). Compared with men, women with HFpEF in this tertiary referral cohort had fewer comorbidities, including diabetes, insulin resistance, and hypertension, and a more favorable adipokine profile. Exercise capacity was similar in men and women (percent predicted peak  [O2] consumption: 66% in women vs 68% in men; P = .38), but women had distinct deficits in components of the O2 pathway, including worse biventricular systolic reserve (multivariable-adjusted analyses: ΔLVEF β = -1.70; SE, 0.86; P < .05; ΔRVEF β = -2.39, SE=0.80; P = .003), diastolic reserve (PCWP/CO: β = 0.63; SE, 0.31; P = .04), and peripheral O2 extraction (C(a-v)O2 β=-0.90, SE=0.22; P < .001)).Despite a lower burden of cardiometabolic disease and a similar percent predicted exercise capacity, women with HFpEF demonstrated greater cardiac and extracardiac deficits, including systolic reserve, diastolic reserve, and peripheral O2 extraction. These sex differences in cardiac and skeletal muscle responses to exercise may illuminate the pathophysiology underlying the development of HFpEF and should be investigated further.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659011>The small protein CydX is required for cytochrome  quinol oxidase stability and function in  Typhimurium: a phenotypic study.</a></h2><p>Cytochrome  quinol oxidases, which have greater affinity for  than heme-copper cytochrome oxidases (HCOs), promote bacterial respiration and fitness in low- environments such as host tissues. Here, we show that in addition to the CydA and CydB subunits, the small protein CydX is required for the assembly and function of the cytochrome  complex in the enteric pathogen  serovar Typhimurium. Mutant  Typhimurium lacking CydX showed loss of proper heme arrangement and impaired oxidase activity comparable to that of a  mutant lacking all cytochrome  subunits. Moreover, both the  mutant and the  mutant showed increased sensitivity to β-mercaptoethanol and nitric oxide (NO). Cytochrome -mediated protection from β-mercaptoethanol was not a result of resistance to reducing damage, but rather was due to cytochrome  oxidase managing  respiration while β-mercaptoethanol interacted with copper ions necessary for the HCO activity of the cytochrome type quinol oxidase. Interactions between NO and hemes in cytochrome - and cytochrome -dependent respiration during nitrosative stress indicated a direct role for cytochrome  in mediating  resistance to NO. Additionally, CydX was required for  Typhimurium proliferation inside macrophages. Mutants deficient in cytochrome , however, showed a significant increase in resistance to antibiotics, including aminoglycosides, D-cycloserine, and ampicillin. The essential role of CydX in cytochrome  assembly and function suggests that targeting this small protein could be a useful antimicrobial strategy, but potential drug tolerance responses should also be considered.Cytochrome  quinol oxidases, which are found only in bacteria, govern the fitness of many facultative anaerobic pathogens by promoting respiration in low- environments and by conferring resistance to antimicrobial radicals. Thus, cytochrome  complex assembly and activity are considered to be potential therapeutic targets. Here we report that the small protein CydX is required for the assembly and function of the cytochrome  complex in  Typhimurium under stress conditions, including exposure to β-mercaptoethanol, nitric oxide, or the phagocytic intracellular environment, demonstrating its crucial function for  fitness. However, cytochrome  inactivation also leads to increased resistance to some antibiotics, so considerable caution should be taken when developing therapeutic strategies targeting the CydX-dependent cytochrome .Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661834>Estimation of Biological Parameters of Cutaneous Ulcers Caused by Leishmaniasis in an Animal Model Using Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected tropical disease that requires novel tools for its understanding, diagnosis, and treatment follow-up. In the cases of other cutaneous pathologies, such as cancer or cutaneous ulcers due to diabetes, optical diffuse reflectance-based tools and methods are widely used for the investigation of those illnesses. These types of tools and methods offer the possibility to develop portable diagnosis and treatment follow-up systems. In this article, we propose the use of a three-layer diffuse reflectance model for the study of the formation of cutaneous ulcers caused by CL. The proposed model together with an inverse-modeling procedure were used in the evaluation of diffuse-reflectance spectral signatures acquired from cutaneous ulcers formed in the dorsal area of 21 golden hamsters inoculated with Leishmanisis braziliensis. As result, the quantification of the model's variables related to the main biological parameters of skin were obtained, such as: diameter and volumetric fraction of keratinocytes, collagen; volumetric fraction of hemoglobin, and  saturation. Those parameters show statistically significant differences among the different stages of the CL ulcer formation. We found that these differences are coherent with histopathological manifestations reported in the literature for the main phases of CL formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664781>Efficient Electrosynthesis of Syngas with Tunable CO/H2 Ratios over ZnxCd1-xS-Amine Inorganic-Organic Hybrids.</a></h2><p>Efficient electrochemical reduction of CO2-H2O into industrial syngas with tunable CO/H2 ratios, especially integrated with anodic organic synthesis to replace low-value  evolution reaction, is highly desirable. Here, integrating controllably partial substitution of zinc (Zn) with amine incorporation into CdS-amine inorganic-organic hybrids were designed as highly efficient electrocatalysts for synthesizing syngas with tunable CO/H2 ratios (0~19.7), which are important feedstock for Fischer-Tropsch process. Diethylenetriamine could enhance the adsorption and accelerate the activation of CO2 to form the key intermediate COOH* for CO formation.

These detrimental environmental factors enhanced the ROS production such as singlet  (O), superoxide (O ), hydrogen peroxide (HO) and hydroxyl radicals (OH). ROS are highly reactive and directly target several cellular molecules and metabolites, which lead to severe cellular dysfunction. Plants respond to oxidative damages by activating antioxidant machinery to trigger signalling cascades for stress tolerance. HO signalling balances the plant metabolism through cross-talk with other signals and plant hormones during growth, development and stress responses. HO facilitates the regulation of different stress-responsive transcription factors (TFs) including NAC, Zinc finger, WRKY, ERF, MYB, DREB and bZIP as both upstream and downstream events during stress signalling. The present review focuses on the biological synthesis of the HO and its effect on the upregulation of kinase genes and stress related TFs for imparting stress tolerance.© King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657411>Free volume, gas permeation, and proton conductivity in MIL-101-SOH/Nafion composite membranes.</a></h2><p>A series of MIL-101-SO3H/Nafion composite membranes was synthesized. They show an improved proton conductivity, due to the abundance of SO3H groups, which fosters proton conduction by binding the water molecules and enabling a larger number of conducting sites. Gas (including water vapor, hydrogen, and ) permeability, crystallinity, and free volumes of the MIL-101-SO3H/Nafion composite membranes were investigated, as well as their correlation. By increasing the MIL-101-SO3H content, the gas permeability of the membranes significantly decreases, since the crystalline region is larger and the water-bearing MIL-101-SO3H particles are efficient barriers for the gas molecules. The gas permeation in the composite membranes is a very complex process and the results indicate no simple linear relation between the gas permeability and the free volume size (VFV), or between the gas permeability and the crystallinity. Moreover, it is very interesting to observe that the influence of VFV on the gas permeability is closely related to the size of the particular gas molecules: the larger the size of the gas molecules, the larger the free volume needed to achieve their rapid diffusion in the membrane. The results suggest the presence of a threshold value for VFV, which depends on the size of the gas molecules: when VFV is lower than this value, the gas molecules cannot easily jump through neighboring free volumes to a neighboring site, and, as a result, the permeability drops quickly.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656096>Leptin Restores Endothelial Function via Endothelial PPARγ-Nox1-Mediated Mechanisms in a Mouse Model of Congenital Generalized Lipodystrophy.</a></h2><p>Leptin is the current treatment for metabolic disorders associated with acquired and congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL). Although excess leptin levels have been associated with vascular inflammation and cardiovascular disease in the context of obesity, the effects of chronic leptin treatment on vascular function remain unknown in CGL. Here, we hypothesized that leptin treatment will improve endothelial function via direct vascular mechanisms. We investigated the cardiovascular consequences of leptin deficiency and supplementation in male gBscl2 ( gene-deficient) mice-a mouse model of CGL. CGL mice exhibited reduced adipose mass and leptin levels, as well as impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation. Blood vessels from CGL mice had increased NADPH Oxidase 1 (Nox1) expression and reactive  species production, and selective Nox1 inhibition restored endothelial function. Remarkably, chronic and acute leptin supplementation restored endothelial function via a PPARγ-dependent mechanism that decreased Nox1 expression and reactive  species production. Selective ablation of leptin receptors in endothelial cells promoted endothelial dysfunction, which was restored by Nox1 inhibition. Lastly, we confirmed in aortic tissue from older patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery that acute leptin can promote signaling in human blood vessels. In conclusion, in gBscl2 mice, leptin restores endothelial function via peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma-dependent decreases in Nox1. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that vessels from aged patients remain leptin sensitive. These data reveal a new direct role of leptin receptors in the control of vascular homeostasis and present leptin as a potential therapy for the treatment of vascular disease associated with low leptin levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663549>Theoretical investigations of a platinum-water interface using quantum-mechanics-molecular-mechanics based molecular dynamics simulations.</a></h2><p>Pt-water interfaces have been of immense interest in the field of energy storage and conversion. Studying this interface using both experimental and theoretical tools is challenging. On the theoretical front, typically one uses classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to handle large system sizes or time scales while for a more accurate quantum mechanical description Born Oppenheimer MD (BOMD) is typically used. The latter is limited to smaller system sizes and time-scales. In this study using quantum-mechanics-molecular-mechanics (QMMM), we have performed atomistic MD simulations to have a microscopic understanding of the structure of the Pt-water interface using a system size that is much larger than that accessible when using BOMD simulations. In contrast to recent reports using BOMD simulations, our study reveals that the water molecules typically form two distinct layers above the Pt-surface before they form bulk like structures. Further, we also find that a significant fraction of the water molecules at the interface are pointed towards the surface thereby disrupting the H-bond network. Consistent with this observation, the layer resolved - radial distribution function for the water molecules belonging to the solvating water layer shows a high density liquid like behaviour even though the overall water behaves like a low density liquid. A charge transfer analysis reveals that this solvating water layer donates electrons to the Pt atoms in contact with it thereby resulting in the formation of an interface dipole that is pointing towards the surface. Our results suggest that, using QMMM-MD, on one hand it is possible to study more realistic models of solid-liquid interfaces that are inaccessible with BOMD, while on the other hand one also has access to information about such systems that are not obtained from conventional classical MD simulations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665070>The effect of low dose marine protein hydrolysates on short-term recovery after high intensity performance cycling: a double-blinded crossover study.</a></h2><p>Knowledge of the effect of marine protein hydrolysate (MPH) supplementation to promote recovery after high intensity performance training is scarce. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of MPH supplementation to whey protein (WP) and carbohydrate (CHO): (CHO-WP-MPH), on short-term recovery following high intensity performance, compared to an isoenergetic and isonitrogenous supplement of WP and CHO: (CHO-WP), in male cyclists.This was a double-blinded crossover study divided into three phases. Fourteen healthy men participated. In phase I, an incremental bicycle exercise test was performed for establishment of intensities used in phase II and III. In phase II (9-16 days after phase 1), the participants performed first one high intensity performance cycling session, followed by nutrition supplementation (CHO-WP-MPH or CHO-WP) and 4 hours of recovery, before a subsequent high intensity performance cycling session. Phase III (1 week after phase II), was similar to phase II except for the nutrition supplementation, where the participants received the opposite supplementation compared to phase II.

In this study, normal-like developmental phenotype was observed in both cox17Δ6 and cox17Δ4 homozygous zebrafish mutants, while gene ontology term and pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes in both mutants showed enrichment in oxidoreductase activity, ion transport, histone methylation, MICOS complex, Wnt signaling, etc. This implied the occurrence of damage to the integral function of Cox17 and change of transcriptomes in the two mutants. Further qRT-PCR and WISH assays revealed the down-regulated expression of Wnt signaling and reduced expression of swim bladder marker genes in the two mutants. Moreover, copper stimulation induced no obvious increase in reactive  species (ROS) or in the expression of hemoglobin marker genes, but further reduced the expression of swim bladder marker genes in the mutants. The integral data in this study suggest that: (1) cox17 mutants cannot activate the response of oxidoreductase to copper stimulation; (2) copper depends on the integral function of Cox17 to induce developmental defects in hemoglobin rather than swim bladder and (3) Wnt signaling but not ROS might mediate copper-induced swim bladder developmental defects in fish.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Oxidized nucleotides such as 2'-deoxyribo-5-hydroxyuridin (HdU) and 2'-deoxyribo-5-hydroxymethyluridin (HMdU) can be inserted into DNA during replication and repair. HdU and HMdU have attracted particular interest because they have different effects on damaged-DNA processing enzymes that control the downstream effects of the lesions. Herein, we studied the chemically simulated translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) across the lesions formed by HdU or HMdU using microscale thermophoresis (MST). The thermodynamic changes associated with replication across HdU or HMdU show that the HdU paired with the mismatched deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates disturbs DNA duplexes considerably less than thymidine (dT) or HMdU. Moreover, we also demonstrate that TLS by DNA polymerases across the lesion derived from HdU was markedly less extensive and potentially more mutagenic than that across the lesion formed by HMdU. Thus, DNA polymerization by DNA polymerase η (polη), the exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (KF), and reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1 RT) across these pyrimidine lesions correlated with the different stabilization effects of the HdU and HMdU in DNA duplexes revealed by MST. The equilibrium thermodynamic data obtained by MST can explain the influence of the thermodynamic alterations on the ability of DNA polymerases to bypass lesions induced by oxidative products of pyrimidines.

Asthmatic subgroups with different clinical phenotypes and needing long-term tiotropium as a maintenance treatment are identified. The effectiveness of tiotropium add-on therapy is defined as an improvement of ACT score ≥3 points 3 months after the treatment ( baseline), while the long-term requirement of tiotropium is defined as tiotropium dependency >1 year.The study analyzed a total of 160 uncontrolled asthmatics regardless of low- or medium-to-high-dose ICS plus LABA. One hundred and twelve patients responded well (ACT score increased ≥3 points) to tiotropium. These patients were further divided into two subgroups: one with tiotropium add-on therapy for ≥1 year due to patients' difficulties in stepping down from tiotropium; the other with tiotropium add-on therapy for <1 year due to successful step-down treatment according to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) score. All clinical characteristics of these two groups were collected and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that asthma-and-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-overlap (ACO), initial forced expiratory volume-one second (FEV1) % predicted <80%, or body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m were predictors for asthmatics requiring long-term tiotropium add-on therapy.Tiotropium add-on therapy is effective for uncontrolled asthmatics. Moreover, patients with ACO, initial FEV1% predicted <80%, or BMI >30 kg/m require long-term tiotropium add-on therapy for asthma control.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

ROS play an important role in tumor development and metastasis. Excessive ROS can induce tumor cell apoptosis and inhibit tumor cell metastasis. This study investigated Fenton-reaction-stimulative nanoparticles (P@P/H NPs) containing ROS-responsive molecular switches for antitumor metastasis by amplifying the ROS and activating the cascade biological reaction of ROS in tumor cells. Spheroidal P@P/H NPs exhibited a uniform size of 68.18 ± 0.29 nm, high drug cumulative release of 97.59% in response to H2O2 at 24 h, and satisfactory cytotoxicity with the IC50 value of 0.50 ± 0.02 μg mL-1. The markedly elevated ROS level caused by P@P/H NPs generated an evident antitumor metastasis effect in vitro by facilitating the expressions of cytochrome c, caspase-9, and caspase-3 and blocking that of matrix metalloprotein 9 (MMP-9). Moreover, P@P/H NPs engendered an excellent tumor inhibition rate of 56.37% and antitumor metastasis effect in vivo. Therefore, P@P/H NPs could respond to H2O2 in tumor cells to rapidly disassemble and further increase the ROS to induce antitumor metastasis via the Fenton reaction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659628>CCN1 triggers adaptive autophagy in cardiomyocytes to curb its apoptotic activities.</a></h2><p>Autophagy occurs at basal levels for cellular homeostasis under normal conditions and is increased in response to nutrient starvation or stress to ensure cell survival. However, excessive autophagy can be deleterious to cardiomyocytes. CCN1/Cyr61, a matricellular protein, is expressed in the stressed heart to induce cardiomyopathy. The role of autophagy in CCN1-associated cardiotoxicity was not clear. Here, we found that autophagy was induced in the myocardium of the isoproterenol (ISO; 100 mg/kg/day for 5 days; s.c.) treated mice, where CCN1 expression is colocalized. The knock-in mice carrying an integrin α6β1-binding-defective mutant allele Ccn1-dm were resistant to the ISO-induced cardiac injury and autophagy. Our in vitro studies demonstrated that CCN1 dose- and time-dependently induced GFP-LC3-labeled autophagosome formation in rat cardiomyoblast H9c2 cells. The formation of autolysosomes in response to CCN1 (5 μg/ml; 3 h) treatment was identified by the acridine orange staining. The autophagy induction was confirmed by the elevated protein levels of Beclin 1, Atg5, and LC3-II, and the decrease of p62. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine or by silencing Atg5 gene enabled CCN1-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells, suggesting a protective role of autophagy. CCN1 binds to integrin α6β1 to induce autophagy through reactive  species, and the activation of ERK and JNK. Furthermore, mitophagy was observed after CCN1 treatment for the clearance of depolarized mitochondria. Together, these results demonstrated that autophagy is induced in response to CCN1/α6β1 signaling in cardiomyocytes to alleviate CCN1-associated cardiotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661638>Fluorofenidone protects against acute kidney injury.</a></h2><p>Cisplatin (CP) is one of the most effective chemotherapeutics in the treatment of human cancers. However, the beneficial effects of CP are limited by the toxic effects, especially nephrotoxicity. Fluorofenidone (AKFPD) is a promising multifunctional antifibrosis pyridinone drug discovered by our group. But there is no evidence of its protective effects against acute kidney injury (AKI). Therefore, we investigated the protective effects of AKFPD on CP-induced AKI  and . Compared with the model group, treatment with AKFPD effectively ameliorated kidney damages. In order to elucidate the mechanisms, we discovered that AKFPD treatment notably alleviated generation of reactive  species, reduced the phosphorylation levels of MAPKs (ERK1 and 2, JNKs, and p38), suppressed inflammatory response, inhibited apoptosis, and abated the expression of CP transporters (organic cation transporter 2 and copper transport protein 1) compared with the model group. Moreover, because renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI)-induced AKI and LPS-induced AKI are the major models representative of renal transplantation-correlated AKI and sepsis-related AKI, which are also the main causes of AKI, we have also proved the effectiveness of AKFPD on these models. In conclusion, these findings suggest that AKFPD is a potent drug for CP-, IRI-, and LPS-caused AKI and elucidate the underlying mechanism.-Jiang, Y., Quan, J., Chen, Y., Liao, X., Dai, Q., Lu, R., Yu, Y., Hu, G., Li, Q., Meng, J., Xie, Y., Peng, Z., Tao, L.

HA is widely used in agriculture but is known to have therapeutic properties, which are still poorly explored. Previous studies have shown the potential of biotechnological processes in the production of HA in submerged fermentation (SF) and solid-state fermentation (SSF) using pre-treated fibers of oil palm of empty fruit bunch (EFB) for the cultivation of  strains. EFB is an agro-industrial residue that is readily available at a low cost. The present study aimed to study the production of HA by  in the SSF of raw fibers of EFBs from two different palm oil producers. Profiles of HA production, cellular protein, pH, glucose, moisture, and  transfer were obtained during SSF by EFB with and without lipids, as well as, images by electron microscopy of fibers. Results showed efficient HA production in the raw fibers of the EFBs. HA production followed the cellular protein (6 g HA per 100 g of fibers) evolution of the fermentations in the absence of lipids, while the composition of lipids greatly affected its production. The best HA production (350 mg HA per 100 g of fibers) was obtained from EFB that was richer in lignocellulosics and the residual lipids were similar to the fractions of palm and kernel oils, while EFB with lower lignocellulosic presented a production 110 mg HA per 100 g of fibers.© King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656081>Do we have simple and accurate predictors of health outcomes in apparently healthy populations other than estimated peak  uptake?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664027>Constraining the rise of  with  isotopes.</a></h2><p>After permanent atmospheric oxygenation, anomalous sulfur isotope compositions were lost from sedimentary rocks, demonstrating that atmospheric chemistry ceded its control of Earth's surficial sulfur cycle to weathering. However, mixed signals of anoxia and oxygenation in the sulfur isotope record between 2.5 to 2.3 billion years (Ga) ago require independent clarification, for example via  isotopes in sulfate. Here we show <2.31 Ga sedimentary barium sulfates (barites) from the Turee Creek Basin, W. Australia with positive sulfur isotope anomalies of ∆S up to + 1.55‰ and low δO down to -19.5‰. The unequivocal origin of this combination of signals is sulfide oxidation in meteoric water. Geochemical and sedimentary evidence suggests that these S-isotope anomalies were transferred from the paleo-continent under an oxygenated atmosphere.

The molecular mechanisms leading to RPE dysfunction in response to ROS are unclear. Here, human stem cell-derived RPE samples were stressed with ROS for 1 or 3 weeks, and both intracellular and secreted proteomes were quantified by mass spectrometry. ROS increased glycolytic proteins but decreased mitochondrial complex I subunits, as well as membrane proteins required for endocytosis. RPE secreted over 1,000 proteins, many of which changed significantly due to ROS. Notably, secreted APOE is decreased 4-fold, and urotensin-II, the strongest known vasoconstrictor, doubled. Furthermore, secreted TGF-beta is increased, and its cognate signaler BMP1 decreased in the secretome.

Massive and cost-effective production and efficient recovery of carbon-based catalysts are crucial to apply this technology. However, various nanostructured carbons with different dimensions are usually utilized as precursors while not considering their complex preparation procedures and the high costs of ingredients. Moreover, catalyst separation and recovery are not given sufficient attention. In this work, a calcium salt - assisted pyrolysis strategy is proposed to tune the catalytic site formation of carbon-based catalysts. Results show that blending equal amounts of Ca2+ (calcium chloride) and organic precursors could greatly improve the catalytic activity of the carbonated product to activate peroxymonosulfate for pollutant degradation. In addition, the proposed synthetic strategy is universal to most of the readily accessed and cost-effective organic precursors. Singlet  is identified as the main reactive oxidant for pollutant removal in the catalytic reaction. By crosslinking calcium ion and alginate as a hydrogel to immobilize the catalyst, the carbon material could be readily recovered. Furthermore, a long-term continuous-flow reactor test is conducted to validate the effectiveness of applying the immobilized catalyst to treat a synthetic wastewater with 0.5-mM bisphenol A. As a result, a green synthesis and immobilization strategy for persulfate catalysts is successfully established, and the prepared catalyst might be applied for wastewater treatment through using calcium salt in two purposes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657228>Nitric Oxide-Dependent Protein Posttranslational Modifications Impair Mitochondrial Function and Metabolism to Contribute to Neurodegenerative Diseases.</a></h2><p>Most brains affected by neurodegenerative diseases manifest mitochondrial dysfunction as well as elevated production of reactive  and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), contributing to synapse loss and neuronal injury. Recent Advances: Excessive production of RNS triggers nitric oxide (NO)-mediated posttranslational modifications of proteins, such as S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues and nitration of tyrosine residues. Proteins thus affected impair mitochondrial metabolism, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitophagy in the nervous system.Identification and better characterization of underlying molecular mechanisms for NO-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction will provide important insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we highlight recent discoveries concerning S-nitrosylation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, mitochondrial fission GTPase Drp1, and mitophagy-related proteins Parkin and PINK1.

However, among them, many DDSs are unable to realize rapid and sufficient drug release since most internal-stimulants might be consumed during the release process. To address the plight, abundant supply of stimulants is highly desirable. Herein, a core crosslinked pullulan-di-(4,1-hydroxybenzylene) diselenide (Pu-HBSe) nanosystem, which could generate abundant exogenous-stimulant reactive--species (ROS) via tumor-specific NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) catalysis, was constructed by the encapsulation of β-Lapachone. The enzyme-catalytic generated ROS induced self-triggered cascade amplification release of loaded doxorubicin (DOX) in the tumor cells, thus achieved efficient delivery of DOX to nuclei of tumor cells by breaking the diselenide bond of nanosystem. As a result, the anti-tumor effect of this nanosystem was significantly improved on HepG2 xenograft model. In general, this study offers a new paradigm of utilizing interaction between loaded agent and carrier in the tumor cells to obtain self-triggered drug release in the design of DDSs for enhanced cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664147>Leucine-rich diet induces a shift in tumour metabolism from glycolytic towards oxidative phosphorylation, reducing glucose consumption and metastasis in Walker-256 tumour-bearing rats.</a></h2><p>Leucine can stimulate protein synthesis in skeletal muscle, and recent studies have shown an increase in leucine-related mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation capacity in muscle cells. However, leucine-related effects in tumour tissues are still poorly understood. Thus, we described the effects of leucine in both in vivo and in vitro models of a Walker-256 tumour. Tumour-bearing Wistar rats were randomly distributed into a control group (W; normoprotein diet) and leucine group (LW; leucine-rich diet [normoprotein + 3% leucine]). After 20 days of tumour evolution, the animals underwent -fludeoxyglucose positron emission computed tomography (F-FDG PET-CT) imaging, and after euthanasia, fresh tumour biopsy samples were taken for  consumption rate measurements (Oroboros Oxygraph), electron microscopy analysis and RNA and protein extraction. Our main results from the LW group showed no tumour size change, lower tumour glucose (F-FDG) uptake, and reduced metastatic sites. Furthermore, leucine stimulated a shift in tumour metabolism from glycolytic towards oxidative phosphorylation, higher mRNA and protein expression of oxidative phosphorylation components, and enhanced mitochondrial density/area even though the leucine-treated tumour had a higher number of apoptotic nuclei with increased oxidative stress. In summary, a leucine-rich diet directed Walker-256 tumour metabolism to a less glycolytic phenotype profile in which these metabolic alterations were associated with a decrease in tumour aggressiveness and reduction in the number of metastatic sites in rats fed a diet supplemented with this branched-chain amino acid.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663600>Neutrophil Extracellular Traps are Present in Immune-complex-mediated Cutaneous Small Vessel Vasculitis and Correlate with the Production of Reactive  Species and the Severity of Vessel Damage.</a></h2><p>Formation of neutrophil extracellular traps has been implicated in autoimmunity. However, the presence and clinical relevance of neutrophil extracellular traps in immune-complex-mediated cutaneous small and medium vessel vasculitides has not been investigated. This study retrospectively analysed 43 patients with histology-proven hypersensitivity vasculitis (n = 21), IgA vasculitis (n = 22), urticarial vasculitis (n = 22), erythema elevatum diutinum (n = 3) and polyarteritis nodosa (n = 4). Neutrophil extracellular traps were detected in hypersensitivity vasculitis, IgA vasculitis, urticarial vasculitis and erythema elevatum diutinum, but not in polyarteritis nodosa lesions. Neutrophil extracellular traps were found around inflamed vessels, and their formation was highest upon early onset of vasculitis, and decreased progressively. Neutrophil extracellular traps were strongly correlated with the histological severity of vasculitis and the production of reactive  species. Both hypersensitivity vasculitis and IgA vasculitis showed significantly more neutrophil extracellular traps than did urticarial vasculitis, independent of the histological severity and duration of vasculitis. These results provide evidence on the implication of neutrophil extracellular traps in the early phases of immune-complex-mediated small vessel vasculitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663166>Mono-Heteroatom Harnessing Excited-state Structural Planarization for Dihydrodibenzo[a,c] phenazines.</a></h2><p>In an aim to generalize the structure-properties relationship of bending heterocyclic molecules that undergo prominent photoinduced structural planarization (PISP), a series of new dihydrodibenzo[ a,c ]phenazine derivatives with one nitrogen atom (N) replaced with  ( PNO ), sulfur ( PNS ), selenium ( PNSe ) and dimethylmethanediyl ( PNC ) moieties were strategically designed and synthesized.  PNO , PNS and PNSe reveal significant nonplanar geometries in the ground state, which undergoes PISP, yielding a planar-like conformer hence a large Stokes-shifted emission. The combination of femtosecond early relaxation dynamics and computational approaches establish a R*→ I* (intermediate) → P* sequential kinetic pattern for PNS and PNSe , while differently PNO undergoes R*→ P* one-step kinetics. The polarization ability of the substituted heterosubstituted atoms, being in the order of O < S < Se, correlates their increase of p-conjugation and hence the Stokes shift of the emission, being in the order of PNO < PNS < PNSe . PNSe with largest PISP barrier was proven to be a highly sensitive viscosity probe.  The results lead us to conclude that PISP is ubiquitous in dihydrodibenzo[ a,c ]phenazines, for which the driving force is to elongate the p-delocalization, gaining stabilization in the excited-state.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Exposure to DEHP impairs the function of islet beta cells (INS-1 cells), which is related to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. At present, some research data have also confirmed that MEHP has a certain damage effect on INS-1 cells. In our experiment, we found that MEHP would lead to the increase of reactive  species (ROS) and the upregulation of autophagy. And downregulated ROS production by -acetyl-l-cysteine could also reduce autophagy. In addition, MEHP-induced lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) subsequently released cathepsin D. Additionally, MEHP induced the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and release of cytochrome . Addition of autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine relieved MEHP-induced apoptosis as assessed by the expression of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 9, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, indicating that MEHP-induced apoptosis was autophagy dependent. Cathepsin D inhibitor, pepstatin A, suppressed MEHP-induced mitochondria release of cytochrome  and apoptosis as well. Meanwhile, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a new B vitamin, improved the above phenomenon. Taken together, our results indicate that MEHP induces autophagy-dependent apoptosis in INS-1 cells by lysosomal-mitochondrial axis. PQQ improved this process by downregulating ROS and provided a degree of protection. Our study provides a new perspective for MEHP on the cytotoxic mechanism and PQQ protection in INS-1 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662268>Levels, spatial distribution, and source identification of airborne environmentally persistent free radicals from tree leaves.</a></h2><p>Environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) are receiving increasing concern due to their toxicity and ubiquity in the environment. To avoid restrictions imposed when using a high-volume active sampler, this study uses tree leaves to act as passive samplers to investigate the spatial distribution characteristics and sources of airborne EPFRs. Tree leaf samples were collected from 120 sites in five areas around China (each approximately 4 km × 4 km). EPFR concentrations in particles (<2 μm) on the surface of 110 leaf samples were detected, ranging from 7.5 × 10 to 4.5 × 10 spins/g. For the 10 N.D. samples, they were all collected from areas inaccessible by vehicles. The g-values of EPFRs on 68% leaf samples were larger than 2.004, suggesting the electron localized on the  atom, and they were consistent with the road dust sample (g-value: 2.0042). Significant positive correlation was found between concentrations of elemental carbon (tracer of vehicle emissions) and EPFRs. Spatial distribution mapping showed that EPFR levels in various land uses differed noticeably. Although previous work has linked atmospheric EPFRs to waste incineration, the evidence in this study suggests that vehicle emissions, especially from heavy-duty vehicles, are the main sources. While waste incinerators with low emissions or effective dust-control devices might not be an important EPFR contributor. According to our estimation, over 90% of the EPFRs deposited on tree leaves might be attributed to automotive exhaust emissions, as a synergistic effect of primary exhausts and degradation of aromatic compounds in road dust. With adding the trapping agent into the particle samples (<2 μm), signals of hydroxyl radicals were observed. This indicates that EPFRs collected from this phytosampling method can lead to the release of reactive  species (ROS) once they are inhaled by human beings. Thus, this study helps highlight EPFR "hotspots" for potential health risk identification.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although previous studies have reported the biological activity of KAE on a variety of cells, it is not clear whether KAE plays a similar role in oocyte and embryo in vitro culture systems. This study investigated the effect of KAE addition to in vitro maturation on the antioxidant capacity of embryos in porcine oocytes after parthenogenetic activation. The effects of kaempferol on oocyte quality in porcine oocytes were studied based on the expression of related genes, reactive  species, glutathione and mitochondrial membrane potential as criteria. The rate of blastocyst formation was significantly higher in oocytes treated with 0.1 µm KAE than in control oocytes. The mRNA level of the apoptosis-related gene Caspase-3 was significantly lower in the blastocysts derived from KAE-treated oocytes than in the control group and the mRNA expression of the embryo development-related genes COX2 and SOX2 was significantly increased in the KAE-treated group compared with that in the control group. Furthermore, the level of intracellular reactive  species was significantly decreased and that of glutathione was significantly increased after KAE treatment. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was increased and the activity of Caspase-3 was significantly decreased in the KAE-treated group compared with that in the control group. Taken together, these results suggested that KAE is beneficial for the improvement of embryo development by inhibiting oxidative stress in porcine oocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657199>Multicolor fluorescence based on FRET regulated by functional peptides to screen high metastatic potential cancer cells.</a></h2><p>The activation and execution of cancer invasion and metastasis involves in a complex network of intracellular, extracellular molecule levels (such as reactive  species, ROS, matrix metalloproteinase, MMPs) and signaling cascades. Obviously, fluorescence sensing is a powerful detection tool for the analytes. However, for imaging the intracellular signal cascades involved multiple molecules, traditional fluorescence probes were unsuitable, because most of them only can determine the change of only species, rather than response multiple species simultaneously. Herein, we constructed a novel probe: H2O2 responding fluorophore donor was linked by MMP2-sensitive peptides tagged a FRET Cy5 acceptor. Upon addition of H2O2, the system was lighted with green fluorescence emission (555 nm), further triggering a brighter red fluorescent emission (672 nm, belong to Cy5 acceptor), owing to FRET. In contrast, in the prescence of MMP2, the FRET was turned off, due to special cleavage of the peptide linker. The stimulation with H2O2 made probe-loaded living cells emit multicolor fluorescence: mainly red fluorescence in normal RAW264.7 cells and poorly-invasive MCF7 cells; only green fluorescence in highly-invasive MDA-MA-231 cells, owing to different expression of MMP2. This means that after activation of H2O2, probe can be used to distinguish MDA-MA-231 cells from RAW264.7 macrophages and MCF7 cells. Therefore, so multicolor fluorescent probe is a powerful tool in monitoring cancer invasion and metastasis, which will provide precision information for cancer control and cure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661365>Phytotoxic effect of silver nanoparticles on seed germination and growth of terrestrial plants.</a></h2><p>Silver nanoparticles (AgNP) exhibit size and concentration dependent toxicity to terrestrial plants, especially crops. AgNP exposure could decrease seed germination, inhibit seedling growth, affect mass and length of roots and shoots. The phytotoxic pathway has been partly understood. Silver (as element, ion or AgNP) accumulates in roots/leaves and triggers the defense mechanism at cellular and tissue levels, which alters metabolism, antioxidant activities and related proteomic expression. Botanical changes (either increase or decrease) in response to AgNP exposure include reactive  species generation, superoxide dismutase activities, HO level, total chlorophyll, proline, carotenoid, ascorbate and glutathione contents, etc. Such processes lead to abnormal morphological changes, suppression of photosynthesis and/or transpiration, and other symptoms.

This review describes the processes that lead to seed deterioration, including loss of seed protection capacity against reactive  species (ROS), damage to the plasma membrane, consumption of reserves, and damage to genetic material. A hypothesis of how seed deterioration occurs was also addressed; in this hypothesis, seed deterioration was divided into three phases. The first is the beginning of deterioration, with a slight reduction of vigor caused by the reactions of reducing sugars with antioxidant enzymes and genetic material. In the second, the cell shows oxidative damages, causing lipid peroxidation, which leads to the leaching of solutes, the formation of malondialdehyde, and, consequently, an increase in damages to genetic material. In the third phase, there is cell collapse with mitochondrial membrane deconstruction and a high accumulation of reactive  species, malondialdehyde, and reducing sugars.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Cardiac dimensions were assessed by echocardiographic examination at rest. Peak  uptake was obtained by a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill.Circulating levels of analysed hormones at rest did not differ between the groups. A correlation was found between increased cardiac dimensions and IGF-1 in the controls, but not in the active group. This correlation declined also among the controls when the cardiac parameters were indexed for body surface area.Increased cardiac dimensions in endurance-trained adolescents could not be related to resting levels of hormones associated with growth and metabolism, including IGF-1 and GH. In addition, the resting levels of these hormones seem not to be affected by intense regular endurance exercise in adolescents. These findings may contribute to the knowledge about cellular signaling that trigger growth as well as cardiac adaptation to endurance training in young athletes.Copyright © 2019 Louise Rundqvist et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657417>Electronic modulation of composite electrocatalysts derived from layered NiFeMn triple hydroxide nanosheets for boosted overall water splitting.</a></h2><p>Herein, we report the synthesis of Fe and Mn co-doped Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays (FM-NS NSAs) as well as layered NiFeMn triple hydroxide (NiFeMn-LTH)/FM-NS hybrid NSAs (HNSAs) via an easily controllable sulfidation method with NiFeMn-LTH NSAs as the precursor, which can be employed as coupled  evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrodes to achieve boosted overall water splitting performance.

As a result, the full sulfidation product of FM-NS NSAs display a much-enhanced activity for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 with an overpotential of 188 mV. The NiFeMn-LTH/FM-NS HNSAs obtained from partial sulfidation demonstrate an enhanced HER activity with a lower overpotential of 110 mV at 10 mA cm-2. The FM-NS NSA anode and the NiFeMn-LTH/FM-NS HNSA cathode were coupled in an alkaline medium for overall water splitting and exhibited a much lower cell voltage of 1.48 V at 10 mA cm-2, superior to most of the reported noble-metal-free electrocatalysts.

Recent observational research has suggested a relationship between RBC death (eryptosis) and hypoxemia in hemodialysis patients. Thus, we studied the isolated and joint effects of a uremic toxin (indoxyl sulfate; IS) and hypoxia on RBC biology.We incubated RBC from healthy donors with IS at concentrations of 0.01mM, 0.09mM and 0.17mM under both normoxic (21% O) and hypoxic (5% O) conditions for 24 hours. Eryptosis was evaluated by RBC phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, cell volume, and cytosolic calcium which were quantified by Annexin-V+, forward scatter, and Fluo-3AM+ binding, respectively. RBC redox balance was reported by reactive  species (ROS) production and intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH). Analyses were performed by flow cytometry.Hypoxia induced a 2-fold ROS production compared to normoxia. PS exposure and cytosolic calcium increased, while cell volume decreased by hypoxia and likewise by IS. IS increased ROS production in a dose-dependent manner under conditions of both normoxia and hypoxia. The same conditions promoted a GSH decrease with IS intensifying the hypoxia-induced effects.In summary, our results indicate that the concurrent presence of hypoxia and uremia augments RBC death and may therefore, contribute to the genesis of anemia in CKD.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Vitamin-C (VitC), in addition to suppressing  radicals, exerts pleiotropic effects to preserve the core functions of SCs. However, this compound is labile and readily oxidized, resulting in cellular toxicity and preventing its reliable application in this context. We found that a VitC derivative, ascorbic acid 2-glucoside (AA2G), stably maintains the naïve pluripotency of murine embryonic-SCs (mESCs) and the primitiveness of human mesenchymal-SCs (hMSCs) without cellular toxicity.The beneficial effects of AA2G and related molecular mechanisms were evaluated in mESCs, induced pluripotent SCs (iPSCs), and hMSCs. AA2G was stable in aqueous solution and barely induced cellular toxicity in cultured SCs, unlike VitC. AA2G supplementation recapitulated the well-known effects of VitC, including induction of ten-eleven translocation (TET)-dependent DNA demethylation in mESCs and suppression of p53 during generation of murine iPSCs. Furthermore, supplementation of hMSCs with AA2G improved therapeutic outcomes in an asthma mouse model by promoting their self-renewal, engraftment, and anti-inflammatory properties. Particularly, activation of the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-1 (CREB1) pathway contributed to the ability of AA2G to maintain naïve pluripotency of mESCs and functionality of hMSCs. Innovation and Conclusion: Given its long-lasting effects and low cellular toxicity, AA2G supplementation is useful to support the naïve pluripotency of mESCs and the primitiveness of hMSCs, which affects their developmental potency and therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the significance of the CREB1 pathway in the mechanism of action of AA2G.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664750>Unconventional Route to  Vacancies-Enabled Highly Efficient Electron Extraction and Transport in Perovskite Solar Cells.</a></h2><p>The ability to effectively transfer photoexcited electrons and holes represents an important endeavor toward achieving high-efficiency solar energy conversion. Herein, we develop a simple yet robust acid-treatment strategy to judiciously create an amorphous TiO 2 buffer layer intimately situated on the anatase TiO 2 surface as electron transport layer (ETL) for efficient electron transport. The facile acid treatment is capable of weakening the bonding of zigzag octahedral chains in anatase TiO 2 , thereby shortening staggered octahedron chains to form an amorphous buffer layer on the anatase TiO 2 surface. Such amorphous TiO 2 -coated ETL possesses an increased electron density due to the presence of  vacancies, leading to efficient electron transfer from perovskite to TiO 2 . Compared to pristine TiO 2 -based devices, the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with acid-treated TiO 2 ETL exhibit enhanced short circuit current and power conversion efficiency. These findings demonstrate an unconventional route to crafting effective ETLs by deliberately creating an intimate, tailored amorphous semiconductor buffer layer for high-performance PSCs. This study may provide insights into the importance of rational design of efficient electron transporting layers in PSCs.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

He failed an initial trial of non-invasive ventilation and was planned for intubation and mechanical ventilation. However, the patient suffered a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest peri-intubation. He was started on our institution's protocolized post-cardiac arrest care bundle, which included cerebral regional  saturation (rSO) monitoring and TTM. Initial arterial blood gas (ABG) post-return of spontaneous circulation showed severe respiratory acidosis, and the patient was sedated, paralyzed, and ventilator settings optimized. Repeat ABG showed resolution of respiratory acidosis. However, a drop in rSO to 35% was subsequently noted. Ventilator settings were quickly adjusted, and dobutamine was started to improve global and cerebral perfusion. These measures improved cerebral rSO to more than 50%. Patient was cooled for 24 h and gradually rewarmed. He was later extubated with a cerebral performance category of 1 and is now on outpatient follow-up.During post-cardiac arrest care, there are many factors which can contribute to a decrease in cerebral blood flow. Therapeutic hypothermia and ventilation strategies, including the use of neuromuscular blocking agents, can both reduce pCO which is a major regulator of cerebrovascular tone. Accidental hypocapnia can lead to adverse cerebral vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion. Without cerebral oximetry, cerebral ischaemia may not be detected early and can potentially result in secondary brain injury.© The Author(s) 2019.

For any ion of interest in hadron therapy, the accuracy of dose delivery is limited by range uncertainties. This has led to efforts by several groups to develop in-vivo verification techniques, including Positron Emission Tomography (PET), for monitoring of the dose delivery. Beam-on PET monitoring during proton therapy through the detection of short-lived positron emitters such as 12N (T1/2 = 11 ms), an emerging PET technique, provides an attractive option given the achievable range accuracy, minimal susceptibility to biological washout and provision of near prompt feedback. Extension of this approach to helium ions requires information on the production yield of relevant short-lived positron emitters. This study presents the first measurements of the production of short-lived positron emitters in water, graphite, calcium and phosphorus targets irradiated with 59 MeV/u 3He and 50 MeV/u 4He beams. For these targets, the most produced short-lived nuclides are 13O/12N (T1/2 = 8.6/11 ms) on water, 13O/12N on graphite, 43Ti/41Sc/42Sc (T1/2 = 509 - 680 ms) on calcium, 28P (T1/2 = 268 ms) on phosphorus. A translation of the results from elemental targets to PMMA and representative tissues such as adipose tissue, muscle, compact and cortical bone, shows the dominance of 13O/12N in at least the first 20 s of an irradiation with 4He and somewhat longer with 3He. As the production of 13O/12N in a 3He irradiation is 3 to 4 times higher than in a 4He irradiation, from a statistical point of view, range verification using 13O/12N PET imaging will be about 2 times more precise for a 3He irradiation compared to a 4He irradiation.© 2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665666>CaWRKY27 negatively regulates salt and osmotic stress responses in pepper.</a></h2><p>WRKY transcription factors are key regulatory components of plant responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses. In pepper (Capsicum annuum), CaWRKY27 positively regulates resistance to the pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum and negatively regulates thermotolerance. Here, we report that CaWRKY27 functions in the response to salinity and osmotic stress. CaWRKY27 transcription was induced by salinity, osmotic, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments, as determined using qPCR and GUS assays. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants heterologously expressing CaWRKY27 had an increased sensitivity to salinity and osmotic stress, with a higher inhibition of both root elongation and whole plant growth, more severe chlorosis and wilting, lower germination rates, and an enhanced germination sensitivity to ABA than the corresponding wild-type plants. Furthermore, most marker genes associated with reactive  species (ROS) detoxification and polyamine and ABA biosynthesis, as well as stress-responsive genes NtDREB3, were downregulated in plants transgenically expressing CaWRKY27 upon exposure to salinity or osmotic stress. Consistently, silencing of CaWRKY27 using virus-induced gene silencing conferred tolerance to salinity and osmotic stress in pepper plants. These findings suggest that CaWRKY27 acts as a molecular link in the antagonistic crosstalk regulating the expression of defense-related genes in the responses to both abiotic and biotic stresses by acting either as a transcriptional activator or repressor in pepper.Copyright © 2019.

Oocytes matured by standard IVM for 24 h (no pre-IVM) were used as the control. The percentage of oocytes arrested at germinal vesicle (GV) stage in each treatment group was examined at 0 h of IVM, and the nuclear maturation rate was assessed by evaluating the percentages of oocytes that reached metaphase II (M II) stage at 24 h of IVM. After 24 h of IVM, oocytes were subjected to  fertilization (IVF) and   embryo culture (IVC). Cleavage rates were assessed 48 h post-insemination. Blastocyst production rates were recorded on day 8 after IVF. In addition, intra-oocyte glutathione (GSH) and reactive  species (ROS) content for each treatment were tested at 0 h and 24 h of IVM.No differences were observed between the CNP pre-IVM treatment and control groups in the rate of bovine oocytes maturing to the M II stage, cleavage and blastocysts production rates after IVF, and intra-oocyte GSH levels. Notably, the presence of cysteamine during pre-IVM culture with CNP significantly improved the rate of embryos developed to the blastocyst stage after  maturation and fertilization, moreover, it increased the levels of GSH and reduced the levels of ROS in bovine oocytes.The improvement to IVM bovine oocyte developmental competence through pre-IVM with CNP combined with cysteamine may be associated with an increased antioxidant defense.

However, due to the types of defects, most of the devices still suffer from poor environmental stability, defects inducing complexity, and uncontrollability. Here, we fabricate memory cells based on synthesized high-quality two-dimensional layered transition-metal oxide (α-MoO3) nanosheets which can be thinned to 8.68 nm (∼6 layers) and find a unipolar nonvolatile resistive switching behavior. Driven by the migration of intrinsic  vacancies, the devices show a large memory window (∼105), good memory voltage stability, long-term endurance (for durations of over 3 days and 50 manual DC switching cycles) and multi-bit memory states. Furthermore, we find the devices with an excellent temperature tolerance of lower SET/RESET voltages and a larger memory window (>104 at 380 K) at higher temperatures, suggesting their potential in practical applications.

ROS are also produced by NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidases in response to growth factors and cytokines by normal physiological signaling pathways. NADPH oxidase, a member of NOX family, utilizes molecular  (O2) to generate ROS such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2•-). Imbalance between ROS production and its elimination is known to be the major cause of various human diseases. NOX family proteins are exclusively involved in ROS production which makes them attractive target(s) for the treatment of ROS-mediated diseases including cancer. Molecules such as Keap1/Nrf2, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDRs), NF-κB, KRAS, kallistatin, gene associated with retinoic-interferon-induced mortality-19 and deregulated metabolic pathways are involved in ROS production in association with NADPH oxidase. Therapeutic strategies targeting NADPH oxidases in ROS driven cancers are not very effective due to its complex regulatory circuit. Tumor suppressor miRNAs viz. miR-34a, miR-137, miR-99a, and miR-21a-3p targeting NADPH oxidases are predominantly downregulated in ROS driven cancers. miRNAs also regulate other cellular machineries such as Keap1/Nrf2 pathway and NMDRs involved in ROS production and consequently drug resistance. Here we discuss the structure, function and metabolic role of NADPH oxidase, NOX family protein-protein interaction, their association with other pathways and NADPH oxidase alteration by miRNAs. Moreover, we also discuss and summarize studies on NADPH oxidase-associated with various malignancies and their therapeutic implications.

However, no reports have investigated the appearance of autophagy or the connection between autophagy and apoptosis in HeLa cells treated with 20()-GRg3. Cell viability was measured by CCK-8 (cell counting kit-8) assays. Apoptosis and the cell cycle were analyzed by Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry. Apoptotic pathways were examined by ROS (reactive  species) determination and rhodamine 123 assays. Western blot analysis was used to determine changes in protein levels. Autophagy induction was monitored by acidic vesicular organelle staining and EGFP-LC3 transfection. 20()-GRg3 inhibited autophagy of cells in a starved state, making it impossible for cells to maintain a steady state through autophagy, and then induced apoptosis. 20()-GRg3 blocked the late stage of autophagy (fusion of lysosomes and degradation of autophagic lysosomes), including a decrease in acidic vesicular organelle fluorescence, increased LC3 I-II conversion, accumulation of EGFP-LC3 fluorescence, GFP-mRFP-LC3 red-green fluorescence ratio, degradation of the substrate p62, and loss of the balance between autophagy and apoptosis, which induced apoptosis. ROS increased, the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased, apoptotic inducer AIF was released from mitochondria, and nuclear transfer occurred, triggering a series of subsequent apoptotic events. Autophagy inducer rapamycin inhibited the apoptosis induced by 20()-GRg3, whereas autophagy inhibitor BA1 promoted apoptosis induced by 20()-GRg3. Therefore, 20()-GRg3 promoted HeLa cell apoptosis by regulating autophagy.

The study aim was to demonstrate the efficacy of DP for patients with severe respiratory insufficiency after cardiothoracic surgeries.We retrospectively reviewed 10 patients who underwent DP for severe respiratory insufficiency due to postoperative diaphragmatic paralysis; eight of them required mechanical ventilation, and two needed high-flow  therapy prior to DP. The symptoms, lung function, and elevation of the diaphragm were assessed before and after DP.All patients were successfully withdrawn from mechanical ventilation after DP and discharged without the need for  therapy. The mean perioperative Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnea scale (ATS/ERS 2004) score improved in 30 days (from 4 to 1.8) and in 90 days (from 4 to 0.6) after DP. Lung dynamic compliance was also ameliorated (mean improvement: 41.9 to 60.7 mL/cmH2O). Radiography revealed improved elevation of the diaphragm (mean improvement of 1.8 intercostal spaces, range, 1-2). Mean hospital stay after DP was 65.5 days (range, 25-187 days).

Failure of myocardial recovery has life-altering consequences: transition to durable mechanical circulatory support (dMCS), urgent heart transplantation, or withdrawal of support. Clinical factors controlling myocardial recovery under these circumstances remain largely unknown.Using a retrospective cohort, we developed a model for early prediction of transition to dMCS in patients undergoing pVA-ECMO for cCS. To promote myocardial recovery, our clinical management centered around left-ventricular pressure unloading, i.e. targeting pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (PCWP) ≤18mmHg. We collected demographic data, laboratory findings, inotrope use, and 2D-transthoracic echocardiography measurements, all limited to the first 72h of pVA-ECMO (D1-3).Out of 70 patients who were alive after pVA-ECMO, 27 patients underwent implantation of dMCS. There was no significant difference in survival to hospital discharge between patients with or without transition to dMCS. Ejection fraction [per 10% increase, OR 0.37 (0.17-0.79)] and amount of inotropic support [OR 4.77 (1.6-14.18)] but neither myocardial wall tension nor PCWP emerged as significant predictors of transition to dMCS. Optimism-corrected c-index [0.90 (0.89-0.90)] revealed excellent discriminative ability of our model.Our model for early prediction of transition to dMCS in patients with cCS undergoing pVA-ECMO identifies indicators of inotropic state as relevant factors.

Our idea was that CF, acting on HIF1α, in combination with current anticancer therapies could improve their effectiveness.To evaluate the effect of CF in association with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, different human cancer cell lines and mice with mesothelioma were analysed by tumour growth, clonogenic assay, western blot and immunohistochemical analysis.CF in combination with radiation with or without cisplatin increases the death rate of cancer cells. , 70% of mice treated with CF before the mesothelioma graft did not show any tumour growth, indicating a possible preventive effect of CF. Moreover, in mouse mesothelioma xenografts, CF improves the effect of radiotherapy also in combination with chemotherapy treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumour explants showed that HIF1α expression was reduced by the combination of CF and radiotherapy treatment and even more by the combination of CF and radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment. Mechanistically, CF increases the fraction of oxygenated cells, making the radiotherapy more effective with a greater production of reactive  species (ROS) that in turn, reduce the HIF1α expression. This effect is amplified by further increase in ROS from chemotherapy.Collectively, results from preclinical trials suggest that CF could be a useful intervention to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy or combined treatment strategies and could be a promising treatment modality to counteract cancer.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665600>Molecular  binding in the mitochondrial electron transfer flavoprotein.</a></h2><p>Reactive  species such as superoxide are potentially harmful byproducts of the aerobic metabolism in the inner mitochondrial membrane, and complexes I (the ETF enzyme) and III (the cytochrome bc1 complex) of the electron transport chain have been identified as primary sources.

However, little is known about how blood vessels develop stereographically in the neocortex and how they control the expansion and differentiation of neural progenitors during neocortical development. We show that highly vascularized and avascular regions are strictly controlled in a spatially and temporally restricted manner and are associated with distinct cell populations. Dividing basal progenitors and oligodendrocyte precursors preferentially contact honeycomb vessels, but dividing apical progenitors are localized in avascular regions without Flt1-positive endothelial cells but directly contact with sprouting neovascular tip cells. Therefore, not all blood vessels are associated equally with neural progenitors. Furthermore, a disruption of normal vascular patterning can induce abnormalities in neural development, whereas the impaired features of neural progenitors influenced angiogenesis patterning. These results indicate that close association between the nervous and vascular systems is essential for neocortex assembly.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, there are still lots of issues that need to be addressed towards the practical application. Here, free-standing Co-doped NiO three-dimensional nanosheets were prepared by a hydrothermal synthesis method and directly employed as air-breathing cathode of Li-O2 battery. The morphological phenomenon and electrochemical performance of the as-prepared cathode material were characterized by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge tests, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The Co-doped NiO electrode delivered a maximum discharge capacity of around 12857 mAh g-1 with a low overpotential (0.82 V) at 200 mA g-1. Under upper-limit specific capacities of 500 mAh g-1 at 400 mA g-1, the Li-O2 batteries exhibited a long cycle-life of 165 cycles. Compared with the undoped NiO electrode, the Li-O2 battery based on the Co-doped NiO cathode showed significantly higher  reduction reaction (ORR) and  evolution reaction (OER) activities. This superior electrochemical performance is because the partial substitution of Ni2+ in the NiO matrix by Co2+ to improve the p-type electronic conductivity of NiO. In addition, the morphology and specific surface area of NiO are affected by Co doping, which can expand electrode-electrolyte contact area and lead to sufficient space for Li2O2 deposition.

Despite the development of numerous new targeted therapies, MTX remains the backbone of RA therapy due to its potent efficacy and tolerability. There has been also a growing interest in the use of MTX in the treatment of chronic viral mediated arthritis. Many viruses-including old world alphaviruses, Parvovirus B19, hepatitis B/C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus-have been associated with arthritogenic diseases and reminiscent of RA. MTX may provide benefits although with the potential risk of attenuating patients' immune surveillance capacities. In this review, we describe the emerging mechanisms of action of MTX as an anti-inflammatory drug and complementing its well-established immunomodulatory activity.

Recently, it has been discovered that ultra-high dose rates of ionizing radiation may preferentially spare normal tissue over tumor tissue. This effect, referred to as FLASH radiotherapy, has been observed in various animal models as well as, more recently, in a human patient. This effect may be related to the cell sparing found  at ultra-high dose rates of photons and electrons dating back to the 1960s. Conditions representative of physiologic  were found to be essential for this process to occur. However, there is no conclusive data on whether this effect occurs with protons, as all results to date have been in cells irradiated at ambient  conditions. There have been no ultra-high dose-rate experiments with heavy ions, which would be relevant to the implementation of FLASH to carbon-ion therapy. These basic science results are critical in guiding this rapidly advancing field, since clinical particle therapy machines capable of FLASH dose rates have already been promoted for protons. To help ensure FLASH radiotherapy is reliable and maximally effective, the radiobiology must keep ahead of the clinical implementation to help guide it. In this context,  and  proton and heavy ion experiments involving FLASH dose rates need to be performed to evaluate not only short-term consequences, but also sequelae related to long-term health risks. Critical to these future studies is consideration of relevant  tensions at the time of irradiation, as well as appropriate  modeling to assist in understanding the initial physicochemical events.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665615>Enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities in developing anther contributes to heat stress alleviation and sustains grain yield in wheat.</a></h2><p>Climatic variations along with a rise in temperature during the winter season impose severe heat stress during the anthesis stage of spring wheat, resulting in severe yield losses. The present study was conducted to evaluate the influence of heat stress on redox homeostasis in developing anthers and flag leaves of wheat. Five Indian bread wheat genotypes were studied under field conditions during the dry season, with two extreme sowing dates (timely and very late sown) to explore the effect of heat stress on anthesis stage. Results showed that elevated temperature during anthesis caused significant increase in reactive  species (ROS) content and malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation in developing anthers, triggering pollen mortality. Moreover, defective source (leaf) to the sink (anthers) mobilisation of starch also contributes in reducing pollen viability. However, ROS-induced oxidative damage of developing anthers under heat stress varied among the wheat genotypes depending upon differential antioxidant enzyme activities. Wheat genotype with enhanced antioxidant activities and reduced ROS built up in developing anthers sustained their grain yield, suggesting thermo-tolerance in wheat to be associated with antioxidant enzyme-mediated improved ROS-scavenging mechanism not only in leaves even in developing anther also. In the present study, heat stressed wheat genotype WH 730 exhibited effective source to sink mobilisation and sustainable grain yield with improved ROS scavenging, conferring greater potential for heat tolerance. We conclude that redox homeostasis and balanced source sink activity played a significant role for sustainable yield and heat tolerance in wheat.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661473>[How Methods of Molecular Biology Shape Our Understanding of the Hematopoietic System].</a></h2><p>Blood is extremely important for a multicellular organism: it connects all organs and tissues, supplies them with nutrients and , removes carbon dioxide and metabolic products, maintains homeostasis, and provides protection against infections. That is why studies on blood have always drawn a great deal of attention. In ancient times, it was believed that the soul was in the blood and that it sometimes "sank into the stomach." Initially, the study of blood was limited to morphological methods, to which physiological and cellular research were added in the twentieth century. With their help, researchers established that mature blood cells are formed from a rare population of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are located in the bone marrow. The development of molecular biology methods and their combination with classical physiological ones allowed a breakthrough in understanding the structure of the hematopoietic system, which changed our understanding not only of hematopoiesis but also about the nature of adult stem cells. This review describes the molecular assays used in experimental hematology, and how their application has gradually been expanding our knowledge of blood formation and continues to provide new information about it.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658386>Evidence for a Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer Mechanism in a Biomimetic System for Monoamine Oxidase B Catalysis.</a></h2><p>Mechanistic studies with 5-ethyl-3-methyllumiflavinium (Fl+) perchlorate, a biomimetic model for flavoenzyme monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) catalysis, and the tertiary, allyl amine 1-methyl-4-(1-methyl-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MMTP) reveal that proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) may be an important pathway for MAO catalysis. The first step involves single electron transfer (SET) leading to the free radicals Fl•and MMTP•, the latter produced by deprotonation of the initially formed and highly acidic MMTP•+. Molecular  (O2) is found to play a hitherto unrecognized role in the early steps of the oxidation. MMTP and several structurally similar tertiary amines are the only tertiary amines oxidized by MAO, and their structural/electronic properties provide the key to understanding this behavior. A general hypothesis about the role of SET in MAO catalysis, and the recognition that PCET occurs with appropriately substituted substrates is presented.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These pathological conditions make mitochondria of a particular interest in the regulation of cell function and death by both apoptosis and autophagy. Therefore, this work was undertaken to investigate mitochondria function, autophagy and apoptosis protein markers in the kidney from rat model of intra-abdominal obesity and renal damage induced by high sucrose diet. Mitochondria from sucrose fed (SF) kidney in the presence of pyruvate/malate generated hydrogen peroxide (HO) at a higher rate than from control (79.81 ± 4.98 vs 65.84 ± 1.95 pmol/min/mg protein). With succinate, the release of HO was significantly higher compared with pyruvate/malate and it remained higher in SF than in control mitochondria (146.4 ± 8.8 vs 106.1 ± 5.9 pmol/min/mg protein). However, cytochrome c release from SF kidney mitochondria was lower than from control. In addition, cardiolipin, a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid was found increased in SF mitochondria due to the enhanced amount of both cardiolipin synthase and tafazzin. Cardiolipin was also found enriched with saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids which are less susceptible to peroxidative stress involved in cytochrome c release. Furthermore, Beclin-1, LC3-B, as autophagy protein markers, and caspase 9 as apoptosis protein marker, were found decreased in SF kidney. These results suggest that the decline of autophagy protein markers and the lack of apoptosis process could be a pathological mechanism of cell dysfunction leading to the progression of renal disease in SF rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664858>E-Cigarette Use Increases Susceptibility to Bacterial Infection by Impairment of Human Neutrophil Chemotaxis, Phagocytosis and NET Formation.</a></h2><p>E-cigarettes are portrayed as safer relative to conventional tobacco. However, burgeoning evidence suggests that E-cigarettes may adversely affect host defenses. However, the precise mechanisms by which E-cigarette vapor alters innate immune cell function have not been fully elucidated. We determined the effects of E-cigarette exposure on the function and responses to infectious challenge of the most abundant innate immune cell, the neutrophil, using isolated human neutrophils and a mouse model of Gram-negative infection. Our results revealed that human neutrophils exposed to E-cigarette vapor had 4.2-fold reductions in chemotaxis towards the bacterial cell-well component f-Met-Leu-Phe (p < 0.001). F-actin polarization and membrane fluidity were also adversely affected by E-cigarette vapor exposure. E-cigarette exposed human neutrophils exhibited a 48% reduction in production of reactive  species (ROS; p < 0.001). Given the central role of ROS in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) production, NET production was quantified and E-cigarette vapor exposure was found to reduce NETosis by 3.5-fold (p < 0.01); formulations with and without nicotine containing propylene glycol exhibiting significant suppressive effects. However, non-canonical NETosis was unaffected. In addition, exposure to E-cigarette vapor lowered the rate of bacterial bioparticle phagocytosis by 47% (p < 0.05). In our physiologic mouse model of chronic E-cigarette exposure and sepsis, E-cigarette vapor inhalation led to reduced neutrophil migration into infected spaces and a higher burden of Pseudomonas. These findings provide evidence that E-cigarette use adversely impacts the innate immune system and may place E-cigarette users at higher risk for dysregulated inflammatory responses and invasive bacterial infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659918>NADPH oxidase: a therapeutic target for hyperoxaluria-induced oxidative stress - an update.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661288>Photolyase-like catalytic behavior of CeO2.</a></h2><p>Nanomaterials with intrinsic enzyme-like characteristics exhibit their great potentials as alternatives of natural enzymes. Among various enzymes, the finding of substitutes of DNA photolyases, a family of photoenzymes for repairing the ultraviolet (UV) induced DNA damage by forming cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) between two adjacent thymines in a DNA strand, is still unsuccessful. CPDs raise significant health concerns in various skin diseases. Essentially, DNA photolyases selectively split dimers into monomers by photoelectrons under visible light irradiation is a photocatalytic process. However, majority of semiconductors are unprosperous due to the accompanied photogenerated reactive  species (ROS), which decompose CPDs into fragments and thereby lead to a nonselective photocatalysis. Fortunately, CeO2 as semiconductor might deliver the selectively photocatalytic repair of UV-induced DNA damages, where the photoelectrons are used for the CPD cleavage and the photogenerated ROS are locally suppressed for its anti-oxidant nature. Herein, we reported the defective porous CeO2 delivered the photolyase-like activity by enhancing visible light absorption, enabling the effective interaction between CPDs and catalysts, and subsequently triggering the selective photocleavage of CPDs into monomers. Further in vitro cellular and in vivo animal evaluations illustrated its high potentials as alternatives of DNA photolyases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663528>Design and synthesis of a vanadate-based ratiometric fluorescent probe for sequential recognition of Cu ions and biothiols.</a></h2><p>A novel YVO4:Eu3+@CDs core-shell nanomaterial with two main emission peaks at 405 and 617 nm was synthesized through a simple mixing method, in which the carbon quantum dots (CDs) self-assembled with the YVO4:Eu3+ nanoparticle, due to the high affinity of -containing groups such as -COOH or -OH of CDs to the metal ions on the surface of YVO4:Eu3+. The red fluorescence of YVO4:Eu3+@CDs located at 617 nm can be quenched by Cu2+ ions efficiently, while the blue emission remains invariable; based on this, we construct a ratio fluorescent probe YVO4:Eu3+@CDs for Cu2+ ion detection, in which the blue emission of CDs is selected as the reference signal, and the red emission of YVO4:Eu3+ acts as an output signal. Furthermore, the addition of biothiol recovers the quenched red fluorescence quickly, which can be completed in 18 minutes. Thus, YVO4:Eu3+@CDs can also be used as a 'turn on' ratio fluorescent probe for biothiol rapid detection. Taking l-cysteine (l-Cys) as the model, the fluorescence intensity of the 617 nm peak increases with increasing Cys, and the ratio of F617/F405 is linear to the concentration of Cys in the range of 0.1 μM to 10 μM with a detection limit of 41 nM. Compared with these single wavelength emission biothiol fluorescent probes, an obvious change in the fluorescence color from blue to pink can be conveniently observed by the naked eye under a UV lamp. Meanwhile, this ratiometric probe has also been demonstrated to be used for the visual identification of biothiols in real blood serum samples.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655924>Recombinant human Cyclophilin A stimulates hair follicle cells via Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>To explore potential effects of recombinant peptidyl-prolyl isomerase human Cyclophilin A (CypA) in the growth of mouse hair and human hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HDP).The hair growth of 8-weeks C57BL/6 mouse was significantly stimulated by recombinant human CypA protein.

In particular, a strong intermolecular force, negative charge assisted hydrogen bonding ((-)CAHB), was recently identified, which explains the unusually strong adsorption of negatively charged compounds on carbon nanotubes with -containing functional groups. However, most previous studies only probed molecules with one benzene ring. The adsorption of ionizable compounds with more than one benzene ring and additional functional groups has not been examined. This study investigated the effect of surface functionalization, molecular size and structure of six aromatic carboxylic acids on their adsorption on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) in batch reactors. In addition, the short-range interactions of the neutral acids with MWNTs were calculated to evaluate the effect of aromaticity and bulkiness. Hydrophobicity and electrostatic interactions dominate the intermolecular forces between ionized contaminants and MWNT surfaces. pH dependent octanol/water partitioning coefficient (Dow) is a more precise indicator of the adsorption of ionizable compounds on MWNTs. (-)CAHB is a significant force only for compounds with one benzene ring.

How myeloid cells acquire the protumoral properties during tumorigenesis is poorly understood. We report here that the polarity protein TIPE2 (tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like 2) mediates the functional polarization of murine and human MDSCs by specifying their pro- and antitumoral properties. Tumor cells induced the expression of TIPE2 in Gr1CD11b cells through reactive  species (ROS). TIPE2 in turn increased the expression of protumoral mediators such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β while inhibiting the expression of antitumoral mediators. Consequently, tumor growth in TIPE2-deficient mice was significantly diminished, and TIPE2-deficient MDSCs markedly inhibited tumor growth upon adoptive transfer. Pharmaceutical blockade of ROS inhibited TIPE2 expression in MDSCs and reduced tumor growth in mice. These findings indicate that TIPE2 plays a key role in the functional polarization of MDSCs and represents a new therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.© 2019 Yan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664285>Polyethyleneimine coated FeO magnetic nanoparticles induce autophagy, NF-κB and TGF-β signaling pathway activation in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells via reactive  species generation.</a></h2><p>Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), as one of the most intensively researched NPs, have a range of applications in cancer treatments. In current research, we have focused on the influences of MNPs on cancer cells. We chose polyethyleneimine (PEI) coated MNPs (PEI-MNPs) as a model and they are colloidally stable in biological media. It can be proved that PEI-MNPs result in autophagy induction via mTOR-Akt-p70S6 K and ATG7 signaling pathways. For the first time, we have reported that PEI-MNPs activate both NF-κB and TGF-β signaling, two key pro-inflammatory pathways, in cancer cells. More significantly, we have found that autophagy induction and NF-κB and TGF-β activation can be efficiently suppressed through the inhibition of PEI-MNP dependent reactive  species (ROS) over-production. ROS are deemed as a 'double edge sword' for cancer cells, owing to the cancer-suppressing and cancer-promoting actions.

Each lens was worn unilaterally for 25 minutes, whereas the other eye served as a control. Before and after lens wear, the endothelium was photographed using specular microscopy. The number of blebs and measurements of the areas of cells and blebs were analyzed. Paired t tests compared differences in the areas of cells and blebs. Differences in median bleb number were evaluated using the Wilcoxon test.After wearing the SL200 and SL400 lenses, respectively, 9 and 14 subjects had at least one bleb. The median bleb number after wearing lenses was significantly different (SL200, 0.00; SL400, 1.00; P = .02). Bleb and cell areas were significantly different (blebs, 293 ± 28; cells, 370 ± 32 μm; P < .0001).After 25 minutes of wearing scleral lenses with each of the two targeted clearances, SL400 induced significantly more blebs than did SL200, suggesting evidence of reduced  and/or increased carbon dioxide levels under scleral lenses fitted with excessive clearance.

Caffeine is reported to have a function of protecting the liver and anti-tumor activity. Therefore, caffeine may be an ideal enhancer for HCC chemotherapy regimens. Our study showed that the combination of caffeine and 5-FU significantly inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells in vivo and in vitro comparing with caffeine or 5-FU monotherapy. The CI values of caffeine (0.5 mM) combined with 5-FU (25, 50 μM) were all less than 1, confirming that the utilization of drug combination has a synergistic inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HCC cells. Meanwhile, results of Western blot and TUNEL assays demonstrated that the apoptotic level of HCC cells in the combined group was significantly increased. The protein expression level of cleaved PARP was up-regulated, while the protein level of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was down-regulated. In addition, we found that ROS levels were increased in the 1 mM caffeine and 25 μM 5-FU combination group comparing with the control or single drug group. Taken together, this is the first study to demonstrate that the combination of caffeine and 5-FU inhibits HCC cells proliferation and promotes cellular apoptosis by regulating intracellular ROS production.

However, the problems including the inefficient transport of metal catalysts and insufficient endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content in cells still need to be improved. In this study, functional nanosystem encapsulated with benzothiazole complexes (FeTB2) and the photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) was designed for highly effective antitumor therapy. The surface of the nanocarriers was modified with dihydroartemisinin (DHA)-grafted polyglutamic acid. The induced hyperthermia enables the lipid-polymer shell to depolymerize, releasing FeTB2. The released FeTB2 could kill tumor cells in two different ways by inhibiting DNA replication and catalyzing H2O2 to produce active •OH. Moreover, the conjugated DHA could increase the amount of peroxides in tumor cells and significantly enhance ROS yield.

Oxidative stress played a key role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Our aim of this study was to investigate whether high glucose could provoke microvesicles generation from podocytes and its potential mechanism. Mouse podocyte clone 5 (MPC-5) were stimulated by high glucose. The intracellular reactive  species (ROS) of podocytes were measured by fluorescence microscopy with the probe of CM-H2DCFDA and MitoSOXTM. Antioxidants N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and alpha lipoic acid (α-LA) were used to treat podocytes after high glucose stimulation. The rate of podocyte apoptosis was evaluated with Annexin V-FITC by flow cytometry. NOX4 expression was examined and siRNA were performed to explore the mechanism of MVs generation. The quantities of MVs from MPC-5 cells was significantly increased (P&lt;0.05) by 4.6 times after 30 mM glucose stimulation, accompanied with double increased apoptosis. Cellular ROS generation was increased by high glucose at the peak of 48h stimulation. High glucose induced MVs was significantly decreased by 52.9% after pretreatment by antioxidant NAC. Nevertheless, Mitochondrial ROS in podocytes reached a peak at 4h stimulation, but specific antioxidant α-LA had no effect on the production of MVs (P&gt;0.05). Levels of NOX4 mRNA and protein expression were significantly upregulated by high glucose (P&lt;0.05). Podocyte-derived MVs by high glucose were eliminated by NOX4 siRNA. High glucose can provoke MVs generation from glomerular podocytes through ROS/NOX4 pathway, not from mitochondrial pathway.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663313>Mechanical power during an incremental test can be estimated from 2000-m rowing ergometer performance.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to identify the relationship between the mean power output of 2000-m rowing ergometer performance with the peak power output obtained during an incremental test, in addition to verifying the possibility of using the 2000-m mean power as an intensity associated with V̇O2max.Nineteen rowers (age 25.5 ± 10.6 years; V̇O2PEAK: 65.4 ± 5.8 mL.kg.min-1) completed an incremental test followed by a 2000-m familiarization test (day 1) and a 2000- m rowing ergometer test (day 2). During the incremental test, the peak power output (PV̇O2PEAK) and the exercise intensity thresholds were determined. The maximal  uptake (V̇O2PEAK) was analyzed in both tests.The PV̇O2PEAK (284.8 ± 44.7 W) presented the highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.978) with 2000-m mean power (284.2 ± 49.9 W) and was the only one included in stepwise regression explaining 96% of 2000-m mean power.

Male C57BL/6J mice practiced treadmill running with intermittent obstacles on a treadmill for 8 days.  uptake (VO) during treadmill running was measured as exercise efficiency. After obstacle exercise training, the VO measured during treadmill running with obstacles decreased significantly. Obstacle exercise-induced c-Fos expressions and dopamine turnover (DOPAC/dopamine) in the septum after obstacle exercise training were significantly higher than that before training. The dopamine turnover was correlated with exercise efficiency on the 3rd day after exercise training. Furthermore, the training effect on exercise efficiency was significantly decreased by injection of dopamine receptor antagonists into the septum and was associated with decreased c-Fos expressions in the septum and hippocampus of the mice.

BOD-Se-I showed higher 1O2 generation yield thanks to the enhanced heavy atom effect and this derivative was further tested detailly in cell culture studies under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. BOD-Se-I not only effectively functioned under hypoxic conditions but also showed highly selective photocytotoxicity towards cancer cells. The selectivity is believed to arise from difference in mitochondrial membrane potentials of healthy and cancerous cells. To best of our knowledge this marks the first example of a MT targeted BODIPY PS that functions under hypoxic conditions. Remarkably, thanks to the design strategy all these properties where realized by a compound that was synthesized in only five steps with 32% overall yield.

Surface chemistry, more specifically the surface silanol content, has been identified as an important toxicity modulator for SiO2 NPs. Here, quantitative relationships between the silanol content on SiO NPs, free radical generation and toxicity have been identified, with the purpose of synthesizing safer-by-design fumed silica nanoparticles.Consistent and statistically significant trends were seen between the total silanol content, cell membrane damage, and cell viability, but not with intracellular reactive  species (ROS), in the macrophages RAW264.7. SiO NPs with lower total silanol content exhibited larger adverse cellular effects. The SAEC epithelial cell line did not show any sign of toxicity by any of the nanoparticles. Free radical generation and surface reactivity of these nanoparticles were also influenced by the temperature of combustion and total silanol content.Surface silanol content plays an important role in cellular toxicity and surface reactivity, although it might not be the sole factor influencing fumed silica NP toxicity. It was demonstrated that synthesis conditions for SiO NPs influence the type and quantity of free radicals, oxidative stress, nanoparticle interaction with the biological milieu they come in contact with, and determine the specific mechanisms of toxicity. We demonstrate here that it is possible to produce much less toxic fumed silicas by modulating the synthesis conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658395>Effects of organic removal techniques prior to carbonate stable isotope analysis of lacustrine marls: a case study from palaeo-lake Fucino (central Italy).</a></h2><p>The suitability of organic matter (OM) removal pre-treatments in isotopic studies of lacustrine carbonates is currently under debate. Naturally occurring OM seems to have a negligible effect on the bulk isotopic composition of carbonates compared with changes induced by pre-treatments. This study provides further insights into the possible effects induced by commonly used pre-treatments on natural lacustrine carbonates.Sixteen samples from the Fucino F1-F3 lacustrine succession (Abruzzo, central Italy) were characterised for their mineralogical and geochemical composition and split in three identical aliquots. One aliquot was left untreated while the remaining two were treated with NaOCl and H O dilutions. The same treatment was applied to an internal standard consisting of pure Carrara marble. The treated and untreated samples were analysed for their carbon (δ C values) and  (δ O values) isotope compositions using an Analytical Precision AP2003 isotope ratio mass spectrometer.The samples had variable proportions of endogenic and detrital components, the detrital portion being more (less) abundant during colder (warmer) climate phases. We observed that neither the NaOCl nor the H O treatment were able to completely remove OM and therefore there was selective removal of compounds within the OM pool. A possible effect of pre-treatment is the loss of carbonates intimately interspersed within the OM, as suggested by the evolution of isotopic ratios towards the local detrital array.Our study highlights sample-specific changes in geochemistry associated with sample pre-treatments; however, such changes do not seem to lead to either systematic and/or predictable isotopic shifts. We suggest that the suitability of NaOCl or H O pre-treatments for OM removal should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

The main purpose of this study was to identify the macroinvertebrate families as a biological indicator and, consequently, determining the water ecological quality in the Ghezel Ozan River, NW Iran. The sampling was conducted at 18 stations in autumn 2017. At the same time, dissolved , temperature, turbidity, electrical conductivity, fecal and total coliform, BOD COD, phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, chloride, and sulfate were measured based on APHA in each station. Then, based on the collected data, the NSFWQI, IRWQIsc, EQR, and BMWP/ASPT indices were calculated. In total, 1778 individual belong to 12 orders and 22 families were identified, which the most abundant order was Ephemeroptera by 47.8%. Except for the pH, COD, DO, and nitrogen compounds, other studied parameters were exceeded from their acceptable level. It seems that the geological characteristics are very effective in changing the parameters especially salinity. The best water quality was at Kharmaneh-Sar station (7), which runs from the protected area at high altitudes without human pressure. Also, the trend of water quality decreases from the upstream to downstream, which is completely in line with human activities. Therefore, the results of this study can well illustrate the role of land use and geology changes on the macroinvertebrate communities, which can be used to evaluate the ecological integrity of the river. Regular monitoring of river water quality and controlling and managing the quantity and quality of fish farms along the river can help in the ecological health of the river.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658544>[Preliminary study on effect of intraoperative goal-directed fluid management on pulmonary function and  dynamics in patients with severe burns].</a></h2><p> To preliminarily investigate the effect of intraoperative goal-directed fluid management (GDFM) on pulmonary function and  dynamics in patients with severe burns.  From February 2017 to May 2018, 30 patients admitted to Burn Department of our hospital with severe burns who met the criteria for inclusion and needed escharectomy and skin grafting were enrolled in this prospective randomized controlled trial. The patients were divided into group GDFM of 15 cases [14 males and 1 female, (45±14) years old] and conventional liquid management group of 15 cases [12 males and 3 females, (42±10) years old] according to the random number table. During escharectomy and skin grafting, volume of patients in group GDFM was managed according to the GDFM scheme, based on cardiac output index, stroke volume variation, stroke volume index, hemoglobin, central venous  saturation (ScvO(2)), and other parameters; volume of patients in conventional liquid management group was managed according to clinical experience and conventional liquid management scheme, based on mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, urine output, hemoglobin, and other parameters. At post operation hour (POH) 1, 6, 12, and 24, arterial and venous blood was collected from patients of the two groups to determine the levels of extravascular lung water index (ELWI), global end-diastolic volume index (GEDI), oxygenation index, ScvO(2), central venous-to-arterial blood carbon dioxide partial pressure difference (Pcv-aCO(2)), lactic acid, pH value, bicarbonate ion, and base excess routinely. Data were processed with Fisher's exact probability test,  test, analysis of variance for repeated measurement, and least significant difference test.  (1) The ELWI of patients in group GDFM was (4.3±1.1) mL/kg at POH 1, which was significantly lower than (6.5±3.6) mL/kg in conventional liquid management group (=2.26, <0.05). The ELWI levels of patients in group GDFM at POH 6, 12, and 24 were (6.8±2.2), (6.6±2.0), and (6.9±1.6) mL/kg, respectively, significantly higher than the level at POH 1 within the same group (<0.01), and similar to (8.5±3.1), (7.8±2.3), and (8.0±3.5) mL/kg in conventional liquid management group (=1.73, 1.53, 1.10, >0.05). The GEDI levels between patients of the two groups were similar, and there was no significantly statistical difference between the two groups as a whole (treatment factor main effect =2.35, time factor main effect =0.44, interaction =0.07, >0.05). (2) The oxygenation index of patients in group GDFM was (350±78) mL/kg at POH 1, which was significantly higher than (259±109) mL/kg in conventional liquid management group (=2.63, <0.05). In conventional liquid management group, the oxygenation index of patients at POH 6 was significantly higher than that at POH 1, 12, or 24 (<0.01). The ScvO(2) levels of patients in group GDFM at POH 1, 6, and 12 were 0.516±0.105, 0.679±0.121, and 0.713±0.104, respectively, which were significantly higher than 0.382±0.194, 0.545±0.194, and 0.595±0.191 in conventional liquid management group (=2.35, 2.27, 2.10, <0.05). The ScvO(2) levels of patients in the two groups at POH 6, 12, and 24 were significantly higher than those levels at POH 1 within the same group (<0.01), and the ScvO(2) of patients in conventional liquid management group at POH 24 was significantly higher than that at POH 6 or 12 within the same group (<0.05 or <0.01). The Pcv-aCO(2) levels of patients in group GDFM were significantly lower than those in conventional liquid management group at POH 1 and 6 (=2.55, 2.71, <0.05). The Pcv-aCO(2) of patients in group GDFM at POH 12 was significantly lower than that at POH 6 or 24 within the same group (<0.05). (3) The blood lactic acid levels and pH values between patients of the two groups were similar at POH 1, 6, 12, and 24 (=0.89, 0.19, 0.26, 0.23; 1.55, 0.71, 0.77, 0.77, >0.05). In conventional liquid management group, the blood lactic acid levels of patients at POH 6, 12, and 24 were significantly lower than the level at POH 1 within the same group (<0.05), and the pH values of patients at POH 6, 12, and 24 were significantly higher than the value at POH 1 within the same group (<0.05). The levels of bicarbonate ion and base excess between patients of the two groups were similar, and there were no significantly statistical differences between the two groups as a whole (treatment factor main effect =0.06, 0.11, time factor main effect =2.07, 1.59, interaction =1.45, 0.91, >0.05).  GDFM is helpful to improve the pulmonary function and  dynamics in patients with severe burns in the short term after escharectomy and skin grafting. It has certain significance in preventing and reducing pulmonary edema and pulmonary complications in patients with severe burn after operation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661104>Infrared photodissociation spectroscopy of di-manganese oxide cluster cations.</a></h2><p>Infrared multiple-photon dissociation (IR-MPD) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been employed to elucidate the geometric structure of a series of di-manganese oxide clusters Mn2Ox+ (x = 4-7). The theoretical exploration predicts that all investigated clusters contain a rhombus-like Mn2O2 core with up to four, terminally bound,  atoms. The short Mn-O bond length of the terminal  atoms of ≤1.58 Å indicates triple bond character instead of oxyl radical formation. However, the IR-MPD spectra reveal that higher energy isomers with up to two O2 molecules η2-coordinated to the cluster core can be kinetically trapped under the given experimental conditions. In these complexes, all O2 units are activated to superoxide species. In addition, the sequential increase of the  content in the cluster allows for a controlled increase of the positive charge localized on the Mn atoms reaching a maximum for Mn2O7+.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656964>Nanotubols under HO exposure: is it possible to poly-hydroxylate carbon nanotubes?</a></h2><p>We present a combined experimental and theoretical study dedicated to analyze the variations in the surface chemistry of hydroxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), so called nanotubols, when exposed to H2O2 at high temperatures. The formation, surface density, and distribution of -containing functional groups are studied by infrared (IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed on model functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs). After H2O2 exposure, the initial composition of -OH, -C[double bond, length as m-dash]O, and -COOH substituents notably changes, with carbonyl -C[double bond, length as m-dash]O groups being the ones that show the most notable increase on the carbon surface. Our highly oxidized MWCNTs are partially soluble and form complex two-dimensional patterns at the air-water interface, as evidenced by Brewster angle microscopy. In a second step, these films can be transferred to solid substrates to form porous multilayered carbon nanostructures with complex morphologies. In particular, and for the first time, we report the synthesis of "stadium-like" configurations made of MWCNT units whose formation and stability are a direct consequence of the self-assembly process occurring at the air/water interface. DFT calculations suggest the formation of molecular islands of -containing functional groups on the CNT surface. In addition, nudged elastic band studies reveal that, for these adsorbed phases, the reaction between two neighboring OH groups to produce atomic  and a physisorbed water molecule is characterized by energy barriers of ∼0.2 eV. These small values could be at the origin of the sizable increase in chemisorbed single- species determined by XPS data after H2O2 treatment at 60 °C. The simulation of the C 1s binding energies (BE) allows us to more clearly identify the different -containing functionalities as well as to reveal how the local atomic environment affects their characteristic BEs. Even if we were unable to polyhydroxylate our carbon nanotubes, we believe that H2O2-treated MWCNTs are interesting materials for more complex post-functionalization procedures that might lead to the fabrication of novel carbon nanostructures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662419>Ascorbate deficiency does not limit non-photochemical quenching in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.</a></h2><p>Ascorbate (Asc, vitamin C) plays essential roles in development, signaling, hormone biosynthesis, regulation of gene expression, stress resistance and photoprotection. In vascular plants, violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE) requires Asc as reductant, thereby it is required for the energy-dependent component of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). To assess the role of Asc in NPQ in green algae, which are known to contain low amounts of Asc, we searched for an insertional Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant affected in the VTC2 gene encoding GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase, which catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of Asc.. The Crvtc2-1 knockout mutant was viable and, depending on the growth conditions, contained 10 to 20% Asc relative to its wild type. When C. reinhardtii was grown photomixotrophically at moderate light, the zeaxanthin-dependent component of NPQ emerged upon strong red illumination both in the Crvtc2-1 mutant and in its wild type. Deepoxidation was unaffected by Asc deficiency, demonstrating the Chlorophycean VDE found in C. reinhardtii does not require Asc as a reductant. The rapidly induced, energy-dependent NPQ component characteristic of photoautotrophic C. reinhardtiicultures grown at high light was not limited by Asc deficiency either. On the other hand, a reactive  species-induced photoinhibitory NPQ component was greatly enhanced upon Asc deficiency, both under photomixotrophic and photoautotrophic conditions. These results demonstrate Asc has distinct roles in NPQ formation in C. reinhardtiithan in vascular plants.{copyright, serif} 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

To determine whether a single dose of Zynamite administered 1 h before exercise increases repeated-sprint performance, 20 men and 20 women who were physically active were randomly assigned to three treatments following a double-blind cross-over counterbalanced design. Treatment A, 140 mg of Zynamite, 140 mg of quercetin, 147.7 mg of maltodextrin, and 420 mg of sunflower lecithin; Treatment B, 140 mg of Zynamite, 140 mg of quercetin, and 2126 mg of maltodextrin and Treatment C, 2548 mg of maltodextrin (placebo). Subjects performed three Wingate tests interspaced by 4 min and a final 15 s sprint after ischemia. Treatments A and B improved peak power output during the first three Wingates by 2.8% and 3.8%, respectively (treatment x sprint interaction,  = 0.01). Vastus Lateralis oxygenation (NIRS) was reduced, indicating higher O extraction (treatment × sprint interaction,  = 0.01). Improved O extraction was observed in the sprints after ischemia ( = 0.008; placebo vs. mean of treatments A and B). Blood lactate concentration was 5.9% lower after the ingestion of Zynamite® with quercetin in men (treatment by sex interaction,  = 0.049). There was a higher Vastus Lateralis O extraction during 60 s ischemia with polyphenols (treatment effect,  = 0.03), due to the greater muscle VO in men ( = 0.001). In conclusion, a single dose of Zynamite combined with quercetin one hour before exercise improves repeated-sprint performance and muscle O extraction and mitochondrial O consumption during ischemia. No advantage was obtained from the addition of phospholipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660541>Xeno-Transplantation of macro-encapsulated islets and Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Pancreatic Progenitors without Immunosuppression.</a></h2><p>Islet transplantation effectively treats diabetes but relies on immune suppression and is practically limited by the number of cadaveric islets available. An alternative cellular source is insulin-producing cells derived from pluripotent cell sources. Three animal cohorts were used in the current study to evaluate whether an -providing macro-encapsulation device, 'βAIR', could function in conjunction with human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and their derivatives. The first cohort received macro-encapsulated undifferentiated hESCs, a second cohort received hESCs differentiated to a pancreatic progenitor state with limited endocrine differentiation. A reference cohort received human islets. Macro-encapsulation devices were implanted subcutaneously and monitored for up to 4 months. Undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells did not form teratoma but underwent cell death following implantation. Human C-peptide (hC- peptide) was detectable in host serum one week after implantation for both other cohorts. hC-peptide levels decreasing over time but remained detectable up to the end of the study. Key factors associated with mature endocrine cells were observed in grafts recovered from cohorts containing islets and hESC-derivatives including C-peptide, insulin, glucagon and urocortin 3. We conclude that the 'βAIR' macroencapsulation device is compatible with both human islets and pluripotent derivatives, but has a limited capability of sustaining undifferentiated pluripotent cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659840>The effects of different positions on saturation and vital signs in patients.</a></h2><p>Patient positioning is an independent nursing intervention and may increase peripheral oxygenation for patients with lung disease. Few studies have been conducted on the effect of body positions on oxygenation in patients with lung disease.To investigate the effects of five different positions on peripheral  saturation (SpO ) and vital signs in patients with lung disease.A semi-experimental study was conducted.Consecutive samples were recorded from critical care patients followed in the chest clinic of a university hospital. A total of 109 patients with lung disease were recruited. Patients who were able to lie in all positions, and who had unilateral or bilateral lung disease documented by a medical diagnosis by a physician were included in this study. The SpO and vital signs were measured at each position three times.For patients with right, left, and bilateral lung disease, lying on the right side of the body at 45 in bed, the SpO was higher, but this difference was not statistically significant. There was a significant difference at 40 minutes between the pulse rate in patients with left and bilateral lung disease, but not in patients with right lung disease. No significant differences were found between respiratory rates and body temperature in patients in any of the three groups at 10, 25, and 40 minutes.Although this difference was not statistically significant, lying on the right side of the body at 45 in bed can be an effective position for improving oxygenation in all patients with lung disease.As there is insufficient evidence to suggest a specific position, further studies are needed. This study provides evidence that the best oxygenation in patients with unilateral and bilateral lung disease can be obtained by determining the appropriate position for critical care nurses.© 2019 British Association of Critical Care Nurses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664492>Microaerobic conditions caused the overwhelming dominance of Acinetobacter spp. and the marginalization of Rhodococcus spp. in diesel fuel/crude oil mixture-amended enrichment cultures.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to reveal how different microbial communities evolve in diesel fuel/crude oil-contaminated environments under aerobic and microaerobic conditions. To investigate this question, aerobic and microaerobic bacterial enrichments amended with a diesel fuel/crude oil mixture were established and analysed. The representative aerobic enrichment community was dominated by Gammaproteobacteria (64.5%) with high an abundance of Betaproteobacteriales (36.5%), followed by Alphaproteobacteria (8.7%), Actinobacteria (5.6%), and Candidatus Saccharibacteria (4.5%). The most abundant alkane monooxygenase (alkB) genotypes in this enrichment could be linked to members of the genus Rhodococcus and to a novel Gammaproteobacterium, for which we generated a high-quality draft genome using genome-resolved metagenomics of the enrichment culture. Contrarily, in the microaerobic enrichment, Gammaproteobacteria (99%) overwhelmingly dominated the microbial community with a high abundance of the genera Acinetobacter (66.3%), Pseudomonas (11%) and Acidovorax (11%). Under microaerobic conditions, the vast majority of alkB gene sequences could be linked to Pseudomonas veronii. Consequently, results shed light on the fact that the excellent aliphatic hydrocarbon degrading Rhodococcus species favour clear aerobic conditions, while -limited conditions can facilitate the high abundance of Acinetobacter species in aliphatic hydrocarbon-contaminated subsurface environments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657933>Iron-Exchanged Zeolite Micromotors for Enhanced Degradation of Organic Pollutants.</a></h2><p>Self-propelled iron-exchanged zeolite (Fe-zeolite) micromotors have been developed for efficient degradation of organic pollutants via Fenton-like reaction. The incorporation of iron ions into the zeolite framework, which was achieved by solid state ion exchange, imparts catalytic properties to the microporous structures. The coreagent for Fenton oxidation, hydrogen peroxide, also works as the fuel to propel the motion of the Fe-zeolite micromotors. Asymmetrically deposited platinum layer on the Fe-zeolites catalyzes the fuel decomposition, generating  bubbles to propel the autonomous motion of the heterogeneous catalysts. The self-propelled motion together with the bubble formation leads to effective fluid mixing and consequent improvement in the degradation efficiency, making up the low diffusivity of heterogenous catalysts. The advantage of micromotor-based degradation strategy was verified by Fenton oxidation of phenol performed with a small percentage of Fe-zeolite micromotors. Able to be collected and reused, the Fe-zeolite micromotors avoid secondary contamination and wastage. Combing the advantages of both homogenous and heterogenous catalysts, the self-propelled Fe-zeolite micromotors provide a highly efficient and environmentally friendly strategy for degradation of organic contaminants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660812>Thiosemicarbazones as a Potent Anticancer Agents and Their Modes of Action.</a></h2><p>Thiosemicarbazones (TSCs) are a class of Schiff bases usually obtained by the condensation of thiosemicarbazide with a suitable aldehyde or ketone. TSCs have been focus of chemists and biologists due to their wide range of pharmacological effects. One of the promising areas in which these excellent metal chelators are being developed is their use against cancer. TSCs have a wide clinical antitumor spectrum with efficacy in various tumor types such as leukemia, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer and bladder cancer. To obtain better activity different series of TSCs have been developed by modifying the heteroaromatic system in their molecules. These compounds possessed significant antineoplastic activity when the carbonyl attachment of the side chain was located at a position α to the ring nitrogen atom, whereas attachment of the side chain β or γ to the heterocyclic N atom resulted in inactive antitumor agents. In addition, replacement of the heterocyclic ring N with C also resulted in a biologically inactive compound suggesting that a conjugated N,N,S-tridentate donor set is essential for the biological activities of thiosemicarbazones. Several possible mechanisms have been implemented for the anticancer activity of thiosemicarbazones.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662181>Effect of Treatment of Central Sleep Apnea/Cheyne-Stokes Respiration on Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction in Heart Failure: A Network Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>Patients who have experienced heart failure with central sleep apnea/Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSA/CSR) have an impaired prognosis. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and adaptive servoventilation (ASV) as well as nocturnal  (O₂) are proposed treatment modalities of CSA/CSR. The goal of the study is to assess whether and how different treatments of CSA/CSR affect cardiac function.Databases were searched up to December 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effect of any combination of CPAP, ASV, O₂ or an inactive control on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with heart failure and CSA/CSR. A systematic review and network meta-analysis using multivariate random-effects meta-regression were performed.Twenty-four RCTs (1,289 patients) were included in the systematic review and data of 16 RCTs (951 patients; apnea-hypopnea-index 38 ± 3/h, LVEF 29 ± 3%) could be pooled in a network meta-analysis. Compared to an inactive control, both CPAP and ASV significantly improved LVEF by 4.4% (95% confidence interval 0.3-8.5%, P = 0.036) and 3.8% (95% confidence interval 0.6-7.0%, P = 0.025), respectively, whereas O₂ had no effect on LVEF (P = 0.35). There was no difference in treatment effects on LVEF between CPAP and ASV (P = 0.76). The treatment effect of positive pressure ventilation was larger when baseline LVEF was lower in systolic heart failure.CPAP and ASV are effective in improving LVEF in patients with heart failure and CSA/CSR to a clinically relevant amount, whereas nocturnal O₂ is not. There is no difference between CPAP and ASV in the comparative beneficial effect on cardiac function.© 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661891>Molecular Links between Central Obesity and Breast Cancer.</a></h2><p> Worldwide, breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy in women, in regard to incidence and mortality. In recent years, the negative role of obesity during BC development and progression has been made abundantly clear in several studies. However, the distribution of body fat may be more important to analyze than the overall body weight. In our review of literature, we reported some key findings regarding the role of obesity in BC development, but focused more on central adiposity. Firstly, the adipose microenvironment in obese people bears many similarities with the tumor microenvironment, in respect to associated cellular composition, chronic low-grade inflammation, and high ratio of reactive  species to antioxidants. Secondly, the adipose tissue functions as an endocrine organ, which in obese people produces a high level of tumor-promoting hormones, such as leptin and estrogen, and a low level of the tumor suppressor hormone, adiponectin. As follows, in BC this leads to the activation of oncogenic signaling pathways: NFκB, JAK, STAT3, AKT. Moreover, overall obesity, but especially central obesity, promotes a systemic and local low grade chronic inflammation that further stimulates the increase of tumor-promoting oxidative stress. Lastly, there is a constant exchange of information between BC cells and adipocytes, mediated especially by extracellular vesicles, and which changes the transcription profile of both cell types to an oncogenic one with the help of regulatory non-coding RNAs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663077>Effects of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation on pulmonary arterial hypertension: A prospective, randomized study.</a></h2><p>This study aims to investigate the effects of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation (CPR) on cardiopulmonary function, quality of life, depression, and hemodynamic parameters in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and to compare the efficacy of hospital- and home-based exercise programs.Between December 2014 to May 2016, a total of 30 patients with PAH were included in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to either a hospital-based (n=15) or home-based exercise program (n=15). The hospital group was assigned to a cardiac rehabilitation (three days/week, 1 hour/week 50 to 70% maximal  uptake [PvO]) program for eight weeks. The home-based exercise group received home exercises alone. Before and after eight weeks of rehabilitation, all patients were evaluated for their functional status (PvO), pulmonary function including forced expiratory volume in one sec (FEV1), mL, forced vital capacity (FVC), mL and FEV1/FVC%, quality of life using Short Form-36 (SF-36), depression severity using Beck Depression Inventory, and hemodynamic parameters including left ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure.Of the patients, 12 completed the study in each group. There was no statistically significant difference in the functional status, quality of life, depression severity, and hemodynamic parameters after the rehabilitation compared baseline between the groups.Based on our study results, short-term CPR seems not to be beneficial in patients with PAH.

The prevalence rate of spontaneous pneumothorax in Korea has increased since 2002. The male to female ratio was approximately 4-10:1, with a higher prevalence rate in men. By age, the 15-34 years old group, and particularly those aged 15-19 years old, showed the highest prevalence rate; the rate then declined before increasing again for those aged 65 years or older. In total, 47%-57% of patients with spontaneous pneumothorax underwent hospitalisation. The average number of rehospitalisations due to pneumothorax was 1.56 per person, and more than 70% of recurrences occurred within 1 year. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was the most common comorbidity. The average treatment period was 11 days as an outpatient and 14 days in-hospital. The average medical costs were $94.50 for outpatients and $2523 for hospital admissions. The most common treatment for spontaneous pneumothorax was  inhalation and thoracostomy, and the most commonly prescribed medications were analgesics, antitussives and antibiotics.We here detailed the epidemiology and treatments for spontaneous pneumothorax in Korea.

A key challenge is the unambiguous identification of spectroscopic fingerprints which can be used to track their function. Herein, we employ five complementary techniques to modulate the electronic occupancy of states associated with  vacancies  in BiVO photoanodes, allowing us to identify a spectral signature for the ionisation of these states. We obtain an activation energy of ̴ 0.2 eV for this ionisation process, with thermally activated electron de-trapping from these states determining the kinetics of electron extraction, consistent with improved photoelectrochemical performance at higher temperatures. Bulk, un-ionised states however, function as deep hole traps, with such trapped holes being energetically unable to drive water oxidation. These observations help address recent controversies in the literature over  vacancy function, providing new insights into their impact upon photoelectrochemical performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657932>Strong Hole Trapping Due to  Dimers in BiVO: Effect on the Water Oxidation Reaction.</a></h2><p>We present a study of hole bipolarons in BiVO.
