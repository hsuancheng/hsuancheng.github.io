Due to the presence of TDZ, these calli were under permanent chemical treatment and the differentiation of adventitious shoots from protocorm-like-bodies (PLBs) was blocked. When embryogenic calli were transferred onto a medium without TDZ, shoot organogenesis and plantlet regeneration occurred. To gain better knowledge about the biochemical and molecular processes involved in the morphoregulatory role of TDZ, hormonal and metabolomic analyses were performed. Our results indicate that in the presence of TDZ, embryogenic calli contained a high amount of abscisic acid (ABA) essentially metabolized into abscisic acid glucosyl ester (ABAGE) and phaseic acid (PA), which was the most abundant. When transferred onto a medium without TDZ, shoot regeneration and development take place in four stages that include: embryogenic calli growth, differentiation of PLBs from meristmatic cells zones (MCZ), shoot organogenesis from PLBs and the elongation of well-formed shoots. From a hormonal perspective, the significant reduction in ABA metabolism and its readjustment in the ABAGE pathway triggered PLBs formation. However, this first morphogenesis was stimulated by a strong reduction in IAA metabolism. The organogenesis of PLBs into shoots is associated with an increase in ABA catabolism and a gradual shift in cellular metabolism towards shoot differentiation. Thus, the initiation of the elongation process in shoots is correlated with an alteration in metabolite composition, including an increase in  reserves (sucrose/starch) and a rapid decrease in alanine content. Our data highlighted the relationship between endogenous hormone signalling, carbohydrate metabolism and shoot organogenesis in Orchid plants.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Frigatebirds often perform that kind of flight, at daytime as well as in the night. This suggests that they are capable of flying inside clouds in a controlled and stabilized manner. The control requirements for ascents in terms of a circling flight in updrafts of trade cumulus clouds are analyzed, and the necessary aerodynamic control moments are determined. Based on a stability investigation, it is shown that there are restoring effects which act against disturbances causing possible deviations from the circling flight condition. The aerodynamic moments which effectuate that stabilization are identified. Furthermore, the problem of neutral azimuth stability which generally exists in the flight of birds and which is the reason for continually increasing deviations from the course is dealt with. It is shown for the circling flight mode of frigatebirds inside clouds that, here, deviations are small and remain constant, suggesting that a corrective control action is not required. This is particularly important for circling flight in conditions without a visual reference, like inside clouds.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p></html>
