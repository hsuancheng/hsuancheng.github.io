As reported by clinical observations, variation in hormonal levels might alter disease susceptibility and progression. Specifically, decreased levels of testosterone in males are reported to be permissive for disease onset. Accordingly, testosterone seems to exert protective effects in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this context, it is important to highlight that testosterone is further metabolized into 17β-estradiol or dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In this study, we aimed to explore the protective effects of DHT treatment in EAE Dark Agouti rats (i.e. an experimental model showing a protracted relapsing EAE). Data obtained 45 days after EAE induction showed that DHT exerts a beneficial effect on clinical scores, coupled with decreased gliosis (i.e. glial fibrillary acidic protein and major histocompatibility complex of class II staining) and inflammation (i.e. translocator protein 18 kDa, interleukin-1β, Toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor-κB expression) in the spinal cord. Moreover, parameters linked to oxidative stress and tissue damage, like thiobarbituric -reactive substance levels and Bcl-2-associated X protein expression, and to mitochondrial activity (i.e. content of mitochondrial DNA and proteins), were improved after DHT administration. This neuroactive steroid may be further metabolized into 3α- or 3β-diol. However, assessment of the levels of these metabolites after DHT treatment seems to suggest that the protective effects observed here are due to DHT itself. Altogether, the present results indicate that DHT was effective in reducing the severity of chronic EAE and, consequently, may represent an interesting perspective for multiple sclerosis treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034873>Induction of a non-apoptotic mode of cell death associated with autophagic characteristics with steroidal maleic anhydrides and 7β-hydroxycholesterol on glioma cells.</a></h1><p>Steroidal maleic anhydrides were prepared in one step: lithocholic, chenodeoxicholic, deoxicholic, ursocholic, and hyodeoxicholic  derivatives. Their capability to induce cell death was studied on C6 rat glioma cells, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol was used as positive cytotoxic control. The highest cytotoxicity was observed with lithocholic and chenodeoxicholic  derivatives (23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α-hydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1a), and 23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α,7α-dihydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1b), respectively), which induce a non-apoptotic mode of cell death associated with mitochondrial membrane potential loss and reactive oxygen species overproduction. No cells with condensed and/or fragmented nuclei, no PARP degradation and no cleaved-caspase-3, which are apoptotic criteria, were observed. Similar effects were found with 7β-hydroxycholesterol. The cell clonogenic survival assay showed that compound 1b was more cytotoxic than compound 1a and 7β-hydroxycholesterol. Compound 1b and 7β-hydroxycholesterol also induce cell cycle modifications. In addition, compounds 1a and 1b, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol favour the formation of large acidic vacuoles revealed by staining with acridine orange and monodansylcadaverine evocating autophagic vacuoles; they also induce an increased ratio of [LC3-II / LC3-I], and modify the expression of mTOR, Beclin-1, Atg12, and Atg5-Atg12 which is are autophagic criteria. The ratio [LC3-II / LC3-I] is also strongly modified by bafilomycin acting on the autophagic flux. Rapamycin, an autophagic inducer, and 3-methyladenine, an autophagic inhibitor, reduce and increase 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death, respectively, supporting that 7β-hydroxycholesterol induces survival autophagy. Alpha-tocopherol also strongly attenuates 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death. However, rapamycin, 3-methyladenine, and α-tocopherol have no effect on compounds 1a and 1b-induced cell death. It is concluded that these compounds trigger a non apoptotic mode of cell death, involving the mitochondria and associated with several characteristics of autophagy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We here explored whether the levels of neuroactive steroids (i.e., neuroprotective agents) in the hippocampus may be altered by short-term diabetes (i.e., one month). To this aim, by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry we observed that in the experimental model of the rat raised diabetic by streptozotocin injection, one month of pathology induced changes in the levels of several neuroactive steroids, such as pregnenolone, progesterone and its metabolites (i.e., tetrahydroprogesterone and isopregnanolone) and testosterone and its metabolites (i.e., dihydrotestosterone and 3α-diol). Interestingly these brain changes were not fully reflected by the plasma level changes, suggesting that early phase of diabetes directly affects steroidogenesis and/or steroid  in the hippocampus. These concepts are also supported by the findings that crucial steps of steroidogenic machinery, such as the gene expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (i.e., molecule involved in the translocation of cholesterol into mitochondria) and cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (i.e., enzyme converting cholesterol into pregnenolone) and 5α-reductase (enzyme converting progesterone and testosterone into their metabolites) are also affected in the hippocampus. In addition, cholesterol homeostasis as well as the functionality of mitochondria, a key organelle in which the limiting step of neuroactive steroid synthesis takes place, are also affected. Data obtained indicate that short-term diabetes alters hippocampal steroidogenic machinery and that these changes are associated with impaired cholesterol homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippocampus, suggesting them as relevant factors for the development of diabetic encephalopathy.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

L3 was believed to be an inactive photoproduct of excessive UV radiation whose formation prevents excessive vitamin D production. Recently, we reported that L3 is present in serum and that CYP11A1 can act on L3 producing monohydroxy- and dihydroxy-metabolites which inhibit skin cell proliferation similarly to 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. In this study we tested the ability of human CYP27A1 to hydroxylate L3. L3 was metabolized by purified CYP27A1 to 3 major products identified as 25-hydroxyL3, (25R)-27-hydroxyL3 and (25S)-27-hydroxyL3, by NMR. These three products were also seen when mouse liver mitochondria containing CYP27A1 were incubated with L3. The requirement for CYP27A1 for their formation by mitochondria was confirmed by the inhibition of their synthesis by 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol, an intermediate in bile  synthesis which serves as an efficient competitive substrate for CYP27A1. CYP27A1 displayed a high k for the  of L3 (76 mol product/min/mol CYP27A1) and a catalytic efficiency (k/K) that was 260-fold higher than that for vitamin D3. The CYP27A1-derived hydroxy-derivatives inhibited the proliferation of cultured human melanoma cells and colony formation with IC values in the nM range. Thus, L3 is metabolized efficiently by CYP27A1 with hydroxylation at C25 or C27 producing metabolites potent in their ability to inhibit melanoma cell proliferation, supporting that L3 is a prohormone which can be activated by CYP-dependent hydroxylations.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
