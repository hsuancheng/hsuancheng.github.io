The disease is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and behavioral difficulties and motor function retardation.In this study, targeted exome sequencing was used in consanguineous parent (mother) of a deceased child with clinical diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis. Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm the candidate pathogenic variants in extended family members and segregation analysis. In silico pathogenicity assessment of detected variant using multiple computational predictive tools were performed. Computational docking using the Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD) 6.0.1 software applied to evaluate affinity binding of altered protein for its ligand, N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine. Moreover, with I-TASSER software functional alterations between wild and mutant proteins evaluated.We identiﬁed a novel heterozygote deletion variant (c.1294-1304 del CTCTTCCCCAA, p.432LeufsX25) in the  gene. The variant was classified as pathogenic based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guideline. Computational docking with the Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD) 6.0.1 software confirmed different affinity binding of truncated protein for its ligand. Moreover, I-TASSER software revealed structural and functional alterations of mutant proteins.This study expands the spectrum of  pathogenic variants and confirms the utility of targeted NGS sequencing in genetic diagnosis and also the utility and power of additional family information.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632355> Perspectives for Non-classical Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia With Relation to the Classical Form of the Disease.</a></h2><p>Non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NC-CAH) represents mild form of CAH with the prevalence of 0. 6 to 9% in women with androgen excess. Clinical and hormonal findings in females with NC-CAH are overlapping with other hyperandrogenic entities such as polycystic ovary  hence causing difficulties in diagnostic approach.  consequences in subjects with NC-CAH are relatively unknown. We are lacking longitudinal follow of these patients regarding natural course of the disease or the therapeutic effects of the different drug regiments. Patients with NC-CAH similarly to those with classical form are characterized with deteriorated cardiovascular risk factors that are probably translated into cardiometabolic diseases and events. An increased preponderance of obesity and insulin resistance in patients with NC-CAH begin at young age could result in increased rates of  sequelae and cardiovascular disease later during adulthood in both sexes. On the other hand, growth disorder was not proven in patients with NC-CAH in comparison to CAH patients of both gender characterized with reduced final adult height. Similarly, decreased bone mineral density and osteoporosis are not constant findings in patients with NC-CAH and could depend on the sex, and type or dose of corticosteroids applied. It could be concluded that NC-CAH represent a particular form of CAH that is characterized with specificities in clinical presentation, diagnosis, therapeutic approach and  outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Macut, Zdravković, Bjekić-Macut, Mastorakos and Pignatelli.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657254>[Musculoskeletal relevance of obesity: a new approach to an old topic].</a></h2><p>Authors discuss the musculoskeletal aspects of obesity by applying a novel approach.

The aim of this study to investigate clinical studies about diagnostic and therapeutic modalities of vipoma patients. In this retrospective study, all patients of vipoma were investigated. Clinical features, laboratory data at initial presentation, management and outcomes were collected.The paper has written based on searching PubMed and Google Scholar to identify potentially relevant articles or abstracts. Categorical variables as percentage and continuous variables were reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD).All the patients presented with watery diarrhea (30/30, 100%) and dehydration was reported in 33.3% of them. Prevalence of laboratory findings in these patients were assessed for hypokalaemia (25/30, 83.3%),  acidosis (9/30, 33.6%), hypochloremia and achlorhydria (2/30, 6.6%). Elevated VIP levels have been seen in 73.3% patients with mean values of 882.85 ± 1134.87 pg/ml. Prevalence of diagnostic methods included CT scan in 19 patients (19/30, 63.3%), ultrasonography (15/50, 50%), and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (8/30, 26.6%). Medical treatments included somatostatin and analogues in 18 patients (18/30, 60%). Surgery included less percentage of treatment in these patients.CT scan can be used as a reliable modality for diagnosis of vipoma and somatostatin analogues can be used as the most effective treatment in vipoma patients.

This mismatch results in an excess of fat storage in ectopic depots, notably in the liver and viscera (= hepato-visceral, or central fat). There is still no FDA-approved treatment for adolescent PCOS. The prime aim should be a preferential loss of central fat, through lifestyle measures. Failure to sustain these measures is frequent, and the standard approach is to add an estroprogestagen contraceptive, even for girls who do not need contraception. Treatment with SPIOMET, a low-dose combination of spironolactone (to antagonize androgen and mineralocorticoid effects, and to activate BAT thereby raising energy expenditure), pioglitazone (to raise circulating HMW adiponectin concentrations) and metformin, is an alternative approach that holds the potential to revert the PCOS phenotype.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642088>A nurse-led lifestyle intervention using mobile application versus booklet for adults with - Protocol for a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>To compare the effect of a lifestyle intervention programme using mobile application versus booklet for adults with  living in the community.A multi-site randomized controlled trial with three parallel arms, namely,  app group, booklet group and control group.The research study has been supported by the Health and Medical Research fund in Hong Kong in 2019.

To address this, Orygen Youth Health has introduced physical health services including exercise physiologists and dieticians. These services are typically coordinated by the case manager and doctor. It is not yet known whether a treating team member dedicated to physical health will improve engagement, adherence and outcomes with these services. Hence, the protocol is presented here for a trial to evaluate the effect of including a physical health nurse in the care of young people with first-episode psychosis.This will be a single-blind randomized controlled trial that includes 15- to 24-year-olds with first-episode psychosis who have just commenced (within 30 days) antipsychotic medication. The primary outcome will be the event of clinically significant weight gain (≥7% body weight). Participants will be assigned either a physical health nurse in their treating team (in addition to the case manager and doctor) for a 12-week period, or treatment as usual (case manager and doctor).

Accumulating damage of cellular components can trigger various diseases, including  and cancer. Over the past few years, the physiological significance of microRNAs (miRNA) in cancer has been a focus of comprehensive research. In view of the extensive level of miRNA interference in biological processes, the roles of miRNAs in oxidative stress and their relevance in physiological processes have recently become a subject of interest. In-depth research is underway to specifically address the direct or indirect relationships of oxidative stress-induced miRNAs in liver cancer and the potential involvement of the thyroid hormone in these processes. While studies on thyroid hormone in liver cancer are abundantly documented, no conclusive information on the potential relationships among thyroid hormone, specific miRNAs, and oxidative stress in liver cancer is available. In this review, we discuss the effects of thyroid hormone on oxidative stress-related miRNAs that potentially have a positive or negative impact on liver cancer.

Also, the response to clomiphene citrate was studied as presence or absence of ovulation.The prevalence of phenotypes A, B, C, and D were 67.7%, 11%, 17.7%, and 3.6%, respectively. Phenotype A had significantly higher weight, body mass index, clinical, and biochemical hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities, ovarian reserve parameters, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and more deranged lipid profile ( < 0.05). Clomiphene resistance was significantly more common in phenotype A ( < 0.05). No significant differences were noted in the waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure and blood sugar values (fasting, 1-hour postprandial, 2-hour postprandial). Also, the Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), LH-FSH ratio, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and vitamin D levels were not significantly different among various PCOS phenotypes.Full-blown PCOS (phenotype A) is at a higher risk of adverse  and cardiovascular outcomes as compared with the others, and phenotype D is the least severe phenotype. Thus, the phenotypic division of patients with PCOS-related infertility can help in prognosticating the patients about the severity of the disease and the fertility outcome.Copyright: © 2019 Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623067>Factors Related to the Number of Existing Teeth among Korean Adults Aged 55-79 Years.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to determine the association between the number of existing teeth (NET) and socioeconomic status (SES), oral health-related behaviours, and  in Korean adults aged 55-79 years.

SIRT1 is a  sensor of cellular energy and exerts essential functions on energy metabolism, oxidative stress response, apoptosis, or aging. Importantly, SIRT1 deacetylates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), the master regulator of energy metabolism involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid utilization. However, the exact role of SIRT1 in controlling cardiac energy metabolism is still incompletely understood and conflicting results have been obtained. We generated a cardio-specific inducible model of Sirt1 gene deletion in mice () to decipher the role of SIRT1 in control conditions and following cardiac stress induced by pressure overload. SIRT1 deficiency induced a progressive cardiac dysfunction, without overt alteration in mitochondrial content or properties. Sixteen weeks after  deletion an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a higher rate of oxidative damage were observed, suggesting disruption of the ROS production/detoxification balance. Following pressure overload, cardiac dysfunction and alteration in mitochondrial properties were exacerbated in  mice. Overall the results demonstrate that SIRT1 plays a cardioprotective role on cardiac energy metabolism and thereby on cardiac function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641351>RAGE is a Potential Cause of Onset and Progression of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Fatty liver is a rising global health concern, significantly increasing the burden of health care cost. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a correlation with  and its complications.We reviewed the literature regarding the mechanisms of developing NAFLD through AGE-RAGE signaling.NAFLD, , and production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) share many common risk factors and appear to be connected. AGE induces production of the receptor for AGE (RAGE). AGE-RAGE interaction contributes to fat accumulation in the liver leading to inflammation, fibrosis, insulin resistance, and other complications of the fatty liver disease. The immune system, especially macrophages, has an important defense mechanism against RAGE pathway activities.Soluble form of RAGE (sRAGE) has the capability to reduce inflammation by blocking the interaction of AGE with RAGE. However, sRAGE has some limitations, and the best method of usage is probably autotransplantation of transfected stem cells or monocytes, as a precursor of macrophages and Kupffer cells, with a virus that carries sRAGE to alleviate the harmful effects of AGE-RAGE signaling in the settings of fatty liver disease.Copyright © 2019 Kamyar Asadipooya et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634043>Association of Sarcopenia with  in Korean Population Using 2009-2010 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.</a></h2><p> Some studies have investigated the relationship between sarcopenia and , and they have focused mainly on older subjects.

Targeting modifiable risk factors such as dietary habits is therefore of great importance. Many of today's health challenges with overweight and obesity may have behavioral roots, and traditional methods such as regulations and campaigns are often insufficient to improve dietary choices. Nudging or choice architecture might be a viable tool to influence people's everyday choices and behaviors to better outcomes. This paper reviews the current state of the rapidly expanding number of experimental field studies that investigate the effects/associations of nudging on healthy food choices. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, where 142 citations were identified. Based on selection criteria, six randomized controlled trials and 15 non-randomized controlled trials were ultimately included. The results of this systematic review show that many of the studies included traffic-light labeling, which may be a promising strategy.

We now consider the pathophysiology of OA according to the patient's risk factors because we know that they involve different pathogenic mechanisms. Thus, four major clinical phenotypes are defined based on risk factors which are age, trauma, obesity/ , and family history. Osteoarthritis is therefore a much more complex disease than it has been thought for a long time.

Primiparity, age over 35 years and BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² were rather associated with LOP. In a multivariate analysis with EOP or LOP as outcome variables compared with controls (normotensive), maternal age and pre-pregnancy BMI were independent risk factors for both EOP and LOP (p < 0.001). However, analyzing by increment of 5 (years of age, kg/m² for BMI) rising maternal ages and incidence of preeclampsia were strictly parallel for EOP and LOP, while increment of BMI was only associated with LOP. Controlling for maternal ages and booking/pre-pregnancy BMI, diabetes was not an independent risk factor neither for EOP or LOP. factors, other than diabetes, associated with pre-pregnancy maternal corpulence are specifically associated with LOP. This may be a direction for future researches on the maternal preeclamptic .

Fasting improves cognition, stalls age-related cognitive decline, usually slows neurodegeneration, reduces brain damage and enhances functional recovery after stroke, and mitigates the pathological and clinical features of epilepsy and multiple sclerosis in animal models. Primarily due to a lack of research, the evidence supporting fasting as a treatment in human neurological disorders, including neurodegeneration, stroke, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis, is indirect or non-existent.

Neurons in the hypothalamus expressing neuropeptide Y and agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP neurons) are strongly implicated in linking  cues with fertility regulation.We aimed here to determine the impact of selectively activating NPY/AgRP neurons, critical regulators of metabolism, on the activity of luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse generation.We employed a suite of in vivo optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches with serial measurements of LH to determine the impact of selectively activating NPY/AgRP neurons on dynamic LH secretion. In addition, electrophysiological studies in ex vivo brain slices were employed to ascertain the functional impact of activating NPY/AgRP neurons on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons.Selective activation of NPY/AgRP neurons significantly decreased post-castration LH secretion. This was observed in males and females, as well as in prenatally androgenized females that recapitulate the persistently elevated LH pulse frequency characteristic of polycystic ovary  (PCOS). Reduced LH pulse frequency was also observed when optogenetic stimulation was restricted to NPY/AgRP fiber projections surrounding GnRH neuron cell bodies in the rostral preoptic area. However, electrophysiological studies in ex vivo brain slices indicated these effects were likely to be indirect.These data demonstrate the ability of NPY/AgRP neuronal signaling to modulate and, specifically, reduce GnRH/LH pulse generation. The findings suggest a mechanism by which increased activity of this hunger circuit, in response to negative energy balance, mediates impaired fertility in otherwise reproductively fit states, and highlight a potential mechanism to slow LH pulsatility in female infertility disorders, such as PCOS, that are associated with hyperactive LH secretion.© 2019 S.

Several diseases, including an aggressive form of leukaemia, have been designated as associated with HTLV-1, whereby having HTLV-1 is a necessary condition for diagnosis. Beyond these diseases, there is uncertainty about other health effects of HTLV-1. We aimed to synthesise evidence from epidemiological studies on associations between health outcomes and HTLV-1.For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Embase, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, and Global Health for publications from their inception to July, 2018. We included cohort, case-control, and controlled cross-sectional studies that compared mortality or morbidity between people with and without HTLV-1. We excluded studies of psychiatric conditions, of symptoms or clinical findings only, of people who had undergone blood transfusion or organ transplant, and of population groups defined by a behavioural characteristic putting them at increased risk of co-infection with another virus. We extracted the risk estimates (relative risks [RRs] or odds ratios [ORs]) that reflected the greatest degree of control for potential confounders. We did a random-effects meta-analysis for groups of effect estimates where case ascertainment methods, age groups, and confounders were similar, presenting pooled estimates with 95% CIs and prediction intervals.Of the 3318 identified studies, 39 met the inclusion criteria, examining 42 clinical conditions between them. The adjusted risk of death due to any cause was higher in people with HTLV-1 when compared with HTLV-1-negative counterparts (RR 1·57, 95% CI 1·37-1·80). From meta-analysis, HTLV-1 was associated with increased odds of seborrheic dermatitis (OR 3·95, 95% CI 1·99-7·81), Sjogren's  (3·25, 1·85-5·70), and, inversely, with lower relative risk of gastric cancer (RR 0·45, 0·28-0·71). There were a further 14 diseases with significant associations or substantially elevated risk with HTLV-1 from single studies (eczema [children]; bronchiectasis, bronchitis and bronchiolitis [analysed together]; asthma [males]; fibromyalgia; rheumatoid arthritis; arthritis; tuberculosis; kidney and bladder infections; dermatophytosis; community acquired pneumonia; strongyloides hyperinfection ; liver cancer; lymphoma other than adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma; and cervical cancer).There is a broad range of diseases studied in association with HTLV-1. However, the elevated risk for death among people with HTLV-1 is not explained by available studies of morbidity. Many of the diseases shown to be associated with HTLV-1 are not fatal, and those that are (eg, leukaemia) occur too rarely to account for the observed mortality effect. There are substantial research gaps in relation to HTLV-1 and cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and  disease. The burden of disease associated with the virus might be broader than generally recognised.Commonwealth Department of Health, Australia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although whole-body glucose clearance is normal, one-month-old lambs with IUGR at birth have higher rates of hindlimb glucose uptake, which may compensate for myocyte deficiencies in glucose oxidation. Impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in IUGR lambs is due to lower intra-islet insulin availability and not from glucose sensing. We investigated adrenergic receptor (ADR) β2 desensitization by administering oral ADRβ modifiers for the first month after birth to activate ADRβ2 and antagonize ADRβ1/3. In IUGR lambs ADRβ2 activation increased whole-body glucose utilization rates and insulin sensitivity but had no effect on isolated islet or myocyte deficiencies. IUGR establishes risk for developing diabetes. In IUGR lambs we identified disparities in key aspects of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation, providing new insights into potential mechanisms for this risk.Placental insufficiency causes intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and disturbances in glucose homeostasis with associated β-adrenergic receptor (ADRβ) desensitization. Our objectives were to measure insulin-sensitive glucose metabolism in neonatal lambs with IUGR and to determine whether daily treatment with ADRβ2 agonist and ADRβ1/β3 antagonists for one month normalizes their glucose metabolism. Growth, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), and glucose utilization rates (GUR) were measured in control lambs, IUGR lambs, and IUGR lambs treated with β2-agonist clenbuterol, β1-antagonist atenolol, and β3-antagonist SR59230A (IUGR-AR). In IUGR lambs, islet insulin content and GSIS were less than in controls; however, insulin sensitivity and whole-body GUR were not different from controls. Of importance, ADRβ2 stimulation with β1/β3 inhibition increases both insulin sensitivity and whole-body glucose utilization in IUGR lambs. In IUGR and IUGR-AR lambs, hindlimb GUR were greater but fractional glucose oxidation rates and ex vivo skeletal muscle glucose oxidation rates were lower than controls. Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) was lower in IUGR and IUGR-AR skeletal muscle than in controls but GLUT1 was greater in IUGR-AR. ADRβ2, insulin receptor, glycogen content, and citrate synthase activity were similar among groups. In IUGR and IUGR-AR lambs heart rates were greater, which was independent of cardiac ADRβ1 activation. We conclude that targeted ADRβ2 stimulation improved whole-body insulin sensitivity but minimally affected defects in GSIS and skeletal muscle glucose oxidation. We show that risk factors for developing diabetes are independent of postnatal catch-up growth in IUGR lambs as early as one-month of age and are inherent to the islets and myocytes.

We postulated that Chinese women with PCOS would have higher risk of incident diabetes and cardiometabolic abnormalities than those without PCOS during long-term follow-up.One hundred ninety-nine Chinese women with PCOS diagnosed by the Rotterdam criteria and with a mean age of 41.2 years (SD = 6.4) completed a follow-up evaluation after an average of 10.6 ± 1.3 years. Two hundred twenty-five women without PCOS (mean age: 54.1 ± 6.7 years) who underwent baseline and follow-up evaluation over the same period were used for comparison. Progression of glycaemic status of women both with and without PCOS was assessed by using 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) screening with the adoption of 2009 American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria. The frequency of impaired glucose regulation, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia of women with PCOS at follow-up has increased from 31.7% (95% CI 25.2%-38.1%) to 47.2% (95% CI 40.3%-54.2%), 16.1% (95% CI 11.0%-21.2%) to 34.7% (95% CI 28.1%-41.3%), and 52.3% (95% CI 45.3%-59.2%) to 64.3% (95% CI 57.7%-71.0%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in follow-up women with PCOS is 26.1% (95% CI 20.0%-32.2%), almost double that in the cohort of women without PCOS (p < 0.001). Age-standardised incidence of diabetes among women with PCOS was 22.12 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 10.86-33.37) compared with the local female population incidence rate of 8.76 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 8.72-8.80) and 10.09 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 4.92-15.26, p < 0.001) for women without PCOS in our study. Incidence rate for women with PCOS aged 30-39 years was 20.56 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 12.57-31.87), which is approximately 10-fold higher than that of the age-matched general female population in Hong Kong (1.88 per 1,000 person-years, [95% CI 1.85-1.92]). The incidence rate of type 2 DM (T2DM) of both normal-weight and overweight women with PCOS was around double that of corresponding control groups (normal weight: 8.96 [95% CI 3.92-17.72] versus 4.86 per 1,000 person-years [95% CI 2.13-9.62], p > 0.05; overweight/obese: 28.64 [95% CI 19.55-40.60] versus 14.1 per 1,000 person-years [95% CI 8.20-22.76], p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis identified that baseline waist-to-hip ratio (odds ratio [OR] = 1.71 [95% CI 1.08-2.69], p < 0.05) and elevated triglyceride (OR = 6.63 [95% CI 1.23-35.69], p < 0.05) are associated with the progression to T2DM in PCOS. Limitations of this study include moderate sample size with limited number of incident diabetes during follow-up period and potential selection bias.High risk of diabetes and increased cardiovascular disease risk factors among Chinese women with PCOS are highlighted in this long-term follow-up study. Diabetes onset was, on average, 10 years earlier among women with PCOS than in women without PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637401>Frailty and the  - Results of the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II).</a></h2><p>Frailty and the  (MetS) are frequently found in old subjects and have been associated with increased risk of functional decline and dependency. Moreover, central characteristics of the MetS like inflammation, obesity and insulin resistance have been associated with the frailty . However, the relationship between MetS and frailty has not yet been studied in detail. Aim of the current analysis within the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) was to explore associations between MetS and frailty taking important co-variables such as nutrition (total energy intake, dietary vitamin D intake), physical activity and vitamin D-status into account.Complete cross-sectional data of 1,486 old participants (50.2% women, 68.7 (65.8-71.3) years) of BASE-II were analyzed. MetS was defined following the joint interim statement of the International Diabetes Federation Task Force on Epidemiology and Prevention; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; American Heart Association; World Heart Federation; International Atherosclerosis Society; and International Association for the Study of Obesity in 2009. Frailty was defined according to the Fried criteria. Limitations in physical performance were assessed via questionnaire, muscle mass was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and grip strength using a Smedley dynamometer. Adjusted regression models were calculated to assess the association between MetS and Frailty.MetS was prevalent in 37.6% of the study population and 31.9% were frail or prefrail according to the here calculated frailty index. In adjusted models the odds of being frail/prefrail were increased about 50% with presence of the MetS (OR1.5; 95% CI 1.2,1.9; p= 0.002). Moreover the odds of being prefrail/frail were significantly increased with low HDL-C (OR: 1.5 (95%CI: 1.0-2.3); p = 0.037); and elevated waist circumference (OR: 1.65 (95%CI: 1.1-2.3); p = 0.008).The current analysis supports an association between MetS and frailty. There are various , immune and endocrine alterations in MetS that also play a role in mechanisms underlying the frailty . To what extent cytokine alterations, inflammatory processes, vitamin D supply and hormonal changes in age and in special  states as MetS influence the development of frailty should be subject of further research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641636>Nonfunctioning and Subclinical Cortisol Secreting Adrenal Incidentalomas and their Association with : A Systematic Review.</a></h2><p>A growing body of evidence suggests that nonfunctioning and subclinical cortisol secreting adrenal incidentalomas (AIs) are associated with several components of  resulting in increased cardiometabolic risk.

To identify common variants in SNAP25 associated with schizophrenia and evaluate their effects on AIWG and antipsychotic responses in Han Chinese individuals with schizophrenia, we conducted a two-stage case-control study of 3,243 patients and 6,154 healthy controls. 2128 inpatients in the replication stage have received conventional treatment with an antipsychotic monotherapy (Haloperidol, Olanzapine or Risperidone) for 10 weeks at least. Weight change, antipsychotic responses and  indices change were assessed during treatments. Three SNPs were significantly associated with schizophrenia in samples (rs6039769, P = 6.64 × 10; rs3787283, P = 0.004283; rs3746544, P = 2.51 × 10). Of these, rs6039769 is a novel schizophrenia-associated SNP and is uncorrelated with the other two variants, which have previously been associated with schizophrenia in European-ancestry samples. Rs6039769 was significantly associated with AIWG (P < 0.001), but not with antipsychotic responses or  indices. Another two SNPs were not associated with AIWG or antipsychotic responses or  indices. Overall, there were significant differences in antipsychotic responses and  indices among the three treatment groups. Our findings suggest that SNAP25 gene may contribute to the susceptibility of AIWG and even  disturbances. A prior identification of high-risk of patients with rs6039769 would contribute to a better precision of the pharmacological treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The P2Y inhibitor was initially used for its platelet anti-aggregatory action to block thrombosis of the recanalized coronary artery or deployed stent. It is now recognized that these agents also offer potent cardioprotection against a reperfusion injury that occurs in the first minutes of reperfusion if platelet aggregation is blocked at the time of reperfusion. But this is difficult to achieve with oral agents which are slowly absorbed and often require time-consuming  activation. Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction who usually have a large mass of myocardium at risk of infarction seldom have sufficient time for upstream-administered oral agents to achieve a therapeutic P2Y level of inhibition by the time of balloon inflation. However, optimal treatment could be assured by initiating an IV cangrelor infusion shortly prior to stenting followed by subsequent post-PCI transition to an oral agent, that is, ticagrelor, once success of the recanalization and absence of need for surgical intervention are confirmed. Not only should this sequence provide optimal protection against infarction, it should also negate bleeding if coronary artery bypass grafting should be required since stopping the cangrelor infusion at any time will quickly restore platelet reactivity. It is anticipated that cangrelor-induced myocardial salvage will help preserve myocardial function and significantly diminish postinfarction heart failure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647051>Self-reported sleep disturbances are associated with poorer cognitive performance in older adults with hypertension: a multi-parameter risk factor investigation.</a></h2><p>Given the evidence of multi-parameter risk factors in shaping cognitive outcomes in aging, including sleep, inflammation, cardiometabolism, and mood disorders, multidimensional investigations of their impact on cognition are warranted. We sought to determine the extent to which self-reported sleep disturbances,  (MetS) factors, cellular inflammation, depressive symptomatology, and diminished physical mobility were associated with cognitive impairment and poorer cognitive performance.This is a cross-sectional study.Participants with elevated, well-controlled blood pressure were recruited from the local community for a Tai Chi and healthy-aging intervention study.One hundred forty-five older adults (72.7 ± 7.9 years old; 66% female), 54 (37%) with evidence of cognitive impairment (CI) based on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score ≤24, underwent medical, psychological, and mood assessments.CI and cognitive domain performance were assessed using the MoCA. Univariate correlations were computed to determine relationships between risk factors and cognitive outcomes. Bootstrapped logistic regression was used to determine significant predictors of CI risk and linear regression to explore cognitive domains affected by risk factors.The CI group were slower on the mobility task, satisfied more MetS criteria, and reported poorer sleep than normocognitive individuals (all p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that sleep disturbances, but no other risk factors, predicted increased risk of evidence of CI (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.26-4.87, 99% CI: 1.08-7.48). Further examination of MoCA cognitive subdomains revealed that sleep disturbances predicted poorer executive function (β = -0.26, 95% CI: -0.51 to -0.06, 99% CI: -0.61 to -0.02), with lesser effects on visuospatial performance (β = -0.20, 95% CI: -0.35 to -0.02, 99% CI: -0.39 to 0.03), and memory (β = -0.29, 95% CI: -0.66 to -0.01, 99% CI: -0.76 to 0.08).Our results indicate that the deleterious impact of self-reported sleep disturbances on cognitive performance was prominent over other risk factors and illustrate the importance of clinician evaluation of sleep in patients with or at risk of diminished cognitive performance.

The underlying condition appears to be an increase in total body uric acid stores and is usually marked by hyperuricemia. Hyperuricemia is typically defined as serum uric acid levels greater than 7.0 mg/dL. Gout is more common in men than women and usually has its onset in 4th or 5th decade of life. Approximately 1% of adult Americans report having gout and 5% have some degree of hyperuricemia. Management of gout can be directed at treatment of acute attacks of gouty arthritis or to long term maintenance therapy directed at preventing attacks or decreasing the risk of uric acid nephropathy or nephrolithiasis. Treatment of acute attacks usually rests on use of nonsteroid antiinflammatory agents such as indomethacin, naproxen, sulindac or celecoxib. Colchicine (1961: Colbenemid and others) is used both during acute episodes and in chronic maintenance therapy. However, the major approach to long term prevention of gout and the complications of uric acid nephropathy is the use of uricosuric acids such as probenecid (1951: Benuryl) and benzbromarone (not available in the United States) and/or inhibitors of xanthine oxidase, such as the xanthine derivative allopurinol (1966: Aloprim) and the newer nonnucleoside xanthine oxidase inhibitors such as febuxostat (2009: Uloric, Adenuric). Newer approaches to gout include use of lesinurad (Zurampic: 2015), a drug that inhibits the reabsorption of uric acid in the distal tubules of the kidney, and use of recombinant enzymes that metabolize uric acid such as pegloticase (Kystexxa), which is used in combination with xanthine oxidase inhibitors ito treat severe gout, and rasburicase (Elitek: 2002) which is used to treat the hyperuricemia associated with tumor lysis  induced by cancer chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628327>Trisomy 21 activates the kynurenine pathway via increased dosage of interferon receptors.</a></h2><p>Trisomy 21 (T21) causes Down  (DS), affecting immune and neurological function by ill-defined mechanisms. Here we report a large metabolomics study of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, showing in independent cohorts that people with DS produce elevated levels of kynurenine and quinolinic acid, two tryptophan catabolites with potent immunosuppressive and neurotoxic properties, respectively. Immune cells of people with DS overexpress IDO1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the kynurenine pathway (KP) and a known interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene. Furthermore, the levels of IFN-inducible cytokines positively correlate with KP dysregulation. Using  tracing assays, we show that overexpression of IFN receptors encoded on chromosome 21 contribute to enhanced IFN stimulation, thereby causing IDO1 overexpression and kynurenine overproduction in cells with T21. Finally, a mouse model of DS carrying triplication of IFN receptors exhibits KP dysregulation.

This study was designed to elucidate the prevalence of MetS and its risk factors in young people in urban areas of Pakistan.  A cross-sectional study was conducted in four undergraduate institutions in Lahore, Pakistan. Five hundred and nine young people participated, and each provided their informed consent for the collection of data on their demographic, physical, and biochemical characteristics along with information on their dietary, sleep, and physical activity habits.  Most participants reported consuming greater-than-recommended amounts of protein and smaller-than-recommended amounts of vegetables and fruits. The International Diabetes Federation criteria for MetS were fulfilled by 6.1% of the students. Hypertension (67.7%) and hypo-HDL-emia (64.5%) were the most common risk factors. More than 50% of the respondents slept fewer hours per day than recommended, and 33% had a sedentary lifestyle. Men, participants with a family history of  illness and those with low physical activity levels had higher odds of a positive result on screening for MetS.

Even if individuals have the same number of residual natural teeth, there are large differences in the masticatory performance between edentulous sites restored with a fixed dental prosthesis, including dental implants, and those restored with a removable dental prosthesis. This study assessed whether the prevalence and control of diabetes differed based on the use of removable dental prostheses through an analysis of nationally representative data.Overall, 8,155 individuals (3,525 men and 4,630 women) aged ≥ 50 years were included in this study and were classified into the following 3 groups: group 1, did not use any removable dental prostheses (NF); group 2, used removable partial dentures (RPD); and group 3, used removable complete dentures on at least 1 jaw (CD). The characterization of diabetic patients and glycemic control were analyzed and compared among groups. To determine the relationship between diabetes and the use of dental prostheses, multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed ( < 0.05).The adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for diabetes in men participants in groups NF, RPD, and CD were 1 (reference), 1.165 (0.878-1.544), and 1.491 (1.034-2.151), respectively, after adjusting for confounding factors. Diabetes and glycemic control were significantly associated with the use of removable dental prostheses among men.The use of removable dental prostheses is a potential risk indicator for uncontrolled diabetes in Korean men adults, suggesting the need for a comprehensive approach to minimize the complications of diabetes mellitus.© 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641587>Molecular based newborn screening in Germany: Follow-up for cystinosis.</a></h2><p>Newborn screening (NBS) programs for treatable  disorders have been enormously successful, but molecular-based screening has not been broadly implemented so far.This prospective pilot study was performed within the German NBS framework. DNA, extracted from dried blood cards was collected as part of the regular NBS program. As cystinosis has a prevalence of only 1:100,000-1:200,000, a molecular genetic assay for detection of the SMN1 gene mutation with a higher prevalence was also included in the screening process, a genetic defect that leads to spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). First tier multiplex PCR was employed for both diseases. The cystinosis screening employed assays for the three most common  mutations covering 75% of German patients; in case of heterozygosity for one of these mutations, samples were screened by next generation sequencing (NGS) of the CTNS exons for 101  mutations. A detection rate of 98.5% is predicted using this approach.Between January 15, 2018 and May 31, 2019, 257,734 newborns were screened in Germany for cystinosis. One neonate was diagnosed with cystinosis, consistent with the known incidence of the disease. No false positive or false negatives were detected so far. Screening, communication of findings to parents, and confirmation of diagnosis were accomplished in a multi-disciplinary setting. This program was accomplished with the cooperation of hospitals, physicians, and parents. In the neonate diagnosed with cystinosis, oral cysteamine treatment began on day 18. After 16 months of treatment the child has no clinical signs of renal tubular Fanconi .This pilot study demonstrates the efficacy of a molecular-based neonatal screening program for cystinosis using an existing national screening framework.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636096>Fumarate  signature for the detection of Reed  in humans.</a></h2><p>Inherited pathogenic variants in genes encoding the  enzymes succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and fumarate hydratase (FH) predispose to tumour development through accumulation of oncometabolites (succinate and fumarate respectively) (1).

In this study, we analysed the bone quality of premenopausal women with type 1 diabetes mellitus by microindentation. No differences in bone quality were identified between patients and healthy controls, suggesting that intensive insulin therapy can preserve bone health.To compare the bone quality of women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and healthy controls, and to determine the relationship with bone mineral density (BMD).This was a cross-sectional study of 45 premenopausal women with T1DM and 21 healthy controls, matched according to age and BMI. Clinical parameters, BMD and bone tissue mechanical properties (assessed using the bone material strength index [BMSi]) were evaluated in each group using microindentation. In T1DM patients, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA), the number of hypoglycaemic events and the status of chronic complications were also analysed.No differences in BMSi or BMD between T1DM patients and healthy controls were identified. In the T1DM patients, the mean HbA was 7.52% ± 1.00% and the mean time elapsed since diagnosis was 22.6 ± 12.2 years. Eight patients (17.7%) met the criteria for  (MetS), and microvascular complications were present in 12 patients (26.7%).

It is unsettled, however, whether marginal glucose intolerance is implicated in the onset and progression of small fiber dysfunction. Herein, we explored the relationship between glycated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) and pain sensation in the Japanese population.  A population-based study of 894 individuals (352 men, 542 women; average age 53.8 ± 0.5 years) and 55 subjects with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) in the 2017 Iwaki project were enrolled in this study. Individuals with diabetes were excluded. Relationships between pain threshold for intraepidermal electrical stimulation (P-IES) and parameters associated with  were examined.  P-IES was elevated with increasing of age in women but not in men. Average P-IES (mA) was increased in IFG subjects ( = 55, 0.20 ± 0.03) compared with normoglycemic/non-IFG individuals ( = 894, 0.15 ± 0.11) ( < 0.01). It was comparable between IFG and a group of normal high HbA1c (5.9-6.4%). Univariate linear regression analyses showed no influence of sex, triglyceride, or cholesterol on the value of P-IES. In contrast, there were significant correlations between P-IES and serum HbA1c level (ß = 0.120,  < 0.001) Adjustments for the multiple clinical measurements confirmed positive correlation of P-IES with HbA1c (ß = 0.077,  = 0.046).

From April 2015 to October 2017, 15,492 consecutive patients with diabetes diagnosed within 1 year and aged ≥30 years were recruited from 46 tertiary care hospitals in 24 cities across China. Glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody was assayed centrally and clinical data were collected locally. Classic type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were defined using the criteria of American Diabetes Association, Immunology of Diabetes Society and World Health Organization. MetS was defined using Chinese Diabetes Society's criteria. Logistic regression analysis was used to obtain odds ratios (OR) of determinants of MetS.  The overall prevalence of MetS was 66.5%, with the highest prevalence in T2DM (68.1%), followed by those in LADA (44.3%) and T1DM (34.2%) ( < 0.05 for all comparisons). After adjustment for traditional risk factors, T2DM had a 2.8-fold [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.36-3.37] MetS risk compared with LADA, whereas T1DM had significantly lower OR than LADA (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50-0.92). After further adjustment for insulin resistance, the OR of T2DM vs. LADA was slightly reduced but the OR of T1DM vs. LADA was greatly attenuated to non-significance (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.70-1.33). In addition to types of diabetes, age, gender, geographical residence, education attainment, alcohol consumption and HOMA2-IR were independent determinants of MetS.  MetS was highly prevalent, not only in T2DM but also in T1DM and LADA in Chinese newly diagnosed patients; higher risk of MetS in LADA than in T1DM was partially attributable to higher insulin resistance in LADA.Copyright © 2019 Li, Cao, Tang, Yan, Zhou, Liu, Ji, Yang and Zhou.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664103>Association of Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone and Thyroid Hormones with Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Euthyroid Children and Adolescents Aged 10-18 Years: A Population-Based Study.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence indicates that low-normal thyroid function test results within the reference ranges may be related to increased cardiometabolic risk factors.

Serum PAF-AH, HDL-associated PAF-AH (HDL-PAF-AH), and LDL-associated PAF-AH (LDL-PAF-AH) were measured.In all patients, age, the percentages of males, and body mass index were 61.0 ± 8.8 years, 59.5% and 26.3 ± 3.4 kg/m, respectively. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-chol) were significantly decreased by ezetimibe monotherapy. Serum PAF-AH and LDL-PAF-AH were significantly decreased by ezetimibe monotherapy, whereas HDL-PAF-AH and HDL-CEC were not. There was no difference in the results of PAF-AH and HDL-CEC between MetS and non-MetS groups.Ezetimibe monotherapy might prevent coronary heart disease (CHD) regardless of the presence of MetS, because PAF-AH was independent risk factor for CHD.Copyright 2019, Tano et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642000> is a predictor of decreased renal function among community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly Japanese.</a></h2><p> (MetS) is increasing worldwide with the continuous increase in obesity prevalence. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also a major public health problem, but there is controversy over whether baseline MetS is a predictor of decreased renal function among Japanese community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly Japanese.We conducted a prospective cohort study designed as part of the Nomura study. We recruited a random sample of 410 men aged 68 ± 8 (mean ± standard deviation; range, 50-95) years and 549 women aged 69 ± 7 (50-84) years during their annual health examination in a single community. We examined the relationship between baseline MetS and renal dysfunction after a 3-year evaluation based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the CKD-EPI equations modified by the Japan coefficient. CKD was defined as dipstick-positive proteinuria (> or = 1 +) or a low eGFR (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m).Of the 959 participants, 413 (43.1%) had MetS at baseline. Annual eGFR decline rate was significantly greater in those with MetS than in those without MetS, and the annual eGFR decline rate of < - 1.2 mL/min/1.73 m/year increased significantly in relation to presence of baseline MetS, especially low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). Moreover, the incidence rate of CKD after 3 years was 13.5% and increased significantly in relation to presence of baseline MetS, especially its components such as elevated HbA1c. The multivariate-adjusted odd ratio (OR) for CKD in participants with MetS versus those without MetS was 1.55 (0.99-2.43). The multivariate-adjusted ORs for rapid annual eGFR decline rate were significantly high in patients aged ≥ 65 years and presence of medication, regardless of gender and eGFR value.Low HDL-C and elevated HbA1c levels correlated significantly with eGFR decline in a short period of 3 years. MetS also showed a significant association with eGFR decline. This study suggests the importance of low HDL-C and elevated HbA1c in the effect of MetS on eGFR decline rather than obesity among Japanese community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly Japanese without CKD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645009>Cardamonin suppresses lipogenesis by activating protein kinase A-mediated browning of 3T3-L1 cells.</a></h2><p>Obesity develops when dietary energy intake exceeds energy expenditure, and can be associated with . Recent studies have shown that dietary phytochemicals can promote energy expenditure by inducing the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT).This study investigated whether cardamonin induces the browning of 3T3-L1 adipocytes through the activation of protein kinase A (PKA).Anti-obesity potential of cardamonin was evaluated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Adipocyte-specific genes were observed using western blot, qPCR analysis and immunocytochemistry.Cardamonin treatment inhibited lipid droplet accumulation and reduced the expression of the adipogenic proteins C/EBPα and FABP4, and the lipogenic proteins LPAATθ, lipin 1, DGAT1, SREBP1, and FAS. Cardamonin also induced the expression of the browning marker genes PRDM16, PGC1α, and UCP1 at the mRNA and protein levels, and induced mRNA expression of CD137, a key marker of beige adipocytes. It also increased the expression of the β-oxidation genes CPT1 and PPARα at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, cardamonin increased PKA phosphorylation and the mRNA and protein expression of the downstream lipolytic enzymes adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).Our findings demonstrate novel effects of cardamonin to stimulate adipocyte browning, suppress lipogenesis, and promote lipolysis, implying it may have potential as an anti-obesity agent.Copyright © 2019.

Basic characteristics of this disease are hypertension, reduced concentration of aldosterone and renin activity, as well as increased excretion of potassium leading to low level of potassium in serum and  alkalosis. The cause of Liddle  is missense or frameshift mutations in SCNN1A, SCNN1B, or SCNN1G genes that encode epithelial sodium channel subunits.We describe a family with Liddle  from Russia. 15-year-old proband has arterial hypertension, hypokalemia, hyporeninemia,  alkalosis, but aldosterone level is within the normal range. At 12 years of age, arterial hypertension was noticed for the first time. We identified novel frameshift mutation c.1769delG (p.Gly590Alafs) in SCNN1G, which encodes the γ subunit of ENaC in vertebrates. The father and younger sister also harbor this heterozygous deletion. Treatment with amiloride of proband and his sister did not normalize the blood pressure, but normalized level of plasma renin activity.Our results expand the mutational spectrum of Liddle  and provide further proof that the conserved PY motif is crucial to control of ENaC activity. Genetic analysis has implications for the management of hypertension, specific treatment with amiloride and counselling in families with Liddle .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646703>Missense variants in TAF1 and developmental phenotypes: challenges of determining pathogenicity.</a></h2><p>We recently described a new neurodevelopmental  (TAF1/MRXS33 intellectual disability ) (MIM# 300966) caused by pathogenic variants involving the X-linked gene TAF1, which participates in RNA polymerase II transcription. The initial study reported eleven families, and the  was defined as presenting early in life with hypotonia, facial dysmorphia, and developmental delay that evolved into intellectual disability (ID) and/or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We have now identified an additional 27 families through a genotype-first approach. Familial segregation analysis, clinical phenotyping, and bioinformatics were capitalized on to assess potential variant pathogenicity, and molecular modelling was performed for those variants falling within structurally characterized domains of TAF1. A novel phenotypic clustering approach was also applied, in which the phenotypes of affected individuals were classified using 51 standardized Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. Phenotypes associated with TAF1 variants show considerable pleiotropy and clinical variability, but prominent among previously unreported effects were brain morphological abnormalities, seizures, hearing loss, and heart malformations. Our allelic series broadens the phenotypic spectrum of TAF1/MRXS33 intellectual disability  and the range of TAF1 molecular defects in humans. It also illustrates the challenges for determining the pathogenicity of inherited missense variants, particularly for genes mapping to chromosome X. This article is protected by copyright.

A number of studies have demonstrated that hundreds of non-coding RNAs, including miRNAs and lncRNAs, are involved in -related diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, etc. However, these research results are distributed in a large number of literature, which is not conducive to analysis and use. There is an urgent need to integrate these relationship data between  and non-coding RNA into a specialized database. To address this need, we developed a -associated non-coding RNA database (ncRNA2MetS) to curate the associations between  and non-coding RNA. Currently, ncRNA2MetS contains 1,068 associations between five  traits and 627 non-coding RNAs (543 miRNAs and 84 lncRNAs) in four species. Each record in ncRNA2MetS database represents a pair of disease-miRNA (lncRNA) association consisting of non-coding RNA category, miRNA (lncRNA) name, name of  trait, expressive patterns of non-coding RNA, method for validation, specie involved, a brief introduction to the association, the article referenced, etc. We also developed a user-friendly website so that users can easily access and download all data. In short, ncRNA2MetS is a complete and high-quality data resource for exploring the role of non-coding RNA in the pathogenesis of  and seeking new treatment options.

There are two independent serotonin systems in the body characterized by two isoforms of TPH, TPH1 and TPH2. While TPH2 synthesizes serotonin in the brain, TPH1 is expressed in the gut and in other peripheral tissues and supplies platelets in the circulation with serotonin. This duality of the serotonin system is enforced by the blood-brain barrier which is impermeable for serotonin. In the brain serotonin acts as neurotransmitter and is a main target for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. In the periphery it is released by platelets at the site of activation and elicits numerous physiological effects. TPH1 deficient mice were shown to be protected from diverse diseases including hemostatic, inflammatory, fibrotic, gastrointestinal, and  disorders and therefore serotonin synthesis inhibition emerged as a reasonable therapeutic paradigm. Recently the first TPH inhibitor, telotristat ethyl, came on the market for the treatment of carcinoid .

To better investigate RTT disease progression/pathogenesis animal models of Mecp2 deficiency have been developed. Here, Mecp2 mouse models are employed to investigate the role of protein patterns in RTT. A proteome analysis was carried out in brain tissue from i) Mecp2 deficient mice at the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages and, ii) mice in which the disease phenotype was reversed by Mecp2 reactivation. Several proteins were shown to be differentially expressed in the pre-symptomatic (n = 18) and symptomatic (n = 20) mice. Mecp2 brain reactivated mice showed wild-type comparable levels of expression for twelve proteins, mainly related to proteostasis (n = 4) and energy  pathways (n = 4). The remaining ones were found to be involved in redox homeostasis (n = 2), nitric oxide regulation (n = 1), neurodevelopment (n = 1). Ten out of twelve proteins were newly linked to Mecp2 deficiency. Our study sheds light on the relevance of the protein-regulation of main physiological process in the complex mechanisms leading from Mecp2 mutation to the RTT clinical phenotype. SIGNIFICANCE: We performed a proteomic study of a Mecp2 mouse model for Rett  (RTT) at the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic Mecp2 deficient mice stage and for the brain specific reactivated Mecp2 model. Our results reveal major protein expression changes pointing out to defects in proteostasis or energy  pathways other than, to a lesser extent, in redox homeostasis, nitric oxide regulation or neurodevelopment. The Mecp2 mouse rescued model provides the possibility to select target proteins more susceptible to the Mecp2 gene mutation, potential and promising therapeutical targets.Copyright © 2019.

This study aimed to establish the longitudinal relationship between cluster patterns of childhood behavioural RFs and adult cardio- RFs. Data were from an Australian prospective cohort study of 1265 participants measured in 1985 (ages 9-15 yrs), and in 2004-06 (ages 26-36 yrs). At baseline, children self-reported smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity (PA), dietary behaviour and psychological well-being. At follow-up, participants completed questionnaires and attended study clinics where the following component indicators of the  (MetS) score were measured: waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and lipids. TwoStep cluster analyses were carried out to identify clusters in childhood. Linear regression was used to examine the longitudinal associations between cluster patterns of childhood behavioural RFs and adult cardio- RFs. Four childhood cluster patterns of behavioural RFs labelled 'most healthy', 'high PA', 'most unhealthy', and 'breakfast skippers' were identified. The unhealthier childhood clusters predicted a significantly higher adult MetS score ('most unhealthy': β = 0.10, 95%CI = 0.01, 0.19) and adult waist circumference ('most unhealthy': β = 2.29, 95%CI = 0.90, 6.67; 'breakfast skippers': β = 2.15, 95%CI = 0.30, 4.00). These associations were independent of adult behavioural RFs and socio-economic position. These findings emphasise the impact of multiple childhood behavioural RFs on important adult health outcomes and may be useful for the development of early intervention strategies, where identification of children at higher risk of poorer adult cardio- health is vital.Copyright © 2018.

Evidence has shown that physical activity can positively impact age-related health conditions, yet exercise trials in older adults with mental disorders are rare. Our study was a tailored and targeted pilot exercise intervention for older veterans with PTSD.Fifty-four older veterans with PTSD (mean age = 67.4 years, 90.7% male, 85.2% non-white) were randomized to supervised exercise (n=38) or wait-list usual care (WL; n=18) for 12 weeks. Physical activity (MET-min/wk) and aerobic endurance (assessed with the 6-minute walk test), were primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were physical performance (strength, mobility, balance), cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g., waist circumference), and health-related quality of life.At 12 weeks, a large effect of the intervention on physical activity levels (Cohen's d=1.37) was observed compared to WL. Aerobic endurance improved by 69 meters in the exercise group compared to 10 meters in WL, reflecting a moderate between-group effect (Cohen's d=.50). Between-group differences on 12-week changes in physical performance, cardiometabolic risk factors, and health-related quality of life ranged from small to large effects (Cohen's d=.28-1.48), favoring the exercise arm.Participation in supervised exercise improved aerobic endurance, physical performance, and health-related clinical factors in older veterans with PTSD; a medically complex population with multiple morbidity. Group exercise is a low-cost, low-stigma intervention and implementation efforts among older veterans with PTSD warrants further consideration.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America 2019.

The mechanisms by which maternal obesity can induce alterations in fetal and later neonatal metabolism are not fully elucidated due to its complexity and multifactorial causes. Two adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, are involved in fetal and postnatal growth trajectories, and both are altered in women with pregestational obesity. The placenta synthesizes leptin, which goes mainly to the maternal circulation and in lesser amount to the developing fetus. Maternal pregestational obesity and hyperleptinemia are associated with placental dysfunction and changes in nutrient transporters which directly affect fetal growth and development. By the other side, the embryo can produce its own leptin from early in development, which is associated to fetal weight and adiposity. Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, is downregulated in maternal obesity. High molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin is the most abundant form and with most biological actions. In maternal obesity lower total and HMW adiponectin levels have been described in the mother, paralleled with high levels in the umbilical cord. Several studies have found that cord blood adiponectin levels are related with postnatal growth trajectories, and it has been suggested that low adiponectin levels in women with pregestational obesity enhance placental insulin sensitivity and activation of placental amino acid transport systems, supporting fetal overgrowth. The possible mechanisms by which maternal pregestational obesity, focusing in the actions of leptin and adiponectin, affects the fetal development and postnatal growth trajectories in their offspring are discussed.Copyright © 2019.

Current research has shown that hepatic fatty acid accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway. Mitochondria are the major sites of fatty acid β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of fatty acids. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty acid-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty acid accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance.

In addition, the study aims at describing how these characteristics are distributed across PCOS phenotypes and at detecting associations with regional demographic and lifestyle aspects, genetic variants, and epigenetic markers.The Brazilian PCOS study is being conducted in the outpatient clinics of eight university hospitals within the public healthcare network (Unified Health System) across the country. Additional centres will be included following completion of the research ethics approval process. The sample includes women with PCOS according to Rotterdam criteria at inclusion in the study and a control group of healthy women matched by age, socioeconomic status and geographical region. Data will be collected in each centre and incorporated into a unified cloud database. Clinical, demographic, socioeconomic, psychological, , epigenetic and genotypic variables will be evaluated. The data resulting from this study will be useful to guide specific public strategies for primary and secondary prevention of  and reproductive comorbidities in the PCOS population of Brazil.The study protocol was approved by each local Research Ethics Committee. Written informed consent will be obtained from each participant. During data collection, analysis and publication, care will be taken to ensure confidentiality of participant information. Study results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated at international conferences.

Logistic regression was used to examine the cross-sectional association between obesity phenotypes (metabolically healthy without obesity [MHNO; reference], metabolically unhealthy without obesity, MHO, and metabolically unhealthy obesity) with ECG markers (PR interval, P-wave duration, QRS duration, and QT interval).Higher odds of prolonged PR interval, P-wave duration, and QRS duration were observed among all phenotypes compared with MHNO, with the highest in participants with obesity with or without . However, for QT interval, the trend of association with obesity phenotypes was as follows, from the strongest to the least strong: metabolically unhealthy obesity, metabolically healthy without obesity, and then MHO, compared with MHNO.An association of obesity phenotypes with ECG abnormalities further raises doubt about the concept of MHO as a healthy state. Variations in associations with ECG markers may suggest that  and obesity have a different relationship with different CVD outcomes and may explain some of the inconsistent CVD estimates for MHO.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663988>Duration of reproductive years and time since menopause were associated with  in postmenopausal parous women of Chinese ancestry.</a></h2><p>Although duration of reproductive years and time since menopause were previously implicated in the , the evidence is more limited.

Few studies have focused on physical health outcomes for those prescribed long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics. This observational cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of  (MetS) and other cardio- risk factors in a large cohort prescribed LAI and managed by community mental health services. For participants with elevated cardio- risk factors, the proportion receiving appropriate management was assessed. Of the 301 eligible participants, many met the full criteria for MetS (44%) and its components. Cardio- risk factors were largely under- or un-treated. Smoking rates were very high (62%) along with reported high rates of physical inactivity and poor dietary intake. The vast majority (89%) reported seeing their general practitioner in the preceding twelve months. Individuals prescribed LAI have a very high prevalence of MetS and potentially modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Routine monitoring accompanied by evidence-based treatment of cardiometabolic abnormalities which contribute to significant morbidity, disability and premature death should be prioritised. Better collaboration between mental health services and primary care providers should be pursued to optimise the delivery of effective physical health care to individuals living with SMI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

At the vascular level, T presents genomic and non-genomic effects, and both effects may overlap. The genomic actions assume that androgens can freely cross the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to nuclear androgen receptors, inducing gene transcription and protein synthesis. The non-genomic effects have a more rapid onset and may be related to the interaction with protein/receptor/ion channels of the plasma membrane. The key T effect at the vascular level is vasorelaxation, which is primarily due to its rapid effect. Thus, the main purpose of this review is to discuss the T non-genomic effects at the vascular level and the molecular pathways involved in its vasodilator effect observed in in vivo and in vitro studies. In this sense, the nuclear receptor activation, the influence of vascular endothelium and the activation or inhibition of ion channels (potassium and calcium channels, respectively) will be reviewed regarding all the data that corroborated or not. Moreover, this review also provides a brief update on the association of T with the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, namely , type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, atherosclerosis, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension. In summary, in this paper we consider the non-genomic vascular mode of action of androgen in physiological conditions and the main risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Sterculic acid has been proposed as a potential tool for the treatment of MS since it inhibits the activity of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a central enzyme in lipid metabolism. We analyzed the effect of sterculic oil (SO) co-administration with 30% fructose in drinking water on the development of MS in male Wistar rats.

Bile flowing from the liver is concentrated in the gallbladder and, in response to a meal, released into the upper intestine. In the intestines, bile acids act as detergents and help to emulsify fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. After participating in digestion in the small bowel, bile acids are almost completely (95%) reabsorbed in the distal ileum and then retaken up from portal blood by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The primary bile acids synthesized in the liver are cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid which are typically conjugated to glycine or taurine before secretion. In the intestine, the primary bile acids are often converted by colonic bacteria to the secondary bile acids, predominantly deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid. The reabsorbed bile acids are transported to the liver in portal blood. Conjugated bile acids are then retaken up by hepatocytes via the sodium taurocholate cotransporter (NTCT), while unconjugated bile acids are taken up by organic anion transporters that also take up bilirubin and other anions. The total bile acid pool in humans is tightly controlled by a coordinated regulation of expression of genes involved with synthesis, secretion, reabsorption and reuptake of bile acids by the liver. The major components of the bile acid pool are cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid with lesser amounts deoxycholic and lithocholic acid and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic acid. Bile acids also act as signaling molecules and are important in regulation of their own synthesis, uptake and secretion as well as control of cholesterol synthesis and regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. Bile acid levels are increased in the serum and liver in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholestasis and, perhaps because of their inherent detergent activities, can cause hepatocyte injury. Thus, increased bile acid levels in hepatocytes may account for some of the liver damage in cholestatic liver diseases. Bile acids can be used as therapeutic agents, particularly in patients with cholestatic liver diseases where administered bile acids (such as ursodeoxycholic acid) replace the more lipophilic and toxic bile acids that accumulate during cholestasis. Bile acids are also useful for the medical treatment (dissolution) of gallstones by increasing bile acid and decreasing cholesterol concentrations in bile (causing a less saturated bile). Bile acids can also be useful as replacement therapy in patients with bile acid synthetic defects. Finally, the other  effects of bile acids can be useful in treating  diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Four bile acids are currently approved for use in the United States and several others are under active investigation. Cholic acid is used for treatment of inherited defects in bile acid synthesis, chenodeoxycholic (chenodiol) and ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol) acid for gallstone dissolution, and obeticholic and ursodiol for chronic cholestatic liver diseases, specifically primary biliary cirrhosis. Obeticholic acid is under evaluation as therapy of other liver diseases including sclerosing cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Ursodiol is used off label to prevent, treat or ameliorate several uncommon forms of liver disease, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, sinusoidal obstruction , graft-vs-host disease, cystic fibrosis associated liver disease, parenteral nutrition related liver injury and even acute, drug induced liver injury. The long term efficacy in ameliorating the course of these diseases is, however, unproven. Separate documents are available in LiverTox for each of the currently available bile acids.

Weight gain increases the patient's risk of recurrent stroke and chronic diseases, such as diabetes, , and pulmonary and heart disease. Approaches to weight loss in this population are lacking, although necessary because of the unique physiological and cognitive needs of persons after a stroke. Evidence shows that intensive behavioral therapy interventions that address both physical activity and diet offer the greatest potential for weight loss.

Few studies have addressed the role of leptin in hypothyroid prediabetic patients and its effect on CHD risk factors.The aim of this study was to detect serum levels of leptin in hypothyroid prediabetic patients and their relationship with risk factors for CHD.The study included three groups; group A included 120 hypothyroid male patients with normal glucose tolerance, group B included 120 hypothyroid male patients with prediabetes, and group C included 120 healthy individuals matched for age and sex as a control group. All groups were subjected to assessment of history, clinical examination, and laboratory investigations including fasting and 2 h postprandial blood glucose, serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), free T3, free T4, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and fasting serum leptin.Serum leptin was significantly higher in groups A and B compared with group C (=0.0001), whereas there was no significant difference in serum leptin between groups A and B. In comparison with group A, the patients in group B had significantly higher serum TC (=0.02), LDL (=0.04), and lower serum HDL (=0.02). In group B, serum leptin correlated positively with serum TC (=0.0001), TG (=0.041), and LDL (=0.036), and negatively with serum HDL (=0.039).Hypothyroidism is associated with high serum leptin independent of prediabetic state.

The discrepancy suggests a methodical shortcoming: due to the influence of physical activity, the standard measuring of HRV at rest is not comparable with HRV assessment based on 24h Holter monitoring, which is preferred because of its comprehensiveness. To obtain a more reliable measure and to clarify to what extent HRV is altered in MetS, we assessed a 24h HRV before and after the elimination of the influence of physical activity.  We investigated 69  (MetS) and 37 control subjects, aged 50-55. In all subjects, 24h monitoring of electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and actigraphy profiles were conducted. To eliminate the influence of day-time physical activity on RR intervals (RRI), a linear polynomial autoregressive model with exogenous terms (ARX) was used. Standard spectral RRI analysis was performed.  Subjects with MetS had blunted HRV; the diurnal SDNN index was reliably lower in the MetS group than in control subjects. The elimination of the influence of physical activity did not reveal a significant HRV change in long-term indices (SDNN, SDANN, and SD2), whilst adjacent RRI values (RMSSD, pNN50, and SD1) and SDNN index significantly increased ( < 0.001). An increase in the latter indices highlighted the HRV difference between the MetS and control groups; a significant ( < 0.001) decrease of all short-term HRV variables was found in the MetS group ( < 0.01), and low-frequency spectral components were less pronounced in the MetS group.

When nine combinations of 25-OHD and Ca tertiles were examined, certain combinations were associated with reduced AOR for elevated TG (<0.001), when referenced against the combination of low 25-OHD (median: 33 nmol/l) and low Ca (median: 579 mg/day). At low 25-OHD, increasing Ca intake decreased the AOR for low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner, but at high 25-OHD; such effects of Ca were blunted.Higher vitamin D status and Ca intake or their combination were associated with reduced odds for a number of individual MetS components.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Familial clustering of PCOS symptoms is well documented, providing evidence for a genetic contribution to the condition. This overview aims firstly to systematically summarise the current literature surrounding genetics and PCOS, and secondly, to assess the methodological quality of current systematic reviews and identify limitations. Four databases were searched to identify candidate gene systematic reviews, and quality was assessed with the AMSTAR tool. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were identified by a semi structured literature search. Of the candidate gene systematic reviews, 17 were of high to moderate quality and four were of low quality. A total of 19 gene loci have been associated with risk of PCOS in GWAS, and 11 of these have been replicated across two different ancestries. Gene loci were located in the neuroendocrine, , and reproductive pathways. Overall, the gene loci with the most robust findings were , and , that now require validation. This overview also identified limitations of the current literature and important methodological considerations for future genetic studies.

Yet, very limited is known about the prevalence and risk factors associated with MetS in Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study was conducted among adult outpatients (N = 325) at St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The study was conducted in accordance with STEPwise approach of the World Health Organization. MetS was defined using modified National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.The overall prevalence of MetS was 20.3%. Among the 325 participants, 76.9% had at least one MetS components. Reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was the most common MetS component at 48.6%, followed by elevated blood pressure at 36.3%, and elevated fasting glucose at 32.6%.

This condition is accompanied by an extensive series of relatively serious neuropsychiatric symptoms. The diagnosis of PANS is made by "exclusion", as the individual PANS symptoms overlap with a multiplicity of psychiatric disorders with onset in childhood. Several researchers accumulated evidence to support the hypothesis that PANS was closely associated with a variety of infections. In the last decade, metabolomics played an essential role in improving the knowledge of complex biological systems and identifying potential new biomarkers, as indicators of pathological progressions, or pharmacologic responses to therapy. The metabolome is considered the most predictive phenotype, capable to catch epigenetic differences, reflecting more closely the clinical reality at any given moment and thus providing extremely dynamic data. In the present work, we review the most recent hypothesis and suggested mechanisms of this condition and describe the case of a 10 year -year-old girl with PANS, before and after clarithromycin treatment. The main results of this case report are discussed from a metabolomics point of view. The alteration of several  pathways concerning the microbial activity highlights the possible role of the microbiome in the development of PANS. Furthermore, different  perturbations at the level of the protein biosynthesis, energy and amino acid metabolisms were observed and discussed. Based on our observations, we believe that metabolomics is a promising technology to unravel the mysteries of PANS in the near future.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641677>The Effect of an Education Program Based on Illness Perception on the Lifestyle of Patients with : A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to examine the effects of an education program based on illness perceptions on the lifestyle of patients with .This is a randomized controlled clinical trial on 80 patients with  referred to diabetic clinic affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences from August to November 2016.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered to be a phenotype of Mets in the liver. Although there have been some reports of the association between NAFLD and light alcohol consumption (LAC), the association between Mets-related diseases and LAC in the subjects with and without fatty liver is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the influence of LAC on Mets-related diseases in individuals with and those without fatty liver. This study included 1,190 men who underwent regular health check-ups and consumed <20 g/day of alcohol. The subjects were divided into two groups, the non-fatty liver group and fatty liver group, and investigated the association between Mets-related diseases and LAC. Fatty liver was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound. The effect of LAC was different between the non-fatty liver and fatty liver groups. In the non-fatty liver group, the odds ratio (OR) for hypertension was 1.73 (1.04-2.88;2 P=0.035).

This trend is driven largely by the recent surge in incidence of , non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Given the central role of the liver in lipid homeostasis, altered hepatic lipid metabolism has been identified as a contributing factor to hepatocellular carcinoma. Neoplastic cells are highly dependent on lipid metabolism as a source of energy and to support rapid cell division, and fatty acid derivatives play key roles in cell signaling. Aberrant expression of liver fatty acid–binding protein and changes in the ratio of saturated to unsaturated triacylglycerols have been shown to be associated with disease severity and subtype. This chapter focuses on  reprogramming and dysregulation of lipid metabolism as hallmarks of hepatocellular carcinoma.Copyright: The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628414>Hematopoietic Npc1 mutation shifts gut microbiota composition in Ldlr mice on a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet.</a></h2><p>While the link between diet-induced changes in gut microbiota and lipid metabolism in  (MetS) has been established, the contribution of host genetics is rather unexplored. As several findings suggested a role for the lysosomal lipid transporter Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) in macrophages during MetS, we here explored whether a hematopoietic Npc1 mutation, induced via bone marrow transplantation, influences gut microbiota composition in low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (Ldlr) mice fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol (HFC) diet for 12 weeks. Ldlr mice fed a HFC diet mimic a human plasma lipoprotein profile and show features of MetS, providing a model to explore the role of host genetics on gut microbiota under MetS conditions. Fecal samples were used to profile the microbial composition by 16 s ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The hematopoietic Npc1 mutation shifted the gut microbiota composition and increased microbial richness and diversity. Variations in plasma lipid levels correlated with microbial diversity and richness as well as with several bacterial genera. This study suggests that host genetic influences on lipid metabolism affect the gut microbiome under MetS conditions. Future research investigating the role of host genetics on gut microbiota might therefore lead to identification of diagnostic and therapeutic targets for MetS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634983>Profiles of Advanced Hepatic Fibrosis Evaluated by FIB-4 index and Shear Wave Elastography in Health Check-up Examinees.</a></h2><p>Advanced hepatic fibrosis is seen in individuals with potential hepatocellular carcinoma and cardiovascular disease. Hepatic fibrosis can be assessed using a combination of FIB-4 index and imaging modalities, including shear wave elastography (SWE). We aimed to investigate the prevalence of advanced fibrosis in the general population and the profiles associated with advanced fibrosis using a data-mining analysis.We enrolled 1,155 health check-up examinees (median age 53 years, female/male 685/470). Advanced fibrosis was defined by FIB-4 index ≥1.3 and liver stiffness ≥8.07 kPa using SWE. Subjects were classified as Normal-Mild fibrosis (n=1,035) or Advanced fibrosis (n=120). Factors associated with advanced fibrosis were analyzed by logistic regression and decision-tree analyses.Advanced fibrosis was observed in 10.4% of subjects (120/1,155). In the logistic regression analysis, independent factors for advanced fibrosis were age (≥75 years) (OR 2.12; 95%CI 1.021-4.415; P=0.0419) and presence of  (OR 2.51; 95%CI 1.416-4.462; P=0.0017).

The CHADS-VASc score does not account for the MetS components of prehypertension, prediabetes mellitus, abdominal obesity, elevated triglycerides, and low HDL (high-density lipoprotein). Data are limited on the association of MetS with stroke in AF, independent of CHADS-VASc variables. Our aim was to identify MetS components associated with ischemic stroke in participants with AF in the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities). Methods- We included 1172 participants with incident AF within 5 years of measurement of MetS components. MetS was defined by ATP criteria and International Diabetes Federation criteria. Incident ischemic stroke was physician adjudicated. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association of MetS components with stroke. Results- After a median follow-up of 14.8 years, there were 113 ischemic stroke cases. Of the individual MetS components, low HDL was borderline associated with increased stroke risk (hazard ratio, 1.48 [95% CI, 0.99-2.21]) after adjustment for CHADS-VASc variables while the remaining MetS variables were not associated with stroke risk. The presence of ≥3 components of MetS was not significantly associated with ischemic stroke after adjustment for CHADS-VASc variables (hazard ratio, 1.38 [95% CI, 0.91-2.11]). The risk of stroke increased by 13% for each additional component of MetS; however, this association was borderline significant (hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.99-1.28]). Conclusions- The presence of MetS was not significantly associated with ischemic stroke after adjustment for CHADS-VASc variables.

We evaluated their roles in first hospitalization or all-cause mortality prediction in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients.From January to December 2012, 115 CAD patients were enrolled from a single center and followed up for 5.5 years. The composite endpoint included hospitalization for unstable angina, myocardial infarction, revascularization, or heart failure and all-cause mortality. Patients with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity > 10 m/s (measured using applanation tonometry) constituted the high AS group.During a median 54-month follow-up, there were 43 (37.4%) and 11 (9.6%) hospitalization and mortality events, respectively. Overall, 41 (35.7%) and 70 (60.9%) patients were diagnosed with AS and MetS, respectively. CAD patients with high AS had higher diabetes and MetS percentages, were older, and had higher waist circumference and systolic blood pressure (SBP) but lower glomerular filtration rate than those with low AS. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed old age ( < 0.001), diabetes ( = 0.003), and high waist circumference ( = 0.044) and SBP ( = 0.007) as independent predictors of AS in CAD patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that CAD patients with concurrent MetS and high AS had a higher risk for hospitalization (log rank test,  = 0.005) or developing all-cause mortality (log rank test,  = 0.002). Compared with CAD patients without MetS or AS, composite outcome development risk in those with both the conditions was 10.2-fold higher ( < 0.001); this risk was 6.54-fold higher in those with AS alone ( = 0.007).In CAD patients, age, diabetes, and high waist circumference and SBP are the independent predictors of AS.

Oxidative and nitrosative stresses originating from mitochondrial dysfunctions could become the pathological biosignatures for increased cell apoptosis/necrosis, nonhyperglycemic , multiple neoantigen formation, and immune dysregulation in patients with SLE. Recently, many authors noted that the cross-talk between oxidative stress and ncRNAs can trigger and perpetuate autoimmune reactions in patients with SLE. Intracellular interactions between miR and lncRNAs as well as extracellular exosomal ncRNA communication to and fro between remote cells/tissues via plasma or other body fluids also occur in the body. The urinary exosomal ncRNAs can now represent biosignatures for lupus nephritis. Herein, we'll briefly review and discuss the cross-talk between excessive oxidative/nitrosative stress induced by mitochondrial dysfunction in tissues/cells and ncRNAs, as well as the prospect of antioxidant therapy in patients with SLE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646127> clinic for individuals with HIV/AIDS: a commitment and vision to the future of HIV services.</a></h2><p>One of the biggest current challenges in managing an ageing cohort living with the HIV is handling dyslipidaemia, diabetes,  and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Combination antiretroviral therapy decrease mortality and morbidity in HIV patients, but lead to increase in insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, abnormalities of fat distribution and high risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, a  clinic was established for individuals living with HIV in the Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. The clinic meets considerable demands by service users and hence has the potential to be popular. This review focuses on the importance of the development of a  clinic for the purpose of audit, research, teaching and exchange of knowledge between HIV specialists and the  team in the management of complex cases. Therefore, the  clinic should be an integral part of HIV services especially as the cohort of the 'older' HIV population increases.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The present study aimed to propose a novel indicator, the children's lipid accumulation product (CLAP), and to assess its association with MS among Chinese children and adolescents.A total of 683 Chinese children aged 8-15 years were recruited using a stratified cluster sampling method in this cross-sectional study. The presence of MS was defined according to the NCEP-ATP III criteria. The effects of BMI, WHtR and the CLAP for predicting MS were compared using logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.The prevalence of MS was 5.1% (6.6% and 3.5% among boys and girls, respectively). Overall obesity (based on BMI), abdominal obesity (based on WHtR) and CLAP≥P75 were significantly associated with an increased risk of MS (ORs (95% CIs) were 143.79 (18.78-1101.22), 86.83 (27.19-277.27), 150.75 (20.11-1130.19), respectively).

A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. As insulin resistance is closely associated with , this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body insulin sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting fatty-acid β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651856>Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as a predictive marker of .</a></h2><p>Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) serves as a strong prognostic indicator for patients suffering from various diseases. Neutrophil activation promotes the recruitment of a number of different cell types that are involved in acute and chronic inflammation and are associated with cancer treatment outcome. Measurement of NLR, an established inflammation marker, is cost-effective, and it is likely that NLR can be used to predict the development of  (MS) at an early stage. MS scores range from 1 to 5, and an elevated MS score indicates a greater risk for MS. Monitoring NLR can prevent the risk of MS.A total of 34,013 subjects were enrolled in this study. The subjects (score 0-5) within the 6 groups were classified according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) criteria, and all anthropometrics, laboratory biomarkers, and hematological measurements were recorded. For the 6 groups, statistical analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify the development of MS.Analysis of the ROC curve indicated that NLR served as a good predictor for MS. An MS score of 1 to 2 yielded an acceptable discrimination rate, and these rates were even higher for MS scores of 3 to 5 (P < .001), where the prevalence of MS was 30.8%.NLR can be used as a prognostic marker for several diseases, including those associated with MS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662283>Associations of a  severity score with coronary heart disease and diabetes in fasting vs. non-fasting individuals.</a></h2><p>Many traditional assessments of risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and diabetes require laboratory studies performed after an 8-h fast. We assessed whether  (MetS) severity would remain linked to future CHD and diabetes even when assessed from non-fasting samples.Participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study were assessed at 4 visits and followed for 20-years of adjudicated CHD outcomes. We used Cox proportional-hazard models (for 20-year CHD outcomes) and logistic regression (for 9-year diabetes outcomes) to compare incident disease risk associated with a race/ethnicity-specific MetS-severity Z-score (MetS-Z) calculated in participants who were fasting (≥8 h) or non-fasting. All analyses were adjusted for sex, race, education, income and smoking. MetS Z-scores were overall similar between participants who were always fasting vs. those non-fasting at Visits 1-3 (all values -0.1 to 0.4), while MetS-Z for participants who were non-fasting at Visit-4 were higher at each visit. Baseline MetS-Z was linked to future CHD when calculated from both fasting and non-fasting measurements, with hazard ratio (HR) for fasting MetS-Z 1.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42, 1.66) and for non-fasting 1.28 (CI 1.08, 1.51). MetS-Z at Visit-1 also remained linked to future diabetes when measured from non-fasting samples, with odds ratio for fasting MetS-Z 3.10 (CI 2.88, 3.35) and for non-fasting 1.92 (CI 1.05, 3.51).MetS-Z remained linked to future CHD and diabetes when assessed from non-fasting samples.

However, few studies have examined the impact of MetS on the postoperative complications of colorectal cancer and the conclusions remain controversial. The present study aimed to investigate whether MetS, as defined based on visceral fat area (VFA) instead of BMI or waist circumference, would predict complications after surgery for rectal cancer.We conducted a retrospective study of patients who underwent surgery for rectal cancer at our department between January 2013 and August 2018. Univariate and multivariate analyses evaluating the risk factors for postoperative complications were performed. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the gender-specific cut-off values for VFA.A total of 381 patients were included in the study. The optimal cut-off values for VFA were 117.9 cm for men and 76.9 cm for women, and 153 patients were diagnosed as having MetS. The rate of postoperative complication was significantly higher in the MetS group than that in the non-MetS group (34.6% versus 15.8%, P < 0.001).

These infants have an uncertain long-term outcome and it is currently unclear around time of diagnosis, which infants are at higher risk of later fulfilling a CF diagnosis. In this study, we hypothesised that immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels, used in NBS as a marker of pancreatic disease and function, may reflect the degree of CFTR dysfunction in each individual and therefore would help to identify those with CRMS/CSPID who are later at risk for meeting the criteria of CF.In this longitudinal, prospective study, infants with CRMS/CFSPID and CF were recruited and followed in 9 CF clinics (Canada and Italy). We compared NBS IRT levels between CF and CRMS/CFSPID, and between children with CRMS/CFSPID→CF and CRMS/CFSPID→CRMS/CFSPID during the period of June 2007 to April 2016.Ninety eight CRMS/CFSPID and 120 CF subjects were enrolled. During the study period, 14 (14.3%) CRMS/CFSPID subjects fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for CF (CRMS/CFSPID→CF), while the diagnosis remained uncertain (CRMS/CFSPID→ CRMS/CFSPID) in 84 (85.7%) subjects.

Infants with CRMS/CFSPID→CF (n = 14) had significantly higher NBS IRT concentrations (ng/ml) than CRMS/CFSPID→ CRMS/CFSPID (n = 83) (median (interquartile range): 108.9 (72.3-126.8) vs. 73.7(60.0-96.0); P = 0.02).Amongst infants who tested positive on NBS for CF, there is a gradation of elevated NBS IRT concentrations. Infants with CF have higher NBS IRT levels than CRMS/CFPSID, and higher NBS IRT concentrations were present in infants with CRMS/CFSPID→CF than CRMS/CFSPID→ CRMS/CFSPID.

A 4D Flow MRI sequence (phase-contrast vastly under sampled isotropic projection imaging) measured intracranial arterial flow in the Circle of Willis. Linear mixed-effects regression models estimated relationships between risk factors and intracranial arterial flow and tested interactions with racial group, APOE genotype, and AD biomarkers, with separate models per risk factor.Higher fasting glucose was associated with lower intracranial arterial flow; no additional relationships between flow and risk factors were observed. Main effects of racial group were observed, without an interaction, indicating lower flow in African Americans compared to Whites. In race-stratified analyses, higher glucose and triglycerides were associated with lower flow for African Americans, but not for Whites. No main effects or interactions among risk factors, APOE, or AD biomarkers, and flow were observed.Elevated fasting glucose and triglycerides were associated with lower intracranial arterial flow; these relationships were more prominent in African Americans. Targeting  risk factors may impact intracranial arterial health.

Here we report a patient with a severe, multisystem  disorder who inherited two copies of chromosome 12 from her father. He was a heterozygous carrier of a variant in the muscle-specific enzyme 6-phosphofructokinase (PFKM) gene, and of a truncating variant in the pseudouridine synthase 1 (PUS1) gene (both on chromosome 12), resulting in a homozygous state of these mutations in his daughter. The PFKM gene functions in glycolysis and is linked to Tarui . The PUS1 gene functions in mitochondrial tRNA processing and is linked to myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA). Analysis of human dermal fibroblasts, which do not express PFKM, revealed a loss of PUS1 mRNA and PUS1 protein only in the patient cells compared to healthy controls. The patient cells also revealed a reduction of the mitochondrial-encoded protein MTCO1 while levels of the nuclear-encoded SDHA remained unchanged, suggesting a specific impairment of mitochondrial translation. Further destabilization of these cells is suggested by the altered levels of BAX, BCL-2, and TP53 proteins, alterations that become augmented upon exposure of the cells to DNA damage. The results illustrate the efficacy of UPiD events to reveal rare pathogenic variants in human disease, and demonstrate how these events can lead to cellular destabilization.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641249>Genetic contributions to NAFLD: leveraging shared genetics to uncover systems biology.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects around a quarter of the global population, paralleling worldwide increases in obesity and .

While studies of animals that became extinct can be informative, it is the survivors that provide clues for mechanisms of adaptation when conditions are adverse. Here we describe a survival pathway used by many species as a means for providing adequate fuel and water, while also providing protection from a decrease in oxygen availability. Fructose, whether supplied in the diet (primarily fruits and honey), or endogenously (via activation of the polyol pathway) preferentially shifts the organism towards the storing of fuel (fat, glycogen) that can be used to provide energy and water at a later date. Fructose causes sodium retention and raises blood pressure and likely helped survival in the setting of dehydration or salt deprivation. By shifting energy production from the mitochondria to glycolysis, fructose reduced oxygen demands to aid survival in situations where oxygen availability is low. The actions of fructose are driven in part by vasopressin and the generation of uric acid. Twice in history, mutations occurred during periods of mass extinction that enhanced the activity of fructose to generate fat, with the first being a mutation in vitamin C metabolism during the Cretaceous Paleogene Extinction (65 million years ago) and the second being a mutation in uricase that occurred during the Middle Miocene Disruption (12-14 million years ago). Today, the excessive intake of fructose due to the availability of refined sugar and high fructose corn syrup is driving "burden of life style" diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure.© 2019 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646122>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: implications for cardiovascular risk.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing epidemic in the USA affecting ∼30% of the population.

Oestrogen injections induced FLHS, but the incidence and severity of the condition was increased with a combination of E & LPS. Hepatic mRNA levels of the genes encoding key regulators of inflammation such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) were evaluated. The expression of IL-6 mRNA in hepatocytes of all treated groups (E, LPS and E & LPS hens) was elevated from 6 to 56 fold (< 0.01), when compared to baseline and control values, with the highest fold change at 3 h post-treatment. The mRNA levels for IL-1β were better expressed at 24 h post-treatments with E, LPS and E & LPS. The expression of IL-18 mRNA in the liver tissue was lower than IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA in all treated birds. At 24 h post-treatments, total white blood cell (WBC) counts and fibrinogen levels were elevated (< 0.05) in E, LPS and E & LPS treated hens. Histologically, livers of hens from E and E & LPS treated groups revealed inflammatory alterations with areas showing mononuclear aggregations, vacuolar fatty degeneration of hepatocytes, and increased sinusoidal congestion and haemorrhages. It was concluded that liver lipid accumulation and injury were associated with incidences of local (hepatic) and systemic inflammation, which could have initiated liver blood vessel and capsule rupture and subsequently the onset of FLHS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635469>Serum markers in diagnostics of steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Along with the increasing incidence and prevalence of obesity and the , the number of patients with its hepatic manifestation - NAFL, characterized by triglyceride storage in liver, is rising. NAFL (non-alcoholic fatty liver) is now, with the prevalence of 40 %, the most common liver disease in Western countries. Despite that NAFL has usually no symptoms and in most patients, it is diagnosed as an incidental finding by abdominal ultra-sound, every third of these patients develops NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), resulting in an individual progression of the sequence of fibrosis - cirrhosis - hepatocellular carcinoma. Due to the fact, that NASH is, along with the cardiovascular causes, involved in liver-related mortality of patients with the , from clinical view, it is fundamental to distinguish between benign NAFL and potentially progressive NASH. This appears even more serious realizing that patients with NASH are being often underdiagnosed because of limited indications of liver biopsy, a common diagnostically gold standard. This work emphasizes the relationship between  and liver disease and presents the main diagnostic possibilities of NAFL/NASH, the most dealing with serum markers. It is based on a research, using the PubMed database and putting the key words as search terms. Considering the huge number of patients diagnosed with fatty liver, a non-invasive, widely approachable method should be established, to make the diagnostic and staging of progression of NASH broadly possible.

To determine the underlying mechanism for impaired bone formation, we modelled the disease by silencing SMS in human bone marrow - derived multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) derived from healthy donors. We found that silencing SMS in MSCs led to reduced cell proliferation and deficient bone formation in vitro, as evidenced by reduced mineralization and decreased bone sialoprotein expression. Furthermore, transplantation of MSCs in osteoconductive scaffolds into immune deficient mice shows that silencing SMS also reduces ectopic bone formation in vivo. Tag-Seq Gene Expression Profiling shows that deficient SMS expression causes strong transcriptome changes, especially in genes related to cell proliferation and  functions. Similarly, metabolome analysis by mass spectrometry, shows that silencing SMS strongly impacts glucose metabolism. This was consistent with observations using electron microscopy, where SMS deficient MSCs show high levels of mitochondrial fusion. In line with these findings, SMS deficiency causes a reduction in glucose consumption and increase in lactate secretion. Our data also suggests that SMS deficiency affects iron metabolism in the cells, which we hypothesize is linked to deficient mitochondrial function. Altogether, our studies suggest that SMS deficiency causes strong transcriptomic and  changes in MSCs, which are likely associated with the observed impaired osteogenesis both in vitro and in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636376>The Iberian pig fed with high-fat diet: a model of renal disease in obesity and .</a></h2><p>The pathogenesis of renal disease in the context of overweight/obesity, , and insulin resistance is not completely understood.

Animals on HFD showed "diabetoid changes", including mesangial expansion [21.40% ± 4 vs.13.20% ± 4.0, p < 0.0001], nodular glomerulosclerosis [7.40% ± 7, 0.75 vs. 2.40% ± 4.7, p = 0.02], and glomerulomegaly (18% vs. 10%, p = 0.010) than those on SD. Tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, inflammation, arteriolar hyalinosis, or fibrointimal thickening were mild and similar between groups. Triglyceride content in renal tissue was higher in animals on HFD than in SD (15.4% ± 0.5 vs. 12.7% ± 0.7; p < 0.01).Iberian pigs fed with fat-enriched food showed diabetoid changes and glomerulomegaly as observed in obese humans making this model suitable to study obesity-induced renal disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632110>Potential role of phytochemicals in  prevention and therapy.</a></h2><p> (MetS) is a set of cardiovascular risk factors which severely increases the risk of type II diabetes, renal disease and cardiovascular disease. Over the last decades, the role of dietary bioactive substances in features of MetS has been extensively investigated. Due to their multiple properties, these plant-derived natural compounds have demonstrated to provide positive effects in obesity, diabetes, renal and in cardiovascular disease. Catechins of green tea and caffeine reduce body mass index and waist circumference. Catechins, anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins of cocoa reduce blood pressure and blood glucose. Curcumin and silymarin exert hepatoprotective effects. Monacolins of red yeast rice are effective cholesterol-lowering agents. However, inconsistent or conflicting results have been found in clinical trials when other promising compounds in vitro or in animal studies, such as policosanol, curcumin or silymarin, were used. Low oral bioavailability of substances, ineffective dosages, inadequate treatment duration and insufficient statistical approach may explain the lack of effectiveness observed in some human studies. Further clinical studies are needed to better understand the role of bioactive compounds in the prevention and management of MetS.© 2019 Francini-Pesenti et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662928>A Rare Case of Cyclophosphamide-Induced Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy  in a Patient with Anti-GBM Vasculitis, and Review of Current Literature.</a></h2><p>Posterior reversible encephalopathy  (PRES) is a clinical  of headache, altered mental status, and seizures with reversible mainly posterior leukoencephalopathy on neuroimaging.

This study aimed to determine the effect of vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG)-induced weight loss on Lp(a) levels in obese individuals.Patients submitted to VSG from January 2011 to July 2015 were included. Anthropometric and  parameters were recorded before and 12 months after surgery. Univariate analysis identified associations between Lp(a) and anthropometry and  parameters, and the logistic regression predictors of Lp(a) decrease after VSG.MetS was present in 47% of the 330 patients involved. Patients with MetS had higher body mass index (BMI) and triglyceride levels and were more insulin-resistant. No differences were found between groups respecting Lp(a) levels prior to surgery (15.2 mg/dL vs. 15.0 mg/dL, p = 0.795). After surgery, patients without MetS had a decrease in Lp(a) levels (14.7 mg/dL vs. 12.3 mg/dL, p = 0.006), while MetS patients showed no differences (13.9 mg/dL vs. 14.6 mg/dL, p = 0.302). The regression model evidenced that older age and Δ HDL-c were predictors of Lp(a) decrease, whereas the greater the number of MetS components and lower estimated BF% loss, the lesser odds of decreasing Lp(a) after surgery.Despite a global improvement of conventional CVD risk factors, only individuals without MetS showed a decrease of Lp(a) levels after VSG. Further studies should explore not only the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the absence of decrease of Lp(a) levels in MetS patients, but also its impact on the  beneficial changes usually observed after VSG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638560>Review of SRD5A3 Disease-Causing Sequence Variants and Ocular Findings in Steroid 5α-Reductase Type 3 Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation, and a Detailed New Case.</a></h2><p>Steroid 5α-reductase type 3 congenital disorder of glycosylation (SRD5A3-CDG) is a severe  disease manifesting as muscle hypotonia, developmental delay, cerebellar ataxia and ocular symptoms; typically, nystagmus and optic disc pallor.

Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying microbiota engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and (2) patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from 5 individuals with  who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in microbiota induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

Our study's main aim was to explore the associations of HUA with other traditional risk factors in Romanian patients with DM and to assess the impact of the increase of serum UA on DM complications and HbA1c.In this cross-sectional, non-interventional study, we enrolled, according to a population-based, consecutive-case principle, 133 patients previously diagnosed with DM. HbA1c, uric acid, lipid profile, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, glomerular filtration rate, TSH and FT measurements were performed, while the diagnosis of retinopathy and of diabetic neuropathy was established using standardized methods.An increased uric acid level was associated with a significant increase in the risk for development of stroke (OR=1.526; p=0.004). A weak, positive and statistically significant correlation can also be observed between the BMI and the presence of hyperuricemia (r=0.131; p=0.034), and between the triglyceride levels and hyperuricemia (r= 0.173; p=0.004). Glomerular filtration rate was correlated to hyperuricemia in a strong and negative manner, having an important statistical significance (r=-0.818; p=0.003). In our study, UA levels and HbA1c were negatively correlated, without reaching statistical significance.Serum UA is strongly correlated with the BMI, triglyceride level and GFR in Romanian patients with DM and HUA is significantly associated with a higher risk of stroke in these individuals.© 2019 Gaita et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647997>TAZ encodes tafazzin, a transacylase essential for cardiolipin formation and central to the etiology of Barth .</a></h2><p>Tafazzin, which is encoded by the TAZ gene, catalyzes transacylation to form mature cardiolipin and shows preference for the transfer of a linoleic acid (LA) group from phosphatidylcholine (PC) to monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) with influence from mitochondrial membrane curvature.

Simple steatosis has been considered a benign condition, while the progression to fibrosis and advanced liver disease is related to NASH development. While steatosis is diagnosed by routine imaging methods, NASH could be diagnosed only by liver biopsy. Life style modification and weight reduction is the method of choice in the treatment of NAFLD. Despite intensive effort, no pharmacological treatment of NAFLD has been approved; based on the results of clinical trials the use of vitamin E or pioglitazone could be considered in the treatment of bioptically proved NASH. New antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory agents for the treatment of NASH are under evaluation.

Obesity occurs when dietary energy intake exceeds energy expenditure and has arisen in many societies due to an increasingly "obesogenic" environment in which physical activity has declined and yet children continue to be exposed to unhealthy, energy-dense diets. Additional risks for the development of obesity also include psychological issues and genetic factors. Obesity has many adverse health consequences including development of insulin resistance, Type 2 diabetes, and the . There are also important genetic influences on the likelihood of developing insulin resistance.

These are likely to be most successful when targeting the young and will require a combination of approaches which will need inter-disciplinary collaborations across health and local government to target families, schools, and local environments to facilitate behavior changes which influence young people's eating behaviors and habitual levels of physical activity.Copyright © 2019 Gregory.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635427>Dietary Patterns May Be Nonproportional Hazards for the Incidence of Type 2 Diabetes: Evidence from Korean Adult Females.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to examine the association between the incidence of type 2 diabetes and various risk factors including dietary patterns based on the rigorous proportional hazards assumption tests. Data for 3335 female subjects aged 40-69 years from the Korea Genome and Epidemiology Study were used. The assumption of proportional hazards was tested using the scaled Schoenfeld test. The stratified Cox regression was used to adjust the nonproportionality of diabetic risk factors, and the regression was adjusted for potential confounding variables, such as age, marital status, physical activity, drinking, smoking, BMI, etc.  and meat and fish pattern variables were positively associated with diabetes. However, dietary patterns and  variables violated the proportional hazards assumption; therefore, the stratified Cox regression with the interaction terms was applied to adjust the nonproportionality and to allow the possible different parameters over each stratum. The highest quartile of meat and fish pattern was associated with diabetes only in subjects aged over 60 years. Moreover, subjects who were obese and had  had higher risk in bread and snacks (HR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.00-3.40) and meat and fish pattern (HR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.01-3.26), respectively.

Inconsistent diagnostic criteria, variable provider knowledge, and lack of consensus pose specific challenges for the care of women with PCOS. These factors encourage inaccurate diagnosis with both under and overdiagnosis. This unfavorable diagnostic experience exasperates affected women and limits timely opportunities for intervention to minimize associated comorbidities, especially during the transition from pediatric to adult care. Recognition of these issues in the care of adolescents and women with PCOS inspired the development of the International Evidence-Based PCOS Guidelines, which emphasize the prevention, screening, and treatment of PCOS across the reproductive lifespan. The Guidelines and accompanying meta-analyses focus on three major categories of associated comorbidities: (1) reproductive; (2) ; and (3) psychological. With the exception of infertility, this article considers common manifestations and comorbidities associated with PCOS throughout the lifecycle. Healthy lifestyle interventions with prevention of excess weight gain comprise the primary intervention for all comorbidities. Hence, early identification of girls "at risk" for PCOS and those with PCOS is a priority.

Here we report the identification of Cardiac Glycosides (CGs) as a family of compounds with senolytic activity. CGs, by targeting the Na+/K+ATPase pump, cause a disbalanced electrochemical gradient within the cell causing depolarization and acidification. Senescent cells present a slightly depolarized plasma membrane and higher concentrations of H+, making them more susceptible to the action of CGs. These vulnerabilities can be exploited for therapeutic purposes as evidenced by the in vivo eradication of tumors xenografted in mice after treatment with the combination of a senogenic and a senolytic drug. The senolytic effect of CGs is also effective in the elimination of senescence-induced lung fibrosis.

This study was aimed at investigating predictors and correlates of MBPS in diabetes. In a cross-sectional study including 167 patients with diabetes (age 58.5 ± 11.1 years, duration 15.9 ± 12.1 years), clinical variables, diabetic and neuropathic complications, and MBPS (using 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) were measured. The upper quartile of MBPS (>30.5 mmHg) was associated with higher values of waist circumference (P = 0.027), triglycerides (P = 0.021), and Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score (P = 0.042), with lower HDL cholesterol (P = 0.030), and with the presence of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) (P = 0.016) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) (P < 0.0001). In a logistic regression analysis, PVD (odds ratio: 10.2, P = 0.001), CAN (odds ratio: 6.09, P = 0.016), and diastolic blood pressure (BP) (odds ratio: 1.06, P = 0.022) predicted MBPS upper quartile (r = 0.20, P = 0.0005). In a multiple regression analysis, PVD (P = 0.002) and diastolic BP (P = 0.003) were the only determinants of MBPS (r = 0.20). MBPS upper quartile was associated with BP dipping (systolic BP day-night reduction > 10%) (P = 0.012), and MBPS was positively related to systolic (rho = 0.41, P < 0.0001) and diastolic BP day-night reduction. In conclusion,  stigmata, diastolic BP, CAN and PVD are the main predictors of MBPS in the diabetic population. Excessive MBPS and nondipping are not concurrent 24-h BP alterations.

However, little is known either about developmental programming in subjects of normal birthweight, or about events between the ages which separate early programming and the occurrence of disease at late adulthood. We tested the hypothesis that circulating concentrations of leptin, adiponectin and insulin in young, healthy adults, born with a birth size within the normal range, are influenced by early life growth patterns. In an observational study of 188 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 25 years (97 males, 91 females) we investigated the association of  function with their birth size, their growth during childhood and their body composition. High plasma leptin in early adulthood, a risk factor for cardio-, was associated with low weight at age two years (correlation coefficient controlled for adult weight = -0.21, p<0.01). It was also positively associated with pre-prandial insulin and with HOMA (Homeostasis Model Assessment) insulin resistance. Leptin, leptin-adiponectin ratio and insulin correlated with lean mass, fat mass and percent fat (p<0.0001). In conclusion, high leptin in early adulthood was associated with both low weight at age two years and insulin resistance. We speculate that high leptin is developmentally programmed and can contribute to the association between low weight in early infancy and increased cardio- risk in adulthood in heathy subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636271>A comprehensive study of metabolite genetics reveals strong pleiotropy and heterogeneity across time and context.</a></h2><p>Genetic studies of metabolites have identified thousands of variants, many of which are associated with downstream  and obesogenic disorders.

The early identification of high-risk individuals is the key for halting these conditions. The world is facing a growing epidemic MetS although the magnitude in Egypt is unknown.  To describe MetS and its determinants among apparently healthy individuals residing in urban and rural communities in Egypt and to establish a model for MetS prediction.  A cross-sectional study was conducted with 270 adults from rural and urban districts in Alexandria, Egypt. Participants were clinically evaluated and interviewed for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and dietary habits. MetS was defined according to the harmonized criteria set by the AHA/NHLBI. The risk of ischemic heart diseases (IHDs), DM and fatty liver were assessed using validated risk prediction charts. A multiple risk model for predicting MetS was developed, and its performance was compared.  In total, 57.8% of the study population met the criteria for MetS and were at high risk for developing IHD, DM, and fatty liver. Silent CVD risk factors were identified in 20.4% of the participants. In our proposed multivariate logistic regression model, the predictors of MetS were obesity [OR (95% CI) = 16.3 (6.03-44.0)], morbid obesity [OR (95% CI) = 21.7 (5.3-88.0)], not working [OR (95% CI) = 2.05 (1.1-3.8)], and having a family history of chronic diseases [OR (95% CI) = 4.38 (2.23-8.61)]. Consumption of caffeine once per week protected against MetS by 27.8-fold. The derived prediction rule was accurate in predicting MetS, fatty liver, high risk of DM, and, to a lesser extent, a 10-year lifetime risk of IHD.  Central obesity and sedentary lifestyles are accountable for the rising rates of MetS in our society. Interventions are needed to minimize the potential predisposition of the Egyptian population to cardiometabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627977>Identification of a rare presenilin 1 single amino acid deletion mutation (F175del) with unusual amyloid-β processing effects.</a></h2><p>We report the novel presenilin 1 (PSEN1) single amino acid deletion mutation F175del. Comprehensive clinical work-up, including cerebral MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF analysis, was performed in a male who had developed forgetfulness at the age of 39. Alzheimer's disease dementia was diagnosed according to established criteria. The index patient manifested rapid progressive dementia, seizures, and myoclonus, and a Pisa  as a side effect of donepezil treatment. The PSEN1 mutation F175del was found on genetic testing. It was rendered very likely pathogenic as amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide 42 was elevated in a cell culture model compared to presenilin 1 wild-type controls. An additional, unusual increase in Aβ39 indicates a rarely observed product line deviation in the generation of the shorter Aβ species. Our observations extend the range of PSEN1 mutations to be considered in familial dementia. We demonstrate that deletion of a single conserved amino acid, which is very rare compared to missense mutations as the common cause for PSEN1-associated Alzheimer's disease, can lead to an unusual profile of Aβ species.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We sought to investigate the relationship between THY imaging detection/size and clinically relevant aging outcomes such as  (MetS), multimorbidity (MM), and frailty in PWH.This was a cross-sectional observational study including 665 HIV patients (81% males; median age, 53 years) attending Modena HIV  Clinic from 2014 to 2017. They underwent thoracic computed tomography scan as part of the medical assessment for cardiovascular disease, in which THY detection and size were reported using a semiquantitative score. Outcome measures were MetS, MM, and frailty.THY was detected in 27.0% of subjects; 71.1% showed THY size of grade 1-2, and 28.9% exhibited grade ≥3. Covariates that inversely correlated with THY detection were age, male gender, body mass index (BMI), and HIV duration. Covariates that inversely correlated with MetS were age, HIV duration, BMI, and THY grade 1-2. Covariates that inversely correlated with MM were age, HIV duration, and CD4 nadir. Covariates that inversely correlated with frailty were age, HIV duration, CD4 nadir, BMI, and THY detection.THY is inversely associated with MetS and frailty in PWH.© The Author(s) 2019.

Although surgical and non-surgical methods for reducing SAT exist, patients remain non-compliant because of potential adverse effects and cost. In this study, we developed a new minimally-invasive approach to achieve SAT reduction, using a microneedle (MN) patch prepared from gelatin, which is capable of regulating fat metabolism. Four gelatin types were used: three derived from fish (SA-FG, GT-FG 220, and GT-FG 250), and one from swine (SM-PG 280). We applied gelatin-based MN patches five times over 4 weeks to rats with high-fat diet (HD)-induced obesity, and determined the resulting amount of SAT. We also investigated the histological features and determined the expression levels of fat metabolism-associated genes in SAT using hematoxylin and eosin staining and western blotting, respectively. SAT decreased following treatment with all four gelatin MN patches. Smaller adipocytes were observed in the regions treated with SA-FG, GT-FG 250, and SM-PG 280 MNs, demonstrating a decline in fat accumulation. The expression levels of fat metabolism-associated genes in the MN-treated SAT revealed that GT-FG 220 regulates fatty acid synthase (FASN) protein levels. These findings suggest that gelatin MN patches aid in decreasing the quantity of unwanted SAT by altering lipid metabolism and fat deposition.Copyright © 2019 The Korean Society Of Toxicology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657510>The Buckwheat Iminosugar d-Fagomine Attenuates Sucrose-Induced Steatosis and Hypertension in Rats.</a></h2><p>This study examines the long-term functional effects of d-fagomine on sucrose- induced factors of  dysfunctions and explores possible molecular mechanisms behind its action.Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were fed a 35% sucrose solution with d-fagomine (or not, for comparison) or mineral water (controls) for 24 weeks.

Although obesity is usually defined as elevated body mass index (BMI), recent data indicate a superior role of waist circumference or hypertriglyceridemic waist (HTGW) over BMI in the assessment of cardiometabolic risk. In dyslipidemic patients, the specific contributions of risky waist, HTGW or BMI have not been evaluated as yet. 686 dyslipidemic subjects (322 males and 364 females) were enrolled into a cross-sectional study. In each subject basic antropometry (i.e. waist circumference, HTGW, BMI) and laboratory parameters of lipid profile and insulin resistance were determined. Cardiometabolic risk was given by fulfilling the criteria (harmonized definition) of . The significance of risky waist, HTGW and BMI were assessed by comparing the respective predictive values for the presence of . Dyslipidemic patients with risky waist, HTGW or high BMI have a more atherogenic lipid profile and higher insulin resistance compared to those without risky waist, HTGW or high BMI. Risky waist is stronger predictor of  (PPV 66 %, NPV 90 %) and thus poses a greater cardiometabolic risk than higher BMI per se does (PPV 42 %, NPV 97 %). The contribution of triglycerides (i.e. HTGW) to these predictive values is marginal (PPV 66 %, NPV 92 %). The present results highlight the superior role of waist circumference as a screening tool over BMI for the evaluation of cardiometabolic risk in dyslipidemic subjects. HTGW brings little additional benefit in risk stratification.

The drug scheme administration consisted of a starting dose of STP of 10-15 mg/kg/d with increments every week, up to a maximum of 50 mg/kg/d, based on both age and weight. Etiology of epilepsy was codified as structural, genetic, infectious, immune, , and unknown. Responders were defined as patients who achieved a seizure frequency reduction of ≥50%. Retention rate was defined as the probability of continuing STP without additional therapy. Tolerability was assessed by reporting adverse events.A total of 132 individuals aged from 5 months to 43 years received add-on STP, including 30 patients with Dravet  (DS).

Owing to paucity of studies focused on peripheral IR in relation to pathological outcome, we aim to investigate homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) by histological characteristics of NAFLD.Liver biopsy of 588 patients was screened. After excluding etiologies other than NAFLD and factors contributing to IR, serum HOMA-IR was compared with patients' histologic features. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess their relationship. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) was calculated to assess the discriminatory ability of homeostatic model assessment of IR for advanced lobular inflammation (LI).We observed higher serum level of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and low-density lipoprotein as HOMA-IR increased. HOMA-IR is significantly associated with severity of LI (odds ratio = 1.222, 95% confidence interval = 1.135-1.315, P < 0.001), similar association remained after adjusting for age, BMI, hemoglobin A1c, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides (odds ratio = 1.205, 95% confidence interval = 1.102-1.317, P < 0.001). HOMA-IR is discriminant of LI with AUROC = 0.832 and cutoff = 2.995 (sensitivity = 0.938, specificity = 0.569).This study demonstrated a strong and independent association of HOMA-IR with the severity of liver inflammation by histological evaluation in NAFLD patients without diabetes or , and its possible role in diagnosis of LI could be translated into clinical assessment of NAFLD patients with uncertainty of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646583>Key molecular pathways in the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common chronic liver disease worldwide and also become an emerging risk factor for liver-related complications, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The liver-related burden of NASH is likely to increase and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is probably to be the leading indication for liver transplantation by 2020, as a consequence of increased disease prevalence and of the lack of an effective treatment. The first step in the NAFLD development is represented by fat accumulation in the liver, a condition that is commonly associated with features of the . Notably, it has been acknowledged that the step from nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to NASH is key step in the NASH formation, and the mechanisms behind this transition have been extensively studied. Emerging evidence indicates that innate immunity is a driving force in NAFLD progression because it directly regulates all key pathogenic features of the disease processes, including  dysregulation, inflammation, and fibrosis. In this review, we summarize the currently available signaling pathways of NASH formation, including oxidative stress, NOD-like receptors (NLRs), mitochondria-associated pathways, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nuclear receptors, and other signal pathways, for the aim of a better understanding of this disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642256>[Quantitative endogenous peptidomics analysis of the type-2 diabetic clinical serum samples].</a></h2><p>Diabetes is a systemic  disorder , mainly characterized by hyperglycemia, and is associated with the dysfunction of various organs, such as liver, pancreas, intestine, adipose muscle tissue, kidney and brain.

However, whether this association is causal is still unclear. We aimed to test whether genetically lowered vitamin D levels were associated with MS and its  traits, using mendelian randomization (MR) methodology.Ten thousand six hundred fifty-five participants were enrolled from the SPECT-China study, which was performed in 23 sites in East China during 2014 to 2016. Using four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DHCR7, CYP2R1, GC and CYP24A1 genes with known effects on 25(OH) D concentrations, we created a genetic risk score (GRS) as instrumental variable (IV) to estimate the effect of genetically lowered 25(OH) D on MS and cardiometabolic risk factors. MS was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria.Lower measured 25(OH)D levels were associated with MS (OR 0.921, 95% CI 0.888, 0.954) after multivariable adjustment. However, the MR-derived odds ratio of genetically determined 25(OH) D for risk of MS was 0.977 (95% CI 0.966, 1.030). The MR-derived estimates for raised fasting plasma glucose was 0.578 (95% CI 0.321, 0.980) per 10 nmol/L GRS determined increase of 25(OH) D levels.We found no evidence that genetically determined reduction in 25(OH)D conferred an increased risk of MS and its  traits. However, we created our GRS only on the basis of common variants, which represent limited amount of variance in 25(OH)D. MR studies using rare variants, and large-scale well-designed RCTs about the effect of vitamin D supplementation on MS are warranted to further validate the findings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634505>Synthetic small molecule analogues of the immunomodulatory Acanthocheilonema viteae product ES-62 promote  homeostasis during obesity in a mouse model.</a></h2><p>One of the most rapidly increasing human public health problems is obesity, whose sequelae like type-2 diabetes, represent continuously worsening, life-long conditions. Over the last 15 years, data have begun to emerge from human and more frequently, mouse studies, that support the idea that parasitic worm infection can protect against this condition. We have therefore investigated the potential of two synthetic small molecule analogues (SMAs) of the anti-inflammatory Acanthocheilonema viteae product ES-62, to protect against  dysfunction in a C57BL/6 J mouse model of high calorie-induced obesity. We found weekly subcutaneous administration of the SMAs in combination (1 μg of each), starting one week before continuous exposure to high calorie diet (HCD), decreased fasting glucose levels and reversed the impaired glucose clearance observed in male mice, when measured at approximately 7 and 13 weeks after exposure to HCD. Fasting glucose levels were also improved in male mice fed a HCD for some 38 weeks when given SMA-treatment 13 weeks after the start of HCD, indicating an SMA-therapeutic potential. For the most part, protective effects were not observed in female mice. SMA treatment also conferred protection against each of reduced ileum villus length and liver fibrosis, but more prominently in female mice. Previous studies in mice indicate that protection against  dysfunction is usually associated with polarisation of the immune system towards a type-2/anti-inflammatory direction but our attempts to correlate improved  parameters with such changes were unsuccessful. Further analysis will therefore be required to define mechanism of action. Nevertheless, overall our data clearly show the potential of the drug-like SMAs as a preventative or treatment for  dysregulation associated with obesity.Copyright © 2019.

Results showed that MetS defined by the revised National Cholesterol Education Program's Adults Treatment Panel III criteria was not associated with a significantly affected GC risk (adjusted risk ratio [RR]: 1.03, p = 0.59; I = 79%). Subgroup analyses showed that MetS was not associated with a significantly affected risk of GC in male or female patients, and in Asians or Caucasians.

The source of excessively high levels of GCs allows the identification of endogenous and exogenous (iatrogenic) CS. Iatrogenic patients usually receive also anti-metabolites serving as the foundation to modern steroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy. Tissues mainly targeted by CS are bone and fat, both derived from progenitor cells named mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In addition, the pathogenic role of MSCs in other diseases sharing common properties with CS, such as an altered inflammatory profile and increased oxidative stress, has been identified. In this light, MSCs isolated from skin of control healthy subjects (C-MSCs), patients affected by endogenous CS (ENDO-MSCs), patients affected by iatrogenic CS (IATRO-MSCs) and patients affected by exogenous CS receiving steroid-sparing drugs (SS-MSCs), respectively, have been isolated and analyzed. ENDO- and IATRO-MSCs showed a reduced differentiative potential toward osteogenic and adipogenic lineages compared to C-MSCs, whereas SS-MSCs re-acquired the ability to differentiate, with a trend similar to control cells. In addition, MSCs from CS groups, compared to control MSCs, displayed a reduction in the secretion of cytokines (immune-suppression), a decreased expression of genes related to wound healing and a dysregulation of the enzymes/genes related to antioxidant capacity. In conclusion, our results suggest that the hallmarks of CS, such as wound healing impairment and immunosuppression, are already detectable in undifferentiated cells, which could be considered a potential therapeutic early target for control of CS.Copyright © 2019 Caffarini, Armeni, Pellegrino, Cianfruglia, Martino, Offidani, Di Benedetto, Arnaldi, Campanati and Orciani.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652121>Advances in the management of craniopharyngioma in children and adults.</a></h2><p>Background Childhood and adult-onset craniopharyngioma is a rare embryogenic tumor of the sellar, suprasellar, and parasellar region.

In women with PCOS the prevalence of type II diabetes and  was not significantly increased and lipid levels were not different from controls. cIMT was lower in women with PCOS (P<0.001). Calculated cardiovascular health and 10-year CVD risk were similar in women with PCOS and controls.Middle-aged women with PCOS exhibit only a moderately unfavorable cardiometabolic profile compared to age-matched controls, even though they present with an increased BMI and waist circumference. Furthermore, we found no evidence for increased (10-year) CVD risk or more severe atherosclerosis compared to controls from the general population. Long term follow-up of women with PCOS is necessary to provide a definitive answer concerning long term risk for CVD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649313>Improving obesity and blood pressure.</a></h2><p>Obesity-associated hypertension is a serious public health concern. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity, especially in the kidneys, is an important mechanism linking obesity to hypertension. Some adipokines play important roles in elevating blood pressure (BP). Hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance stimulates sodium reabsorption, enhances sodium retention, and increases circulating plasma volume. Hyperinsulinemia also stimulates both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the SNS, resulting in the acceleration of atherosclerosis through the hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells, which contributes to increased peripheral vascular resistance. Obesity is associated with increased RAAS activity despite volume overload, as the tissue RAASs are stimulated in obese hypertensive individuals. Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated hypertension must also be considered in obese patients with resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea  (OSAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Some components of the gut microbiota contribute to BP control; therefore, gut dysbiosis caused by obesity might lead to increased BP. The ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat is higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, which may explain why Japanese patients are more susceptible to  disorders even though they are less obese than Caucasian individuals. Obesity-associated kidney dysfunction directly increases BP, leading to further deterioration of kidney function. A bodyweight reduction of more than 3% or 5 kg significantly lowers BP. Gastrointestinal bypass surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and its related  disorders, including hypertension. Because both obesity and hypertension are representative lifestyle-related disorders, lifestyle modification, especially to improve obesity, should be performed first as a treatment for hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653834>DNA damage and transcription stress cause ATP-mediated redesign of metabolism and potentiation of anti-oxidant buffering.</a></h2><p>Accumulation of DNA lesions causing transcription stress is associated with natural and accelerated aging and culminates with profound  alterations. Our understanding of the mechanisms governing  redesign upon genomic instability, however, is highly rudimentary. Using Ercc1-defective mice and Xpg knock-out mice, we demonstrate that combined defects in transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) and in nucleotide excision repair (NER) directly affect bioenergetics due to declined transcription, leading to increased ATP levels. This in turn inhibits glycolysis allosterically and favors glucose rerouting through the pentose phosphate shunt, eventually enhancing production of NADPH-reducing equivalents. In NER/TCR-defective mutants, augmented NADPH is not counterbalanced by increased production of pro-oxidants and thus pentose phosphate potentiation culminates in an over-reduced redox state. Skin fibroblasts from the TCR disease Cockayne  confirm results in animal models. Overall, these findings unravel a mechanism connecting DNA damage and transcriptional stress to  redesign and protective antioxidant defenses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655510>Initial Regional Evaluation of Cystic Fibrosis Newborn Screening Program: Data from Mediterranean Coast of Turkey.</a></h2><p>Background/ aim: Since January 2015, Cystic Fibrosis Newborn Screening (CFNS) program has been implemented in Turkey. We aimed to evaluate the demographic, clinical and laboratory data of cases referred from the CFNS program, and to determine the most suitable cut-off value for immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT)-1 and immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT-2) that are used in CFNS program in Turkey.A total of 156 Turkish-Caucasian subjects were determined as positive cases during 3 years, January 2015-January 2018, and were referred to the Pediatric Pulmonology clinics of Akdeniz University Hospital, Antalya, Turkey, national CFNS program. The evaluation was made considering the IRT-1, IRT-2 values, demographic characteristics, sweat test results, CFTR genotypes, and diagnoses.Nine cases were diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Eight cases were diagnosed with CF-related  syndromes and three cases were determined as CF carriers. The ratio of CF to CF-related  was determined as 1.1:1. Considering the limits of the present CFNS program and IRT method, the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) for the referred cases was determined as 5.8%. When a cut-off value of 105.6 ng/ml was taken for IRT-1, sensitivity was 100%, specificity was 59% and PPV was 12.8%. For a cutoff value of 88.75 ng/ml for IRT-2, sensitivity was determined as 90%, specificity as 65% and PPV as 15.2%.This is the first detailed clinical study that has evaluated the data from the CFNS program in the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. As false positive results are extremely high in Turkey, there is an urgent need for revision of IRT-1 and IRT-2 limits by evaluating the data of the whole country.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656024>Potential clinical variants detected in mitochondrial DNA D-loop hypervariable region I of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a mitochondrial disease. However, the underlying role of mitochondrial genetics has not yet been completely elucidated. Evaluation of D-loop nucleotide variations with respect to statistical significance and clinical data distribution.Genomic DNAs were extracted from the peripheral blood samples of patients with biopsy-proven 150 NASH as well as from 150 healthy individuals to explore the functional D-loop region responsible for the replication and transcription of the mitochondrial genome. DNA sequencing by capillary electrophoresis analysis was performed for the D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA containing the hypervariable region I, and restriction fragment length polymorphism with MnlI analysis was performed for the m.16189 T/C D-loop variant.The m.A16318C variant was detected only in patients with NASH and approached significance level. Based on clinical data, six variants associated with histological subgroups of NASH and NASH-complicated diseases were identified. In patients with NASH, the m.16129 AA genotype was associated with advanced-stage fibrosis; the m.16249 CC genotype was associated with advanced lobular inflammation and advanced-stage histological steatosis; the m.16296 TT genotype was associated with hypothyroidism; the m.16163 GG and m.16294 TT genotypes were associated with ; and the m.16256 TT+CT genotypes were associated with type II diabetes. In patients with NASH, microRNAs were estimated by targeting the significant variants identified in this study.These findings suggest that NASH may be associated with D-loop nucleotide variations and that microRNA-based in vitro and/or in vivo studies may be developed by targeting the D-loop variants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639178>Sleep problems are a strong predictor of stress-related  changes in police officers. A prospective study.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown that workers chronically exposed to occupational stress have an increased risk of  (MetS) and sleep problems (SPs). The purpose of this study was to verify whether SPs mediate the relationship between stress and MetS.A 5-year prospective cohort study included 242 police officers from a rapid response unit engaged exclusively in maintaining law and order. Perceived stress levels were measured repeatedly with the demand-control-support and the effort-reward-imbalance questionnaires; insomnia symptoms were assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; excessive daytime sleepiness was measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. MetS and its components were evaluated at baseline and at follow-up.During 5-year follow-up period, 26 new cases of MetS were identified. Both occupational stress and SPs were significantly related to incident cases of MetS. Insomnia symptoms showed a highly significant association with MetS (aOR 11.038; CI95% 2.867-42.493). Mediation analysis confirmed that SPs mediate the relationship between stress and MetS. A reciprocal relationship was found between job stress and SPs. Work-related stress was a significant predictor of insomnia symptoms, short sleep duration, sleep dissatisfaction, and sleepiness. Compared to the reference group, police officers with SPs at baseline had significantly higher odds of reporting high stress at follow-up.SPs play a mediating role in the relationship between occupational stress and MetS. Prevention of MetS must include the control of stress factors and an increase in the resilience of workers, but correct sleep hygiene is also an essential factor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664519>Dietary intervention using (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a fungus-derived soluble prebiotic ameliorates high-fat diet-induced  distress and alters beneficially the gut microbiota in mice model.</a></h2><p>Western diet, rich in carbohydrates and fat, is said to be a major factor underlying . Interventions with prebiotics, the key modulators of the gut microbiota, have paramount impact on host-associated  disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of fungus-derived (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a highly soluble dietary fiber, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced  distress.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with different diet groups (n = 11): control diet, HFD, 3 g/kg or 5 g/kg of β-glucan-incorporated HFD. At the end of experimental study period (12th week), body weight, feces weight and fecal moisture content were observed. Further, colonic motility was measured using activated charcoal meal study. Proteins extracted from liver and intestine tissues were subjected to western blot technique. Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal microbiota analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti-obesity property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness). Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly obesity-associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced  distress.

Both DM and hypertension are major risk factors, for end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular events and mortality. Strict blood pressure (BP) control in diabetics has been associated with a cardiovascular and renal risk decrease. Inhibitors of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) in the proximal tubule is a relatively novel class of agents for treatment of type 2 DM. Inhibition of SGLT-2 co-transporter combines proximal tubule diuretic and osmotic diuretic action leading to glucose reabsorption reduction and mild natriuretic and diuretic effects. On this basis, several studies showed that treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors can effectively decrease hyperglycemia but also increase BP control and reduce renal outcomes and cardiovascular mortality. Based on such evidence, the recent guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes now suggest that SGLT-2 inhibitors should be preferred among oral agents in combination with metformin, in patients at increased cardiovascular risk, chronic kidney disease or heart failure. This review summarizes the existing data from studies evaluating the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on BP, and its potential value for cardio and nephroprotection.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653028>Noninvasive and Convenient Screening of  Using the Controlled Attenuation Parameter Technology: An Evaluation Based on Self-Paid Health Examination Participants.</a></h2><p>There is a medical need for an easy, fast, and non-invasive method for  (MetS) screening. This study aimed to assess the ability of FibroScan to detect MetS, in participants who underwent a self-paid health examination.A retrospective cohort study was conducted on all adults who underwent a self-paid health examination comprising of an abdominal transient elastography inspection using FibroScan 502 Touch from March 2015 to February 2019. FibroScan can assess the level of liver fibrosis by using a liver stiffness score, and the level of liver steatosis by using the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) score. The logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve were applied to select significant predictors and assess their predictability. A final model that included all significant predictors that are found by univariate analysis, and a convenient model that excluded all invasive parameters were created.Of 1983 participants, 13.6% had a physical status that fulfilled MetS criteria. The results showed that the CAP score solely could achieve an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79 (0.76-0.82) in predicting MetS, and the AUC can be improved to 0.88 (0.85-0.90) in the final model. An AUC of 0.85 (0.83-0.88) in predicting MetS was obtained in the convenient model, which includes only 4 parameters (CAP score, gender, age, and BMI). A panel of predictability indices (the ranges of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio: 0.78-0.89, 0.66-0.82, 2.64-4.47, and 0.17-0.26) concerning gender- and BMI-specific CAP cut-off values (range: 191.65-564.95) were presented for practical reference.Two prediction systems were proposed for identifying individuals with a physical status that fulfilled the MetS criteria, and a panel of predictability indices was presented for practical reference. Both systems had moderate predictive performance. The findings suggested that FibroScan evaluation is appropriate as a first-line MetS screening; however, the variation in prediction performance of such systems among groups with varying  derangements warrants further studies in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633721>EVALUATION OF PROGRESSION OF HEPATIC FIBROSIS IN A GROUP OF PATIENTS WITH NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE ACCOMPANIED FOR 10 YEARS.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has been progressively diagnosed in the general population as a consequence of the increased prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, its main risk factors. It is characterized by accumulation of fat in the hepatocytes associated with lobular inflammation and balonization, which can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. Thus, a characterization and follow-up of a progression of the fibrosis level of these patients becomes important, being that the transient hepatic elastography is a reliable method for this evaluation with a measure of the kapa index.To evaluate the progression of hepatic fibrosis through elastography in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Patients who had previously performed hepatic biopsy and noninvasive scores for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis were included in the study. These same subjects were then submitted to current clinical evaluation, laboratory and liver elastography tests, defining the level of liver fibrosis, about 10 years after the first evaluation.Data were analyzed for 66 patients previously submitted to liver biopsy. Of these, 16 were not found, four could not participate because they were debilitated due to hepatic cirrhosis, two had died from an automobile accident and five from complications of cirrhosis of the liver. Therefore, of the 50 patients with a known history, 9 (18%) had died of cirrhosis or were unable to attend the examination because of their liver disease. The remaining population was predominantly female (61.5%), mean age of 63 years, being overweight, dyslipidemia (76.9%), disorders of the glycemic profile (76.9%), and  (82.1%). Of the 39 cases evaluated, 35% had the same degree of fibrosis at the initial evaluation (biopsy) and at the current evaluation (elastography), 33% had an increase in the degree of fibrosis and another 30% had a decrease in the degree of fibrosis. Twenty-eight patients had NASH at baseline. Regarding these patients, it was observed in the current evaluation, that 25% remained stable in the degree of fibrosis, 39% progressed, and 35% regressed.Despite some limitations of our study, such as the small number of patients, and the use of two different methods of evaluation (biopsy and elastography), the data obtained allow us to conclude that of the 39 evaluated cases, 33% (13) presented progression of fibrosis and the total group of 50 patients, 42% had cirrhosis or died due to liver disease. The presence of NASH on hepatic biopsy did not prove to be, in our study, a predictive of the evolution of hepatic fibrosis in the patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652917> Cytokines at Fasting and During Macronutrient Challenges: Influence of Obesity, Female Androgen Excess and Sex.</a></h2><p>Cytokines have pleiotropic functions within the organism and their levels may be influenced by obesity, visceral adiposity and sex hormones. Diet composition may also affect their systemic concentrations during fasting and in the postprandial period. Hence, we studied the influence of sex steroids and obesity on the circulating levels of a panel of  cytokines in the fasting state and after single macronutrient challenges.On alternate days we submitted 17 women with polycystic ovary  (PCOS) (9 non-obese, 8 obese), 17 non-hyperandrogenic control women (9 non-obese, 8 obese) and 19 control men (10 non-obese, 9 obese) to isocaloric oral glucose, lipid and protein loads. Serum levels of omentin-1, vaspin, lipocalin-2, adipsin, PAI-1, chemerin, FGF-21 and FGF-23 were determined by Luminex multiplex technology.During fasting, obese patients presented higher levels of PAI-1, chemerin and adipsin but decreased FGF-23 and omentin-1 compared with non-obese subjects. Vaspin showed sexual dimorphism with lower levels in men than women with PCOS and female controls. Following macronutrient ingestion, most  cytokines presented a similar physiological response consisting of a decrease in circulating concentrations, which was inversely associated with the fasting levels of these molecules. Protein intake caused the major postprandial decrease whereas glucose did not significantly reduce PAI-1, FGF-23 and vaspin, and even increased FGF-21. Regardless of the macronutrient administered, vaspin levels showed a larger reduction in non-obese individuals while the decrease in PAI-1 was particularly noticeable in the obese subgroup. The postprandial reductions of omentin-1 and FGF-23 after glucose and protein loads were influenced by obesity. No major differences were found between patients with PCOS and male and female controls.Obesity, but not PCOS or sex, markedly influences  cytokine levels at fasting and after macronutrient ingestion. The observed postprandial decrease in their circulating concentrations might represent a physiological compensatory mechanism against food-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. This mechanism is altered by obesity and is differently modulated by macronutrients, suggesting a larger contribution of glucose to stressful postprandial responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635032>Plasma Metabolomics Identifies Lipid and Amino Acid Markers of Weight Loss in Patients with Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Cachexia is a multifactorial wasting  associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. Diagnosis can be difficult and, in the clinical situation, usually relies upon reported weight loss. The 'omics' technologies allow us the opportunity to study the end points of many biological processes. Among these, blood-based metabolomics is a promising method to investigate the pathophysiology of human cancer cachexia and identify candidate biomarkers. In this study, we performed liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based metabolomics to investigate the  profile of cancer-associated weight loss. Non-selected patients undergoing surgery with curative intent for upper gastrointestinal cancer were recruited. Fasting plasma samples were taken at induction of anaesthesia. LC/MS analysis showed that 6 metabolites were highly discriminative of weight loss. Specifically, a combination profile of LysoPC 18.2, L-Proline, Hexadecanoic acid, Octadecanoic acid, Phenylalanine and LysoPC 16:1 showed close correlation for eight weight-losing samples (≥5% weight loss) and nine weight-stable samples (<5%weight loss) between predicted and actual weight change (r = 0.976,  = 0.0014). Overall, 40 metabolites were associated with ≥5% weight loss. This study provides biological validation of the consensus definition of cancer cachexia (Fearon et al.) and provides feasible candidate markers for further investigation in early diagnosis and the assessment of therapeutic intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658221>Perfluoroalkyl Substances and  in Firefighters: A pilot study.</a></h2><p>to compare association of Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) with  (MetS) profile among firefighters (FF) at airport to suburban FF METHODS:: cross sectional exploratory study, 47 male FF aged 18-62 years were enrolled from two fire departments in Ohio.

This study aimed to investigate the potential role of 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning for the quantitative assessment of SSc-related active ILD.18F-FDG PET/CT scans and high resolution CT scans of eight SSc patients, including five with ILD, were analysed. For comparison, reference groups were included: eight SLE patients and four primary Sjögren's  (pSS) patients, all without ILD. A total of 22 regions of interest were drawn in each patient at apical, medial and dorsobasal lung levels. 18F-FDG uptake was measured as mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) in each region of interest. Subsequently, basal/apical (B/A) and medial/apical (M/A) ratios were calculated at patient level (B/A-p and M/A-p) and at tissue level (B/A-t and M/A-t).SUVmean values in dorsobasal ROIs and B/A-p ratios were increased in SSc with ILD compared with SSc without ILD (P = 0.04 and P = 0.07, respectively), SLE (P = 0.003 and P = 0.002, respectively) and pSS (P = 0.03 and P = 0.02, respectively). Increased uptake in the dorsobasal lungs and increased B/A-t ratios corresponded to both ground glass and reticulation on high resolution CT.Semi-quantitative assessment of 18F-FDG PET/CT is able to distinguish ILD from non-affected lung tissue in SSc, suggesting that it may be used as a new biomarker for SSc-ILD disease activity.© The Author(s) 2019.

We aimed to evaluate the utilization and outcome of severely obese patients with MetS who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG)  laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Using the 2015 and 2016  and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program database, data were obtained for patients with MetS undergoing LSG or LRYGB. There were 29,588 MetS patients (LSG: 58.7%  LRYGB: 41.3%). There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality (0.1% for LSG  0.2% for LRYGB, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.58, confidence interval (CI) 0.32-1.05,  = 0.07) or length of stay between groups (2 ± 2 for LSG  2.2 ± 2 days for LRYGB,  = 0.40). Compared with LRYGB, LSG was associated with significantly shorter operative time (78 ± 39  122 ± 54 minutes,  < 0.01), lower overall morbidity (2.3%  4.4%, AOR 0.53, CI 0.46-0.60,  < 0.01), lower serious morbidity (1.5%  2.3%, AOR 0.64, CI 0.53-0.76,  < 0.01), lower 30-day reoperation (1.2%  2.3%, AOR 0.52, CI 0.43-0.63,  < 0.01), and lower 30-day readmission (4.2%  6.6%, AOR 0.62, CI 0.55-0.69,  < 0.01).

The effect of MetS on clinical outcome in patients with cerebrovascular disease remains largely unknown because conflicting results have been published. This study aimed to determine the influence of MetS on the occurrence of restenosis after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).All patients who underwent CEA between June 2003 and December 2014 in two tertiary academic referral centres in The Netherlands were included. MetS was defined if three or more of the following criteria were present: hypertension, obesity, high fasting serum blood glucose, high serum triglycerides, or low serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of ipsilateral restenosis after index surgery. The secondary outcome measure was (all cause) mortality during follow up. For the primary analysis, missing data were multiply imputed using multivariable imputation by chained equations. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to perform an adjusted analysis on the multiply imputed data sets.A total of 1668 CEA procedures (in 1577 patients) were performed. The presence or absence of MetS could not be determined in 263 patients because of missing data. There was no significant difference in freedom from restenosis in the MetS group vs. the no-MetS group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-1.23; p = .10) or in all cause mortality (HR 1.20; 95% CI 0.94-1.54; p = .14).This study shows that MetS does not predict restenosis after CEA. Also, the presence of MetS did not influence patient survival negatively.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We report a rare cause of EAS in a 41-year-old woman, presenting with clinical features of Cushing's  which developed over several months. Biochemical tests revealed hypokalemic  alkalosis and high morning cortisol and ACTH levels. Further testing, including 24-hour urine analysis, late-night saliva and low-dose dexamethasone suppression test, confirmed hypercortisolism. An MRI of the pituitary gland was normal. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) revealed inconsistent results, with a raised basal gradient but no rise after CRH stimulation. Additional PET-CT showed intense  activity in the left nasal vault. Biopsy of this lesion revealed an unsuspected cause of Cushing's : an olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) with positive immunostaining for ACTH. Our patient underwent transnasal resection of the tumour mass, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Normalisation of cortisol and ACTH levels was seen immediately after surgery. Hydrocortisone substitution was started to prevent withdrawal symptoms. As the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis slowly recovered, daily hydrocortisone doses were tapered and stopped 4 months after surgery. Clinical Cushing's stigmata improved gradually.Ectopic ACTH  can originate from tumours outside the thoracoabdominal region, like the sinonasal cavity. The diagnostic accuracy of IPSS is not 100%: both false positives and false negatives may occur and might be due to a sinonasal tumour with ectopic ACTH secretion. Olfactory neuroblastoma (syn. esthesioneuroblastoma), named because of its sensory (olfactory) and neuroectodermal origin in the upper nasal cavity, is a rare malignant neoplasm. It should not be confused with neuroblastoma, a tumour of the sympathetic nervous system typically occurring in children. If one criticises MRI of the pituitary gland because of ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism, one should take a close look at the sinonasal field as well.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635966>Diabetes: a  and reproductive disorder in women.</a></h2><p>Reproductive dysfunction is a common but little studied complication of diabetes. The spectrum of reproductive health problems in diabetes is broad, and encompasses delayed puberty and menarche, menstrual cycle abnormalities, subfertility, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and potentially early menopause. Depending on the age at diagnosis of diabetes, reproductive problems can manifest early on in puberty, emerge later when fertility is desired, or occur during the climacteric period. Historically, women with type 1 diabetes have frequently had amenorrhoea and infertility, due to central hypogonadism. With the intensification of insulin therapy and improved  control, these problems have declined, but do persist. Additional reproductive implications of contemporary diabetes management are now emerging, including polycystic ovary  and hyperandrogenism, which are underpinned by insulin action on the ovary. The sharp rise in type 2 diabetes incidence in youth suggests that more women of reproductive age will encounter diabetes-related reproductive problems in their lifetimes. With an ever increasing number of young women living with diabetes, clinicians need to be aware of and equipped for the challenges of navigating reproductive health concerns across the lifespan.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Waist circumference (WC) was predictive for increased risk of FP in NAFLD patients. Elevated fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, serum amylase and lipase levels were associated with presence of severe FP ( value = 0.052,  value = 0.007,  value = 0.014;  value = 0.024, respectively). Presence of increased amounts of mesenteric fat was associated with severe FP ( value = 0.013). The results of this study demonstrated highly significant association between NAFLD and presence of FP. The model for predicting the presence of FP was designed with probability value above 6.5.  Pancreatic fat accumulation leads to worsening of pancreatic function which in turns exacerbates severity of  associated with both, NAFLD and NAFPD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626852>Mitochondrial dysfunction, AMPK activation and peroxisomal metabolism: a coherent scenario for non-canonical 3-methylglutaconic acidurias.</a></h2><p>The occurrence of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGA) is a well understood phenomenon in leucine oxidation and ketogenesis disorders (primary 3-MGAs). In contrast, its genesis in non-canonical (secondary) 3-MGAs, a growing-up group of disorders encompassing more than a dozen of inherited  diseases, is a mystery still remaining unresolved for three decades. To puzzle out this anthologic problem of metabolism, three clues were considered: (i) the variety of disorders suggests a common cellular target at the cross-road of  and signaling pathways, (ii) the response to leucine loading test only discriminative for primary but not secondary 3-MGAs suggests these latter are disorders of extramitochondrial HMG-CoA metabolism as also attested by their failure to increase 3-hydroxyisovalerate, a mitochondrial metabolite accumulating only in primary 3-MGAs, (iii) the peroxisome is an extramitochondrial site possessing its own pool and displaying metabolism of HMG-CoA, suggesting its possible involvement in producing extramitochondrial 3-methylglutaconate (3-MG). Following these clues provides a unifying common basis to non-canonical 3-MGAs: constitutive mitochondrial dysfunction induces AMPK activation which, by inhibiting early steps in cholesterol and fatty acid syntheses, pipelines cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA to peroxisomes where a rise in HMG-CoA followed by local dehydration and hydrolysis may lead to 3-MGA yield. Additional contributors are considered, notably for 3-MGAs associated with hyperammonemia, and to a lesser extent in CLPB deficiency.  and signaling itineraries followed by the proposed scenario are essentially sketched, being provided with compelling evidence from the literature coming in their support.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).
