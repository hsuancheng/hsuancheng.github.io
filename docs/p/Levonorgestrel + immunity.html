<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30898659>Impact of the contraceptive implant on maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality in rural Papua New Guinea: a retrospective observational cohort study.</a></h2><p>Using routinely collected birth data, this study sought to measure changes in maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality after introduction of the  contraceptive implant into a large, rural island population in Papua New Guinea (PNG).We conducted a retrospective observational study of birth records from 4251 births that occurred between January 2010 and December 2016 on Karkar Island, PNG. The primary outcome was the change in crude birth rate (CBR) before (2010-2012) and after (2014-2016) introduction of the implant. Secondary outcomes were the change in rates (per year/1000 births) of severe postpartum hemorrhage, postpartum infection, hospital readmission, prematurity (<37 weeks), low birth weight (<2500 g) and maternal and neonatal mortality. We also studied changes in the number of pregnancies affected by grand multiparity (≥4) and short interpregnancy interval (<12 months) for the same time periods. Data were analyzed using interrupted time series and Poisson regression.CBR was stable until 2012 and then declined from 2014 (p<.0001). Following introduction of the implant, the annual rate/1000 births of selected adverse birth outcomes decreased between 56% and 74% (p<.0001). The number of women with parity ≥4 who gave birth decreased by 59% (p<.0001), and the number with interpregnancy interval <12 months decreased by 64% (p<.0001).Introduction of the contraceptive implant was associated with reductions in CBR, maternal and neonatal morbidity, and the number of women with high-risk pregnancies giving birth.These results encourage efforts to increase knowledge and availability of the contraceptive implant in low- and middle-income countries such as PNG. In cases where it reduces the CBR and the number of women with high-risk pregnancies birthing, the implant may have a beneficial impact on maternal and neonatal morbidity.Copyright © 2019.

Although observational studies identify DMPA as an important STI risk factor, mechanisms underlying this connection are undefined.  (LNG) is another progestin used for hormonal contraception, but its effect on STI susceptibility is much less explored. Using a mouse model of genital herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection, we herein found that DMPA and LNG similarly reduced genital expression of the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein-1α (DSG1α), enhanced access of inflammatory cells to genital tissue by increasing mucosal epithelial permeability, and increased susceptibility to viral infection. Additional studies with uninfected mice revealed that DMPA-mediated increases in mucosal permeability promoted tissue inflammation by facilitating endogenous vaginal  invasion. Conversely, concomitant treatment of mice with DMPA and intravaginal estrogen restored mucosal barrier function and prevented HSV-2 infection. Evaluating ectocervical biopsy tissue from women before and 1 month after initiating DMPA remarkably revealed that inflammation and barrier protection were altered by treatment identically to changes seen in progestin-treated mice. Together, our work reveals DMPA and LNG diminish the genital mucosal barrier; a first-line defense against all STI, but may offer foundation for new contraceptive strategies less compromising of barrier protection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27599006>HIV and Hormonal Contraception: Bench and Bedside.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27437931>The Effects of Hormones and Vaginal Microflora on the Glycome of the Female Genital Tract: Cervical-Vaginal Fluid.</a></h2><p>In this study, we characterized the glycome of cervical-vaginal fluid, collected with a Catamenial cup. We quantified: glycosidase levels; sialic acid and high mannose specific lectin binding; mucins, MUC1, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC7; and albumin in the samples collected. These data were analyzed in the context of hormonal status (day of menstrual cycle, hormonal contraception use) and role, if any, of the type of the vaginal microflora present. When the Nugent score was used to stratify the subjects by microflora as normal, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis, several important differences were observed. The activities of four of six glycosidases in the samples from women with bacterial vaginosis were significantly increased when compared to normal or intermediate women: sialidase, P = <0.001; α-galactosidase, P = 0.006; β-galactosidase, P = 0.005; α-glucosidase, P = 0.056. Sialic acid binding sites as measured by two lectins, Maackia amurensis and Sambucus nigra binding, were significantly lower in women with BV compared to women with normal and intermediate scores (P = <0.0001 and 0.008 respectively). High mannose binding sites, a measure of innate  were also significantly lower in women with BV (P = <0.001). Additionally, we observed significant increases in MUC1, MUC4, MUC5AC, and MUC7 concentrations in women with BV (P = <0.001, 0.001, <0.001, 0.02 respectively). Among normal women we found that the membrane bound mucin MUC4 and the secreted MUC5AC were decreased in postmenopausal women (P = 0.02 and 0.07 respectively), while MUC7 (secreted) was decreased in women using -containing IUDs (P = 0.02). The number of sialic acid binding sites was lower in the postmenopausal group (P = 0.04), but the number of high mannose binding sites, measured with Griffithsin, was not significantly different among the 6 hormonal groups. The glycosidase levels in the cervical-vaginal mucus were rather low in the groups, with exception of α-glucosidase activity that was much lower in the postmenopausal group (P<0.001). These studies present compelling evidence that the vaginal ecosystem responds to the presence of different vaginal microorganisms. These effects were so influential that it required us to remove subjects with BV for data interpretation of the impact of hormones. We also suggest that certain changes occurring in vaginal/cervical proteins are due to bacteria or their products. Therefore, the quantitation of vaginal mucins and lectin binding offers a new method to monitor bacteria-host interactions in the female reproductive tract. The data suggest that some of the changes in these components are the result of host processing, such as the increases in mucin content, while the microflora is responsible for the increases in glycosidases and the decreases in lectin binding. The methods should be considered a valid marker for insult to the female genital tract.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27892938>Dendritic cell function and pathogen-specific T cell immunity are inhibited in mice administered  prior to intranasal Chlamydia trachomatis infection.</a></h2><p>The growing popularity of  (LNG)-releasing intra-uterine systems for long-acting reversible contraception provides strong impetus to define immunomodulatory properties of this exogenous progestin. In initial in vitro studies herein, we found LNG significantly impaired activation of human dendritic cell (DCs) and their capacity to promote allogeneic T cell proliferation. In follow-up studies in a murine model of intranasal Chlamydia trachomatis infection, we analogously found that LNG treatment prior to infection dramatically reduced CD40 expression in DCs isolated from draining lymph nodes at 2 days post infection (dpi). At 12 dpi, we also detected significantly fewer CD4 and CD8 T cells in the lungs of LNG-treated mice. This inhibition of DC activation and T cell expansion in LNG-treated mice also delayed chlamydial clearance and the resolution of pulmonary . Conversely, administering agonist anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody to LNG-treated mice at 1 dpi restored lung T cell numbers and chlamydial burden at 12 dpi to levels seen in infected controls. Together, these studies reveal that LNG suppresses DC activation and function, and inhibits formation of pathogen-specific T cell immunity. They also highlight the need for studies that define in vivo effects of LNG use on human host response to microbial pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25818668>The effect of menopause on the innate antiviral activity of cervicovaginal lavage.</a></h2><p>Reproductive hormones are known to impact innate mucosal immune function of the lower genital tract. Our objectives were to determine the effect of hormonal status on intrinsic antiviral (herpes simplex virus [HSV]-1, HSV-2, and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]-1) activity of cervicovaginal lavage (CVL).CVL was collected from 165 asymptomatic women including postmenopausal women (n = 29); women not on contraception in days 1-14 (n = 26) or days 15-28 (n = 27) of the menstrual cycle; and women using the  intrauterine device (n = 28), depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 28), or combined oral contraceptives (n = 27). The anti-HSV-1/-2 and the anti-HIV-1 activity of the CVL were measured using plaque assays and the Jurkat-Tat-CCR5 assay, respectively.CVL from all of the groups had modest antiviral activity. Anti-HIV-1 activity was decreased in CVL from postmenopausal women when compared to premenopausal women (11% vs 34%, P = .002). However, there was no difference in anti-HIV-1 activity among premenopausal women regardless of phase of menstrual cycle or contraceptive use. Anti-HIV-1 activity was associated with the protein content of the CVL (r = 0.44, P < .001). There was no difference in anti-HSV-1 or -2 activity by hormonal group.Menopause is associated with decreased innate HIV-1 activity in the lower genital tract, suggesting that factors in the vaginal fluid could play a role in increased susceptibility of HIV-1 infection in postmenopausal women. Hormonal contraceptive use, menopause, and phase of menstrual cycle did not have a measurable impact on the intrinsic anti-HSV-1 or -2 activity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We examined whether immunity in women using injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), combined oral contraceptives (COC), or no HCs differs by the presence of cervicovaginal infections. Immune mediators were quantified in cervical swabs from 832 HIV-uninfected reproductive-age Ugandans and Zimbabweans. Bacterial infections and HIV were diagnosed by PCR, genital herpes serostatus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), altered microflora by Nugent score, and Trichomonas vaginalis and Candida albicans infection by wet mount. Generalized linear models utilizing Box-Cox-Power transformation examined associations between levels of mediators, infection status, and HCs. In no-HC users, T. vaginalis was associated with broadest spectrum of aberrant immunity (higher interleukin 1β [IL-1β], IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein 3α [MIP-3α], β-defensin 2 [BD2], and IL-1 receptor antigen [IL-1RA]). In women with a normal Nugent score and no genital infection, compared to the no-HC group, COC users showed higher levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1RA, while DMPA users showed higher levels of RANTES and lower levels of BD2, both associated with HIV seroconversion. These effects of COC were blunted in the presence of gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, candidiasis, and an abnormal Nugent score; however, RANTES was increased among COC users with herpes, chlamydia, and abnormal Nugent scores. The effect of DMPA was exacerbated by lower levels of IL-1RA in gonorrhea, chlamydia, or herpes, SLPI in gonorrhea, and IL-1β, MIP-3α, and IL-1RA/IL1β ratio in trichomoniasis. Thus, the effects of HC on cervical immunity depend on the genital tract microenvironment, and a weakened mucosal barrier against HIV may be a combined resultant of genital tract infections and HC use.In this article, we show that in young reproductive-age women most vulnerable to HIV, hormonal contraceptives are associated with altered cervical immunity in a manner dependent on the presence of genital tract infections. Through altered immunity, hormones may predispose women to bacterial and viral pathogens; conversely, a preexisting specific infection or disturbed vaginal  may suppress the immune activation by  or exacerbate the suppressed immunity by DMPA, thus increasing HIV risk by their cumulative action. Clinical studies assessing the effects of contraception on HIV susceptibility and mucosal immunity may generate disparate results in populations that differ by  background or prevalence of undiagnosed genital tract infections. A high prevalence of asymptomatic infections among HC users that remain undiagnosed and untreated raises even more concerns in light of their combined effects on biomarkers of HIV risk. The molecular mechanisms of the vaginal microbiome's simultaneous interactions with hormones and HIV remain to be elucidated.Copyright © 2015 Fichorova et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29917111> and Female Genital Tract : Time for a Closer Look.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27234589>Corrigendum to "effect of progestins on immunity: medroxyprogesterone but not norethisterone or  suppresses the function of T cells and pDCs" [contraception 90 (2014) 123-129].</a></h2><p></p></html>
