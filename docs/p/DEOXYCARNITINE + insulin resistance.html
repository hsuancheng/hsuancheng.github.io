<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27112275>The impact of altered carnitine availability on acylcarnitine metabolism, energy expenditure and glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Acylcarnitines are fatty acid oxidation (FAO) intermediates, which have been implicated in diet-induced insulin resistance. Elevated acylcarnitine levels are found in obese, insulin resistant humans and rodents, and coincide with lower free carnitine. We hypothesized that increasing free carnitine levels by administration of the carnitine precursor γ-butyrobetaine (γBB) could facilitate FAO, thereby improving insulin sensitivity.C57BL/6N mice were fed with a high fat or chow diet with or without γBB supplementation (n=10 per group). After 8weeks of diet, indirect calorimetry, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity tests were performed. AC profiles and carnitine biosynthesis intermediates were analyzed in plasma and tissues by tandem mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography tandem MS.γBB supplementation did not facilitate FAO, was unable to curb bodyweight and did not prevent impaired glucose homeostasis in the HFD fed mice in spite of marked alterations in the acylcarnitine profiles in plasma and liver. Remarkably, γBB did not affect the acylcarnitine profile in other tissues, most notably muscle. Administration of a bolus acetylcarnitine also caused significant changes in plasma and liver, but not in muscle acylcarnitine profiles, again without effect on glucose tolerance.Altogether, increasing carnitine availability affects acylcarnitine profiles in plasma and liver but does not modulate glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity. This may be due to the lack of an effect on muscle acylcarnitine profiles, as muscle tissue is an important contributor to whole body insulin sensitivity. These results warrant caution on making associations between plasma acylcarnitine levels and insulin resistance.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Resistant starches (RS) alter the human microbiota. We sought to determine whether diets varying in RS and carbohydrate (CHO) content affect plasma TMAO levels. We also assessed postprandial glucose and insulin responses and plasma lipid changes to diets high and low in RS. In a cross-over trial, fifty-two men and women consumed a 2-week baseline diet (41 percentage of energy (%E) CHO, 40 % fat, 19 % protein), followed by 2-week high- and low-RS diets separated by 2-week washouts. RS diets were assigned at random within the context of higher (51-53 %E) v. lower CHO (39-40 %E) intake. Measurements were obtained in the fasting state and, for glucose and insulin, during a meal test matching the composition of the assigned diet. With lower CHO intake, plasma TMAO, carnitine, betaine and γ-butyrobetaine concentrations were higher after the high- v. low-RS diet (P<0·01 each). These metabolites were not differentially affected by high v. low RS when CHO intake was high. Although the high-RS meal reduced postprandial insulin and glucose responses when CHO intake was low (P<0·01 each), RS did not affect fasting lipids, lipoproteins, glucose or insulin irrespective of dietary CHO content. In conclusion, a lower-CHO diet high in RS was associated with higher plasma TMAO levels. These findings, together with the absence of change in fasting lipids, suggest that short-term high-RS diets do not improve markers of cardiometabolic health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29325058>Serum Carnitine Metabolites and Incident Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Patients With Suspected Stable Angina Pectoris.</a></h2><p>Carnitine and its metabolites are centrally involved in fatty acid metabolism. Although elevated circulating concentrations have been observed in  and insulin resistance, prospective studies examining whether these metabolites are associated with incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) are sparse.We performed a comprehensive evaluation of metabolites along the carnitine pathway relative to incident T2D.A total of 2519 patients (73.1% men) with coronary artery disease, but without T2D, were followed for median 7.7 years until the end of 2009, during which 173 (6.9%) new cases of T2D were identified. Serum levels of free carnitine, its precursors trimethyllysine (TML) and γ-butyrobetaine, and the esters acetyl-, propionyl-, (iso)valeryl-, octanoyl-, and palmitoylcarnitine were measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Risk associations were explored by logistic regression and reported per (log-transformed) standard deviation increment.Median age at inclusion was 62 years and median body mass index (BMI) 26.0 kg/m2. In models adjusted for age, sex, fasting status, BMI, estimated glomerular filtration rate, glycated hemoglobin A1c, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and study center, serum levels of TML and palmitoylcarnitine associated positively [odds ratio (95% confidence interval), 1.22 (1.04 to 1.43) and 1.24 (1.04 to 1.49), respectively], whereas γ-butyrobetaine associated negatively [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.81 (0.66 to 0.98)] with T2D risk.Serum levels of TML, γ-butyrobetaine, and the long-chained palmitoylcarnitine predict long-term risk of T2D independently of traditional risk factors, possibly reflecting dysfunctional fatty acid metabolism in patients susceptible to T2D development.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27730694>Acylcarnitines as markers of exercise-associated fuel partitioning, xenometabolism, and potential signals to muscle afferent neurons.</a></h2><p>What is the central question of this study? Does improved metabolic health and insulin sensitivity following a weight-loss and fitness intervention in sedentary, obese women alter exercise-associated fuel metabolism and incomplete mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO), as tracked by blood acylcarnitine patterns? What is the main finding and its importance? Despite improved fitness and blood sugar control, indices of incomplete mitochondrial FAO increased in a similar manner in response to a fixed load acute exercise bout; this indicates that intramitochondrial muscle FAO is inherently inefficient and is tethered directly to ATP turnover. With insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes mellitus, mismatches between mitochondrial fatty acid fuel delivery and oxidative phosphorylation/tricarboxylic acid cycle activity may contribute to inordinate accumulation of short- or medium-chain acylcarnitine fatty acid derivatives [markers of incomplete long-chain fatty acid oxidation (FAO)]. We reasoned that incomplete FAO in muscle would be ameliorated concurrent with improved insulin sensitivity and fitness following a ∼14 week training and weight-loss intervention in obese, sedentary, insulin-resistant women. Contrary to this hypothesis, overnight-fasted and exercise-induced plasma C4-C14 acylcarnitines did not differ between pre- and postintervention phases. These metabolites all increased robustly with exercise (∼45% of pre-intervention peak oxygen consumption) and decreased during a 20 min cool-down. This supports the idea that, regardless of insulin sensitivity and fitness, intramitochondrial muscle β-oxidation and attendant incomplete FAO are closely tethered to absolute ATP turnover rate. Acute exercise also led to branched-chain amino acid acylcarnitine derivative patterns suggestive of rapid and transient diminution of branched-chain amino acid flux through the mitochondrial branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. We confirmed our prior novel observation that a weight-loss/fitness intervention alters plasma xenometabolites [i.e. cis-3,4-methylene-heptanoylcarnitine and γ-butyrobetaine (a co-metabolite possibly derived in part from gut bacteria)], suggesting that host metabolic health regulated gut microbe metabolism. Finally, we considered whether acylcarnitine metabolites signal to muscle-innervating afferents; palmitoylcarnitine at concentrations as low as 1-10 μm activated a subset (∼2.5-5%) of these neurons ex vivo. This supports the hypothesis that in addition to tracking exercise-associated shifts in fuel metabolism, muscle acylcarnitines act as signals of exertion to short-loop somatosensory-motor circuits or to the brain.© 2016 The Authors.
