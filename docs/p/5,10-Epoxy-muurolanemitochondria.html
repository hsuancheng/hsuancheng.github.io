Percutaneous skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from the m. vastus lateralis to measure capillarisation, and fibre type-specific localisation and distribution of myoglobin and mitochondrial content using quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy.Splenic volume was not different between groups. Reticulocytes, red blood cells and haemoglobin concentrations were higher (+ 24%, p < 0.05; + 9%, p < 0.05; + 3%, p < 0.05; respectively) and mean cell volume was lower (- 6.%, p < 0.05) in the EBHD compared with ND. Haematocrit was not different between groups. Capillary density was greater (+ 19%; p < 0.05) in the EBHD. The diffusion distance (R) was lower in type I versus type II fibres for both groups (EBHD, p < 0.01; ND, p < 0.001), with a lower R for type I fibres in the EBHD versus ND (- 13%, p < 0.05). Myoglobin content was higher in type I than type II fibres in EBHD (+ 27%; p < 0.01) and higher in the type I fibres of EBHD than ND (+ 27%; p < 0.05). No fibre type differences in myoglobin content were observed in ND. Mitochondrial content was higher in type I than type II fibres in EBHD (+ 35%; p < 0.05), with no fibre type differences in ND or between groups.In conclusion, EBDH demonstrate enhanced oxygen storage in both blood and skeletal muscle and a more efficient oxygen exchange capacity between blood and skeletal muscle versus ND.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643037>High Concentration of Ketone Body β-Hydroxybutyrate Modifies Synaptic Vesicle Cycle and Depolarizes Plasma Membrane of Rat Brain Synaptosomes.</a></h1><p>Ketoacidosis is a dangerous complication of diabetes mellitus in which plasma levels of ketone bodies can reach 20-25 mM. This condition is life-threatening. In contrast, a ketogenic diet, achieving plasma levels of ketone bodies of about 4- mM, can be used for treating different brain diseases. However, the factors leading to the conversion of the neuroprotective ketone bodies' action to the neurotoxic action during ketoacidosis are still unknown. We investigated the influence of high concentration (25 mM) of the main ketone body, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), on intrasynaptosomal pH (pHi), synaptic vesicle cycle, plasma membrane, and mitochondrial potentials. Using the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM, it was shown that BHB at concentrations of 8 and 25 mM did not influence pHi in synaptosomes. By means of the fluorescent dye acridine orange, it was demonstrated that 25 mM of BHB had no effect on exocytosis but inhibited compensatory endocytosis by -fold. Increasing buffer capacity with 25 mM HEPES did not affect endocytosis. Glucose abolished BHB-induced endocytosis inhibition. Using the fluorescent dye DiSC3(), it was shown that 25 mM of BHB induced a significant plasma membrane depolarization. This effect was not impacted by glucose. Using the fluorescent dye rhodamine-123, it was shown that BHB alone (25 mМ) did not alter the potential of intrasynaptosomal .Importantly, the high concentration of BHB (25 mМ) causes the depolarization of the plasma membrane and stronger inhibition of endocytosis compared with the intermediate concentration (8 mM).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31466233>A Cyclic Pentamethinium Salt Induces Cancer Cell Cytotoxicity through Mitochondrial Disintegration and Metabolic Collapse.</a></h1><p>Cancer cells preferentially utilize glycolysis for ATP production even in aerobic conditions (the Warburg effect) and adapt mitochondrial processes to their specific needs. Recent studies indicate that altered mitochondrial activities in cancer represent an actionable target for therapy. We previously showed that salt 1-, a quinoxaline unit (with cytotoxic activity) incorporated into a meso-substituted pentamethinium salt (with mitochondrial selectivity and fluorescence properties), displayed potent cytotoxic effects in vitro and in vivo, without significant toxic effects to normal tissues. Here, we investigated the cytotoxic mechanism of salt 1- compared to its analogue, salt 1-, with an extended side carbon chain. Live cell imaging demonstrated that salt 1-, but not 1-, is rapidly incorporated into , correlating with increased cytotoxicity of salt 1-. The accumulation in  led to their fragmentation and loss of function, accompanied by increased autophagy/mitophagy. Salt 1- preferentially activated AMP-activated kinase and inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways, sensors of cellular metabolism, but did not induce apoptosis. These data indicate that salt 1- cytotoxicity involves mitochondrial perturbation and disintegration, and such compounds are promising candidates for targeting  as a weak spot of cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31509780>A network pharmacology approach to discover action mechanisms of Yangxinshi Tablet for improving energy metabolism in chronic ischemic heart failure.</a></h1><p>Most cardiovascular diseases ultimately result in heart failure, an intractable problem in modern medicine. Yangxinshi tablet (YXS) is a Chinese medicine formula that is used clinically to treat coronary heart disease. However, the active compounds, potential targets, and pharmacological and molecular mechanism of its anti-heart failure activity remain unclear. Therefore, further investigation is required.Active ingredients and potential targets of YXS for treating heart failure have been reported previously. However, the molecular functions or biological processes of YXS in energy metabolism have not been discovered. To date, no experimental study to validate the potential anti-heart failure mechanism of YXS. The aim of this study was to study the therapeutic effect of YXS on rats with chronic ischemic heart failure by evaluating rat cardiac function and exercise tolerance, and to explore its potential mechanism by network pharmacology, western blotting, quantitative RT-PCR and histological analysis.In this investigation, chronic ischemic heart failure rats were randomly assigned to five groups: control group (sham operation), model group (0.% CMC-Na), trimetazidine group (positive control) and two YXS groups (low- and high-dose groups). Experimental rats were treated by gavage with 10 mg/kg/d (clinical equivalent dose) trimetazidine (TMZ), 500 mg/kg/d (clinical equivalent dose) YXS and 1000 mg/kg/d YXS, respectively, for  weeks. The cardiac functions of rats were detected by High-Resolution In Vivo Imaging System. We elucidated novel understanding of the active compounds of YXS in rat plasma and predicted the energy metabolism related targets and processes for heart failure. Then, we validated experimentally the targets and mechanism of YXS on these pathological processes in vivo.It was found that YXS was able to effectively improve cardiac LVIDs, LVEDV, LVESV and EF, decrease myocardial oxygen consumption and reduce myocardial infarct size in rats with chronic ischemic heart failure was similar to that of TMZ. We identified 63 major candidate targets for YXS that are closely to heart failure progression. Enrichment analysis revealed key targets for YXS associated to oxygen delivery, glucose utilization, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Meanwhile, we validated that YXS could promote the expression of downstream HIF-1α, PGC1α and GLUT4 by increasing phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt, mTOR, rpS6 and AMPK. The results show that YXS could activate related PI3K/Akt/mTOR/rpS6/HIF-1α and AMPK/PGC1α/GLUT4 signaling pathways in chronic ischemic heart failure rats. Further experiments demonstrated that YXS increased mitochondrial biogenesis in chronic ischemic heart failure rats and improved exercise tolerance CONCLUSION: YXS treated chronic ischemic heart failure through activating its targets which play pivotal roles in oxygen delivery, glucose utilization and mitochondrial biogenesis to improve energy metabolism through a multi-component, multi-level, multi-target, multi-pathway and multi-mechanism approaches.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

For instance, at the cellular level, the viscosity of subcellular organelles (, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus, etc.) is much greater than that of cytoplasm; at the organismal level, compared with normal states of health, blood or lymphatic fluid viscosity will increase to some extent in diabetes, hypertension, inflammation, tumors and so on. However, due to the design shortcoming, there is a lack of efficient tool for detecting biomolecules in viscous living systems. Herein, we propose a rational design strategy for constructing ratiometric fluorescent probes with superior response signal-to-background (S/B) ratio in viscous systems based on rigid-fluorophore-molecular rotor platform, and a practical sulfur dioxide (SO2) probe (RFC-MRC) based on conmarin-cyanine dyad was prepared as a proof-of-concept. The probe performs a significant enhancement (71.-fold) of ratiometric response signal stimulated by SO2 in viscous aqueous media. The cationic probe can selectively in  and was successfully utilized to sense SO2 in living HeLa cells through ratiometric fluorescence imaging. What's more, in the fluorescence imaging experiments of monitoring SO2 in apoptotic cells using probe RFC-MRC, a more obvious superior of S/B ratio was observed in the early apoptotic cells than in the lately apoptotic cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610916>Zinc protects chondrocytes from monosodium iodoacetate-induced damage by enhancing ATP and mitophagy.</a></h1><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized with articular cartilage degradation, and monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-treated chondrocyte is the most commonly used model for mimicking OA progression. Zinc protects chondrocytes from MIA-induced damage. Here, we explored the protective effects of 25 μM zinc on  μM MIA-treated SW1353 cells (human chondrosarcoma cell line) through the analysis of energy metabolism- and autophagy-related parameters. We found that the exposure of SW1353 cells to MIA decreased ATP levels, expression of glycolysis-related proteins, including glucose transporter 1, hexokinase 2, and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit alpha, and the levels of mitochondrial complex I, II, IV, and V subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. MIA treatment also decreased the expression of autophagy-related proteins, including autophagic elongation protein  (ATG5), ATG7, and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3-II) and mitophagy-related proteins, including phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), ubiquitin, and p62. These results indicate that MIA interferes with energy metabolism and the autophagic clearance of dysfunctional  (so called mitophagy). Interestingly, zinc exposure could almost completely reverse the effects of MIA, suggesting its potential protective role against OA progression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The original model of the MPTP that proposed the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) as the inner membrane pore-forming component was challenged when  from Ant1/2 double null mouse liver still had MPTP activity. Because mice express three  genes, we reinvestigated whether the ANTs comprise the MPTP.

The rate of oxidation of endogenous substrates by  was determined by the tissue and was .2±0.6 and 8.13±1.4 (ng-atom O)×min×mg protein for liver and kidney of intact animals, respectively. After 21 vibration sessions against the background of inhibition of NAD-dependent substrate oxidation in liver , the rate metabolism of exogenous succinic acid increased by 44% and then decreased with prolongation of the effect, which indicated impaired function of the respiratory chain. Similar fluctuations of the parameters were revealed in kidney , though their amplitude was lower. The study of bioenergetic mechanisms of hypoxia in various tissues makes it possible to determine the targets for the pharmacological action of antihypoxic drugs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627361>Effects of Five Substances with Different Modes of Action on Cathepsin H, C and L Activities in Zebrafish Embryos.</a></h1><p>Cathepsins have been proposed as biomarkers of chemical exposure in the zebrafish embryo model but it is unclear whether they can also be used to detect sublethal stress. The present study evaluates three cathepsin types as candidate biomarkers in zebrafish embryos. In addition to other functions, cathepsins are also involved in yolk lysosomal processes for the internal nutrition of embryos of oviparous animals until external feeding starts. The baseline enzyme activity of cathepsin types H, C and L during the embryonic development of zebrafish in the first 96 h post fertilisation was studied. Secondly, the effect of leupeptin, a known cathepsin inhibitor, and four embryotoxic xenobiotic compounds with different modes of action (phenanthrene-baseline toxicity; rotenone-an inhibitor of electron transport chain in ; DNOC (Dinitro-ortho-cresol)-an inhibitor of ATP synthesis; and tebuconazole-a sterol biosynthesis inhibitor) on  cathepsin H, C and L total activities have been tested. The positive control leupeptin showed effects on cathepsin L at a 20-fold lower concentration compared to the respective LC (0.4 mM) of the zebrafish embryo assay (FET). The observed effects on the enzyme activity of the four other xenobiotics were not or just slightly more sensitive (factor of 1. to 3), but the differences did not reach statistical significance. Results of this study indicate that the analysed cathepsins are not susceptible to toxins other than the known peptide-like inhibitors. However, specific cathepsin inhibitors might be identified using the zebrafish embryo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659873>Muscle Insulin Resistance in Youth with Obesity and Normoglycemia is Associated with Altered Fat Metabolism.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to phenotype and compare adipose, hepatic, and muscle insulin sensitivity (IS) in a diet- and physical activity-controlled cohort of normoglycemic youth with obesity with that of participants without obesity (controls) to distinguish early metabolic abnormalities in pediatric obesity.Thirty-eight participants (17 in the control group [BMI < 85th percentile] and 21 youth with obesity [BMI ≥ 95th percentile]; age: 12-21 years; 76% female; Tanner stage 4-; sedentary) were enrolled. Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by insulin. Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003).  postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty acid concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS. Free fatty acids and liver fat were inversely associated with muscle IS, which argues for lipid-targeted interventions.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535642>tRNA cleavage: a new insight.</a></h1><p>Over the past decades, tRNA was found to be a rich hub of RNA modifications such as 1-methyladenosine and -methycytosine modifications and others, holding more than half of all modifications occurring in RNA molecules. Moreover, tRNA was discovered to be a source of various small noncoding RNA species, such as the stress induced angiogenin cleaved tRNA halves (tiRNA) or the miRNA like tRNA derived fragments. tRNA cleavage under stress was fist discovered in bacteria and later was found to be conserved across different species, including mammals. Under cellular stress conditions, tRNA undergoes conformational changes and angiogenin cleaves it into 3' and ' halves. 'tiRNA halves were shown to repress protein translations. tRNA cleavage is thought of to be a cytoprotective mechanism by which cells evade apoptosis, however some data hints to the opposite; that tiRNA are cytotoxic or at least related to apoptosis initiation. tRNA cleavage also was shown to be affected by tRNA modifications via different enzymes in the cytosol and . In this review, we will highlight the biology of tRNA cleavage, show the evidence of it being cytoprotective or a marker of cell death and shed a light on its role in disease models and human diseases as well as possible future directions in this field of RNA research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31548865>Xylose utilization stimulates mitochondrial production of isobutanol and 2-methyl-1-butanol in .</a></h1><p>Branched-chain higher alcohols (BCHAs), including isobutanol and 2-methyl-1-butanol, are promising advanced biofuels, superior to ethanol due to their higher energy density and better compatibility with existing gasoline infrastructure. Compartmentalizing the isobutanol biosynthetic pathway in yeast  is an effective way to produce BCHAs from glucose. However, to improve the sustainability of biofuel production, there is great interest in developing strains and processes to utilize lignocellulosic biomass, including its hemicellulose component, which is mostly composed of the pentose xylose.In this work, we rewired the xylose isomerase assimilation and mitochondrial isobutanol production pathways in the budding yeast . We then increased the flux through these pathways by making gene deletions of , , and , to develop a strain (YZy197) that produces as much as 4 g/L of BCHAs (3.10 ± 0.18 g isobutanol/L and 0.91 ± 0.02 g 2-methyl-1-butanol/L) from xylose. This represents approximately a 28-fold improvement on the highest isobutanol titers obtained from xylose previously reported in yeast and the first report of 2-methyl-1-butanol produced from xylose. The yield of total BCHAs is 57.2 ± .2 mg/g xylose, corresponding to ~ 14% of the maximum theoretical yield. Respirometry experiments show that xylose increases mitochondrial activity by as much as 7.3-fold compared to glucose.The enhanced levels of mitochondrial BCHA production achieved, even without disrupting ethanol byproduct formation, arise mostly from xylose activation of mitochondrial activity and are correlated with slow rates of sugar consumption.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31499543>Contrasting Role of Concentration in Rivaroxaban Induced Toxicity and Oxidative Stress in Isolated Kidney .</a></h1><p>Rivaroxaban as a small molecule is able to directly and reversibly inhibit the factor Xa. This study was designed to figure out the evaluation effect of rivaroxaban on  obtained from rat kidneys. We isolated  from rat kidneys using gradient centrifugation. Then, the toxicity parameters including succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial swelling, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse and cytochrome c release were measured in kidneys  following the exposure to rivaroxaban. The results showed that rivaroxaban (1.4 and 2.8 mM) raised the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, swelling in the , collapse in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and cytochrome c release in the  isolated from kidneys. While, rivaroxaban at a higher concentration of .6 mM showed the opposite effect compared to other lower concentrations. The results indicate that rivaroxaban may have antioxidant effects at high concentrations.

The characteristics, stability and the effect of C3G liposomes on GES-1 cells were explored. Results showed that the particle size and encapsulation efficiency (EE%) of C3G liposomes were 258.9 ± .06 nm and 77.%, respectively. DPPH assay showed that liposomes encapsulation can improve the antioxidant of C3G, while the ABTS assay was opposite. Stability study showed the C3G liposome were unstable under extended storage time. The effects of C3G liposomes on GES-1 cells showed that C3G liposomes can decrease the ROS levels of GES-1 and had negligible effects on cell viability and mitochondrial structure.

These cells are rich in  and peroxisomes, the two organelles that mediate fatty acid oxidation. Emerging evidence shows that both fatty acid pathways are regulated by reversible posttranslational modifications, particularly by lysine acylation. Sirtuin  (Sirt5), which localizes to both  and peroxisomes, reverses post-translational lysine acylation on several enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation. However, the role of the Sirt5 in regulating kidney energy metabolism has yet to be determined.We subjected male Sirt5-deficient mice (either +/- or -/-) and wild-type controls, as well as isolated proximal tubule cells, to two different AKI models (ischemia-induced or cisplatin-induced AKI). We assessed kidney function and injury with standard techniques and measured fatty acid oxidation by the catabolism of C-labeled palmitate to CO.Sirt5 was highly expressed in proximal tubular epithelial cells. At baseline,  knockout ( ) mice had modestly decreased mitochondrial function but significantly increased fatty acid oxidation, which was localized to the peroxisome. Although no overt kidney phenotype was observed in  mice,  mice had significantly improved kidney function and less tissue damage compared with controls after either ischemia-induced or cisplatin-induced AKI. This coincided with higher peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation compared with  fatty acid oxidation in the  proximal tubular epithelial cells.Our findings indicate that Sirt5 regulates the balance of mitochondrial versus peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation in proximal tubular epithelial cells to protect against injury in AKI.

When activated, Ire1 splices and matures the HAC1 mRNA which encodes a transcription-factor protein that is responsible for the gene induction of the UPR. Here we propose that this signaling pathway is also used in cellular adaptation upon diauxic shift, in which cells shift from fermentative phase (fast growth) to mitochondrial respiration phase (slower growth). Splicing of the HAC1 mRNA was induced upon diauxic shift of cells cultured in glucose-based media or in cells transferred from glucose-based medium to non-fermentable glycerol-based medium. Activation of Ire1 in this situation was not due to ER accumulation of unfolded proteins, and was mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are byproducts of aerobic respiration. Here we also show that the UPR induced by diauxic shift causes enlargement of the , and thus contributes to cellular growth under non-fermentative conditions, in addition to transcriptional induction of the canonical UPR target genes, which includes those encoding ER-located molecular chaperones and protein-folding enzymes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31464433>Calcium Alleviates Fluoride-Induced Bone Damage by Inhibiting Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction.</a></h1><p>Excessive fluoride mainly causes skeletal lesions. Recently, it has been reported that an appropriate level of calcium can alleviate fluorosis. However, the appropriate concentration and mechanism of calcium addition is unclear. Hence, we evaluated the histopathology and ultrastructure, DNA fragmentation, hormonal imbalances, biomechanical levels, and expression of apoptosis-related genes after treating the rats with 150 mg/L NaF and different concentrations of CaCO. Our results suggested that NaF induced the histopathological and ultrastructural injury, with a concomitant increase in the DNA fragmentation ( < 0.05) and serum OC (17. ± 0.89 pmoL/L) at 120 days. In addition, the qRT-PCR and western blotting results indicated that NaF exposure upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of Bax, Calpain, Caspase 12, Caspase 9, Caspase 7, Caspase 3, CAD, PARP, and AIF while downregulated Bcl-2 ( < 0.01) and decreased the bone ultimate load by 27.1%, the ultimate stress by 10.1%, and the ultimate deformity by 23.3% at 120 days. However, 1% CaCO supplementation decreased the serum OC (14.7 ± 0.65 pmoL/L), bone F content ( < 0.01), and fracture and breakage of collagen fibers and changed the expression of endoplasmic reticulum pathway-related genes and proteins at 120 days. Further, 1% CaCO supplementation increased the bone ultimate load by 20.9%, the ultimate stress by 4.89%, and the ultimate deformity by 21.6%. In summary, we conclude that 1% CaCO supplementation alleviated fluoride-induced bone damage by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575649>A concerted metabolic shift in early forebrain alters the CSF proteome and depends on MYC downregulation for mitochondrial maturation.</a></h1><p>Massive, coordinated cellular changes accompany the transition of central nervous system (CNS) progenitors from forebrain neurectodermal cells to specified neuroepithelial cells. We have previously found that MYC regulates the changing ribosomal and proteostatic landscapes in mouse forebrain precursors at embryonic days E8. and E10. (before and after neural tube closure; NTC) (Chau et al., 2018). Here, we demonstrate parallel coordinated transcriptional changes in metabolic machinery during this same stage of forebrain specification. Progenitors showed striking mitochondrial structural changes transitioning from glycolytic cristae at E8., to more traditional  at E10.. Accordingly, glucose use shifted in progenitors such that E8. progenitors relied on glycolysis, and after NTC increasingly used oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic shift was matched by changes in surrounding amniotic and cerebrospinal fluid proteomes. Importantly, these mitochondrial morphological shifts depend on MYC downregulation. Together, our findings demonstrate that metabolic shifting accompanies dynamic organelle and proteostatic remodeling of progenitor cells during the earliest stages of forebrain development.© 2019.

However, non-surgical treatments for uterine myomas have not been fully evaluated. In Korea and China, Gyejibongnyeong-hwan (GBH) is widely used to treat gynecological diseases. Thus, we investigated the effects of GBH in human uterine myoma cells (hUtMCs). The hUtMCs were collected from patients undergoing curative surgery. Cell viability was analyzed  3-(4,-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. The expression levels of p53, Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved-caspase-3, and caspase-9 were determined by Western blotting. Apoptosis and ROS levels were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. First, we determined the adequate concentration that did not affect normal cells, and then investigated the time-dependent anti-neoplastic effect of GBH to decide the appropriate treatment time under a non-toxic concentration. Cell viability and number were significantly reduced by GBH at 48 h in a dose-dependent manner (0-200 µg/ml). The ratio of Bax to Bcl2 and expression of p53, cleaved-caspase-3, and caspase-9 increased, representing GBH induced apoptosis in uterine leiomyomas. In addition, preliminary tests using pan-caspase inhibitor/p53 inhibitor with GBH rescued the GBH-mediated apoptotic effect. Furthermore, GBH significantly increased the mitochondrial ROS concentration, and preliminary test showed that  ROS scavenger reduced the percentages of early apoptosis cell. These results suggest that GBH may induce apoptosis of leiomyomas and demonstrated that GBH can be a potential therapeutic and/or preventive agent for uterine leiomyomas.Copyright © 2019 Lee, Choi, Ha, Ji, Shin and Jung.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31507195>Secondary dengue infection in immunocompetent murine model leads to heart tissue damage.</a></h1><p>Dengue, considered the most important arthropod-borne viral disease affecting humans, is transmitted by the bite of mosquitoes of the genus Aedes and caused by one of the four distinct serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4). Infection with one of the four serotypes provides lifelong homotypic immunity. However, immunity against the heterologous serotypes is transient. As a consequence, secondary infection may lead to severer manifestations due to cross-reactivity of antibodies and T-cells. Over 500,000 people are hospitalized every year and around 2, million, living in endemic areas, are at risk of infection. Given the background, the development of vaccines and anti-DENV drugs is of the utmost importance, as is the characterization of an animal model for testing them. The purpose of this study was to investigate ultrastructural alterations caused by DENV secondary infection in BALB/c mice heart. To achieve our goal, six BALB/c mice were infected with DENV-1 and, 4 months later, reinfected with DENV-2. Uninfected mice were used as negative controls. Heart samples were collected and processed for ultrastructural and histopathological analysis. Our results showed edema, endothelium activation characterized by the presence of transport vesicles, free platelets in interstitium,  presenting rarefied matrix and degenerated cristae, and disorganization of muscle fibers. These results point not only to BALB/c mice susceptibility to DENV infection, but also to the fact that, although it is not an often reported occurrence, dengue can lead to heart damage.

Therefore, we compared neurotoxicity induced by the mitochondrial inhibitor rotenone (ROT,  or 10 μM for 24 h) in SH-SY5Y cells cultured with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% FBS, or 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, serum-free). In addition, C57BL/6J mice were injected with 12 μg ROT into the right striatum, and brains examined by histology and Western blotting 2 weeks later for evidence of DAergic cell death and the underlying signaling mechanisms. ROT dose-dependently reduced SH-SY5Y cell viability in all serum groups without a significant effect of serum concentration. ROT injection also significantly reduced immunoreactivity for the DAergic cell marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in both the mouse striatum and SNpc. Western blotting revealed that ROT inhibited TH and Parkin expression while increasing α-syn and PINK1 expression in both SH-SY5Y cells and injected mice, consistent with disruption of mitochondrial function. Moreover, expression levels of the mTOR signaling pathway components mTORC, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), ULK1, and ATG13 were altered in ROT-induced PD. Further, serum level influenced mTOR signaling in the absence of ROT and the changes in response to ROT. Signs of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and altered expression of tethering proteins mediating -associated ER contacts (MAMs) were also altered concomitant with ROT-induced neurodegeneration. Taken together, this study demonstrates that complex mechanism involving mitochondrial dysfunction, altered mTOR nutrient-sensing pathways, ER stress, and disrupted MAM protein dynamics are involved in DAergic neurodegeneration in response to ROT.Copyright © 2019 Ramalingam, Huh and Lee.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31506728>Bioaccumulation of TBT and Its Cellular Toxic Effects on the Freshwater Prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii.</a></h1><p>To test the toxic effects of tributyltin (TBT), Macrobrachium rosenbergii were exposed to three concentrations of TBT viz. 10 ng/L, 100 ng/L and 1000 ng/L for 90 days. The bioaccumulation of TBT level varied in hepatopancreas based upon dose dependent manner. Histopathological results revealed the reduction in basement membrane thickness, disruption of the hepatopancreatic tubules and abnormal lumen in hepatopancreas of TBT treated prawns. The ultrastructure of the control prawn showed normal architecture of cellular organelles with prominent nuclei in hepatocytes. On the other hand, many vacuoles, irregular arrangements of microvilli, swollen , distorted rough endoplasmic reticulum cisternaes and abnormal nucleus were seen in the TBT treated group. Further, the biochemical and vitellogenin content were altered remarkably due to TBT exposure. It directly indicated that TBT had conspicuously inhibited the vitellogenesis. Therefore, it was inferred that the administration of TBT has considerably affected the hepatopancreatic functions in M. rosenbergii.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574396>Cryopreservation of rooster semen: Evidence for the epigenetic modifications of thawed sperm.</a></h1><p>Although semen cryopreservation is an important, widely used technique for long-term sperm storage, it not only induces partially irreversible damages to sperm but might also deteriorate anatomical, biochemical, and structural organelles. These cellular and epigenetic modifications are the main reasons underlying the decline in sperm motility and fertility during the freeze-thaw process. Using the two Lake and Beltsville semen extenders, the present study aims to evaluate the epigenetic patterns (DNA methylation and histone modification), cellular parameters (e.g., membrane integrity, viability, DNA stability,  activity, and apoptosis status), and fertility potential of rooster semen collected from six mature roosters before and after cryopreservation according to a standard protocol. The results show that cryopreservation leads to significantly (P < 0.05) reduced values of the parameters examined when compared with those of fresh sperms. While the extenders used exhibit no difference with respect to DNA methylation (DNMT), the Lake extender leads to significant reductions (P < 0.05) in H3K9 acetylation (17.4 ± 1.8) and H3K4 methylation (42 ± 2.3) compared to the Beltsville (9.2 ± 1.8 and 23 ± 2.3, respectively). Compared to the Beltsville extender, the Lake one is also observed to yield a significantly (P < 0.05) superior sperm quality in terms of total motility (TM; 77.2 ± 1.6 vs. 68.3 ± 1.6), average path velocity (VAP; 71 ± 1.4 vs. 53 ± 1.4), and straight-line velocity (VSL; 52 ± 1. vs. 34 ± 1.) as well as significantly (P < 0.05) higher viability (60 ± 1.69 vs. 51 ± 1.69) and membrane functionality (55 ± 3.2 vs. 46 ± 3.2). The Lake extender is also found to outperform the Beltsville one due to its significantly (P < 0.05) higher fertility rate (59.% vs. 47.2%). The two extenders, however, exhibit no differences in DNA fragmentation, mitochondrial activity, or hatchability rate. The Beltsville extender showed to be superior to the Lake one due to its significantly greater reactive oxygen species percentage (ROS; 45.9 ±.3.2 vs. 28. ± 3.2) and apoptosis (29 ± 2.3 vs. 27 ± 2.3). It may be concluded that the Lake extender is capable of improving the cellular and epigenetic parameters of rooster sperms during cryopreservation due to the crucial roles it plays in the protection of sperms against cryo-damages.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

CypD is regulated by its acetylation/deacetylation state that depends on Sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) mitochondrial deacetylase. Since obesity and metabolic syndrome decrease SIRT3 activity and expression, we tested the hypothesis that CypD hyperacetylation promotes mitochondrial dysfunction under this pathophysiological state, which is associated with ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.Myocardial tissue samples from patients with left ventricular heart failure, with either obesity or normal weight, were processed for the expression of SIRT3 and acetylation profile by Western Blot (WB). In addition, a rat model of obesity and metabolic syndrome induced by 30% (w/v) of sucrose was conducted. The WB analysis was used to determine the levels of mitochondrial expression of SIRT3, Adenine Nucleotide Translocator (ANT), CypD and the acetylation profile, as well as immunoprecipitation to establish the acetylation levels of CypD. Mitochondrial function was assessed by oxygen consumption analysis and maximum Ca retention capacity. Oxidative stress was assessed by aconitase activity, protein carbonyl and thiol groups content.SIRT3 expression in the biopsies of the failing human hearts showed a 46% decrease in the expression levels of obese patients in comparison to the non-obese patients (p=0.0219). Remarkably, body mass index was associated with protein acetylation (0.627; p = 0.035), suggesting that the acetylation profiles of the failing hearts of obese patients are partly mediated by a reduction in SIRT3, which is also associated with higher BNP levels, indicating a more severe ventricular dysfunction (-0.636; p = 0.043). Accordingly, obese rats demonstrated a SIRT3 mitochondrial expression decrease of 22% concomitantly with a hyperacetylated mitochondrial profile, including CypD. Cardiac  from obese animals were 2.-fold more prone to mPTP opening than the controls.Our results indicate that obesity reduces SIRT3 expression and that CypD hyperacetylation increases mPTP opening, suggesting that the activation of SIRT3 might be a potential target to decrease ventricular dysfunction and slow the progression of heart failure.© Copyright by the Author(s).

However, whether 10-HDA can protect against LPS-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage is largely unexplored. In this study, we first observed that 10-HDA decreased BBB permeability in LPS-stimulated C57BL/6 mice by Evan's blue (EB) dye. Immunostaining and Western blot results showed that 10-HDA alleviated BBB dysfunction by inhibiting the degradation of tight junction proteins (occludin, claudin- and ZO-1). In LPS-stimulated human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), 10-HDA decreased the expression of chemokines (CCL-2 and CCL-3), adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1), reactive oxygen species, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and increased the expression of tight junction proteins. Interestingly, LC-MS/MS analysis showed that 10-HDA pretreatment upregulated the expression of -associated proteins, which may reflect the mechanism underlying the regulatory effect of 10-HDA on reactive oxygen species. We further illustrated that 10-HDA promoted the activation of the AMPK pathway and the downstream PI3K/AKT pathway. Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) and LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) markedly reversed the alleviating effect of 10-HDA on the expression of tight junction proteins, indicating that 10-HDA inhibited LPS-induced BBB dysfunction by triggering the activation of the AMPK/PI3K/AKT pathway. Collectively, these data reveal that 10-HDA may be an interesting candidate for clinical evaluation in the treatment of diseases related to BBB damage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In skeletal muscle, 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate produced by valine promotes skeletal muscle fatty acid uptake, resulting in the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipids in skeletal muscle, causing skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In the liver, branched-chain α-keto acids decompose in large amounts, promote hepatic gluconeogenesis, and lead to the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, which damages the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, resulting in the accumulation of incomplete oxidation products, oxidative stress in , and hepatic insulin resistance. In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino acid catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino acid transaminase, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino acids, thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino acids in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver, and inducing insulin resistance. However, branched-chain amino acids, as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce insulin resistance. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino acids, alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino acid catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino acids catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric acid, increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric acid concentration, improving insulin resistance. This article reveals the mechanism of BCAA-induced insulin resistance and the relationship between exercise and BCAAs metabolism, adds a guarantee for the use of BCAAs, and provides a new explanation for the occurrence of diabetes and how exercise improves diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31468422>Taurine Prevented Hypoxia Induced Chicken Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis Through the Inhibition of Mitochondrial Pathway Activated by Calpain-1.</a></h1><p>Objective To determine whether taurine has protective effects on chicken myocardial apoptosis induced by hypoxic condition through inhibiting calpain-1 derived mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Methods Chicken primary embryonic myocardial cells were isolated and cultured at 37 °C under a % CO atmosphere. Firstly the optimum concentration of taurine or PD150606 was chosen by detecting the cell viability. Chicken cardiomyocytes were cultured in 95% N-% CO atmosphere for 12 h to produce hypoxic conditions. Before hypoxic treatment, 10 mM taurine and 10 uM PD150606 (a specific calpains inhibitor) were added separately or together. The cell apoptosis was detected by acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) double staining. Western blotting was used to determine the protein expressions of calpain-1, cytochrome c, Bcl-2, procaspase-9 and procaspase-3 in the cardiomyocytes. Results Taurine administration effectively attenuated the myocardial apoptosis under hypoxic condition, reduced the calpain-1 protein level. In addition, pre-treated taurine could up-regulate the protein expressions of Bcl-2 and procaspase-3 in hypoxic myocardial cells, down-regulate protein expression levels of cytochrome c and procaspase-9. Moreover, taurine exhibited same inhibition effect as PD150606 on the cell apoptosis and proteins express under hypoxic condition. Conclusions Taurine could attenuate the chicken cardiomyocyte apoptosis impaired by hypoxia through inhibiting calpian-1-derived mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in vitro.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521745>The -targeted antioxidant MitoQ inhibits memory loss, neuropathology, and extends lifespan in aged 3xTg-AD mice.</a></h1><p>Oxidative stress, likely stemming from dysfunctional , occurs before major cognitive deficits and neuropathologies become apparent in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and in mouse models of the disease. We previously reported that treating 2- to 7-month-old 3xTg-AD mice with the -targeted antioxidant MitoQ (mitoquinone mesylate: [10-(4,-Dimethoxy-2-methyl-3,6-dioxo-1,4-cyclohexadien-1-yl)decyl](triphenyl)phosphonium methanesulfonate), a period when AD-like pathologies first manifest in them, prevents AD-like symptoms from developing. To elucidate further a role for -derived oxidative stress in AD progression, we examined the ability of MitoQ to inhibit AD-like pathologies in these mice at an age in which cognitive and neuropathological symptoms have fully developed. 3xTg-AD female mice received MitoQ in their drinking water for five months beginning at twelve months after birth. Untreated 18-month-old 3xTg-AD mice exhibited significant learning deficits and extensive AD-like neuropathologies. MitoQ-treated mice showed improved memory retention compared to untreated 3xTg-AD mice as well as reduced brain oxidative stress, synapse loss, astrogliosis, microglial cell proliferation, Aβ accumulation, caspase activation, and tau hyperphosphorylation. Additionally, MitoQ treatment significantly increased the abbreviated lifespan of the 3xTg-AD mice. These findings support a role for the involvement of -derived oxidative stress in the etiology of AD and suggest that -targeted antioxidants may lessen symptoms in AD patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It is now evident that  are involved in the malignant transformation, cell proliferation, aggression and metastatic behavior of prostate cancer (PC). Recent comprehensive analysis of the mitochondrial oncobioenergetic (MOB) profile of PC cells using microplate-based high resolution respirometry has clearly demonstrated that characteristic MOB alterations occur at different stages of PC development. Additionally, studies have reported that modification of the MOB profile significantly inhibits the growth of malignant cells. This observation suggests that dynamic alterations in the MOB function are a critical component in the development of malignant disease of the prostate. Therefore, quantification of MOB function may be a good marker for the prediction of tumor stage. Future studies may develop novel approaches to measure oncobioenergetics of tumors with minimal invasive procedures effectively in men to determine the general prostate health and tumor staging, and to predict whether a tumor will proceed to malignancy in patients. Additionally, since PC is a slow growing tumor, modulating the MOB profile at specific stages of tumor development may be a novel approach to treat or prevent PC.Copyright: © Vayalil et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537245>[FGF21 inhibits lipid accumulation and inflammation induced by palmitate in human hepatocytes via SIRT1 pathway].</a></h1><p>Objective To investigate the effect of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) on the lipid accumulation and inflammation induced by palmitate treatment in L02 hepatocytes and the underlying mechanism. Methods L02 cells were infected with lentivirus expressing SIRT1 shRNA to knockdown SIRT1 expression. Wild-type and SIRT1-knockdown L02 cells were treated with 250 mol/L palmitate for  days, and then administrated with 1 g/ml FGF21 for 72 hours. Triglycerides in the cells were detected with the infinity triglycerides reagent. Malondialdehyde (MDA) in the cells was assessed by MDA detection assay. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels in supernatant were measured by ELISA. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were tested by the specific Amplex red ROS detection assay kit from Thermo Fisher Company. The gene expression of SIRT1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and catalase (CAT) were measured by real-time quantitative PCR. The protein levels of SIRT1, PGC1α, SOD2 and CAT were detected by Western blot analysis. Mitochondrial membrane potentials were detected by the JC-1staining kit. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was detected with the Seahorse XF Mito stress test kit. Results Palmitate increased the triglycerides level, induced the oxidative stress in both the cells and the , decreased the gene expression and protein levels of SIRT1, PGC1α, SOD2 and CAT, increased the levels of TNF-α and IL-6, decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential, and impaired the mitochondrial function. FGF21 treatment could attenuate all of these effects caused by palmitate, while SIRT1 knockdown blocked most of the FGF21 effects on the L02 hepatocytes. Conclusion FGF21 activates SIRT1 pathway and inhibites the lipid accumulation, improves the mitochondrial function, and decreases the oxidative stress as well as inflammation in palmitate-treated L02 cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667435>Placental extract suppresses cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in an angiotensin II-induced cachexia model in mice.</a></h1><p>Cachexia is an intractable metabolic disorder that causes extreme weight loss. It is a symptom of many chronic diseases, including cancer, liver failure, congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease, and there is as yet no effective treatment. While the mechanisms underlying cachexia are complex, it is often accompanied by elevated angiotensin II (Ang II). Human placental extract (HPE) is a source of numerous biologically active molecules and has been used clinically to treat chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and other chronic diseases. Here, we investigated the effects of HPE in an Ang II-induced cachexia model in mice. HPE treatment preserved both fat mass and lean body mass and suppressed weight loss in the cachexia model, though food intake was unaffected. Ang II infusion also caused cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. HPE suppressed these effects as well as Ang II-induced cardiac expression of genes related to heart failure and cardiac remodeling. HPE also reversed Ang II-induced downregulation of -related molecules and suppressed cardiac inflammation and oxidative stress. HPE administration may thus be an effective approach to the treatment of cachexia, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564190>2,4-Dihydroxy-3'-methoxy-4'-ethoxychalcone suppresses cell proliferation and induces apoptosis of multiple myeloma  the PI3K/akt/mTOR signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>  Kom. (Fabaceae), a commonly used folk medicine, has been found to possess antitumor effects. However, the antiproliferative effect of 2,4-dihydroxy-3'-methoxy-4'-ethoxychalcone (DMEC) derived from  against multiple myeloma (MM) has never been investigated.  This study systematically evaluates the antiproliferative effect of DMEC against MM cells.  The antiproliferative effect of DMEC (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 μM) on MM cells lines, including RPMI8226, MM.1S, and U266, was examined using Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay after 24 h incubation. The proapoptotic effect of DMEC (20 μM) was determined using fluorescent microscope and flow cytometer, and its possible underlying mechanisms were further studied by using western blotting analysis.  The half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC) of DMEC on RPMI8226, MM.1S, and U266 cells were calculated as 25.97, 18.36, and 15.02 μM, respectively. The inhibitory effect of DMEC on MM cells was related to -mediated apoptosis  upregulation of the cleaved-caspase-3 (C-3), cleaved-caspase-9 (C-9), Bad, and cytochrome C (Cyto C), but downregulation of the Bcl-2 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). Furthermore, DMEC (, 10, and 20 μM) reduced the expression of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated (p)-protein kinase B (Akt), and p-mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), which were further evidenced by pretreatment with IGF-1, a PI3K activator.  Collectively, our results indicate that the DMEC could be treated as a new candidate for treatment of multiple myeloma in the future.

A number of isothiocyanates have been demonstrated to exhibit anticancer effects; however, antitumor properties of propyl isothiocyanate (PITC) have not been evaluated previously. In this study, the possible effects of PITC on gastric cancer (GC) cells were investigated, and the potential underlying mechanisms were explored. The results demonstrated that PITC inhibited cell viability of two GC cell lines and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Treatment with PITC promoted total glutathione depletion in GC cell lines, leading to reactive oxygen species accumulation and DNA damage, which activated the -dependent and p53 signaling pathways to trigger apoptosis in GC cells. The effects of PITC were reversed by N-Acetyl-L-cysteine. The results of the present study revealed the potential mechanisms of PITC on apoptosis induction in GC cells, which may be mediated by -dependent apoptosis and DNA damage.Copyright: © Huang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612296>Gold Nanoparticles Treatment Reverses Brain Damage in Alzheimer's Disease Model.</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid (A)β peptide accumulation and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. New hypotheses have suggested that AD involves neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Gold nanoparticles (AuNP) presents anti-inflammatory and antioxidant characteristics. The present study evaluated the AuNP treatment on an AD model (okadaic acid, OA). Male Wistar rats were injected intracerebroventricularly with OA (100 μg); 24 h later they were treated with 20-nm AuNP (at a dose 2. mg/kg) every 48 h for 21 days. The following groups were separated (n = 12/group): Sham, AuNP, OA, and OA + AuNP. OA increases Tau phosphorylation in the cortex and hippocampus, while AuNP treatment maintained it as normal. Spatial memory was impaired by OA, and AuNP treatment prevented this deficit. Neurotrophic factors (BDNF and NGF- β) in the cortex and hippocampus were decreased by OA. The OA and OA + AuNP groups showed increased interleukin (IL)-1 β in the hippocampus and cortex, and the AuNP group showed increased IL-1 β in the hippocampus. In both groups, S100 levels in the cortex and hippocampus were increased by OA. IL-4 was increased in OA + AuNP animals. AuNPs prevented oxidative stress (sulfhydryl and nitrite levels) in brain structures induced by OA. Moreover, OA modulated ATP synthase activity, and AuNP maintained normal brain mitochondrial function. The antioxidant capacities were reduced by OA, and AuNP restored antioxidant status (SOD, catalase activities and GSH levels) on brain. OA-induced damage on brain tissues, and long-term AuNP treatment prevented the neuroinflammation, modulation of mitochondrial function, and impaired cognition induced by AD model, showing that AuNPs may be a promising treatment for neurodisease caused by these elements.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658406>N-terminal autoprocessing and acetylation of MARTX Makes-Caterpillars Floppy-like effector is stimulated by ADP-Ribosylation Factor 1 in advance of Golgi fragmentation.</a></h1><p>Studies have successfully elucidated the mechanism of action of several effector domains that comprise the MARTX toxins of Vibrio vulnificus. However, the biochemical linkage between the cysteine proteolytic activity of Makes Caterpillars Floppy-like (MCF) effector and its cellular effects remains unknown. In this study, we identify the host cell factors that activate in vivo and in vitro MCF autoprocessing as ADP-Ribosylation Factor 1 (ARF1) and ADP-ribosylation Factor 3 (ARF3). Autoprocessing activity is enhanced when ARF1 is in its active (GTP-bound) form compared to the inactive (GDP-bound) form. Subsequent to auto-cleavage, MCF is acetylated on its exposed N-terminal glycine residue. Acetylation apparently does not dictate subcellular localization, as MCF is found localized throughout the cell. However, the cleaved form of MCF gains the ability to bind to the specialized lipid phosphatidylinositol -phosphate enriched in Golgi and other membranes necessary for endocytic trafficking, suggesting a fraction of MCF may be subcellular localized. Traditional thin-section electron microscopy, high-resolution cryoAPEX localization, and fluorescent microscopy show that MCF causes Golgi dispersal resulting in extensive vesiculation. In addition, host  are disrupted and fragmented. Mass spectrometry analysis found no reproducible modifications of ARF1 suggesting ARF1 is not post-translationally modified by MCF. Further, catalytically active MCF does not stably associate with ARF1. Our data indicate that ARF1 is a cross-kingdom activator of MCF, but also that MCF may mediate cytotoxicity by directly targeting another yet to be identified protein. This study begins to elucidate the biochemical activity of this important domain and gives insight into how it may promote disease progression.This article is protected by copyright.

ROS is increased by activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase family members and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis of . Increased ROS is detoxified by superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxiredoxins. ROS has a role as a secondary messenger in signal transduction. Cancer cells induce fluctuations of redox homeostasis by variation of ROS regulated machinery, leading to increased tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Redox-mediated mechanisms of chemoresistance include endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated autophagy, increased cell cycle progression, and increased conversion to metastasis or cancer stem-like cells.

Ubiquinol has been increasingly reported to exert antioxidant functions, in addition to its role in the cell energy-producing system of  and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The aim of this study was to assess the potential beneficial effects of QH on anti-fatigue and ergogenic functions following physiological challenge. Forty 8-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were divided into four groups ( = 10 for each group): Group 1 (vehicle control or oil only); Group 2 (1X QH dose or 102. mg/kg); Group 3 (2X QH dose or 205 mg/kg); Group 4 (6X QH dose or 615 mg/kg). Anti-fatigue activity and exercise performance were studied using the forelimb grip strength experiment and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time, and levels of serum lactate, ammonia, glucose, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatine kinase (CK), and free fatty acids (FFA) after an acute exercise challenge. The forelimb grip strength and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time of the QH-6X group were significantly higher than those of the other groups. QH supplementation dose-dependently reduced serum lactate, ammonia, and CK levels and increased the FFA concentration after acute exercise. In addition, QH increased the liver and muscle glycogen content, an important energy source during exercise. Therefore, the results suggest that QH formulation is a safe dietary supplement for amelioration of fatigue and for promoting exercise performance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605661>PGC-1α plays a pivotal role in simvastatin-induced exercise impairment in mice.</a></h1><p>Statins decrease cardiovascular complications, but can induce myopathy. Here, we explored the implication of PGC-1α in statin-associated myotoxicity.We treated PGC-1α knockout (KO), PGC-1α over-expression (OE) and wild-type mice (WT) mice orally with  mg simvastatin kg day for 3 weeks and assessed muscle function and metabolism.In WT and KO mice, but not in OE mice, simvastatin decreased grip strength, maximal running distance and vertical power assessed by ergometry. Post exercise plasma lactate concentrations were higher in WT and KO compared to OE mice. In glycolytic gastrocnemius, simvastatin decreased mitochondrial respiration, increased mitochondrial ROS production and free radical leak in WT and KO, but not in OE mice. Simvastatin increased mRNA expression of Sod1 and Sod2 in glycolytic and oxidative gastrocnemius of WT, but decreased it in KO mice.

To date, ferroptosis has been believed to be restrained only by the phospholipid hydroperoxide (PLOOH)-reducing enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and radical-trapping antioxidants (RTAs). The factors which underlie a given cell type's sensitivity to ferroptosis are, however, critical to understand the pathophysiological role of ferroptosis and how it may be exploited for cancer treatment. Although metabolic constraints and phospholipid composition contribute to ferroptosis sensitivity, no cell-autonomous mechanisms have been yet been identified that account for ferroptosis resistance. We undertook an expression cloning approach to identify genes able to complement GPX4 loss. These efforts uncovered the flavoprotein "apoptosis inducing factor -associated 2 (AIFM2)" as a previously unrecognized anti-ferroptotic gene. AIFM2, hereafter renamed "ferroptosis-suppressor-protein 1" (FSP1), initially described as a pro-apoptotic gene, confers an unprecedented protection against ferroptosis elicited by GPX4 deletion. We further demonstrate that ferroptosis suppression by FSP1 is mediated via ubiquinone (CoQ): its reduced form ubiquinol traps lipid peroxyl radicals that mediate lipid peroxidation, while FSP1 catalyses its regeneration by using NAD(P)H. Pharmacological targeting of FSP1 strongly synergizes with GPX4 inhibitors to trigger ferroptosis in a number of cancer entities. In conclusion, FSP1/CoQ/NAD(P)H exists as a stand-alone parallel system, which co-operates with GPX4 and glutathione (GSH) to suppress phospholipid peroxidation (pLPO) and ferroptosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606618>Tetracycline affects the toxicity of P25 n-TiO towards marine microalgae Chlorella sp.</a></h1><p>Pollutants such as n-TiO and tetracycline enter the marine environment through various sources starting from their production until disposal. Hence, it is vital to determine the interactive effect of one pollutant with the other when they coexist in the environment. In the present study, the effect of antibiotic - tetracycline (TC) on the toxicity of P25 n-TiO was studied with marine microalgae, Chlorella sp. The impact of TC (1 mg L) on five different concentrations of n-TiO (0.25, 0., 1, 2 and 4 mg L) under both visible and UV-A illuminations was evaluated. Effective diameter of n-TiO in ASW at 0 h increased from 690.69 ± 19.55 nm (0.25 mg L) to 1183.04 ± 37.10 nm (0.25 mg L + 1 mg L) and 971.51 ± 14.61 nm (4 mg L) to 1324.12 ± 11.59 nm (4 mg L + 1 mg L) in presence of TC. A significant increase in the toxicity of 4 mg L n-TiO upon the addition of TC (68.16 ± 0.37% under visible and 80.21 ± 0.3% under UV-A condition) was observed. No significant difference in toxicity was observed between visible and UV-A illuminations. Further the toxicity data was corroborated through the measurement of oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme activities. Independent action model showed antagonistic effect for lower concentrations of n-TiO and additive effect for higher concentrations of n-TiO when present in mixture with TC under both illuminations. For the higher mixture concentration of 4 mg L n-TiO and 1 mg L TC, the percentage TC removal was about 55.29% and 30% and the corresponding TOC removal was found to be 54.29% and 31.04% under visible and UV-A illuminations respectively. The site of ROS generation in Chlorella sp. was identified with electron transfer chain inhibitors. Both  and chloroplast acted as the site for the ROS generation in Chlorella sp. The SEM images of the algal cells upon exposure to n-TiO and mixture revealed the aggregation of cells and distortion of cell membrane.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although the loss of normal TDP-43 functions likely contributes to disease pathogenesis, the cell biological consequences of human TDP-43 depletion are not well understood. We, therefore, generated human TDP-43 knockout (KO) cells and subjected them to parallel cell biological and transcriptomic analyses. These efforts yielded three important discoveries. First, complete loss of TDP-43 resulted in widespread morphological defects related to multiple organelles, including Golgi, endosomes, lysosomes, , and the nuclear envelope. Second, we identified a new role for TDP-43 in controlling mRNA splicing of Nup188 (nuclear pore protein). Third, analysis of multiple amyotrophic lateral sclerosis causing TDP-43 mutations revealed a broad ability to support splicing of TDP-43 target genes. However, as some TDP-43 disease-causing mutants failed to fully support the regulation of specific target transcripts, our results raise the possibility of mutation-specific loss-of-function contributions to disease pathology.© 2019 Agnes et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642107>3-(3-Methoxyphenyl)-6-(3-amino-4-methoxyphenyl)-7H-[1,2,4] triazolo [3,4-b][1,3,4] thiadiazine, a novel tubulin inhibitor, evokes G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in SGC-7901 and HeLa cells.</a></h1><p>Gastric cancer and cervical cancer are two major malignant tumors that threaten human health. The novel chemotherapeutic drugs are needed urgently to treat gastric cancer and cervical cancer with high anticancer activity and metabolic stability. Previously we have reported the synthesis, characterization and identification of a novel combretastatin A-4 analog, 3-(3-methoxyphenyl)-6-(3-amino-4- methoxyphenyl) -7H-[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4] thiadiazine (XSD-7). In this study, we sought to investigate its anticancer mechanisms in a human gastric cancer cell line (SGC-7901 cells) and human cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa cells). The 3-(4,-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, -diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay showed that XSD-7 induced cytotoxicity in SGC-7901 and HeLa cells with inhibitory concentration 50 values of 0.11 ± 0.03 and 0.12 ± 0.05 µM, respectively. Immunofluorescence studies proved that XSD-7 inhibited microtubule polymerization during cell division in SGC-7901 and HeLa cells. Then, these cells were arrested at G2/M cell cycle and subsequently progressed into apoptosis. In further study, mitochondrial membrane potential analysis and Western blot analysis demonstrated that XSD-7 treatment-induced SGC-7901 cell apoptosis via both the -mediated pathway and the death receptor-mediated pathway. In contrast, XSD-7 induced apoptosis in HeLa cells mainly via the -mediated pathway. Hence, our data indicate that XSD-7 exerted antiproliferative activity by disrupting microtubule dynamics, leading to cell cycle arrest, and eventually inducing cell apoptosis. XSD-7 with novel structure has the potential to be developed for therapeutic treatment of gastric cancer and cervical cancer.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575774>New Mitochondrial Targets in Fungal Pathogens.</a></h1><p>In eukaryotic cells,  are responsible for the synthesis of ATP using power generated by the electron transport chain (ETC).

Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated. Nrf2 and HO-1 expression were detected using Western blotting. Mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial superoxide production were observed using confocal microscope. Mitochondrial respiration function was measured using Seahorse bioanalyzer.(1) The cell viability decreased, LDH release and apoptosis increased in LPS- challenged H9c2 cells. DMF pretreatment brought a higher cell viability, and a lower LDH leakage and apoptosis than those of LPS group (P < 0.01). (2) DMF pretreatment resulted in an increased Nrf2 and HO-1 expression, and enhanced nuclear Nrf2 level in LPS-challenged cells (P < 0.01). (3) Nrf2-siRNA could inhibit DMF-induced enhancement of HO-1 expression and cell viability, and partly abolish DMF-induced reduction of LDH leakage and apoptosis. (4) ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 could not only prevent the DMF-induced enhancement of nuclear Nrf2 and HO-1, but also inhibit DMF-induced increase in cell viability. () Compared with LPS-challenged cells, DMF pretreatment caused a lower production of mitochondrial superoxide and a higher mitochondrial membrane potential, which could be abolished by Nrf2-siRNA. (6) DMF could attenuate LPS-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and improve mitochondrial respiration function by enhancement of the oxygen consumption rate of basal respiration and ATP production in LPS-challenged cells (P < 0.01).DMF protects cardiomyocytes against LPS-induced damage.

As the thermal sensitivity of bioenergetic pathways depends on the structural and kinetic properties of its component enzymes, optimization of their  function to different thermal niches is expected to have occurred through selection. In the present study, we sought to characterize mitochondrial phenotypic adjustments to thermal niches in eight ray-finned fish species occupying a wide range of thermal habitats by comparing the activities of key mitochondrial enzymes in their hearts. We measured the activity of four enzymes that control substrate entrance into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle: pyruvate kinase (PK), pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc), carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT), and hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD). We also assayed enzymes of the electron transport system (ETS): complexes I, II, I + III, and IV. Enzymes were assayed at five temperatures (, 10, 15, 20, and 25°C). Our results showed that the activity of CPT, a gatekeeper of the fatty acid pathway, was higher in the cold-water fish than in the warmer-adapted fish relative to the ETS (complexes I and III) when measured close to the species optimal temperatures. The activity of HOAD showed a similar pattern relative to CI + III and thermal environment. By contrast, PDHc and PK did not show the similar patterns with respect to CI + III and temperature. Cold-adapted species had high CIV activities compared to those of upstream complexes (I, II, I + III) whereas the converse was true for warm-adapted species. Our findings reveal a significant variability of heart mitochondrial organization among species that can be linked to temperature adaptation. Cold-adapted fish do not appear to compensate for PDHc activity but likely adjust fatty acids oxidation through higher activities of CPT and HOAD relative to complexes I + III.Copyright © 2019 Hunter-Manseau, Desrosiers, Le François, Dufresne, Detrich, Nozais and Blier.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571658>Transfer of  from mesenchymal stem cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells attenuates hypoxia-ischemia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in PC12 cells.</a></h1><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons has been implicated in hypoxia-ischemia-induced brain injury. Although mesenchymal stem cell therapy has emerged as a novel treatment for this pathology, the mechanisms are not fully understood. To address this issue, we first co-cultured 1. × 10 PC12 cells with mesenchymal stem cells that were derived from induced pluripotent stem cells at a ratio of 1:1, and then intervened with cobalt chloride (CoCl) for 24 hours. Reactive oxygen species in PC12 cells was measured by Mito-sox. Mitochondrial membrane potential (?Ψm) in PC12 cells was determined by JC-1 staining. Apoptosis of PC12 cells was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidal transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling staining. Mitochondrial morphology in PC12 cells was examined by transmission electron microscopy. Transfer of  from the mesenchymal stem cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells to damaged PC12 cells was measured by flow cytometry. Mesenchymal stem cells were induced from pluripotent stem cells by lentivirus infection containing green fluorescent protein in . Then they were co-cultured with PC12 cells in Transwell chambers and treated with CoCl for 24 hours to detect adenosine triphosphate level in PC12 cells. CoCl-induced PC12 cell damage was dose-dependent. Co-culture with mesenchymal stem cells significantly reduced apoptosis and restored ?Ψm in the injured PC12 cells under CoCl challenge. Co-culture with mesenchymal stem cells ameliorated mitochondrial swelling, the disappearance of cristae, and chromatin margination in the injured PC12 cells. After direct co-culture, mitochondrial transfer from the mesenchymal stem cells stem cells to PC12 cells was detected via formed tunneling nanotubes between these two types of cells. The transfer efficiency was greatly enhanced in the presence of CoCl. More importantly, inhibition of tunneling nanotubes partially abrogated the beneficial effects of mesenchymal stem cells on CoCl-induced PC12 cell injury. Mesenchymal stem cells reduced CoCl-induced PC12 cell injury and these effects were in part due to efficacious mitochondrial transfer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31528705>HectH9 hijacks glucose metabolism to fuel tumor growth.</a></h1><p>Our study uncovered that HectH9 drives glycolysis and tumor development by K63-linked ubiquitination of Hexokinase 2 (HK2).

Beyond this mitochondrial function, several Bcl-2 family members have emerged as critical modulators of intracellular Ca homeostasis and dynamics, showing proapoptotic and antiapoptotic functions. Bcl-2 family proteins specifically target several intracellular Ca-transport systems, including organellar Ca channels: inositol 1,4,-trisphosphate receptors (IPRs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs), Ca-release channels mediating Ca flux from the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs), which mediate Ca flux across the mitochondrial outer membrane into the . Although the formation of protein complexes between Bcl-2 proteins and these channels has been extensively studied, a major advance during recent years has been elucidating the complex interaction of Bcl-2 proteins with IPRs. Distinct interaction sites for different Bcl-2 family members were identified in the primary structure of IPRs. The unique molecular profiles of these Bcl-2 proteins may account for their distinct functional outcomes when bound to IPRs. Furthermore, Bcl-2 inhibitors used in cancer therapy may affect IPR function as part of their proapoptotic effect and/or as an adverse effect in healthy cells.Copyright © 2019 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629663>Left ventricular noncompaction - Risk stratification and genetic consideration.</a></h1><p>Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a cardiomyopathy characterized by two layered structures composed of prominent trabecular meshwork and deep intertrabecular recesses. LVNC was thought to be rare; however, heightened awareness has resulted in an increased detection of the morphological features of LVNC in routine clinical practice especially in the adult population. Although LVNC was classified as an independent primary cardiomyopathy of genetic origin by the American Heart Association in 2006, its definition, diagnostic criteria and clinical implications are still being debated. Clinical manifestations are highly variable, even in the same family, ranging from no symptoms to disabling congestive heart failure, life-threatening arrhythmias, systemic thromboemboli, and sudden cardiac death. Among phenotypic subtypes of LVNC, children with isolated LVNC with normal cardiac function had the best outcomes: children with LVNC and dilated cardiomyopathy had the worst outcomes. Myocardial dysfunction or ventricular arrhythmias are predictors of mortality in adults with LVNC. LVNC, like other forms of inherited cardiomyopathy, is genetically heterogeneous and can be inherited as an autosomal dominant or X-linked recessive disorder. It has been linked to mutations in many genes, including ZASP, TAZ/G4., and those encoding sarcomeric, Z-disc, cytoskeleton proteins, and . Disturbance of the NOTCH signaling pathway has been reported to be part of genetic pathway for LVNC as well. Although there are an increasing number of reports, genotype-phenotype correlations have been challenging and investigations are ongoing. Patients with mutations are more likely to have major adverse cardiovascular events, further, LV systolic dysfunction in mutation carriers makes them at high risk for cardiac events. Treatments focus on improvement in cardiac function and reduction of mechanical stress in patients with systolic dysfunction and on treatment of arrhythmia and implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for prevention of sudden death. Given that 20-40% of cases may be familial, family screening is recommended.Copyright © 2019 Japanese College of Cardiology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Mauriac syndrome (MS) is a glycogenic hepatopathy, initially described in 1930, characterized by growth failure, delayed puberty, cushingoid appearance, hepatomegaly with abnormal liver enzymes, and hypercholesterolemia. HG is a condition with good prognosis and fast resolution after adequate glycemic control (although it has potential for relapse), with no case of evolution to end-stage liver disease described.We describe a 26-year-old female, with T1DM complicated by severe retinopathy. The patient maintained poor glycemic control since childhood, presenting glycated hemoglobin persistently higher than 10% and recurrent episodes of ketoacidosis. In adolescence, she developed hepatomegaly and fluctuating elevation of aminotransferases and triglycerides. A small, nonrepresentative hepatic biopsy suggested macrovacuolar steatosis and mild fibrosis. After 15 years of diabetes, the patient was referred for gastroenterology clinic due to chronic diarrhea and exuberant hepatomegaly. Laboratory showed persistent elevation of aminotransferases and triglycerides. Bilirubin, iron metabolism, and coagulation were normal; viral serologies and autoimmune study were negative. Upper endoscopy, ileocolonoscopy, and enteroscopy presented no lesions. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging displayed massive hepatomegaly. Liver biopsy was repeated showing marked nuclear glycogenization, mild steatosis, and no fibrosis; electron microscopy revealed very large deposits of glycogen and pleomorphic  with an unusually dense matrix, described for the first time in this entity.

The open reading frame (ORF) of OcicCuZnSOD2 and OcMnSOD are 462 and 672 bp encoding 153 and 223 amino acids, respectively. OcicCuZnSOD2 contains two signature sequences, one potential N-glycosylation site, and seven copper/zinc binding sites. OcMnSOD includes a  targeting sequence of 7 amino acids at N-terminal, one signature sequence, two N-glycosylation sites, and four manganese binding sites. The secondary structure and homology model of OcicCuZnSOD2 include nine β sheets, two Greek-key motifs, and one electrostatic loop. OcMnSOD contains nine α-helices and three β-sheets. Phylogenetic analysis shows that OcMnSOD is evolutionarily conserved while OcicCuZnSOD2 may be gene duplication and is paralogous to OcicCuZnSOD1. OcMnSOD expressed widely in all tissues and developmental stages. OcicCuZnSOD2 showed testis-specific expression and expressed highest in the 5th-instar nymph and the adult. The optimum temperatures and pH values of the recombinant OcicCuZnSOD2 and OcMnSOD were 40 °C and 8.0. They were stable at 25-55 °C and at pH .0-12.0 and pH 6.0-12.0, respectively. The activity and mRNA expression of each OcSOD were assayed after chlorpyrifos treatments. Total SOD and CuZnSOD activities first increased then declined under chlorpyrifos stress. Chlorpyrifos induced the mRNA expression and activity of OcMnSOD as a dose-dependent manner and inhibited OcicCuZnSOD2 transcription. The role of each OcSOD gene in chlorpyrifos stress was investigated using RNAi and disc diffusion assay with Escherichia coli overexpressing OcSOD proteins. Silencing of OcMnSOD significantly increased ROS content in chlorpyrifos-exposed grasshoppers. Disc diffusion assay showed that the plates with E. coli overexpressing OcMnSOD had the smaller inhibition zones around the chlorpyrifos-soaked filter discs. These results implied that OcMnSOD played a significant role in defense chlorpyrifos-induced oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Our previous work revealed that diverse upstream events correlated with altered mitochondrial proteome in human muscle biopsies. However, several proteins showed relatively unchanged expression suggesting that post-translational modifications, mainly protein phosphorylation could influence their activity and regulate mitochondrial processes. We conducted mitochondrial phosphoprotein profiling, by proteomics approach, of healthy human skeletal muscle (n = 10) and three muscle diseases (n = 10 each): Dysferlinopathy, Polymyositis and Distal Myopathy with Rimmed Vacuoles. Healthy human muscle mitochondrial proteins displayed 253 phosphorylation sites (phosphosites), which contributed to metabolic and redox processes and mitochondrial organization etc. Electron transport chain complexes accounted for 84 phosphosites. Muscle pathologies displayed 33 hyperphosphorylated and 14 hypophorphorylated sites with only  common proteins, indicating varied phosphorylation profile across muscle pathologies. Molecular modelling revealed altered local structure in the phosphorylated sites of Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1 and complex V subunit ATP5B1. Molecular dynamics simulations in complex I subunits NDUFV1, NDUFS1 and NDUFV2 revealed that phosphorylation induced structural alterations thereby influencing electron transfer and potentially altering enzyme activity. We propose that altered phosphorylation at specific sites could regulate mitochondrial protein function in the skeletal muscle during physiological and pathological processes.Copyright © 2019.

Using assays to evaluate cell proliferation, apoptosis, and gene expression, we investigated the efficacy of MSCs expressing tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis inducing ligand (MSC-TRAIL) to target and destroy CD133+ (prominin-1 positive) NSCLC-derived CSCs. Characterization of TRAIL death receptor  (DR5) revealed that it was highly expressed in the CD133+ CSCs of both H460 and H2170 cell lines. The human MSC-TRAIL generated in the study maintained its multipotent characteristics, and caused significant tumor cell inhibition in NSCLC-derived CSCs in a co-culture.

Boosted mitochondrial metabolism might be able to protect against metabolic stress and prevent metabolic disorders. Here we show that NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDU)-FAB1, also known as mitochondrial acyl carrier protein, acts as a novel enhancer of mitochondrial metabolism and protects against obesity and insulin resistance. Mechanistically, NDUFAB1 coordinately enhances lipoylation and activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase mediated by the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis pathway and increases the assembly of respiratory complexes and supercomplexes. Skeletal muscle-specific ablation of NDUFAB1 causes systemic disruption of glucose homeostasis and defective insulin signaling, leading to growth arrest and early death within  postnatal days. In contrast, NDUFAB1 overexpression effectively protects mice against obesity and insulin resistance when the animals are challenged with a high-fat diet.

Their development proposes structure optimization in respect of availability and activity towards target cells and organelles. Selection of 1 or its precursor betulonic acid 2 and the optimal linker is of particular importance for drug candidate identification among the TPP-triterpenoid conjugates.In this study new C-28-TPP conjugated derivatives of 1 and 2 with the alkyl/alkoxyalkyl linkers of variable length were synthesized and compared regarding their anticancer, antibacterial, and -targeted effects.The TPP conjugates of 1 and 2 [6a-f, 7a-f] were synthesized by the reaction of halogenalkyl esters [3a-f, 4a-f, ] with triphenylphosphine in acetonitrile upon heating.

The conjugates were up to 10-17 times more active against MCF-7 (IC50 = 0.17µM, 72h, 6c) and PC-3 (IC50 = 0.14µM, 72h, 6a) cancer cells than for human skin fibroblasts. Enhanced antibacterial (bactericidal) activity of the TPP-triterpenoid conjugates with MIC for Gram-positive bacteria as low as 2µM (6a, 7a) was for the first time revealed. The conjugates were found to effectively inhibit oxidation of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin probe in cytosol, decrease transmembrane potential and increase superoxide radical level in .Relationships between the effects and structure of the TPP-triterpenoid conjugates were evaluated and are discussed. Based on the results, 6a can be selected for further preclinical investigation as a potential anticancer compound.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665641>Maternal Lipid Metabolism Directs Fetal Liver Programming following Nutrient Stress.</a></h1><p>The extreme metabolic demands of pregnancy require coordinated metabolic adaptations between mother and fetus to balance fetal growth and maternal health with nutrient availability. To determine maternal and fetal contributions to metabolic flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or lipid metabolism were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal liver transcriptional program marked by upregulation of lipid- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal lipid metabolism alters circulating lipid metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves metabolic deficits in fetal carbohydrate metabolism by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal liver transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient metabolism in mediating maternal-fetal metabolic communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

The identification of human FA blood biomarkers related to disease severity and neuro-pathomechanism could support clinical trials of drug efficacy. To try to identify human biomarkers of neuro-pathomechanistic relevance, we compared the overlapping gene expression changes of primary blood and skin cells of FA patients with changes in the Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) of the KIKO FA mouse model. As DRG is the primary site of neurodegeneration in FA, our goal was to identify which changes in blood and skin of FA patients provide a 'window' into the FA neuropathomechanism inside the nervous system. In addition, gene expression in frataxin-deficient neuroglial cells and FA mouse hearts were compared for a total of  data sets. The overlap of these changes strongly supports mitochondrial changes, apoptosis and alterations of selenium metabolism. Consistent biomarkers were observed, including three genes of mitochondrial stress (MTIF2, ENO2), apoptosis (DDIT3/CHOP), oxidative stress (PREX1), and selenometabolism (SEPW1). These results prompted our investigation of the GPX1 activity as a marker of selenium and oxidative stress, in which we observed a significant change in FA patients. We believe these lead biomarkers that could be assayed in FA patient blood as indicators of disease severity and progression, and also support the involvement of , apoptosis and selenium in the neurodegenerative process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31516159>Tracking CO release in cells via the luminescence of donor molecules and/or their by-products.</a></h1><p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a bioactive signalling molecule that is produced endogenously via the breakdown of heme. Beneficial health effects associated with the delivery of CO gas have spurred the development of CO-releasing molecules (CORMs) that can be used to provide specific amounts of the gas. In addition to their potential use as therapeutics, CORMs are needed to provide insight into the biological targets of CO. In this regard, light-activated CO-releasing molecules (photoCORMs), are valuable for examining the effects of localized CO release. Herein we examine luminescent CORMs and photoCORMs that have been reported for tracking CO delivery in cells. A variety of motifs are available that exhibit differing luminescence properties and cover a wide range of wavelengths. Trackable CO donors have been successfully applied to targeting CO delivery to , thus demonstrating the feasibility of using such molecules in detailed investigations of the biological roles of CO.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31539151>Downregulation of lncRNA MEG3 attenuates high glucose-induced cardiomyocytes injury by inhibiting -mediated apoptosis pathway.</a></h1><p>The aim of the present work was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in cardiomyocytes injury and apoptosis induced by high glucose (HG) in vitro.HG-induced rats' cardiomyocytes with si-MEG3 transfection were constructed. Cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level were examined using the MTT (3-(4,-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) and LDH assay kits, respectively. Cardiomyocytes apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. The expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3 proteins were determined by Western blot. The expression of lncRNA MEG3 was measured by Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).Our results indicated that the expression of MEG3 was significantly upregulated in HG-treated cardiomyocytes. The downregulation of MEG3 could attenuate cardiomyocytes injury and apoptosis by decreasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3 expression.The downregulation of MEG3 could attenuate cardiomyocytes injury and apoptosis induced by HG. The molecular mechanism was associated with the inhibition of the -mediated apoptosis pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535025>Mitochondrial protein import is regulated by p17/PERMIT to mediate lipid metabolism and cellular stress.</a></h1><p>How lipid metabolism is regulated at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) for transducing stress signaling remains largely unknown. We show here that this process is controlled by trafficking of ceramide synthase 1 (CerS1) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the OMM by a previously uncharacterized p17, which is now renamed protein that mediates ER- trafficking (PERMIT). Data revealed that p17/PERMIT associates with newly translated CerS1 on the ER surface to mediate its trafficking to the OMM. Cellular stress induces Drp1 nitrosylation/activation, releasing p17/PERMIT to retrieve CerS1 for its OMM trafficking, resulting in mitochondrial ceramide generation, mitophagy and cell death. In vivo, CRISPR-Cas9-dependent genetic ablation of p17/PERMIT prevents acute stress-mediated CerS1 trafficking to OMM, attenuating mitophagy in p17/PERMIT mice, compared to controls, in various metabolically active tissues, including brain, muscle, and pancreas. Thus, these data have implications in diseases associated with accumulation of damaged  such as cancer and/or neurodegeneration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545918>NSAID-induced injury of gastric epithelial cells is reversible. Roles of , AMP kinase, NGF and PGE.</a></h1><p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac (DFN) and indomethacin (INDO) are extensively used worldwide. Their main side effects are injury of gastrointestinal tract - erosions, ulcers and bleeding. Since gastric epithelial cells (GEPCs) are crucial for mucosal defense and are the major target of injury, we examined the extent to which DFN- and INDO- induced GEPC injury can be reversed by nerve growth factor (NGF), 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E (dmPGE), and -aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) - the pharmacological activator of the metabolic sensor, AMP kinase (AMPK).Cultured rat gastric mucosal epithelial cells (RGM1) were treated with PBS (control), NGF, dmPGE, AICAR and/or NSAID - DFN or INDO for 1-4 hours. We examined: 1) cell injury; 2) cell death/survival; 3) mitochondrial membrane potential; and 4) phosphorylation of AMPK.DFN and INDO treatment of RGM1 cells for 2 hours decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and cell viability. NGF post-treatment (initiated 1 or 2 hours after DFN or INDO) reversed the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and cell injury caused by DFN and INDO, and increased cell viability vs. cells treated for 4 hours with NSAID alone. Pre-treatment with dmPGE and AICAR protected these cells from DFN- and INDO- induced injury while dmPGE and AICAR post-treatment (initiated 1 hour after NSAID treatment) reversed cell injury, and significantly increased cell viability and rescued the cells from NSAID-induced mitochondrial membrane potential reduction.DFN and INDO induce extensive mitochondrial injury and GEPC death, which can be significantly reversed by NGF, dmPGE and AICAR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664760>Protein Phase Separation and Determinants of in cell Crystallization.</a></h1><p>Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) in cells is known as a complex physicochemical process causing the formation of membrane-less organelles (MLOs). Cells have well-defined different membrane-surrounded organelles like , endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, peroxisomes, etc., however, on demand they can create membrane-less organelles as stress granules, nucleoli and P bodies to cover vital functions and regulatory activities. However, the mechanism of intracellular molecule assembly into functional compartments within a living cell remains till now not fully understood. (Soft Matter 2019, 15 (6):1135-1154). In vitro and in vivo investigations unveiled that MLOs emerge after preceding liquid-liquid, liquid-gel, liquid-semi-crystalline, or liquid-crystalline phase separations. Liquid-liquid and liquid-gel MLOs form the majority of cellular phase separation events, while the occurrence of micro-sized crystals in cells was only rarely observed, however can be considered as a result of a preceding protein phase separation event. In vivo, also known and termed as in cellulo crystals, are reported since 1853 (Botanische Zeitung, 13, 881-8 821 855; CR Mem. Soc. Biol. , 450-454, 1853). In some cases, they have been linked to vital cellular functions, such as storage and detoxification. However, the occurrence of in cellulo crystals is also associated to diseases like cataract, hemoglobin C diseases etc. (Biology Chemistry De Gruyter 2018, 399 (7):751-752). Therefore, better knowledge about the involved molecular processes will support drug discovery investigations to cure diseases related to in cellulo crystallization.

To understand comprehensive metabolic disturbances in this model, both cell lysates and culture supernatants were subjected to metabolomic analysis. As expected from the fact that MPP inhibits mitochondrial complex I, a metabolic shift from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis was indicated by an increase in extracellular lactic acid and a parallel depletion of pyruvic acid. In cell lysates, the metabolic shift was supported by consistent decreases in TCA cycle intermediates. Metabolomic analysis also revealed aberrant choline metabolism. Choline in the culture supernatant was elevated 8.- and 17-fold by 30 and 300 μM MPP exposure, respectively; therefore, extracellular choline might be a metabolic biomarker for Parkinson's disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we examined the thoracic aorta, including perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) of the IL-18 knockout (KO) mice in terms of functional and histological aspects.　IL-18KO mice exhibited significantly higher blood pressure compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Echocardiographic examination showed a thickened vascular wall and narrowed vascular diameter of the abdominal aorta. Examination by the Magnus test demonstrated dysfunction of endothelial cells (EC) in the IL-18KO thoracic aorta and impairment of the anti-contractile function of IL-18KO PVAT. Histological examination showed no inflammatory lesions in the aorta, but indicated progressive fibrosis in the vessel, conversion of PVAT from brown adipose tissue-like features to white adipose tissue-like features, and heterogeneous localizations of claudin  in the PVAT of IL-18KO mice. Electron microscopic observation revealed several deformed  in the EC and PVAT, and many vacuoles in the EC of the IL-18KO aorta. ATP productivity and activity of complex IV were decreased in the  of IL-18KO aorta, and production of reactive oxygen species was augmented. Western blot analysis revealed that a decreased expression of MnSOD, while that of UCP1 and LAMP 1/2 was increased in  of IL-18KO PVAT. Moreover, cathepsin D activity was decreased in IL-18KO PVAT. Thus, the IL-18KO thoracic aorta had defects in physiological functions related to histological　alterations, which might have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in IL-18KO mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31473688>Successful treatment of infantile-onset ACAD9-related cardiomyopathy with a combination of sodium pyruvate, beta-blocker, and coenzyme Q10.</a></h1><p>Mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9 (ACAD9) deficiency is one of the common causes of respiratory chain complex I deficiency, which is characterized by cardiomyopathy, lactic acidemia, and muscle weakness. Infantile cardiomyopathy is the most common phenotype and is usually lethal by the age of  years. Riboflavin treatment is known to be effective in ~65% of the patients; however, the remaining are unresponsive to riboflavin and are in need of additional treatment measures. In this report, we describe a patient with ACAD9 deficiency who developed progressive cardiomyopathy at 8 months of age. As the patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) kept decreasing to 45.4% at 1 year 8 months, sodium pyruvate treatment was introduced together with a beta-blocker and coenzyme Q10. This resulted in a steady improvement, with full and sustained normalization of cardiac function without riboflavin. The therapy, therefore, might be a useful addition for the treatment of ACAD9 deficiency.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588348>Study of mitochondrial swelling, membrane fluidity and ROS production induced by nano-TiO and prevented by Fe incorporation.</a></h1><p>The potential impact of TiO and Fe incorporated TiO nanoparticles at the organelle level has been reported.

Genipin performs its pharmacological effects via activation of the phosphatidylinositol-4,-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether the PI3K/AKT pathway is involved in the protective effects of genipin against mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), and inflammation in ALI. We constructed in vivo and in vitro models of LPS-induced ALI. PI3K/AKT signaling was inhibited using LY294002. Pretreatment with genipin increased AKT phosphorylation, indicating that PI3K/AKT signaling was upregulated. Genipin pretreatment prevented LPS-induced histopathological deterioration, increased pulmonary edema, and decreased oxygenation index, all of which were inhibited using LY294002. In addition, genipin pretreatment attenuated LPS-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis, as indicated by improved mitochondrial dysfunction, downregulation of BAX (BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator), upregulation of BCL2 (BCL2 apoptosis regulator), inhibited the release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3, and cell apoptosis. Genipin pretreatment inhibited the LPS-induced upregulation of AF4/FMR2 family member 4 (CHOP), glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa (GRP78), and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) levels, indicating ERS suppression. Moreover, genipin pretreatment alleviated LPS-induced inflammation, indicating by blockade of nuclear factor kappa b (NF-κB) signaling activation and reduced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 levels in the lung and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. LY294002 could inhibit these genipin-induced protective effects against apoptosis, ERS, and inflammation. Thus, genipin significantly activates PI3K/AKT signaling to ameliorate -dependent apoptosis, ERS, and inflammation in LPS-induced ALI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This work was designed to study the protective effect of a newly synthesized thiocyanoacetamide (TA), in comparison with selenium (Se), against doxorubicin-induced in vitro toxicity in rat Sertoli cells (SCs). DOX was administered alone or in combination with Se or TA. The possible protective role of increased concentrations of TA (0.25, 0. and 1 mM) or Se (12, 25 and 50 μM) on SCs was tested against 1 μM of DOX. From this screening, only the least toxic doses of TA and Se were used for further analysis. DOX cytotoxicity, as well as its impact on SCs viability, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ), oxidative stress biomarkers, apoptosis and autophagy were assessed. Our results showed that DOX exerted its cytotoxic effect through a significant increase in cell death. DOX-mediated cell death was not related to autophagy nor to an overproduction of reactive oxygen species. It was rather due to apoptosis, as shown by the increased number of apoptotic cells and increased activity of caspase-3, or due to necrosis, as shown by the increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) extracellular activity. Still, Bax and Bcl-2 protein expression levels, as well as ΔΨ were not altered by the different treatments. Some individual doses of Se or TA induced a significant toxicity in SCs, however, when combined with DOX, there was a decrease in cell death, LDH extracellular activity, number of apoptotic cells and caspase-3 activity. Overall, our results indicate that DOX-mediated apoptosis in cultured SCs can possibly be averted through its association with specific doses of Se or TA. Nevertheless, TA showed a higher efficiency than Se in reducing DOX-induced toxicity in SCs by decreasing not only apoptosis, but also necrosis and autophagy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

HepG2 cells were incubated with various concentrations of bis(maltolato)oxovanadium(IV) or MnCl2 for 32 h for viability study. The higher concentrations (59   μM V, 54 nM Mn and 59   μM V+54 nM Mn) were used to study DNA damage and uptake of V and Mn. Comet assay was used for the study of nDNA damage; mtDNA damage was studied by determining deletions and number of copies of the ND1/ND4 mtDNA region. Cellular content of V and Mn was determined using ICPMS. Cellular exposure to 59   μM V decreased viability (14%) and damaged nDNA and mtDNA. This effect was partially prevented by the co-exposure to V + Mn. Exposure to V increased the cellular content of V and Mn (812.3% and 153.%, respectively). Exposure to Mn decreased the content of V and Mn (62% and 56%, respectively). Exposure to V + Mn increased V (261%) and decreased Mn (56%) content. The positive effects on cell viability and DNA damage when incubated with V + Mn could be due to the Mn-mediated inhibition of V uptake.Copyright © 2019.

The use of fluorescent proteins (FPs) greatly facilitated live-cell imaging of organelle dynamics and protein trafficking. One major limitation of this approach is that the fusion of an FP to a target protein can and often does compromise the function of the target protein and alter its subcellular localization. The optimization process to obtain a desirable fusion construct can be time-consuming or even unsuccessful. In this work, we set out to provide a validated set of FP-based markers for major organelles in the budding yeast (). Out of over 160 plasmids constructed, we present a final set of 42 plasmids, the recommendations for which are backed up by meticulous evaluations. The tool set includes three colors (green, red, and blue) and covers the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), nucleus, Golgi apparatus, endosomes, vacuoles, , peroxisomes, and lipid droplets. The fidelity of the markers was established by systematic cross-comparison and quantification. Functional assays were performed to examine the impact of marker expression on the secretory pathway, endocytic pathway, and metabolic activities of  and peroxisomes. Concomitantly, our work constitutes a reassessment of organelle identities in this model organism. Our data support the recognition that "late Golgi" and "early endosomes," two seemingly distinct terms, denote the same compartment in yeast. Conversely, all other organelles can be visually separated from each other at the resolution of conventional light microscopy, and quantification results justify their classification as distinct entities. Cells contain elaborate internal structures. For eukaryotic cells, like those in our bodies, the internal space is compartmentalized into membrane-bound organelles, each tasked with specialized functions. Oftentimes, one needs to visualize organelles to understand a complex cellular process. Here, we provide a validated set of fluorescent protein-based markers for major organelles in budding yeast. Yeast is a commonly used model when investigating basic mechanisms shared among eukaryotes. Fluorescent proteins are produced by cells themselves, avoiding the need for expensive chemical dyes. Through extensive cross-comparison, we make sure that each of our markers labels and only labels the intended organelle. We also carefully examined if the presence of our markers has any negative impact on the functionality of the cells and found none. Our work also helps answer a related question: are the structures we see really what we think they are?Copyright © 2019 Zhu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620655>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: A new look on treating stroke and traumatic brain injury.</a></h1><p>Although hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is common as a treatment for injuries, this study aimed to research the ability of HBOT in preconditioning to diminish any potential damage. The hypothesis stated that HBOT preconditioning alleviated the death of cells in primary rat neuronal cells (PRNCs) by transferring  from astrocytes. In this experiment, PRNCs were given an HBOT treatment before a tumor necrosis factor-alpha or lipopolysaccharide injury which resembled cell death associated with stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). After being examined, the study found more cell viability in the PRNCs that had received HBOT precondition and a mitochondrial transfer. The mitochondrial transfer was visualized by a series of images showing the transfer after the HBOT treatment. This study demonstrated the ability of HBOT preconditioning as a treatment for inflammation in stroke and TBI, with the transfer of  from astrocytes to PRNCs reducing cell death. Along with discussion of the study, this review also focuses on different stroke treatments in comparison with HBOT.Copyright: © 2019 Brain Circulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557897>STAT3 and STAT5 Activation in Solid Cancers.</a></h1><p>The Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT)3 and  proteins are activated by many cytokine receptors to regulate specific gene expression and mitochondrial functions. Their role in cancer is largely context-dependent as they can both act as oncogenes and tumor suppressors. We review here the role of STAT3/ activation in solid cancers and summarize their association with survival in cancer patients. The molecular mechanisms that underpin the oncogenic activity of STAT3/ signaling include the regulation of genes that control cell cycle and cell death. However, recent advances also highlight the critical role of STAT3/ target genes mediating inflammation and stemness. In addition, STAT3 mitochondrial functions are required for transformation. On the other hand, several tumor suppressor pathways act on or are activated by STAT3/ signaling, including tyrosine phosphatases, the sumo ligase Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT3 (PIAS3), the E3 ubiquitin ligase TATA Element Modulatory Factor/Androgen Receptor-Coactivator of 160 kDa (TMF/ARA160), the miRNAs miR-124 and miR-1181, the Protein of alternative reading frame 19 (p19ARF)/p53 pathway and the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 and 3 (SOCS1/3) proteins. Cancer mutations and epigenetic alterations may alter the balance between pro-oncogenic and tumor suppressor activities associated with STAT3/ signaling, explaining their context-dependent association with tumor progression both in human cancers and animal models.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518158>Ambient and supplemental magnetic fields promote myogenesis  a TRPC1-mitochondrial axis: evidence of a magnetic mitohormetic mechanism.</a></h1><p>We show that both supplemental and ambient magnetic fields modulate myogenesis. A lone 10 min exposure of myoblasts to 1. mT amplitude supplemental pulsed magnetic fields (PEMFs) accentuated  myogenesis by stimulating transient receptor potential (TRP)-C1-mediated calcium entry and downstream nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-transcriptional and P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF)-epigenetic cascades, whereas depriving myoblasts of ambient magnetic fields slowed myogenesis, reduced TRPC1 expression, and silenced NFAT-transcriptional and PCAF-epigenetic cascades. The expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α, the master regulator of mitochondriogenesis, was also enhanced by brief PEMF exposure. Accordingly, mitochondriogenesis and respiratory capacity were both enhanced with PEMF exposure, paralleling TRPC1 expression and pharmacological sensitivity. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9 knockdown of TRPC1 precluded proliferative and mitochondrial responses to supplemental PEMFs, whereas small interfering RNA gene silencing of TRPM7 did not, coinciding with data that magnetoreception did not coincide with the expression or function of other TRP channels. The aminoglycoside antibiotics antagonized and down-regulated TRPC1 expression and, when applied concomitantly with PEMF exposure, attenuated PEMF-stimulated calcium entry, mitochondrial respiration, proliferation, differentiation, and epigenetic directive in myoblasts, elucidating why the developmental potential of magnetic fields may have previously escaped detection. Mitochondrial-based survival adaptations were also activated upon PEMF stimulation. Magnetism thus deploys an authentic myogenic directive that relies on an interplay between  and TRPC1 to reach fruition.-Yap, J. L. Y., Tai, Y. K., Fröhlich, J., Fong, C. H. H., Yin, J. N., Foo, Z.

Demyelination was induced by a diet containing 0.2% w/w cuprizone (Cup) for 42 days and EA administered daily (, 50, and 100 mg/kg P.O) either with or without cuprizone in mice. Behavioral tests were assessed, and muscle tissue markers ofoxidative stress, mitochondrial parameters, mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, the Sirt3 protein level, and Sirt3 expression were also determined. Luxol fast blue staining and the behavioral tests were performed toassess the implemented model. In Cup group an increased oxidative stress in their muscle tissues was observed. Also, muscle  exhibited  dysfunction, lowered mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, Sirt3 protein level, and Sirt3 expression.EA prevented most of these anomalous alterations. Sub-chronicEA co-treatment dose-dependently ameliorated behavioral and muscular impairment in mice that received Cup.EA can effectively protect muscle tissue against cuprizone-induced demeylination via the mitochondrial protection, oxidative stress prevention and Sirt3 overexpression.Copyright © 2019.

To investigate whether central oligodendrocytosis and gliosis triggered an adaptive immune response, the impact of combining a standard (0.2%) or low (0.1%) dose of ingested CPZ with disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB), using pertussis toxin (PT), was assessed in mice. 0.2% CPZ(±PT) for  weeks produced oligodendrocytosis, demyelination and gliosis  marked splenic atrophy (37%) and reduced levels of CD4 (44%) and CD8 (61%). Conversely, 0.1% CPZ(±PT) produced a similar oligodendrocytosis, demyelination and gliosis but a smaller reduction in splenic CD4 (11%) and CD8 (14%) levels and  splenic atrophy. Long-term feeding of 0.1% CPZ(±PT) for 12 weeks produced similar reductions in CD4 (27%) and CD8 (43%), as well as splenic atrophy (33%), as seen with 0.2% CPZ(±PT) for  weeks. Collectively, these results suggest that 0.1% CPZ for  weeks may be a more promising model to study the 'inside-out' theory of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, neither CD4 nor CD8 were detected in the brain in CPZ±PT groups, indicating that CPZ-mediated suppression of peripheral immune organs is a major impediment to studying the 'inside-out' role of the adaptive immune system in this model over long time periods. Notably, CPZ(±PT)-feeding induced changes in the brain proteome related to the suppression of immune function, cellular metabolism, synaptic function and cellular structure/organization, indicating that demyelinating conditions, such as MS, can be initiated in the absence of adaptive immune system involvement.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547099>Serum Levels of Mitochondrial and Microbial Metabolites Reflect Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Different Stages of Sepsis.</a></h1><p>Mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in sepsis are being extensively studied in recent years. During our study, concentrations of microbial phenolic acids and mitochondrial metabolites (succinic, α-ketoglutaric, fumaric, itaconic acids) as indicators of sepsis and mitochondrial dysfunction, respectively, are measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in the blood of critically ill patients at the early and late stages of documented sepsis. The increase in levels of some phenylcarboxylic (phenyllactic (PhLA), -hydroxyphenylacetic (-HPhAA), -hydroxyphenyllactic (-HPhAA)) acids (PhCAs), simultaneously with a rise in levels of mitochondrial dicarboxylic acids, are mainly detected during the late stage of sepsis, especially succinic acid (up to 100-1000 µM). Itaconic acid is found in low concentrations (0.-2.3 µM) only at early-stage sepsis. PhCAs in vitro inhibits succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in isolated  but, unlike itaconic acid which acts as a competitive inhibitor of SDH, microbial metabolites most likely act on the ubiquinone binding site of the respiratory chain. A close correlation of the level of succinic acid in serum and sepsis-induced organ dysfunction is revealed, moreover the most significant correlation is observed at high concentrations of phenolic microbial metabolites (PhCAs) in late-stage sepsis. These data indicate the promise of such an approach for early detection, monitoring the progression of organ dysfunction and predicting the risk of non-survival in sepsis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470033>Gefitinib and curcumin-loaded nanoparticles enhance cell apoptosis in human oral cancer SAS cells in vitro and inhibit SAS cell xenografted tumor in vivo.</a></h1><p>Curcumin (Cur), a natural product, has been shown to have anti-tumor activities in many human cancer cells. Gefitinib (Gef) is a clinical drug for cancer patients. However, there is no available information to show whether Gef/Cur nanoparticles (NPs) increased cell apoptosis and anti-tumor effects on xenograft mice model in vivo. In this study, γ-polyglutamic acid-coated nanoparticles loaded with Gef and Cur (γ-PGA-Gef/Cur NPs) were developed and its physicochemical properties and antitumor effects were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The γ-PGA-Gef/Cur NPs showed 548. ± 93.7 nm in diameter and -40.3 ± 3.87 mV on surface charge. The loading efficiencies of Gef and Cur were 89. and 100%, respectively. γ-PGA-Gef/Cur NPs could be internalized into SAS cells and significantly decreased total cell viability of SAS cells. Western blotting results indicated that both free Gef/Cur and γ-PGA-Gef/Cur NPs induced apoptotic cell death via caspase- and -dependent pathways. In vivo studies indicated that treatments of PLGA NPs, free Gef/Cur, and γ-PGA-Gef/Cur NPs did not significantly affect appearances and bodyweights of mice. But the γ-PGA-Gef/Cur NPs significantly suppressed tumor size when comparing to free Gef/Cur-treated group.

PDT consumes tissue oxygen and destroys tumor vasculature, further hampering its own efficacy in promoting tumor deterioration. Therefore, overcoming the photodynamic exacerbation of tumor hypoxia is urgent.  Herein, we report a photodynamic nanoparticle with sustainable hypoxia remission skills by both intratumoral HO catalysis and targeted mitochondrial destruction. The MnO@MSNs@IR780 nanoparticles are formed by absorbing a photosensitizer (IR780) into 90 nm mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and capping the surface pores with  nm MnO nanoparticles.  These MnO nanoparticles can accumulate in tumors and respond to the HO-enriched tumor microenvironment by decomposing and catalyzing HO into O. Afterwards, IR780 is released and activated, spontaneously targeting the  due to its natural mitochondrial affinity. Under laser irradiation, this self-generated oxygen-enhanced PDT can destroy  and inhibit cell respiration, resulting in sustainable hypoxia remission in tumor tissues and consequently enhancing the therapeutic outcome.  experiments suggest that MnO@MSNs@IR780 exhibited highly mitochondrion-targeted properties and could sustainably inhibit tumor hypoxia. Additionally, the highest photoacoustic signal of HbO with the lowest Hb was observed in tumors from mice after PDT, indicating that these nanoparticles can also prevent tumor hypoxia .  Taken together, our study indicated a new approach for overcoming the sustainable hypoxia limitation in traditional PDT by targeted oxygen supplementation and  destruction.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601277>Mitochondrial abundance and function in muscle from beef steers with divergent residual feed intakes.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between muscle mitochondrial function and residual feed intake (RFI) in growing beef cattle. A 56-day feeding trial was conducted with 81 Angus × Hereford steers (initial BW = 378 ± 43 kg) from the University of California Sierra Foothills Research Station (Browns Valley, CA, USA). All steers were individually fed the same finishing ration (metabolizable energy = 3.28 Mcal/kg DM). Average daily gain (ADG), DM intake (DMI) and RFI were 1.82 ± 0.27, 8.89 ± 1.06 and 0.00 ± 0.55 kg/day, respectively. After the feeding trial, the steers were categorized into high, medium and low RFI groups. Low RFI steers consumed 13.6% less DM (P < 0.05) and had a 14.1% higher G : F ratio (P < 0.05) than the high RFI group. No differences between RFI groups were found in age, ADG or BW (P > 0.10). The most extreme individuals from the low and high RFI groups were selected to assess mitochondrial function (n =  low RFI and n = 6 high RFI). Mitochondrial respiration was measured using an oxygraph (Hansatech Instruments Ltd., Norfolk, UK). State 3 and State 4 respiration rates were similar between both groups (P > 0.10). Respiratory control ratios (RCRs, i.e., State 3 : State 4 oxygen uptakes) declined with animal age and were greater in low RFI steers (4.90) as compared to high RFI steers (4.26) when adjusted for age by analysis of covariance (P = 0.003). Mitochondrial complex II activity levels per gram of muscle were 42% greater in low RFI steers than in high RFI steers (P = 0.004). These data suggest that skeletal muscle  have greater reserve respiratory capacity and show greater coupling between respiration and phosphorylation in low RFI than in high RFI steers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581418>Beneficial Role of ROS in Cell Survival: Moderate Increases in HO Production Induced by Hepatocyte Isolation Mediate Stress Adaptation and Enhanced Survival.</a></h1><p>High levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can lead to impairment of cell structure, biomolecules' loss of function and cell death and are associated with liver diseases. Cells that survive increased ROS often undergo malignant transformation. Many cancer cells tolerate high levels of ROS. Here we report a transiently increased production of HO and concomitant upregulation of antioxidative enzymes triggered by hepatocyte isolation; the HO levels revert in about two days in culture. Three-day survival rate of the isolated cells in the presence of 2.-fold increase of HO is almost 80%. Apoptosis activation through the mitochondrial pathway is meanwhile reduced by inhibition of caspase-9 triggering. This reduction depends on the amount of HO production, as decreased production of HO in the presence of an antioxidant results in increased apoptosis triggering. These stress adaptations do not influence urea production, which is unchanged throughout the normal and stress adapted phases. We conclude that hepatocytes' stress adaptation is mediated by increased ROS production. In this case, high ROS improve cell survival.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614478>Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury Revisited: An Overview of the Latest Pharmacological Strategies.</a></h1><p>Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) permeates a variety of diseases and is a ubiquitous concern in every transplantation proceeding, from whole organs to modest grafts. Given its significance, efforts to evade the damaging effects of both ischemia and reperfusion are abundant in the literature and they consist of several strategies, such as applying pre-ischemic conditioning protocols, improving protection from preservation solutions, thus providing extended cold ischemia time and so on. In this review, we describe many of the latest pharmacological approaches that have been proven effective against IRI, while also revisiting well-established concepts and presenting recent pathophysiological findings in this ever-expanding field. A plethora of promising protocols has emerged in the last few years. They have been showing exciting results regarding protection against IRI by employing drugs that engage several strategies, such as modulating cell-surviving pathways, evading oxidative damage, physically protecting cell membrane integrity, and enhancing cell energetics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629737>Deficiency of nuclear receptor interaction protein leads to cardiomyopathy by disrupting sarcomere structure and mitochondrial respiration.</a></h1><p>Cardiomyopathy is a common and lethal complication in patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), one of the most prevalent forms of muscular dystrophy. The pathogenesis underlying LGMD-related cardiomyopathy remains unclear. NRIP (gene name DCAF6), a Ca-dependent calmodulin binding protein, was reduced in dystrophic muscles from LGMD patients. Mice lacking NRIP exhibit a myopathic phenotype resembling that in LGMD patients, making NRIP deficiency a potential culprit leading to cardiomyopathy. This study aimed to determine if NRIP deficiency leads to cardiomyopathy and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.NRIP expression was reduced in both human and mouse failing hearts. Muscle-specific NRIP knockout (MCK-Cre::Dcaf6) mouse heart and isolated cardiomyocytes exhibited markedly reduced contractility. Transmission electron microscopy revealed abnormal sarcomere structures and mitochondrial morphology in MCK-Cre::Dcaf6 hearts. Protein co-immunoprecipitation and confocal imaging revealed that NRIP interacts with α-actinin 2 (ACTN2) at the Z-disc. We found that NRIP facilitated ACTN2-mediated F-actin bundling, and that NRIP deficiency resulted in reduced binding between Z-disc proteins ACTN2 and Cap-Z. In addition, NRIP-deficiency led to increased mitochondrial ROS and impaired mitochondrial respiration/ATP production owing to elevated cellular NADH/NAD ratios. Treatment with -directed antioxidant mitoTEMPO or NAD precursor nicotinic acid restored mitochondrial function and cardiac contractility in MCK-Cre::Dcaf6 mice.NRIP is essential to maintain sarcomere structure and mitochondrial/contractile function in cardiomyocytes. Our results revealed a novel role for NRIP deficiency in the pathogenesis of LGMD and heart failure. Targeting NRIP, therefore, could be a powerful new approach to treat myocardial dysfunction in LGMD and heart failure patients.Copyright © 2019.

In Experiment 1, assessment of cell membrane integrity by trypan blue exclusion staining was used to select the best cryoprotectant solution for each cryopreservation method. Primary growth (PG) oocytes showed the best percentage of membrane integrity (63. ± 2.99%) when SF4 solution (2 M methanol + 0.1 M trehalose + 10% egg yolk solution) was employed. The vitrification solution, which presented the highest membrane integrity (V2; 1. M methanol + . M MeSO + 0. M sucrose + 10% egg yolk solution) was selected for Experiment 2. Experiment 2 aimed to compare the vitrification and slow freezing techniques in the following parameters: morphology, oxidative stress, mitochondrial activity, and DNA damage. Frozen ovarian tissue showed higher ROS levels and lower mitochondrial activity than vitrified ovarian tissue. Ultrastructural observations of frozen PG oocytes showed rupture of the plasma membrane, loss of intracellular contents and a large number of damaged , while vitrified PG oocytes had intact  and cell plasma membranes.

The excess mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) could not only inhibit the function of P-gp through insufficient adenosine triphosphate supply but also cause apoptosis in MDR cells. Here, we designed a  targeting nanoparticulate system (GNPs-P-Dox-GA) for overcoming MDR through enhanced ROS generation, where increased cellular uptake as well as  accumulation were both realized by glycyrrhetinic acid (GA). First, doxorubicin was conjugated with GA (GA-Dox) and then grafted onto a -(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer backbone via hydrazone bond (P-Dox-GA). The obtained P-Dox-GA was subsequently attached to the surface of gelatin nanoparticles (GNPs). As gelatin is a substrate of tumor extracellular metal matrix protease-2 (MMP2), GNPs-P-Dox-GA nanoparticles could be degraded and release small size P-Dox-GA to facilitate tumor tissue penetration. After P-Dox-GA internalized by tumor cells under GA mediation, Dox-GA detached from HPMA copolymer through hydrolysis of hydrazone bond and then efficiently delivered to . Compared to non-GA modified carriers, GNPs-P-Dox-GA exhibited increased cellular uptake nearly 4-fold and  distribution 8.8-fold, and increased ROS production level nearly 3-fold, significantly decreased efflux rate (55% compared with Dox group) in drug resistant HepG2/ADR cells, and then led to improved  antitumor efficiency in HepG2/ADR cells (IC only 19.% of unmodified ones) as well as exciting  antitumor efficiency on HepG2/ADR heterotopic tumor nude mice (1.75-fold higher tumor growth inhibition rate than free drug).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31508966>A Novel Conjugate of Bis[((4-bromophenyl)amino)quinazoline], a EGFR-TK Ligand, with a Fluorescent Ru(II)-Bipyridine Complex Exhibits Specific Subcellular Localization in .</a></h1><p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a key target in anticancer research, whose aberrant function in malignancies has been linked to severe irregularities in critical cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. EGFR mutant variants, either transmembrane or translocated to the  and/or the nucleus, often exhibit resistance to EGFR inhibitors. The ability to noninvasively image and quantify EGFR provides novel approaches in the detection, monitoring, and treatment of EGFR-related malignancies. The current study aimed to deliver a new theranostic agent that combines fluorescence imaging properties with EGFR inhibition. This was achieved via conjugation of an in-house-developed ((4-bromophenyl)amino)quinazoline inhibitor of mutant EGFR-TK, selected from a focused aminoquinazoline library, with a [Ru(bipyridine)] fluorophore. A triethyleneglycol-derived diamino linker featuring (+)-ionizable sites was employed to link the two functional moieties, affording two unprecedented Ru conjugates with 1:1 and 2:1 stoichiometry of aminoquinazoline to the Ru complex (mono-quinazoline-Ru-conjugate and bis-quinazoline-Ru-conjugate, respectively). The bis-quinazoline-Ru-conjugate, which retains an essential inhibitory activity, was found by fluorescence imaging to be effectively uptaken by Uppsala 87 malignant glioma (grade IV malignant glioma) cells. The fluorescence imaging study and a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer study indicated a specific subcellular distribution of the conjugate that coincides with that of a -targeted dye, suggesting mitochondrial localization of the conjugate and potential association with -translocated forms of EGFR.

Recently, we reported that isoflurane induced the attenuation of mitochondrial respiration caused by complex I substrates. This process was not associated with endogenous production of mitochondrial nitric oxide (NO). In the present study, we investigated the effects of isoflurane on mitochondrial respiration and ROS production using complex II substrates. The detailed mechanism of these effects was explored with regards to NO production and the expression of mitochondrial ATP‑dependent K+ (mKATP) channels.  were isolated from the heart of Sprague‑Dawley rats. The respiratory rates of  (0. mg/ml) were measured via polarography at 28˚C with computer‑controlled Clark‑type O2 electrodes. The complex II substrate succinate ( mM) was used; 0.25 mM of isoflurane was administered prior to ADP‑initiated state 3 respiration. The mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was measured under treatment with the substrate succinate, or succinate in the presence of the complex I inhibitor rotenone. The detection was achieved in a cuvette‑based spectrophotometer operating at wavelengths of 503 nm (excitation) 527 nm (emission) in the presence of 50 nM of the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123. The H2O2 release rates in the  were measured spectrophotometrically with succinate, or succinate and rotenone using the fluorescent dye Amplex red (12.‑25 µM). The results indicated that isoflurane increased the state 3 and 4 respiration rates caused by succinate, which were higher than those noted in the control group in the presence of succinate alone. The NOS inhibitor L‑NIO or the NO‑sensitive guanylyl cyclase 1H‑[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3‑a]quinoxalin‑1‑one did not inhibit the increase in the respiration rate (state 3) induced by isoflurane. The ROS scavengers SPBN and manganese (III) tetrakis (4‑benzoic acid) porphyrin chloride inhibited the increase in the respiration rate (state 3 and 4) induced by isoflurane. This effect was not noted for the putative KATP channel blockers ‑hydroxydecanoic acid and glibenclamide. Isoflurane caused a greater decrease in the concentration of H2O2 during ADP‑initiated state 3 respiration, and L‑N5‑(1‑Iminoethyl)‑ornithine did not inhibit this effect. In conclusion, isoflurane was determined to modulate mitochondrial respiration and ROS production caused by the complex II substrate succinate. These effects were independent of endogenous mitochondrial NO generation and mitochondrial KATP channel opening.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481398>Syntaphilin-Mediated Docking of  at the Growth Cone Is Dispensable for Axon Elongation .</a></h1><p> are abundantly detected at the growth cone, the dynamic distal tip of developing axons that directs growth and guidance.

Here, we show that in retinal axons elongating along the optic tract in zebrafish,  accumulate in the central area of the growth cone and are occasionally observed in filopodia extending from the growth cone periphery. Mitochondrial behavior at the growth cone  is dynamic, with mitochondrial positioning and anterograde transport strongly correlating with growth cone behavior and axon outgrowth. Using novel zebrafish mutant lines that lack the mitochondrial anchoring proteins Syntaphilin a and b, we further show that Syntaphilins contribute to mitochondrial immobilization at the growth cone. Syntaphilins are, however, not required for proper growth cone morphology and axon growth , indicating that Syntaphilin-mediated anchoring of  at the growth cone plays only a minor role in elongating axons.Copyright © 2019 Verreet et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655165>Disturbance of mitochondrial functions associated with permeability transition pore opening induced by cis--tetradecenoic and myristic acids in liver of adolescent rats.</a></h1><p>Patients affected by very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency commonly present liver dysfunction whose pathogenesis is poorly known.

Mitochondrion-targeted antioxidant peptide SS31 has been revealed to be responsible for certain cardiovascular disease by ameliorating oxidative stress injury. But whether it protects a septic heart remains little known. This study sought to prove that SS31 was capable of improving sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction dramatically. C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS), exposed to systemic inflammation. Thirty-five C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four groups: sham group, LPS group ( mg/kg), SS31 group ( mg/kg), and SS31 + LPS group (treatment group). Heart tissues were harvested for pathological examination at the indicated time points. H9C2 cell were treated with LPS with or without the presence of SS31 (10 μM) at 37 °C to assess the effect on cardiomyocytes at the indicated time points. SS31 restored myocardial morphological damage and suppressed inflammatory response as evidenced by significantly decreasing the mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in vitro and in vivo. In addition, myocardial energy deficiency secondary to sepsis was remarkedly ameliorated by SS31. Furthermore, we found that SS-31 normalized the activity of malondialdehyde, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase in vitro and in vivo, and maintained mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) as well. And western blot was applied to measure the expressions of p-p38MAPK, p-JNK1/2, p-ERK, p62, and NF-κB p65; the results illuminated that the cardioprotective effect of SS31 was partly linked to NF-κB.

The selection of appropriate internal reference genes is very important to accurately determine target gene expression via quantitative real-time PCR. However, internal reference gene selection has never been conducted in B. semperflorens. In this study, seven candidate reference genes of B. semperflorens, including 18S ribosomal RNA (Bs18S), pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein (BsPPR), actin-related protein  isoform X2 (BsACT), DNAJ homologue subfamily C member 17 (BsDNAJ), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (BsGAPDH), NAD-dependent malic enzyme 59 kDa isoform,  (BsNAD-ME), and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase CYP26-2, chloroplast (BsCYP), which were obtained from our previous studies, were selected. The stabilities of these genes under stress conditions were analysed using geNorm and NormFinder. Validation of target gene expressions, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (BsPAL) and respiratory burst oxidase homologue D (BsRBOHD) under biotic and abiotic conditions, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (BsPAL), anthocyanidin synthase (BsANS), chalcone synthase (BsCHS), and flavanone-3-hydroxylase (BsF3H) under low temperature, using these seven internal reference genes for normalisation further confirmed the stabilities of the selected genes and indicated the need for reference gene selection for normalising gene expressions in B. semperflorens. Of the seven candidate reference genes, the combination of BsACT, BsDNAJ, and BsNAD-ME was the ideal reference gene set for normalising gene expression in samples under biotic conditions. BsCYP combined with BsACT or BsGAPDH was the best reference gene pair under abiotic conditions. BsACT and BsPPR could be combined to normalise gene expression under low temperature.

This indicates that an organism can become tolerant to the loss of an essential gene under certain circumstances during evolution, via the manifestation of 'masked' alternative mechanisms. In our quest to systematically uncover masked mechanisms in eukaryotic cells, we developed an extragenic suppressor screening method using haploid spores deleted of an essential gene in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We screened for the 'bypass' suppressors of lethality of 92 randomly selected genes that are essential for viability in standard laboratory culture conditions. Remarkably, extragenic mutations bypassed the essentiality of as many as 20 genes (22%), 15 of which have not been previously reported. Half of the bypass-suppressible genes were involved in  function; we also identified multiple genes regulating RNA processing. 18 suppressible genes were conserved in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but 13 of them were non-essential in that species. These trends suggest that essentiality bypass is not a rare event and that each organism may be endowed with secondary or backup mechanisms that can substitute for primary mechanisms in various biological processes.

Dysfunctional  are associated with lower muscle strength and muscle atrophy in cancer patients, yet poorly described in human cachexia. We herein investigated mitochondrial morphology, autophagy and apoptosis in the skeletal muscle of patients with gastrointestinal cancer-associated cachexia (CC), as compared with a weight-stable cancer group (WSC). CC showed prominent weight loss and increased circulating levels of serum C-reactive protein, lower body mass index and decreased circulating hemoglobin, when compared to WSC. Electron microscopy analysis revealed an increase in intermyofibrillar mitochondrial area in CC, as compared to WSC. Relative gene expression of Fission 1, a protein related to mitochondrial fission, was increased in CC, as compared to WSC. LC3 II, autophagy-related (ATG)  and 7 essential proteins for autophagosome formation, presented higher content in the cachectic group. Protein levels of phosphorylated p53 (Ser46), activated caspase 8 (Asp384) and 9 (Asp315) were also increased in the skeletal muscle of CC. Overall, our results demonstrate that human cancer-associated cachexia leads to exacerbated muscle-stress response that may culminate in muscle loss, which is in part due to disruption of mitochondrial morphology, dysfunctional autophagy and increased apoptosis.

Thus, it is vitally important to develop facile, rapid and accurate analytical methods for the detection of HClO/ClO- in vitro and in vivo. In this work, we have constructed three meso-substituted BODIPY selenides with different hydrocarbyl groups (ethyl for BSe-Et, benzyl for BSe-Bz and phenyl for BSe-Ph) as fluorescent probes for the detection of HClO/ClO-. All three non-fluorescent probes can sense HClO/ClO- to form fluorescent selenoxides by blocking the photo-induced electron transfer process. Their sensing properties display a clear relationship with the structure of the hydrocarbyl. The sensing reactivity is heavily dependent on the electron-donating ability of hydrocarbyls, with the order of the response time as BSe-Et (2 s) < BSe-Bz ( s) ≪ BSe-Ph (>100 s). Both BSe-Et and BSe-Bz afford a large fluorescence response and very low detection limits (0.3 nM and 0.8 nM), and BSe-Bz displays a higher selectivity over BSe-Et. Finally, as a representative, BSe-Bz was successfully applied to the detection of exo- and endogenous HClO in living cells, and demonstrated to be a -localized fluorescent probe.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669273>Characterization and anti-tumor bioactivity of astragalus polysaccharides by immunomodulation.</a></h1><p>Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) has attracted growing interests in the field of anti-cancer by direct killing effect and improving immune function. In this study, the structure and composition of APS was determined, following the evaluation of in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity of APS targeted macrophages and host immune system based on immunoregulated strategy. The results indicated that APS had no direct cytotoxicity against 4T1 cells, but APS mediated macrophages could significantly inhibit the growth of 4T1 cells by the induction of cell cycle arrest (G2 phase) and cell apoptosis. APS mediated macrophages promoted the apoptosis of 4T1 cells mainly through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. The in vivo findings demonstrated that APS could markedly improve the thymus index and spleen index, and restore the structure of the damaged thymus and spleen tissue. APS could significantly enhance the proliferation of spleen lymphocytes and increase phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages in mice. Furthermore, APS was capable of up-regulating the expression of IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-γ in peripheral blood. APS combined with -FU could improve the anti-tumor effect accompanied by the immunosuppressive alleviation of -FU on immune system, which may be suitable as an immune adjuvant for chemotherapy.Copyright © 2019.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in the progression of septic lung injury. Mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, and biogenesis converge to constitute the assiduous quality control of  (MQC). Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protects against sepsis-induced ALI through the modulation of mitochondrial dynamics. However, the causal relationship between HO-1 and the general processes of MQC, and their associated cellular pathways in sepsis-related ALI remain ill-defined. Herein, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in Sprague-Dawley rats together with LPS-induced oxidative injury in RAW264.7 macrophages were used to investigate whether the PI3K/Akt pathway-mediated induction of HO-1 preserves MQC and alleviates septic lung injury. After pretreatment with hemin, a potent inducer of HO-1, LPS-induced cell apoptosis, enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation, and mitochondrial membrane potential damage were significantly reduced in macrophages. In rats, these effects were accompanied by a higher survival rate, less damage to lung tissue, a 28.% elevation in lung  MnSOD activity, and a 39.2% increase in respiratory control ratios. Concomitantly, HO-1 induction preserved the dynamic process of mitochondrial fusion/fission (Mfn2, OPA1, Drp1), promoted mitochondrial biogenesis (NRF1, PGC1α, Tfam), and facilitated the key mediators of mitochondrial mitophagy (Parkin, PINK1) at mRNA and protein levels. Notably, LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, or knockdown of PI3K by small interfering RNA significantly suppressed Akt phosphorylation, attenuated HO-1 induction, and further reversed these beneficial effects evoked by hemin pretreatment in RAW264.7 cells or rats received LPS, indicating a direct involvement of PI3K/Akt pathway. Taken together, our results indicated that HO-1 activation, through PI3K/Akt pathway, plays a critical role in protecting lung from oxidative injury in the setting of sepsis by regulating MQC. HO-1 may therefore be a therapeutic target for the prevention sepsis-related lung injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623409>Mitochondrial Function in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) Is Enhanced, Together with Increased Reactive Oxygen Species, in Severe Asthmatic Patients in Exacerbation.</a></h1><p>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung syndrome with an increasing prevalence and a rare but significant risk of death. Its pathophysiology is complex, and therefore we investigated at the systemic level a potential implication of oxidative stress and of peripheral blood mononuclear cells' (PBMC) mitochondrial function. Twenty severe asthmatic patients with severe exacerbation (GINA 4-) and 20 healthy volunteers participated at the study. Mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes activities using different substrates and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were determined in both groups by high-resolution respirometry and electronic paramagnetic resonance, respectively. Healthy PBMC were also incubated with a pool of plasma of severe asthmatics or healthy controls. Mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes activity (+52.45%,  = 0.015 for V) and ROS production (+34.3%,  = 0.02) were increased in asthmatic patients. Increased ROS did not originate mainly from . Plasma of severe asthmatics significantly increased healthy PBMC mitochondrial dioxygen consumption (+56.8%,  = 0.031). In conclusion, such asthma endotype, characterized by increased PMBCs mitochondrial oxidative capacity and ROS production likely related to a plasma constituent, may reflect activation of the immune system. Further studies are needed to determine whether increased PBMC mitochondrial respiration might have protective effects, opening thus new therapeutic approaches.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461494>Kinetic analysis of ATP hydrolysis by complex V in four murine tissues: Towards an assay suitable for clinical diagnosis.</a></h1><p>ATP synthase, the mitochondrial complex V, plays a major role in bioenergetics and its defects lead to severe diseases. Lack of a consensual protocol for the assay of complex V activity probably explains the under-representation of complex V defect among mitochondrial diseases. The aim of this work was to elaborate a fast, simple and reliable method to check the maximal complex V capacity in samples relevant to clinical diagnosis.Using homogenates from four different murine organs, we tested the use of dodecylmaltoside, stability of the activity, linearity with protein amount, sensitivity to oligomycin and to exogenous inhibitory factor 1 (IF1), influence of freezing, and impact of mitochondrial purification.We obtained organ-dependent, reproducible and stable complex V specific activities, similar with fresh and frozen organs. Similar inhibition by oligomycin and exogenous IF1 demonstrated tight coupling between F1 and F0 domains. The Michaelis constant for MgATP had close values for all organs, in the 150-220 μM range. Complex V catalytic turnover rate, as measured in preparations solubilized in detergent using immunotitration and activity measurements, was more than three times higher in extracts from brain or muscle than in extracts from heart or liver. This tissue specificity suggested post-translational modifications. Concomitant measurement of respiratory activities showed only slightly different complex II/complex V ratio in the four organs. In contrast, complex I/complex V ratio differed in brain as compared to the three other organs because of a high complex I activity in brain.  purification preserved these ratios, except for brain where selective degradation of complex I occurred. Therefore, mitochondrial purification could introduce a biased enzymatic evaluation.Altogether, this work demonstrates that a reliable assay of complex V activity is perfectly possible with very small samples from frozen biopsies, which was confirmed using control and deficient human muscles.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644243>Nucleoside Analogues.</a></h1><p>The nucleoside analogues are an important class of antiviral agents now commonly used in the therapy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B virus (HBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The nucleoside analogues resemble naturally occurring nucleosides and act by causing termination of the nascent DNA chain. These agents are generally safe and well tolerated as they are used by the viral, but not human polymerases in DNA replication. Actually, nucleoside analogues are a large class of agents that include drugs for cancer (cytarabine, gemcitabine, mercaptopurine), rheumatologic diseases (azathioprine, allpurinol) and even bacterial infections (trimethoprim). The nucleoside analogues used to treat HIV infection are often referred to as reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). However, they have activity against both DNA dependent and RNA dependent DNA polymerases. They are believed to inhibit viral replication by several mechanisms, either by competitive inhibition of the viral polymerase or by DNA chain termination. Many of the antiviral nucleoside analogues are blocked at the 3’ hydroxyl group of the deoxyribonucleic acid, which results in failure of elongation of the nascent DNA molecule. Other antiviral nucleoside analogues are negative enantiomers (L-forms: lamivudine, emtricitabine, telbivudine) of the natural (D-form) nucleosides and interfere with replication, partially because of steric hindrance when they are taken up by the viral polymerase or added to the DNA molecule. Nucleoside analogues that are phosphorylated at the ’ site are often referred to as nucleotide analogues, but this distinction is artificial as these agents (tenofovir, adefovir) are also nucleoside analogues. These features of the structure of nucleoside analogues are important because of the danger that they might be used by human polymerases and incorporated into RNA or DNA, which is the basis of the serious toxicities of the nucleoside analogues. Nucleoside analogues can cause liver injury by several mechanisms. Most characteristic is a mitochondrial type of hepatic injury that is probably caused by the nucleoside analogue becoming incorporated into or blocking mitochondrial DNA synthesis by the mitochondrial gamma polymerase, leading to a depletion of  or decrease in their function. Mitochondrial injury can affect multiple tissues thereby causing myopathy, neuropathy, pancreatitis, bone marrow suppression and/or hepatic injury. The hepatic injury is characterized by accumulation of lactic acidosis, microvesicular steatosis and hepatic synthetic failure (LASH). Serum aminotransferase levels may be minimally elevated and jaundice arises late. The most dramatic example of hepatic mitochondrial injury occurred with the drug fialuridine (FIAU), a nucleoside analogue that was withdrawn after several fatalities due to hepatic failure, lactic acidosis and pancreatitis arising 2 to 3 months after initiation of therapy during phase 2 trials in humans. A similar, but rare and less dramatic and partially reversible hepatic mitochondrial injury has been linked to use of didanosine (dideoxyinosine: ddI), zalcitabine (dideoxycytine: ddC), stavudine (d4T) and less commonly to zidovudine (AZT).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567378>Involvement of phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1-Parkin-mediated mitophagy in septic acute kidney injury.</a></h1><p>Studies have reported mitophagy activation in renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) in acute kidney injury (AKI). Phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Parkin are involved in mitophagy regulation; however, little is known about the role of PINK1-Parkin mitophagy in septic AKI. Here we investigated whether the PINK1-Parkin mitophagy pathway is involved in septic AKI and its effects on cell apoptosis in vitro and on renal functions in vivo.Mitophagy-related gene expression was determined using Western blot assay in human RTEC cell line HK-2 stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and in RTECs from septic AKI rats induced by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP). Autophagy-related ultrastructural features in rat RTECs were observed using electron microscopy. Gain- and loss-of-function approaches were performed to investigate the role of the PINK1-Parkin pathway in HK-2 cell mitophagy. Autophagy activators and inhibitors were used to assess the effects of mitophagy modulation on cell apoptosis in vitro and on renal functions in vivo.LPS stimulation could significantly induce LC3-II and BECN-1 protein expression (LC3-II: 1.72 ± 0.05 vs. 1.00 ± 0.05, P < 0.05; BECN-1: .33 ± 0.57 vs. 1.00 ± 0.14, P < 0.05) at 4 h in vitro. Similarly, LC3-II, and BECN-1 protein levels were significantly increased and peaked at 2 h after CLP (LC3-II: 3.33 ± 0.12 vs. 1.03 ± 0.15, P < 0.05; BECN-1: 1.57 ± 0.26 vs. 1.02 ± 0.11, P < 0.05) in vivo compared with those after sham operation. Mitochondrial deformation and mitolysosome-mediated  clearance were observed in RTECs from septic rats. PINK1 knockdown significantly attenuated LC3-II protein expression (1.35 ± 0.21 vs. 2.38 ± 0.22, P < 0.05), whereas PINK1 overexpression markedly enhanced LC3-II protein expression (2.07 ± 0.21 vs. 1.29 ± 0.19, P < 0.05) compared with LPS-stimulated HK-2 cells. LPS-induced proapoptotic protein expression remained unchanged in autophagy activator-treated HK-2 cells and was significantly attenuated in PINK1-overexpressing cells, but was remarkably upregulated in autophagy inhibitor-treated and in PINK1-depleted cells. Consistent results were observed in flow cytometric apoptosis assay and in renal function indicators in rats.PINK1-Parkin-mediated mitophagy might play a protective role in septic AKI, serving as a potential therapeutic target for septic AKI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31512726>Mitochondrial dysfunction induced by high estradiol concentrations in endometrial epithelial cells.</a></h1><p>A supraphysiological estradiol (E2) concentration after ovarian stimulation is known to result in lower embryo implantation rates in in vitro fertilization (IVF). Endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) apoptosis occurs after the stimulation with high E2 concentrations, and  play important roles in cell apoptosis.To investigate the mitochondrial function in EECs after the stimulation with high E2 concentrations.Human EECs were purified and cultured with different E2 concentrations (10-10, 10-9, 10-8, 10-7 M) in vitro, in which 10-7 M is supraphysiologically high. Eight-week-old female mouse endometrium was obtained . days after the injection of 1.25 IU or 20 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG), roughly during the embryo implantation window, to examine the in vivo effects of high E2 concentrations on mouse EECs.In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated decreased mitochondrial DNA contents and ATP formation after EECs were stimulated with supraphysiologically high E2 concentrations than those stimulated with a physiologic E2 concentration. Less prominent immunofluorescence mitochondrial staining, fewer  number under electron microscopy, lower JC-1 aggregate/monomer ratio, and greater reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were found after EECs were stimulated with supraphysiologically high E2 concentrations. The high E2-induced ROS production was reduced when EECs were pretreated with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) in vitro, but remained unchanged after the pretreatment with coenzyme Q10.High E2 concentrations increase extra-mitochondrial ROS production in EECs and subsequently result in mitochondrial dysfunction.© Endocrine Society 2019.

For a future in vivo application, it will be crucial to know the physical parameters and the biological mechanisms inducing cell death for a rational adaptation of the system to real time situation. Regarding the AuNP functionalization, we observed that a relationship of 2. × 10 AuNP/mL to 20 µg/mL C-CPE maximized the killing efficiency. Regardingphysical parameters, a laser fluence up to 30 mJ/cm increased the killing efficiency. Independent from the applied laser fluence, the maximal killing efficiency was achieved at a scanning velocity of  mm/s. In 3D matrigel culture system, the GNOME-LP/C-CPE-AuNP completely destroyed spheroids composed of Caco-2 cells and reduced OE-33 cell spheroid formation. At the biology level, GNOME-LP/C-CPE-AuNP-treated cells bound annexin V and showed reduced  activity. However, an increased caspase-3/7 activity in the cells was not found. Similarly, DNA analysis revealed no apoptosis-related DNA ladder. The results suggest that the GNOME-LP/C-CPE-AuNP treatment induced necrotic than apoptotic reaction in tumor cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31488624>Early feeding of rainbow trout () with methionine-deficient diet over a 2 week period: consequences for liver  in juveniles.</a></h1><p>Methionine is a key factor in modulating the cellular availability of the main biological methyl donor -adenosylmethionine (SAM), which is required for all biological methylation reactions including DNA and histone methylation. As such, it represents a potential critical factor in nutritional programming. Here, we investigated whether early methionine restriction at first feeding could have long-term programmed metabolic consequences in rainbow trout. For this purpose, trout fry were fed with either a control diet (C) or a methionine-deficient diet (MD) for 2 weeks from the first exogenous feeding. Next, fish were subjected to a  month growth trial with a standard diet followed by a 2 week challenge (with the MD or C diet) to test the programming effect of the early methionine restriction. The results showed that, whatever the dietary treatment of fry, the 2 week challenge with the MD diet led to a general mitochondrial defect associated with an increase in endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitophagy and apoptosis, highlighting the existence of complex cross-talk between these different functions. Moreover, for the first time, we also observed that fish fed the MD diet at the first meal later exhibited an increase in several critical factors of mitophagy, hinting that the early nutritional stimulus with methionine deficiency resulted in long-term programming of this cell function. Together, these data extend our understanding of the role of dietary methionine and emphasize the potential for this amino acid in the application of new feeding strategies, such as nutritional programming, to optimize the nutrition and health of farmed fish.© 2019.

Epilepsy seizures was induced by repetitive injections of pentylenetetrazol at a dose of 37 mg per kg. Propionate (37., 50 and 75 mg/kg) as well as sodium valproate (300 mg/kg) were administrated intragastrically (i.g.) 1 h before each PTZ injection and continued for 40 days. The influence of propionate was assessed by many biochemical assays and neurobehavioral experiments. The results of gas chromatography (GC) analysis indicated that increased concentration of propionate can be explored in hippocampus area of propionate + PTZ treated animals. Propionate decreased epilepsy seizure intensity, increased latency of seizures. Meanwhile, propionate treatment reversed the structure disruption of the , improved ATP level and lessened 8-OHdG level in the brains of animals with seizures. In addition, we find propionate pretreated can increase activities of the antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, as well as GSH-Px) in . Additionally, propionate reduced neuronal loss in hippocampus and our results suggest that HIF-1α/ERK pathway and neuron necrosis exists potential linkage during epileptogenesis. Moreover, as a result, propionate administration can significantly improve the neurological function estimated by a battery of functional tests. In conclusion, treatment with propionate attenuates mitochondrial disruption, hippocampal apoptosis and neurological deficits in a mouse model of epilepsy seizures. Therefore, propionate, currently used as a food preservative, has a potential additional advantage of ameliorating epilepsy seizures.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI) still needs evidence.We evaluated the effect of mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone on folic acid (FA)-induced AKI in mice.Strikingly, the mice pretreated with rotenone at a dose of 200 ppm in food showed exacerbated kidney injury as shown by higher levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine compared with FA alone group. Meanwhile, both renal tubular injury score and the expression of renal tubular injury marker neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin were further elevated in rotenone-pretreated mice, suggesting the deteriorated renal tubular injury. Moreover, the decrements of mitochondrial DNA copy number and the expressions of mitochondrial Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1, and -specific superoxide dismutase (SOD2) in the kidneys of FA-treated mice were further reduced in rotenone-pretreated mice, indicating the aggravated mitochondrial damage. In parallel with the SOD2 reduction, the oxidative stress markers of malondialdehyde and HO-1 displayed greater increment in AKI mice with rotenone pretreatment in line with the deteriorated apoptotic response and inflammation.Our results suggested that the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity aggravated renal tubular injury, mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, and inflammation in FA-induced AKI.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

The best condition for AgNPs synthesis was with 0. g of peel extract, 7. mM silver nitrate at 45 °C, ~pH 4 for 16 h. The synthesized AgNPs were spherical and 32.7 ± .7 nm in size. To test its efficiency to be used as drug carrier, plant-based drug, protocatechuic acid (PCA) was used as a test drug. AgNPs loaded with PCA (AgPCA) resulted in 80% of inhibition at 15.6 µg/mL as compared to AgNPs which only killed % of HCT116 colorectal cells at same concentration. The IC of AgNPs and AgPCA for HCT116 were 40.2 and 10.7 µg/mL, respectively. At 15.6 µg/mL, AgPCA was not toxic to the tested colon normal cells, CCD112. Ag-based drug carrier could also potentially reduce the toxicity of loaded drug as the IC of PCA alone (148.1 µg/mL) was higher than IC of AgPCA (10.7 µg/mL) against HCT116. Further, 24-h treatment of 15.6 µg/mL AgPCA resulted in loss of membrane potential in the  of HCT116 cells and increased level of reaction oxygen species (ROS). These could be the cellular killing mechanisms of AgPCA.

However, excessive autophagy can be deleterious to cardiomyocytes. CCN1/Cyr61, a matricellular protein, is expressed in the stressed heart to induce cardiomyopathy. The role of autophagy in CCN1-associated cardiotoxicity was not clear. Here, we found that autophagy was induced in the myocardium of the isoproterenol (ISO; 100 mg/kg/day for  days; s.c.) treated mice, where CCN1 expression is colocalized. The knock-in mice carrying an integrin α6β1-binding-defective mutant allele Ccn1-dm were resistant to the ISO-induced cardiac injury and autophagy. Our in vitro studies demonstrated that CCN1 dose- and time-dependently induced GFP-LC3-labeled autophagosome formation in rat cardiomyoblast H9c2 cells. The formation of autolysosomes in response to CCN1 ( μg/ml; 3 h) treatment was identified by the acridine orange staining. The autophagy induction was confirmed by the elevated protein levels of Beclin 1, Atg5, and LC3-II, and the decrease of p62. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine or by silencing Atg5 gene enabled CCN1-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells, suggesting a protective role of autophagy. CCN1 binds to integrin α6β1 to induce autophagy through reactive oxygen species, and the activation of ERK and JNK. Furthermore, mitophagy was observed after CCN1 treatment for the clearance of depolarized . Together, these results demonstrated that autophagy is induced in response to CCN1/α6β1 signaling in cardiomyocytes to alleviate CCN1-associated cardiotoxicity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588022>Dinucleotide Degradation by REXO2 Maintains Promoter Specificity in Mammalian .</a></h1><p>Oligoribonucleases are conserved enzymes that degrade short RNA molecules of up to  nt in length and are assumed to constitute the final stage of RNA turnover.

This study aimed at assessing the hepatotoxicity of 3-MMC. For this purpose, Wistar rat hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion, cultured and exposed for 24 h at a concentration range varying from 31 nM to 10 mM 3-MMC. The modulatory effects of cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors on 3-MMC hepatotoxicity were evaluated. 3-MMC-induced toxicity was perceived at the lysosome at lower concentrations (NOEC 312. µM), compared to  (NOEC 379. µM) and cytoplasmic membrane (NOEC 1.04 mM). Inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 diminished 3-MMC cytotoxicity, yet for CYP2E1 inhibition this effect was only observed for concentrations up to 1.3 mM. A significant concentration-dependent increase of intracellular reactive species was observed from 10 μM 3-MMC on; a concentration-dependent decrease in antioxidant glutathione defences was also observed. At 10 μM, caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activities were significantly elevated, corroborating the activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. Nuclear morphology and formation of cytoplasmic acidic vacuoles suggest prevalence of necrosis and autophagy at concentrations higher than 10 μM. No significant alterations were observed in the mitochondrial membrane potential, but intracellular ATP significantly decreased at 100 μM.

SNK-6 cells were treated with 30μmol/L Z-VAD-FMK (Pan-caspase inhibitor)+3ng/mL bortezomib, and , 10 μmol/L BAY11-7082+3 ng/mL bortezomib for 24 h respectively, then the cell viability was measured by CCK8 kit. After treatment of SNK-6 cells with different mass concentrations of bortezomib for 24 h, apoptosis was detected by AnnexinⅤ/PI flow cytometry; the expression of apoptosis-related protein Caspase-3, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and Bcl-2 and NF-κB signaling pathway key proteins P65 and P100/P52 were detected by Western blot.Bortezomib inhibited the proliferation of SNK-6 cells in a dose-dependent manner ( <0.05), and IC ( (2.87±0.06) ng/mL) at 24 h was lower than that at 48 h and 72 h ( <0.05). BAY11-7082 also inhibited the proliferation of SNK-6 cells with an IC = (9.73±0.36) μmol/L at 24 h. The combination treatment indicated that Z-VAD-FMK could attenuate the inhibitory effect of bortezomib on the proliferation of SNK-6 cells ( <0.05), while BAY11-7082 could enhance the inhibitory effect of bortezomib on the proliferation of SNK-6 cells ( <0.05). After treatment of SNK-6 cells with bortezomib for 24 h, apoptosis-related protein Caspase-3 cleavage, PARP activation, and Bcl-2 cleavage; NF-κB signaling pathway-related protein P65 phosphorylation level decreased, and P52 decreased.Bortezomib inhibits ENKTL cells proliferation by inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway and induces apoptosis of ENKTL cells via -mediated caspase pathway.Copyright© by Editorial Board of Journal of Sichuan University (Medical Science Edition).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534333>Cuprous oxide nanoparticles reduces hypertrophic scarring by inducing fibroblast apoptosis.</a></h1><p>Less apoptosis and excessive growth of fibroblasts contribute to the progression of hypertrophic scar formation. Cuprous oxide nanoparticles (CONPs) could have not only inhibited tumor by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation of tumor cells, but also promoted wound healing. The objective of this study was to further explore the therapeutic effects of CONPs on hypertrophic scar formation in vivo and in vitro.In vivo, a rabbit ear scar model was established on New Zealand albino rabbits. Six full-thickness and circular wounds (10 mm diameter) were made to each ear. Following complete re-epithelization observed on postoperative day 14, an intralesional injection of CONPs or % glucose solution was conducted to the wounds. The photo and ultrasonography of each wound were taken every week and scars were harvested on day 35 for further histomorphometric analysis. In vitro, the role of CONPs in human hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (HSFs) apoptosis and proliferation were evaluated by Tunnel assay, Annexin V/PI staining, cell cycle analysis, and EdU proliferation assay. The endocytosis of CONPs by fibroblasts were detected through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS production were also detected.In vivo, intralesional injections of CONPs could significantly improve the scar appearance and collagen arrangement, and decreased scar elevation index (SEI). In vitro, CONPs could prominently inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in HSFs in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, CONPs could be endocytosed into ，damage the mitochondrial membrane potential and increase ROS production.CONPs possessed the therapeutic potential in the treatment of hypertrophic scar by inhibiting HSFs proliferation and inducing HSFs apoptosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31476841>A New Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor, MHY4381, Induces Apoptosis via Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.</a></h1><p>Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors represent a novel class of anticancer agents, which can be used to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in several types of cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the anticancer activity of MHY4381, a newly synthesized HDAC inhibitor, against human prostate cancer cell lines and compared its efficacy with that of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a well-known HDAC inhibitor. We assessed cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and other biological effects in the prostate cancer cells. We also evaluated a possible mechanism of MHY4381 on the apoptotic cell death pathway. The IC value of MHY4381 was lower in DU145 cells (IC=0.31 μM) than in LNCaP (IC=0.85 μM) and PC-3 cells (IC=.23 μM). In addition, the IC values of MHY4381 measured in this assay were significantly lower than those of SAHA against prostate cancer cell lines. MHY4381 increased the levels of acetylated histones H3 and H4 and reduced the expression of HDAC proteins in the prostate cancer cell lines. MHY4381 increased G2/M phase arrest in DU145 cells, and G1 arrest in LNCaP cells. It also activated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which induced apoptosis in the DU145 and LNCaP cells by increasing the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and releasing cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Our results indicated that MHY4381 preferentially results in antitumor effects in DU145 and LNCaP cells via -mediated apoptosis and ROS-facilitated cell death pathway, and therefore can be used as a promising prostate cancer therapeutic.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496037>Sodium hydrosulphide restores tumour necrosis factor-α-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic dysregulation in HL-1 cells.</a></h1><p>Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α induces cardiac metabolic disorder and mitochondrial dysfunction. Hydrogen sulphide (H S) contains anti-inflammatory and biological effects in cardiomyocytes. This study investigated whether H S modulates TNF-α-dysregulated mitochondrial function and metabolism in cardiomyocytes. HL-1 cells were incubated with TNF-α (25 ng/mL) with or without sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS, 0.1 mmol/L) for 24 hours. Cardiac peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms, pro-inflammatory cytokines, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and fatty acid metabolism were evaluated through Western blotting. The mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production were investigated using Seahorse XF24 extracellular flux analyzer and bioluminescence assay. Fluorescence intensity using 2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was used to evaluate mitochondrial oxidative stress. NaHS attenuated the impaired basal and maximal respiration, ATP production and ATP synthesis and enhanced mitochondrial oxidative stress in TNF-α-treated HL-1 cells. TNF-α-treated HL-1 cells exhibited lower expression of PPAR-α, PPAR-δ, phosphorylated ' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase-α2, phosphorylated acetyl CoA carboxylase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, PPAR-γ coactivator 1-α and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 protein, but higher expression of PPAR-γ, interleukin-6 and RAGE protein than control or combined NaHS and TNF-α-treated HL-1 cells. NaHS modulates the effects of TNF-α on  and the cardiometabolic system, suggesting its therapeutic potential for inflammation-induced cardiac dysfunction.© 2019 The Authors.

However, a large disparity in frequency of European  (27%) versus Y chromosomes (1%) left unclear the magnitude of genetic exchange. We sought to quantify genomic introgression using 35 autosomal and  X chromosome ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) in conjunction with diagnostic Y-SNP markers to characterize the modern state of red foxes in the eastern US and to gain insight into the potential role of reproductive barriers. European admixture was highest in the ACP and apparently restricted to the central eastern US. We estimated only slightly higher (and nonsignificantly) European ancestry in autosomal than X chromosome markers. European ancestry from autosomal and X chromosome markers (36.4%) was higher than the corresponding mtDNA estimate (26.4%) in the ACP. Only 1 of 124 males (<1%) in the ACP had European Y chromosomes, which was similar to the neighboring regions, in which 2 of 99 (2%) males carried a European Y chromosome (the same haplotype). Although we could not rule out drift as the cause of low European Y chromosome frequency, results were also consistent with F1 male infertility. In the future, more extensive genomic sequencing will enable a more thorough investigation of possible barrier genes on the X chromosome as well as throughout the genome.© The American Genetic Association 2019.

We measured oxygen consumption during a 2-h, strenuous exercise test; assessed the respiration of skeletal muscle ; and performed untargeted metabolomics on treated fish, with and without exercise.Nitrate and nitrite treatment increased blood nitrate and nitrite levels. Nitrate treatment significantly lowered the oxygen cost of exercise, as compared with pretreatment values. In contrast, nitrite treatment significantly increased oxygen consumption with exercise. Nitrate and nitrite treatments did not change mitochondrial function measured ex vivo, but significantly increased the abundances of ATP, ADP, lactate, glycolytic intermediates (e.g., fructose 1,6-bisphosphate), tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates (e.g., succinate), and ketone bodies (e.g., β-hydroxybutyrate) by 1.8- to 3.8-fold, relative to controls. Exercise significantly depleted glycolytic and TCA intermediates in nitrate- and nitrite-treated fish, as compared with their rested counterparts, while exercise did not change, or increased, these metabolites in control fish. There was a significant net depletion of fatty acids, acyl carnitines, and ketone bodies in exercised, nitrite-treated fish (2- to 4-fold), while exercise increased net fatty acids and acyl carnitines in nitrate-treated fish (1.- to 12-fold), relative to their treated and rested counterparts.Nitrate and nitrite treatment increased the availability of metabolic fuels (ATP, glycolytic and TCA intermediates, lactate, and ketone bodies) in rested zebrafish. Nitrate treatment may improve exercise performance, in part, by stimulating the preferential use of fuels that require less oxygen for energy production.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564869>Effect of 2nd and 3rd generation PAMAM dendrimers on proliferation, differentiation, and pro-inflammatory cytokines in human keratinocytes and fibroblasts.</a></h1><p>Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers are of considerable interest when used as a carrier for topical drugs for the skin, although little is known about their possible side effects. Therefore, our study was about the impact of 2nd and 3rd generation PAMAM dendrimers on human keratinocytes and fibroblasts cells.The effect of the tested compounds on collagen biosynthesis was determined using [H]-proline incorporation bioassay. Morphological changes accompanying cell growth inhibition were observed using a confocal microscope. To evaluate the percentage of apoptotic/necrotic cells and the cell growth dynamic of apoptotic features, we performed Annexin V/PI double staining assay, assessed caspase activity, and performed cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. The flow cytometry method was also used to determine the effect of dendrimers on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8 IL-1β).The obtained results showed that as the concentration and the generation of dendrimers increased, collagen biosynthesis decreased. We also observed abnormalities in cell differentiation, which may have caused disturbed secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We found that dendrimers cause chronic inflammation which may cause adverse changes in the skin, ultimately- leading to apoptosis in the case of dendrimers in lower concentrations or necrosis at higher concentrations (especially 3rd generation dendrimers). In addition, the inflammatory path induced by the tested compounds was caused by damage in the , which we observed as a significant decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential.The results of our study showed that PAMAM dendrimers can cause disorders of cell proliferation and differentiation and may be the cause of cell cycle deregulation and chronic adverse inflammation.© 2019 Czarnomysy et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547050>Functional Expression of Choline Transporters in the Blood-Brain Barrier.</a></h1><p>Cholinergic neurons in the central nervous system play a vital role in higher brain functions, such as learning and memory. Choline is essential for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine by cholinergic neurons. The synthesis and metabolism of acetylcholine are important mechanisms for regulating neuronal activity. Choline is a positively charged quaternary ammonium compound that requires transporters to pass through the plasma membrane. Currently, there are three groups of choline transporters with different characteristics, such as affinity for choline, tissue distribution, and sodium dependence. They include (I) polyspecific organic cation transporters (OCT1-3: SLC22A1-3) with a low affinity for choline, (II) high-affinity choline transporter 1 (CHT1: SLC5A7), and (III) choline transporter-like proteins (CTL1-: SLC44A1-). Brain microvascular endothelial cells, which comprise part of the blood-brain barrier, take up extracellular choline via intermediate-affinity choline transporter-like protein 1 (CTL1) and low-affinity CTL2 transporters. CTL2 is responsible for excreting a high concentration of choline taken up by the brain microvascular endothelial cells on the brain side of the blood-brain barrier. CTL2 is also highly expressed in  and may be involved in the oxidative pathway of choline metabolism. Therefore, CTL1- and CTL2-mediated choline transport to the brain through the blood-brain barrier plays an essential role in various functions of the central nervous system by acting as the rate-limiting step of cholinergic neuronal activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647942>The compartmentalised nature of the mechanisms governing superoxide formation and scavenging in cells exposed to arsenite.</a></h1><p>In this study, respiration-proficient (RP) and -deficient (RD) cells were exposed to 2. or 10 μM arsenite to generate superoxide (O) respectively in the mitochondrial respiratory chain or via NADPH oxidase activation. These treatments, while causing similar, although mitochondrial permeability transition-dependent (RP-cells) or independent (RD-cells), delayed apoptosis, surprisingly generated identical kinetics and levels of dihydrorhodamine oxidation, indicative of O formation. These similarities were attributable to the involvement of a common upstream event resulting in activation of the two O-generating systems, and to intrinsic features of the cells. Both mechanisms required an initial and sequential mobilization of Ca from the inositol-1,4,-trisphosphate receptor and the ryanodine receptor (RyR), with however different implications. The close contacts existing between the RyR and the  created optimal conditions for the Ca clearance, and the ensuing formation of O in RP-cell . Exposure to low concentrations of l-ascorbic acid (AA) transported by high affinity mechanisms in cells and , suppressed O formation. Much more Ca, and hence more arsenite, was necessary to promote NADPH oxidase activation in RD-cells, as a consequence of the cytosolic dilution and mitochondrial clearance of Ca. For the same reasons, an exposure to high concentrations of AA was required to suppress O formation under these conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Since  are a major source of ROS, it is vital to understand the involvement of these organelles in the pathogenesis of ROS-mediated conditions. Therefore, we investigated mitochondrial function and ROS production in cerebral blood vessels of 21-wk-old Zucker diabetic fatty obese rats and their lean controls. We have previously shown that in the early stages of insulin resistance, and short periods of type 2 diabetes mellitus, only mild differences exist in mitochondrial function. In the present study, we examined mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial protein expression, and ROS production in large-surface cerebral arteries. We used 21-wk-old animals exposed to peak glucose levels for 7 wk and compared them with our previous studies on younger diabetic animals. We found that the same segments of mitochondrial respiration (basal respiration and proton leak) were diminished in diabetic groups as they were in younger diabetic animals. Levels of rattin, a rat humanin analog, tended to decrease in the diabetic group but did not reach statistical significance ( = 0.08). Other mitochondrial proteins were unaffected, which might indicate the existence of compensatory mechanisms with extension of this relatively mild form of diabetes. Superoxide levels were significantly higher in large cerebral vessels of diabetic animals compared with the control group. In conclusion, prolonged dietary diabetes leads to stabilization, rather than deterioration, of metabolic status in the cerebral circulation, despite continued overproduction of ROS. We have characterized for the first time the dynamics of mitochondrial function during the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus with regard to mitochondrial respiration, protein expression, and reactive oxygen species production. In addition, this is the first measurement of rattin levels in the cerebral vasculature, which could potentially lead to novel treatment options.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566908>The coenzyme Q10 analog idebenone attenuates murine lupus by improving mitochondrial metabolism and reducing inflammation.</a></h1><p>A role for mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed in the immune dysregulation and organ damage characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Idebenone is a coenzyme Q10 synthetic quinone analog and an antioxidant that has been used in humans to treat diverse diseases where mitochondrial function is impaired. This study assessed if idebenone ameliorates murine lupus.Idebenone was administered orally to MRL/lpr mice at two different doses (either 1 or 1. g/kg diet) for 8 weeks. At peak disease activity, clinical, immunologic and metabolic parameters were analyzed and compared to untreated mice. Results were confirmed in the lupus-prone NZM2328 mouse model.In MRL/lpr mice, idebenone-treated mice showed significant attenuation in mortality (p<0.01) and in several features including glomerular inflammation and fibrosis (p<0.05) and renal function, in association with decreases in renal IL-17A and mature IL-18 expression. Levels of splenic proinflammatory cytokines and inflammasome-related genes were significantly decreased by idebenone, while no obvious toxicity was observed. Idebenone inhibited neutrophil extracellular trap formation in lupus mouse and human neutrophils. Idebenone also improved mitochondrial metabolism (30% increase in basal respiration and ATP production), reduced heart lipid peroxidation in half , and significantly improved endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. NZM2328 mice exposed to idebenone also displayed improvements in renal and systemic inflammation.Idebenone ameliorates murine lupus disease activity and organ damage severity supporting the hypothesis that agents that modulate mitochondrial biology may have a therapeutic role in SLE.© 2019, American College of Rheumatology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600406>Short versus prolonged freezing differentially impacts freeze-thaw injury in spinach leaves: mechanistic insights through metabolite profiling.</a></h1><p>Plant tissues subjected to short or prolonged freezing to a fixed sub-freezing temperature are expected to undergo similar freeze-desiccation but former causes substantially less injury than the latter. To gain metabolic insight into this differential response, metabolome changes in spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaves were determined following short-term (0. and 3.0 h) vs. prolonged freezing (. and 10. h) at -4.°C resulting in reversible or irreversible injury, respectively. LD , the freezing duration causing 50% injury, was estimated to be ~3.1 h, and defined as the threshold beyond which tissues were irreversibly injured. From 39 identified metabolites, 19 were selected and clustered into 3 groups: (1) signaling-related (salicylic acid, aliphatic and aromatic amino acids), (2) injury-related (GABA, lactic acid, maltose, fatty acids, policosanols, TCA intermediates), and (3) recovery-related (ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol). Initial accumulation of salicylic acid during short-term freezing followed by a decline may be involved in triggering tolerance mechanisms in moderately injured tissues, while its resurgence during prolonged freezing may signal programmed cell death. GABA accumulated with increasing freezing duration, possibly to serve as a 'pH-stat' against cytoplasmic acidification resulting from lactic acid accumulation.  seems to be more sensitive to prolonged freezing than chloroplast since TCA intermediates decreased after LD while salicylic acid and maltose, produced in chloroplast, accumulate even at 10.-h freezing. Fatty acids and policosanols accumulation with increasing freezing duration indicates greater injury to membrane lipids and epicuticular waxes. Ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol accumulated after short-term freezing, supposedly facilitating recovery while their levels decreased in irreversibly injured tissues.

However, the molecular mechanism involved in the progression of myocardial I/R injury is still unclear. The current study aimed to investigate the expression and function of microRNA (miR)-138 in the process of myocardial I/R injury. First, miR-138 expression levels were analyzed both in myocardium with I/R injury and control myocardium using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Then, the relationship between the levels of miR-138 and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1-α was also investigated using a luciferase reporter assay. Assessment of myocardial infarct size, measurements of serum myocardial enzymes and electron microscopy analysis were all utilized to analyse the effect of miR-138 on myocardial I/R injury. The authors of current study also used western blotting to examine the expression levels of the mitochondrial fission-related proteins dynamin-1-like protein and mitochondrial fission 1 protein. It was found that miR-138 is downregulated and HIF1-α is upregulated after myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury. Overexpression of miR-138 reduced myocardial I/R injury-induced infarct sizes and myocardial enzyme levels, and it also inhibited the expression of proteins related to mitochondrial morphology and myocardial I/R-induced mitochondrial apoptosis by targeting HIF1-α. Taken together, these findings provide a novel insight into the molecular mechanism of miR-138 and HIF1-α in the progression of myocardial I/R injury. miR-138 has the potential to become a promising therapeutic target for treating myocardial I/R injury.Copyright: © Liu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646321>Dual role of polyamines in heart ischemia/reperfusion injury through regulation of mitochondrial permeability transition pore.</a></h1><p>Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are essential polycations that play important roles in various physiological and pathophysiological processes in mammalian cells.

Isolated hearts from male Sprague-Dawley rats were Langendorff-perfused and cardiac I/R was achieved by 30 min of global ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion. Different concentrations of polyamines (0.1, 1, 10, and 15 μmol/L of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine), cyclosporin A (0.2 μmol/L), or atractyloside (20 μmol/L) were given 10 min before the onset of reperfusion. The hemodynamics were monitored; the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the coronary effluent were measured spectrophotometrically; infarct size was determined by the 2,3,-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining method; and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening was determined spectrophotometrically by the Ca-induced swelling of isolated cardiac . The results showed that compared to I/R alone, 0.1 and 1 μmol/L polyamines treatment improved heart function, reduced LDH release, decreased infarct size, and these effects were inhibited by atractyloside (MPTP activator). In isolated  from normal rats, 0.1 and 1 μmol/L polyamines treatment inhibited MPTP opening. However, 10 and 15 μmol/L polyamines treatment had the opposite effects, and these effects were inhibited by cyclosporin A (MPTP inhibitor).

A large part of these alterations is due to dysfunctional Ca-storing organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and . Very recently, lysosomal Ca dysfunction has emerged as an important pathological change leading to neuronal loss in ALS. Remarkably, the Ca-storing organelles are interacting with each other at specialized domains controlling mitochondrial dynamics, ER/lysosomal function, and autophagy. This occurs as a result of interaction between specific ionic channels and Ca-dependent proteins located in each structure. Therefore, the dysregulation of these ionic mechanisms could be considered as a key element in the neurodegenerative process. This review will focus on the possible role of lysosomal Ca dysfunction in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS and shed light on the possibility that specific lysosomal Ca channels might represent new promising targets for preventing or at least delaying neurodegeneration in ALS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31524681>What Does Reduced FDG Uptake Mean in High-Grade Gliomas?</a></h1><p>As well as in many others cancers, FDG uptake is correlated with the degree of malignancy in gliomas, that is, commonly high FDG uptake in high-grade gliomas. However, in clinical practice, it is not uncommon to observe high-grade gliomas with low FDG uptake. Our aim was to explore the tumor metabolism in 2 populations of high-grade gliomas presenting high or low FDG uptake.High-resolution magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was realized on tissue samples from 7 high-grade glioma patients with high FDG uptake and  high-grade glioma patients with low FDG uptake. Tumor metabolomics was evaluated from 42 quantified metabolites and compared by network analysis.Whether originating from astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, the high-grade gliomas with low FDG avidity represent a subgroup of high-grade gliomas presenting common characteristics: low aspartate, glutamate, and creatine levels, which are probably related to the impaired electron transport chain in ; high serine/glycine metabolism and so one-carbon metabolism; low glycerophosphocholine-phosphocholine ratio in membrane metabolism, which is associated with tumor aggressiveness; and finally negative MGMT methylation status.It seems imperative to identify this subgroup of high-grade gliomas with low FDG avidity, which is especially aggressive.

Here, we show that exercise training or muscle disuse alters mitochondrial membrane phospholipids including phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Addition of PE promoted, whereas removal of PE diminished, mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Unexpectedly, skeletal muscle-specific inhibition of -autonomous synthesis of PE caused respiratory failure because of metabolic insults in the diaphragm muscle. While mitochondrial PE deficiency coincided with increased oxidative stress, neutralization of the latter did not rescue lethality. These findings highlight the previously underappreciated role of mitochondrial membrane phospholipids in dynamically controlling skeletal muscle energetics and function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645953>Copy numbers of mitochondrial genes change during melon leaf development and are lower than the numbers of .</a></h1><p>Melon is a useful plant species for studying mitochondrial genetics because it contains one of the largest and structurally diverse mitochondrial genomes among all plant species and undergoes paternal transmission of . We used droplet digital (dd) PCR in combination with flow cytometric determination of nuclear DNA quantities to determine the absolute per-cell copy numbers of four mitochondrial genes (, , , and ) across four stages of melon leaf development. The copy numbers of these mitochondrial genes not only varied during leaf development but also differed among each other, and there was no correlation between the copy numbers of the mitochondrial genes and their transcript levels. The gene copy numbers varied from approximately 36.8 ± 4. ( copies in the 15th leaf) to approximately 82.9 ± .7 ( copies in the 9th leaf), while the mean number of  was approximately 416.6 ± 182.7 in the 15th leaf and 459.1 ± 228.2 in the 9th leaf. These observations indicate that the leaf cells of melon do not contain sufficient copies of mitochondrial genes to ensure that every mitochondrion possesses the entire mitochondrial genome. Given this cytological evidence, our results indicate that mtDNA in melon exists as a sub-genomic molecule rather than as a single-master circle and that the copy numbers of individual mitochondrial genes may vary greatly. An improved understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) controlling the relative prevalence and transmission of sub-genomic mtDNA molecules should provide insights into the continuity of the mitochondrial genome across generations.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590697>Germ plasm-related structures in marine medaka gametogenesis; novel sites of Vasa localization and the unique mechanism of germ plasm granule arising.</a></h1><p>Germ plasm, a cytoplasmic factor of germline cell differentiation, is suggested to be a perspective tool for in vitro meiotic differentiation. To discriminate between the: (1) germ plasm-related structures (GPRS) involved in meiosis triggering; and (2) GPRS involved in the germ plasm storage phase, we investigated gametogenesis in the marine medaka Oryzias melastigma. The GPRS of the mitosis-to-meiosis period are similar in males and females. In both sexes, five events typically occur: (1) turning of the primary Vasa-positive germ plasm granules into the Vasa-positive intermitochondrial cement (IMC); (2) aggregation of some  by IMC followed by arising of mitochondrial clusters; (3) intramitochondrial localization of IMC-originated Vasa; followed by (4) mitochondrial cluster degradation; and () intranuclear localization of Vasa followed by this protein entering the nuclei (gonial cells) and synaptonemal complexes (zygotene-pachytene meiotic cells). In post-zygotene/pachytene gametogenesis, the GPRS are sex specific; the Vasa-positive chromatoid bodies are found during spermatogenesis, but oogenesis is characterized by secondary arising of Vasa-positive germ plasm granules followed by secondary formation and degradation of mitochondrial clusters. A complex type of germ plasm generation, 'the follicle cell assigned germ plasm formation', was found in late oogenesis. The mechanisms discovered are recommended to be taken into account for possible reconstruction of those under in vitro conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668383>Metformin prevents the pathological browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue.</a></h1><p>Browning, the conversion of white adipose tissue (WAT) to a beige phenotype, has gained interest as a strategy to induce weight loss and improve insulin resistance in metabolic disorders. However, for hypermetabolic conditions stemming from burn trauma or cancer cachexia, browning is thought to contribute to energy wasting and supraphysiological nutritional requirements. Metformin's impact on this phenomenon and underlying mechanisms have not been explored.We used both a murine burn model and human ex vivo adipose explants to assess metformin and -aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)'s effects on the development of subcutaneous beige adipose. Enzymes involved in fat homeostasis and browning, as well as mitochondrial dynamics, were assessed to determine metformin's effects.Treatment with the biguanide metformin lowers lipolysis in beige fat by inducing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) independently of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation. Increased PP2A activity catalyzes the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser 79) and hormone sensitive lipase (Ser 660), thus promoting fat storage and the "whitening" of otherwise lipolytic beige adipocytes. Moreover, co-incubation of metformin with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid countered the anti-lipolytic effects of this biguanide in human adipose. Additionally, we show that metformin does not activate this pathway in the WAT of control mice and that AICAR sustains the browning of white adipose, offering further evidence that metformin acts independently of this cellular energy sensor.This work provides novel insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of metformin's therapeutic benefits and potential as an agent to reduce the lipotoxicity associated with hypermetabolism and adipose browning.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

They are the most commonly damaged organelles within dopaminergic neurons in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the importance of protecting neuronal  in PD patients, the detailed mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction during pathogenesis and pathophysiological progression of PD have not yet been elucidated. We investigated the protective action of fucoidan against the detrimental action of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium (MPP), a neurotoxin used to model PD, in the  of SH-SY5Y neural cells. Fucoidan increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α) and protected the cells from MPP-induced apoptosis by upregulating the ' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-PGC-1α axis. These effects were blocked by the silencing of the PGC-1α axis. These results indicated that fucoidan protects SH-SY5Y cells from mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death caused by MPP treatment, via the AMPK-PGC-1α axis. These findings also suggest that fucoidan could potentially be used as a therapeutic agent for PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31473860>Transition from C to proto-Kranz to C-C intermediate type in the genus Chenopodium (Chenopodiaceae).</a></h1><p>The Chenopodiaceae is one of the families including C species among eudicots. In this family, the genus Chenopodium is considered to include only C species. However, we report here a transition from C photosynthesis to proto-Kranz to C-C intermediate type in Chenopodium. We investigated leaf anatomical and photosynthetic traits of 15 species, of which 8 species showed non-Kranz anatomy and a CO compensation point (Γ) typical of C plants. However,  species showed proto-Kranz anatomy and a C-like Γ, whereas C. strictum showed leaf anatomy and a Γ typical of C-C intermediates. Chenopodium album accessions examined included both proto-Kranz and C-C intermediate types, depending on locality. Glycine decarboxylase, a key photorespiratory enzyme that is involved in the decarboxylation of glycine, was located predominantly in the mesophyll (M) cells of C species, in both M and bundle-sheath (BS) cells in proto-Kranz species, and exclusively in BS cells in C-C intermediate species. The M/BS tissue area ratio, number of chloroplasts and  per BS cell, distribution of these organelles to the centripetal region of BS cells, the degree of inner positioning (vacuolar side of chloroplasts) of  in M cells, and the size of BS  also changed with the change in glycine decarboxylase localization. All Chenopodium species examined were C-like regarding activities and amounts of C and C photosynthetic enzymes and δC values, suggesting that these species perform photosynthesis without contribution of the C cycle. This study demonstrates that Chenopodium is not a C genus and is valuable for studying evolution of C-C intermediates.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629068>Impairment of mitochondrial bioenergetics and permeability transition induction caused by major long-chain fatty acids accumulating in VLCAD deficiency in skeletal muscle as potential pathomechanisms of myopathy.</a></h1><p>cis--Tetradecenoic (cis-) and myristic (Myr) acids predominantly accumulate in patients affected by very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency. They commonly manifest myopathy with muscular pain and rhabdomyolysis, whose underlying mechanisms are poorly known. Thus, in the present study we investigated the effects of cis- and Myr on mitochondrial bioenergetics and Ca homeostasis in rat skeletal muscle. cis- and Myr decreased ADP-stimulated (state 3) and CCCP-stimulated (uncoupled) respiration, especially when  were supported by NADH-linked as compared to FADH-linked substrates. In contrast, these fatty acids increased resting respiration (state 4). Similar effects were observed in skeletal muscle fibers therefore validating the data obtained with isolated . Furthermore, cis- and Myr markedly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and Ca retention capacity that were avoided by cyclosporin A plus ADP and ruthenium red, indicating that cis- and Myr induce mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Finally, docosanoic acid did not disturb mitochondrial homeostasis, indicating selective effects for Myr and cis-. Taken together, our findings indicate that major long-chain fatty acids accumulating in VLCAD deficiency behave as metabolic inhibitors, uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and MPT inducers. It is presumed that these pathomechanisms contribute to the muscular symptoms and rhabdomyolysis observed in patients affected by VLCAD deficiency.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ALI was induced in the mice via the lateral tail vein injection of pure OA. The histopathological score of lung, lung wet-dry weight ratio and the protein content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were used as the evaluation indexes of ALI. Iron concentration, glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in the lung tissues were measured using corresponding assay kits. The ultrastructure of pulmonary cells was observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM), and the expression level of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) mRNA was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR). Protein expression levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), ferritin and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) in lung tissues were determined by Western blot. The results showed that histopathological scores of lung tissues, lung wet-dry weight ratio and protein in BALF in the OA group were higher than those of the control group. In the OA group, the  of pulmonary cells were shrunken, and the mitochondrial membrane was ruptured. The expression level of PTGS2 mRNA in the OA group was seven folds over that in the control group. Iron overload, GSH depletion and accumulation of MDA were observed in the OA group. Compared with the control group, the protein expression levels of GPX4 and ferritin in lung tissue were down-regulated in the OA group. These results suggest that ferroptosis plays a potential role in the pathogenesis of ALI in our mouse model, which may provide new insights for development of new drugs for ALI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31528696>Tafazzin modulates cellular phospholipid composition to regulate AML stemness.</a></h1><p>Tafazzin is a mitochondrial enzyme necessary for the remodeling of the phospholipid cardiolipin.

At the same time, from the standpoint of studying the mechanisms of primary prevention, it is very important not only to identify the overall adaptation effect, but also to have an idea on the specific contribution of a physical factor used in the development of adaptation.To identify metabolic and ultrastructural adaption parameters under the action of low-intensity UHF EMR on healthy animals and to determine their stability (safety), by using a model of radiation exposure.The experiments were carried on 42 mature male rats weighing 180-200g. All the rats were divided into  groups: 2 experimental groups of 8 animals each for the comparative study of the specific features of adaptation developed under the preliminary action of UHF EMR in healthy animals and under radiation; 2 control groups of 8 animals each, and one intact group of 10 animals. The lumbar region (the area of the projection of the adrenal glands) was exposed to UHF EMP for 2 min daily (a cycle of 10 sessions). The animals were once irradiated at 2 Gy Co gamma ray doses, by using an Agat-R apparatus. The investigation objects were the liver, adrenal glands, testes, and thymus. The investigators used biochemical assays (the levels of RNA and DNA, antioxidant activity, specific activity in the thymocyte genome), transmission electron microscopy of adrenocorticocytes in the adrenal bundle zone and Sertoli cells in the testis.  (number, average and total area, number of cristae) were morphometrically analyzed.The metabolic and ultrastructural adaption changes induced by UHF EMR in healthy animals were ascertained to be able to withstand the pathogenic effect of radiation and at the same time showed both stability (safety) and certain variability (plasticity) in their reactions. In this case, there were increases in the synthesis of nucleic acids and in the activity of the antioxidant system; there was also mitochondrial structural stability that was more manifested in the adrenocorticocytes in the adrenal bundle zone. At the same time, there was also a decrease in the intensity (magnitude) of a number of adaptive indicators, although by and large they were significantly higher than the level of control (the effect of radiation).Thus, the effect of UHF EMR on healthy animals contributed to the development of adaptive rearrangements in the organs studied. The essence of these changes was mainly the enhancement of synthetic reactions, as indicated by a larger amount of RNA and DNA, the activation of cellular and intracellular regeneration with the increased processes of hyperplasia of the mitochondrial cristae and the higher levels of ribosomes and polysomes. In addition, it can be assumed that the use of UHF EMR has laid the physicochemical foundations of its antioxidant action as conformational rearrangements in the membranes, which increased their structural stability. The findings are indicative of the increased level of morphofunctional reserves in the studied cells and tissues due to their increased bioenergetic and plastic potential.This study has provided new data that expand our understanding of the features of the development of adaptive mechanisms and the formation of the body's structural and functional reserves under the primary prophylactic action of low-intensity UHF EMR, by using the model of radiation exposure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603468>SubMito-XGBoost: predicting protein submitochondrial localization by fusing multiple feature information and eXtreme gradient boosting.</a></h1><p> are an essential organelle in most eukaryotes. They not only play an important role in energy metabolism but also take part in many critical cytopathological processes. Abnormal  can trigger a series of human diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, multifactor disorder, and Type-II diabetes. Protein submitochondrial localization enables the understanding of protein function in studying disease pathogenesis and drug design.We proposed a new method, SubMito-XGBoost, for protein submitochondrial localization prediction. Three steps are included: (i) the g-gap dipeptide composition (g-gap DC), pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC), auto-correlation function (ACF), and Bi-gram position-specific scoring matrix (Bi-gram PSSM) are employed to extract protein sequence features, (ii) Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is used to balance samples, and the ReliefF algorithm is applied for feature selection, and (iii) the obtained feature vectors are fed into XGBoost to predict protein submitochondrial locations. SubMito-XGBoost has obtained satisfactory prediction results by the leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) compared with existing methods. The prediction accuracies of the SubMito-XGBoost method on the two training datasets M317 and M983 were 97.7% and 98.9%, which are 2.8-12.% and 3.8-9.9% higher than other methods, respectively. The prediction accuracy of the independent test set M495 was 94.8%, which is significantly better than the existing studies. The proposed method also achieves satisfactory predictive performance on plant and non-plant protein submitochondrial datasets. SubMito-XGBoost also plays an important role in new drug design for the treatment of related diseases.The source codes and data are publicly available at https://github.com/QUST-AIBBDRC/SubMito-XGBoost/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author(s) (2019).

This undesirable outcome may be due to some hidden factors that can intensify the consequences of AKI. Exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), a universal chemical used in plastics industry, is currently unavoidable and can be harmful to the liver. This study explored whether BPA exposure could be a causative factor that increase severity of remote liver injury after AKI and examined the preventive benefit by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in this complex condition. Male Wistar rats were given vehicle, BPA, or BPA + NAC for  weeks then underwent 45 min renal ischemia followed by 24 h reperfusion (RIR), a group of vehicle-sham-control was also included. RIR not only induced AKI but produced liver injury, triggered systemic oxidative stress as well as inflammation, which increasing severity upon exposure to BPA. Given NAC to BPA-exposed rats diminished the added-on effects of BPA on liver functional impairment, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis caused by AKI. NAC also mitigated the abnormalities in mitochondrial functions, dynamics, mitophagy, and ultrastructure of the liver by improving the mitochondrial homeostasis regulatory signaling AMPK-PGC-1α-SIRT3. The study demonstrates that NAC is an effective adjunct for preserving mitochondrial homeostasis and reducing remote effects of AKI in environments where BPA exposure is vulnerable.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620663>Brief overview: Protective roles of astrocyte-derived pentraxin-3 in blood-brain barrier integrity.</a></h1><p>Stroke is one of the world's leading causes of mortality and morbidity. Greater understanding is required of the underlying relationships in ischemic brains in order to prevent stroke or to develop effective treatment. This review highlights new findings about the relationship of blood-brain barrier with astrocytes, pentraxin-3 (PTX3), and other factors expressed during or after ischemic stroke. These are discussed with respect to their ameliorative or deleterious effects. These effects are measured  in animal models as well as  in cell cultures. Evidence was found to suggest that astrocytes play a key role in stroke by expressing PTX3, which, in turn, enhances endothelial tightness, increases tight junction proteins, and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor. The role of astrocytes and PTX3 is examined in relation to hypoxic stress and conditioning as well as mitochondrial transfer.

To investigate the combined effects of Mo and Cd on oxidative stress and mitochondrial apoptosis in primary duck renal tubular epithelial cells, the cells were either treated with (NH)MoO·4HO (480, 960 μM Mo), 3CdSO·8HO (2., .0 μM Cd) or combination of Mo and Cd for 12 h, and then the joint cytotoxicity was evaluated. The results demonstrated that Mo or/and Cd exposure could induce release of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase, reactive oxygen species generation, acidification, increase levels of malondialdehyde and [Ca]i, decrease levels of glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant capacity, Na/K-ATPase, Ca-ATPase, and mitochondrial membrane potential; upregulate mRNA levels of Caspase-3, Bak-1, Bax, and cytochrome C, inhibit Bcl-2 mRNA level, and induce cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the changes of these indicators in co-treated groups were more remarkable. The results indicated that exposure to Mo or/and Cd could induce oxidative stress and apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway in duck renal tubular epithelial cells and the two metals may have a synergistic effect.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The 13 constituent respiratory chain proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome (namely, mtDNA) play essential roles. We found that in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, 11 of the 13 mtDNA-encoded genes exhibited decreased mRNA levels and  genes displayed decreased protein levels, including the cytochrome B (mt-CYB) and cytochrome C oxidase II (mt-CO2) genes. Mitochondrial gene sequencing revealed abnormalities in the levels of a large number of mitochondrial miRNAs (mitomiRs). MicroRNA-181a-5p (mir-181a-5p), which potentially targets genes encoding mt-CYB and mt-CO2 protein, was screened out from 549 downregulated mitomiRs via bioinformatic analysis. After overexpression of mitomiR-181a-5p, mt-CYB and mt-CO2 levels were reduced in HCC cells, and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) maintained by the electron transport chain (ETC) was decreased. Furthermore, the expression of hexokinase 2 (HK2) and glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) was upregulated, accompanied by elevated glucose, lactic acid release, and activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In vivo experiments confirmed that constitutive mitomiR-181a-5p expression caused reprogramming of glucose metabolism and promoted tumor growth and early lung metastasis in liver cancer. In summary, the present study reveals the important role of mitomiRs in glucose metabolism reprogramming in liver cancer, which is of considerable value in exploring new therapeutic targets for HCC.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, to date, the OS in peripheral lymphocytes and its contribution to the disease remain unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the influence of OS in peripheral lymphocytes of MS patients. To that end, a cross-sectional, observational pilot study was conducted [ = 58: 34 MS and 24 healthy subjects (control group)]. We have measured superoxide production and protein mitochondrial complex levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from MS patients and control. Lactate levels and the antioxidant capacity were determined in plasma. We adjusted the comparisons between study groups by age, sex and cell count according to case. Results demonstrated that PBMCs, specifically T cells, from MS patients exhibited significantly increased superoxide anion production compared to control group ( = 0.027 and  = 0.041, respectively). Increased superoxide production in PBMCs was maintained after the adjustment ( = 0.044). Regarding mitochondrial proteins, we observe a significant decrease in the representative protein content of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I-V in PBMCs of MS patients ( = 0.002,  = 0.037,  = 0.03,  = 0.044, and  = 0.051, respectively), which was maintained for complexes I, III, and V after the adjustment ( = 0.026;  = 0.033;  = 0.033, respectively).

This might be indicative of compromised mitochondrial function.

Sham, n= 12; ICH, n=9; GSH 50, n=10; GSH 100, n=10; GSH 200, n=11) in addition to significantly reduced mortality rate (p =0.2632, GSH 200 vs ICH. n = 12 per group) and damage volume (p < 0.05, GSH 200 vs ICH. n = 12 per group). GSH treatment also attenuated injury measured by decreased brain edema (p < 0.05, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 10; ICH, n=10; GSH 200, n=12), blood-brain barrier disruption (p < 0.05, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 10; ICH, n=10; GSH 200, n=12), and histopathological damage (p < 0.05, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 6; ICH, n= 6; GSH 200, n=8) 72 h after ICH. In addition, GSH treatment also decreased cell apoptosis (p < 0.01, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 6; ICH, n= 6; GSH 200, n=8) and resulted in up-regulated protein expression of complex I (p < 0.01, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 6; ICH, n= 6; GSH 200, n=8), which was consistent with an overall up-regulation of complex I function in  using Oxygraph-2K high resolution respirometry (p < 0.05, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 4; ICH, n= ; GSH 200, n=6). In conclusion, GSH effectively improved the prognosis of ICH mice by attenuating neurological impairment, decreasing neural damage, and inhibiting apoptosis. The neuroprotection by GSH resulted from the up-regulation of mitochondrial oxidative respiration function. The results of our study suggest that GSH can be a potential therapeutic agent for ICH.Copyright © 2019.

Populations of mtDNA molecules exist in most eukaryotic cells, subject to replication, degradation, mutation, and other population processes. These processes affect the genetic makeup of cellular mtDNA populations, changing cell-to-cell distributions, means, and variances of mutant mtDNA load over time. As mtDNA mutant load has nonlinear effects on cell functionality, and cell functionality has nonlinear effects on tissue performance, these statistics of cellular mtDNA populations play vital roles in health, disease, and inheritance. This mini review will describe some of the better-known ways in which these populations change over time in different organisms, highlighting the importance of quantitatively understanding both mutant load mean and variance. Due to length constraints, we cannot attempt to be comprehensive but hope to provide useful links to some of the many excellent studies on these topics.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534623>Antioxidant and Cardioprotective Effects of EPA on Early Low-Severity Sepsis through UCP3 and SIRT3 Upholding of the Mitochondrial Redox Potential.</a></h1><p>Sepsis still causes death, often through cardiac failure and mitochondrial dysfunction. Dietary 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are known to protect against cardiac dysfunction and sepsis lethality. This study set out to determine whether early low-severity sepsis alters the cardiac mitochondrial function in animals fed a Western-type diet and whether dietary eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) administration protects the myocardium against the deleterious effects of sepsis and if so to seek possible mechanisms for its effects. Rats were divided into two groups fed either an 3 PUFA-deficient diet ("Western diet," DEF group) or an EPA-enriched diet (EPA group) for  weeks. Each group was subdivided into two subgroups: sham-operated rats and rats subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP).  cardiac mechanical function was examined, and  were harvested to determine their functional activity. Oxidative stress was evaluated together with several factors involved in the regulation of reactive oxygen species metabolism. Sepsis had little effect on cardiac mechanical function but strongly depressed mitochondrial function in the DEF group. Conversely, dietary EPA greatly protected the  through a decreased oxidative stress of the mitochondrial matrix. The latter was probably due to an increased uncoupling protein-3 expression, already seen in the sham-operated animals. CLP rats in the EPA group also displayed increased mitochondrial sirtuin-3 protein expression that could reinforce the upholding of oxidative phosphorylation. Dietary EPA preconditioned the heart against septic damage through several modifications that protect mitochondrial integrity. This preconditioning can explain the cardioprotective effect of dietary EPA during sepsis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615696>Design, synthesis and evaluation of structurally diverse chrysin-chromene-spirooxindole hybrids as anticancer agents.</a></h1><p>A series of structurally diverse chrysin-chromene-spirooxindole hybrids were designed, synthesized via a Knoevenagel/Michael/cyclization of chrysin and isatylidene malononitrile derivatives through utilizing a hybrid pharmacophore approach. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro anticancer activity, and most of the compounds showed stronger anti-proliferative activity than parent compound chrysin. In particular, compound 3e had the highest cytotoxicity towards A549 cells (IC = 3.15 ± 0.51 μM), and had better selectivity in A549 cells and normal MRC- cells. Furthermore, compound 3e could significantly inhibit the proliferation and migration of A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner, as well as induce the apoptosis possibly through -mediated caspase-3/8/9 activation and multi-target co-regulation of the p53 signaling pathway. Thus, our results provide in vitro evidence that compound 3e may be a potential candidate for the development of new anti-tumour drugs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Presently, scientists are developing other metal drugs as an alternative of cisplatin. In this paper, three new iridium(III) complexes [Ir(ppy)(adppz)](PF) (adppz = 7-aminodipyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-c]phenazine; ppy = 2-phenylpyridine 1), [Ir(bzq)(adppz)](PF) (bzq = benzo[h]quinolone 2) and [Ir(piq)(adppz)](PF) (piq = 1-phenylisoquinoline 3) were synthesized and characterized. The complexes can effectively inhibit the cell colonies. The cytotoxicity in vitro of the complexes against A549, HepG2, SGC-7901, BEL-7402 and normal NIH3T3 cells was evaluated by 3-(4,-dimethylthiazole)-2,-diphenyltetraazolium bromide (MTT) methods. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and Ca concentrations were assayed. The mitochondrial membrane potential, a release of cytochrome c and the expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) family protein have been investigated. The data reveal that the complexes 1-3 can effectively inhibit the cell proliferation in A549 cells with low IC value of 3.2 ± 0.4 μM, 4.8 ± 0. μM and 1.2 ± 0.2 μM, respectively. The antitumor in vivo shows that complex 3 can inhibit tumor growth with an inhibitory rate of 76.34%. The studies on the mechanism indicate that these complexes cause apoptosis in A549 cell via a ROS-mediated lysosomal-mitochondrial dysfunction pathway. In addition, the interaction of the complexes with BSA was explored.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This ablates the bactericidal capacities of phagocytes through massive and unregulated conversion of cytosolic ATP into the key signaling molecule cAMP. We show that exposure of primary human monocytes to as low a concentration as 22. pM CyaA, or a low (2:1) multiplicity of infection by CyaA-producing  bacteria, blocks macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-driven differentiation of monocytes. CyaA-induced cAMP signaling mediated through the activity of protein kinase A (PKA) efficiently blocked expression of macrophage markers, and the monocytes exposed to 22. pM CyaA failed to acquire the characteristic intracellular complexity of mature macrophage cells. Neither M-CSF-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) expansion nor accumulation of Golgi bodies, , or lysosomes was observed in toxin-exposed monocytes, which remained small and poorly phagocytic and lacked pseudopodia. Exposure to 22. pM CyaA toxin provoked loss of macrophage marker expression on  differentiated macrophages, as well as on primary human alveolar macrophages, which appeared to dedifferentiate into monocyte-like cells with upregulated CD14 levels.

We reveal a novel mechanism of potential subversion of host immunity, where CyaA at very low (22 pM) concentrations could inhibit maturation of human monocyte precursors into the more phagocytic macrophage cells. Furthermore, exposure to low CyaA amounts has been shown to trigger dedifferentiation of mature primary human alveolar macrophages back into monocyte-like cells. This unprecedented capacity is likely to promote survival of the pathogen in the airways, both by preventing maturation of monocytes attracted to the site of infection into phagocytic macrophages and by dedifferentiation of the already airway-resident sentinel cells.Copyright © 2019 Ahmad et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31508938>Heterochiral Assembly of Amphiphilic Peptides Inside the  for Supramolecular Cancer Therapeutics.</a></h1><p>Self-assembly of peptides containing both l- and d-isomers often results in nanostructures with enhanced properties compared to their enantiomeric analogues, such as faster kinetics of formation, higher mechanical strength, and enzymatic stability. However, occurrence and consequences of the heterochiral assembly in the cellular microenvironment are unknown. In this study, we monitored heterochiral assembly of amphiphilic peptides inside the cell, specifically  of cancer cells, resulting in nanostructures with refined morphological and biological properties owing to the superior interaction between the backbones of opposite chirality. We have designed a  penetrating tripeptide containing a diphenyl alanine building unit, named as Mito-FF due to their  targeting ability. The short peptide amphiphile, Mito-FF co-assembled with its mirror pair, Mito-ff, induced superfibrils of around 100 nm in diameter and 0.-1 μm in length, while enantiomers formed only narrow fibers of 10 nm in diameter.

These pathological conditions make  of a particular interest in the regulation of cell function and death by both apoptosis and autophagy. Therefore, this work was undertaken to investigate  function, autophagy and apoptosis protein markers in the kidney from rat model of intra-abdominal obesity and renal damage induced by high sucrose diet.  from sucrose fed (SF) kidney in the presence of pyruvate/malate generated hydrogen peroxide (HO) at a higher rate than from control (79.81 ± 4.98 vs 65.84 ± 1.95 pmol/min/mg protein). With succinate, the release of HO was significantly higher compared with pyruvate/malate and it remained higher in SF than in control  (146.4 ± 8.8 vs 106.1 ± .9 pmol/min/mg protein). However, cytochrome c release from SF kidney  was lower than from control. In addition, cardiolipin, a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid was found increased in SF  due to the enhanced amount of both cardiolipin synthase and tafazzin. Cardiolipin was also found enriched with saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids which are less susceptible to peroxidative stress involved in cytochrome c release. Furthermore, Beclin-1, LC3-B, as autophagy protein markers, and caspase 9 as apoptosis protein marker, were found decreased in SF kidney. These results suggest that the decline of autophagy protein markers and the lack of apoptosis process could be a pathological mechanism of cell dysfunction leading to the progression of renal disease in SF rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496874>Profiling of remote skeletal muscle gene changes resulting from stimulation of atopic dermatitis disease in NC/Nga mouse model.</a></h1><p>Although atopic dermatitis (AD) is known to be a representative skin disorder, it also affects the systemic immune response. In a recent study, myoblasts were shown to be involved in the immune regulation, but the roles of muscle cells in AD are poorly understood. We aimed to identify the relationship between  and atopy by genome-wide analysis of skeletal muscles in mice. We induced AD-like symptoms using house dust mite (HDM) extract in NC/Nga mice. The transcriptional profiles of the untreated group and HDM-induced AD-like group were analyzed and compared using microarray, differentially expressed gene and functional pathway analyses, and protein interaction network construction. Our microarray analysis demonstrated that immune response-, calcium handling-, and mitochondrial metabolism-related genes were differentially expressed. In the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology pathway analyses, immune response pathways involved in cytokine interaction, nuclear factor-kappa B, and T-cell receptor signaling, calcium handling pathways, and  metabolism pathways involved in the citrate cycle were significantly upregulated. In protein interaction network analysis, chemokine family-, muscle contraction process-, and immune response-related genes were identified as hub genes with many interactions. In addition, mitochondrial pathways involved in calcium signaling, cardiac muscle contraction, tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidation-reduction process, and calcium-mediated signaling were significantly stimulated in KEGG and Gene Ontology analyses. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the genome-wide transcriptional changes of HDM-induced AD-like symptoms and the indicated genes that could be used as AD clinical biomarkers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546260>Epigenetic Modifications Compromise Mitochondrial DNA Quality Control in the Development of Diabetic Retinopathy.</a></h1><p>Diabetes causes dysfunction in the retinal  and increases base mismatches in their DNA (mtDNA). The enzyme responsible for repairing the base mismatches, MutL homolog 1 (Mlh1), is compromised. Diabetes also favors many epigenetic modifications and activates DNA methylation machinery, and Mlh1 has a CpG-rich promoter. Our aim is to identify the molecular mechanism responsible for impaired mtDNA mismatch repair in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.Human retinal endothelial cells, incubated in 20 mM glucose, were analyzed for mitochondrial localization of Mlh1 by an immunofluorescence technique, Mlh1 promoter DNA methylation by the methylated DNA capture method, and the binding of Dnmt1 and transcriptional factor Sp1 by chromatin immunoprecipitation. The results were confirmed in retinal microvessels from streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, with or without Dnmt inhibitors, and from human donors with diabetic retinopathy.Compared with cells in  mM glucose, high glucose decreased Mlh1 mitochondrial localization, and its promoter DNA was hypermethylated with increased Dnmt-1 binding and decreased Sp1 binding. Dnmt inhibitors attenuated Mlh1 promoter hypermethylation and prevented a decrease in its gene transcripts and an increase in mtDNA mismatches. The administration of Dnmt inhibitors in mice ameliorated a diabetes-induced increase in Mlh1 promoter hypermethylation and a decrease in its gene transcripts. Similar decreases in Mlh1 gene transcripts and its promoter DNA hypermethylation were observed in human donors.Thus, as a result of the epigenetic modifications of the Mlh1 promoter, its transcription is decreased, and decreased mitochondrial accumulation fails to repair mtDNA mismatches. Therapies targeted to halt DNA methylation have the potential to prevent/halt mtDNA damage and the development of diabetic retinopathy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570704>Dissociation of mitochondrial HK-II elicits mitophagy and confers cardioprotection against ischemia.</a></h1><p>Preservation of mitochondrial integrity is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Mitophagy is a -specific type of autophagy which eliminates damaged  thereby contributing to mitochondrial quality control. Depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential is an established mechanism for inducing mitophagy, mediated through PINK1 stabilization and Parkin recruitment to . Hexokinase-II (HK-II) which catalyzes the first step in glucose metabolism, also functions as a signaling molecule to regulate cell survival, and a significant fraction of cellular HK-II is associated with  (mitoHK-II). We demonstrate here that pharmacological interventions and adenoviral expression of a mitoHK-II dissociating peptide which reduce mitoHK-II levels lead to robust increases in mitochondrial Parkin and ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins in cardiomyocytes and in a human glioblastoma cell line 1321N1, independent of mitochondrial membrane depolarization or PINK1 accumulation. MitoHK-II dissociation-induced mitophagy was demonstrated using Mito-Keima in cardiomyocytes and in 1321N1 cells. Subjecting cardiomyocytes or the in vivo heart to ischemia leads to modest dissociation of mitoHK-II. This response is potentiated by expression of the mitoHK-II dissociating peptide, which increases Parkin recruitment to  and, importantly, provides cardioprotection against ischemic stress. These results suggest that mitoHK-II dissociation is a physiologically relevant cellular event that is induced by ischemic stress, the enhancement of which protects against ischemic damage. The mechanism which underlies the effects of mitoHK-II dissociation can be attributed to the ability of Bcl2-associated athanogene  (BAG5), an inhibitor of Parkin, to localize to  and form a molecular complex with HK-II. Overexpression of BAG5 attenuates while knockdown of BAG5 sensitizes the effect of mitoHK-II dissociation on mitophagy. We suggest that HK-II, a glycolytic molecule, can function as a sensor for metabolic derangements at  to trigger mitophagy, and modulating the intracellular localization of HK-II could be a novel way of regulating mitophagy to prevent cell death induced by ischemic stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649854>Actively priming autophagic cell death with novel transferrin receptor-targeted nanomedicine for synergistic chemotherapy against breast cancer.</a></h1><p>Recently, considerable attention in the field of cancer therapy has been focused on the mammalian rapamycin target (mTOR), inhibition of which could result in autophagic cell death (ACD). Though novel combination chemotherapy of autophagy inducers with chemotherapeutic agents is extensively investigated, nanomedicine-based combination therapy for ACD remains in infancy. In attempt to actively trigger ACD for synergistic chemotherapy, here we incorporated autophagy inducer rapamycin (RAP) into 7pep-modified PEG-DSPE polymer micelles (7pep-M-RAP) to specifically target and efficiently priming ACD of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells with high expression of transferrin receptor (TfR). Cytotoxic paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded micelle (7pep-M-PTX) was regarded as chemotherapeutic drug model. We discovered that with superior intracellular uptake  and more tumor accumulation of micelles , 7pep-M-RAP exhibited excellent autophagy induction and synergistic antitumor efficacy with 7pep-M-PTX. Mechanism study further revealed that 7pep-M-RAP and 7pep-M-PTX used in combination provided enhanced efficacy through induction of both apoptosis- and -associated autophagic cell death. Together, our findings suggested that the targeted excess autophagy may provide a rational strategy to improve therapeutic outcome of breast cancer, and simultaneous induction of ACD and apoptosis may be a promising anticancer modality.© 2019 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which particulate matter 2. (PM) induces damage in human HaCaT keratinocytes and normal human dermal fibroblasts, and to evaluate the preventive capacity of the ginsenoside Rb1. PM induced oxidative stress by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species, leading to DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonylation; this effect was inhibited by ginsenoside Rb1. Through gene silencing of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes such as , , , and , and through the use of the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), it was demonstrated that PM-induced ER stress also causes apoptosis and ultimately leads to cell death; however, this phenomenon was reversed by ginsenoside Rb1. We also found that TUDCA partially restored the production of ATP that was inhibited by PM, and its recovery ability was significantly higher than that of ginsenoside Rb1, indicating that the process of ER stress leading to cell damage may also occur via the mitochondrial pathway. We concluded that ER stress acts alone or via the mitochondrial pathway in the induction of cell damage by PM, and that ginsenoside Rb1 blocks this process. Ginsenoside Rb1 shows potential for use in skin care products to protect the skin against damage by fine particles.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520279>A Novel PET Probe for Brown Adipose Tissue Imaging in Rodents.</a></h1><p>Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has emerged as a promising target to counteract obesity and its associated metabolic disorders. However, the detection of this tissue remains one of the major roadblocks.In this study, we assess the use of BODIPY 1 as a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent to image BAT depots in vivo in two mouse phenotypes: obesity-resistant BALB/c mice and the obesity-prone C57BL/6 mice. [F]BODIPY 1 is a radioactive dye that processed both radioactivity for PET imaging and fluorescence signal for in vitro mechanism study.Through the co-staining of cancer cells with BODIPY 1 and MitoTracker, we found BODIPY 1 mainly accumulated in cell  in vitro. Fluorescence imaging of primary brown and white adipocytes further confirmed BODIPY 1 had significantly higher accumulation in primary brown adipocytes compared with primary white adipocytes. We evaluated [F]BODIPY 1 for BAT imaging in both obesity-resistant BALB/c mice and obesity-prone C57BL/6 mice. Indeed, [F]BODIPY 1 was efficiently taken up by BAT in both mouse genotypes (6.40 ± 1.98 %ID/g in obesity-resistant BALB/c mice (n = 8) and .37 ± 0.82 %ID/g in obesity-prone C57BL/6 mice (n = 7)). Although norepinephrine stimulation could increase the absolute BAT uptake, the enhancement is not significant in both genotypes (p > 0.05) at current sample size. These results suggest BAT uptake of [F]BODIPY 1 may be independent of BAT thermogenic activity. As a comparison, 2-deoxy-2-[F]fluoro-D-glucose ([F]FDG) PET imaging was performed in obesity-resistant BALB/c mice. Significantly increased uptake was observed in adrenergically activated BAT (10.08 ± 2.52 %ID/g, n = 3) but not in inactive BAT (3.803 ± 0.70 %ID/g; n = 3). Because [F]BODIPY 1 maintained its fluorescent property, BAT tissue was excised and studied using fluorescence microscopy. Strong fluorescence signal was observed in BAT mouse that was injected with BODIPY 1.Unlike [F]FDG, [F]BODIPY 1 showed prominent accumulation in BAT under both inactive and stimulated status. [F]BODIPY 1 may serve as a valuable BAT PET agent to possibly assess BAT  density, thus BAT thermogenic capacity after further evaluation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471036>Aging-independent and size-dependent genotoxic response induced by titanium dioxide nanoparticles in mammalian cells.</a></h1><p>Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO NPs) are subjected to various transformation processes (chemical, physical and biological processes) in the environment, potentially affecting their bioavailability and toxic properties. However, the size variation of TiO NPs during aging process and subsequent effects in mammalian cells are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to illustrate the adverse effects of TiO NPs in different sizes (, 15 and <100 nm) during aging process on human-hamster hybrid (A) cells. There was an aging-time dependent enhancement of average hydrodynamic size in TiO NPs stock suspensions. The cytotoxicity of fresh TiO NPs increased in a size-dependent manner; in contrast, their genotoxicity decreased with the increasing sizes of NPs. No significant toxicity difference was observed in cells exposed to either fresh or 60 day-aged TiO NPs. Both Fresh and aged TiO NPs efficiently induced mitochondrial dysfunction and activated Caspase-3/7 in a size-dependent manner. Using mitochondrial-DNA deficient (ρ) A cells, we further discovered that mitochondrial dysfunction made significant contribution to the size-dependent toxicity induced by TiO NPs during the aging process. Taken together, our data indicated that TiO NPs could significantly induced the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in an aging time-independent and size-dependent manner, which were triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction. Our study suggested the necessity to include size as an additional parameter for the cautious monitoring of TiO NPs disposal before entering the environment.Copyright © 2019.

Either prevention of differentiation or promotion of de-differentiation could mitigate CF-related pathologies. We determined whether 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors-statins, commonly prescribed to patients at risk of heart failure (HF)-can de-differentiate myofibroblasts, alter cellular bioenergetics, and impact the human ventricular fibroblasts (hVFs) in HF patients.Either in vitro statin treatment of differentiated myofibroblasts (n = 3-6) or hVFs, isolated from human HF patients under statin therapy (HF + statin) vs. without statins (HF) were randomly used (n = 4-12). In vitro, hVFs were differentiated by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) for 72 h (TGF-72 h). Differentiation status and cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were determined by α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and Seahorse assay, respectively. Data are mean ± SEM except Seahorse (mean ± SD); P < 0.05, considered significant. In vitro, statins concentration-dependently de-differentiated the myofibroblasts. The respective half-maximal effective concentrations were 729 ± 13 nmol/L (atorvastatin), 3.6 ± 1 μmol/L (rosuvastatin), and 185 ± 13 nmol/L (simvastatin). Mevalonic acid (300 μmol/L), the reduced product of HMG-CoA, prevented the statin-induced de-differentiation (α-SMA expression: 31.4 ± 10% vs. 58.6 ± 12%). Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP, 20 μmol/L), a cholesterol synthesis-independent HMG-CoA reductase pathway intermediate, completely prevented the statin-induced de-differentiation (α-SMA/GAPDH ratios: 0.89 ± 0.05 [TGF-72 h + 72 h], 0.63 ± 0.02 [TGF-72 h + simvastatin], and 1.2 ± 0.08 [TGF-72 h + simvastatin + GGPP]). Cellular metabolism involvement was observed when co-incubation of simvastatin (200 nmol/L) with glibenclamide (10 μmol/L), a K channel inhibitor, attenuated the simvastatin-induced de-differentiation (0.84 ± 0.05). Direct inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by oligomycin (1 ng/mL) also produced a de-differentiation effect (0.33 ± 0.02). OCR (pmol O /min/μg protein) was significantly decreased in the simvastatin-treated hVFs, including basal (P = 0.002), ATP-linked (P = 0.01), proton leak-linked (P = 0.01), and maximal (P < 0.001). The OCR inhibition was prevented by GGPP (basal OCR [P = 0.02], spare capacity OCR [P = 0.008], and maximal OCR [P = 0.003]). Congruently, hVFs from HF showed an increased population of myofibroblasts while HF + statin group showed significantly reduced cellular respiration (basal OCR [P = 0.021], ATP-linked OCR [P = 0.047], maximal OCR [P = 0.02], and spare capacity OCR [P = 0.025]) and myofibroblast differentiation (α-SMA/GAPDH: 1 ± 0.19 vs. 0.23 ± 0.06, P = 0.01).This study demonstrates the de-differentiating effect of statins, the underlying GGPP sensitivity, reduced OCR with potential activation of K channels, and their impact on the differentiation magnitude of hVFs in HF patients. This novel pleiotropic effect of statins may be exploited to reduce excessive CF in patients at risk of HF.© 2019 The Authors.

Protein expressions of brown adipocyte markers were determined through high content screening analysis and validated through western blotting. Mito Stress Test assay was conducted to evaluate the cellular oxygen consumption rate upon A. bilimbi treatment.A. bilimbi ethanolic leaf extract exhibited an adipogenesis effect similar to a PPARgamma agonist. It also demonstrated brown adipocyte differentiation in myoblastic Myf5-positive precursor cells. Expression of UCP1 and PRDM16 were induced. The basal metabolic rate and respiratory capacity of  were increased upon A. bilimbi treatment.The findings suggest that Averrhoa bilimbi ethanolic leaf extract induces adipocyte browning through PRDM16 activation and enhances  activity due to UCP1 up-regulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663111>New Moonlighting Functions of Mitochondrial Cytochrome c in the Cytoplasm and Nucleus.</a></h1><p>Cytochrome c (Cc) is a protein that functions as an electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. However, Cc has moonlighting roles outside  driving the transition of apoptotic cells from life to death. When living cells are damaged, Cc escapes its natural mitochondrial environment and, once in the cytosol, it binds other proteins to form a complex named the apoptosome-a platform that triggers caspase activation and further leads to controlled cell dismantlement. Early released Cc also binds to inositol 1,4,-triphosphate receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, which stimulates further massive Cc release from . Besides the well-characterized binding proteins contributing to the pro-apoptotic functions of Cc, many novel protein targets have been recently described. Among them, histone chaperones were identified as key partners of Cc following DNA breaks, indicating that Cc might modulate chromatin dynamics through competitive binding to histone chaperones. In this article, we review the ample set of recently discovered anti-apoptotic proteins-involved in DNA damage, transcription and energetic metabolism-reported to interact with Cc in the cytoplasm and even the nucleus upon DNA breaks.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601784>Heat shock protein 60 regulates yolk sac erythropoiesis in mice.</a></h1><p>The yolk sac is the first site of blood-cell production during embryonic development in both murine and human. Heat shock proteins (HSPs), including HSP70 and HSP27, have been shown to play regulatory roles during erythropoiesis. However, it remains unknown whether HSP60, a molecular chaperone that resides mainly in , could also regulate early erythropoiesis. In this study, we used Tie2-Cre to deactivate the Hspd1 gene in both hematopoietic and vascular endothelial cells, and found that Tie2-CreHspd1 (HSP60) mice were embryonic lethal between the embryonic day 10. (E10.) and E11., exhibiting growth retardation, anemia, and vascular defects. Of these, anemia was observed first, independently of vascular and growth phenotypes. Reduced numbers of erythrocytes, as well as an increase in cell apoptosis, were found in the HSP60 yolk sac as early as E9.0, indicating that deletion of HSP60 led to abnormality in yolk sac erythropoiesis. Deletion of HSP60 was also able to reduce mitochondrial membrane potential and the expression of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in yolk sac erythrocytes. Furthermore, cyclosporine A (CsA), which is a well-recognized modulator in regulating the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) by interacting with Cyclophilin D (CypD), could significantly decrease cell apoptosis and partially restore VDAC expression in mutant yolk sac erythrocytes. Taken together, we demonstrated an essential role of HSP60 in regulating yolk sac cell survival partially via a mPTP-dependent mechanism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641820>Activation of death receptor, DR5 and -mediated apoptosis by a 3,4,-trimethoxybenzyloxy derivative in wild-type and p53 mutant colorectal cancer cell lines.</a></h1><p>The rationale of designing compounds containing a (3,4,-trimethoxybenzyloxy) phenyl moiety is largely due to its potential antioxidant and cytotoxic activities. A previous study focused on its antioxidant mechanism, whereas in this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of a series of 28 analogues and the mechanism of apoptosis of the most cytotoxic compound against wild-type (HCT-116) and p53 mutant (HT-29) colorectal cancer cell lines. The series of analogues comprise of different families, namely hydrazone, oxadiazole, thiosemicarbazides and triazoles. In the initial cytotoxicity screening, N-(3,4,-trimethoxybenzylidene)-4-(3,4,-trimethoxybenzyloxy) benzohydrazide, henceforth known as, P5H, was found to be most cytotoxic against human colorectal cancer cell lines (IC for HCT-116 = 11.79 μM and HT-29 = 18.52 μM). Additionally, P5H was found to have some degree of selectivity towards cancer cells compared to normal human colon cells (CCD-112 CoN). Subsequent investigation had brought insight on P5H ability to induce apoptosis in both HCT-116 and HT-29 cell lines. Cell cycle analysis showed both cell lines were arrested at the G2/M phase upon treatment. Our study concluded that P5H induced the death receptor, DR5 in HCT-116 and -mediated apoptosis pathway in HT-29. Therefore, P5H may be a promising candidate as a chemotherapy agent against colon cancer.

The presented NIR fluorescent cyanine- (Cy-) chromophore exhibits excellent photostability, narrow NIR absorption and emission bands, high molar extinction coefficient, high fluorescence quantum yield, and long fluorescence lifetime. The biological compatibility and negligible cytotoxicity further make the dye an attractive choice for biological applications. Confocal fluorescence microscopic studies in the fixed human lung carcinoma cell line (A549) stained with the targeting NIR Cy- dyes (Cy-5a and Cy-5b) at 700 nM concentration show their cellular uptake and localization, which is compared with the nontargeting Cy-5c. Mitochondrial target specificity is demonstrated by colocalization experiments using the mitochondrion-tracking probe, MitoTracker Red and lysosome-tracking probe, LysoTracker Green. Multicolor imaging of cellular organelles in A549 cells is achieved in combination with suitable target-specific dyes with distinct excitation and emission, such as green emitting FM 1-43FX to selectively image the plasma membrane, blue-fluorescent DAPI to stain the nucleus, and the synthesized NIR Cy- to image the .

Using C-labeled choline and C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and western blotting, we show increased  choline phospholipid (ChoPL) production and activation of PCYT1A (phosphate cytidylyltransferase 1, choline, alpha), the rate-limiting enzyme of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) synthesis, during autophagy. We also discovered that the loss of PCYT1A activity results in compromised autophagosome formation and maintenance in autophagic cells. Direct tracing of ChoPLs with fluorescence and immunogold labeling imaging revealed the incorporation of newly synthesized ChoPLs into autophagosomal membranes, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and  during anticancer drug-induced autophagy. Significant increase in the colocalization of fluorescence signals from the newly synthesized ChoPLs and mCherry-MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) was also found on autophagosomes accumulating in cells treated with autophagy-modulating compounds. Interestingly, cells undergoing active autophagy had an altered ChoPL profile, with longer and more unsaturated fatty acid/alcohol chains detected. Our data suggest that  synthesis may be required to increase autophagosomal ChoPL content and alter its composition, together with replacing phospholipids consumed from other organelles during autophagosome formation and turnover. This addiction to  ChoPL synthesis and the critical role of PCYT1A may lead to development of agents targeting autophagy-induced drug resistance. In addition, fluorescence imaging of choline phospholipids could provide a useful way to visualize autophagosomes in cells and tissues.

Many animal experiments confirmed that heat stress is a major cause of heat stroke death, which is due to severe damage to endothelial cells. In order to provide a theoretical basis for the treatment or mitigation of heat stress related diseases in broilers, the effect of taurine on injury and apoptosis of aortic endothelial cells in broilers under heat stress was investigated in the present study. Ten days healthy broilers were sacrificed, then aortic tissue was used to isolate and cultivate primary broiler aortic endothelial cells. The third to the fifth generations of cells were used in the experiment. The cells were randomly divided into five groups, including control group (C), heat stress group (HS), low taurine (HS+LTau) group, mild taurine (HS+MTau) group and high taurine (HS+HTau) group. Cells in all groups were cultivated for 24 h in cell incubator (37 °C, % CO). Then the heat stress group cells were cultivated in a 43 °C thermostatic water bath for 6 h under heat stress, and then re-incubated under 37 °C for 1 h. The results showed that compared with the control group, expression levels of Bax, Caspase-9, Caspase-3, Cyt-c, P53 and other pro-apoptosis factors in HS groups were significantly increased (P < 0.05), while expression levels of anti-apoptosis factor Bcl-2 showed a significant decrease (P < 0.05). Compared with HS group, expression levels of Bcl-2 in endothelial cells were significantly increased by taurine administration (P < 0.05), while expression of Bax, Caspase-9, Caspase-3, Cyt-c and P53 were significantly increased by taurine (P < 0.05). In summary, the present data indicated that taurine could protect against injury and apoptosis of aortic endothelial cells under heat stress by inhibiting the activation of -mediated apoptotic pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501660>Archangelolide: A sesquiterpene lactone with immunobiological potential from .</a></h1><p>Sesquiterpene lactones are secondary plant metabolites with sundry biological effects. In plants, they are synthesized, among others, for pesticidal and antimicrobial effects. Two such compounds, archangelolide and trilobolide of the guaianolide type, are structurally similar to the well-known and clinically tested lactone thapsigargin. While trilobolide has already been studied by us and others, there are only scarce reports on the biological activity of archangelolide. Here we present the preparation of its fluorescent derivative based on a dansyl moiety using azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition having obtained the two sesquiterpene lactones from the seeds of  Wulfen using supercritical CO extraction. We show that dansyl-archangelolide localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum of living cells similarly to trilobolide; localization in  was also detected. This led us to a more detailed study of the anticancer potential of archangelolide. Interestingly, we found that neither archangelolide nor its dansyl conjugate did exhibit cytotoxic effects in contrast to the structurally closely related counterparts trilobolide and thapsigargin. We explain this observation by a molecular dynamics simulation, in which, in contrast to trilobolide, archangelolide did not bind into the sarco/endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPase cavity utilized by thapsigargin. Last, but not least, archangelolide exhibited anti-inflammatory activity, which makes it promising compound for medicinal purposes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631068>Measuring mitochondrial respiration in adherent cells infected with Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas, 1909 using Seahorse extracellular flux analyser.</a></h1><p>Infection with Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas, 1909 is reported to increase the production of reactive oxygen species in patients with Chagas disease.  dysfunction, host inflammatory response and inadequate antioxidant response are described as the main factors leading to oxidative stress during acute and chronic stages of the disease.

In this protocol, we standardised the use of XFe24 technology in T. cruzi infected AC16 cardiomyocytes and SGHPL- trophoblasts. In addition, we provide a list of optimised assay specifications, advantages and critical steps to be considered during the process.

Since the tumor microenvironment is generally characterized by hypoxia, its understanding is important for cancer therapy. We hypothesized that hypoxia promotes the mitochondrial function, mobility, and proliferation of CRC by up-regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α).To assess the effects of PGC-1α under hypoxia, we investigated the mitochondrial function, cell motility, and sphere formation as well as proliferation and apoptosis of CRC.Under hypoxia, we confirmed the increased expression of PGC-1α and reduced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activating anti-oxidant enzymes. Also, up-regulation of PGC-1α enhanced the motility, sphere formation, and proliferation of CRC. Under the presence of the anti-cancer drug -fluorouracil (5FU), up-regulation of PGC-1α under hypoxia promoted resistance of CRC against 5FU-induced apoptosis.Targeting PGC-1α could to be a powerful strategy for CRC therapy.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

However, the use of such tools has caveats and they are unable to distinguish precise sites of production within the reactions of substrate oxidation and the electron transport chain. S1QELs are specific small-molecule Suppressors of site IQElectron Leak and S3QELs are specific small-molecule Suppressors of site IIIQoElectron Leak; they prevent superoxide/hydrogen production at specific sites without affecting electron transport or oxidative phosphorylation. We discuss the benefits of using S1QELs and S3QELs as opposed to -targeted antioxidants, mitochondrial poisons, and genetic manipulation.

Cisplatin-associated kidney injury is known to result from its accumulation in the renal tubule with excessive generation of reactive oxygen species. In this study, we encapsulated honokiol, a natural lipophilic polyphenol constituent extracted from  into nano-sized liposomes (nanosome honokiol) and examined the in vivo countering effects on cisplatin-induced renal injury. We observed that  mg/kg body weight. nanosome honokiol was the lowest effective dosage to efficiently restore renal functions of cisplatin-treated animals. The improvement is likely due the maintenance of cellular localization of cytochrome c and thus preserves  integrity and their redox activity, which as a consequence, reduced cellular oxidative stress and caspase 3-associated apoptosis. These improvements at the cellular level are later reflected on the observed reduction of kidney inflammation and fibrosis. In agreement with our earlier in vitro study showing protective effects of honokiol on kidney cell lines, we demonstrated further in the current study, that nanosuspension-formulated honokiol provides protective effects against cisplatin-induced chronic kidney damages in vivo. Our findings not only benefit cisplatin-receiving patients with reduced renal side effects, but also provide potential alternative and synergic solutions to improve clinical safety and efficacy of cisplatin treatment on cancer patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623083>Detection of Superoxide Alterations Induced by -Fluorouracil on HeLa Cells with a Cell-Based Biosensor.</a></h1><p>In vitro cell culture monitoring can be used as an indicator of cellular oxidative stress for the assessment of different chemotherapy agents.A cell-based bioelectric biosensor was used to detect alterations in superoxide levels in the culture medium of HeLa cervical cancer cells after treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent -fluorouracil (-FU). The cytotoxic effects of -fluorouracil on HeLa cells were assessed by the MTT proliferation assay, whereas oxidative damage and induction of apoptosis were measured fluorometrically by the -targeted MitoSOX™ Red and caspase-3 activation assays, respectively.The results of this study indicate that -FU differentially affects superoxide production and caspase-3 activation when applied in cytotoxic concentrations against HeLa cells, while superoxide accumulation is in accordance with mitochondrial superoxide levels. Our findings suggest that changes in superoxide concentration could be detected with the biosensor in a non-invasive and rapid manner, thus allowing a reliable estimation of oxidative damage due to cell apoptosis.These findings may be useful for facilitating future high throughput screening of different chemotherapeutic drugs with a cytotoxic principle based on free radical production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31499216>SkQThy, a novel and promising -targeted antioxidant.</a></h1><p>Since thymoquinone (2-isopropyl--methylbenzoquinone) isolation from Nigella sativa in 1963, various studies have reported on its diverse pharmacological properties. However, despite its versatile healing abilities, clinical trials involving the use of thymoquinone have not been initiated due to its poor bioavailability. Many attempts have been made to improve the therapeutic efficacy of thymoquinone by synthesizing analogs, as well as by developing nanotechnology-based delivery systems. We hypothesized that some of the issues with thymoquinone delivery and bioavailability could be resolved by targeted delivery to  of thymoquinone derivatives conjugated to the penetrating lipophilic cationic triphenylphosphonium fragment. As  are the major site of reactive oxygen species generation in the cell, such a membranotropic thymoquinone derivative can act as an efficient antioxidant or prooxidant depending on the concentration used.

About 35% of PCa recurs and is often transformed to castrate-resistant PCa (CRPCa), the most deadly and aggressive form of PCa. However, the standard-of-care treatment for CRPCa (e.g., enzalutamide with abiraterone) usually has limited efficacy. Herein, we report a novel molecule (i.e., PAWI-2) that inhibits cellular proliferation of androgen-sensitive (i.e., LNCaP) and androgen-insensitive (i.e., PC-3) cells. In vivo studies in a PC-3 xenograft model showed that PAWI-2 (20 mg/kg/day, 21 days, i.p.) inhibited tumor growth by 49% compared to vehicle-treated mice. PAWI-2 synergized currently clinically used enzalutamide in in vitro inhibition of PCa cell viability and re-sensitized inhibition of in vivo PC-3 tumor growth. Compared to vehicle-treated mice, PC-3 xenograft studies also showed that PAWI-2 (20 mg/kg/day, 21 days, i.p.) and enzalutamide ( mg/kg/day, 21 days, i.p.) inhibited tumor growth by 63%. Synergism was mainly controlled by the imbalance of pro-survival factors (i.e., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1) and anti-survival factors (i.e., Bax, Bak) induced by affecting mitochondrial membrane potential/ dynamics. Thus, PAWI-2 utilizes a distinct mechanism of action to inhibit PCa growth independently of androgen receptor signaling overcomes enzalutamide-resistant CRPCa. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: CRPCa is the most aggressive human PCa but standard chemotherapies for CRPCa are largely ineffective. PAWI-2 potently inhibits PCa proliferation in vitro and in vivo regardless of AR status and uses a distinct mechanism of action. PAWI-2 has greater utility in treating CRPCa than standard of care therapy. PAWI-2 possesses promising therapeutic potency in low-dose combination therapy with a clinically used drug (i.e., enzalutamide).

In vitro, hippocampal neuronal cell line (HT22) cells were incubated with or without mifepristone (RU486) for 1 h, then treated with 400 μM cortisol (CORT) for 3 h. In vivo, autophagy was measured by western blotting. In vitro, monodansylcadaverine staining, western blotting, flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence were used to characterize the mechanism of autophagy induced by excess CORT.

While these materials have widespread use in consumer products and industrial applications, the potential health risks associated with exposure to them remain to be fully characterized. Carbon nanotubes are among the most widely used nanomaterials and have high potential for human exposure by inhalation. These nanomaterials are known to penetrate the cell membrane and interact with intracellular molecules, resulting in a multitude of documented effects, including oxidative stress, genotoxicity, impaired metabolism, and apoptosis. While the capacity for carbon nanotubes to damage nuclear DNA has been established, the effect of exposure on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is relatively unexplored. In this study, we investigated the potential of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to impair mitochondrial gene expression and function in human bronchial epithelial cells (BECs). Primary BECs were exposed to sub-cytotoxic doses (up to 3 μg/ml) of MWCNTs for  d and assessed for changes in expression of all mitochondrial protein-coding genes, heteroplasmies, and insertion/deletion mutations (indels). Exposed cells were also measured for cytotoxicity, metabolic function, mitochondrial abundance, and mitophagy. We found that MWCNTs upregulated mitochondrial gene expression, while significantly decreasing oxygen consumption rate and mitochondrial abundance. Confocal microscopy revealed induction of mitophagy by 2 hours of exposure. Mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy and insertion/deletion mutations were not significantly affected by any treatment. We conclude that carbon nanotubes cause mitochondrial dysfunction that leads to mitophagy in exposed BECs via a mechanism unrelated to its reported genotoxicity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654209>Involvement of the biogenic active amine agmatine in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and release of pro-apoptotic factors.</a></h1><p>Agmatine (AGM) produces a dual effect on the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) mechanism in rat liver : at low concentrations, it induces the phenomenon, at high ones, inhibits it. The prevention at high concentrations is evidenced by the significant inhibition of mitochondrial swelling induced by Ca and phosphate; in this condition, AGM both prevents the release of Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF) and enhances the release of other pro-apoptotic factors, such as cytochrome c (cyt c) and Smac/DIABLO. As these factors are released without MPT induction, the involvement of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) could be hypothesized. Cyclosporin A (CsA), a powerful inhibitor of MPT, enhanced the AGM-mediated inhibition of swelling, and surprisingly, prevented the release of cyt c and Smac/DIABLO. In the presence of Ca, AGM also activated the Bcl-2 family protein Bax, a key factor in inducing MOMP, which is inactivated by CsA. Together with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), Bax forms channels in the outer membrane further supporting the involvement of MOMP in the release of pro-apoptotic factors. In view of the fact that VDAC was inactivated by ruthenium red, which in turn inhibited the release of cyt c, it can be hypothesized that, on the one hand, AGM inhibits MPT induction and, on the other, it selectively permeabilizes the outer membrane via MOMP induction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665639>Dysregulation of Mitochondrial Ca Uptake and Sarcolemma Repair Underlie Muscle Weakness and Wasting in Patients and Mice Lacking MICU1.</a></h1><p>Muscle function is regulated by Ca, which mediates excitation-contraction coupling, energy metabolism, adaptation to exercise, and sarcolemmal repair. Several of these actions rely on Ca delivery to the mitochondrial matrix via the mitochondrial Ca uniporter, the pore of which is formed by mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). MCU's gatekeeping and cooperative activation are controlled by MICU1. Loss-of-protein mutation in MICU1 causes a neuromuscular disease. To determine the mechanisms underlying the muscle impairments, we used MICU1 patient cells and skeletal muscle-specific MICU1 knockout mice. Both these models show a lower threshold for MCU-mediated Ca uptake. Lack of MICU1 is associated with impaired mitochondrial Ca uptake during excitation-contraction, aerobic metabolism impairment, muscle weakness, fatigue, and myofiber damage during physical activity. MICU1 deficit compromises mitochondrial Ca uptake during sarcolemmal injury, which causes ineffective repair of the damaged myofibers. Thus, dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca uptake hampers myofiber contractile function, likely through energy metabolism and membrane repair.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This review covers the synthesis and biological evaluation of pentacyclic triterpene (PT) conjugates with other molecules that have been found to increase the IC or improve the pharmacological profile of the parent PT. Some of these molecules are designed to target specific proteins or cellular organelles, which has resulted in highly selective lead structures for drug development. Other PT conjugates are useful for investigating their mechanism of action. This concept has been very successful: 1) Many compounds, especially -targeting PT conjugates, have reached a selective cytotoxicity at low nanomolar concentrations in cancer cells. 2) A number of PT conjugates have had high activity against HIV or the influenza virus. 3) Fluorescent PT conjugates have been able to visualize the PT in living cells, which has allowed quantification of the uptake and distribution of the PT within the cell. 4) Biotinylated PT conjugates have been used to identify target proteins, which may help to show their mechanism of action. ) A large number of PT conjugates with polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyamines, etc. form nanometer-sized micelles that have a much better pharmacological profile than the PT alone. In summary, the connection of a PT to an appropriate modifying molecule has resulted in extremely useful semisynthetic compounds with a high potential to treat cancer or viral infections or compounds that are useful for the study of the mechanism of action of PTs at the molecular level.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Ribosomal RNA sequences, DNA architecture and metabolism are strikingly similar in these two entities. Proteins and nucleic acids have been a hallmark for comparison between  and prokaryotes. In this chapter, similarities (and differences) between mitochondrial and prokaryotic membranes are addressed with a focus on structure-function relationship of different lipid classes. In order to be suitable for the theme of the book, a special emphasis is reserved to the effects of bioactive sphingolipids, mainly ceramide, on mitochondrial membranes and their roles in initiating programmed cell death.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624314>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery restores insulin-mediated glucose partitioning and mitochondrial dynamics in primary myotubes from severely obese humans.</a></h1><p>Impaired insulin-mediated glucose partitioning is an intrinsic metabolic defect in skeletal muscle from severely obese humans (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery has been shown to improve glucose metabolism in severely obese humans. The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of RYGB surgery on glucose partitioning, mitochondrial network morphology, and the markers of mitochondrial dynamics skeletal muscle from severely obese humans.Human skeletal muscle cells were isolated from muscle biopsies obtained from RYGB patients (BMI = 48.0 ± 2.1, n = 7) prior to, 1 month and 7 months following surgery and lean control subjects (BMI = 22.4 ± 1.1, n = 7). Complete glucose oxidation, non-oxidized glycolysis rates, mitochondrial respiratory capacity, mitochondrial network morphology, and the regulatory proteins of mitochondrial dynamics were determined in differentiated human myotubes.Myotubes derived from severely obese humans exhibited enhanced glucose oxidation (13.%; 95% CI [7.6, 19.4], P = 0.043) and reduced non-oxidized glycolysis (-1.3%; 95% CI [-11.1, 8.6]) in response to insulin stimulation at 7 months after RYGB when compared with the presurgery state (-0.6%; 95% CI [-.2, 4.0] and 19.%; 95% CI [4.0, 35.0], P = 0.006), and were not different from the lean controls (16.7%; 95% CI [11.8, 21.] and 1.9%; 95% CI [-1.6, .4], respectively). Further, the number of fragmented  and Drp1(Ser) phosphorylation were trended to reduce/reduced (0.0104, 95% CI [0.0085, 0.0126], P = 0.091 and 0.0085, 95% CI [0.0068, 0.0102], P = 0.05) in myotubes derived from severely obese humans at 7 months after RYGB surgery in comparison with the presurgery state. Finally, Drp1(Ser) phosphorylation was negatively correlated with insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation (r = -0.49, P = 0.037).These data indicate that an intrinsic metabolic defect of glucose partitioning in skeletal muscle from severely obese humans is restored by RYGB surgery. The restoration of glucose partitioning may be regulated through reduced mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 phosphorylation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570514>Detecting sequence signals in targeting peptides using deep learning.</a></h1><p>In bioinformatics, machine learning methods have been used to predict features embedded in the sequences. In contrast to what is generally assumed, machine learning approaches can also provide new insights into the underlying biology. Here, we demonstrate this by presenting TargetP 2.0, a novel state-of-the-art method to identify N-terminal sorting signals, which direct proteins to the secretory pathway, , and chloroplasts or other plastids. By examining the strongest signals from the attention layer in the network, we find that the second residue in the protein, that is, the one following the initial methionine, has a strong influence on the classification. We observe that two-thirds of chloroplast and thylakoid transit peptides have an alanine in position 2, compared with 20% in other plant proteins. We also note that in fungi and single-celled eukaryotes, less than 30% of the targeting peptides have an amino acid that allows the removal of the N-terminal methionine compared with 60% for the proteins without targeting peptide. The importance of this feature for predictions has not been highlighted before.© 2019 Armenteros et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546924>FOXO3a from the Nucleus to the : A Round Trip in Cellular Stress Response.</a></h1><p>Cellular stress response is a universal mechanism that ensures the survival or negative selection of cells in challenging conditions. The transcription factor Forkhead box protein O3 (FOXO3a) is a core regulator of cellular homeostasis, stress response, and longevity since it can modulate a variety of stress responses upon nutrient shortage, oxidative stress, hypoxia, heat shock, and DNA damage. FOXO3a activity is regulated by post-translational modifications that drive its shuttling between different cellular compartments, thereby determining its inactivation (cytoplasm) or activation (nucleus and ). Depending on the stress stimulus and subcellular context, activated FOXO3a can induce specific sets of nuclear genes, including cell cycle inhibitors, pro-apoptotic genes, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers, autophagy effectors, gluconeogenic enzymes, and others. On the other hand, upon glucose restriction, '-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) -dependent FOXO3a mitochondrial translocation allows the transcription of oxidative phosphorylation () genes, restoring cellular ATP levels, while in cancer cells, mitochondrial FOXO3a mediates survival upon genotoxic stress induced by chemotherapy. Interestingly, these target genes and their related pathways are diverse and sometimes antagonistic, suggesting that FOXO3a is an adaptable player in the dynamic homeostasis of normal and stressed cells. In this review, we describe the multiple roles of FOXO3a in cellular stress response, with a focus on both its nuclear and mitochondrial functions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586484>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and hypoxia exposures result in mitochondrial dysfunction in zebrafish.</a></h1><p>Organisms are routinely subjected to a variety of environmental and chemical perturbations simultaneously. Often, multi-stressor exposures result in unpredictable toxicity that occurs through unidentified mechanisms. Here, we focus on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and hypoxia, two environmental and physiological stressors that are known to co-occur in the environment. The aim of this study was to assess whether interactive mitochondrial dysfunction resulted from co-exposures of PAHs and hypoxia. Zebrafish embryos were co-exposed to non-teratogenic concentrations of an environmental PAH mixture and hypoxia beginning at 6 hpf for an acute period of 24 h and afterwards were given either no recovery period, 45 min,  -hs, or 18 -hs of recovery time in clean conditions. Mitochondrial function and integrity were assessed through the use of both in ovo and in vitro assays. Hypoxia exposures resulted in drastic reductions in parameters relating to mitochondrial respiration, ATP turnover, and mitochondrial DNA integrity. PAH exposures affected ATP production and content, as well as mitochondrial membrane dynamics and lactate content. While PAH and hypoxia exposures caused a broad range of effects, there appeared to be very little interaction between the two stressors in the co-exposure group. However, because hypoxia significantly altered mitochondrial function, the possibility remains that these effects may limit an individual's ability to respond to PAH toxicity and therefore could cause downstream interactive effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (CCA-adding enzyme) is known to add CCA trinucleotides to 3'-ends of tRNAs, whether other RNA species can be endogenous substrates of CCA-adding enzyme has not been widely explored yet. Herein, we used YAMAT-seq to identify non-tRNA substrates of CCA-adding enzyme. YAMAT-seq captures RNA species that form secondary structures with 4-nt protruding 3'-ends of the sequence '-NCCA-3', which is the hallmark structure of RNAs that are generated by CCA-adding enzyme. By executing YAMAT-seq for human breast cancer cells and mining the sequence data, we identified novel candidate substrates of CCA-adding enzyme. These included fourteen 'CCA-RNAs' that only contain CCA as non-genomic sequences, and eleven 'NCCA-RNAs' that contain CCA and other nucleotides as non-genomic sequences. All newly-identified (N)CCA-RNAs were derived from the mitochondrial genome and were localized in . Knockdown of CCA-adding enzyme severely reduced the expression levels of (N)CCA-RNAs, suggesting that the CCA-adding enzyme-catalyzed CCA additions stabilize the expression of (N)CCA-RNAs. Furthermore, expression levels of (N)CCA-RNAs were severely reduced by various cellular treatments, including UV irradiation, amino acid starvation, inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, and inhibition of the cell cycle. These results revealed a novel CCA-mediated regulatory pathway for the expression of mitochondrial non-coding RNAs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635379>Cyst Reduction in a Polycystic Kidney Disease  Model Using Smac Mimics.</a></h1><p>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited malady affecting 12. million people worldwide. Therapeutic options to treat PKD are limited, due in part to lack of precise knowledge of underlying pathological mechanisms. Mimics of the second -derived activator of caspases (Smac) have exhibited activity as antineoplastic agents and reported recently to ameliorate cysts in a murine ADPKD model, possibly by differentially targeting cystic cells and sparing the surrounding tissue. A first-in-kind  PKD model has now been employed to probe further the activity of novel Smac mimics. Substantial reduction of cystic defects was observed in the Malpighian (renal) tubules of treated flies, underscoring mechanistic conservation of the cystic pathways and potential for efficient testing of drug prototypes in this PKD model. Moreover, the observed differential rescue of the anterior and posterior tubules overall, and within their physiologically diverse intermediate and terminal regions implied a nuanced response in distinct tubular regions contingent upon the structure of the Smac mimic. Knowledge gained from studying Smac mimics reveals the capacity for the  model to precisely probe PKD pharmacology highlighting the value for such critical evaluation of factors implicated in renal function and pathology.</p></html>
