Based on laboratory and clinical studies, it appears that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that are generated extracellularly and intracellularly by various mechanisms are among the major intermediary risk factors that initiate and promote neurodegeneration in idiopathic AD. Therefore, multiple antioxidant supplements could be useful in the prevention of AD, and as an adjunct to standard therapy in the treatment of AD. The products of inflammatory reactions such as prostaglandins (PGs; PGE1 and ), free radicals, cytokines, and complement proteins are neurotoxic. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which inhibit the synthesis of PGs, reduce the rate of deterioration of cognitive functions in patients with advanced AD. Cholinergic drugs are routinely used in the treatment of AD to improve cognitive functions. Therefore, we propose that a combination of multiple antioxidants and NSAIDs may be more beneficial in the prevention of AD, and that this combination taken together with cholinergic drugs may be more effective in the treatment of AD than the individual agents alone. We also hypothesize that, in idiopathic AD, epigenetic components of neurons such as , membranes, other membranous structures, and protein modifications--rather than the genes of neurons--are the primary targets for the action of neurotoxins including free radicals. In some familial AD, mutations in amyloid precursor protein and presenilins are associated with the risk of early onset of this disease; however, their mechanisms of action are not fully understood.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/647120>Hormone-stimulated heme synthesis by isolated .</a></h2><p>Erythropoietin (Ep), insulin, and prostaglandins E1 and A1 (PGE1, ) enhanced heme synthesis by  isolated from embryonic and adult mouse liver cells. The combination of Ep with PGE1 had an antagonistic effect, while that of Ep with  gave an additive result. The capability of isolated human platelet  to synthesize heme was also shown.

Optimal stimulation was observed at low PG concentrations (10-7 to 10-9 M), with malate or malate-NADPH supported side-chain cleavage. Under the same conditions, two endoperoxide analogs and several fatty acids were ineffective. The PG action was not observed with a mitochondrial acetone powder preparation. These observations suggest that primary PG may act by interfering with calcium distribution at the mitochondrial level, leading to the activation of cholesterol side-chain cleavage. Thus, an intracellular action of endogenous PG may be considered in the regulation of adrenal cortex steroidogenic functions.</p></html>
