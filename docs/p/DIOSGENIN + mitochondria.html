To understand their detailed antitumor mechanisms, a fluorophore-appended derivative of  [Glc/CNHphth- (GND)] was synthesized, starting from  and glucosamine hydrochloride in overall yields of 7-12% over 7-10 steps. Co-localization of GND with organelle-specific stains, transmission electron microscopy, and relative protein analyses demonstrated that GND crossed the plasma membrane through organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 and distributed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), lysosome, and . In this process, GND induced ER swelling, mitochondrial damage, and autophagosome and upregulating IRE-1α to induce autophagy and apoptosis. Furthermore, autophagy inhibitor chloroquine delayed the appearance of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and inhibited cleaved caspase 8, which indicated that GND induced autophagy to activate caspase-8-dependent apoptosis. These observations suggested that diosgenyl saponin was a potent anticancer agent that elicited ER stress and -mediated apoptotic pathways in liver cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29990575>Molecular mechanism and inhibitory targets of dioscin in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Dioscin has been known for its anti-cancer activity; however, its detailed molecular mechanisms have not been studied so far. Herein, we evaluated the anti-cancer activity of dioscin for proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in HepG2 cancer cells. Initially, dioscin was purified and identified from Polygonatum sibiricum by HPLC, MS, and NMR analysis, respectively. Dioscin inhibited the cell multiplication at IC of 8.34 μM, altered the cell morphology, arrested the cell cycle in G2/M phase and led to considerable programmed cell death. Furthermore, it has efficiently promoted the mitochondrial pathway and death receptor pathway. The inhibition of Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 proteins in these pathways abolished the dioscin induced apoptosis significantly; while dioscin inhibited the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Moreover, dioscin exposure led to enhanced intracellular ROS generation and the mRNA expression of JNK gene which emphasized their involvement in the apoptosis process in HepG2 cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The chondrocytes were randomly assigned into 4 groups: an OA group, a Dgn+OA group, a Dgn+Sirtinol+OA group, and a Sirtinol+OA group. Expressions of SIRT1, acetylation-regulated transcription factor 1 (Ac-FOXO1), and Bax were detected in the 4 groups by Western blot. Changes in levels of succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome C oxidase, and superoxide dismutase of mitochondrion in the 4 groups were observed.  Results: Compared with the OA group, SIRT1 protein expression was increased in the OA+Dgn group (P<0.05), while the Ac-FOXO1 and Bax protein expressions were decreased (P<0.05), the SDH and COX expressions were decreased, and the SOD content was decreased (P<0.05). Compared with the OA+Dgn group, the SIRT1 expression in the OA+Dgn+Sirtinol group and the Sirtinol+OA group was increased (P<0.05), while the Ac-FOXO1 and Bax protein expressions were decreased (P<0.05). The SDH and COX expressions were decreased, the SOD content was decreased, the SDH and COX expressions were increased, and the SOD content was increased in the OA group (All P<0.05), while those indexes were reversed in the OA+Dgn+Sirtinol group and the Sirtinol+OA group (All P<0.05).  Conclusion: The SIRT1 signaling pathway and OA are closely related to changes in chondrocyte apoptosis, in which Dgn may play a protective role in anti-OA by activating SIRT1 signaling pathway to inhibit apoptosis of chondrocytes and to increase chondrocyte mitochondrial oxidative stress capacity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28449039>Polyphyllin I induces G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in U251 human glioma cells via mitochondrial dysfunction and the JNK signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Glioblastoma is the most aggressive brain tumor, and its prognosis remains poor. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are needed for glioma therapy. Polyphyllin I (PPI), a bioactive constituent extracted from Paris polyphylla, was reported to have anti-tumor activity. However, the detailed mechanism for this activity remains unclear. Here, we investigated the inhibitory effects of PPI on glioma cells and its mechanisms in vitro. U251 cells were treated with various concentrations of PPI (2-9 μM) for 24 to 72 h. The inhibition of U251 cell proliferation by PPI was assessed by MTT assay. The effects on cell cycle and apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry with PI and annexin V-FITC/PI dual staining, and the cell mitochondrial membrane potential level was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy with JC-1 staining. The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins and JNK signal pathway proteins were evaluated by western blot analysis. Results showed that PPI significantly inhibited the proliferation of U251 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. PPI induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis, and it upregulated the expressions of Bax, cytochrome c, and p-JNK, but downregulated the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in U251 cells. Moreover, PPI provoked the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition, apoptosis induced by the PPI was remarkably suppressed by the JNK inhibitor SP600125. Our data provide evidence that PPI inhibits proliferation and induces apoptotic cell death in U251 cells. This effect may be associated with the JNK pathway. These results suggest that PPI is an activator of the JNK signaling pathway with a potential anti-glioma effect.© The Author 2017.

However, the clinical application has been limited for its hepatotoxicity. In this study, we explored the cascade working mechanisms of time-dependent hepatotoxicity induced by total saponins extracted from Rhizoma Dioscorea bulbifera (TSRD). Animals were orally administered with TSRD for indicated time period. The adverse effects were determined by histopathology and biochemistry. Similar hepatic index was analyzed in L-O2 cells exposed to dioscin for different durations. We found that TSRD could initially cause cell damage and cholestasis in rats. With the treatment going on, oxidative stress injury and up-regulation of Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) were observed both in vitro and in vivo. Eventually, TSRD induced mitochondrial permeability results in apoptosis or necrosis. Taken together, we provided evidence for the time-dependent hepatotoxicity of TSRD and created a 3-step injury model to clarify its cascade working mechanisms.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The effects of dioscin against human gastric carcinoma in vivo were accomplished by the xenografts of MGC-803 cells in BALB/c nude mice.AO/EB and DAPI staining, TEM, single cell gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry assays were used in cell experiments. Then, an iTRAQ-based proteomics approach, DNA and siRNA transfection experiments were carried out for mechanism investigation.In MGC-803 cells, dioscin caused DNA damage and mitochondrial change, induced ROS generation, Ca(2+) release and cell apoptosis, and blocked cell cycle at S phase. In vivo results showed that dioscin significantly suppressed the tumor growth of MGC-803 cell xenografts in nude mice. In addition, dioscin markedly inhibited cell migration, caused Cytochrome c release and adjusted mitochondrial signal pathway. Then, an iTRAQ-based proteomics approach was carried out and 121 differentially expressed proteins were found, in which five biomarkers associated with cell cycle, apoptosis and migration were evaluated. Dioscin significantly up-regulated the levels of GALR-2 and RBM-3, and down-regulated CAP-1, Tribbles-2 and CliC-3. Furthermore, overexpressed DNA transfection of CAP-1 enhanced cell migration and invasion, which was decreased by dioscin. SiRNA to Tribbles-2 affected the protein levels of Bcl-2, Bax and MAPKs, suggesting that dioscin decreased Tribbles-2 level leading to cell apoptosis.Our works confirmed the activity of dioscin against gastric cancer. In addition, this work also provided that dioscin is a new potent candidate for treating gastric cancer in the future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Cells were pretreated with various concentrations of T. terrestris L. fruit methanol extract (10 and 25μg/ml) and Cyclosporin A (1μM) for 24h prior to the induction of ischemia.Different parameters like lactate dehydrogenase release, total antioxidant capacity, glutathione content and antioxidant enzymes were investigated. Studies were conducted on mitochondria by analyzing alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential, integrity, and dynamics (fission and fusion proteins - Mfn1, Mfn2, OPA1, Drp1 and Fis1). Various biochemical processes in mitochondria like activity of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes, oxygen consumption and ATP production was measured. Ischemia for 1h caused a significant (p≤0.05) increase in LDH leakage, decrease in antioxidant activity and caused mitochondrial dysfunction. T. terrestris L. fruit methanol extract pretreatment was found effective in safeguarding mitochondria via its antioxidant potential, mediated through various bioactives. HPLC of T. terrestris L. fruit methanol extract revealed the presence of ferulic acid, phloridzin and .T. terrestris L. fruit ameliorate ischemic insult in H9c2 cells by safeguarding mitochondrial function.

The effect of  on oxidative stress induced by I/R injury was evaluated in this study. Rat hearts were subjected to 30 minutes of global ischemia followed by 90 minutes of reperfusion. 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) was used before administration of  and before ischemia. The activities of myocardial creatine kinase (CK), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were measured. Administration of  before ischemia significantly lowered CK and MDA levels as compared with control group (p < 0.05) and increased GPX (p < 0.05) and SOD (p < 0.01) activities in comparison with control group. Pre-administration of 5-HD significantly attenuated the protective effects of .

In this study, the effects of dioscin against human cervical carcinoma HeLa and SiHa cells were further confirmed, and the possible mechanism(s) were investigated. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) assay and DAPI staining were used to detect the cellular morphology. Flow cytometry was used to assay cell apoptosis, ROS and Ca(2+) levels. Single cell gel electrophoresis and immunofluorescence assays were used to test DNA damage and cytochrome C release. The results showed that dioscin significantly inhibited cell proliferation and caused DNA damage in HeLa and SiHa cells. The mechanistic investigation showed that dioscin caused the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol. In addition, dioscin significantly up-regulated the protein levels of Bak, Bax, Bid, p53, caspase-3, caspase-9, and down-regulated the protein levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. Our work thus demonstrated that dioscin notably induces apoptosis in HeLa and SiHa cells through adjusting ROS-mediated DNA damage and the mitochondrial signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29389802>Dioscin inhibits colon cancer cells' growth by reactive oxygen species-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and p38 and JNK pathways.</a></h2><p>Dioscin is a natural steroid saponin derived from several plants that shows potent anticancer effects against a variety of cancer cells. Here, we investigated the antitumor effect of dioscin against human colon cancer cells and evaluated the molecular mechanism involved in this process. The cell cytotoxicity was studied by the MTT assay and BrdU incorporation. The proapoptotic mechanism of dioscin was characterized by flow cytometry analysis. A western blot and an immunofluorescence staining were used to investigate how dioscin induces apoptosis in vitro. In our study, dioscin could significantly inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner. Dioscin induces apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, promoting the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, Bax translocation to the , cytochrome C release to cytosol, activations of caspase-9/3, PARP cleavage, and subsequent apoptosis. Dioscin-induced apoptosis was accompanied by sustained phosphorylation of JNK, p38-MAPK. N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a scavenger of ROS, significantly reversed dioscin-induced cell death and activation of JNK and p38. Collectively, the data indicate that the induction of apoptosis by dioscin is mediated through ROS proteins, which are critical upstream signals for JNK/p38-MAPK activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27623551>A synergistic antitumor effect of polyphyllin I and formosanin C on hepatocarcinoma cells.</a></h2><p>Polyphyllin I (PPI) and formosanin C (FC) were regarded as effective and imperative components isolated from Rhizoma Paridis saponins (RPS) and exhibited strong anti-tumor effects on a variety of cancers. With the wide application of complex mixtures in clinics, synergistic interactions are of vital importance in phytomedicine. Therefore, it is of inherent importance to study whether there is a synergistic anti-tumor effect on PPI and FC from one herb. In this study, the viability was detected by MTT assay. The combination index (CI) analysis was used to assess their synergistic effect. Consequently, there was a synergistic anti-tumor effect between PPI and FC at a ratio of 1:1. The CI value was less than 1.0. Their combination significantly increased their single G1 phase arrest and mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway. Meanwhile, PPI and FC reduced the ability of cell migration. In conclusion, polyphyllin I and formosanin C showed a synergistic anti-tumor effect on hepatocarcinoma cells.

However, its effect on laryngeal cancer remains unknown. In the present paper, our results showed that dioscin markedly caused cell apoptosis and DNA damage, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, induced S-phase arrest, and inhibited invasion of human laryngeal cancer HEp-2 and TU212 cells. Mechanism investigation showed that dioscin markedly up-regulated p53 level, and down-regulated cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and Cyclin A levels. In addition, dioscin significantly down-regulated the levels of p-ERK, Bcl-2, up-regulated the levels of p-JNK, p-p38, Bax, cleaved caspase-3/-9, and caused Cytochrome c release. Furthermore, U0126, an ERK1/2 inhibitor, markedly down-regulated Bcl-2 level, up-regulated the levels of Bax, cleaved caspase-3/9, and enhanced Cytochrome c release inducted by dioscin. While, SP600125 (one JNK inhibitor) and SB203580 (one p38 inhibitor) markedly up-regulated Bcl-2 level, down-regulated the levels of Bax, cleaved caspase-3/9, and obviously boosted Cytochrome c release induced by dioscin. Interestingly, dioscin also markedly down-regulated the levels of MMP2 and MMP9 associated with tumor invasion. Taken together, our study indicated that dioscin suppressed laryngeal cancer cells growth via inducting cell-cycle arrest, MAPK-mediated mitochondrial- derived apoptosis and inhibiting tumor invasion, which could be used as one potential candidate for the treatment of laryngeal cancer in the future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Next, we showed compound 1 concentration-dependently inhibited necrotic cell death pathway activation and 2.5 mM compound 1 also prevented the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, adenosine triphosphate production, and reactive oxygen species generation in mouse pancreatic acinar cells. Finally, we showed compound 1 protected against three clinically representative murine models of AP and significantly improved pancreatitis-associated acute lung injury.

After 4 weeks of treatment, the histopathological changes of cartilage tissue were observed by toluidine blue staining under light microscopy and the ultrastructure of chondrocytes was observed under electron microscopy. The primarily cultured chondrocytes of OA mice were randomly divided into 4 groups:(1) OA group, (2) Dgn group, (3) Dgn+AG490 group, (4) AG490 group. The expression of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, Bax, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) were detected by Western blotting, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) was detected using colorimetric method.  The morphological observation showed that the chondrocytes of OA group presented considerable pathological changes, while the chondrocytes in OA+Dgn group maintained intact membrane. Electron microscopy observation found obvious injury in cartilage tissues of OA group, while that in OA+Dgn group remained smooth. Compared with OA group, the expressions of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 in chondrocytes of Dgn group were increased (all <0.05), and the expressions of Bax protein, SDH, COX and SOD were decreased (all <0.05). While compared with Dgn group, the expressions of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, SDH, COX and SOD in chondrocytes of Dgn+AG490 group were decreased (all <0.05), and the expression of Bax protein was increased (<0.05).   can inhibit apoptosis and increase mitochondrial oxidative stress capacity of chondrocytes in mice with osteoarthritis, which is closely related to the activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26313911>α-Solanine induces ROS-mediated autophagy through activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and inhibition of Akt/mTOR pathway.</a></h2><p>α-Solanine is a glycoalkaloid found in species of the nightshade family including potato. It was primarily reported to have toxic effects in humans. However, there is a growing body of literature demonstrating in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity of α-solanine. Most of these studies have shown activation of apoptosis as the underlying mechanism in antitumor activity of α-solanine. In this study, we report α-solanine as a potential inducer of autophagy, which may act synergistically or in parallel with apoptosis to exert its cytotoxic effect. Induction of autophagy was demonstrated by several assays including electron microscopy, immunoblotting of autophagy markers and immunofluorescence for LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 (MAP1) light chain-3) puncta. α-Solanine-induced autophagic flux was demonstrated by additionally enhanced--turnover of LC3-II and--accumulation of LC3-specific puncta after co-incubation of cells with either of the autophagolysosome inhibitors--chloroquine and--bafilomycin A1. We also demonstrated α-solanine-induced oxidative damage in regulating autophagy where pre-incubation of cells with reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger resulted in suppression of CM-H2DCFDA (5 (and 6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester) fluorescence as well as decrease in LC3-II turnover. α-Solanine treatment caused an increase in the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins (BiP, activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), X-box-binding protein 1, PERK, inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endonuclease 1, ATF4 and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-homologous protein) suggesting activation of unfolded protein response pathway. Moreover, we found downregulation of phosphorylated Akt (Thr308 and Ser473), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; Ser2448 and Ser2481) and 4E-BP1 (Thr37/46) by α-solanine implying suppression of the Akt/mTOR pathway.

Global ischaemia was induced by 30-min occlusion of aortic flow followed by 90-min reperfusion. Cardiac haemodynamics were recorded throughout the experiment using a PowerLab data acquisition system.The levels of creatine kinase (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the coronary effluents were estimated colourimetrically.  pre-administration significantly decreased the release of LDH and CK-MD into the coronary effluent as compared the with the control group (P < 0.05). The left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and contractility (± dP/dt) were significantly improved and restored to pre-ischaemic values in the -receiving group (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, coronary flow and heart rate between the control and -treated groups during the pre-ischaemic and reperfusion periods. Blocking the mitoKATP channels by 5-HD completely eliminated the positive effect of the  on the LVDP and ± dP/dt (P < 0.05). However, blocking the NO system by L-NAME slightly reduced the  effects and the inhibitory effect of L-NAME was less than 5-HD.The results showed that  may have cardioprotective effects against myocardial reperfusion injury through activating the mitoKATP channels.© The Author(s) 2014.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29457828>Dihydrodiosgenin protects against experimental acute pancreatitis and associated lung injury through mitochondrial protection and PI3Kγ/Akt inhibition.</a></h2><p>Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a painful and distressing disorder of the exocrine pancreas with no specific treatment.

In the present study, we found that polyphyllin I induces mitochondrial translocation of DRP1 by dephosphorylating DRP1 at Ser637, leading to mitochondrial fission, cytochrome c release from  into the cytosol and, ultimately apoptosis. Polyphyllin I also increased the stabilization of full-length PINK1 at the mitochondrial surface, leading to the recruitment of PARK2, P62, ubiquitin, and LC3B-II to  and culminating in mitophagy. PINK1 knockdown markedly suppressed polyphyllin I-induced mitophagy and enhanced polyphyllin I-induced, DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fission and apoptosis. Furthermore, suppression of DRP1 by mdivi-1 or shRNA inhibited PINK1 knockdown/polyphyllin I-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis, suggesting that PINK1 depletion leads to excessive fission and, subsequently, mitochondrial fragmentation. An in vivo study confirmed that polyphyllin I greatly inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 xenografts, and these effects were enhanced by PINK1 knockdown. These data describe the mechanism by which PINK1 contributes to polyphyllin I-induced mitophagy and apoptosis and suggest that polyphyllin I may be an effective drug for breast cancer treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27721159>Chemosensitizing effect of Paris Saponin I on Camptothecin and 10-hydroxycamptothecin in lung cancer cells via p38 MAPK, ERK, and Akt signaling .</a></h2><p>Paris Saponin I (PSI), a steroidal sponins isolated from plant, has been exhibited antitumor and many other biological activities. In this study, we investigated the role and underlying mechanisms of PSI in the synergistic regulation of antitumor activity of Camptothecin (CPT) and 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) in four types of lung cancer cells. The inhibitory evaluation showed that PSI could significantly reduce the CPT/HCPT-mediated cell proliferation and enhance the sensitivities of H1299, H460 and H446 lung cancer cells to CPT/HCPT. Mechanism study indicated that PSI improved the CPT/HCPT induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells through mitochondria pathway including cytochrome C release and activation of caspase-9 and -3 cascades. Furthermore, PSI plus CPT/HCPT also increased the up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in H460 and H446 cells. Moreover, PSI enhanced CPT/HCPT-mediated inhibition of p38 MAPK and activation of phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in H1299 cells, and suppression of Akt and ERK  activation in H460 cells as well as in H446 cells. Collectively, our results demonstrated that PSI functions as a chemosensitizer by enhancing apoptosis through influencing p38 MAPK, ERK, and Akt  in lung cancer cells, and the combination with CPT/HCPT might be a promising strategy for the development of new therapeutic agents.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.
