The ability of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to prevent the development of  has gained considerable interest in recent years; however, the mechanisms-of-action remain poorly described. Therefore, we determined the efficacy of diets supplemented with either linoleic  (LA) or α- (ALA) in preventing  and reactive lipid accumulation in key metabolic tissues of the obese Zucker rat. Obese Zucker rats displayed impaired glucose homeostasis and reduced n-3 and n-6 PUFA content in the liver and epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT). After the 12-wk feeding intervention, both LA- and ALA-supplemented diets prevented whole body glucose and  intolerance; however, ALA had a more pronounced effect. These changes occurred in association with n-3 and n-6 accumulation in all tissues studied, albeit to different extents (EWAT > liver > muscle). Triacylglycerol (TAG), diacylglycerol (DAG), ceramide, and sphingolipid accumulation were not attenuated in obese animals supplemented with either LA or ALA, suggesting that preservation of glucose homeostasis occurred independent of changes in reactive lipid content. However, PUFA-supplemented diets differentially altered the fatty  composition of TAGs, DAGs, and PLs in a tissue-specific manner, suggesting essential fatty  metabolism differs between tissues. Together, our results indicate that remodeling of the fatty  composition of various lipid fractions may contribute to the improved glucose tolerance observed in obese rats fed PUFA-supplemented diets.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25097001>Adipose tissue n-3 fatty acids and metabolic syndrome.</a></h1><p>Evidence regarding the relationship of n-3 fatty acids (FA) to type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome components (MetS) is inconsistent.To examine associations of adipose tissue n-3 FA with MetS.We studied 1611 participants without prior history of diabetes or heart disease who were participants in a population-based case-control study of diet and heart disease (The Costa Rica Heart Study). We calculated prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for MetS by quartile of n-3 FA in adipose tissue derived mainly from plants (α- (ALA)), fish (eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA)) or metabolism (docosapentaenoic  (DPA), as well as the EPA:ALA ratio, a surrogate marker of delta-6 desaturase activity).N-3 FA levels in adipose tissue were associated with MetS prevalence in opposite directions. The PR (95% CI) for the highest compared with the lowest quartile adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), residence, lifestyle, diet and other FAs were 0.60 (0.44, 0.81) for ALA, 1.43 (1.12, 1.82) for EPA, 1.63 (1.22, 2.18) for DPA and 1.47 (1.14, 1.88) for EPA:ALA, all P for trend <0.05. Although these associations were no longer significant (except DPA) after adjustment for BMI, ALA and DPA were associated with lower glucose and higher triglyceride levels, P<0.05 (respectively).These results suggest that ALA could exert a modest protective benefit, whereas EPA and DHA are not implicated in MetS. The positive associations for DPA and MetS could reflect higher delta-6 desaturase activity caused by increased adiposity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27566476>Dietary Salba (Salvia hispanica L.) ameliorates the adipose tissue dysfunction of dyslipemic -resistant rats through mechanisms involving oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ.</a></h1><p>Rats fed a long-term sucrose-rich diet (SRD) developed adipose tissue dysfunction. In the adipose tissue of these SRD-fed rats, the present study analyzed the possible beneficial effects of dietary Salba (chia) seeds in improving or reversing the depletion of antioxidant defenses, changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS production.Wistar rats were fed a SRD for 3 months. After that, half of the animals continued with the SRD until month 6, while in the other half, corn oil was replaced by chia seeds for 3 months (SRD + chia). A reference group consumed a control diet all the time.Compared with the SRD-fed rats, the animals fed a SRD + chia showed a reduction in epididymal fat pad weight; the activities of antioxidant enzymes CAT, SOD and GPx returned to control values, while GR significantly improved; mRNA GPx increased, and both mRNA SOD and the redox state of glutathione returned to control values; a significant increase in the expression of Nrf2 was recorded. These results were accompanied by a decrease in XO activity and ROS contents as well as plasma IL-6 and TNF-α levels. Chia seeds reversed the decrease in PPARγ protein mass level and increased the n-3/n-6 fatty acids ratio of membrane phospholipids. Besides, dyslipidemia and  sensitivity were normalized.This study provides new information concerning some mechanisms related to the beneficial effects of dietary chia seeds in reversing adipose tissue oxidative stress and improving the adipose tissue dysfunction induced by a SRD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27307576>EPA prevents fat mass expansion and metabolic disturbances in mice fed with a Western diet.</a></h1><p>The impact of  (ALA), EPA, and DHA on obesity and metabolic complications was studied in mice fed a high-fat, high-sucrose (HF) diet. HF diets were supplemented with ALA, EPA, or DHA (1% w/w) and given to C57BL/6J mice for 16 weeks and to Ob/Ob mice for 6 weeks. In C57BL/6J mice, EPA reduced plasma cholesterol (-20%), limited fat mass accumulation (-23%) and adipose cell hypertrophy (-50%), and reduced plasma leptin concentration (-60%) compared with HF-fed mice. Furthermore, mice supplemented with EPA exhibited a higher  sensitivity (+24%) and glucose tolerance (+20%) compared with HF-fed mice. Similar effects were observed in EPA-supplemented Ob/Ob mice, although fat mass accumulation was not prevented. By contrast, in comparison with HF-fed mice, DHA did not prevent fat mass accumulation, increased plasma leptin concentration (+128%) in C57BL/6J mice, and did not improve glucose homeostasis in C57BL/6J and Ob/Ob mice. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, DHA stimulated leptin expression whereas EPA induced adiponectin expression, suggesting that improved leptin/adiponectin balance may contribute to the protective effect of EPA. In conclusion, supplementation with EPA, but not ALA and DHA, could preserve glucose homeostasis in an obesogenic environment and limit fat mass accumulation in the early stage of weight gain.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24844257>Both linoleic and α- prevent  but have divergent impacts on skeletal muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics in obese Zucker rats.</a></h1><p>The therapeutic use of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in preserving  sensitivity has gained interest in recent decades; however, the roles of linoleic  (LA) and α- (ALA) remain poorly understood. We investigated the efficacy of diets enriched with either LA or ALA on attenuating the development of  (IR) in obesity. Following a 12-wk intervention, LA and ALA both prevented the shift toward an IR phenotype and maintained muscle-specific  sensitivity otherwise lost in obese control animals. The beneficial effects of ALA were independent of changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity, as obese control and ALA-treated rats showed similar increases in these parameters. However, ALA increased the propensity for mitochondrial H2O2 emission and catalase content within whole muscle and reduced markers of oxidative stress (4-HNE and protein carbonylation). In contrast, LA prevented changes in markers of mitochondrial content, respiratory function, H2O2 emission, and oxidative stress in obese animals, thereby resembling levels seen in lean animals. Together, our data suggest that LA and ALA are efficacious in preventing IR but have divergent impacts on skeletal muscle mitochondrial content and function. Moreover, we propose that LA has value in preserving  sensitivity in the development of obesity, thereby challenging the classical view that n-6 PUFAs are detrimental.Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22049297>Genetic variation in stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 is associated with metabolic syndrome prevalence in Costa Rican adults.</a></h1><p>Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) activity, a key regulator of lipid metabolism, may be associated with the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS). We examined the association of genetic variation in the SCD1 gene with the occurrence of MetS and its five components in a population of Costa Rican adults (n = 2152; mean age, 58 y; range, 18-86 y). Associations of tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNP) of the SCD1 gene with prevalence of MetS and its five components were analyzed by use of log-Poisson models with robust variance estimates and linear regression models, respectively. The likelihood ratio was used to test potential gene-fatty  interactive effects with adipose tissue α-. One tagSNP (rs1502593) was significantly associated with an increased prevalence of MetS in the total study sample. Compared with the common homozygous CC genotype, the CT and TT genotypes for rs1502593 were associated with higher prevalence ratios (PR) of MetS for CT vs. CC: [PR = 1.22 (95% CI = 1.03, 1.44)] and for TT vs. CC [PR = 1.24 (95% CI = 1.01, 1.52)]. Among women, we observed borderline positive associations between systolic blood pressure and fasting blood sugar levels and rs1502593 (P = 0.05 and 0.06). Compared to the common haplotype (frequency ≥ 5%) with no minor alleles of SCD1 tagSNP, the other two observed common haplotypes carrying the rs1502593 minor allele were significantly associated with elevated prevalence of MetS. No gene-fatty  interactive effects were observed. Our results suggest that genetic variation in the SCD1 gene may play a role in the development of MetS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25916176>Activity of dietary fatty acids on FFA1 and FFA4 and characterisation of pinolenic  as a dual FFA1/FFA4 agonist with potential effect against metabolic diseases.</a></h1><p>Various foods are associated with effects against metabolic diseases such as  and type 2 diabetes; however, their mechanisms of action are mostly unclear. Fatty acids may contribute by acting as precursors of signalling molecules or by direct activity on receptors. The medium- and long-chain NEFA receptor FFA1 (free fatty  receptor 1, previously known as GPR40) has been linked to enhancement of glucose-stimulated  secretion, whereas FFA4 (free fatty  receptor 4, previously known as GPR120) has been associated with -sensitising and anti-inflammatory effects, and both receptors are reported to protect pancreatic islets and promote secretion of appetite and glucose-regulating hormones. Hypothesising that FFA1 and FFA4 mediate therapeutic effects of dietary components, we screened a broad selection of NEFA on FFA1 and FFA4 and characterised active compounds in concentration-response curves. Of the screened compounds, pinolenic , a constituent of pine nut oil, was identified as a relatively potent and efficacious dual FFA1/FFA4 agonist, and its suitability for further studies was confirmed by additional in vitro characterisation. Pine nut oil and free and esterified pure pinolenic  were tested in an acute glucose tolerance test in mice. Pine nut oil showed a moderately but significantly improved glucose tolerance compared with maize oil. Pure pinolenic  or ethyl ester gave robust and highly significant improvements of glucose tolerance. In conclusion, the present results indicate that pinolenic  is a comparatively potent and efficacious dual FFA1/FFA4 agonist that exerts antidiabetic effects in an acute mouse model. The compound thus deserves attention as a potential active dietary ingredient to prevent or counteract metabolic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260961>Phenolic, oxylipin and fatty  profiles of the Chilean hazelnut (Gevuina avellana): Antioxidant activity and inhibition of pro-inflammatory and metabolic syndrome-associated enzymes.</a></h1><p>Roasted cotyledons of the Chilean hazelnut (Gevuina avellana) are appreciated as snacks. The aim of our work was to assess the fatty , oxylipin and phenolic composition using gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), ultra- high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to MS and HPLC coupled to diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Additionally, various antioxidant activities were assessed. The inhibition of α-glucosidase, α-amylase, lipase, cyclooxygenases-1 and -2 (COX-1/COX-2), and lipoxygenase was determined. The main fatty acids were oleic and 7-hexadecenoic acids. Eight phytoprostanes and three phytofurans were identified and quantified. Hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids were the main phenolic compounds. Oils showed antioxidant activity determined by EPR, and inhibition of COX-1/COX-2. The statistical analysis showed that the roasting does not affect the composition of the samples. The occurrence of oxylipins in this species is reported for the first time. Chilean hazelnuts can be considered a source of health promoting compounds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the specific defects that precipitate these abnormalities are yet to be fully elucidated. After binding to , the plasma membrane-embedded  receptor transmembrane protein initiates a cascade of phosphorylation that leads to the activation of protein kinase B (AKT) and subsequently to the initiation of some metabolic actions of . The activities of this receptor,  binding, and tyrosine kinase activation is dependent on its plasma lipid environment. Published data on the influence of omega-3 and -6 polyunsaturated fatty acids on  response are scarce. Moreover, the findings of the published investigations, most of which used omega-3 and -6, polyunsaturated fatty- blends, have been inconclusive. Hence, further, well thought out research is needed. The aim of the current study was to elucidate the effect of treatments with linoleic  (LNA), arachidonic  (ARA),  (ALA), docoshexaenoic  (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) on cell membrane composition and consequently on the -signaling pathway and specifically AKT phosphorylation.Human colon adenocarcinoma (HT29) and liver hepatocellular (HepG2) cells were treated with or without 40 µM of LNA, ARA, ALA, EPA, or DHA for 48 h, the fatty- composition of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) from the treated cells by capillary gas liquid chromatograph. Cells were incubated for 30 min with or without human  (50 ng/mL), and the phosphorylation of AKT was assessed with the use of Western blotting.The fatty acids were incorporated in the PtdCho and PtdEtn of both cell lines, but the level of incorporation was higher in HT29. Phosphorylation of AKT increased when HT29 was treated with LNA (P < 0.05) and ARA (P < 0.01) but not with ALA, EPA, or DHA. A similar but non-significant increase in AKT phosphorylation was observed in LNA- and ARA- treated HepG2 cells.The finding of this investigation demonstrates that plasma membrane lipid bilayer enrichment with LNA or ARA treatment enhances  action by AKT activation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this cross-sectional study we aimed to investigate associations of diet with EMFA. Altogether, 1,033 randomly selected Finnish men, aged from 47 to 75 years filled in a FFQ and their EMFA composition was analyzed. Marine polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) intake correlated positively with erythrocyte eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (r(s) = 0.415 and r(s) = 0.340, respectively, P < 0.001) and inversely with all n-6 PUFA analyzed (P < 0.001). PUFA intake from spreads and cooking fats correlated positively with  (ALA), linoleic (LNA) and nervonic acids (r(s) = 0.229, r(s) = 0.160 and r(s) = 0.143, respectively, P < 0.001). Milk fat intake was associated with myristic and behenic acids (r(s) = 0.186 and r(s) = 0.132, respectively P < 0.001). Butter users had lower ALA and LNA proportions (mol%) than non-users (0.16 ± 0.04 vs. 0.19 ± 0.05, P < 0.001 and 7.77 ± 1.02 vs. 8.12 ± 1.11, P = 0.001). Higher PUFA intake from meat was related to decreased long-chain n-3 (P < 0.001) and increased n-6 PUFA (P < 0.001) proportions. In conclusion, EMFA composition reflects particularly well the intakes of n-3 PUFA, whereas other associations remained lower. Yet, all main sources of dietary fat were related with EMFA. The dietary effect on the nervonic  proportion was confirmed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23333092>Responses to oleic, linoleic and α- acids in high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet-induced metabolic syndrome in rats.</a></h1><p>We investigated the changes in adiposity, cardiovascular and liver structure and function, and tissue fatty  compositions in response to oleic -rich macadamia oil, linoleic -rich safflower oil and α--rich flaxseed oil (C18 unsaturated fatty acids) in rats fed either a diet high in simple sugars and mainly saturated fats or a diet high in polysaccharides (cornstarch) and low in fat. The fatty acids induced lipid redistribution away from the abdomen, more pronounced with increasing unsaturation; only oleic  increased whole-body adiposity. Oleic  decreased plasma total cholesterol without changing triglycerides and nonesterified fatty acids, whereas linoleic and α- acids decreased plasma triglycerides and nonesterified fatty acids but not cholesterol. α- improved left ventricular structure and function, diastolic stiffness and systolic blood pressure. Neither oleic nor linoleic  changed the left ventricular remodeling induced by high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, but both induced dilation of the left ventricle and functional deterioration in low fat-diet-fed rats. α- improved glucose tolerance, while oleic and linoleic acids increased basal plasma glucose concentrations. Oleic and α- acids, but not linoleic , normalized systolic blood pressure. Only oleic  reduced plasma markers of liver damage. The C18 unsaturated fatty acids reduced trans fatty acids in the heart, liver and skeletal muscle with lowered stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 activity index; linoleic and α- acids increased accumulation of their C22 elongated products. These results demonstrate different physiological and biochemical responses to primary C18 unsaturated fatty acids in a rat model of human metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, the results are still controversial. We aimed to investigate the association of serum phospholipid PUFAs with cardiometabolic risk through cross-sectional/experimental studies.Serum phospholipid FA compositions and cardiometabolic risk parameters were measured in controls [healthy: n=987, metabolic syndrome (MetS): n=214] and CAD patients (CAD-only: n=152, CAD+MetS: n=56). Experimental assays were performed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).Major cardiometabolic risk markers, i.e. , hs-C-reactive proteins, and malondialdehyde were higher, and adiponectin and LDL particle size were lower in CAD patients, particularly those with MetS than in healthy controls. Serum linoleic  (LA, C18:2ω-6) was lowest and dihomo-γ- acids (DGLAs, C20:3ω-6) were highest in CAD patients with MetS among the 4 groups. Docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C22:6ω-3) was lower and arachidonic  (AA, C20:4ω-6) and ω6/ω3-PUFAs were higher in CAD patients than in controls. ω3-PUFAs were significantly lower in CAD patients, particularly those with MetS than in healthy controls. Multiple regression analysis revealed that AA and DHA among serum FAs were mainly associated with the cardiometabolic risk (β'-coefficients for AA:0.336; DHA: -0.296) together with age, MetS factors, LA, DGLA and gender (r=0.529, p<0.001). Under LPS-induced stress condition, LA and DHA significantly suppressed VSMC proliferation. DHA also up-regulated the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK, and dramatically inhibited nuclear translocation of NF-κB-p65 in VSMCs.AA and DHA were mainly associated with cardiometabolic risk. Particularly, DHA may be effective on suppression of vascular proliferation and inflammation.Copyright © 2014 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Overall, there was no significant difference between SS and NASH in FA composition. Self-reported dietary intake and red blood cell FA composition were similar among the three groups.NASH patients have more metabolic abnormalities.

Furthermore, there was a strong inverse correlation between n-6 PUFA and TAG content independent of PNPLA3 genotype. In a multivariate model including liver fat content, PNPLA3 genotype and fatty  composition, two significant differences could be exclusively attributed to the PNPLA3 (I148M) minor allele: reduced stearic  and increased α- content in the hepatic TAG fraction.These changes therefore suggest a mechanism to explain the PNPLA3 (I148M)-dependent increase in liver fat content without causing .

The aim of this study was to examine the influence of ω-3 ALA on IS and adiponectin.We conducted a randomized study in patients with T2DM and assessed IS using HEC. Twenty patients with T2DM were included and randomly assigned to receive 3 g/d of ALA or placebo for 60 d, in a double-blind design. The assessment of IS by HEC was performed at baseline and after 60 d in all patients; blood samples were taken for the measurement of serum lipids, glucose, , adiponectin, and cytokines. The primary outcome variables were an increase of both glucose infusion rate (GIR) in steady state and glucose metabolization (M) by HEC. The secondary outcomes were an increase in adiponectin levels and a decrease in fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, homeostasis model assessment-estimated  (HOMA-IR) index, lipids and cytokines. The study was conducted at an academic medical center.The ALA group improved IS corrected for fat-free mass (M/FFM; P = 0.04). Both groups showed increased adiponectin after 60 d (P = 0.01), however, the increase for the ALA group was greater (P = 0.04). In the ALA group, adiponectin was positively correlated with GIR (r = 0.76; P = 0.01) and M/FFM (r = 0.62; P = 0.06), and negatively correlated with HOMA-IR (r = -0.61; P = 0.03).ω-3 ALA supplementation improved glucose homeostasis and was associated with an increase in adiponectin. Improvement in the overall metabolic profile with ω-3 ALA suggests a potential clinical utility for this agent and requires further investigation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

EPA and DHA, rather than ALA, have been the focus of research on the n-3 fatty acids, probably due to the relatively inefficient conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA in rodents and humans. This review will assess our current understanding of the effects and potential mechanisms of actions of individual n-3 fatty acids on multiple risk factors of metabolic syndrome. Evidence for pharmacological responses and the mechanism of action of each of the n-3 fatty  trio will be discussed for the major risk factors of metabolic syndrome, especially adiposity, dyslipidemia,  and diabetes, hypertension, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Metabolism of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids as well as the interactions of n-3 fatty acids with nutrients, gene expression, and disease states will be addressed to provide a rationale for the use of n-3 fatty acids to reduce the risk factors of metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Two months before insemination, the rabbits (15 animals/group) were fed different diets: commercial standard (group C), supplemented with 10% extruded linseed (group L), and 3% fish oil (group FO). The L group does showed both the highest feed intake before AI (P < 0.01) and the highest body weight (BW) throughout pregnancy (P < 0.001). The L does yielded less milk than the C does (P < 0.001); however, no differences were observed in either weight or size of litter at weaning. Regardless of diet,  concentrations and HOMA-IR values were higher during the first half of pregnancy (P < 0.001). Nevertheless, the L does showed higher mean  concentrations than FO rabbits (P < 0.01) and the lowest glucose clearance (P < 0.01) during pregnancy. On the other hand, pregnant FO rabbits showed the lowest glucose concentrations (P < 0.05) and the lowest Homeostasis model assessment values for  (HOMA-IR, P < 0.05) as well as a faster restoration of baseline glucose levels following glucose load (P < 0.001).

Although eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic , present in fish oil, have been extensively researched, much less is known about the influence of α- (ALA; present in flaxseeds), a metabolic precursor of eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic , on bone. Our objective was to evaluate the published literature and distinguish between the individual effects of flaxseed oil and flax lignans on bone to elucidate the exact role of ALA in skeletal biology. The search was conducted in several databases resulting in 129 articles of which 30 were eligible for inclusion in this review. The studies showed that consumption of whole flaxseeds did not lead to a marked improvement of osteoporotic bones in humans and animals. However, when combined with estrogen therapy, flaxseed supplementation offered an extra benefit to bone in animal models. Similar results were found in studies conducted with flaxseed oil (predominantly ALA), but the favorable role of flaxseed oil was more obvious in various pathologic conditions (kidney disease, obesity with ), resulting in improved bone properties. In contrast, despite a marginal estrogenic effect, the consumption of flax lignans resulted in little benefit to bone and the effect was limited to early life of females only in animal models. Based on the available studies, it could be concluded that supplementation with flaxseeds may contribute to some improvement in osteoporotic bone properties but the bone-protective effect may be attributed to ALA, not to the lignan fraction of flaxseeds.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

(ALA, 18:3 n-3), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6 n-3) consumption ameliorates some of these epidemics' features thus leading one to question if consumption of EPA and DHA, and their metabolic precursor ALA reduce the conversion of metabolic syndrome to type 2 diabetes and reduce the major cause of death in the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes-myocardial infarction. Contributing to myocardial infarction are metabolic syndrome's features of dyslipidemia (including elevated total cholesterol and LDL-c), oxidation, inflammation, hypertension, glucose intolerance, overweight and obesity. Inflammation, glucose and lipid levels are variously influenced by disturbances in various adipocytokines which are in turn positively impacted by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  consumption. Type 2 diabetes has all these features though elevated total cholesterol and LDL-c are rarer. It is concluded that EPA and DHA consumption significantly benefits metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes primarily in terms of dyslipidemia (particularly hypertriglyceridemia) and platelet aggregation with their impact on blood pressure, glucose control, inflammation and oxidation being less established. There is some evidence that EPA and/or DHA consumption, but no published evidence that ALA reduces conversion of metabolic syndrome to type 2 diabetes and reduces death rates due to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.

We investigated the associations of Δ-6-desaturase (D6D) and Δ-5-desaturase (D5D) activities with stroke risk factors and risk of stroke among 1842 men from the prospective, population-based Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study, aged 42-60 years and free of CVD at baseline in 1984-1989. ANCOVA and Cox regression models were used for the analyses. Whole serum desaturase activities were estimated as product:precursor ratios - γ-:linoleic  for D6D and arachidonic :dihomo-γ- for D5D. Higher D6D activity was associated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, BMI, serum  and TAG concentrations and worse homoeostatic model assessment (HOMA) indices. In contrast, higher D5D activity was associated with lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure, BMI, serum , LDL-cholesterol, TAG and C-reactive protein concentrations, higher HDL-cholesterol concentration, and better HOMA indices.

However, it is unclear to what extent desaturase activity in different lipid fractions contribute to obesity susceptibility. Our aim was to test whether desaturase activity and FA composition are linked to an obese phenotype in rats that are either obesity prone (OP) or resistant (OR) on a high-fat diet (HFD).Two groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were given ad libitum (AL-HFD) or calorically restricted (HFD-paired; pair fed to calories consumed by chow-fed rats) access to a HFD. The AL-HFD group was categorized into OP and OR sub-groups based on weight gain over 5 weeks. Five different lipid fractions were examined in OP and OR rats with regard to proportions of essential and very long-chain polyunsaturated FAs: linoleic  (LA), , eicosapentaenoic , docosahexaenoic  and the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1) product 16:1n-7. FA ratios were used to estimate activities of the delta-5-desaturase (20:4n-6/20:3n-6), delta-6-desaturase (18:3n-6/18:2n-6), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1; 16:1n-7/16:0, SCD-16 and 18:1n-9/18:0, SCD-18), de novo lipogenesis (16:0/18:2n-6) and FA elongation (18:0/16:0). Fasting , glucose, adiponectin and leptin concentrations were measured in plasma.After AL-HFD access, OP rats had a significantly higher SCD-16 index and 16:1n-7 proportion, but a significantly lower LA proportion, in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) triacylglycerols, as well as significantly higher  and leptin concentrations, compared with OR rats. No differences were found between the two phenotypes in liver (phospholipids; triacylglycerols) or plasma (cholesterol esters; phospholipids) lipid fractions or for plasma glucose or adiponectin concentrations. For the desaturase indices of the HFD-paired rats, the only significant differences compared with the OP or OR rats were higher SCD-16 and SCD-18 indices in SAT triacylglycerols in OP compared with HFD-paired rats.The higher SCD-16 may reflect higher SCD-1 activity in SAT, which in combination with lower LA proportions may reflect higher  and changes in SAT independent of other lipid fractions.

Heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochran Q statistic and quantified by the I statistic.A total of 8 trials (N = 212) were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to a control diet, a median dose of 4.4 g/day of ALA intake for a median duration of 3 months did not affect HbA1c (%) (MD = -.01; [95%: -.32, .31], P = .96).

Summary effect estimates were generally compromised by considerable and unexplained heterogeneity (I ≥75%). In the subgroup analysis of continuous predictors, a reduction in HbA1c (%) and FBG (mmol/L) was significantly associated with an increased intake of ALA.

Dietary intake, serum phospholipid FA composition and HOMA-IR were measured.Fasting  and HOMA-IR were significantly higher in the rs174575G allele carriers than the CC homozygotes, but lower in the rs2727270T allele carriers than the CC homozygotes. The proportion of linoleic  (18:2ω-6, LA) was higher in the minor allele carriers of FEN1-10154G>T, rs174575C>G and rs2727270C>T than the major homozygotes, respectively. On the other hand, the proportions of dihomo-γ- (20:3ω-6, DGLA) and arachidonic  (20:4ω-6, AA) in serum phospholipids were significantly lower in the minor allele carriers of FEN1-10154 G>T carriers and rs2727270C>T than the major homozygotes respectively. AA was also significantly lower in the rs1000778T allele carriers than the CC homozygotes. HOMA-IR positively correlated with LA and DGLA and negatively with AA/DGLA in total subjects. Interestingly, rs174575G allele carriers showed remarkably higher HOMA-IR than the CC homozygotes when subjects had higher proportions of DLGA (≥1.412% in total serum phospholipid FA composition) (P for interaction = 0.009) or of AA (≥4.573%) (P for interaction = 0.047).HOMA-IR is associated with FADS gene cluster as well as with FA composition in serum phospholipids.

T2D is caused by a combination of  and beta-cell failure and can be treated with  sensitizing drugs that target the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma. Extracts of elderflowers (Sambucus nigra) have been found to activate PPARgamma and to stimulate -dependent glucose uptake suggesting that they have a potential use in the prevention and/or treatment of . Bioassay-guided chromatographic fractionation of a methanol extract of elderflowers resulted in the identification of two well-known PPARgamma agonists;  and linoleic  as well as the flavanone naringenin. Naringenin was found to activate PPARgamma without stimulating adipocyte differentiation. However, the bioactivities of these three metabolites were not able to fully account for the observed PPARgamma activation of the crude elderflower extracts and further studies are needed to determine whether this is due synergistic effects and/or other ligand-independent mechanisms. Elderflower metabolites such as quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside, and 5-O-caffeoylquinic  were unable to activate PPARgamma. These findings suggest that flavonoid glycosides cannot activate PPARgamma, whereas some of their aglycones are potential agonists of PPARgamma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26277381>Plasma fatty acids as predictors of glycaemia and type 2 diabetes.</a></h1><p>Our aim was to investigate the fasting proportions of fatty acids and estimated desaturase and elongase activities in three different lipid fractions in plasma, phospholipids (PLs), cholesteryl esters (CEs) and triacylglycerols (TGs), as predictors for the worsening of glycaemia (area under the glucose curve in an OGTT [glucose AUC]) and incident type 2 diabetes in a 5.9 year follow-up of the Metabolic Syndrome in Men population-based cohort.Fatty  proportions were measured in plasma PL, CE and TG fractions in 1,364 Finnish men aged 45-68 years at baseline. The prospective follow-up study included only men who were non-diabetic at baseline and had data available at follow-up (n = 1,302). A total of 71 participants developed new type 2 diabetes during follow-up.After adjusting for confounding factors, total saturated fatty acids, palmitoleic  (16:1n-7), dihomo-γ- (20:3n-6) and estimated stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 and Δ(6)-desaturase (D6D) enzyme activities significantly predicted the worsening of glycaemia whereas total polyunsaturated fatty , linoleic  (18:2n-6) and elongase activity predicted a decrease in the glucose AUC. Estimated D6D activity and dihomo-γ- (20:3n-6) were associated with an increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes. Results were consistent across the three different lipid fractions. However, fatty  proportions in the PL and CE fractions were stronger predictors for glycaemia and incident type 2 diabetes compared with fatty  proportions in the TG fraction.Selected fatty  proportions of plasma lipid fractions and their ratios, which reflect desaturase and elongase enzyme activities, may be good biomarkers for the worsening of glycaemia and incident type 2 diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30349012>Effect of Pufa Substrates on Fatty  Profile of Bifidobacterium breve Ncimb 702258 and CLA/CLNA Production in Commercial Semi-Skimmed Milk.</a></h1><p>Current research on lipids is highlighting their relevant role in metabolic/signaling pathways. Conjugated fatty acids (CFA), namely isomers of linoleic and  (i.e. CLA and CLNA, respectively) can positively modulate inflammation processes and energy metabolism, promoting anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant effects, improved lipid profiles and , among others. Bioactive doses have been indicated to be above 1 g/d, yet these cannot be achieved through a moderate intake (i.e. 1-2 servings) of natural sources, and certain CLA-containing products have limited commercial availability. Such handicaps have fueled research interest in finding alternative fortification strategies. In recent years, screening of dairy products for CFA-producing bacteria has attracted much attention and has led to the identification of some promising strains, including Bifidobacterium breve NCIMB 702258. This strain has shown interesting producing capabilities in model systems as well as positive modulation of lipid metabolism activities in animal studies. Accordingly, the aim of this research work was to assay B. breve NCIMB 702258 in semi-skimmed milk to produce a probiotic fermented dairy product enriched in bioactive CLA and CLNA. The effect of substrates (LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA) on growth performance and membrane fatty acids profile was also studied, as these potential modifications have been associated to stress response. When tested in cys-MRS culture medium, LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA impaired the fatty  synthesis by B. breve since membrane concentrations for stearic and oleic acids decreased. Variations in the C18:1 c11 and lactobacillic  concentrations, may suggest that these substrates are also affecting the membrane fluidity. Bifidobacterium breve CFA production capacity was first assessed in cys-MRS with LA, α-LNA, γ-LNA or all substrates together at 0.5 mg/mL each. This strain did not produce CFA from γ-LNA, but converted 31.12% of LA and 68.20% of α-LNA into CLA and CLNA, respectively, after incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. In a second phase, B. breve was inoculated in a commercial semi-skimmed milk with LA, α-LNA or both at 0.5 mg/mL each. Bifidobacterium breve revealed a limited capacity to synthesize CLA isomers, but was able to produce 0.062-0.115 mg/mL CLNA after 24 h at 37 °C. However, organoleptic problems were reported which need to be addressed in future studies. These results show that although CFA were produced at too low concentrations to be able to achieve solely the bioactive dose in one daily portion size, fermented dairy products are a suitable vector to deliver B. breve NCIMB 702258.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26828527>Mechanisms Involved in the Improvement of Lipotoxicity and Impaired Lipid Metabolism by Dietary α- Rich Salvia hispanica L (Salba) Seed in the Heart of Dyslipemic -Resistant Rats.</a></h1><p>This study explores the mechanisms underlying the altered lipid metabolism in the heart of dyslipemic -resistant (IR) rats fed a sucrose-rich diet (SRD) and investigates if chia seeds (rich in α- 18:3, n-3 ALA) improve/reverse cardiac lipotoxicity. Wistar rats received an SRD-diet for three months. Half of the animals continued with the SRD up to month 6. The other half was fed an SRD in which the fat source, corn oil (CO), was replaced by chia seeds from month 3 to 6 (SRD+chia). A reference group consumed a control diet (CD) all the time. Triglyceride, long-chain acyl CoA (LC ACoA) and diacylglycerol (DAG) contents, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) and muscle-type carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (M-CPT1) activities and protein mass levels of M-CPT1, membrane fatty  transporter (FAT/CD36), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) were analyzed. Results show that: (a) the hearts of SRD-fed rats display lipotoxicity suggesting impaired myocardial lipid utilization; (b) Compared with the SRD group, dietary chia normalizes blood pressure; reverses/improves heart lipotoxicity, glucose oxidation, the increased protein mass level of FAT/CD36, and the impaired  stimulated FAT/CD36 translocation to the plasma membrane. The enhanced M-CPT1 activity is markedly reduced without similar changes in protein mass. PPARα slightly decreases, while the UCP2 protein level remains unchanged in all groups. Normalization of dyslipidemia and IR by chia reduces plasma fatty acids (FAs) availability, suggesting that a different milieu prevents the robust translocation of FAT/CD36. This could reduce the influx of FAs, decreasing the elevated M-CPT1 activity and lipid storage and improving glucose oxidation in cardiac muscles of SRD-fed rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26629547>Circulating Unsaturated Fatty Acids Delineate the Metabolic Status of Obese Individuals.</a></h1><p>Obesity is not a homogeneous condition across individuals since about 25-40% of obese individuals can maintain healthy status with no apparent signs of metabolic complications. The simple anthropometric measure of body mass index does not always reflect the biological effects of excessive body fat on health, thus additional molecular characterizations of obese phenotypes are needed to assess the risk of developing subsequent metabolic conditions at an individual level.To better understand the associations of free fatty acids (FFAs) with metabolic phenotypes of obesity, we applied a targeted metabolomics approach to measure 40 serum FFAs from 452 individuals who participated in four independent studies, using an ultra-performance liquid chromatograph coupled to a Xevo G2 quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometer.FFA levels were significantly elevated in overweight/obese subjects with diabetes compared to their healthy counterparts. We identified a group of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) that are closely correlated with metabolic status in two groups of obese individuals who underwent weight loss intervention and can predict the recurrence of diabetes at two years after metabolic surgery. Two UFAs, dihomo-gamma- and palmitoleic , were also able to predict the future development of metabolic syndrome (MS) in a group of obese subjects.These findings underscore the potential role of UFAs in the MS pathogenesis and also as important markers in predicting the risk of developing diabetes in obese individuals or diabetes remission after a metabolic surgery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18597758>Fatty acids induce apoptosis in human smooth muscle cells depending on chain length, saturation, and duration of exposure.</a></h1><p>Plasma free fatty  (FFA) concentrations are increased in states of . Therefore, this study evaluated apoptosis and underlying mechanisms induced by selected nutritional FFAs, a defined FFA-mix, and human plasma containing high FFA concentrations in human smooth muscle cells (HSMCs).HSMCs were incubated (24-72 h) with selected FFAs (100-300 micromol/l), an FFA-mix (palmitic-/stearic-/oleic-/linoleic-/=2.6/1/3.6/9/1; 300-900 micromol/l), or with high FFA-plasma (600 micromol/l) versus respective control cultures. Apoptosis, caspase activation, and protein expression were determined by DNA-fragmentation assays, flow cytometry, and Western blots, respectively.Exposure (24h) of HSMCs to 300 micromol/l stearic-, oleic-, linoleic-, -, and arachidonic  induced apoptosis, correlating (p<0.01) with the FFAs' chain length (r=0.602) and number of FFA double bonds (r=0.956). After 48 h, 100 micromol/l of all tested FFAs - including palmitic  - were already sufficient to trigger HSMCs' cell death. FFA-exposure resulted in activation of caspases and apoptosis was completely abolished by co-incubation with caspase inhibitors and negatively correlated (p<0.01) with the base-excision repair protein XRCC1 (r=-0.765) and with c-myc's antagonist mad (r=-0.916), whereas positive correlations (p<0.01) were found for protein expression of the proto-oncogene c-myc (r=0.972) and the transcription factor E2F-1 (r=0.971). Exposure of HSMCs to the defined FFA-mix and to plasma samples from individuals with elevated plasma FFAs supported the results obtained by defined FFA stimulation.Since smooth muscle cells surround the macrophage/foam cell/lipid-laden artheromatous core of atherosclerotic lesions with a protective fibrous cap, their FFA-induced HSMC apoptosis could contribute to progression of atherosclerosis by thinning of the fibrous cap and subsequent plaque destabilization.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752559>Clustering effects on postprandial  secretion and sensitivity in response to meals with different fatty  compositions.</a></h1><p>Dietary fatty acids play a role in glucose homeostasis. The aim of this study was to assess the individual relationship between dietary saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids with postprandial β-cell function and  sensitivity in subjects with normal and high fasting triglycerides. We assessed postprandial β-cell function (by the insulinogenic index and the ratio of the  to glucose areas under the time-concentration curve) and  sensitivity (by the oral glucose and the minimal model  sensitivity indices) over four nonconsecutive, randomly assigned, high-fat meals containing a panel of SFA (palmitic and stearic acids), MUFA (palmitoleic and oleic acids) and PUFA (linoleic and α- acids) in 14 subjects with normal and in 14 subjects with high fasting triglycerides. The proportions of each fatty  in the meals and the values for surrogate measures of postprandial β-cell function and  sensitivity were subjected to a Pearson correlation and hierarchical cluster analysis, which revealed two classes of dietary fatty acids for regulating postprandial glucose homeostasis. We successfully discriminated the adverse effects of SFA palmitic  from the beneficial effects of MUFA oleic  on postprandial β-cell function (r ≥ 0.84 for SFA palmitic  and r ≥ -0.71 for MUFA oleic ; P < 0.05) and  sensitivity (r ≥ -0.92 for SFA palmitic  and r ≥ 0.89 for MUFA oleic ; P < 0.001) both in subjects with normal and high fasting triglycerides. In conclusion, dietary MUFA oleic , in contrast to SFA palmitic , favours the tuning towards better postprandial glycaemic control in subjects with normal and high fasting triglycerides.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25935580>Association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in erythrocytes and metabolic syndrome in Chinese men and women.</a></h1><p>Evidence of an association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and metabolic syndrome (MS) is limited and inconsistent.

Other covariates were collected via interviewer-administered questionnaires.After adjusting for age and other confounders, higher levels of marine-derived n-3 PUFAs, including EPA, DPA, and DHA, were associated with a lower presence of metabolic syndrome in both men and women. The odds ratios (95 % confidence interval) for MS obtained by comparing extreme quartiles were 0.55 (0.35-0.88) (EPA), 0.54 (0.34-0.87) (DPA), 0.45 (0.27-0.73) (DHA), and 0.52 (0.32-0.84) (total n-3 PUFAs) in men (p trend <0.05 for all results); and 0.74 (0.56-0.99) (EPA), 0.73 (0.55-0.98) (DPA), 0.75 (0.56-1.02) (DHA), and 0.71 (0.53-0.96) (total n-3 PUFAs) in women, respectively.

Various (n-3) fatty acids (FA) have been reported to have antiinflammatory effects, but there is a lack of consensus in this area, particularly in regard to optimal source(s) and dose(s). This study aimed to determine the effects of high and low doses of (n-3) FA from plant and marine sources on plasma inflammatory marker concentrations. One-hundred adults with metabolic syndrome were randomly assigned to a low or high dose of plant- (2.2 or 6.6 g/d α-) or marine- (1.2 or 3.6 g/d EPA and DHA) derived (n-3) FA or placebo for 8 wk, using a parallel arm design (n = 20/arm). Fasting blood samples collected at 0, 4, and 8 wk were analyzed for concentrations of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), IL-6, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and for cardiovascular risk factors. Baseline concentrations across all 5 groups combined were (mean ± SD) 103 ± 32 ng/L for MCP-1, 1.06 ± 0.56 ng/L for IL-6, and 0.197 ± 0.041 ng/L for sICAM-1. There were no significant differences in 8-wk changes in plasma inflammatory marker concentrations among the 5 groups. Plasma TG and blood pressure decreased significantly more and the LDL cholesterol concentration increased more in the high-dose fish oil group compared to the 8-wk changes in some of the other 4 groups (P ≤ 0.04).

CVD remains the number one cause of mortality in the West, while NAFLD is the most common liver disease. Growing evidence suggests that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) influence risk factors including circulating lipids and inflammation on the development of CVD and NAFLD. N - 6 and n - 3 PUFA are comprised of distinct family members, which are increasingly recognized for their individual effects. Therefore, this review examines what is currently known about the specific effects of the major n - 3 and n - 6 PUFA on CVD and NAFLD.

FA composition was assessed in serum cholesterol esters to determine dietary fat quality (e.g. linoleic) and desaturation products (e.g. dihomo-gamma-). Desaturase indices, including stearoyl coenzymeA desaturase-1 (SCD-1), were calculated by FA product-to-precursor ratios.In linear regression analyses adjusting for lifestyle, abdominal obesity and  sensitivity, the dietary biomarker linoleic  (n-6), but not n-3 FAs, was inversely related to ALT. Desaturation products including palmitoleic, oleic, gamma- and dihomo-gamma- acids, and Delta6-desaturase and SCD-1 indices were directly related to ALT (all p<0.05). After further adjustment for factors previously linked to fatty liver (i.e. serum lipids, adiponectin concentrations), SCD-1 index (p=0.004) and  (p<0.0001) were independent determinants of ALT activity, whereas waist circumference, triglycerides, non-esterified FA and adiponectin were not.A low dietary intake of linoleic  and elevated SCD-1 index may contribute to higher ALT activity in elderly men, even independently of obesity and .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19775712>Postprandial effects of a lipid-rich meal in the rat are modulated by the degree of unsaturation of 18C fatty acids.</a></h1><p>The fatty  composition of high-fat diets is known to influence the magnitude of postprandial events that increase the risk of metabolic syndrome. These variations in magnitude may be directly ascribed to differences in the channeling of lipids toward oxidation or storage. A study was designed to compare the effects of 4 dietary fats on postprandial energy expenditure and on some risk factors of the metabolic syndrome. To avoid usual confounding factors due to simultaneous variations in chain length and double-bounds number of fatty acids, dietary fats were chosen to provide mainly 18-carbon fatty acids with 0 (stearic  [SA]), 1 (oleic  [OA]), 2 (linoleic  [LA]), or 3 ( [ALA]) double bounds. They were given as single high-fat test meals to 4 different groups of male rats. The resting metabolic rate and the lipid and carbohydrate oxidation were measured from oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production using indirect calorimetry 2 hours before and 6.5 hours after the test meal. Plasma glucose, triglyceride, and chylomicron concentrations were determined at 0, 1.5, and 4 hours after the test meal. Postprandial concentration of glucose and triglyceride did not vary with the nature of the test meals, whereas that of chylomicrons was the highest after the LA test meal and the lowest after the SA test meal. Postprandial increase in resting metabolic rate was the highest after the LA and OA test meals, and the lowest after the SA and ALA test meals. Compared with the 3 other diets, the ALA test meal enhanced lipid oxidation and decreased glucose oxidation during the early postprandial period (0.25-3.25 hours). This suggests that stearic  may not induce all the adverse effects classically described for other saturated fatty acids and that  may beneficially influence energy partitioning, especially during the early postprandial state.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The association of a combination of fatty acids with incident type 2 diabetes (T2D) has not been evaluated.We measured plasma phospholipid fatty acids by gas chromatography in 27,296 adults, including 12,132 incident cases of T2D, over the follow-up period between baseline (1991-1998) and 31 December 2007 in 8 European countries in EPIC-InterAct, a nested case-cohort study. The first principal component derived by principal component analysis of 27 individual fatty acids (mole percentage) was the main exposure (subsequently called the fatty  pattern score [FA-pattern score]). The FA-pattern score was partly characterised by high concentrations of linoleic , stearic , odd-chain fatty acids, and very-long-chain saturated fatty acids and low concentrations of γ-, palmitic , and long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids, and it explained 16.1% of the overall variability of the 27 fatty acids. Based on country-specific Prentice-weighted Cox regression and random-effects meta-analysis, the FA-pattern score was associated with lower incident T2D. Comparing the top to the bottom fifth of the score, the hazard ratio of incident T2D was 0.23 (95% CI 0.19-0.29) adjusted for potential confounders and 0.37 (95% CI 0.27-0.50) further adjusted for metabolic risk factors. The association changed little after adjustment for individual fatty acids or fatty  subclasses. In cross-sectional analyses relating the FA-pattern score to metabolic, genetic, and dietary factors, the FA-pattern score was inversely associated with adiposity, triglycerides, liver enzymes, C-reactive protein, a genetic score representing , and dietary intakes of soft drinks and alcohol and was positively associated with high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and intakes of polyunsaturated fat, dietary fibre, and coffee (p < 0.05 each). Limitations include potential measurement error in the fatty acids and other model covariates and possible residual confounding.A combination of individual fatty acids, characterised by high concentrations of linoleic , odd-chain fatty acids, and very long-chain fatty acids, was associated with lower incidence of T2D.

Their effects as regulators of lipid and glucose metabolism are well documented. They also appear to affect protein metabolism, especially by acting on  sensitivity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of n-3 PUFA, i.e. the precursor α- (ALA) 18:3n-3 or long-chain PUFA (LC-PUFA), in chickens, by focusing on their potential function as co-regulators of the  anabolic signalling cascade. Ross male broilers were divided into six dietary treatment groups. Diets were isoproteic (22 % crude protein) and isoenergetic (12·54 MJ metabolisable energy/kg) and contained similar lipid levels (6 %) provided by different proportions of various lipid sources: oleic sunflower oil rich in 18:1n-9 as control; fish oil rich in LC-PUFA; rapeseed and linseed oils providing ALA. The provision of diets enriched with n-3 PUFA, i.e. rich in LC-PUFA or in the precursor ALA, for 3 weeks improved the growth performance of chickens, whereas that of only the ALA diet enhanced the development of the pectoralis major muscle. At 23 d of age, we studied the  sensitivity of the pectoralis major muscle and liver of chickens after an intravenous injection of  or saline. The present results indicate that the activation patterns of n-3 PUFA are different in the liver and muscles. An ALA-enriched diet may improve  sensitivity in muscles, with greater activation of the -induced 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase/ribosomal protein S6 pathway involved in the translation of mRNA into proteins, thereby potentially increasing muscle protein synthesis and growth.

Results were compared with Dietary Reference Intakes and Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines. Plasma vitamin C was measured to assess food record accuracy.Intake/activity for each participant was compared with the recommendations and proportion of subjects not meeting the requirements was calculated. Groups were compared by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test or z-test with Bonferroni adjustment.More patients with NASH (58.5%) were obese compared with patients with simple steatosis (24.2%) and healthy controls (7.4%; P<0.01). Patients with NAFLD showed more  than healthy controls. The reported energy intake was below estimated requirements in all groups (P≤0.001). The proportion of subjects from each group exceeding acceptable energy intake from fat was as follows: simple steatosis: 27.3%; NASH: 46.3%; healthy controls: 63.0% (simple steatosis vs health controls; P<0.05) and from saturated fat: simple steatosis: 42.4%; NASH: 70.7%; healthy controls: 63.0% (simple steatosis vs. NASH; P<0.05). In each group, >80% of subjects did not consume enough linoleic or , vitamin D, and vitamin E, and >60% exceeded the upper intake level for sodium. Only 53.1% of patients with simple steatosis and 53.8% of patients with NASH, but 84.6% of healthy controls, met recommendations for physical activity (P=0.020). Plasma vitamin C was normal, similar among groups, and correlated with vitamin C intakes.All participants followed a similar Western diet with high fat and sodium intakes and suboptimal micronutrient intakes.

Adherence to these recommendations allows not only to stop the progression of a disease but also to improve the overall health of elderly patients.The aim of this study was to analyze differences in nutrition of elderly patients, with emphasis on the implementation of nutritional recommendations both for healthy people and for patients with cardiometabolic disorders.Based on a 24-hour recall questionnaire of 239 volunteers (mean age, 72 ±9.34 years) and using the Diet 5.0 software, we analyzed in detail the pattern of consumption of various nutrients.Compared with the recommendations of the World Health Organization and cardiology associations, more than 90% of the population did not cover the demand for calcium, potassium, vitamin D, folic , and α-. The intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids, sodium, magnesium, fiber, water, and vitamin C was slightly higher. The appropriate intake was observed only in a diet of 15% to 40% of the subjects. The most significant differences were demonstrated for the coexisting diseases and the intake level of sodium, polyunsaturated fatty acids (particularly docosahexaenoic ) vitamin C, iron, fiber, lauric , and sucrose. The diet of patients with hypercholesterolemia was the least deficient, while deficiencies were the most common in patients with a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure.Nutrition of geriatric patients is inadequate. Their diet is profoundly deficient in nutrients, and these deficiencies further deteriorate in the presence of cardiovascular or metabolic diseases. Our results indicate the need for education among elderly patients in terms of proper eating habits and, possibly, individual supplementation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29298969>[Dietetary recommendation for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease].</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common chronic liver disease in the developed world. Nowadays, in the adult population of Europe it is estimated at 14% to 21%. Its most important risk factors are obesity and metabolic syndrome. Introducing lifestyle changes such as: dietary intervention and increased physical activity are the first-line treatment and are intended to support not only NAFLD but also associated diseases such as obesity, , diabetes and dyslipidemia. Dietary management focuses on weight reduction of overweight or obese people by decreasing energy in diet. It is recommended to limit the intake of saturated fats and trans fatty acids as well as cholesterol. Instead, it is important to increase the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty  diets, mainly from the n-3 family, which exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. It is also beneficial to eat nuts, despite their high energy value, as a source of , which lowers LDL cholesterol. It is important to increase the share of vegetable protein (eg. soya) and limit the intake of fat meat, milk and the dairy products. A key role in the treatment and prevention of NAFLD is also a reduction of simple sugars and total exclusion of added sugar in the diet. The rise of NAFLD in developed countries is analogous to the increase of fructose consumption, which high intake is directly indicated as the main cause of the disease. Choosing foods with high fiber content, low glycemic index and meals composed with low glycemic load, is conducive to weight reduction. An important role in supporting NAFLD treatment is also attributed to vitamin D, C and E supplementation and some probiotic bacteria, as well as cinnamon and turmeric, which improve  sensitivity. Daily physical activity is strongly recommended as the supplement of healthy lifestyle.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21046125>Unsaturated fatty acids repress the expression of adipocyte fatty  binding protein via the modulation of histone deacetylation in RAW 264.7 macrophages.</a></h1><p>Adipocyte fatty  binding protein (A-FABP) present in macrophages has been implicated in the integration of lipid metabolism and inflammatory response, contributing to development of  and atherosclerosis.This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the role of fatty acids in the inflammatory pathways is mediated through the modulation of A-FABP expression in macrophages.Murine RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated with inflammatory insults and fatty acids for quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. The cells were treated with trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, for elucidating mechanisms for the regulation of A-FABP expression by fatty acids. RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down A-FABP was utilized to assess its role in inflammatory gene expression.When RAW 264.7 were incubated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS; 100 ng/ml) or 2.5 ng/ml of tumor necrosis factor α for 18 h, A-FABP mRNA and protein levels were drastically increased. Unsaturated fatty acids (100 μmol/l in complexed with BSA) such as palmitoleic , oleic , linoleic , , and eicosapentaenoic , significantly repressed the basal as well as LPS-induced A-FABP expression, whereas palmitic  did not elicit the same effect. TSA increased A-FABP mRNA levels and abolished the repressive effect of linoleic  on A-FABP expression in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated macrophages. Depletion of A-FABP expression by 70-80% using RNAi markedly decreased cyclooxygenase 2 mRNA abundance and potentiated the repression by linoleic .Unsaturated fatty acids inhibited the basal as well as LPS-induced A-FABP expression. The mechanism may involve histone deacetylation and anti-inflammatory effect of unsaturated fatty acids may be at least in part attributed to their repression of A-FABP expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518348>Plasma phospholipid n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in relation to cardiometabolic markers and gestational diabetes: A longitudinal study within the prospective NICHD Fetal Growth Studies.</a></h1><p>Despite dietary recommendations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) for cardiometabolic health, n-3 and n-6 PUFAs and their interplay in relation to diabetes risk remain debated. Importantly, data among pregnant women are scarce. We investigated individual plasma phospholipid n-3 and n-6 PUFAs in early to midpregnancy in relation to subsequent risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).Within the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Fetal Growth Studies-Singleton Cohort (n = 2,802), individual plasma phospholipid n-3 and n-6 PUFAs levels were measured at gestational weeks (GWs) 10-14, 15-26, 23-31, and 33-39 among 107 GDM cases (ascertained on average at GW 27) and 214 non-GDM controls. Conditional logistic regression was used, adjusting for major risk factors for GDM. After adjusting for covariates, individual n-3 eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were inversely correlated with  markers, whereas individual n-6 dihomo-gamma- (DGLA) was positively correlated with  markers. At GW 15-26, a standard deviation (SD) increase in total n-3 PUFAs and individual n-3 DPA was associated with a 36% (adjusted odds ratio 0.64; 95% CI 0.42-0.96; P = 0.042) and 33% (0.67; 95% CI 0.45-0.99; P = 0.047) lower risk of GDM, respectively; however, the significance did not persist after post hoc false-discovery rate (FDR) correction (FDR-corrected P values > 0.05). Associations between total n-6 PUFAs and GDM were null, whereas associations with individual n-6 PUFAs were differential. Per SD increase, gamma- (GLA) at GWs 10-14 and DGLA at GWs 10-14 and 15-26 were significantly associated with a 1.40- to 1.95-fold higher risk of GDM, whereas docosatetraenoic  (DTA) at GW 15-26 was associated with a 45% (0.55; 95% CI 0.37-0.83) lower risk of GDM (all FDR-corrected P values < 0.05). Null associations were observed for linoleic  (LA) in either gestational window in relation to risk of GDM. Women with high (≥median) n-3 PUFAs and low (<median) n-6 PUFAs levels had a 64% (95% CI 0.14-0.95; P value = 0.039) lower risk of GDM versus women with low n-3 and high n-6 PUFAs. Limitations include the inability to distinguish between exogenous and endogenous influences on circulating PUFA levels and the lack of causality inherent in observational studies.Our findings may suggest a potential role of primarily endogenously metabolized plasma phospholipid n-6 PUFAs including GLA, DGLA, and DTA in early to midpregnancy in the development of GDM. Null findings on primarily diet-derived n-3 EPA and DHA and n-6 LA do not provide strong evidence to suggest a beneficial role in prevention of GDM, although not excluding the potential benefit of EPA and DHA on glucose- homeostasis given the inverse associations with  markers.

To avoid reporting bias, different dietary biomarkers (DBs) could be used instead of self-reported data. However, few studies investigated a combination of DBs to assess compliance and its influence on cardiometabolic risk factors. The objectives of this study were to use a combination of DBs to assess compliance and to investigate how a healthy Nordic diet (ND) influences cardiometabolic risk factors in participants with high apparent compliance compared with the whole study population. From a recently conducted isocaloric randomized trial, SYSDIET (Systems Biology in Controlled Dietary Interventions and Cohort Studies), in 166 individuals with metabolic syndrome, several DBs were assessed to reflect different key components of the ND: canola oil (serum phospholipid α-), fatty fish [eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA)], vegetables (plasma β-carotene), and whole grains (plasma alkylresorcinols). High-fat dairy intake (expectedly low in the ND) was reflected by serum pentadecanoic . All participants with biomarker data (n = 154) were included in the analyses. Biomarkers were combined by using a biomarker rank score (DB score) and principal component analysis (PCA). The DB score was then used to assess compliance. During the intervention, median concentrations of alkylresorcinols, α-, EPA, and DHA were >25% higher in the ND individuals than in the controls (P < 0.05), whereas median concentrations of pentadecanoic  were 14% higher in controls (P < 0.05). Median DB score was 57% higher in the ND than in controls (P < 0.001) during the intervention, and participants were ranked similarly by DB score and PCA score. Overall, estimates of group difference in cardiometabolic effects generally appeared to be greater among compliant participants than in the whole study population (e.g., estimates of treatment effects on blood pressure and lipoproteins were ∼1.5- to 2-fold greater in the most compliant participants), suggesting that poor compliance attenuated the dietary effects. With adequate consideration of their limitations, DB combinations (e.g., DB score) could be useful for assessing compliance in intervention studies investigating cardiometabolic effects of healthy dietary patterns.

One fenugreek TG was purified using a bioassay-guided fractionation and administrated to surviving diabetic rats. The free fatty acids percentage as well as, the peroxide, the saponification and the iodine values were 2%, 12 mequiv. O/kg of oil, 189 (mg KOH/g) and 110 (g/100 g of oil), respectively.  (C 26.14%), Linoleic  (C 41.13%) and Oleic  (C 17.07%) were the dominant fatty acids in the FSO. β-sitosterol was the major sterol (85.3%) in the FSO. LnLnO (17.1%), LLL (16.6%), OLL and OOLn (8.4%), were the abundant triglycerides. The hexane extract of fenugreek seed (exhibiting the powerful inhibitory activity against alpha-amylase) was purified using a bioassay-guided fractionation affording one fenugreek TG: (11Z)-11- eicosenoic  2, 3- bis[((9Z, 12Z, 15Z)-1-oxo-9, 12, 15-octadecatrien-1-yl)oxy] propyl ester. In diabetic rats, the administration of the fenugreek TG inhibited α-amylase activity in small intestine by 36% as compared to untreated diabetic rats. Moreover, fenugreek TG increased  sensibility which leads to decrease in blood glucose level by 43%. In addition, this study demonstrated that administration of pure fenugreek TG to diabetic rats ameliorated the glycogen rate in liver and muscle. In addition, the administration of fenugreek TG reverted back the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme respectively in kidney and plasma by 33 and 29%. Interestingly, the fenugreek TG inhibited lipase activity in small intestine by 33% which leads to the regulation of lipid profile. Moreover, the fenugreek TG protected liver-kidney function evidenced by histological study. In conclusion, our finding demonstrates that the administration of fenugreek TG to diabetic rats can make it a potential candidate for industrial application as a pharmacological agent for the treatment of hyperglycemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24720591>Polyunsaturated fatty acids in pregnancy and metabolic syndrome: a review.</a></h1><p>This review presents available evidence for possible application of n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in pregnant obese women with metabolic syndrome (MS) and focuses on prophylaxis of pregnancy complications associated with MS such as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFAs has recently become popular and their adequate intake during pregnancy and early childhood is of clinical importance. The results of experimental and epidemiological investigations reveal that n-3 PUFAs, especially α-  (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), may decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases. It is believed that n-3 PUFAs affect a multitude of molecular pathways, involving regulation of gene expression, alteration of physical and chemical properties of cellular membranes and modulation of membrane channels and proteins. A large body of evidence focuses on anti-inflammatory properties of PUFAs which seem to be fundamental in prevention and reversing of , atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, thromboembolism and in improving vascular function. Despite the potential PUFAs benefits of decreasing , their application in order to prevent preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnant women with MS has not yet been established. Numerous reports have revealed that appropriate fetal development, including neuronal, retinal and immune function depends on EPA and DHA which are crucial also for prevention of preterm birth. Thus the supplementation with EPA and DHA is highly recommended during pregnancy although the optimal dosing and treatment strategies still need to be determined.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19144731>Does genetic variation in the Delta6-desaturase promoter modify the association between  and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome?</a></h1><p>Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) are associated with protection against components of the metabolic syndrome, but the role of  (ALA), the metabolic precursor of EPA and DHA, has not been studied. The Delta(6)-desaturase enzyme converts ALA into EPA and DHA, and genetic variation in the Delta(6)-desaturase gene (FADS2) may affect this conversion.We hypothesize that high ALA is associated with a lower prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and that genetic variation in FADS2 modifies this association.We studied 1815 Costa Rican adults. Adipose tissue ALA was used as a biomarker of intake, and metabolic syndrome was identified with the definition from the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III. Prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% CIs were estimated from binomial regression models, and the likelihood ratio was used to test for effect modification.High concentrations of adipose tissue ALA were associated with lower PRs of the metabolic syndrome compared with low ALA (0.81; 95% CI: 0.66, 1.00, for the comparison between the highest and the lowest quintiles; P for trend < 0.02). Higher concentrations of adipose tissue ALA were associated with a lower PR among homozygote (0.67; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.86) and heterozygote (0.84; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.99) carriers of the FADS2 T allele, but not among homozygote carriers of the deletion variant allele (0.99; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.27; P for interaction: 0.08).Elevated ALA concentrations in adipose tissue are associated with lower prevalence of the metabolic syndrome. A lack of association among homozygote carriers of the FADS2 deletion allele suggests that this association may be due in part to the conversion of ALA into EPA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20619626>Effects of weight loss on erythrocyte membrane composition and fluidity in overweight and moderately obese women.</a></h1><p>A previous study showed chemical and physical impairment of the erythrocyte membrane of overweight and moderately obese women. The present study investigated the effects of a low-calorie diet (800 kcal/day deficit for 8 weeks) on erythrocyte membrane properties in 70 overweight and moderately obese (body mass index, 25-33 kg/m(2)) normotensive, nondiabetic women. At the end of dietary intervention, 24.3% of women dropped out, 45.7% lost less than 5% of their initial weight (Group I) and only 30% of patients lost at least 5% of their initial body weight (Group II). Group I showed no significant changes in erythrocyte membrane composition and function. The erythrocyte membranes of Group II showed significant reductions in malondialdehyde, lipofuscin, cholesterol, sphingomyelin, palmitic  and nervonic  and an increase in di-homo-γ-, arachidonic  and membrane fluidity. Moreover, Group II showed an improvement in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glycemia and .

Subjects received a 2-week wash-in diet rich in monounsaturated fatty acids followed by experimental diets enriched with equal amounts of ALA, EPA, or DHA for 3 weeks. Mean dietary intake of ALA in the ALA group was 6.0 g/day (2.5% of energy intake), mean intake of EPA in the EPA group was 2.8 g/day (1.1% of energy intake) and mean intake of DHA in the DHA group was 2.9 g/day (1.1% of energy intake).Fasting serum concentrations of  and fructosamine and of HbA1c did not change significantly after consuming the ALA, EPA or DHA diet.

However, relationships between fatty acids and locomotor system dysfunctions in elderly population remain controversial. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of fatty  quality on the age related evolution of the locomotor system and to understand which aging mechanisms are involved. In order to analyze age related complications, the SAMP8 mouse strain was chosen as a progeria model as compared to the SAMR1 control strain. Then, two months old mice were divided in different groups and subjected to the following diets : (1) standard "growth" diet - (2) "sunflower" diet (high ω6/ω3 ratio) - (3) "borage" diet (high γ-) - (4) "fish" diet (high in long chain ω3). Mice were fed ad libitum through the whole protocol. At 12 months old, the mice were sacrificed and tissues were harvested for bone studies, fat and muscle mass measures, inflammation parameters and bone cell marker expression. We demonstrated for the first time that borage and fish diets restored inflammation and bone parameters using an original model of senile osteoporosis that mimics clinical features of aging in humans. Therefore, our study strongly encourages nutritional approaches as relevant and promising strategies for preventing aged-related locomotor dysfunctions.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFA) may prevent lipotoxicity and IR.

C2C12 myotubes were treated with 500 μM of PAL without or with 50 μM of  (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) or docosahexaenoic  (DHA) for 16 h. PAL decreased -dependent AKT activation and glucose uptake and increased the synthesis of ceramides and diglycerides (DG) derivatives, leading to protein kinase Cθ activation. EPA and DHA, but not ALA, prevented PAL-decreased AKT activation but glucose uptake was restored to control values by all n-3PUFA vs. PAL. Total DG and ceramide contents were decreased by all n-3PUFA, but only EPA and DHA increased PAL β-oxidation, decreased PAL incorporation into DG and reduced protein kinase Cθ activation. EPA and DHA emerge as better candidates than ALA to improve fatty  metabolism in skeletal muscle cells, notably via their ability to increase mitochondrial β-oxidation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the study was to examine the effects of an energy-restricted diet enriched with ALA on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in patients with metabolic syndrome.The present analysis compared the effects of a hypoenergetic diet high in ALA (3.4 g/d) with a control diet low in ALA (0.9 g/d) on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in 81 overweight or obese patients with features of metabolic syndrome.After a 26-wk intervention, concentration of ALA in serum phospholipids remained constant in both diet groups. The control group had a significant decrease in serum phospholipid eicosapentaenoic  concentration, although no significant intergroup difference was observed. Serum phospholipid docosahexaenoic  concentration significantly decreased to a similar extent with both interventions. Additionally, both interventions significantly decreased serum phospholipid concentrations of palmitic , stearic , total saturated fatty acids, linoleic , total ω-6 and ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, with no effect of diet group on these changes. Compared with the ALA diet, the control diet led to a significant increase in serum phospholipid oleic  concentration.Daily intake of 3.4 g of ALA during a 26-wk energy-restricted diet did not lead to an enrichment of serum phospholipids with ALA and did not increase eicosapentaenoic  due to conversion.

The long-term (6- and 12-month) use of ω-3 PUFA from the king crab hepatopancreas had a positive impact in modifying the lipid FA composition of red blood cells and in eliminating deficiencies of physiologically important ω-3 and ω-6 PUFAs in the blood cells.The findings suggest that FAs and their metabolites play an important role in the pathogenesis of MS and that dietary ω-3 PUFA should be incorporated into a package of preventive and therapeutic measures for MS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23456976>N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: relationship to inflammation in healthy adults and adults exhibiting features of metabolic syndrome.</a></h1><p>Individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS) have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, therefore, research has been directed at reducing various components that contribute to MetS and associated metabolic impairments, including chronic low-grade inflammation. Epidemiological, human, animal and cell culture studies provide evidence that dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), including  (18:3n-3, ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (20:5n-3, EPA) and/or docosahexaenoic  (22:6n-3, DHA) may improve some of the components associated with MetS. The current review will discuss recent evidence from human observational and intervention studies that focused on the effects of ALA, EPA or DHA on inflammatory markers in healthy adults and those with one or more features of MetS. Observational studies in healthy adults support the recommendation that a diet rich in n-3 fatty acids may play a role in preventing and reducing inflammation, whereas intervention studies in healthy adults have yielded inconsistent results. The majority of intervention studies in adults with features of MetS have reported a benefit for some inflammatory measures; however, other studies using high n-3 fatty  doses and long supplementation periods have reported no effect. Overall, the data reviewed herein support recommendations for regular fatty fish consumption and point toward health benefits in terms of lowering inflammation in adults with one or more features of MetS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30630554>Dietary fat composition: replacement of saturated fatty acids with PUFA as a public health strategy, with an emphasis on α-.</a></h1><p>SFA intakes have decreased in recent years, both in Ireland and across other European countries; however a large proportion of the population are still not meeting the SFA recommendation of &lt;10% of total energy (TE). High SFA intakes have been associated with increased CVD and type-2 diabetes (T2D) risk, due to alterations in cholesterol homoeostasis and adipose tissue inflammation. PUFA, in particular EPA and DHA, have been associated with health benefits, including anti-inflammatory effects. It is well established that dietary fat composition plays an important role in biological processes. A recent review of evidence suggests that replacement of SFA with PUFA has potential to reduce risk of CVD and T2D. The public health and molecular impact of EPA and DHA have been well-characterised, while less is known of effects of α- (ALA). The current dietary guideline for ALA is 0·5% TE; however evidence from supplementation trials suggests that benefit is observed at levels greater than 2 g/d (0·6-1% TE). This review highlights the gap in the evidence base relating to effects of the replacement of SFA with ALA, identifying the need for randomised controlled trials to determine the optimal dose of ALA substitution to define the efficacy of dietary fat modification with ALA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23026492>Effects of ALA, EPA and DHA in high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet-induced metabolic syndrome in rats.</a></h1><p>We compared the cardiovascular, hepatic and metabolic responses to individual dietary n-3 fatty acids (α-, ALA; eicosapentaenoic , EPA; and docosahexaenoic , DHA) in a high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet-induced model of metabolic syndrome in rats. Additionally, we measured fatty  composition of plasma, adipose tissue, liver, heart and skeletal muscle in these rats. The same dosages of ALA and EPA/DHA produced different physiological responses to decrease the risk factors for metabolic syndrome. ALA did not reduce total body fat but induced lipid redistribution away from the abdominal area and favorably improved glucose tolerance,  sensitivity, dyslipidemia, hypertension and left ventricular dimensions, contractility, volumes and stiffness. EPA and DHA increased sympathetic activation, reduced the abdominal adiposity and total body fat and attenuated  sensitivity, dyslipidemia, hypertension and left ventricular stiffness but not glucose tolerance. However, ALA, EPA and DHA all reduced inflammation in both the heart and the liver, cardiac fibrosis and hepatic steatosis. These effects were associated with complete suppression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 activity. Since the physiological responses to EPA and DHA were similar, it is likely that the effects are mediated by DHA with EPA serving as a precursor. Also, ALA supplementation increased DHA concentrations but induced different physiological responses to EPA and DHA. This result strongly suggests that ALA has independent effects in metabolic syndrome, not relying on its metabolism to DHA.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Due to its increasing prevalence, it has become an important public health concern. Altered fatty  (FA) composition and desaturase activities have been associated with several metabolic diseases, including MetS. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship of the plasma FA profile and desaturase activities with the MetS in a Mediterranean population at high risk of CVD.Baseline data from 427 participants aged 55-80 years who took part in the interventional PREDIMED study were obtained. Individual FA was determined in plasma and desaturase activities were estimated from product/precursor ratios. Odds ratios (OR) and partial correlation coefficients were used to examine these relations with MetS and its components, respectively.We found higher levels of C14:0, C16:0, C16:1n-7, estimated Δ(9)- or stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), and estimated Δ(6) desaturase (D6D), and lower levels of C18:2n-6 in people with MetS compared to those without it. After adjustment for several confounders, only higher quartiles of C14:0, C16:0, C16:1n-7, and D6D were found to be associated with an increasing prevalence of MetS, while higher quartiles of C18:2n-6 were inversely associated with MetS. High proportions of C14:0, C16:0, C16:1n-7, C20:3n-6, SCD, and D6D, and decreased proportions of C18:2n-6 and estimated Δ(5)-desaturase (D5D) were associated with adverse profiles of several metabolic risk factors. Women showed more unhealthy FA pattern and lipid profiles than men, but only among those with MetS.A FA composition and estimated desaturase activities consisting in high levels of SFA, SCD and D6D, and low levels of PUFA and D5D are associated with increased MetS probability and are characteristic of people presenting MetS, especially women. These findings support those observed in non-Mediterranean populations in which an altered FA profile and estimated desaturase activities are associated with MetS.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

This study investigates the impact of substitution of linoleic  with α- (ALA) or long chain (LC) n-3 PUFA and hence decreasing n-6:n-3 fatty  ratio on high fat, high fructose (HFHF) diet induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups and fed control diet, HFHF diet (n-6:n-3 ratio of 200), HFHF diet with ALA (n-6:n-3 ratio of 2) or HFHF diet with LC n-3 PUFA (n-6:n-3 ratio of 5) for 24 weeks. Rats fed HFHF diet with n-6:n-3 ratio of 200 resulted in hepatic steatosis, induced glucose intolerance,  and oxidative stress accompanied by increase in markers of inflammation, plasma lipids and aminotransferase levels. Histopathological examination of liver further confirmed the establishment of NASH. ALA and LC n-3 PUFA supplementation prevented hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia by inhibiting lipogenesis and increasing  sensitivity. Furthermore, n-3 PUFA supplementation attenuated hepatic oxidative stress by restoring antioxidant status, decreased inflammation and preserved hepatic architecture. These finding suggest that decreasing n-6:n-3 ratio prevented HFHF induced NASH by attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25687616>18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids ameliorate palmitate-induced inflammation and  in mouse C2C12 myotubes.</a></h1><p>Skeletal muscle is a major site of  action. Intramuscular lipid accumulation results in inflammation, which has a strong correlation with skeletal muscle  (IR). The aim of this study was to explore the effects of linoleic , , and gamma- (GLA), 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), on palmitic  (PA)-induced inflammatory responses and IR in C2C12 myotubes. Our data demonstrated that these three test 18-carbon PUFAs can inhibit PA-induced interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and IR as evidenced by increases in phosphorylated AKT and the 160-kD AKT substrate, mRNA and plasma membrane protein expression of glucose transporter 4, and glucose uptake. Moreover, the 18-carbon PUFAs blocked the effects of PA on activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Of note, supplementation with GLA-rich borage oil decreased proinflammatory cytokine production and hindered the activation of MAPKs, PKC-θ and NF-κB in the skeletal muscles of diabetic mice. The 18-carbon PUFAs did not reverse PA-induced inflammation or IR in C2C12 myotubes transfected with a constitutively active mutant IκB kinase-β plasmid, which suggests the importance of the inhibition of NF-κB activation by the 18-carbon PUFAs. Moreover, blockade of AMPK activation by short hairpin RNA annulled the inhibitory effects of the 18-carbon PUFAs on PA-induced IR but not inflammation. Our findings suggest that the 18-carbon PUFAs may be useful in the management of PA-induced inflammation and IR in myotubes.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We quantitatively determined 11 FFAs, seven cytokine/adipokine, homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) and C-peptide levels from the fasting blood samples that were collected at 16 weeks of gestation. Multivariate analyses were performed along with separate analyses for each individual FFA.High HOMA-IR (p<0.001) and C-peptide (p<0.0001) levels were positively associated with a twofold to fourfold increased risk for developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Negative relationships were found with specific FFAs (molecular percentage, palmitoleic, oleic, , myristic acids) and HOMA-IR and C-peptide levels (p<0.01 to p<0.0001). In contrast, palmitic, stearic, arachidonic, dihomo-γ- (DGLA) and docosahexaenoic acids were positively associated with HOMA-IR and C-peptide (p<0.01 to p<0.0001). The individual FFAs also predicted cytokine/adipokine levels. For example, women who had elevated DGLA (highest quartile) were twice as (adjusted OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.98) likely to have higher interleukin (IL)-8 (p<0.0001) levels. Conversely, women with high palmitoleic, oleic, and  levels had reduced odds (≥2-fold, p<0.01 to p<0.001) for having higher IL-8, IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels.Our results suggest that maternal individual FFAs uniquely affect  and secretion. The effects are either direct or indirect via modulation of the inflammatory response.

Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) in particular have been studied extensively, whereas substantive evidence for a biological role for the precursor,  (ALA), is lacking. It is not enough to assume that ALA exerts effects through conversion to EPA and DHA, as the process is highly inefficient in humans. Thus, clarification of ALA's involvement in health and disease is essential, as it is the principle n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  consumed in the North American diet and intakes of EPA and DHA are typically very low. There is evidence suggesting that ALA, EPA and DHA have specific and potentially independent effects on chronic disease. Therefore, this review will assess our current understanding of the differential effects of ALA, EPA and DHA on cancer, , and cardiovascular disease. Potential mechanisms of action will also be reviewed. Overall, a better understanding of the individual role for ALA, EPA and DHA is needed in order to make appropriate dietary recommendations regarding n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  consumption.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25030769>Dietary enrichment with  during pregnancy attenuates  in adult offspring in mice.</a></h1><p>Our objective was to test the contribution of dietary enrichment in essential or saturated fatty acids, in normocaloric diets, on the lipid accumulation and  in the adult offspring in a C57Bl6/J mice model.Pregnant mothers were fed normocaloric diets containing 6% fat enriched in essential fatty acids (EFA):  (ALA-18:3, n-3), linoleic (LA-18:2, n-6), or saturated fatty acids (SFA). After a washing-out period with regular diet, the offspring received a high-fat diet before euthanization.Adult mice fed maternal ALA showed lower body weight gain and lower liver fat accumulation, lower HOMA index and lower stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) activity than those fed maternal SFA.The results observed using this novel model suggest that ALA in maternal diet may have the potential to inhibit  in adult offspring.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28965129>α- supplementation prevents exercise-induced improvements in white adipose tissue mitochondrial bioenergetics and whole-body glucose homeostasis in obese Zucker rats.</a></h1><p>While the underlying mechanisms in the development of  remain inconclusive, metabolic dysfunction in both white adipose tissue (WAT) and skeletal muscle have been implicated in the process. Therefore, we investigated the independent and combined effects of α- (ALA) supplementation and exercise training on whole-body glucose homeostasis and mitochondrial bioenergetics within the WAT and skeletal muscle of obese Zucker rats.We randomly assigned obese Zucker rats to receive a control diet alone or supplemented with ALA and to remain sedentary or undergo exercise training for 4 weeks (CON-Sed, ALA-Sed, CON-Ex and ALA-Ex groups). Whole-body glucose tolerance was determined in response to a glucose load. Mitochondrial content and bioenergetics were examined in skeletal muscle and epididymal WAT (eWAT).  sensitivity and cellular stress were assessed by western blot.Exercise training independently improved whole-body glucose tolerance as well as -induced signalling in muscle and WAT. However, the consumption of ALA during exercise training prevented exercise-mediated improvements in whole-body glucose tolerance. ALA consumption did not influence exercise-induced adaptations within skeletal muscle,  sensitivity and mitochondrial bioenergetics. In contrast, within eWAT, ALA supplementation attenuated  signalling, decreased mitochondrial respiration and increased the fraction of electron leak to reactive oxygen species (ROS).These findings indicate that, in an obese rodent model, consumption of ALA attenuates the favourable adaptive changes of exercise training within eWAT, which consequently impacts whole-body glucose homeostasis.

Physiologically, cells implement oleic alternative of fatty acids metabolism, oxidizing mainly ω-9 endogenous oleic mono-unsaturated fatty . The pathology of low density lipoproteins is primary deficiency of poly-unsaturated fatty acids in cells, atherosclerosis and atheromotosis of intima of arteries of elastic type with development of dense plaques from poly-unsaturated fatty acids in the form of polyethers of cholesterol.

Visceral adiposity is part of the metabolic syndrome, together with , dyslipidemia, hypertension and inflammation. Alleviation of metabolic syndrome requires normalization of  release and responses. This review assesses our current knowledge of the mechanisms that allow n-3 PUFAs to improve  secretion and sensitivity. EPA has been more extensively studied than either ALA or DHA. The complex actions of EPA include increased G-protein-receptor-mediated release of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) from enteroendocrine L-cells in the intestine, up-regulation of the apelin pathway and down-regulation of other control pathways to promote  secretion by the pancreatic β-cells, together with suppression of inflammatory responses to adipokines, inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α actions and prevention of decreased -like growth factor-1 secretion to improve peripheral  responses. The receptors involved and the mechanisms of action probably differ for ALA and DHA, with antiobesity effects predominating for ALA and anti-inflammatory effects for DHA. Modifying both GLP-1 release and the actions of adipokines by n-3 PUFAs could lead to additive improvements in both  secretion and sensitivity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Inflammation associated with IR is an interesting area of biomedical research in recent years and is expected to affect  signalling pathway via downregulating glucose transporters. In the present study, we evaluate the potential of punicic  (PA), a nutraceutical found in pomegranate seed oil, against TNF-α induced alteration in 3T3-L1 adipocytes on glucose metabolism, endocrine function and inflammation. IR was induced in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by treating with TNF-α (10 ng/mL) and various concentrations of PA (5, 10, 30 μM) were incubated simultaneously. After 24 h, we found that TNF-α treatment increased mRNA expression of SOCS3, PTP1B and a decrease in IRS1 causing diminished glucose uptake. Further, it showed significantly increased transcriptional activity of NFκB and leptin secretion while PA maintained leptin levels normal. Additionally, PA prevented the over-expression of phosphorylated JNK in a dose dependent manner during IR. PA also ameliorated significantly the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. From the results, we conclude that PA is effective to ameliorate TNF-α induced IR and also we recommend the intake of PA for control and management of IR and its associated complications.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

In the present study, the effects of a hypoenergetic diet rich in ALA (3·4 g/d) on the biomarkers of systemic inflammation and vascular function were investigated in eighty-one overweight-to-obese patients with metabolic syndrome traits in comparison with a hypoenergetic diet low in ALA (0·9 g/d, control). After a 6-month dietary intervention, there were significant decreases in the serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), TNF-α, IL-6, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble endothelial selectin (sE-selectin) and asymmetric dimethylarginine in both dietary groups. However, no inter-group differences were observed for all these changes.

In central Europe, momordica requires greenhouse plantations. Mature fruits resemble a cucumber or a pumpkin and can be used as other similar vegetables. Crude fruits are very bitter and refreshing. For centuries the plant has been known in Chinese traditional medicine for its antidiabetic effects as well as for the treatment of cancer or infections caused by worms, viruses and malaria. Antidiabetic effects are attributed namely to cucurbitane type triterpenoids, charantin, p- and 9cis-11trans-13trans-conjugated . These substances in momordica preparations show antidiabetic effectiveness in clinical studies by increasing  secretion and deceasing  or glucose absorption from the gut. Beside this main effect the extract possesses certain neuroprotective and antioxidant effects (especially p9cis-11trans-13trans-conjugated ) and contributes to normalize blood lipid and adipokine levels which results in the normalization of metabolic syndrome. Antidiabetic effectiveness of momordica was compared to active treatment with several oral antidiabetic drugs and proved comparable effects.

Dogs appear to be similar to other species with the exception of adiponectin, which might not be affected by obesity status. Serum long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  concentrations have been positively and negatively associated with serum adipokines. The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between leptin, CRP, adiponectin, and  to body condition score (BCS) and to the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in serum lipoproteins, including , eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentanenoic  (DPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) as a reflection of dietary omega-3 status in the Labrador Retriever. Seventy-seven Labrador Retrievers were evaluated for BCS, percent fasting serum lipoprotein fatty  concentrations, as well as serum leptin, adiponectin, , and CRP. A multivariable general linear regression model was constructed to examine the association between the dependent variables leptin, CRP, adiponectin, and  and the predictor variables of BCS, age, and sex, as well as concentrations of , EPA, DHA, and DPA. Adiponectin concentration was positively associated with age (<0.0008), EPA (=0.027) and negatively associated with DHA (=0.008). Leptin concentration was positively associated with an increased DHA (=0.009), BCS (<0.0001), age (=0.02), and decreased DPA (=0.06).  concentration was only associated with BCS (<0.0001), and no meaningful associations were found for CRP. Longer chain omega-3 fatty acids may play a role in regulating adiponectin concentrations in dogs. However, because  concentrations were associated only with BCSs, further examination of the role of adiponectin in canine obesity is warranted. EPA and DPA may reduce the overall inflammatory state in dogs as these omega-3 fatty acids reflect increased adiponectin (increased EPA and decreased DHA) and decreased leptin (decreased DHA and increased DPA).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24120122>Dietary Salba (Salvia hispanica L) seed rich in α- improves adipose tissue dysfunction and the altered skeletal muscle glucose and lipid metabolism in dyslipidemic -resistant rats.</a></h1><p>This work reports the effect of dietary Salba (chia) seed rich in n-3 α- on the morphological and metabolic aspects involved in adipose tissue dysfunction and the mechanisms underlying the impaired glucose and lipid metabolism in the skeletal muscle of rats fed a sucrose-rich diet (SRD).

In the current study, obese Zucker rats displayed decreased phospholipid (PL) content in association with hepatic lipid abundance, and therefore, we examined whether ALA and exercise training would prevent these abnormalities differently to reveal additive effects on the liver. To achieve this aim, obese Zucker rats were fed control diet alone or supplemented with ALA and were sedentary or exercise trained for 4 wk (C-Sed, ALA-Sed, C-Ex, and ALA-Ex). ALA-Sed rats had increased microsomal-triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP), a protein required for lipoprotein assembly/secretion, as well as modestly increased PL content in the absence of improvements in mitochondrial content, lipid accumulation, or  sensitivity. In contrast, C-Ex rats had increased mitochondrial content and  sensitivity; however, this corresponded with minimal improvements in PL content and hepatic lipid accumulation. Importantly, ALA-Ex rats demonstrated additive improvements in PL content and hepatic steatosis, which corresponded with increased mitochondrial content, MTTP and apolipoprotein B100 content, greater serum triacylglyceride, and  sensitivity. Overall, these data demonstrate additive effects of ALA and exercise training on hepatic lipid accumulation, as exercise training preferentially increased mitochondrial content, while ALA promoted an environment conducive for lipid secretion. These data highlight the potential for combination therapy to mitigate liver disease progression.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25940430>Toona Sinensis ameliorates  via AMPK and PPARγ pathways.</a></h1><p>Toona Sinensis leaf (TSL) extract with a beneficial effect for managing hyperglycemia has been reported, however the underlying mechanism by which TSL extract acts as an  sensitizer remains uncertain, especially in peripheral tissues. TSL 95% ethanol extract exhibited the highest transactivity of PPARγ and contained the highest amounts of natural PPARγ ligands including palmitic , linoleic , and α- among different TSL ethanol extracts (0, 10, 50, 70, and 95%). The efficacy and the mechanism of TSL ethanol extract (95%) mediated anti-diabetic effects were examined by both in vivo and in vitro models in this study. An improved whole-body  sensitivity was observed in high-fat diet-fed (HFD) mice after 14 weeks of TSL treatment, as evidenced by a faster rate of plasma glucose clearing. The improved  sensitivity was through direct stimulation of PPARγ and adiponectin expression in adipose tissues of HFD mice. In addition to the PPARγ pathway, TSL stimulated glucose uptake via directly inducing AMPKα but not AS160 activation in C2C12 myotubes under palmitate-induced . TSL successfully induced sirtuin 1 and restored PGC1α, but failed to restore mitochondrial electron transport complexes I, III, IV and V in mRNA levels. Loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential coupled with AMPK activation suggests that TSL acts as a mitochondrial inhibitor to stimulate AMPK-mediated glucose uptake. This study demonstrated that TSL stimulated glucose uptake via AMPK activation in skeletal muscles and promoted PPARγ and normalized adiponectin expression in adipose tissues, thereby ameliorating .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25371981>Isomeric C12-alkamides from the roots of Echinacea purpurea improve basal and -dependent glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.</a></h1><p>Echinacea purpurea has been used in traditional medicine as a remedy for the treatment and prevention of upper respiratory tract infections and the common cold. Recent investigations have indicated that E. purpurea also has an effect on . A dichloromethane extract of E. purpurea roots was found to enhance glucose uptake in adipocytes and to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. The purpose of the present study was to identify the bioactive compounds responsible for the potential antidiabetic effect of the dichloromethane extract using a bioassay-guided fractionation approach. Basal and -dependent glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used to assess the bioactivity of extract, fractions and isolated metabolites. A peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ transactivation assay was used to determine the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ activating properties of the extract, active fractions and isolated metabolites. Two novel isomeric dodeca-2E,4E,8Z,10E/Z-tetraenoic  2-methylbutylamides together with two known C12-alkamides and α- were isolated from the active fractions. The isomeric C12-alkamides were found to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, to increase basal and -dependent glucose uptake in adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner, and to exhibit characteristics of a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ partial agonist.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21519759>[Similarities, differences and agonisms of pleiotropic effects of statins and omega-3 fatty acids].</a></h1><p>This paper compares the pleiotropic effects of statins and omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) in treating and preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and deals with the possible interactions of those compounds. Statins represent one of the most important discoveries to have been made in the field of cardiovascular medicine in recent decades. Their beneficial cardiovascular effects, which have reduced the number of fatal events in patients with atherosclerosis, encompass more than their ability to lower cholesterol levels. The pleiotropic effects of statins involve their anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet properties and their ability to normalize endothelial function. In addition, these drugs may display antiarrhythmic activity, improve  sensitivity and counteract hypertension and obesity. The low rate of coronary disease documented in Eskimos corroborates the cardioprotective effects of the n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acids beyond their hypolipemic effects. The reduction of CVD-related deaths attributable to the action of α- fatty  appears to be related to its strong antiarrhythmic properties. In addition, as a precursor of EPA and this last fatty  of thromboxane A3, prostacyclin I3, serie-3 prostaglandines and serie 5-leukotrines and inhibitor/modulator of thromboxane A2, prostacyclin I2, serie-2 prostaglandines and serie 4-leukotrienes formation, the α- may reduce inflammation and thrombogenesis. As results of some studies suggest that the combined use of statins and n-3 PUFA improves cardiovascular protection and reduces the CVD-related mortality rate; the paper also reviews the possible synergism between both groups of compounds on CVD treatment and concludes that clear benefits may be obtained.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27344992>A panel of free fatty  ratios to predict the development of metabolic abnormalities in healthy obese individuals.</a></h1><p>Increasing evidences support that metabolically healthy obese (MHO) is a transient state. However, little is known about the early markers associated with the development of metabolic abnormalities in MHO individuals. Serum free fatty acids (FFAs) profile is highlighted in its association with obesity-related , type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). To examine the association of endogenous fatty  metabolism with future development of metabolic abnormalities in MHO individuals, we retrospectively analyzed 24 [product FFA]/[precursor FFA] ratios in fasting sera and clinical data from 481 individuals who participated in three independent studies, including 131 metabolic healthy subjects who completed the 10-year longitudinal Shanghai Diabetes Study (SHDS), 312 subjects cross-sectionally sampled from the Shanghai Obesity Study (SHOS), and 38 subjects who completed an 8-week very low carbohydrate diet (VLCD) intervention study. Results showed that higher baseline level of oleic /stearic  (OA/SA), and lower levels of stearic /palmitic  (SA/PA) and arachidonic /dihomo-γ- (AA/DGLA) ratios were associated with higher rate of MHO to MUO conversion in the longitudinal SHDS. Further, the finding was validated in the cross-sectional and interventional studies. This panel of FFA ratios could be used for identification and early intervention of at-risk obese individuals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30429440>Role of Borage Seed Oil and Fish Oil with or without Turmeric and Alpha- Tocopherol in Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and Fatty Liver in Rats.</a></h1><p>The aim of the present research was to Study the prevention of dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, inflammation and fatty liver as risk factors for cardiovascular disease via intervention by borage oil (B) and fish oil (F) with or without turmeric (T) and alpha-tocopherols (TC). Fatty acids were assessed in both oils while curcuminoids were determined in turmeric. Rats were divided into; first group fed on balanced diet and designated as normal control (NC), second fed on dyslipidemic and steatohepatitis (DS) inducer diet which represented the DS control group and groups 3-6 fed on DS inducer diet with daily oral administration of B, B+T+TC, F and F+T+TC; respectively for 5 weeks. Liver fat and plasma lipid profile, oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarker and liver and heart histopathology were assessed. Results showed gamma  to be 21.01% in B. F contained eicosapentaenoic as 22.768% and docosahexaenoic  as 13.574%.Total curcuminoids were 4.63 mg/g turmeric. The DS control group showed significant dyslipidemia, elevated malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha and liver fat with significant reduction in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) compared to NC. The different treatments produced significant improvement in all the parameters and histopathology. F was superior to B in ameliorating liver histopathological changes while B was more efficient in elevating TAC. B was more promising in improving lipid profile and liver fat compared to B + T + TC, while the latter was superior in improving MDA and liver histopathology. Fish oil was more efficient than F+TC+T except for TAC and high density lipoprotein cholesterol which were more improved on addition of TC and T.

The FXS and FXO groups received equivalent amounts of  (ALA; 7.4 g/day).The primary outcome measures were fasting plasma hemoglobin A(1c), glucose, , and phospholipid fatty  composition. The secondary outcome measures were fasting circulating leptin and adiponectin, as well as body weight, body mass index, and waist circumference. Dietary intake assessment and calculations for homeostasis model assessment for  and quantified  sensitivity check were also completed.The FXS and FXO groups had increases in plasma phospholipid n-3 fatty acids (ALA, eicosapentaenoic  [EPA], or decosapentaenoic  [DPA], but not docosahexaenoic ), and the FXO group had more EPA and DPA in plasma phospholipids compared to the FXS group. All groups had similar caloric intakes; however, the CTL group experienced a 4% weight gain compared to baseline (p < 0.05), while both flax groups had constant body weights during the study period. All other parameters, including glycemic control, were unchanged by dietary treatment.Milled FXS and FXO intake does not affect glycemic control in adults with well-controlled type 2 diabetes.

Previous studies of pregnant rats fed low-protein diets have suggested that the vegetable oils used in the experimental diets influence the outcome. The present study investigated the offspring of female rats fed semi-synthetic diets containing either 180 or 90g casein/kg with 70 g/kg (w/w) of either corn oil or soya oil during gestation. During lactation, the dams received stock diet, and the offspring were subsequently weaned onto the stock diet. The offspring of dams fed the low-protein diets were smaller at birth. At 25 weeks of age, the offspring were subjected to an oral glucose tolerance test. In the offspring of dams fed the diet containing soya oil, the area under the  curve was affected by the protein content of the maternal diet. There was no effect of protein on the area under the  curve in the offspring of dams fed the diet prepared with corn oil. There were no differences in plasma glucose concentrations. The levels of mRNA for acetyl-CoA carboxylase- in the livers of female offspring were affected by the protein and oil content of the maternal diet. The level of carnitine palmitoyl transferase mRNA was affected by the protein content of the maternal diet. The present study suggests that PUFA in the maternal diet can interact with protein metabolism to influence the development of the offspring. This may involve the higher content of  in soya oil compared with corn oil.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21062475>A defect in Δ6 and Δ5 desaturases may be a factor in the initiation and progression of , the metabolic syndrome and ischemic heart disease in South Asians.</a></h1><p>The high incidence of  and the metabolic syndrome in South Asians remains unexplained. I propose that a defect in the activity of Δ⁶ and Δ⁵ desaturases and consequent low plasma and tissue concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as γ- (GLA), dihomo-γ- (DGLA), arachidonic  (AA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and formation of their anti-inflammatory products prostaglandin E₁ (PGE₁), prostacyclin (PGI₂), PGI₃, lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, maresins and nitrolipids could be responsible for the high incidence of , the metabolic syndrome and ischemic heart disease (IHD) in South Asians. This proposal is supported by the observation that South Asian Indians have lower plasma and tissue concentrations of GLA, DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA, the precursors of PGE₁, PGI₂, PGI₃, lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and nitrolipids, the endogenous molecules that prevent platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction, thrombus formation, leukocyte activation and possess anti-inflammatory action and thus, are capable of preventing the development of , atherosclerosis, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and premature ischemic heart disease. Genetic predisposition, high carbohydrate intake, lack of exercise, tobacco use and low birth weight due to maternal malnutrition suppress the activity of Δ⁶ and Δ⁵ desaturases that leads to low plasma and tissue concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids and their products. This implies that adequate provision of polyunsaturated fatty acids and co-factors needed for their metabolism, and efforts to enhance the formation of their beneficial metabolites PGE₁, PGI₂, PGI₃, lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, maresins and nitrolipids could form a novel approach in the prevention and management of these diseases in this high-risk population.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20228612>Polyunsaturated fatty  levels of serum and red blood cells in apparently healthy Japanese subjects living in an urban area.</a></h1><p>We assessed levels of polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) in serum and red blood cells (RBCs) among groups stratified by generation and its clinical significance in Japanese subjects living in an urban area.We enrolled 200 apparently healthy Japanese (126 males, mean age: 50.3+/-9.2 years) living in an urban area. Levels of PUFA, including eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), arachidonic  (AA), and dihomo-gamma- (DGLA) in serum and RBCs were measured for each generation (G1 <35y, G2 35y-<45y, G3 45y-<55y, G4 55y-<65y, G5>or=65y).No significant differences in EPA, DHA, AA, or EPA/AA were observed between males and females.

Studies have shown that consumption of DAG results in metabolic characteristics that are distinct from those of TAG, which may be beneficial in preventing and managing obesity. The objective of the present study was to investigate if food items in which part of the TAG oil is replaced with DAG oil combined with high α- (ALA) content would influence metabolic markers. A 12-week double-blinded randomised controlled parallel-design study was conducted. The participants (n 23) were healthy, overweight men and women, aged 37-67 years, BMI 27-35 kg/m(2), with waist circumference >94 cm (men) and >88 cm (women). The two groups received 20 g margarine, 11 g mayonnaise and 12 g oil per d, containing either high ALA and sn-1,3-DAG or high ALA and TAG. Substitution of TAG oil with DAG oil in food items for 12 weeks led to an improvement of the predicted 10 years cardiovascular risk score in overweight subjects by non-significantly improving markers of health such as total body fat percentage, trunk fat mass, alanine aminotransferase, systolic blood pressure, γ-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase and total fat-free mass.

The HFHC-SFA caused a significant increase in serum HDL cholesterol and phospholipids as well as elevated levels of oxidized HDL and oxidized LDL. Replacing SFA with PUFA significantly reduced the levels of these oxidized lipoproteins and enhanced the ability of HDL to protect LDL from oxidation. The SFA-mediated impairment of HDL antioxidant potential was not associated with the cholesterol content of the diet, obesity or . In contrast, the effect of the HFHC diets on fecal macrophage-derived cholesterol excretion was independent of the fatty  source.SFA intake impairs the antioxidant potential of HDL and increases serum levels of oxidized lipoprotein species whereas the antioxidant potential of HDL is enhanced after PUFA consumption.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Funnel plots were examined and subgrouping assessed effects of intervention type, replacement, baseline risk of diabetes and use of antidiabetes drugs, trial duration, and dose. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool and quality of evidence with GRADE.83 randomised controlled trials (mainly assessing effects of supplementary long chain omega-3) were included; 10 were at low summary risk of bias. Long chain omega-3 had little or no effect on likelihood of diagnosis of diabetes (relative risk 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.17; 58 643 participants, 3.7% developed diabetes) or measures of glucose metabolism (HbA mean difference -0.02%, 95% confidence interval -0.07% to 0.04%; plasma glucose 0.04, 0.02 to 0.07, mmol/L; fasting  1.02, -4.34 to 6.37, pmol/L; HOMA-IR 0.06, -0.21 to 0.33). A suggestion of negative outcomes was observed when dose of supplemental long chain omega-3 was above 4.4 g/d. Effects of α-, omega-6, and total PUFA on diagnosis of diabetes were unclear (as the evidence was of very low quality), but little or no effect on measures of glucose metabolism was seen, except that increasing α- may increase fasting  (by about 7%). No evidence was found that the omega-3/omega-6 ratio is important for diabetes or glucose metabolism.This is the most extensive systematic review of trials to date to assess effects of polyunsaturated fats on newly diagnosed diabetes and glucose metabolism, including previously unpublished data following contact with authors. Evidence suggests that increasing omega-3, omega-6, or total PUFA has little or no effect on prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.PROSPERO CRD42017064110.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Rich in unsaturated fats, especially linoleic , soybean oil is assumed to be healthy, and yet it induces obesity, diabetes, , and fatty liver in mice. Here, we show that the genetically modified soybean oil Plenish, which came on the U.S. market in 2014 and is low in linoleic , induces less obesity than conventional soybean oil in C57BL/6 male mice. Proteomic analysis of the liver reveals global differences in hepatic proteins when comparing diets rich in the two soybean oils, coconut oil, and a low-fat diet. Metabolomic analysis of the liver and plasma shows a positive correlation between obesity and hepatic C18 oxylipin metabolites of omega-6 (ω6) and omega-3 (ω3) fatty acids (linoleic and α-, respectively) in the cytochrome P450/soluble epoxide hydrolase pathway. While Plenish induced less  than conventional soybean oil, it resulted in hepatomegaly and liver dysfunction as did olive oil, which has a similar fatty  composition. These results implicate a new class of compounds in diet-induced obesity-C18 epoxide and diol oxylipins.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24286221>Loss of NDG-4 extends lifespan and stress  in Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h1><p>NDG-4 is a predicted transmembrane acyltransferase protein that acts in the distribution of lipophilic factors. Consequently, ndg-4 mutants lay eggs with a pale appearance due to lack of yolk, and they are resistant to sterility caused by dietary supplementation with the long-chain omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty  dihommogamma- (DGLA). Two other proteins, NRF-5 and NRF-6, a homolog of a mammalian secreted lipid binding protein and a NDG-4 homolog, respectively, have previously been shown to function in the same lipid transport pathway. Here, we report that mutation of the NDG-4 protein results in increased organismal stress  and lifespan. When NDG-4 function and /IGF-1 signaling are reduced simultaneously, maximum lifespan is increased almost fivefold. Thus, longevity conferred by mutation of ndg-4 is partially overlapping with  signaling. The nuclear hormone receptor NHR-80 (HNF4 homolog) is required for longevity in germline less animals. We find that NHR-80 is also required for longevity of ndg-4 mutants. Moreover, we find that nrf-5 and nrf-6 mutants also have extended lifespan and increased stress , suggesting that altered lipid transport and metabolism play key roles in determining lifespan.© 2013 The Authors.

The aim of the study was to examine the associations of adipose tissue PUFA biomarkers with MetS among parents and children in Mesoamerica.We conducted a cross-sectional study among 468 parents and 201 children aged 7-12 y from the capital cities of Guatemala, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Costa Rica, and Belize, and Tuxtla Gutiérrez in Mexico. We measured PUFA biomarkers in gluteal adipose tissue by gas chromatography. In adults, MetS was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III definition. In children, we created an age- and sex-standardized metabolic risk score using abdominal circumference, the homeostasis model of , blood pressure, serum HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. We estimated prevalence ratios of MetS and mean differences in metabolic score across quartiles of PUFA using multivariable-adjusted Poisson and linear regression models, respectively. Among adults, MetS was associated with low  (ALA), high eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and low gamma- (GLA). It was linearly, positively associated with dihomo-gamma- (DGLA) and estimated Δ6-desaturase (D6D) activity. Among children, the metabolic score was positively associated with docosapentaenoic  (DPA), DGLA, and D6D activity.Among Mesoamerican adults, MetS prevalence is inversely associated with adipose tissue ALA and GLA, and positively associated with EPA, DGLA, and the D6D index. Among children, metabolic risk score is positively associated with DPA, DGLA, and the D6D index.Copyright © 2018 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

However, the relationship between  and fatty  composition in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues remains to be clarified. In the present study, we extracted the triacylglycerol from visceral (epididymis and mesentery) and subcutaneous adipose tissues in normal and -resistant, high-fat-fed (HFF) rats and determined the composition of each fatty . The concentrations of palmitoleic, docosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic, dihomo-γ-, arachidonic, and docosatetraenoic acids were higher in epididymal adipose tissue than in mesenteric and subcutaneous adipose tissues; but no significant differences were detected between mesenteric and subcutaneous tissues in the normal group or among all the sites in the HFF rats. In the HFF group, stearic and oleic  concentrations were higher, whereas n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated ones were lower, than those in the normal group. Palmitoleic  and some n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty  compositions in adipose tissue triacylglycerol depend on anatomical location, which may affect the properties and/or function of adipose tissues. These results at least in part suggest that the properties of adipose tissue are difficult to distinguish based only on their "visceral" or "subcutaneous" sites. In addition, the absence of site dependence and/or difference in balance among saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids may play an important role in the development of  in the HFF rats.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Clinical characteristics, the fatty  composition of plasma cholesteryl esters, and energy and nutrient intakes were analyzed in 3 groups: metabolic syndrome (MS, n=24), abdominal obesity (OB, n=43), and control (n=27). The estimated desaturase activities were calculated by the ratio of 16:1n-7/16:0, 18:3n-6/18:2n-6, and 20:4n-6/20:3n-6 in plasma cholesteryl esters as surrogates of the measure of the delta 9, delta 6, delta 5 desaturase (D9-16D, D6D and D5D) activities, respectively. Plasma fatty  composition did not differ significantly between the OB group and the control group. The MS group had higher levels of palmitoleic, oleic, and gamma- acids, but a lower level of linoleic  than the control. Stronger D6D activity and weaker D5D activity were observed in the OB group. A higher level of D9-16D activity as well as a higher level of D6D activity and a lower level of D5D activity was observed in the MS group. A logistic regression analysis showed that the low D5D activity and high D9-16D activity were predictive of the development of abdominal obesity from controls (odds ratio=0.39, p<0.05) and metabolic syndrome from abdominal obesity (odds ratio=2.44, p<0.05), respectively. In the multiple linear regression analysis, D5D activity positively correlated with the intake of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). In conclusion, the estimated D5D activity was a predictive factor for abdominal obesity and the estimated D9-16D activity was a predictive factor for developing metabolic syndrome from abdominal obesity in Japanese male subjects. Dietary intake of EPA would play an important role in preventing abdominal obesity and the development of metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23313466>Reply to manuscript IJC-D-12-04197 entitled "Does alpha-lipoic  treatment play a role on oxidative stress and  in overweight/obese patients?" by MD Turgay Ulas.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20041810>The role of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the treatment of dyslipidemias.</a></h1><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are a family of lipids including some subgroups identified by the position of the last double bond in their structure. PUFA n-3 include  (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), while PUFA n-6 include linoleic  (LA) and arachidonic  (AA). Since PUFA n-3 consumption has been shown to be inversely correlated with coronary heart diseases (CHD) incidence, clinical trials have been principally conducted by administering fish oil supplements or purified PUFA n-3. The relationship between dietary PUFA n-3 and CHD is believed to be only partially mediated by their effects on plasma lipoprotein profile. PUFA n-3 have shown to reduce only slightly total and LDL cholesterol, probably as they crowd saturated fatty acids out of diet. Data on HDL cholesterol suggest that PUFA n-3 produce only a small increase in this fraction. The effect of PUFA n-3 supplementation on plasma triglycerides (TG) is much more important, with a reduction of about 25% in normolipidemic subjects and about 50% in hypertriglyceridemic patients. This effect seems to be mediated by an inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase, and VLDL secretion, and an increase in apo B liver degradation. They also increase lipoprotein lipase activity resulting in a reduction of post-prandial TG. PUFA n-3 might be used as second line therapy, additional or alternative to fibrates and nicotinic , in the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia. Furthermore, the addition of PUFA n-3 to statin therapy might contribute to normalize TG levels in patients with combined hyperlipidemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26155043>The Riddle of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Progression From Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver to Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) is an emerging global epidemic which progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis in a subset of subjects.

We compared fasting serum free fatty  (FFA) composition between EH patients and nonhypertensive (NH) subjects, and examined the relationships between fasting serum FFA composition and waist/hip ratio,  activity, blood pressure, serum zinc, age, and sex in both groups. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 232 community-dwelling subjects aged between 35 and 60 years: 109 EH patients and 123 NH subjects. Serum FFA was determined by HPLC analysis. The data were analyzed by multivariate linear stepwise regression, stratified analysis, and correlation analysis. In men, EH patients had lower C22:6/C20:5 ratios (n-3 Delta6-desaturase activity index, 7.96+/-8.81 vs. 14.5+/-13.1, p<0.01), polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), n-3 PUFA and polyunsaturated/saturated (P/S) ratios compared with male subjects without hypertension. There were no differences in women. Fasting serum FFA composition was significantly related to many variables, including waist/hip ratio,  sensitivity index, and serum zinc (all p<0.05 or <0.01) for all the subjects, and included both age- and sex-related differences (both p<0.05). Compared with NH, EH patients had lower levels of serum zinc (14.9+/-5.00 micromol L(-1) vs. 16.8+/-6.38 micromol L(-1), p<0.05). We concluded that EH patients had marked alteration in fasting serum FFA composition, which was affected by upper body obesity, , zinc deficiency, and high dietary fat, and that the differences were age- and sex-related.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21440024>Pomegranate seed oil, a rich source of punicic , prevents diet-induced obesity and  in mice.</a></h1><p>Pomegranate seed oil has been shown to protect against diet induced obesity and .To characterize the metabolic effects of punicic  on high fat diet induced obesity and .High-fat diet or high-fat diet with 1% Pomegranate seed oil (PUA) was fed for 12 weeks to induce obesity and .

Twenty participants received three diets for 4 weeks each: SFA-rich diet, Mediterranean (Med) diet enriched in MUFA with virgin olive oil, and a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet enriched in n-3 PUFA (α- from plant origin) (CHO-PUFA diet). After 12 h of fasting, volunteers received a breakfast reflecting the fatty  composition of the diet ingested in the preceding dietary period. Med diet induced higher postprandial SOD2 and TrxR mRNA levels, and CHO-PUFA diet induced higher GPx1 and TrxR mRNA levels compared with SFA-rich diet. Med and CHO-PUFA breakfasts induced a postprandial increase in plasma reduced glutathione (GSH), and a greater postprandial GSH/oxidized glutathione ratio compared to the SFA-rich diet. Our study suggests that the consumption of Med and CHO-PUFA diets may reduce postprandial oxidative stress compared to an SFA-rich diet, which may be due to higher antioxidant enzymes gene expression in adipose tissue.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18492301>Dietary chia seed (Salvia hispanica L.) rich in  improves adiposity and normalises hypertriacylglycerolaemia and  in dyslipaemic rats.</a></h1><p>The present study investigates the benefits of the dietary intake of chia seed (Salvia hispanica L.) rich in  and fibre upon dyslipidaemia and  (IR), induced by intake of a sucrose-rich (62.5 %) diet (SRD).

An altered fatty  composition has been associated with MetS, but the Mediterranean diet has been shown to have a protective effect. The aim of the present study was to analyze the influence of a Mediterranean dietary pattern, as assessed by the biomarkers of food supplied, on the plasma fatty  composition and its relation with MetS after 1 year of intervention.A total of 424 subjects were randomly selected from the PREDIMED randomized dietary trial after completing a 1-year intervention program. Participants aged 55 to 80 years and at high risk of cardiovascular disease were randomly assigned to three dietary interventions: Mediterranean diet supplemented with virgin olive oil or nuts, or a low-fat diet.After 1 year of intervention participants in the virgin olive oil group showed significantly increased plasma concentrations of palmitic and oleic acids, but reduced proportions of margaric, stearic, and linoleic acids. In turn, subjects in the nut group showed significantly increased levels of palmitic, linoleic, and α- acids, but reduced proportions of myristic, margaric, palmitoleic, and dihommo-γ-linoleic acids. Increases in the biomarkers of foods supplied to the Mediterranean diet groups, i.e., oleic and α- acids, were beneficially associated with the incidence, reversion and prevalence of MetS. No weight changes were observed among participants.The nut and olive oil diets induced a fatty  composition that has been shown to be beneficial in the face of MetS. Therefore, a Mediterranean diet rich in fats of vegetable origin may be a useful tool for the management of MetS without the need for concerns over weight gain due to its high fat content.Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN35739639.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30397878>The Changes of Serum Metabolites in Diabetic GK Rats after Ileal Transposition Surgery.</a></h1><p>Ileal transposition (IT) surgery could improve metabolism.

Immune cell infiltration into adipose tissue is thought to contribute to the metabolic complications of obesity, with local and systemic consequences for the inflammatory status of the obese individual. Dietary interventions with omega-3 fatty acids from marine sources have been successful at reducing inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine whether flaxseed oil containing the plant-based omega-3 fatty  α- (ALA) is an effective modulator of inflammation and adipocyte dysfunction.Seventeen-week old male fa/fa and lean Zucker rats were fed a control diet (faCTL, lnCTL) and fa/fa rats were fed an ALA-rich flaxseed oil supplemented diet (faFLAX) for 8 weeks. Adipose tissue and serum were collected and analyzed for cytokine (IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α), haptoglobin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and adipokine (leptin, adiponectin) levels. Splenocytes were isolated and ex vivo mitogen-stimulated cytokine production was measured. Digital images of adipose tissue sections were used to quantify adipocyte area. Macrophage and T-cell infiltration were assessed in adipose tissue by immunohistochemistry.faFLAX rats had 17% smaller adipocytes and 5-fold lower MCP-1 levels in adipose tissue than faCTL rats. Adipose tissue levels of IL-10 were 72% lower in the faFLAX group compared to baseline, and TNF-α levels decreased 80% (equal to lnCTL levels) in the faFLAX group compared to faCTL. There were no changes in ex vivo cytokine production by splenocytes between faFLAX and faCTL. Macrophage infiltration was not different among groups; however, faFLAX rats had less T-cell infiltration than faCTL rats.Dietary intervention with ALA-rich flaxseed oil in obese Zucker rats reduced adipocyte hypertrophy, protein levels of inflammatory markers MCP-1 and TNF-α, and T-cell infiltration in adipose tissue. Modest improvements to other parameters of obesity were also observed. The results suggest that, due to its ability to improve adipocyte function, ALA-rich flaxseed oil confers health benefits in obesity.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, ALA reduced hepatic steatosis and modified the standard fat concentration in the liver of animals fed an HFD. Dietary ALA supplementation reduced the serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), increased the expression of important chaperones such as binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and reduced the expression of C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) in hepatic tissues, suggesting an ERS adaptation in response to ALA supplementation.Dietary ALA supplementation is effective in preventing hepatic steatosis; is associated with a reduction in , inflammation and ERS; and represents an alternative for improving liver function and obtaining metabolic benefits.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19069444>[The composition of nonesterified fatty acids in patients with metabolic syndrome].</a></h1><p>The blood composition of non-etherized fatty acids (NEFA) was studied in 22 patients with metabolic syndrome (MS) and 11 healthy individuals. The qualitative NEFA composition presented by 31 components of individual fatty acids was analyzed, by taking into account of glucose- homeostatic changes in MS patients: those without  (IR) (Group 1) and those with diagnosed IR (Group 2). MS patients with normal insulinemia were ascertained to have lower levels of lauric, myristic, palmitic, C24:0, C16:0i acids. With a decrease in the relative quantity of saturated NEFA, the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (FA) increased. The proportions of linoleic (C18:2 omega 6) and  (C18:3 omega 3) acids doubled (p < 0.01), arachidonic  (C20:4 omega 6) was observed to tend to rise. The cumulative FA index sigma omega 6 increased twofold. In Group 1, the integrated index of changes in the FA series (unsaturation index) was 41% higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05). In Group 2, the vector of changes in the relative quantity of NEFA was similar, but impairments were less marked than that in Group 1.

To examine this hypothesis, serum phospholipid FA, desaturase activities, fasting glycemic status, and cardiometabolic parameters were measured in study participants (n = 1022; 30-69 years; male, n = 527; female, n = 495; nondiabetics without disease) who were stratified into normal fasting glucose (NFG) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) groups. Total monounsaturated FA (MUFA), oleic  (OA; 18:1n-9), dihomo-γ- (DGLA; 20:3n-6), Δ-9-desaturase activity (D9D; 18:1n-9/18:0), and DGLA/linoleic  (20:3n-6/18:2n-6) in serum phospholipids were significantly higher in IFG subjects than NFG controls. Study subjects were subdivided into 4 groups, based on fasting glucose levels and MetS status. Palmitoleic  (16:1n-7) was highest in IFG-MetS and lowest in NFG-non-MetS subjects. Oleic  and D9D were higher in IFG-MetS than in the other 3 groups. Dihomo-γ- and DGLA/linoleic  were higher in MetS than in non-MetS, regardless of fasting glucose levels. The high-sensitivity C-reactive proteins (hs-CRPs) and 8-epi-prostaglandin-F2α were higher in IFG than in NFG, regardless of MetS status. Oxidized low-density lipoproteins were higher in IFG-MetS than in the other 3 groups. Total MUFAs, OA, and D9D were positively correlated with homeostasis model assessment of , fasting glucose, triglyceride, hs-CRP, and 8-epi-prostaglandin-F2α. Palmitoleic  was positively correlated with triglyceride and hs-CRP. Lastly, total MUFA, OA, palmitoleic , and D9D were associated with early alteration of fasting glycemic status, therefore suggesting that these may be useful markers for predicting the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic diseases.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to compare a safflower oil (SO)-enriched diet to EO- and fish oil (FO)-enriched diets on circulating and tissue PUFAs levels and glycemic, inflammatory, and cardiovascular health biomarkers in  resistant African green monkeys. In a Latin-square cross-over study, eight monkeys consumed matched diets for 6 weeks with 3-week washout periods. Monkeys consuming FO had significantly higher levels of n-3 LC-PUFAs and EO supplementation resulted in higher levels of circulating n-3 LC-PUFAs and a significant increase in dihomo-gamma  (DGLA) in red blood cells and muscle. Glucose disposal was improved after EO consumption. These data suggest that PUFAs in EO supplementation have the capacity to alter circulating, RBC and muscle LC-PUFA levels and improve glucose tolerance in -resistant monkeys.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Delta-5 desaturase (D5D) is an enzyme that metabolizes dihomo-γ- (DGLA) to arachidonic  (AA). Thus, D5D inhibition increases DGLA (precursor to anti-inflammatory eicosanoids) while decreasing AA (precursor to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids), and could result in synergistic improvement in the low-grade inflammatory state. Here, we demonstrate reduced  and the anti-obesity effect of a D5D selective inhibitor (compound-326), an orally active small-molecule, in a high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse model. In vivo D5D inhibition was confirmed by determining changes in blood AA/DGLA profiles. In DIO mice, chronic treatment with compound-326 lowered  and caused body weight loss without significant impact on cumulative calorie intake. Decreased macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue was expected from mRNA analysis. Increased daily energy expenditure was also observed following administration of compound-326, in line with sustained body weight loss. These data indicate that the novel D5D selective inhibitor, compound-326, will be a new class of drug for the treatment of obese and diabetic patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23084639>High levels of stearic , palmitoleic , and dihomo-γ- and low levels of linoleic  in serum cholesterol ester are associated with high .</a></h1><p>The association of fatty  composition with  and type 2 diabetes has been reported in Western populations, but there is limited evidence of this association among the Japanese, whose populace consume large amounts of fish. To test the hypothesis that high palmitic, palmitoleic, and dihomo-γ- acids and low levels of linoleic and n-3 fatty acids are associated with higher  among the Japanese, the authors investigated the relationship between serum fatty  composition and serum C-peptide concentrations in 437 Japanese employees aged 21 to 67 years who participated in a workplace health examination. Serum cholesterol ester and phospholipid fatty  compositions were measured by gas-liquid chromatography. Desaturase activity was estimated by fatty  product-to-precursor ratios. A multiple regression was used to assess the association between fatty  and C-peptide concentrations. C-peptide concentrations were associated inversely with linoleic  levels in cholesterol ester and phospholipid (P for trend = .01 and .02, respectively) and positively with stearic and palmitoleic acids in cholesterol ester (P for trend =.02 and .006, respectively) and dihomo-γ- in cholesterol ester and phospholipid (P for trend < .0001 for both). C-peptide concentrations were not associated with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. C-peptide concentrations significantly increased as δ-9-desaturase (16:1 n-7/16:0) and δ-6-desaturase (18:3 n-6/18:2 n-6) increased (P for trend = .01 and .03, respectively) and δ-5-desaturase (20:4 n-6/20:3 n-6) decreased (P for trend = .004). In conclusion, a fatty  pattern with high levels of serum stearic, palmitoleic, or dihomo-γ- acids; δ-9-desaturase (16:1 n-7/16:0) or δ-6-desaturase (18:3 n-6/18:2 n-6) activities; and low levels of serum linoleic  or δ-5-desaturase (20:4 n-6/20:3 n-6) activity might be associated with higher  in Japanese adults.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

IR was defined as the highest quartile of homeostasis model assessment, and nutrient intake was estimated from a diet history questionnaire. The odds ratios (ORs) of IR taking the lowest quartile of ALA or EPA+DHA intake as the reference were calculated by logistic regression analysis.Mean age, body mass index (BMI), and dietary ALA, and median of dietary EPA+DHA were 47.9 years, 22.9 kg/m(2), and 1.90 g/day (0.88%E) and 0.77 g/day (0.36%E), respectively. The ORs of IR decreased across the quartiles of ALA intake (multivariate-adjusted OR for Q4 versus Q1=0.74, P for trend=0.01) and the association was observed only in subjects with a BMI of <25 kg/m(2) (P for interaction=0.033).

Not all obese individuals, however, progress to heart failure. Indeed, obesity may provide protection from cardiovascular mortality in some populations. The fatty  milieu, modulated by diet, may modify obesity-induced myocardial structure and function, lending partial explanation for the array of cardiomyopathic phenotype in obese individuals.Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed 1 of the following 4 diets for 32 weeks: control (CON); 50% saturated fat (SAT); 40% saturated fat + 10% linoleic  (SAT+LA); 40% saturated fat + 10% α- (SAT+ALA). Serum leptin, , glucose, free fatty acids and triglycerides were quantitated. In vivo cardiovascular outcomes included blood pressure, heart rate and echocardiographic measurements of structure and function. The rats were sacrificed and myocardium was processed for fatty  analysis (TLC-GC), and evaluation of potential modifiers of myocardial structure including collagen (Masson's trichrome, hydroxyproline quantitation), lipid (Oil Red O, triglyceride quantitation) and myocyte cross sectional area.Rats fed SAT+LA and SAT+ALA diets had greater cranial LV wall thickness compared to rats fed CON and SAT diets, in the absence of hypertension or apparent . Treatment was not associated with changes in myocardial function. Myocardial collagen and triglycerides were similar among treatment groups; however, rats fed the high-fat diets, regardless of composition, demonstrated increased myocyte cross sectional area.Under conditions of high-fat feeding, replacement of 10% saturated fat with either LA or ALA is associated with thickening of the cranial LV wall, but without concomitant functional changes. Increased myocyte size appears to be a more likely contributor to early LV thickening in response to high-fat feeding. These findings suggest that myocyte hypertrophy may be an early change leading to gross LV hypertrophy in the hearts of "healthy" obese rats, in the absence of hypertension, diabetes and myocardial ischemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031387>Metabolic pathways of oleic and palmitic  are intensified in PCOS patients with normal androgen levels.</a></h1><p>The aetiology and pathogenesis polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) remain uncertain and thus the relative studies are still crucial.Our aim was to analyse the fatty acids profiles of the main phospholipids species in serum from women with PCOS classified into phenotypes, and to diagnose women more susceptible to the occurrence of inflammatory state.PCOS screening tests were performed in The Clinic of Gynecology and Urogynecology of Pomeranian Medical University in the 2014-2015 years.The study are designed for general community and a primary care or referral center.39 patients with PCOS, diagnosed according to Rotterdam's criteria, and 14 healthy women, as a control group, participated in this study.

However, some data suggest heterogeneity within the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) depot with potential metabolic differences between the superficial SAT (sSAT) and deep SAT (dSAT) compartments. We aimed to investigate the heterogeneity of these three depots with regard to fatty  (FA) composition and gene expression. Adipose tissue biopsies were collected from 75 obese women undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery. FA composition and gene expression were determined with gas chromatography and quantitative real-time-PCR, respectively. Stearoyl CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) activity was estimated by product-to-precursor FA ratios. All polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) with 20 carbons were consistently lower in VAT than either SAT depots, whereas essential PUFA (linoleic , 18:2n-6 and α-, 18:3n-3) were similar between all three depots. Lauric and palmitic  were higher and lower in VAT, respectively. The SCD-1 product palmitoleic  as well as estimated SCD-1 activity was higher in VAT than SAT. Overall, there was a distinct association pattern between lipid metabolizing genes and individual FAs in VAT. In conclusion, SAT and VAT are two distinct depots with regard to FA composition and expression of key lipogenic genes.

BA dysregulation plays an important role in the development of metabolic disease. However, BAs in relation to fatty acids have not been fully investigated in obesity-related metabolic disorders. A targeted metabolomic measurement of serum BA and free fatty  profiles was applied to sera of 381 individuals in 2 independent studies. The results showed that the ratio of dihomo-γ- (DGLA) to deoxycholic  (DCA) species (DCAS) was significantly increased in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) from a case-control study and decreased in the remission group of obese subjects with T2DM after metabolic surgery. The changes were closely associated with their metabolic status. These results were consistently confirmed in both serum and liver of mice with diet-induced obesity, implying that such a metabolic alteration in circulation reflects changes occurring in the liver.  studies of human liver L-02 cell lines under BA treatment revealed that DCA and its conjugated form, TDCA, significantly inhibited mRNA expression of fatty  transport protein 5 in the presence of DGLA, which was involved in hepatocyte DGLA uptake. Thus, the DGLA:DCAS ratio may be a promising biomarker for metabolic abnormalities in obesity.-Lei, S., Huang, F., Zhao, A., Chen, T., Chen, W., Xie, G., Zheng, X., Zhang, Y., Yu, H., Zhang, P., Rajani, C., Bao, Y., Jia, W., Jia, W.

Recent studies have focused on the extent to which obesity-induced  is mediated through oxylipins, derived from enzymatic and nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation. Vitamin E and vitamin C are widely used antioxidant supplements, but conflicting data exist as to whether supplementation with vitamins E and C reduces . The purpose of this work is (1) to test the hypothesis that supplementation with vitamin E and vitamin C prevents the development of  and (2) to determine the extent to which antioxidant supplementation modifies obesity-induced changes in hepatic oxylipins.

The obese phenotype was associated with increased hepatic concentrations of cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-dependent linoleic  and α--derived epoxides. Antioxidant supplementation, but not obesity, decreased levels of the lipoxygenase (LOX)-dependent, arachidonic -derived products lipoxin A4 (LXA4), 8,15-dihydroxtetraenoate (8,15-DiHETE), and 5,15-DiHETE.

During NAFLD pathogenesis, changes in blood and liver contents of different fatty  types also vary. Cytochrome P450 2A5 (CYP2A5), an important enzyme in mouse liver, metabolizes many drugs and activates multiple pro-carcinogens with widely varying structures. According to the changes in liver fatty  profiles observed in NAFLD animal models developed in our laboratory and others, saturated (PA/palmitic, and SA/stearic acids) and unsaturated (OA/oleic, LA/linoleic, ALA/α- and AA/arachidonic acids) fatty acids were selected to induce mouse primary hepatocytes, at concentrations under 1 mM, as detected by MTT assay. After 24 h treatment with various fatty  concentrations and types, CYP2A5 mRNA and protein amounts, and enzyme activity were determined by real-time PCR, Western blot, and Coumarin 7-hydroxylation, respectively. Meanwhile, Nrf2 mRNA and protein levels were evaluated by real-time PCR and Western blot. The results indicated that saturated fatty acids are more potent in inducing CYP2A5 than unsaturated ones, except arachidonic . In addition, the changes in CYP2A5 expression were consistent with the alterations observed in Nrf2 expression, indicating that Nrf2 might play a regulatory role in CYP2A5 expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28988484>Flaxseed Oil Alleviates Chronic HFD-Induced  through Remodeling Lipid Homeostasis in Obese Adipose Tissue.</a></h1><p>Emerging evidence suggests that higher circulating long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFA) levels were intimately associated with lower prevalence of obesity and .

Mice after HFD feeding for 16 weeks (60% fat-derived calories) exhibited systemic , which was greatly attenuated by medium dose of FO (M-FO), paralleling with differential accumulation of ALA and its n-3 derivatives across serum lipid fractions. Moreover, M-FO was sufficient to effectively block the metabolic activation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs), thereby improving adipose tissue  signaling.

The present study examines an individual's innate capacity to synthesise n-6 long-chain PUFA (LC-PUFA) with respect to the fatty  desaturase (FADS) locus in Americans of African and European descent with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. Compared with European Americans (EAm), African Americans (AfAm) exhibited markedly higher serum levels of arachidonic  (AA) (EAm 7·9 (sd 2·1), AfAm 9·8 (sd 1·9) % of total fatty acids; P < 2·29 × 10⁻⁹) and the AA:n-6-precursor fatty  ratio, which estimates FADS1 activity (EAm 5·4 (sd 2·2), AfAm 6·9 (sd 2·2); P = 1·44 × 10⁻⁵). In all, seven SNP mapping to the FADS locus revealed strong association with AA, EPA and dihomo-γ- (DGLA) in the EAm. Importantly, EAm homozygous for the minor allele (T) had significantly lower AA levels (TT 6·3 (sd 1·0); GG 8·5 (sd 2·1); P = 3·0 × 10⁻⁵) and AA:DGLA ratios (TT 3·4 (sd 0·8), GG 6·5 (sd 2·3); P = 2·2 × 10⁻⁷) but higher DGLA levels (TT 1·9 (sd 0·4), GG 1·4 (sd 0·4); P = 3·3 × 10⁻⁷) compared with those homozygous for the major allele (GG). Allele frequency patterns suggest that the GG genotype at rs174537 (associated with higher circulating levels of AA) is much higher in AfAm (0·81) compared with EAm (0·46). Similarly, marked differences in rs174537 genotypic frequencies were observed in HapMap populations. These data suggest that there are probably important differences in the capacity of different populations to synthesise LC-PUFA. These differences may provide a genetic mechanism contributing to health disparities between populations of African and European descent.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26743332>Effect of Increasing Doses of Linoleic and α- Acids on High-Fructose and High-Fat Diet Induced Metabolic Syndrome in Rats.</a></h1><p>Doses and ratio of linoleic  (LA) and α- (ALA) preventing metabolic syndrome (MS) were investigated.

In addition, children with high- grade liver steatosis exhibited higher proportions of palmitic  (C16:0), palmitoleic  (C16:1n-7), dihomo-γ- (C20:3n-6), adrenic  (C22:4n-6), and docosapentaenoic  (C22:5n-6); and lower proportions of eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5n-3) (P< 0.05). In all subjects, the NAFLD score was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) (r = 0.696), homeostasis model of assessment ratio-index (HOMA-IR) (r = 0.510), SCD1(16) (r = 0.273), and the delta-6 index (r = 0.494); and inversely associated with the delta-5 index (r = -0.443).Our current data suggested that children with liver steatosis was highly associated with obesity, and . In addition, increased endogenous lipogenesis through altered desaturase activity may contribute to the progression of liver steatosis in children.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29471812>Effect of weight loss on circulating fatty  profiles in overweight subjects with high visceral fat area: a 12-week randomized controlled trial.</a></h1><p>Significant associations between visceral fat and alterations in plasma fatty acids have been identified in overweight individuals. However, there are scant data regarding the relationships of the visceral fat area (VFA) with the plasma fatty  profiles and desaturase activities following weight loss. We investigated the effect of weight loss with mild calorie restriction on the circulating fatty  profiles and desaturase activities in nondiabetic overweight subjects with high VFA.Eighty overweight subjects with high VFA (L4 VFA ≥100 cm) were randomized into the 12-week mild-calorie-restriction (300 kcal/day) or control groups.Comparison of the percent of body weight changes between groups revealed that the weight-loss group had greater reductions in body weight. The VFA decreased by 17.7 cm from baseline in the weight-loss group (P < 0.001). At follow-up, the weight-loss group showed greater reductions in serum triglycerides, , and HOMA-IR than the control group. Significantly greater reductions in total saturated fatty acids, palmitic , stearic , total monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic , oleic , eicosadienoic , and dihomo-γ- levels were detected in the weight-loss group compared with the control group after adjusting for baseline values. Following weight loss, C16 Δ9-desaturase activity was significantly decreased and Δ5-desaturase activity was significantly increased, and the changes were greater in the weight-loss group than in the control group.The results suggest that mild weight loss improves abdominal obesity, overall fatty  profiles, and desaturase activities; therefore, mild calorie restriction has potential health benefits related to obesity-related diseases in overweight subjects with high VFA..

Exact relationship between saturated fatty acids (SFA) or PUFA and the  of diabetics are unknown.We investigated the relationship between the serum concentrations of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and the homeostasis model  index (HOMA-R) in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.The SFA, i.e., lauric , myristic , palmitic , and stearic ; the monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), i.e., palmitoleic , oleic , and erucic ; and the PUFA, i.e., eicosadienoic , dihomo-gamma-, docosatetraenoic , and docosapentaenoic  were positively correlated with HOMA-R. However, no correlations were found between HOMA-R and SFA, i.e., arachidic , behenic , and lignoceric ; the MUFA, i.e., eicosenoic  and nervonic ; and the PUFA, i.e., linoleic , gamma-, , 5-8-11 eicosatrienoic , arachidonic , eicosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic .Some PUFA as well as SFA were positively correlated with HOMA-R. These results indicate that the intake of diet fatty  must be well balanced in diabetic patients and it is not always true to refrain from taking SFA and increase the unsaturated fatty acids in their diets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27619894>n-3 Fatty acids preserve muscle mass and  sensitivity in a rat model of energy restriction.</a></h1><p>In obese subjects, the loss of fat mass during energy restriction is often accompanied by a loss of muscle mass. The hypothesis that n-3 PUFA, which modulate protein homoeostasis via effects on  sensitivity, could contribute to maintain muscle mass during energy restriction was tested in rats fed a high-fat diet (4 weeks) rich in 18 : 1 n-9 (oleic , OLE-R), 18 : 3 n-3 (α-, ALA-R) or n-3 long-chain (LC-R) fatty  and then energy restricted (8 weeks). A control group (OLE-ad libitum (AL)) was maintained with AL diet throughout the study. Rats were killed 10 min after an i.v.  injection. All energy-restricted rats lost weight and fat mass, but only the OLE-R group showed a significant muscle loss. The Gastrocnemius muscle was enriched with ALA in the ALA-R group and with LC-PUFA in the ALA-R and LC-R groups. The proteolytic ubiquitin-proteasome system was differentially affected by energy restriction, with MAFbx and muscle ring finger-1 mRNA levels being decreased in the LC-R group (-30 and -20 %, respectively). RAC-α serine/threonine-protein kinase and  receptor substrate 1 phosphorylation levels increased in the LC-R group (+70 %), together with  receptor mRNA (+50 %). The ALA-R group showed the same overall activation pattern as the LC-R group, although to a lesser extent. In conclusion, dietary n-3 PUFA prevent the loss of muscle mass associated with energy restriction, probably by an improvement in the -signalling pathway activation, in relation to enrichment of plasma membranes in n-3 LC-PUFA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25910408>Reduction in the desaturation capacity of the liver in mice subjected to high fat diet: Relation to LCPUFA depletion in liver and extrahepatic tissues.</a></h1><p>α- (ALA) and linoleic (LA) acids are precursors of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), FAs with important biochemical and physiological functions. In this process, desaturation reactions catalyzed by Δ5- and Δ6-desaturase play a major role, enzymes that are subjected to hormonal and dietary regulation. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of a high fat diet (HFD) on activity of liver Δ5 and Δ6 desaturases, in relation to LCPUFA composition in liver and extrahepatic tissues. Male C57BL/6J mice received control diet (CD) (10% fat, 20% protein and 70% carbohydrate) or high fat diet (HFD) (60% fat, 20% protein, and 20% carbohydrate) for 12 weeks. After this time, blood and liver samples were taken for metabolic, morphologic, inflammatory, oxidative stress and desaturase activity assessment, besides FA phospholipid analysis in erythrocytes, heart, adipose tissue and brain. HFD significantly increased hepatic total fat, triacylglycerides and free FA content with macrovesicular steatosis and oxidative stress enhancement, concomitantly with higher fasting serum glucose and  levels, HOMA, and serum cholesterol, triacylglycerols, TNF-α, and IL-6. Diminution in liver Δ5- and Δ6-desaturase activities and LCPUFA depletion were induced by HFD, the later finding being also observed in extrahepatic tissues. In conclusion, HFD-induced reduction in the bioavailability of liver LCPUFA is associated with defective desaturation of ALA and LA, with Δ5- and Δ6-desaturase activities being correlated with  development. Data analyzed point to the liver as a major organ responsible for extrahepatic LCPUFA homeostasis, which is markedly deranged by HFD.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The onset time of convulsion following cerebral hemorrhage was recorded, and the areas of hemorrhage and infarction were analyzed in the stroke brains.In comparison with 58-day survival of SHR-SP rats during feeding NaCl alone, perilla oil extended the survival time to 68.5 days, whereas canola oil shortened it to 45.7 days. Feeding perilla oil greatly reduced the total volume of cerebral hemorrhage from 17.27% in the control group to 4.53%, while shortening increased the lesions to 21.23%. In a microscopic analysis, perilla oil also markedly decreased the hemorrhagic and infarction lesions to 1/10 of those in control rats, in contrast to an exacerbating effect of shortening. In blood analyses, perilla oil reduced blood total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins which were increased in SHR-SP, but canola oil further increased them and markedly lowered platelet counts.Perilla oil delayed and attenuated cerebral hemorrhage by improving hyperlipidemia in hypertensive stroke animals, in contrast to the aggravating potential of canola oil and shortening. It is suggested that perilla oil should be the first choice oil for improving metabolic syndrome in hypertensive persons at risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16979408>Differential effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on metabolic control and vascular reactivity in the type 2 diabetic ob/ob mouse.</a></h1><p>Diets rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are recommended for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The American Heart Association recommends increasing intakes of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) to reduce the risk of vascular disease in high-risk individuals; however, the long-term effects of these bioactive fatty acids on glucose metabolism in  are controversial. The present studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of diets rich in both MUFA and  (C18:3n-3, ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5n-3, EPA), or docosahexaenoic  (C22:6n-3, DHA), on glycemic control and other parameters related to vascular health in a mouse model of T2DM and . Male ob/ob mice (n = 15 per treatment) were fed 1 of 4 lipid-modified formula diets (LFDs) for 4 weeks: (1) MUFA control, (2) ALA blend, (3) EPA blend, and (4) DHA blend. A portion of a MUFA-rich lipid blend in the control LFD was replaced with 11% to 14% energy as n-3 PUFA. After 4 weeks, plasma glucose response to a standard meal (1.5 g carbohydrate/kg body weight) and  challenge (2 U/kg body weight, IP) was assessed, and samples were collected for analysis of glucose, , and lipids. Vascular reactivity of isolated aortic rings was assessed in an identical follow-up study. The results showed that -resistant mice fed an LFD with EPA and/or DHA blends had significantly (P < .05) lower triglycerides and free fatty acids, but  sensitivity and fasting plasma glucose were not improved. However, mice fed with the ALA blend had significantly improved  sensitivity when compared to those fed with other LFD (P < .05). Animals fed an LFD with n-3 PUFA from marine or plant sources showed significantly improved vascular responses as compared with the MUFA-rich LFD (E(max), P < .05) and ob/ob reference mice consuming chow (E(max) and pEC(50), P < .05). In summary, long-term consumption of LFD with n-3 PUFAs improved blood lipids and vascular function in an animal model of  and T2DM; however, only MUFA-rich LFD with ALA also improved both  sensitivity and glycemic responses.

A 16-Week Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h1><p>Macronutrient composition of the diet influences the development of obesity and insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to assess the role of dietary fat quantity and fatty  composition in body composition, insulin resistance, and insulin secretion. An open parallel randomized trial design was used. Overweight participants ( = 75) were randomized to follow a low-fat vegan ( = 38) or control diet ( = 37) for 16 weeks. Dual X-ray absorptiometry was used to measure body composition. Insulin resistance was assessed with the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) index. Insulin secretion was assessed after stimulation with a liquid breakfast (Boost Plus, Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland). Self-reported 3-day diet records were used to assess dietary intake. A linear regression model was used to test the relationship between fat intake and body composition, insulin resistance, and insulin secretion. Changes in fat intake expressed as percent of total energy consumed correlated positively with changes in fat mass ( = 0.52;  < 0.001; and 0.347;  = 0.006, respectively), even after adjustment for changes in body-mass index (BMI) and energy intake (0.33;  = 0.01). Decreased intakes of C18:0 ( = 0.37,  = 0.004) and CLA-trans-10-cis12 ( = 0.40,  = 0.002), but increased intake of C18:2 ( = -0.40,  = 0.002) and C18:3 ( = -0.36,  = 0.006), were associated with a decrease in HOMA-IR, independent on changes in BMI and energy intake. The main fatty acids associated with changes in fasting insulin secretion were C12:0 ( = -0.31,  = 0.03), and TRANS 16:1 ( = -0.33,  = 0.02), both independent on changes in BMI and energy intake. Our findings demonstrate that, in the context of a low-fat vegan diet, decreased intake of saturated and trans fats and increased relative content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly linoleic and α- acids, are associated with decreased fat mass and insulin resistance, and enhanced insulin secretion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22894910>Goldilocks and the three bonds: new evidence for the conditional benefits of dietary α- in treating cardiovascular risk in the metabolic syndrome.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23369143>The role of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in human heart failure.</a></h1><p>n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been proposed as potential treatments for human heart failure. The cardioprotective effects of n-3 PUFA are supported by extensive cell culture, animal and human studies. Animal studies with n-3 PUFA have shown marked improvements in many independent risk factors for heart failure, including obesity, type II diabetes, , hypertension and inflammation. However, the evidence from observational studies, randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses that these benefits on risk factors lead to improvements in the symptoms of heart failure in patients is much less convincing. Further, most studies have used marine n-3 PUFA; the role of the plant-derived PUFA, α- (ALA), is even less clear.

Amounts of LC-PUFA depend on the exogenous intake of their precursors [linoleic (LA) and α- (ALA)] and by rate of their metabolism, which is influenced by activities of enzymes, such as Δ6-desaturase (D6D, FADS2), D5D, FADS1, elongases (Elovl2, -5, 6).Altered activities of D5D/D6D were described in plenty of diseases, e.g. neuropsychiatric (depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, dementia), metabolic (obesity, metabolic syndrome, DM2) and cardiovascular diseases (arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease), inflammatory states and allergy (Crohns disease, atopic eczema) or some malignancies. Similar results were obtained in studies dealing with the associations between genotypes/haplotypes of FADS1/FADS2 and above mentioned diseases, or interactions of dietary intake of LA and ALA on one hand and of the polymorphisms of minor allels of FADS1/FADS2, usually characterized by lower activities, on the other hand.The decrease of the desaturases activities leads to decreased concentrations of products with concomitant increased concentrations of substrates. Associations of some SNP FADS with coronary heart disease, concentrations of plasma lipids, oxidative stress, glucose homeostasis, and inflammatory reaction, were described.

We investigated the effects of a hypoenergetic diet with low energy density (ED) enriched in rapeseed oil, resulting in high MUFA content and an ALA intake of 3.5 g/d on body weight and cardiovascular risk profile in eighty-one patients with the metabolic syndrome in comparison with an olive oil diet rich in MUFA, but with a low ALA content. After a 6-month dietary intervention, body weight was significantly reduced in the rapeseed oil and olive oil groups ( -7.8 v. -6.0 kg; P < 0.05). There were significant decreases in systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, and  levels in both groups (P < 0.05). For all of these changes, no inter-group differences were observed. After the rapeseed oil diet, diastolic blood pressure declined more than after the olive oil diet (P < 0.05 for time × group interaction). Furthermore, concentrations of serum TAG were significantly reduced after the high ALA intake, but not in the low ALA group (P < 0.05 for time × group interaction).

Multiple stepwise regression models revealed that baPWV was significantly influenced by systolic blood pressure, age, body weight, triglyceride and LA in serum phospholipids (R(2) = 0.378). Interestingly, baPWV (1419 ± 1 cm/s) and MetS (22%) were highest in individuals with lower proportion of LA (< 12.361%) and higher proportion of DGLA (≥ 1.412%) in serum phospholipid FAs.The features of MetS significantly related to serum phosopholipid FA composition.

Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) according to their fatty  profiles showed that 29 tested samples could be clearly differentiated according to groups. More importantly, nervonic  (C24:1 n-9) and dihomo-γ- (C20:3 n-6) were identified as the potential fatty  biomarkers of PCOS and its IR complication, respectively, for their most contribution to group separation. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that C24:1 n-9 and C20:3 n-6 were well correlated with clinical characteristics of PCOS and IR indicators, respectively. These findings demonstrated that GC-MS-based plasma phospholipid fatty  profile might provide a complementary approach for clinical diagnosis of PCOS and its IR complication.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of chia oil (ChOi) supplementation on body composition and insulin signaling in skeletal muscles of obese mice.Male C57 BL/6 mice (n = 8/group) were fed regular control chow or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 135 d. Another HFD group additionally received ChOi from 90 to 135 d.Consumption of ChOi reduced fat mass accumulation and increased lean mass as evidenced by nuclear magnetic resonance. Moreover, obese mice treated with ChOi showed higher tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1, greater activation of protein kinase B, and increased translocation of glucose transporter type 4 in skeletal muscle tissue in response to insulin. ChOi supplementation improved glucose levels and insulin tolerance; decreased serum insulin, leptin, and triacylglycerols; and increased blood high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. All these effects caused by the use of ChOi seemed to be independent of the resolution of inflammation because the markers of inflammation were not altered in animals fed the HFD.The molecular effects observed in muscle tissue together with changes in body composition may have contributed to the increased glucose tolerance and to the healthy phenotype presented by obese animals treated with ChOi.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This work studied the increase in total FFA shown in NAFLD subjects to possibly characterize which fatty acids significantly accounted for the whole increase.21 patients with NAFLD were selected according to specified criteria. The control group consisted of nine healthy subjects. All subjects underwent an oral standard fat load. Triglycerides; cholesterol; FFA; glucose and  were measured every 2 h with the determination of fatty  composition of FFA.higher serum FFA levels in NAFLD subjects are mainly due to levels of oleic, palmitic and linoleic acids at different times. Significant increases were shown for docosahexaenoic , , eicosatrienoic , and arachidonic , although this was just on one occasion. In the postprandial phase, homeostatic model assessment HOMA index positively correlated with the ω3/ω6 ratio in NAFLD patients.the higher serum levels of FFA in NAFLD subjects are mainly due to levels of oleic and palmitic acids which are the most abundant circulating free fatty acids. This is almost exactly corresponded with significant increases in linoleic .

The results obtained from a number of experimental studies suggest that targeting different components of the inflammatory machinery may result in the improvement of the metabolic phenotype. Unsaturated fatty acids exert antiinflammatory activity through several distinct mechanisms. Here, we tested the capacity of ω3 and ω9 fatty acids, directly from their food matrix, to exert antiinflammatory activity through the G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)120 and GPR40 pathways. GPR120 was activated in liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues, reverting inflammation and  in obese mice. Part of this action was also mediated by GPR40 on muscle, as a novel mechanism described. Pair-feeding and immunoneutralization experiments reinforced the pivotal role of GPR120 as a mediator in the response to the nutrients. The improvement in  sensitivity in the high-fat substituted diets was associated with a marked reduction in tissue inflammation, decreased macrophage infiltration, and increased IL-10 levels. Furthermore, improved glucose homeostasis was accompanied by the reduced expression of hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes and reduced body mass. Thus, our data indicate that GPR120 and GPR40 play a critical role as mediators of the beneficial effects of dietary unsaturated fatty acids in the context of obesity-induced .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25641170>Proinflammatory effects of arachidonic  in a lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory microenvironment in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in vitro.</a></h1><p>Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), eicosapentaenoic  (20:5n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (22:6n-3, DHA), have known anti-inflammatory effects, including the modulation of adipose tissue-derived inflammatory mediators (i.e., adipokines) implicated in obesity-related pathologies, such as .

To study this, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with 100 μmol/L of various n-3 or n-6 PUFA with or without 10 ng/mL LPS for up to 24 h. AA in the presence of LPS synergistically increased (p < 0.05) pro-inflammatory monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP)-1 and interleukin (IL)-6 secretion and gene expression, as well as COX-2 and TLR2 gene expression at 6 and/or 24 h, suggesting their potential roles in the synergistic effects of AA and LPS. Plant-derived fatty acids ALA, SDA, and LA did not differentially affect adipokine gene expression or secretion, whereas LPS-induced pro-inflammatory IL-1β expression and MCP-1 secretion was decreased (p < 0.05) by EPA, DHA, and/or EPA+DHA (50 μmol/L each) compared with LPS alone. Only DHA increased (p < 0.05) gene expression of the n-3 PUFA receptor GPR120 and simultaneously decreased LPS-induced nuclear factor-κB activation compared with control.

Because acute free fatty  (FFA) elevation by lipid infusion reduces  sensitivity, we hypothesized that training status would alter accumulation of muscle triacylglycerol (TAG), diacylglycerol (DAG), ceramide, and acylcarnitine during acute FFA elevation. Trained (n = 15) and sedentary (n = 13) participants matched for age, sex, and BMI received either a 6-h infusion of lipid (20% Intralipid at 90 ml/h) or glycerol (2.25 g/100 ml at 90 ml/h) during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Muscle biopsies were taken at 0, 120, and 360 min after infusion initiation to measure intramyocellular concentrations of TAG, DAG, ceramides, and acylcarnitines by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Trained participants had a higher Vo2 max and  sensitivity than sedentary participants. The lipid infusion produced a comparable elevation of FFA (594 ± 90 μmol/l in trained, 721 ± 30 μmol/l in sedentary, P = 0.4) and a decline in  sensitivity (-44.7% trained vs. -47.2% sedentary, P = 0.89). In both groups, lipid infusion increased the linoleic and  content of TAG without changing total TAG. In the sedentary group, lipid infusion increased total, oleic, and linoleic  and  content of DAG. Regardless of training status, lipid infusion did not alter total ceramide, saturated ceramide, palmitoyl-carnitine, or oleoyl-carnitine. We conclude that during acute FFA elevation, trained adults have a similar decline in  sensitivity with less accumulation of muscle DAG than sedentary adults, suggesting that lipid-induced  can occur without elevation of total muscle DAG.Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16944615>Biological significance of essential fatty acids.</a></h1><p>Essential fatty acids (EFAs)--linoleic  (LA) and  (ALA) are critical for human survival. EFAs are readily available in the diet. But, to derive their full benefit, EFAs need to be metabolized to their respective long-chain metabolites. EFAs not only form precursors to respective prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), and leukotrienes (LTs), but also give rise to lipoxins (LXs), resolvins, isoprostanes, and hydroxy- and hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoates. Certain PGs, TXs, and LTs have pro-inflammatory actions whereas LXs and resolvins are anti-inflammatory in nature. Furthermore, EFAs and their long-chain metabolites modulate the activities of angiotensin converting and HMG-CoA reductase enzymes, enhance acetylcholine levels in the brain, increase the synthesis of endothelial nitric oxide, augment diuresis, and enhance  action. Thus, EFAs and their metabolites may function as endogenous ACE and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, nitric oxide enhancers, beta-blockers, diuretics, anti-hypertensive, and anti-atherosclerotic molecules. In addition, EFAs and their long-chain metabolites react with nitric oxide (NO) to yield respective nitroalkene derivatives that exert cell-signaling actions via ligation and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Thus, EFAs and their derivatives have varied biological actions that may have relevance to their involvement in several physiological and pathological processes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30145885>Flaxseed Oil Attenuates Hepatic Steatosis and  in Mice by Rescuing the Adaption to ER Stress.</a></h1><p>Increasing evidence has demonstrated the benefits of α--rich flaxseed oil (ALA-FO) against lipid metabolism abnormality in both rodent models and humans.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can have profound effects on inflammation through the formation of bioactive oxygenated metabolites called oxylipins. The objective of this study was to determine if exposure to the dietary omega-3 PUFA α- (ALA) can dampen the inflammatory properties of classically activated (M1-like) macrophages derived from the human THP-1 cell line and to examine the accompanying alterations in oxylipin secretion. We find that ALA treatment leads to a reduction in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α production. Although ALA is known to be converted to longer-chain PUFAs eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), DHA oxylipins were reduced overall by ALA treatment, as was LPS-induced secretion of EPA oxylipins. In contrast, we observed profound increases in oxylipins directly derived from ALA. Lipoxygenase products of linoleic  were also dramatically increased, and LPS-induced production of AA oxylipins, particularly prostaglandin D2, was reduced. These results suggest that ALA may act to dampen the inflammatory phenotype of M1-like macrophages by a unique set of mechanisms distinct from those used by the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. Thus, there is strong rationale for investigating the functions of ALA oxylipins and lesser-known LA oxylipins since they hold promise as anti-inflammatory agents.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized that as seen during the fasting state, the intake of a walnut-enriched meal increased postprandial adiponectin. Twenty-one healthy white men followed a 4-week baseline diet and then consumed 3 fat-loaded meals that included 1 g fat/kg body weight (65% fat) according to a randomized crossover design: olive oil-enriched meal (22% saturated fatty acids [SFA], 38% monounsaturated fatty acids [MUFA], 4% polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFA]), butter-enriched meal (35% SFA, 22% MUFA, 4% PUFA), and walnut-enriched meal (20% SFA, 24% MUFA, 16% PUFA, and 4% α-). Leptin, resistin, adiponectin, and free fatty acids were determined at 0, 3, 6, and 8.5 hours after the fat load. After the walnut-enriched meal, plasma adiponectin concentrations were higher at 3 and 6 hours (P = .011, P = .046, respectively) compared with the butter-enriched meal and higher at 6 hours compared with the olive oil-enriched meal (P = .036). Free fatty  levels decreased from baseline at 3 hours after the walnut-enriched meal (P = .001). No differences were observed between the 3 meals for leptin and resistin responses. Our data confirmed a beneficial profile in the postprandial response to walnuts, source of omega-3 PUFA with an increased postprandial adiponectin and lower postprandial free fatty  responses. These findings suggest that the postprandial state is important for understanding the possible cardioprotective effects associated with omega-3 PUFA dietary fat.© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The FADS2 product introduces a double bond at the Δ6, Δ4 and Δ8 positions by acting on at least ten substrates, including 16:0, 18:2n-6, and 18:3n-3. Our aim was to characterize the competition for accessing FADS2 mediated Δ6 desaturation between 16:0 and the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the human diet, 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3, to evaluate whether competition may be relevant in other tissues and thus linked to metabolic abnormalities associated with FADS2 or fatty  levels. MCF7 cells stably transformed with FADS2 biosynthesize 16:1n-10 from exogenous 16:0 in preference to 16:1n-7, the immediate product of SCD highly expressed in cancer cell lines, and 16:1n-9 via partial β-oxidation of 18:1n-9. Increasing availability of 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3 resulted in decreased bioconversion of 16:0 to 16:1n-10, simultaneously increasing the levels of highly unsaturated products. FADS2 cells accumulate the desaturation-elongation products 20:3n-6 and 20:4n-3 in preference to the immediate desaturation products 18:3n-6 and 18:4n-3 implying prompt/coupled elongation of the nascent desaturation products. MCF7 cells incorporate newly synthesized 16:1n-10 into phospholipids. These data suggest that excess 16:0 due to, for instance, de novo lipogenesis from high carbohydrate or alcohol consumption, inhibits synthesis of highly unsaturated fatty acids, and may in part explain why supplemental preformed EPA and DHA in some studies improves  and other factors related to diabetes and metabolic syndrome aggravated by excess calorie consumption.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to determine the FA profile and pro-antioxidant status in sarcopenic frail elderly patients enrolled in a nutritional and physical activity program and to evaluate their correlation with clinical markers. Moreover, the possible changes, produced after a short-term clinical protocol, were evaluated. Plasma and erythrocyte FA composition and pro-antioxidant status were analyzed in sarcopenic elderly subjects recruited for the randomized clinical study and treated with a placebo or dietary supplement, a personalized diet, and standardized physical activity. Subjects were tested before and after 30 days of treatment. Pearson correlations between biochemical parameters and patients' characteristics at recruitment indicate interesting features of sarcopenic status such as negative correlation among the plasma FA profile, age, and physical characteristics. Physical activity and dietetic program alone for 30 days induced a decrease of saturated FA concentration with a significant increase of dihomo-gamma-. Supplementation plus physical activity induced a significant decrease of linoleic , omega-6 polyunsaturated FAs, and an increase of stearic and oleic  concentration. Moreover, glutathione reductase activity, which is an indicator of antioxidant status, significantly increased in erythrocytes. Changes over time between groups indicate significant differences for saturated FAs, which suggest that the amino  supplementation restores FA levels that are consumed during physical activity. A relationship between FA and clinical/metabolic status revealed unique correlations and a specific metabolic and lipidomic fingerprint in sarcopenic elderly.

For SAT, 39 samples (n = 8, n = 10, n = 9, n = 12, respectively) were available. The mRNA expression was measured at baseline and 12 weeks by TaqMan® Low Density Array.In PBMCs, LF decreased ICAM1 mRNA expression (P < 0.05), which was different (P = 0.06, Bonferroni correction) from the observed increase in the FF group (P < 0.05). Also, compared to the control group, LF decreased ICAM1 mRNA expression (P < 0.05). Moreover, the change in ICAM1 mRNA expression correlated positively with the intake of FF (P < 0.05) and negatively with the intake of LF (P < 0.05), independently of study group.

Polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) metabolism is modulated in obesity. However, it has yet to be fully elucidated whether a serum PUFA profile is associated with hepatic steatosis.We aimed to clarify the relationship between a serum PUFA profile and liver lipid content.A cross-sectional study was conducted on 288 patients with dyslipidemia, diabetes, or coronary artery disease on statin therapy. Several PUFAs were measured, including eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), dihomo-γ- (DGLA) and arachidonic  (AA) in serum lipids, and Δ-5 desaturase (D5D) activity was estimated by AA to DGLA ratio. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) measured visceral fat area (VFA) and the ratio of CT attenuation for liver to spleen (L/S).The L/S ratio showed significant correlations with serum DGLA level and D5D activity (p<0.0001 for both). Serum DGLA level and D5D activity were significantly correlated with body mass index (BMI) or VFA, and with Homeostasis Model Assessment- (HOMA-IR) (p<0.0001 for all). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that a high DGLA level or low D5D activity was a significant determinant for hepatic steatosis (p<0.0001 for both) independent of BMI and HOMA-IR. ROC analysis revealed that they significantly enhanced the value of MetS-related factors in predicting hepatic steatosis (p<0.05 for both).A high DGLA level and low D5D activity in serum lipids may be useful markers predicting hepatic steatosis incrementally to MetS-related conventional factors.Copyright © 2016 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

Obese children were defined as those with a body mass index (BMI) greater than the 85(th) percentile for age and gender, based on Korean child growth standards.Activities of lipid desaturases, stearyl-CoAD (SCD-16,16:1n-7/16:0), delta-6D (D6D, 20:3n-6/18:2n-6), and delta-5D (D5D, 20:4n-6/20:3n-6), were estimated. Obese individuals had significantly higher proportions of palmitoleic  (16:1n-7) and dihomo-gamma  (DGLA, 20:3n-6) at both baseline and follow-up than did lean individuals. The activities of SCD-16 and D6D were higher in obese than lean boys. The baseline SCD-16 activity level was positively associated with the baseline waist circumference (WC) and the metabolic risk score. The baseline D6D level was positively associated with WC and also with the homeostasis model of assessment of  (HOMA-IR), a surrogate marker of  (IR), and metabolic risk score at both baseline and follow-up.In young Korean males, higher D6D activity predicts the future development of IR and associated metabolic disorders including dyslipidemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29937909>The effect of FADS2 gene rs174583 polymorphism on desaturase activities, fatty  profile, , biochemical indices, and incidence of type 2 diabetes.</a></h1><p>In this study, we investigated the associations of erythrocytes fatty  composition, activities of delta-5 desaturase (D5D) and delta-6 desaturase (D6D), and other metabolic risk factors, with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk to determine if rs174583 polymorphism of FADS2 gene had any effect on these associations.Fatty  profile of erythrocytes was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in 95 T2D patients and 95 apparently healthy participants. The genotypes of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of FADS2 gene were determined using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Other biochemical parameters were measured in the serum using standard analytical procedures.D6D activity was increased ( < 0.001) and D5D activity was decreased in T2D patients ( < 0.001) compared to controls. Homeostatic model assessment  (HOMA-IR) index was positively correlated with D6D ( = 0.34,  < 0.001) and negatively correlated with D5D ( = -0.19,  = 0.02). Palmitic  ( < 0.001) and dihomo-gamma- ( = 0.03) were higher and linoleic  ( < 0.001) and arachidonic  (AA) ( < 0.001) were lower in T2D patients. The distribution of rs174583 genotypes which includes C/T, C/C, and T/T was not different in the two groups ( = 0.63).In the population studied, there was a strong association in the erythrocytes fatty  composition, D5D and D6D activities and other metabolic risk factors between non-T2D and T2D patients. In addition, there was a strong association in erythrocytes DGLA and AA contents and D5D activities between rs174583 genotypes in all participants. However, the distribution of rs174583 genotypes did not differ significantly between T2D patient and controls, and it did not appear to be an association between rs174583 SNP and incident of T2D.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21307609>Docosahexaenoic  content in plasma phospholipids and desaturase indices in obese children.</a></h1><p>In obesity, fatty  composition is altered with reduced docosahexaenoic  (DHA) levels. Desaturating enzymes, stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), delta-6 desaturase (D6D) and delta-5 desaturase (D5D) modulate fatty  composition and are thus associated with the development of metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study was to identify the relationships among DHA content, desaturase indices and the components of metabolic syndrome in childhood obesity.Thirty-two obese children (27 male, 5 female) aged 12.0±2.6 years (mean±SD), with a relative body weight greater than 120% of the standard weight for sex, age and height, were recruited. Fatty  composition of plasma phospholipids was analyzed by gas chromatography, and the desaturase indices were assessed: SCD (16:1n-7/16:0 and 18:1n-9/18:0), D6D (20:3n-6/18:2n-6) and D5D (20:4n-6/20:3n-6).No sex difference was observed in fatty  composition. DHA content tended to have an inverse association with body mass index (BMI) (r=-0.337, p=0.0592), and correlated significantly with very low-density lipoprotein-triglyceride (r=-0.558, p=0.0057). In addition, DHA content had significant negative relationships with SCD indices (SCD16; r=-0.373, p=0.0357 and SCD18; r=-0.580, p=0.0005), which correlated positively with BMI(r=0.439, p=0.0120, r=0.353, p=0.0473, respectively), but had no association with D5D or D6D.DHA content in obese children was independent of the desaturation of . Reduced DHA content was associated with increased SCD index, and might contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome.

The cells absorb LDLP via apoB-100 endocytosis and VLDLP through apoE/B-100 receptors. VLDLP consist of palmitic and oleic VLDLP and LDLP of linoleic and  LDLP. The contribution of LDLP to the development of HLP atherosclerosis and atheromatosis is negligible. LDLP form palmitic and oleic VLDLP with hydrated LDLP density. Blockade of LDLP absorption by apoB endocytosis and deficit of poly-FA constitute the etiological basis of atherosclerosis. Its pathogenetic basis is the excess of palmitic VLDLP with LDPL density in the intercellular space that block absorption of linoleic LDLP with all transferred SC poly-FA. Atheromatosis is clinically and prognostically most significant symptom of atherosclerosis associated with accumulation of ligand-free VLDLP and LDLP in arterial intima of the elastic type as the local pool of interstitial tissue for intravascular pool of intercellular medium.

It has been shown that, compared with food-restricted rats refed a high-fat (lard) diet low in PUFA, those refed isoenergetically on diets enriched in LA or ALA, independently of the n-6:n-3 ratio, show improved  sensitivity, lower fat mass and higher lean mass, the magnitude of which is related to the proportion of total PUFA precursors (LA+ALA) consumed. These relationships are best fitted by quadratic regression models (r2>0·8, P < 0·001), with threshold values for an impact on body composition corresponding to PUFA precursors contributing 25-30 % of energy intake. Isoenergetic refeeding on high-fat diets enriched in AA or DHA also led to improved body composition, with increases in lean mass as predicted by the quadratic model for PUFA precursors, but decreases in fat mass, which are disproportionately greater than predicted values;  sensitivity, however, was not improved. These findings pertaining to the impact of dietary intake of PUFA precursors (LA and ALA) and their elongated-desaturated products (AA and DHA), on body composition and  sensitivity, provide important insights into the search for diets aimed at counteracting the pathophysiological consequences of catch-up growth. In particular, diets enriched in essential fatty acids (LA and/or ALA) markedly improve  sensitivity and composition of weight regained, independently of the n-6:n-3 fatty  ratio.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25889505> in maternal diet halts the lipid disarray due to saturated fatty acids in the liver of mice offspring at weaning.</a></h1><p> (ALA, 18:3) in maternal diets has been shown to attenuate obesity associated  (IR) in adult offspring in mice. The objective in the present study was to detect the early effects of maternal dietary saturated fatty acids (SFA) and their partial substitution with ω-3 ALA, docosa hexenoic  (DHA,22:6) and eicosapentenoic  20:5 (EPA,20:5) on the HOMA index, liver lipids and fatty  desaturases in the offspring at weaning.3 month old C57Bl6/J female mice were fed diets containing normal amount of calories but rich in SFA alone or partially replaced with ALA, DHA or EPA before mating, during pregnancy and lactation.Pregnant mice fed SFA produced offspring with the highest HOMA index, liver lipids and desaturase activities. ALA prevented SFA induced lipid increase but DHA and EPA only reduced it by 42% and 31% respectively. ALA, DHA and EPA decreased HOMA index by 84%, 75% and 83% respectively. ALA, DHA and EPA decreased Δ6 and SCD1 desaturase activities about 30%.SFA feeding to mothers predisposes their offspring to develop IR and liver lipid accumulation already at weaning. ω3 fatty acids reduce IR, ALA halts lipid accumulation whereas DHA and EPA only blunt it.ALA and DHA restore the increased SCD1 to normal. These studies suggest that ω-3 fatty acids have different potencies to preclude lipid accumulation in the offspring partially by affecting pathways associated to SCD1 modulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29877283>Increased Serum Dihomo-γ- Levels Are Associated with Obesity, Body Fat Accumulation, and  in Japanese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h1><p>Objective To clarify the associations between serum omega-6 (n-6) and omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) levels and obesity-related metabolic abnormalities in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods and Materials Data from 225 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes were cross-sectionally analyzed. The serum levels of n-6 PUFAs [dihomo-γ- (DGLA) and arachidonic  (AA)] and n-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic ) were measured, and the estimated Δ-5 desaturase (D5D) activity was calculated based on the AA to DGLA ratio. The associations between the composition of PUFAs and obesity-related parameters, including the body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, alanine amino transferase (ALT) level, homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR), and body fat percentage, as measured by a bioelectrical impedance analysis, were analyzed. Results Among the PUFAs, the DGLA level had the strongest correlations with BMI (p<0.001), waist circumference (p<0.001), ALT level (p<0.001), HOMA-IR (p<0.001), and body fat percentage (p<0.01). AA was positively correlated and D5D was negatively correlated with several obesity-related parameters, while n-3 PUFAs did not have a constant correlation. A multivariate regression analysis revealed that the DGLA level was an independent determinant for HOMA-IR (β=0.195, p=0.0066) after adjusting for sex, age, BMI, and the ALT, triglyceride, and HbA1c levels. Conclusion A high serum DGLA level was associated with obesity, body fat accumulation, a high ALT level, and  in patients with type 2 diabetes. The measurement of the serum PUFA levels may be useful for evaluating metabolic abnormalities and estimating the dietary habits of patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24029409>Are conjugated  isomers an alternative to conjugated linoleic  isomers in obesity prevention?</a></h1><p>Despite its benefits, conjugated linoleic  (CLA) may cause side effects after long-term administration. Because of this and the controversial efficacy of CLA in humans, alternative biomolecules that may be used as functional ingredients have been studied in recent years. Thus, conjugated  (CLNA) has been reported to be a potential anti-obesity molecule which may have additional positive effects related to obesity. According to the results reported in obesity, CLNA needs to be given at higher doses than CLA to be effective. However, because of the few studies conducted so far, it is still difficult to reach clear conclusions about the potential use of these CLNAs in obesity and its related changes (, dyslipidemia, or inflammation).Copyright © 2012 SEEN.

However, many of these compounds with in vitro activity fail to respond in vivo, probably due to the sophistication of the physiological energy regulatory networks. In this context, C. elegans has emerged as a plausible model for the identification and characterization of the effect of such compounds on fat storage in a complete organism. However, the results obtained in such a simple model are not easily extrapolated to more complex organisms such as mammals, which hinders its application in the short term. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain new experimental data about the evolutionary conservation of the mechanisms of fat loss between worms and mammals. Previously, we found that some omega-6 fatty acids promote fat loss in C. elegans by up-regulation of peroxisomal fatty  β-oxidation in an omega-3 independent manner. In this work, we prove that the omega-6 fatty acids' effects on worms are also seen when they are supplemented with a natural omega-6 source (borage seed oil, BSO). Additionally, we explore the anti-obesity effects of two doses of BSO in a diet-induced obesity rat model, validating the up-regulation of peroxisomal fatty  β-oxidation. The supplementation with BSO significantly reduces body weight gain and energy efficiency and prevents white adipose tissue accumulation without affecting food intake. Moreover, BSO also increases serum HDL-cholesterol levels, improves  and promotes the down-regulation of Cebpa, an adipogenesis-related gene. Therefore, we conclude that the effects of omega-6 fatty acids are highly conserved between worms and obesity-induced mammals, so these compounds could be considered to treat or prevent obesity-related disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18460483>Flaxseed and cardiovascular risk factors: results from a double blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial.</a></h1><p>Flaxseed is a rich source of  (ALA), fiber and lignans, making it a potentially attractive functional food for modulating cardiovascular risk. We studied the effects of flaxseed on markers of cardiovascular risk in hypercholesterolemic adults.Sixty-two men and post-menopausal women with pre-study low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) between 130 and 200 mg/dl were randomized to 40g/day of ground flaxseed-containing baked products or matching wheat bran products for 10 weeks while following a low fat, low cholesterol diet. Fasting lipoproteins, measures of , inflammation, oxidative stress, and safety were assessed at 0, 5 and 10 weeks.Flaxseed was well-tolerated, and increased serum levels of ALA (p < 0.001). Compared to wheat, flaxseed significantly reduced LDL-C at 5 weeks (-13%, p < 0.005), but not at 10 weeks (-7%, p = 0.07). Flaxseed reduced lipoprotein a (Lp[a]) by a net of 14% (p = 0.02), and reduced the homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) index by 23.7% (p = 0.03) compared to wheat at 10 weeks, but did not affect markers of inflammation (IL-6, Hs-CRP) or oxidative stress (ox LDL, urinary isoprostanes) at any time points. In men, flaxseed reduced HDL-C concentrations by a net of 16% (p = 0.03) and 9% (p = 0.05) at 5 and 10 weeks, respectively.Ground flaxseed has a modest but short lived LDL-C lowering effect, yet reduces Lp(a) and improves  sensitivity in hyperlipidemic adults.

It is known that patients with MS exhibit a heterogeneous phenotype; however, the relationships of individual FA to MS components have not yet been consistently studied. We examined the plasma phosphatidylcholine FA composition of 166 individuals (68F/98M) with MS and of 188 (87F/101M) controls. Cluster analysis of FA divided the groups into two clusters. In cluster 1, there were 65.7 % of MS patients and 37.8 % of controls, cluster 2 contained 34.3 % of patients and 62.2 % of controls (P<0.001). Those with MS within cluster 1 (MS1) differed from individuals with MS in cluster 2 (MS2) by concentrations of glucose (P<0.05), NEFA (P<0.001), HOMA-IR (P<0.05), and levels of conjugated dienes in LDL (P<0.05). The FA composition in MS1 group differed from MS2 by higher contents of palmitoleic (+30 %), gamma- (+22 %), dihomo-gamma- (+9 %) acids and by a lower content of linoleic  (-25 %) (all P<0.01).

Arachidonic  (AA), the product of n-6 LCPUFA, is reported to be related to . The purpose of the present paper was to investigate the LCPUFA profile in obese children and mechanisms that contribute to reduced AA content.An age- and sex-matched control study was performed. The study subjects were 59 obese children (mean age, 11.8 years) and 53 healthy non-obese children (mean age, 12.5 years). The study parameters included anthropometric measurements, serum lipids, leptin and fatty  composition in plasma.Plasma fatty acids in obese children had lower linoleic  (P < 0.0001) and higher dihomo-gamma- (P = 0.0004) than those in non-obese children. In all subjects combined, delta-6 desaturase (D6D) index (ratios of [C 18:3n-6+C 20:2n-6]/C 20:4n-6 or C 20:4n-6/C 18: 2n-6) correlated with leptin (P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in AA content between obese and non-obese. However, the AA content was low (<mean - 1SD in controls) in 27.1% of obese children, in whom D6D index was not elevated in spite of high  concentration.Obese children had changes in plasma LCPUFA profile that indicate upregulation of n-6 LCPUFA metabolism, probably caused by activated D6D activity to compensate AA demand.

Growing evidence indicates that a healthy diet rich in fruit, vegetables, nuts, extra-virgin olive oil and fish has beneficial effects in both the prevention and management of several human diseases and metabolic disorders. In this review, we discuss the latest data concerning the effects of dietary bioactive compounds such as polyphenols and PUFA on the molecular mechanisms regulating glucose homoeostasis. Several studies, mostly based on in vitro and animal models, indicate that dietary polyphenols, mainly flavonoids, positively modulate the  signalling pathway by attenuating hyperglycaemia and , reducing inflammatory adipokines, and modifying microRNA (miRNA) profiles. Very few data about the influence of dietary exposure on GDM outcomes are available, although this approach deserves careful consideration.

In this double-blind trial, we studied the effects on 160 overweight volunteers (body mass index, BMI >30) of a 90 days experimental diet rich principally in animal fat with a low PUFA/saturated fatty  (SFA) ratio but a low n-6/n-3 ratio, using animal products obtained from linseed-fed animals. The control diet provided less animal fat, a higher PUFA/SFA ratio and a higher n-6/n-3 ratio. Both diets excluded seafood. In the experimental group, we observed a significant increase in red blood cell (RBC)  content and a slight increase in EPA and DHA derivatives, while in the control group we observed a significant reduction in EPA and DHA content. Between groups now, the difference in the three n-3 fatty acids changes in RBC was significant. This demonstrates that plasma EPA and DHA levels can be maintained without fish if products from linseed-fed animals are used. During the diets, we noted a significant reduction in weight, BMI and hip circumference within both groups of volunteers. However, no significant difference was observed between the control group and the experimental group. Interestingly, 150 days after the end of the trial (i.e., day 240), we noted a significant weight gain in the control group, whereas no significant weight gain was observed in the experimental group. This was also observed for the BMI and hip circumference. Moreover, significant differences in BMI (P < 0.05) and weight (P = 0.05) appeared between the two groups, showing in both cases a smaller increase in the experimental group. During the 90 days trial, we did not observe any differences between groups in terms of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol or triglycerides, suggesting that the saturate content and the P/S ratio are not as important as the n-6 and n-3 fatty  composition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26233865>Cytokines, angiogenic, and antiangiogenic factors and bioactive lipids in preeclampsia.</a></h1><p>Preeclampsia is a low-grade systemic inflammatory condition in which oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction occurs. Plasma levels of soluble receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR)-1, also known as sFlt1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1), an antiangiogenic factor have been reported to be elevated in preeclampsia. It was reported that pregnant mice deficient in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity show a preeclampsia-like phenotype due to a deficiency or absence of 2-methoxyoestradiol (2-ME), a natural metabolite of estradiol that is elevated during the third trimester of normal human pregnancy. Additionally, autoantibodies (AT1-AAs) that bind and activate the angiotensin II receptor type 1 a (AT1 receptor) also have a role in preeclampsia. None of these abnormalities are consistently seen in all the patients with preeclampsia and some of them are not specific to pregnancy. Preeclampsia could occur due to an imbalance between pro- and antiangiogenic factors. VEGF, an angiogenic factor, is necessary for the transport of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to endothelial cells. Hence reduced VEGF levels decrease the availability of PUFAs to endothelial cells. This leads to a decrease in the formation of anti-inflammatory and angiogenic factors: lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins from PUFAs. Lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, maresins, and PUFAs suppress ; activation of leukocytes, platelets, and macrophages; production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α; and oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction; and enhance production of prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO). Estrogen enhances the formation of lipoxin A4 and NO. PUFAs also augment the production of NO and inhibit the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and antagonize the actions of angiotensin II. Thus, PUFAs can prevent activation of angiotensin II receptor type 1 a (AT1 receptor). Patients with preeclampsia have decreased plasma phospholipid concentrations of arachidonic  (AA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), the precursors of lipoxins (from AA), resolvins (from EPA and DHA), and protectins (from DHA) and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1 from DGLA: dihomo-γ-) and prostacyclin (PGI2 derived from AA). Based on these evidences, it is proposed that preeclampsia may occur due to deficiency of PUFAs and their anti-inflammatory products: lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study explored interactions between dietary fat intake and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA) -308 G/A polymorphism on obesity, , and serum lipid concentrations in urbanized black SA women. Normal-weight (n = 105) and obese (n = 118) women underwent measurements of body composition, fat distribution, fasting serum lipids, glucose and  concentrations, and dietary intake. Participants were genotyped for the functional TNFA -308 G/A polymorphism. The genotype or allele frequency of the TNFA -308 G/A polymorphism did not differ between the BMI groups. However, when dietary fat intake was 30% of total energy intake [percentage energy (%E)], the odds of being obese with the TNFA GA+AA genotype was only 12% of that with GG, but increasing intake of dietary fat (%E) was associated with a significantly faster rate of increase in obesity risk in women with the TNFA GA+AA genotype compared with those with the GG genotype (P = 0.036). There were significant diet-gene interactions between  (%E) and the total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio (P = 0.036), and PUFA (%E) and LDL cholesterol levels (P = 0.026), with participants with the A allele being more responsive to changes in relative fat intake.

Main causes of NAFLD comprise high caloric intake and a sedentary lifestyle, with high intakes of saturated FAs.The review includes several searches considering the effects of n-3 LCPUFAs in NAFLD in vivo and in vitro models, using the PubMed database from the National Library of Medicine-National Institutes of Health.The LCPUFAs eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5 n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (C22:6 n-3, DHA) have a positive effect in diminishing liver steatosis, OS, and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and pro-inflammatory cytokines, with improvement of insulin sensitivity and adiponectin levels. The molecular pathways described for n-3 LCPUFAs in cellular and animal models and humans include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α activation favouring FA oxidation, diminution of lipogenesis due to sterol responsive element binding protein-1c downregulation and inflammation resolution. Besides, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 activation is elicited by n-3 LCPUFA-derived oxidation products producing direct and indirect antioxidant responses, with concomitant anti-fibrogenic action.The discussed effects of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation support its use in NAFLD, although having a limited value in , a contention that may involve n-3 LCPUFA oxygenated derivatives.
