Clinically, there are several therapies to promote blood circulation and dissipate blood stasis; these treatment options include ginkgolide B (GB), which has PAF (platelet activating factor) inhibiting effects. PAF-receptor (PAF-R) antagonists are used to treat a variety of inflammatory diseases, however, the potential of PAF-R antagonists as a treatment for lung infections remains unclear. The aim of the present study is to investigate the protective effect of GB on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in A549 human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiC) in vitro. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured by CCK-8 and flow cytometry. TRIM37, Caspase-3, and NF-κBp65 expression levels were measured by real-time PCR and western blotting. The release of TNF-α and IL-1β was measured by ELISA. The data indicates that GB may reduce TRIM37 expression by antagonizing the PAF-R pathway, thereby inhibiting the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and alleviating the inflammatory response of alveolar epithelial cells. This study is the first to provide insight into the therapeutic potential of GB and suggests that clinical application of GB in acute stroke combined with pulmonary  may be efficacious.

However, human milk composition may change due to geographic and ethnic variation. This study investigated the variation of the Chinese human milk serum proteome based on mothers with different ethnicities living in different parts of China, using TMT labeling combined with Nano-LC Q Exactive HF MS/MS proteomics. In total, 693 proteins were identified and quantified in human milk serum from Yunnan (Han and Bai ethnicity), Gansu (Han and Tibetan ethnicity), Xinjiang (Uygur ethnicity), and Inner Mongolia (Mongolian ethnicity). The biological function distribution of identified proteins and the summed intensity of proteins belonging to each biological function were similar among groups. The five relatively highly abundant milk serum proteins, lactoferrin, serum albumin, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, macrophage mannose receptor 1, and bile salt-activated lipase were not significantly different among different geographies and ethnicities. On the other hand, we found 34 proteins that did significantly differ with geography and ethnicity. Those significantly different proteins have known strong interaction in  response and regulation of multi-organism processes. Taken together, biological function distribution was similar on both the qualitative and quantitative levels, and proteins with similar abundance are important in providing basic nutrition and protection for infants, whereas the significantly different proteins may be important for the healthy development of infants from different locations and ethnicities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695465>How Western Diet And Lifestyle Drive The Pandemic Of Obesity And Civilization Diseases.</a></h2><p>Westernized populations are plagued by a plethora of chronic non-infectious degenerative diseases, termed as "civilization diseases", like obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease and many more, diseases which are rare or virtually absent in hunter-gatherers and other non-westernized populations. There is a growing awareness that the cause of this amazing discrepancy lies in the profound changes in diet and lifestyle during recent human history. This paper shows that the transition from Paleolithic nutrition to Western diets, along with lack of corresponding genetic adaptations, cause significant distortions of the fine-tuned metabolism that has evolved over millions of years of human evolution in adaptation to Paleolithic diets. With the increasing spread of Western diet and lifestyle worldwide, overweight and civilization diseases are also rapidly increasing in developing countries. It is suggested that the diet-related key changes in the developmental process include an increased production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress, development of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, low-grade  and an abnormal activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system, all of which play pivotal roles in the development of diseases of civilization. In addition, diet-related epigenetic changes and fetal programming play an important role. The suggested pathomechanism is also able to explain the well-known but not completely understood close relationship between obesity and the wide range of comorbidities, like type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, etc., as diseases of the same etiopathology. Changing our lifestyle in accordance with our genetic makeup, including diet and physical activity, may help prevent or limit the development of these diseases.© 2019 Kopp.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695471>Linagliptin Inhibits Lipopolysaccharide-Induced  Concentration-Dependently And -Independently.</a></h2><p>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, including linagliptin, prevent . However, the in vitro effects of linagliptin are unclear. Moreover, although linagliptin inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced , the anti-inflammatory effects of linagliptin in this context are not concentration-dependent. In the absence of LPS-binding protein (LBP), the pro-inflammatory effects of LPS involve pathways other than the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 pathway. Here, we aimed to determine the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of linagliptin in an experimental model in which LBP was added to the medium.Human U937 monocytes were cultured at 1 × 10 cells/mL in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium and differentiated into macrophages using phorbol myristate acetate. All processes were carried out in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). After 48 hrs of culture, we replaced the medium and pretreated the cells with 100, 250, 500, or 2500 nM linagliptin for 1 hr. We exchanged the medium again, and the cells were treated with 1 ng/mL LPS with or without 100, 250, 500, or 2500 nM linagliptin. Interleukin (IL)-6 and LBP in the supernatant, nuclear factor (NF)-κB/p65 in the nucleus, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells, as important markers of the mechanism of  induction by LPS, were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits.Linagliptin significantly prevented LPS-stimulated IL-6 production and intranuclear NF-κB/p65 levels in a concentration-dependent manner. LPS-induced intracellular ROS levels were significantly decreased by linagliptin at all concentrations. LBP levels were markedly higher in FBS-containing medium than in medium without FBS. However, LBP levels did not change following administration of linagliptin and/or LPS.Concentration-dependent and -independent inflammatory suppression was observed following linagliptin treatment in the context of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory responses. Thus, our findings suggested that linagliptin induced two different mechanisms to repress , i.e., TLR4-dependent and -independent mechanisms.© 2019 Sato et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692444>Consideration of a Pharmacological Combinatorial Approach to Inhibit Chronic  in Alzheimer's Disease.</a></h2><p>A combinatorial cocktail approach is suggested as a rationale intervention to attenuate chronic  and confer neuroprotection in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The requirement for an assemblage of pharmacological compounds follows from the host of pro-inflammatory pathways and mechanisms present in activated microglia in the disease process. This article suggests a starting point using four compounds which present some differential in anti-inflammatory targets and actions but a commonality in showing a finite permeability through blood-brain barrier (BBB). A basis for first- choice compounds demonstrated neuroprotection in animal models (thalidomide and minocycline), clinical trial data showing some slowing in the progression of pathology in AD brain (ibuprofen) and indirect evidence for putative efficacy in blocking oxidative damage and chemotactic response mediated by activated microglia (dapsone). It is emphasized that a number of candidate compounds, other than ones suggested here, could be considered as components of the cocktail approach and would be expected to be examined in subsequent work. In this case, systematic testing in AD animal models is required to rigorously examine the efficacy of first-choice compounds and replace ones showing weaker effects. This protocol represents a practical approach to optimize the reduction of microglial-mediated chronic  in AD pathology. Subsequent work would incorporate the anti-inflammatory cocktail de- livery as an adjunctive treatment with ones independent of  as an overall preventive strategy to slow the progression of AD.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694814>Increased risk of multiple myeloma in primary Sjögren's syndrome is limited to individuals with Ro/SSA and La/SSB autoantibodies.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694627>Difficult iatrogenic bile duct injuries following different types of upper abdominal surgery: report of three cases and review of literature.</a></h2><p>Iatrogenic bile duct injuries (BDIs) are mostly associated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy but may also occur following gastroduodenal surgery or liver resection. Delayed diagnosis of type of injury with an ongoing biliary leak as well as the management in a non-specialized general surgical units are still the main factors affecting the outcome.Herein we present three types of BDIs (Bismuth type I, IV and V) following three different types of upper abdominal surgery, ie. Billroth II gastric resection, laparoscopic cholecystectomy and left hepatectomy. All of them were complex injuries with complete bile duct transections necessitating surgical treatment. All were also very difficult to treat mainly because of a delayed diagnosis of type of injury, associated biliary leak and as a consequence severe inflammatory changes within the liver hilum. The treatment was carried out in our specialist hepatobiliary unit and first focused on infection and  control with adequate biliary drainage. This was followed by a delayed surgical repair with the technique which had to be tailored to the type of injury in each case.We emphasize that staged and individualized treatment strategy is often necessary in case of a delayed diagnosis of complex BDIs presenting with a biliary leak, inflammatory intraabdominal changes and infection. Referral of such patients to expert hepatobiliary centres is crucial for the outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692901>Targeting inducible epigenetic reprogramming pathways in chronic airway remodeling.</a></h2><p>Allergic asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease whose clinical course is punctuated by acute exacerbations from aeroallergen exposure or respiratory virus infections. Aeroallergens and respiratory viruses stimulate toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, producing oxidative injury and . Repetitive exacerbations produce complex mucosal adaptations, cell-state changes, and structural remodeling. These structural changes produce substantial morbidity, decrease lung capacity, and impair quality of life. We will review recent systems-level studies that provide fundamental new insights into how repetitive activation of innate signaling pathways produce epigenetic 'training' to induce adaptive epithelial responses. Oxidative stress produced downstream of TLR signaling induces transient oxidation of guanine bases in the regulatory regions of inflammatory genes. The epigenetic mark 8-oxoG is bound by a pleiotropic DNA repair enzyme, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), which induces conformational changes in adjacent DNA to recruit the NFκB·bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) complex. The NFκB·BRD4 complex not only plays a central role in , but also triggers mesenchymal transition and extracellular matrix remodeling. Small molecule inhibitors of OGG1-8-oxoG binding and BRD4-acetylated histone interaction have been developed. We present studies demonstrating efficacy of these in reducing airway  in preclinical models. Targeting inducible epigenetic reprogramming pathway shows promise for therapeutics in reversing airway remodeling in a variety of chronic airway diseases.Copyright © 2019 Brasier AR, Boldogh I.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696583>Role of aspirin-triggered lipoxin A4, aspirin and salicylic acid in the modulation of the oxidative and inflammatory responses induced by plasma from women with preeclampsia.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress and  are key events leading to preeclampsia, involved in several maternal deaths. Low doses of Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) are used in prevention and treatment of preeclampsia. The synthesis of aspirin-triggered lipoxin (ATL) by cyclooxygenase-2 acetylation is an alternative mechanism of ASA, which could explain the effectiveness of ASA treatments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of ASA, salicylates and ATL in the modulation of the oxidative and inflammatory responses induced by plasma from women with preeclampsia.Plasma from 14 women with preeclampsia and 17 normotensive pregnant women were probed for inducing oxidative and inflammatory responses on endothelial cells and U937 promonocytes. The role of ATL, ASA, and salicylic acid (SA) on these events was evaluated.Plasma from women with preeclampsia induced TBARS and nitrotyrosine production on endothelial and U937 cells. Pre-treatment with both ATL and ASA decreased the TBARS production while ATL decreased the nitrotyrosine. Preeclamptic plasma augmented the translocation of NF-kB on U937 cells, which decreased by a high dose of ASA and SA. Finally, the preeclamptic plasma increased the adhesion of leukocytes -PMN and monocytes- to endothelium and we were able to determine a state of resolution of , since ATL decreased the PMN adhesion and conversely, it increased the monocytes adhesion to endothelium.Together, these results suggest that ATL could explain the beneficial actions of ASA and support further research on mechanisms, real efficacy, and rational use of ASA in preeclampsia.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, to our knowledge, a sequestrated lung manifesting vascular changes with both arteritis and a plexiform lesion has never been reported. A 25-year-old man was diagnosed with intralobar pulmonary sequestration. Pathologically, both arteritis and a plexiform lesion were observed in the sequestrated lung. Systemic vasculitis syndrome was clinically excluded, and the pathological findings appeared to be associated with local PH. Arteritis is an extremely rare finding; only one case of arteritis associated with local PH has been reported in intralobar sequestration. In this case, the artery near the plexiform lesion had milder  and fibrosis, suggesting that the arteritis formed prior to the plexiform lesion. This is the first case of arteritis and a plexiform lesion co-occurring in intralobar pulmonary sequestration associated with local PH. This case may shed light on the formation of plexiform lesions and their association with arteritis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692054>Chrm3 protects against acinar cell necrosis by stabilizing caspase-8 expression in severe acute pancreatitis mice model.</a></h2><p>Acinar cells in acute pancreatitis (AP) die through apoptosis and necrosis, the impacts of which are quite different. Early clinical interference strategies on preventing the progress of AP to severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) are the elimination of  response and inhibition of necrosis. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 was encoded by Chrm3 gene. It is one of the best-characterized receptors of pancreatic β cells and regulates insulin secretion, but its function in AP remains unclear. In this study, we explored the function of Chrm3 gene in the regulation of cell death in l-arginine-induced SAP animal models. We found that Chrm3 was upregulated in pancreatitis, and we further confirmed the localization of Chrm3 resided in both pancreatic islets and acinar cell membranes. The reduction of Chrm3 decreased the pathological lesion of SAP and reduced amylase activities in serum. Consistently, Chrm3 can suppress acinar cells necrosis markedly, but has no effect on regulating apoptosis after l-arginine treatment. It was shown that Chrm3 attenuated acinar cells necrosis at least in part by stabilizing caspase-8. Thus, this study indicates that Chrm3 is critical participants in SAP, and regulation of Chrm3 expression might be a useful therapeutic strategy for preventing pathologic necrosis.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694154>Multiple Sclerosis: Melatonin, Orexin, and Ceramide Interact with Platelet Activation Coagulation Factors and Gut-Microbiome-Derived Butyrate in the Circadian Dysregulation of Mitochondria in Glia and Immune Cells.</a></h2><p>Recent data highlight the important roles of the gut microbiome, gut permeability, and alterations in mitochondria functioning in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS). This article reviews such data, indicating two important aspects of alterations in the gut in the modulation of mitochondria: (1) Gut permeability increases toll-like receptor (TLR) activators, viz circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and exosomal high-mobility group box (HMGB)1. LPS and HMGB1 increase inducible nitric oxide synthase and superoxide, leading to peroxynitrite-driven acidic sphingomyelinase and ceramide. Ceramide is a major driver of MS pathophysiology via its impacts on glia mitochondria functioning; (2) Gut dysbiosis lowers production of the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate. Butyrate is a significant positive regulator of mitochondrial function, as well as suppressing the levels and effects of ceramide. Ceramide acts to suppress the circadian optimizers of mitochondria functioning, viz daytime orexin and night-time melatonin. Orexin, melatonin, and butyrate increase mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation partly via the disinhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, leading to an increase in acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA). Acetyl-CoA is a necessary co-substrate for activation of the mitochondria melatonergic pathway, allowing melatonin to optimize mitochondrial function. Data would indicate that gut-driven alterations in ceramide and mitochondrial function, particularly in glia and immune cells, underpin MS pathophysiology. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activators, such as stress-induced kynurenine and air pollutants, may interact with the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway via AhR-induced cytochrome P450 (CYP)1b1, which backward converts melatonin to N-acetylserotonin (NAS). The loss of mitochnodria melatonin coupled with increased NAS has implications for altered mitochondrial function in many cell types that are relevant to MS pathophysiology. NAS is increased in secondary progressive MS, indicating a role for changes in the mitochondria melatonergic pathway in the progression of MS symptomatology. This provides a framework for the integration of diverse bodies of data on MS pathophysiology, with a number of readily applicable treatment interventions, including the utilization of sodium butyrate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695470>Epigallocatechin-3-gallate suppresses neutrophil migration speed in a transgenic zebrafish model accompanied by reduced inflammatory mediators.</a></h2><p>Polyphenol catechins from green tea, particularly (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), exhibits numerous beneficial health effects, although the mechanisms remain unclear.In this study, the mechanism of EGCG-mediated healing in an experimentally injured zebrafish model was examined at the cellular and molecular level using confocal microscopy and gene expression analysis.The mechanisms of action of EGCG were shown to involve: (1) reducing neutrophil response (accumulation, travel speed, and distance) and (2) downregulating the expression of IL-1β, TNFα, and related signaling pathways. As determined by dynamic time-lapse tracking studies, the local accumulation of neutrophils with high migration speeds after wounding (n=33 cells, v=0.020 μm/s, d=37.8 μm), underwent significant reduction following treatment with EGCG doses of 300 μM (n=22 cells, v=0.013 μm/s, d=39.5 μm) and 600 μM (n=18 cells, v=0.008 μm/s, d=9.53 μm). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction studies revealed that several signature genes in the IL-1β, TNFα, and related signaling pathways were downregulated after EGCG treatment.The convenience, transparency, and simplicity of the zebrafish model facilitate tracking of fluorescent neutrophils in real time, in order to monitor , and assess the impact of therapeutic agents.© 2019 Nguyen et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691819>CAUSALdb: a database for disease/trait causal variants identified using summary statistics of genome-wide association studies.</a></h2><p>Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revolutionized the field of complex trait genetics over the past decade, yet for most of the significant genotype-phenotype associations the true causal variants remain unknown. Identifying and interpreting how causal genetic variants confer disease susceptibility is still a big challenge. Herein we introduce a new database, CAUSALdb, to integrate the most comprehensive GWAS summary statistics to date and identify credible sets of potential causal variants using uniformly processed fine-mapping.

Under physiological conditions, vascular  offers a template for the establishment of effective intravascular immunity, with platelets providing neutrophils with an array of signals that increase their activation threshold, thus limiting collateral damage to tissues and promoting termination of the inflammatory response. By contrast, persistent systemic  as observed in immune-mediated diseases, such as systemic vasculitides, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by platelet and neutrophil reciprocal activation, which ultimately culminates in the generation of thrombo-inflammatory lesions, fostering vascular injury and organ damage.

Since diet can impact fish immunity, this work investigated the effect of dietary supplementation of 5% Gracilaria sp. aqueous extract (GRA) on seabass antioxidant capacity and resistance against Phdp. After infection, mortality was delayed in fish fed GRA, which also revealed increased lysozyme activity levels, as well as decreased lipid peroxidation, suggesting higher antioxidant capacity than in fish fed a control diet. Dietary GRA induced a down-regulation of hepatic stress-responsive heat shock proteins (grp-78, grp-170, grp-94, grp-75), while bacterial infection caused a down-regulation in antioxidant genes (prdx4 and mn-sod). Diet and infection interaction down-regulated the transcription levels of genes associated with oxidative stress response (prdx5 and gpx4) in liver. In head-kidney, GRA led to an up-regulation of genes associated with  (il34, ccr9, cd33) and a down-regulation of genes related to cytokine signalling (mif, il1b, defb, a2m, myd88). Additionally, bacterial infection up-regulated immunoglobulins production (IgMs) and down-regulated the transcription of the antimicrobial peptide leap2 in head kidney.

However, the immunological response and therapeutic effects of visfatin under bacterial stress in murine lung tissue are still not clear. To investigate the role of visfatin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI), thirty Kunming mice were divided into Saline, LPS, and LPS + visfatin groups. After routine blood examination, the effects of visfatin on inflammatory cytokines, lung tissue structure, and expression of inflammatory mediators were explored through hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), Masson and immunohistochemical staining, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), and Western blotting. Compared with the Saline group, neutrophil percentage, peripheral blood neutrophil count, and the ratio of lymphocyte count (NLR) were upregulated in LPS group. Moreover, Masson staining showed alterations in lung tissue structure; the mRNA level of different cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-10, TLR4, IFN-γ) was upregulated; and the protein expression of interleukin (IL)-6, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β) was significantly (p < 0.05) different in LPS group. Compared with LPS group, neutrophil percentage significantly decreased (p < 0.01), the numbers of lymphocytes significantly (p < 0.05) increased, NLR decreased, Masson staining of the lung was extremely different (p < 0.01), the structure of the lung was slightly damaged, and the myeloperoxidase values of lung showed no differences in LPS + visfatin. Hence, visfatin inhibits the lung  induced by ALI. During the ALI, visfatin acts by decreasing NLR, downregulated the expression of MPO, enhanced antioxidant capacity, and regulated the inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α to reduce the lung injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692453>Baicalein attenuates OVA-induced allergic airway  through the inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Asthma is a type of chronic lung  with restrictions in effective therapy. NF-κB pathway activation has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Baicalein, one of the major active flavonoids found in , exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting NF-κB activity. Herein, we report that Baicalein significantly reduces OVA-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), airway , serum IgE levels, mucus production, and collagen deposition around the airway. Additionally, western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assay showed that Baicalein attenuates the activation of NF-κB, which was mainly reflected by IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, p65 nuclear translocation and downstream iNOS expression. Furthermore, in human epithelial cells, Baicalein blocked TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. Our study provides evidence that Baicalein administration alleviates the pathological changes in asthma through inactivating the NF-κB/iNOS pathway.

The major protease responsible for this cleavage is the membrane metalloprotease ADAM17, which also has been implicated in cleavage of TNFα and interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor. It has been recently shown that in the absence of ADAM17, the main protease for EGF-R ligand processing, colon cancer formation is largely abrogated. Intriguingly, colon cancer formation depends on EGF-R activity on myeloid cells rather than on intestinal epithelial cells. A major activity of EGF-R on myeloid cells is the stimulation of IL-6 synthesis. Subsequently, IL-6 together with the ADAM17 shed soluble IL-6 receptor acts on intestinal epithelial cells via IL-6 trans-signaling to induce colon cancer formation, which can be blocked by the inhibitor of IL-6 trans-signaling, sgp130Fc. Blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling therefore offers a new therapeutic window downstream of the EGF-R for the treatment of colon cancer and possibly of other EGF-R related neoplastic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692724>Cytokines trigger disruption of endothelium barrier function and p38 MAP kinase activation in -silenced human lung microvascular endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>The bone morphogenetic protein receptor II (BMPRII) signaling pathway is impaired in pulmonary arterial hypertension and mutations in the  gene have been observed in both heritable and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Circulating levels and/or lung tissue expression of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin-18 are elevated in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and could be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension. We consequently hypothesized that cytokines could trigger endothelial dysfunction in addition to impaired BMPRII signaling. Our aim was to determine whether impairment of BMPRII signaling might affect endothelium barrier function and adhesiveness to monocytes, in response to cytokines.  was silenced in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) using lentiviral vectors encoding microRNA-based hairpins. Effects of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-18 on HLMVEC adhesiveness to the human monocyte cell line THP-1, adhesion molecule expression, endothelial barrier function and activation of P38MAPK were investigated in vitro. Stable  silencing in HLMVECs resulted in impaired endothelial barrier function and constitutive activation of P38MAPK. Adhesiveness of -silenced HLMVECs to THP-1 cells was enhanced by tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-18 through ICAM-1 adhesion molecule. Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor-α induced activation of P38MAPK and disrupted endothelial barrier function in -silenced HLMVECs. Altogether, our findings showed that stable  silencing resulted in impaired endothelial barrier function and activation of P38MAPK in HLMVECs. In -silenced HLMVECs, cytokines enhanced adhesiveness capacities, activation of P38MAPK and impaired endothelial barrier function suggesting that cytokines could trigger the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension in a context of impaired BMPRII signaling pathway.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696556>MiR-125b but not miR-125a is upregulated and exhibits a trend to correlate with enhanced disease severity, , and increased mortality in sepsis patients.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate the correlation of miR-125a/b expressions with disease risk, progression, and prognosis of sepsis.MiR-125a/b expressions and inflammatory cytokines were detected by RT-qPCR and ELISA assays in plasma samples from 120 sepsis patients.

Most interestingly, miR-125b was greatly decreased in survivors compared with non-survivors, and multivariate analysis revealed that miR-125b independently predicted higher mortality risk in sepsis patients. Besides, miR-125a showed no significant correlation with sepsis risk, disease severity, or prognosis.MiR-125b but not miR-125a is upregulated and exhibits a trend to correlate with enhanced disease severity, , and increased mortality in sepsis patients.© 2019 The Authors.

The mdx mouse, also dystrophin deficient, is the model most widely used to study the pathology and test potential therapies, but the phenotype is milder than human DMD. This limits the magnitude and range of histological damage parameters and molecular changes that can be measured in pre-clinical drug testing. We used three weeks of voluntary wheel running to exacerbate the mdx phenotype. In mdx mice voluntary exercise increased the amount of damaged necrotic tissue and macrophage infiltration. Global gene expression profiling revealed that exercise induced additional and larger gene expression changes in mdx mice and the pathways most impacted by exercise were all related to immune function or cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. When we compared the matrisome and  genes that were dysregulated in mdx with those commonly differentially expressed in DMD, we found the exercised mdx molecular signature more closely resembled that of DMD. These gene expression changes in the exercised mdx model thus provide more scope to assess the effects of pre-clinical treatments. Our gene profiling comparisons also highlighted upregulation of extracellular matrix proteins involved in innate immunity pathways, proteases that can release them, and downstream receptors and signalling molecules in exercised mdx and DMD, suggesting that the ECM could be a major source of pro-inflammatory molecules that trigger and maintain the immune response in dystrophic muscle.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here, we characterized global gene expression in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Arc) in diet-induced obese (DIO) rats following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). 60 days post-RYGB, the Arc was isolated by laser-capture microdissection and global gene expression was assessed by RNA sequencing. RYGB lowered body weight and adiposity as compared to sham-operated DIO rats. Discrete transcriptome changes were observed in the Arc following RYGB, including differential expression of genes associated with  and neuropeptide signaling. RYGB reduced gene expression of glial cell markers, including Gfap, Aif1 and Timp1, confirmed by a lower number of GFAP immunopositive astrocyte profiles in the Arc. Sham-operated weight-matched rats demonstrated a similar glial gene expression signature, suggesting that RYGB and dietary restriction have common effects on hypothalamic gliosis. Considering that RYGB surgery also led to increased orexigenic and decreased anorexigenic gene expression, this may signify increased hunger-associated signaling at the level of the Arc. Hence, induction of counterregulatory molecular mechanisms downstream from the Arc may play an important role in RYGB-induced weight loss.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692081>Biofilm producing Staphylococcus epidermidis (RP62A strain) inhibits osseous integration without osteolysis and histopathology in a murine septic implant model.</a></h2><p>Despite its presence in orthopaedic infections, Staphylococcus epidermidis's ability to directly induce  and bone destruction is unknown. Thus, we compared a clinical strain of methicillin-resistant biofilm-producing Staphylococcus epidermidis (RP62A) to a highly virulent and osteolytic strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (USA300) in an established murine implant-associated osteomyelitis model. Bacterial burden was assessed by colony forming units (CFUs), tissue damage was assessed by histology and micro-computer tomography (µCT), biofilm was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), host gene expression was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and osseous integration was assessed via biomechanical push-out test. While CFUs were recovered from RP62A contaminated implants and surrounding tissues after 14 days, the bacterial burden was significantly less than USA300-infected tibiae (p<0.001). Additionally, RP62A failed to produce any of the gross pathologies induced by USA300 (osteolysis, reactive bone-formation, Staphylococcus abscess communities, marrow necrosis and biofilm). However, fibrous tissue was present at the implant-host interface, and rigorous SEM confirmed the rare presence of cocci on RP62A-contaminated implants. Gene expression studies revealed that IL-1β, IL-6, RANKL, and TLR-2 mRNA levels in RP62A infected bone were increased versus Sterile controls. Ex vivo push-out testing showed RP62A infected implants required significantly less force compared to the Sterile group (7.5±3.4 N vs. 17.3±4.1 N; p<0.001), but required 10-fold greater force than USA300 infected implants (0.7±0.3 N; p<0.001). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that S. epidermidis is a commensal pathogen whose mechanisms to inhibit osseous integration are limited to minimal biofilm formation on the implant, and low-grade .

It may be an underdiagnosed condition in adults because it resembles acute pyelonephritis (APN) in its clinical presentation.Two young women (25 and 27 years old, respectively) presented with complaints compatible with a diagnosis of APN. However in both, fever was of high grade, persistent for several days in spite of antibiotic administration, and there was demonstrated worsening of the inflammatory biomarkers. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) led to the diagnosis in both cases.Contrast-enhanced computed tomography reveals the most sensitive and specific images of AFBN. This includes wedge-shaped lesions with decreased enhancement, which may be focal or multifocal.Antibiotic therapy for at least 3 weeks.Resolution of AFBN was obtained after 3 weeks of antibiotics.Our 2 cases illustrate the importance of CECT imaging to confirm the diagnosis of AFBN. Interstitial bacterial  may have a worse prognosis if not diagnosed early and efficiently treated. Unlike APN, the management of AFBN requires at least 3 weeks of antibiotics to prevent the development of renal scarring and renal abscess.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691749>Evaluation of Serum Levels of , Fibrinolysis and Oxidative Stress Markers in Coronary Artery Disease Prediction: A Cross-Sectional Study.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694631>Effect of injected dexamethasone on relative cytokine mRNA expression in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in horses with mild asthma.</a></h2><p>Mild equine asthma is a common inflammatory airway disease of the horse. The primary treatment of mild equine asthma is corticosteroids. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of injected dexamethasone on relative IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p35, IL-17, IL-23, IFN-γ, Eotaxin-2 and TNF-α mRNA expression in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in healthy Thoroughbred horses (n = 6), and those with mild equine asthma (n = 7).Horses with mild equine asthma had a significantly greater bronchoalveolar lavage mast cell percentage than healthy horses both before and after treatment. Mild equine asthma was associated with a 4.95-fold up-regulation of IL-17 (p = 0.026) and a 2.54-fold down-regulation of IL-10 (p = 0.049) compared to healthy horses. TNF-α was down-regulated in response to dexamethasone treatment in both healthy horses (3.03-fold, p = 0.023) and those with mild equine asthma (1.75-fold, p = 0.023). IL-5 was also down-regulated in horses with mild asthma (2.17-fold, p = 0.048).Horses with mild equine asthma have a lower concentration of IL-10 in BAL fluid than healthy controls which concurs with human asthmatics. The marked up-regulation of IL-17 in horses with mild asthma suggests these horses had a true tendency of "allergic" airway  in response to environmental allergens. Dexamethasone administration exerted anti-inflammatory effects associated with down-regulation of TNF-α in all horses, and decreased levels of IL-5 mRNA expression in horses with mild equine asthma.

Andrographolide (AG), the main active component of the herb Andrographis paniculata, has been used for many years for anti-inflammatory and antibacterial infections. AG has an antibacterial effect on a wide variety of bacteria, which is reflected in the inhibition of bacterial pathogenic factors and the regulation of immunity to downregulate infectious  caused by bacteria.

Animals were divided into four groups, each composed of seven cows, depending on the i.u. preparation used: Group A, cefapirin; Group B, methisoprinol; Group C, cefapirin and methisoprinol simultaneously; and a control group-without medication. The study was performed using flow cytometry method. Summarizing the results of the research, i.u. infusion of cefapirin caused a weakening of the effector phase of the local uterine immune response; however, it enhanced leukocyte chemotaxis and antigen presentation. After i.u. administration of methisoprinol, the stimulation of specific uterine immunity mechanisms was mainly observed. The use of both mentioned preparations showed the strengthening of specific uterine immunological mechanisms presumably caused by methisoprinol, despite the inhibitory effect of the antibiotic. Intrauterine use of immunostimulatory substances can improve the effectiveness of the endometritis treatment in cows by improving specific local mechanisms of uterine immunity. As a consequence, it may enhance the effector function of immune competent cells and finally eliminate .© 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694553>Postoperative cognitive dysfunction after robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with cerebral oxygen monitoring an observational prospective cohort pilot study.</a></h2><p>The incidence and risk factors of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) during robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) in extreme Trendelenburg positioning and pneumoperitoneum are still controversial. The aim of this prospective observational study was to find the incidence rate as well as possible risk factors of POCD in RARC with cerebral oxygen monitoring.Patients who underwent RARC and open abdominal surgery in horizontal positioning were included. Preoperative and postoperative arterial blood gas (ABG), S-100β, C-reactive protein (CRP), and cognitive dysfunction scales were tested. Also, we used Z score to analyze and comprehensively evaluate POCD. Measurements of heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), end-tidal CO (etCO), and cerebral oxygen were immediately obtained after different time points during the surgery.Here, 24 and 23 patients were included in the RARC group and in the control group, respectively. The incidence of POCD didn't have significant difference in RARC group (45.8%), in contrast to the control group (26.1%). The laboratory tests of s100β and CRP between two groups didn't contain significant difference as well. As duration of Trendelenburg and pneumoperitoneum prolonged, the cerebral oxygen saturation in the RARC group increased, which didn't cause excessive perfusion nevertheless (rSO<75%). We compared laboratory tests, age, education status, blood loss, and fluid input between POCD and non-POCD patients. A significant difference was found in the serum concentrations of CRP (72.59 ± 42.09 vs. 48.50 ± 26.53, P = 0.025) and age (69.20 ± 7.033 vs. 65.34 ± 5.228, P = 0.041).RARC in extreme Trendelenburg positioning and pneumoperitoneum did not significantly increase the incidence of POCD and didn't cause excessive perfusion.

Although the inner ear was once believed to be "immune-privileged," recent studies have shown that macrophages are distributed in the cochlea and may play important roles in the immune system thereof. Resident macrophages have heterogeneous origins among tissues and throughout developmental stages. However, the origins of embryonic cochlear macrophages remain unknown. Here, we show that the early development of resident macrophages in the mouse cochlea depends on yolk sac hematopoiesis. Accordingly, our results found that macrophages emerging around the developing otocyst at E10.5 exhibited dynamic changes in distribution and  proliferative capacity during embryonic and neonatal stages. Cochlear examination in -null mice revealed a substantial decrease in the number of Iba1-positive macrophages in the spiral ganglion and spiral ligament, whereas they were still observed in the cochlear mesenchyme or on the intraluminal surface of the perilymphatic space. Our results demonstrated that two subtypes of resident macrophages are present in the embryonic cochlea, one being Csf1r-dependent macrophages that originate from the yolk sac and the other being Csf1r-independent macrophages that appear to be derived from the fetal liver via systemic circulation. We consider the present study to be a starting point for elucidating the roles of embryonic cochlear resident macrophages. Furthermore, resident macrophages in the embryonic cochlea could be a novel target for the treatment of various inner ear disorders.Copyright © 2019 Kishimoto, Okano, Nishimura, Motohashi and Omori.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696340>The synergistic effect between adult weight changes and CYP24A1 polymorphisms is associated with pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer risk.</a></h2><p>Vitamin D (VD) metabolism regulates adipose tissue, lipogenesis , and tumor growth. CYP24A1 is the key enzyme for metabolic inactivation of active VD (1,25(OH)D). We examined whether common germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CYP24A1 gene could affect the association between adult weight gain and breast cancer (BC) risk.The population-based case-control study included 818 patients with primary BC and 935 residence and age matched healthy controls. We studied the relationships between CYP24A1 gene SNPs (rs2209314, rs2585428, rs2762941, rs3787555, rs4809959, rs73913757, rs912505, and rs927a650), adult weight change and BC risk. Gene-weight change interactions were analyzed.Neither of CYP24A1 gene SNPs was associated with BC risk in the study participants. However, we found consistent gene-weight interactions with increasing adult weight gain for CYP24A1-rs2762941 (P-interaction = 0.0089) and CYP24A1-rs927650 (P-interaction = 0.0283). Adult weight gain has a higher premenopausal BC risk with double variant T alleles of rs927650 compared to women carrying at least one wild-type C allele (OR for TT = 1.82, 95% CI 1.10-3.01; for CT = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76-1.14; for CC = 1.12 95% CI 0.93-1.35). Women with double wild-type A alleles were at a higher postmenopausal BC risk compared to those carrying at least one variant-type G allele (OR for AA = 1.51, 95% CI 1.29-1.76; for AG = 1.13, 95% CI 0.98-1.30; for GG = 1.22 95% CI 0.95-1.57). When stratified by CYP24A1 SNPs genotypes, weight gain in adulthood increased postmenopausal BC risk of women with homozygous allele compared to women with heterozygotes allele.Significant interactions of weight change with CYP24A1 polymorphisms suggest CYP24A1 as a potential link between weight change and BC risk and the possibility that the impact of adult weight gain on postmenopausal BC risk may be enhanced by homozygous alleles of CYP24A1 SNPs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692536>Inhibition of the hedgehog pathway for the treatment of cancer using Itraconazole.</a></h2><p>Itraconazole (ITZ) is an anti-fungal drug that has been used in clinical practice for nearly 35 years. Recently, numerous experiments have shown that ITZ possesses anti-cancer properties. The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway plays a pivotal role in fundamental processes, including embryogenesis, structure, morphology and proliferation in various species. This pathway is typically silent in adult cells, and inappropriate activity is linked to various tumor types. The most important mechanism of ITZ in the treatment of cancer is inhibition of the Hh pathway through the inhibition of smoothened receptors (SMO), glioma-associated oncogene homologs (GLI), and their downstream targets. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of ITZ in the treatment of cancer through inhibition of the Hh pathway, which includes anti-, prevention of tumor growth, induction of cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and autophagy, prevention of angiogenesis, and drug resistance. We also discuss the clinical use of ITZ in many types of cancers. We hope this review will provide more information to support future studies on ITZ in the treatment of various cancers.© 2019 Li et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695700>NKT-Like (CD3+CD56+) Cells in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Patients Treated With Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Therapy with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI) aiming stable deep molecular response is the gold standard to treat Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). NKT-like cells (CD3CD56) combine characteristics of T and NK cells. The physiopathological role of these cells remains unknown although the literature refers their association with , autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Since the information regarding the role of NKT-like cells in CML is rare, we aimed at the characterization of these cells in CML patients treated with TKIs. Peripheral blood NKT-like cells from 48 CML patients and 40 healthy donors were analyzed by multiparametric flow cytometry. Functional tests consisting of co-culture with leukemic target cells (K562 cell line) were used to measure degranulation and cytokine production. Our results revealed that NKT-like cells are decreased in treated CML patients, although they present increased expression of activation markers (CD69 and HLA-DR), increased degranulation (CD107a) and impaired IFN-γ production. Significantly alterations on the expression of tumor recognition (NCRs and NKp80), and immune regulation receptors (LAG-3, TIM-3, and CD137) by NKT-like cells were observed in CML patients. Second generation TKIs increased cell activation (CD69) and decreased expression of NKp44 and NKp80 by NKT-like cells from CML patients when compared to Imatinib. CML patients that achieved deep molecular response (MR4.5) presented downregulation of NKp44 and LAG-3.

Adipose tissue is considered one of the largest endocrine organs in the body as well as an active tissue for cellular reactions and metabolic homeostasis rather than an inert tissue only for energy storage. The functional pleiotropism of adipose tissue relies on its ability to synthesize and release a large number of hormones, cytokines, extracellular matrix proteins, and growth and vasoactive factors, which are collectively called adipokines known to influence a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. In the obese state, excessive visceral fat accumulation causes adipose tissue dysfunctionality that strongly contributes to the onset of obesity-related comorbidities. The mechanisms underlying adipose tissue dysfunction include adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia, increased , impaired extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis together with an altered secretion of adipokines.

The dietary choice should be individualized, however, the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines recommend an ED for pediatric EoE with multiple food allergies, failure to thrive, unresponsive disease or unable to follow a highly restricted diet. The aim of this narrative review was to explore the effectiveness of the ED (using amino acid formula [AAF]), in the management of pediatric EoE.Literature searches were performed to identify eligible studies that described outcomes including eosinophil count, clinical symptoms, growth, and medications.Overall, 10 eligible studies were found, with n = 462 patients assigned to receive AAF from a total of n = 748 (average age 6.7 years), for a duration of 4 to 8 weeks. The use of AAF reduced eosinophil levels and demonstrated remission (defined as ≤10 eosinophils per high power field) in 75%-100% of children with improvements, if not resolution, in clinical symptoms. AAF was more clinically effective than the use of the EED or TED, where remission rates were 75%-81% and 40%-69%, respectively. Few studies collected growth outcomes, however where documented these were positive for those on AAF. The long-term impacts of each diet were not thoroughly explored.The use of AAF is a clinically effective management option for pediatric EoE, and further research is required to guide long-term management.© 2019 The Authors.

Elevated levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) have been identified in cerebrospinal fluid of living AD patients and in animal models of AD. Increased expression of IL-1β and iron accumulation have been identified in microglial cells that cluster around amyloid plaques in AD mouse models and post-mortem brain tissues of AD patients. The goals of this study were to determine the effects of Aβ on the secretion of IL-1β by microglial cells and whether iron status influences this pro-inflammatory signaling cue. Immortalized microglial (IMG) cells were incubated with Aβ with or without iron. qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses showed that Aβ induces biosynthesis of IL-1β by IMG cells. IMG cells secrete the mature form of IL-1β in a caspase-1 dependent manner. Incubation with iron provoked a greater pro-inflammatory response. Inhibition of the iron transporter DMT1 protected IMG cells against Aβ-induced . Potentiation of Aβ-elicited IL-1β induction by iron was also antagonized by ROS inhibitors, supporting the model that DMT1-mediated iron loading and subsequent increase in ROS contribute to the inflammatory effects of Aβ in microglia. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy indicate that iron enhances Aβ activation of NF-κB signaling to promote IL-1β synthesis. These results support the hypothesis that Aβ stimulates IL-1β expression by activating NF-κB signaling in microglia cells. Most importantly, iron appears to exacerbate the pro-inflammatory effects of Aβ to increase IL-1β levels.© 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692443>Common Pathological Mechanisms and Risk Factors for Alzheimer's Disease and Type-2 Diabetes: Focus on .</a></h2><p>Diabetes is considered as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, but it is yet un-clear whether this pathological link is reciprocal. Although Alzheimer's disease and diabetes appear as entirely different pathological entities affecting the central nervous system and a peripheral organ (pan-creas), respectively, they share a common pathological core. Recent evidence suggests that in the pancreas in the case of diabetes, as in the brain for Alzheimer's disease, the initial pathological event may be the accumulation of toxic proteins yielding amyloidosis. Moreover, in both pathologies, amyloidosis is likely responsible for local , which acts as a driving force for cell death and tissue degeneration. These pathological events are all inter-connected and establish a vicious cycle resulting in the progressive character of both pathologies.To address the literature supporting the hypothesis of a common pathological core for both diseases.We will focus on the obvious differences between the disease-related inflammatory changes in a peripheral organ, such as the pancreas, versus those observed in the brain.

Myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2) has been reported to play a pivotal role in the recognition of LPS and LPS-mediates inflammatory response. There have been no clinically effective therapeutic drugs for ALI. L6H9, an inhibitor of MD2, showed anti-inflammatory effects and cardiac protective activity. However, its effect on ALI has not been elucidated. In this study, intratracheal instillation of LPS was employed to induce ALI in rats. L6H9 pretreatment attenuates LPS-induced pathological variations in lung tissue and pulmonary edema. LPS instillation enhanced lung microvascular permeability, thereby causing inflammatory cells flow into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). However, L6H9 inhibited the LPS-induced upregulation of total protein concentration and the number of inflammatory cells in BALF. In the meantime, macrophages infiltration in lung tissue induced by LPS was also mitigated by L6H9 treatment. Furthermore, L6H9 suppressed LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines expression in BALF, serum, and lung tissue. It is noteworthy that LPS-induced MD2/TLR4 complex formation was inhibited by L6H9 in lung tissue. On the whole, these results show that L6H9 can attenuate LPS-induced ALI in vivo by targeting MD2.

Nitric oxide (NO) is one of these small molecule regulators and its function has already been associated with  and angiogenesis during adult healing.Our results showed that NO is also an essential component during embryonic scarless healing and acts via a previously unknown mechanism. NO is mainly produced during the early phase of healing and it is crucial for the expression of genes associated with healing. However, we also observed a late phase of healing, which occurs for several hours after wound closure and takes place under the epidermis and includes tissue remodelling that is dependent on NO. We also found that the NO is associated with multiple cellular metabolic pathways, in particularly the glucose metabolism pathway. This is particular noteworthy as the use of NO donors have already been found to be beneficial for the treatment of chronic healing defects (including those associated with diabetes) and it is possible that its mechanism of action follows those observed during embryonic wound healing.Our study describes a new role of NO during healing, which may potentially translate to improved therapeutic treatments, especially for individual suffering with problematic healing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696427>An overview of research trends and genetic polymorphisms for noise-induced hearing loss from 2009 to 2018.</a></h2><p>Recently, there has been increased studies in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). We aimed to make an overview of research trends and genetic polymorphisms for NIHL from 2009 to 2018 with VOSviewer software. A total of 2391 papers were identified for research trends analysis in NIHL and 33 studies identified for a brief review of genetic polymorphisms in human NIHL. The number of publications has been increasing over the past decade. The journal Hearing Research published the most articles (218). The USA contributed the largest number of papers (1042; 43.58%), with the most citations (18,987) and the highest H-index (60). The University of Washington was the most contributive institution. Liberman MC published the most articles (32), and Kujawa SG possessed the highest co-citations (584). Except for high-frequency keywords identified by the software, "prevalence," "oxidative stress," "hair cells," and "cochlear implant" were also the latest research frontiers.

At presentation, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/60 in the right eye. Slit lamp examination demonstrated severe corneal stromal edema with Descemet's folds and conjunctival hyperemia. We prescribed topical prednisolone acetate 1% eye drops (8 times a day), cyclosporine 0.1% (once a day) and oral prednisolone (30 mg a day for 3 days). One day later, the BCVA improved to20/40 and marked improvement in corneal edema was observed. At 5 days, BCVA was 20/22 and anterior segment examination showed minimal corneal edema with resolution of Descemet's folds. At 2 weeks, BCVA was 20/20 in the right eye and corneal edema completely resolved.This case suggests that high index of suspicion for toxicity from Asclepias species is necessary when encountered with patients who present with corneal edema after exposure to these plants. Aggressive anti-inflammatory treatment might be helpful for early recovery, at least for young patients.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694226>Synergistic Cytoprotective Effects of Rutin and Ascorbic Acid on the Proteomic Profile of 3D-Cultured Keratinocytes Exposed to UVA or UVB Radiation.</a></h2><p>The combination of ascorbic acid and rutin, often used in oral preparations, due to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, can be used to protect skin cells against the effects of UV radiation from sunlight. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the synergistic effect of rutin and ascorbic acid on the proteomic profile of UVA and UVB irradiated keratinocytes cultured in a three-dimensional (3D) system. Results showed that the combination of rutin and ascorbic acid protects skin cells against UV-induced changes. In particular, alterations were observed in the expression of proteins involved in the antioxidant response, DNA repairing, , apoptosis, and protein biosynthesis. The combination of rutin and ascorbic acid also showed a stronger cytoprotective effect than when using either compound alone. Significant differences were visible between rutin and ascorbic acid single treatments in the case of protein carboxymethylation/carboxyethylation. Ascorbic acid prevented UV or rutin-induced protein modifications. Therefore, the synergistic effect of rutin and ascorbic acid creates a potentially effective protective system against skin damages caused by UVA and UVB radiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693788>The development and outcome of acute-on-chronic liver failure after surgical interventions.</a></h2><p>Acute-on-Chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a syndrome with high short-term mortality. Precipitating events including hemorrhage and infections contribute to ACLF development, but the role of surgery remains unknown. This analysis investigated development of ACLF in patients with cirrhosis undergoing surgery.369 patients with cirrhosis were included in the study. The clinical and laboratory data were collected prior to and on days 1-2, 3-8 and 9-28, at three and 12 months after surgery. Surgery type was classified as limited or extensive, as well as liver and non-liver surgery.A total of 39 patients had baseline ACLF. Surgery was performed during acute decompensation (AD) in 35% of the rest 330 patients and eighty-one (24.5%) developed ACLF within 28 days after surgery. Surrogate markers of systemic  were similar in patients who developed ACLF or not. Age, sex, serum sodium, baseline bacterial infection and abdominal non-liver surgery were independent predictors for the development of ACLF after surgery. Patients who developed ACLF within 28 days after surgery had a higher mortality at 3, 6 and 12 months. Survival did not differ between patients with ACLF at surgery and those developing ACLF after surgery. Development of ACLF within 28 days after surgery, elevated alkaline phosphatase and INR were independent predictors of 90-day mortality. Independent predictors of one-year all-cause mortality were alkaline phosphatase, MELD score and pre-operative hepatic encephalopathy, while non-liver surgery was associated with improved survival.ACLF frequently develops in cirrhotic patients undergoing surgery, especially in those with active bacterial infection, lower serum sodium and kidney or coagulation dysfunction. Prognoses of ACLF both at and after surgery are similarly poor. Cirrhotic patients should be carefully managed perioperatively.Copyright © 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692938>Investigating the lowest threshold of vascular benefits from LDL cholesterol lowering with a PCSK9 mAb inhibitor (alirocumab) in healthy volunteers - a mechanistic physiological study (INTENSITY-LOW): protocol and study rationale.</a></h2><p> Whether reducing low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is associated with cardiovascular benefits in low risk normocholesterolaemic subjects is unknown. The INTENSITY LOW [Investigating the lowest threshold of vascular benefits from LDL-cholesterol lowering with a PCSK9 mAb inhibitor (alirocumab) in healthy volunteers] study aims to assess whether lowering LDL-C by alirocumab monotherapy can improve endothelial-dependent vascular function compared with placebo (primary objective) in low-risk normocholesterolaemic healthy individuals. Changes in endothelial-dependent or endothelial-independent vascular function, arterial stiffness and biomarkers of systemic  by alirocumab, atorvastatin or their combination are secondary objectives.  This is a single-center, randomized, two-period, single-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (N03273972). It will include 30 healthy low-risk subjects with LDL-C < 4.1 mmol/l. After passing the screening visit (Visit 1), eligible participants will be randomized 1:1 to either subcutaneous alirocumab 150 mg or placebo. These will be administered as single doses in 2 visits 14 days apart (Visits 2 and 3). Atorvastatin 20 mg once nightly will be prescribed for 14 days at Visit 3 in both groups through to Visit 4. At baseline (Visit 2) and during all post-dose visits (Visits 3-4), endothelial function will be assessed using venous occlusion plethysmography. Specifically, changes in forearm blood flow responses to intra-arterial infusions of acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside and L-N-monomethyl-arginine acetate will be assessed as surrogates of endothelial-dependent and -independent vasodilatation. Additionally, arterial stiffness and carotid intima-media thickness will be evaluated at the same timepoints.

Macrophages, which recognize microbial infections through identification of bacterial markers such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), are crucial to the pathogenesis of sepsis-associated liver injury. However, the understanding of the SPIONs-mediated modulation of macrophage responses in LPS-induced sepsis and liver injury is limited.Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) of γ-FeO nanoparticles were prepared, and their morphology and magnetic properties were characterized.Using a murine model of LPS-induced sepsis and liver injury, we found that SPIONs alleviated LPS-induced sepsis, preventing infiltration of inflammatory cells into the liver. SPIONs also increased the level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in liver macrophages, while SPIONs's effect on LPS-induced sepsis was abrogated in  mice, indicating that the protective effect of SPIONs is dependent on IL-10 macrophages. Moreover, SPIONs activated macrophage autophagy to increase IL-10 production, which was markedly attenuated by autophagy inhibition. Furthermore, SPIONs upregulated the expression of Caveolin-1 (Cav1) in macrophages, which plays a role in cellular uptake of metallic nanoparticles. Interestingly, activation of Cav1 and Notch1/HES1 signaling was involved in SPIONs-induced autophagy in both RAW 264.7 cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Our data reveal a novel mechanism for SPIONs -induced autophagy in macrophages, which occurs through activation of the Cav1-Notch1/HES1 signaling pathway, which promotes the production of IL-10 in macrophages, leading to inhibition of  in LPS-induced sepsis and liver injury.Our results suggest that SPIONs may represent a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of sepsis and sepsis-induced liver injury.© 2019 Xu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694192>The Role of Inflammasome-Dependent and Inflammasome-Independent NLRP3 in the Kidney.</a></h2><p>Cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) forms an inflammasome with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) and pro-caspase-1, which is followed by the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 to active caspase-1 and ultimately the activation of IL-1β and IL-18 and induction of pyroptosis in immune cells. NLRP3 activation in kidney diseases aggravates  and subsequent fibrosis, and this effect is abrogated by genetic or pharmacologic deletion of NLRP3. Inflammasome-dependent NLRP3 mediates the progression of kidney diseases by escalating the inflammatory response in immune cells and the cross-talk between immune cells and renal nonimmune cells. However, recent studies have suggested that NLRP3 has several inflammasome-independent functions in the kidney. Inflammasome-independent NLRP3 regulates apoptosis in tubular epithelial cells by interacting with mitochondria and mediating mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and mitophagy. This review will summarize the mechanisms by which NLRP3 functions in the kidney in both inflammasome-dependent and inflammasome-independent ways and the role of NLRP3 and NLRP3 inhibitors in kidney diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691489> in myocardial disease: From myocarditis to dilated cardiomyopathy.</a></h2><p>Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heterogeneous group of myocardial diseases clinically defined by the presence of left ventricular dilatation and contractile dysfunction.

The small sample produced, however, may be inadequate for diagnostic and prognostic analyses due to mechanical artefacts, insufficient material, or sampling errors. Small case series have demonstrated choroidal biopsy via vitrectomy to be safe and effective. With smaller-gauge vitrectomy instruments, visual recovery is rapid, and post-operative  and conjunctival scarring is minimised. Furthermore, smaller-gauge instrumentation does not appear to affect the diagnostic yield of biopsies for intraocular lymphoma in vitro. We report a case of primary choroidal lymphoma successfully diagnosed with 27-gauge pars plana vitrectomy choroidal biopsy.A 72-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of painless blurred vision in her right eye. Fundus examination revealed a large pale choroidal mass centred on the posterior pole with overlying exudative retinal detachment. Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography revealed a markedly thickened choroid with an undulating appearance. B-scan ultrasonography demonstrated diffuse, smooth thickening of the choroid, and retrobulbar extrascleral hypoechoic nodules. A 27-gauge pars plana vitrectomy was performed and choroidal biopsy taken. Histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and flow cytometry studies confirmed a diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. Systemic workup found no evidence of systemic lymphoma.

Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to detect the levels of miR-100, toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Moreover, proteins expressions of I-κB and induced-nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and apoptosis-related genes were measured by Western blotting. In addition, SCI model was established in rats. Expressions of inflammatory factors in SCI rats were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. Expression levels of TLR4/NF-κB pathway and miR-100 were determined by qRT-PCR. Immunofluorescence was conducted to measure activated microglia. Hindlimbs motor function in SCI rats was estimated via BBB 21-point rating scale.In activated microglia, miR-100 level decreased, while TLR4 and NF-κB levels increased. The protein level of I-κB decreased and iNOS increased. Transfection of miR-100 mimics reversed the above trends. Inflammatory factors were highly elevated in SCI rats and mRNA levels of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway and miR-100 were down-regulated, which were ameliorated in SCI rats overexpressing miR-100 in vivo. The amount of activated microglia was declined with the administration of miR-100 mimics compared with the untreated SCI rats. Furthermore, apoptosis-related proteins were down-regulated by miR-100 mimics injection.

Considering the rise of DES occurrence - the tendency anticipated to continue - as well as expansion of indications for installation of tear duct occluders, their usage can be expected to rise. The article describes a relatively rare clinical case that involved intracanalicular migration of silicone punctal plug. A female patient of 36 years old sought medical help in Research Institute of Eye Diseases (Moscow) to treat a lump in the area of lower lacrimal punctum in the left eye that was growing in size; the lump had appeared around 2 months prior to the visit. Patient's medical history read that around 2 years ago she had a silicone occluder installed in the lower lacrimal punctum of the left eye. On examination, in the area of lower lacrimal punctum, a body with a nutrient vascular pedicle deriving from lower lacrimal duct could be found. The occluder was absent in the opening of the lacrimal punctum. A revision of lower tear duct cavity was performed to remove its contents. The body filling tear duct opening was removed with forceps. Substance was then sent for histological examination. Tear duct was scraped out, the silicone occluder removed and sent to laboratory for scanning electron microscopy. The patient had no complaints 6 months after the procedure. CONCLUSION: The study showed that the forming body was granuloma resulting from aseptic .

CCK8, transwell assays, flow cytometry were conducted to detect the proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of target proteins. Multivariate analyses were conducted to analysis associates between clinicopathological values and survival.We found that levels of iNOS mRNA and protein were dramatically increased in ICC samples and positively correlated with complicated bile duct stone, differentiation, pathology T, pathology M, Wip1, MMP-2, and MMP-9. iNOS expression was significantly correlated with the poor survival of ICC patients. Furthermore, iNOS was high expression in ICC cell lines (QBC-939, ICC-9810, SSP-25) compare with human normal biliary epithelium cell line (HIBEpic); both iNOS knockdown and iNOS inhibitor (1400 W) suppressed cell proliferation, invasion, and migration though nitric oxide production in ICC cells. Down-regulation of iNOS also induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and ICC cell apoptosis. Moreover, iNOS knockdown treatment significantly decreased Wip1, MMP-9, and MMP-2 gene expression.Lowly expressed iNOS-inhibited proliferation yet promoted apoptosis of ICC cells.

SLE most often affects women (9:1) in childbearing age. The multifactorial nature of the etiopathogenesis of SLE involves a deficient clearance of dead and dying cells. This is supported by the occurrence of autoantibodies directed against autoantigens modified in dying and dead cells (dsDNA, high mobility group box 1 protein, apoptosis-associated chromatin modifications, e.g., histones H3-K27-me3; H2A/H4 AcK8,12,16; and H2B-AcK12) that are deposited in various tissues, including skin, kidneys, joints, muscles, and brain. The subsequent hyperinflammatory response often leads to irreparable tissue damage and organ destruction. In healthy individuals, dead and dying cells are rapidly removed by macrophages in an anti-inflammatory manner, referred to as efferocytosis. In SLE, extensive and prolonged cell death (apoptosis, necrosis, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation) leads to autoantigens leaking out of the not cleared cell debris. These neo-epitopes are subsequently presented to B cells by follicular dendritic cells in the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid tissues conditioning the break of self-tolerance. Activation of autoreactive B cells and subsequent production of autoantibodies facilitate the formation of immune complexes (ICs) fueling the inflammatory response and leading to further tissue damage. ICs may also be ingested by phagocytes, which then produce further pro-inflammatory cytokines. These processes establish a vicious circle that leads to sustained .

Previous studies have identified mitigation of wear particle-induced  and bone resorption as the main approaches to treat PPO. Recently, wear particle-induced reduction of bone formation around the prosthesis was identified as a major factor in the development of PPO. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), a derivative of frankincense, has been shown to play a potential role in bone metabolism. However, whether AKBA enhances bone formation in wear particle-induced osteolysis remains unknown. In this study, we examined whether AKBA attenuates titanium particle-induced osteogenic reduction.  Titanium particles were used to induce osteolysis in murine calvaria, and micro-CT and histological analyses were used to evaluate the results. Mouse osteoblast cells, MC3T3-E1 were co-cultured with titanium particles to determine their effect on osteoblast formation .  We demonstrated that AKBA treatment significantly inhibited titanium particle-induced osteogenic inhibition by enhancing osteogenesis both  and . AKBA treatment also enhanced the phosphorylation of GSK-3β, decreased the degradation of β-catenin, and increased the translocation of β-catenin from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Taken together, these results showed that AKBA treatment attenuated titanium-induced osteogenic inhibition by activating the GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway.

Each sample was prepared via extraction using different ethanol ratios with the objective of evaluationg optimal extraction conditions for industrial application. Aqueous 50% (v/v) EtOH extract of  petal significantly suppressed tyrosinase activity, melanin production, and solar UV-induced matrix metalloproteinase-1, a hall mark of wrinkle formation. In addition, the aqueous 50% (v/v) EtOH extract showed the highest antioxidative effect and had highest flavonoid contents, consistent with the reported anti-aging effects. Overall, our findings suggest that  petals extracts exhibit anti-aging effects. Furthermore, 50% EtOH extraction, in particular, was optimal for the highest anti-aging, and anti-oxidative effects as well as to obtain the highest flavonoid content.© The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695567>Hepatoprotective effect of ultrasonicated ginseng berry extract on a rat mild bile duct ligation model.</a></h2><p>The  berry extract (GBE) is well known to have an antidiabetic effect. The aim of this study is to evaluate and investigate the protective effect of ultrasonication-processed  berry extract (UGBE) compared with GBE on liver fibrosis induced by mild bile duct ligation (MBDL) model in rats. After ultrasonication process, the composition ratio of ginsenoside in GBE was changed. The component ratio of ginsenosides Rh1, Rh4, Rg2, Rg3, Rk1, Rk3, and F4 in the extract was elevated.In this study, the protective effect of the newly developed UGBE was evaluated on hepatotoxicity and neuronal damage in MBDL model. Silymarin (150 mg/kg) was used for positive control. UGBE (100 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg), GBE (250 mg/kg), and silymarin (150 mg/kg) were orally administered for 6 weeks after MBDL surgery.The MBDL surgery induced severe hepatotoxicity that leads to liver  in rats. Also, the serum ammonia level was increased by MBDL surgery. However, the liver dysfunction of MBDL surgery-operated rats was attenuated by UGBE treatment via myeloid differentiation factor 88-dependent Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathways.UGBE has a protective effect on liver fibrosis induced by MBDL in rats through inhibition of the TLR4 signaling pathway in liver.© 2018 The Korean Society of Ginseng, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691891>Extracellular vesicles from mesenchymal stem cells reduce microglial-mediated neuroinflammation after cortical injury in aged Rhesus monkeys.</a></h2><p>Cortical injury, such as injuries after stroke or age-related ischemic events, triggers a cascade of degeneration accompanied by inflammatory responses that mediate neurological deficits. Therapeutics that modulate such neuroinflammatory responses in the aging brain have the potential to reduce neurological dysfunction and promote recovery. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are lipid-bound, nanoscale vesicles that can modulate  and enhance recovery in rodent stroke models. We recently assessed the efficacy of intravenous infusions of MSC-EVs (24-h and 14-days post-injury) as a treatment in aged rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) with cortical injury that induced impairment of fine motor function of the hand. Aged monkeys treated with EVs after injury recovered motor function more rapidly and more fully than aged monkeys given a vehicle control. Here, we describe EV-mediated inflammatory changes using histological assays to quantify differences in markers of neuroinflammation in brain tissue between EV and vehicle-treated aged monkeys. The activation status of microglia, the innate macrophages of the brain, is critical to cell fate after injury. Our findings demonstrate that EV treatment after injury is associated with greater densities of ramified, homeostatic microglia, along with reduced pro-inflammatory microglial markers. These findings are consistent with a phenotypic switch of inflammatory hypertrophic microglia towards anti-inflammatory, homeostatic functions, which was correlated with enhanced functional recovery. Overall, our data suggest that EVs reduce neuroinflammation and shift microglia towards restorative functions. These findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of MSC-derived EVs for reducing neuroinflammation after cortical injury in the aged brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692432>Effects of Aging and Diet on Cardioprotection and Cardiometabolic Risk Markers.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of several diseases increases by age, including cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Aging, as a complex process characterized by graduated senescence, triggers various pathways such as oxidative stress, systemic , metabolism dysfunction, but also telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction and deregulated autophagy. A better understanding of the senescence underlying mechanisms may lead to the development of new therapeutic targets and strategies for the age-related pathologies and extend the healthy lifespan. Modulating lifestyle risk factors and adopting healthy dietary patterns remain powerful tools which may delay the aging process, decrease age-associated co-morbidities and mortality, increase life expectancy, and, consequently, prevent the development of the cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, such a strategy represents the most cost-effective approach, and the subjects' quality of life may be significantly improved. An integrated, personalized approach targeting at cardiometabolic aging and frailty is suggested in daily clinical practice. However, it should be started from an early age, while there is a need for further well designed and controlled studies in order to elucidate a link between the time of feeding, longevity and cardiovascular prevention. In the future, it is expecting that the pharmacological treatment in cardioprotective management will be necessary accompanied by equally important lifestyle interventions and adjunctive exercise.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696456>Sustained BMP-2 release and platelet rich fibrin synergistically promote tendon-bone healing after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in rat.</a></h2><p>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries which cause knee disabilities remain a clinical challenge due to the compromised tendon-bone repair. Multiple strategies have been proposed to treat the tendon-bone injuries, and the combination of these therapies hold great potential to achieve synergistic effects.We built PLGA-BMP-2 (bone morphogenetic protein 2) system and confirmed the sustained release of BMP-2 both in vitro and in vivo. We then applied different therapies to treat rat ACL reconstruction. We collected the tissue sample and analyzed the BMP-2 concentration both in serum and in injured sites. We tested the mRNA expression of genes that were related to , tissue repair and bone formation in damaged tissues. We also analyzed the protein levels of some genes associated with tendon formation and check the function of newly generated bone through biomechanical test.We found that, compared to monotherapies, simultaneous utilization of sustained BMP-2 release and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction showed better therapeutic effects on tendon-bone healing in rat. This combined therapy efficiently enhanced the levels of growth factors that favor the angiogenesis and relieved the inflammatory responses in the injured sites. Of note, the combined therapy efficiently promoted the signals associated with bone formation and tendon regeneration.We demonstrated that the combined therapy with BMP-2 and PRF achieves synergistic effects on tendon-bone healing and holds great potential for the treatment of ACL reconstruction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691463>Pre-treatments enhance the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells in liver diseases.</a></h2><p>Liver diseases caused by viral infection, alcohol abuse and metabolic disorders can progress to end-stage liver failure, liver cirrhosis and liver cancer, which are a growing cause of death worldwide. Although liver transplantation and hepatocyte transplantation are useful strategies to promote liver regeneration, they are limited by scarce sources of organs and hepatocytes. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) restore liver injury after hepatogenic differentiation and exert immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, antioxidative stress and antiapoptotic effects on liver cells in vivo. After isolation and culture in vitro, MSCs are faced with nutrient and oxygen deprivation, and external growth factors maintain MSC capacities for further applications. In addition, MSCs are placed in a harsh microenvironment, and anoikis and  after transplantation in vivo significantly decrease their regenerative capacity. Pre-treatment with chemical agents, hypoxia, an inflammatory microenvironment and gene modification can protect MSCs against injury, and pre-treated MSCs show improved hepatogenic differentiation, homing capacity, survival and paracrine effects in vitro and in vivo in regard to attenuating liver injury. In this review, we mainly focus on pre-treatments and the underlying mechanisms for improving the therapeutic effects of MSCs in various liver diseases. Thus, we provide evidence for the development of MSC-based cell therapy to prevent acute or chronic liver injury. Mesenchymal stem cells have potential as a therapeutic to prolong the survival of patients with end-stage liver diseases in the near future.© 2019 The Authors.

Initial lymphatics subsequently drain this fluid into the collecting lymphatics. This paper describes a computational model for a network of passive rat mesenteric lymphatic vessels with sparse secondary valves. The network was simulated with the secondary valves both operational and non-operational. The effects on the cycle-mean outflow-rate from the network of both  and the resistance of the surrounding interstitium were considered. The cycle-mean outflow-rate is sensitive to vessel stiffness. If the influence of primary-valve resistance is reduced relative to that of interstitial resistance and intravascular resistance, there is no absolute advantage of extrinsic pumping, since maximum outflow-rate occurs when vessels are rigid. However, there is relative advantage, in that the outflow-rate at intermediate stiffness is higher with the secondary valves functioning than when they are deactivated. If primary-valve resistance dominates, then extrinsic pumping of non-rigid vessels provides absolute advantage. The nonlinear relation between pressure drop and flow-rate of the endothelial primary valves, combined with downstream compliance and pulsatile external pressure, constitutes a separate mechanism of pumping. By enabling the consideration of interactions between multiple phenomena (primary valves, secondary valves, a real network geometry with multiple branches, deformable vessel walls, interstitial resistance and external pressures), the model offers a perspective for delineating physiological phenomena that have not yet been fully linked to the biomechanics of fluid flow through initial lymphatic networks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693921>Immune activation, immune senescence and levels of Epstein Barr Virus in kidney transplant patients: impact of mTOR inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders(PTLD) represent a severe complication in transplanted patients and Epstein-Barr Virus(EBV) is the main driver. Besides immunodepression, immune activation/chronic  play an important role in both virus reactivation and expansion of EBV-positive B cells. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of immunosuppressive strategies on factors involved in the PTLD's pathogenesis. 124 kidney transplanted patients were enrolled in this study: 71 were treated with mycophenolic acid(MPA) and 53 treated with mTOR inhibitor(mTORi), both in combination with different doses of calcineurin inhibitor. At the time of the transplant(T0), profile of /immune activation and immune senescence didn't differ between the two groups, but after one year of treatment(T1) markers were significantly higher in MPA-treated patients; their immunosenescence process was supported by the greater erosion of telomeres despite their younger age. Percentages of activated B cells and levels of EBV-DNA significantly increased in MPA-treated patients, and atT1 were significantly higher in MPA-than in mTORi-treated patients. Overall, these findings indicate that mTOR inhibitors constrain the /immune activation and senescence status, thus reducing the expansion of EBV-infected B cells and the risk of virus-associated PTLD in kidney transplant recipients.Copyright © 2019.

At quarterly study visits, symptoms that developed since acute EVD were recorded and blood was collected for biomarkers of  and immune activation.At baseline (mean 408 days from acute EVD), 75.5% of survivors reported at least one new cardinal symptom since surviving EVD, which in 85.8% was rated as highly interfering with life. Two or more incident symptoms were reported by 61.0% of survivors with pairings of joint pain, headache, or fatigue the most frequent. Women were significantly more likely than men to report headache while older age was significantly associated with musculoskeletal and visual symptoms. In analyses adjusted for multiple comparisons, no statistically significant association was found between any symptom and 26 markers of  and immune activation. Symptom frequency remained largely unchanged during study follow-up.Post-EVD complications occur in a majority of survivors and remain present more than 4 years after acute infection. An association between markers of  and immune activation and individual symptoms was not found, suggesting an alternative etiology for persistent post-EVD symptomatology.© The Author(s) 2019.

It was shown that DSE significantly ameliorated the production of lipogenesis-related factors, including liver X receptor-α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, and CD36. In addition, DSE significantly reduced the production of  factors, including interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and nuclear factor kappa B. Furthermore, DSE significantly reduced the phosphorylation of c-Jun amino terminal kinase. Taken together, this suggests that DSE may be a functional food candidate for regulating NAFLD, based on its effects.© The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694322>Medium Chain Triglyceride (MCT) Oil Affects the Immunophenotype via Reprogramming of Mitochondrial Respiration in Murine Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil has been postulated to modulate inflammatory responses, but the detailed mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Based on recent studies demonstrating that mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming and immune responses are correlated, the current study sought to determine whether MCT oil controls inflammatory responses through modulation of mitochondria using both in vitro and in vivo models. The mitochondrial metabolic phenotypes of macrophages were assessed according to oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Inflammatory responses were assessed for production of cytokines and expression of activation markers. MCT oil was more rapidly oxidized as observed by increased OCR in macrophages. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was down-regulated and anti-inflammatory cytokine was elevated by MCT oil. In addition, classically activated M1 and alternatively activated M2 markers were reciprocally regulated by MCT intervention. Overall, up-regulated β-oxidation by MCT contributes to the anti-inflammatory M2-like status of macrophages, which may aid in the dietary prevention and/or amelioration of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694652>Unique patterns of lower respiratory tract microbiota are associated with  and hospital mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome.</a></h2><p>The lung microbiome maintains the homeostasis of the immune system within the lungs. In acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the lung microbiome is enriched with gut-derived bacteria; however, the specific microbiome associated with morbidity and mortality in patients with ARDS remains unclear. This study investigated the specific patterns of the lung microbiome that are correlated with mortality in ARDS patients.We analyzed the lung microbiome from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with ARDS and control subjects. We measured the copy numbers of 16S rRNA and the serum and BALF cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, receptor for advanced glycation end products, and angiopoietin-2).We analyzed 47 mechanically ventilated patients diagnosed with (n = 40) or without (n = 7; control) ARDS. The alpha diversity was significantly decreased in ARDS patients compared with that of the controls (6.24 vs. 8.07, P = 0.03). The 16S rRNA gene copy numbers tended to be increased in the ARDS group compared with the controls (3.83 × 10 vs. 1.01 × 10 copies/mL, P = 0.06). ARDS patients were subdivided into the hospital survivor (n = 24) and non-survivor groups (n = 16). Serum IL-6 levels were significantly higher in the non-survivors than in the survivors (567 vs. 214 pg/mL, P = 0.027). The 16S rRNA copy number was significantly correlated with serum IL-6 levels in non-survivors (r = 0.615, P < 0.05). The copy numbers and relative abundance of betaproteobacteria were significantly lower in the non-survivors than in the survivors (713 vs. 7812, P = 0.012; 1.22% vs. 0.08%, P = 0.02, respectively). Conversely, the copy numbers of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Enterobacteriaceae were significantly correlated with serum IL-6 levels in the non-survivors (r = 0.579, P < 0.05; r = 0.604, P < 0.05; r = 0.588, P < 0.05, respectively).The lung bacterial burden tended to be increased, and the alpha diversity was significantly decreased in ARDS patients.

Activity in the hippocampus-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) pathway has been suggested to correlate with spontaneous pain and pain chronicity, but causal evidence is lacking. Here we combine longitudinal in vivo electrophysiological recording with behavioral testing and show that persistent spontaneous pain disrupts ventral hippocampal CA1-infralimbic cortex (vCA1-IL) connectivity and hippocampal modulation of IL neuronal activity in rats with peripheral . Chemo- and optogenetic rescue of vCA1-IL dysfunction relieves spontaneous pain. Circuit-specific overexpression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in vCA1-IL reverses electrophysiological changes, relieves spontaneous pain, and accelerates overall recovery from inflammatory pain. Our work identifies a neural pathway that specifically correlates with spontaneous pain and supports the significance of using a circuit dynamics-based strategy for more comprehensive understanding of circuitry mechanisms underlying chronic pain.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

A wealth of information based on robust research evidence can be gleaned from blood tests, including: the identification of iron, vitamin or energy deficiency; the identification of oxidative stress and ; and the status of red blood cell populations. Serial blood test data can be used to monitor athletes and make inferences about the efficacy of training interventions, nutritional strategies or indeed the capacity to tolerate training load. Via a profiling and monitoring approach, blood biomarker measurement combined with contextual data has the potential to help athletes avoid injury and illness via adjustments to diet, training load and recovery strategies. Since wide inter-individual variability exists in many biomarkers, clinical population-based reference data can be of limited value in athletes, and statistical methods for longitudinal data are required to identify meaningful changes within an athlete.

A large number of STEMI patients after the infarction gradually develop heart failure due to the infarcted myocardium. Timely reperfusion is essential to salvage ischemic myocardium from the infarction, but the restoration of coronary blood flow in the infarct-related artery itself induces myocardial injury and cardiomyocyte death, known as ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). The factors contributing to IRI in STEMI are complex, and microvascular obstruction, , release of reactive oxygen species, myocardial stunning, and activation of myocardial cell death are involved. Therefore, additional cardioprotection is required to prevent the heart from IRI. Although many mechanical conditioning procedures and pharmacological agents have been identified as effective cardioprotective approaches in animal studies, their translation into the clinical practice has been relatively disappointing due to a variety of reasons. With new emerging data on cardioprotection in STEMI over the past few years, it is mandatory to reevaluate the effectiveness of "old" cardioprotective interventions and highlight the novel therapeutic targets and new treatment strategies of cardioprotection.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695404>Systemic  score in locally advanced rectal cancer patients following total mesorectal excision.</a></h2><p>The objective of the study was to evaluate whether any association exists between systemic  score (SIS) and adverse events (AEs) and survival of locally advanced rectal cancer patients treated with total mesorectal excision (TME) followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.All of the 109 rectal cancer patients recruited between May 2008 and June 2015 were treated with TME followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The prognostic ability of SIS for overall survival (OS) was calculated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.According to the classification of the SIS, 22 (20.2%), 59 (54.1%) and 28 (25.7%) patients were classified as a score of 2, 1 and 0, respectively. With an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.616, the SIS score of 1 was defined as the optimal cut-off value. Therefore, we divided the patients into the SIS-low group (SIS score of 1 or 0, n=87) and SIS-high group (SIS score of 2, n=22). Multivariate analysis indicated that SIS was associated with OS (HR 0.390, 95% CI 0.186-0.817, =0.012). The 5-year OS rate in patients without adjuvant chemotherapy was lower than the patients with adjuvant chemotherapy (53.3% vs 75.8%, =0.010). Multivariate analysis showed that adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with OS (HR 0.217, 95% CI 0.089-0.529, =0.001). A marginal statistically significant difference was observed in terms of leukopenia during adjuvant chemoradiotherapy between the SIS-low group and the SIS-high group (=0.05).These results suggest that SIS might serve as an independent biomarker for predicting AEs and prognosis in locally advanced rectal cancer treated with TME followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Strengthening treatment may be administered to locally advanced rectal cancer with high SIS score obtained before adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.© 2019 Feng et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693934>Validation of a clinical assessment tool for cicatrising conjunctivitis.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to validate a semi-quantitative clinical assessment tool for cicatrising conjunctivitis (CC).Fifty-five patients (109 eyes) with mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) and 31 patients (61 eyes) with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) were included. Three methods were used for validation: (1) comparison of inter-and intra-observer reproducibility for the components selected for the initial version of the tool, (2) quantitative measurement of the scarring component with a fornix depth measurer, compared with qualitative Tauber grading methodology, (3) the final version of the tool was compared with the published Sotozono SJS grading system. Main outcome measures included: inter- and intra-observer reproducibility, calculation of composite measures of scarring and morbidity, component redundancy, and correlation with other grading systems.Inter- and intra-observer agreement was moderate-to-excellent for graded components of conjunctival hyperaemia, upper and lower symblepharon, upper and lower fornix depth, corneal vascularisation, and corneal opacity. There was poor-to-good agreement for limitation of motility which was rejected from inclusion in the final tool. Composite scores for scarring components and morbidity components showed good-to-excellent agreement and distribution of ocular disease severity. Analysis of the composite components showed no redundancy - all components contributed independently. Comparison with both Tauber and Sotozono grading methodologies showed good concordance.This study has developed the first validated assessment tool applicable to causes of CC.

Unlike the highly polymorphic MHC proteins, monomorphic Ag-presenting molecules such as MR1, CD1d, and CD1b present Ags to T cells with species-wide TCR motifs. CD1b tetramer studies and a survey of the 27 published CD1b-restricted TCRs demonstrated a TCR motif in humans defined by the TCR β-chain variable gene 4-1 (TRBV4-1) region. Unexpectedly, TRBV4-1 was involved in recognition of CD1b regardless of the chemical class of the carried lipid. Crystal structures of two CD1b-specific TRBV4-1 TCRs show that germline-encoded residues in CDR1 and CDR3 regions of TRBV4-1-encoded sequences interact with each other and consolidate the surface of the TCR. Mutational studies identified a key positively charged residue in TRBV4-1 and a key negatively charged residue in CD1b that is shared with CD1c, which is also recognized by TRBV4-1 TCRs. These data show that one TCR V region can mediate a mechanism of recognition of two related monomorphic Ag-presenting molecules that does not rely on a defined lipid Ag.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696069>The role of immunohistochemistry expression of COX-2 in differentiating pigmented benign and malignant skin neoplasms.</a></h2><p> Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and its annual mortality rate is increasing. The induction enzyme of cyclooxygenase COX-2 causes biosynthesis of prostaglandin and thromboxane during  of the body. Increasing the expression of COX-2 has an important role in the development and progression of malignant epithelial cancers and other types of cancers. Considering the diagnostic status of the marker, this study aimed to evaluate the expression of COX-2 for diagnosis and differentiation of benign skin pigmented neoplastic lesions from malignant melanoma types.  In this diagnostic study, the immunohistochemistry of COX-2 maker in 82 paraffin blocks of pigmented benign and malignant skin neoplasms of patients (49 men; 33 women) and its association with clinicopathological features of the tumor was evaluated. Data were analyzed using chi-squared and t test in SPSS18. Significance level was set at less than 5%.  The findings showed that 20 patients (24.3%) had malignant melanoma and 13 had significant COX-2 (3+ High), while COX-2 marker was not detected in other benign and malignant pigmented skin neoplasms (p<0.001). A significant association was found between COX-2 marker and grade (p<0.001), but there was no significant correlation with other clinicopathological tumor criteria. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV value of the COX-2 marker were 65%, 100%, 89.9%, and 100%, respectively.  Because of the high level of COX-2 in malignant melanoma skin marker, it can be used to distinguish benign and malignant neoplastic lesions (SCC and BCC) from melanoma and to provide effective therapeutic strategies through specific COX-2 enzyme inhibitors.© 2019 Iran University of Medical Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695038>IL-27 receptor-regulated stress myelopoiesis drives abdominal aortic aneurysm development.</a></h2><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a prevalent life-threatening disease, where aortic wall degradation is mediated by accumulated immune cells. Although cytokines regulate  within the aorta, their contribution to AAA via distant alterations, particularly in the control of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation, remains poorly defined. Here we report a pathogenic role for the interleukin-27 receptor (IL-27R) in AAA, as genetic ablation of IL-27R protects mice from the disease development. Mitigation of AAA is associated with a blunted accumulation of myeloid cells in the aorta due to the attenuation of Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced HSC expansion. IL-27R signaling is required to induce transcriptional programming to overcome HSC quiescence and increase differentiation and output of mature myeloid cells in response to stress stimuli to promote their accumulation in the diseased aorta. Overall, our studies illuminate how a prominent vascular disease can be distantly driven by a cytokine-dependent regulation of bone marrow precursors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694333>Macrophages Inability to Mediate Adherent-Invasive  Replication is Linked to Autophagy in Crohn's Disease Patients.</a></h2><p>The macrophages from Crohn's Disease (CD) patients are defective to control the replication of CD-associated adherent-invasive  (AIEC). We aimed to identify the host factors associated with AIEC replication focusing on polymorphisms related to autophagy. Peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), obtained from 95 CD patient, 30 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and 15 healthy subjects, were genotyped for several CD-associated polymorphisms. AIEC bacteria survival increased within MDM from CD patients compared to UC ( = 0.0019). AIEC bacteria survival increased in patients with CD-associated polymorphism  ( = 0.05) and reduced in those with CD-associated polymorphisms  ( = 0.026) and  ( = 0.033). AIEC infection led to an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β ( < 0.0001) and TNF-α ( < 0.0001) in CD macrophages. ULK-1 expression increased in AIEC-infected MDM from CD patients compared to MDM from UC patients or healthy subjects ( = 0.0056) and correlated with AIEC survival ( = 0.0013). Moreover, the expression of ULK-1 phosphorylation on Serine 757 decreased following to AIEC infection ( < 0.0001). Short-term silencing of ULK-1 and IRGM genes restricted and promote, respectively, AIEC survival within MDM ( = 0.0018 and  = 0.0291). In conclusion, the macrophage defect to mediate AIEC clearance in CD patients is linked to polymorphisms related to autophagy such as IRGM and ULK-1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694910>Activation of NLRX1 by NX-13 Alleviates Inflammatory Bowel Disease through Immunometabolic Mechanisms in CD4 T Cells.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex autoimmune disease with dysfunction in pattern-recognition responses, including within the NLR family. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat containing X1 (NLRX1) is a unique NLR with regulatory and anti-inflammatory functions resulting in protection from IBD in mouse models. NX-13 is an orally active, gut-restricted novel drug candidate that selectively targets and activates the NLRX1 pathway locally in the gut. In vitro and in vivo efficacy of NLRX1 activation by NX-13 was examined. Oral treatment with NX-13 alleviates disease severity, colonic leukocytic infiltration, and cytokine markers of  in three mouse models of IBD (dextran sulfate sodium, Mdr1a, and CD45RB adoptive transfer). Treatment of naive CD4 T cells with NX-13 in vitro decreases differentiation into Th1 and Th17 subsets with increased oxidative phosphorylation and decreased NF-κB activation and reactive oxygen species. With stimulation by PMA/ionomycin, TNF-α, or HO, PBMCs from ulcerative colitis patients treated with NX-13 had decreased NF-κB activity, TNF-α and IFN-γ CD4 T cells and overall production of IL-6, MCP1, and IL-8. NX-13 activates NLRX1 to mediate a resistance to both inflammatory signaling and oxidative stress in mouse models and human primary cells from ulcerative colitis patients with effects on NF-κB activity and oxidative phosphorylation. NX-13 is a promising oral, gut-restricted NLRX1 agonist for treating IBD.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694290>Impact of Donor Human Milk in the Preterm Very Low Birth Weight Gut Transcriptome Profile by Use of Exfoliated Intestinal Cells.</a></h2><p>Own mother's milk (OMM) is the optimal nutrition for preterm infants. However, pasteurized donor human milk (DHM) is a valid alternative. We explored the differences of the transcriptome in exfoliated epithelial intestinal cells (EEIC) of preterm infants receiving full feed with OMM or DHM.The prospective observational study included preterm infants ≤ 32 weeks' gestation and/or ≤1500 g birthweight. Total RNA from EEIC were processed for genome-wide expression analysis.Principal component analysis and unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis revealed two clustered groups corresponding to the OMM and DHM groups that showed differences in the gene expression profile in 1629 transcripts. The OMM group overexpressed lactalbumin alpha gene (), Cytochrome C oxidase subunit I gene () and caseins kappa gene (), beta gene () and alpha gene () and underexpressed Neutrophil Cytosolic Factor 1 gene () compared to the DHM group.The transcriptomic analysis of EEIC showed that OMM induced a differential expression of specific genes that may contribute to a more efficient response to a pro-oxidant challenge early in the postnatal period when preterm infants are at a higher risk of oxidative stress.

However, the organ-specific properties of isoform-specific HDACIs have not been fully evaluated. Also, whether they can act synergistically is not known. We hypothesized that isoform-specific HDACIs are superior to VPA in attenuating intestinal injury and act synergistically when coadministered.Sprague Dawley rats were hemorrhaged (40% of total blood volume) and randomized to receive (n=4 per group) (1) MC1568 (5 mg/kg), (2) ACY1083 (30 mg/kg), (3) MC1568+ACY1083 (combination: 5 mg/kg + 30 mg/kg, respectively), (4) VPA (250 mg/kg), or (5) normal saline (NS; vehicle; 250 μL). Animals were observed for 3 hours, after which blood samples were collected and samples of the ileum were harvested. Expression of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 1 (CINC-1) was assessed in the tissues using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Intestinal cleaved caspase 3 (c-caspase 3) levels were assessed as a marker of apoptosis, and histologic sections of the ileum were examined for signs of bowel injury. Levels of IL-1β and TNF-α were also measured in the serum as global markers of .Treatments with MC1568, ACY1083, MC1568+ACY1083, and VPA were associated with decreased IL-1β levels in the intestine and serum compared with NS. IL-1β and TNF-α levels were significantly lower in the ACY1083 group compared with the VPA group. CINC-1 levels were significantly lower in the isoform-specific HDACI groups compared with the NS; however, no significant differences were seen with VPA. All treatment groups had a lower expression of intestinal c-caspase 3 compared with NS. Furthermore, MC1568 and ACY1083 groups had lower apoptosis compared with the VPA group. Bowel injury scores were significantly lower in the isoform-specific HDACI groups compared with the NS group; however, the attenuation in the VPA-treated animals did not reach statistical significance.Isoform-specific HDACIs provide superior intestinal protection compared with VPA in a rodent model of hemorrhagic shock.Preclinical study.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Subcortical white matter lesions and oligodendrocyte (OLG) loss caused by cerebral ischemia have been implicated in the development of post-ischemic depression and cognitive impairment. OLGs are necessary for axonal myelination; the disrupted differentiation of OLG progenitor cells (OPCs) is associated with impaired remyelination. Evidence has indicated that increased levels of inflammatory cytokines released from activated microglia induce depression-like behaviors by affecting neurotransmitter pathways, but the mechanisms remain elusive. We explored the potential mechanisms that link microglia activation with GCI-induced depression and cognitive dysfunction by studying effects of minocycline on white matter damage, cytokine levels, and the monoaminergic neurotransmitters. An acute GCI animal model was generated through bilateral common carotid artery occlusion to induce ischemic  and subcortical white matter damage. Minocycline, an inhibitor of microglia activation, was intraperitoneally administrated immediately after surgery and continued daily for additional six days. Minocycline shortened the immobile duration in tail suspension test and forced swimming test, while no improvement was found in Morris water maze test. The plasma levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, HMGB1, and netrin-1 were significantly reduced with the treatment of minocycline. Minocycline treatment substantially reversed demyelination in corpus callosum and hippocampus, alleviated hippocampal microglia activation, and promoted OPCs maturation, while no effect was found on hippocampal neurodegeneration. Besides, the content of dopamine (DA) in the hippocampus was upregulated by minocycline treatment after GCI. Collectively, our data demonstrated that minocycline exerts an anti-depressant effect by inhibiting microglia activation, promoting OPCs maturation and remyelination. Increased DA in hippocampus may also play a role in ameliorating depressive behavior with minocycline treatment.Copyright © 2019 Du, Li, Zheng, Fan, Liang, Lian, Wei, Zhang and Bi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693502>Metastatic Crohn Disease: A Clinicohistological Appraisal From a Tertiary Care Center in India.</a></h2><p>Granulomatous dermatitis due to noncontiguous involvement of Crohn disease (CD) of the gut has been described as metastatic CD (MCD). MCD is the rarest form of cutaneous manifestations of CD. This study aims to analyze the clinicohistological features of MCD in a tertiary care center of India.A retrospective review of patients diagnosed clinically and histologically with MCD over past 5 years was performed. Data on cutaneous features, histological findings, and response to treatment were collected.Twelve patients (3 men and 9 women) with a mean age of 29 years were identified. All women had vulval involvement in the form of edema (80%), ulceration (60%), and fistula (20%). Among the 3 men, 2 had perineal and scrotal swelling and ulcer, whereas the third patient presented with leg ulcer. Intestinal CD was already diagnosed in 50% patients (5/10) at cutaneous presentation, whereas it was diagnosed subsequently in 30% (3/10) cases. Histological examination revealed nonnecrotizing granulomatous  in the dermis in 11 patients (92%). Additional histological features included eosinophilic infiltrate (58%), panniculitis (33%), and vasculitis (33%). The patients were treated with various combinations of oral prednisolone, metronidazole, minocycline, azathioprine, and subcutaneous adalimumab with partial relief.MCD shows a wide spectrum of clinical presentation, with anogenital involvement being the most common. Histology reveals nonnecrotizing granulomas in the dermis in majority of the cases. The diagnosis is extremely challenging in patients without gastrointestinal involvement at presentation, and thus, a high index of suspicion is imperative.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692436>The Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Anacardic Acid on a TNF-α - Induced Human Saphenous Vein Endothelial Cell Culture Model.</a></h2><p>Coronary bypass operations are commonly performed for treatment of ischemic heart diseases. Coronary artery bypass surgery with autologous human saphenous vein maintains its importance as a commonly used therapy for advanced atherosclerosis. Vascular -related intimal hyperplasia and atherosclerotic progress have major roles in the pathogenesis of saphenous vein graft disease.In our study, we investigated the effect of anacardic acid (AA), which is a bioactive phytochemical in the shell of Anacardium occidentale, on atherosclerosis considering its inhibitory effect on NF-κB. We observed relative ICAM-1 and NF-κB mRNA levels by qRT-PCR method in a TNF-α-induced  model of saphenous vein endothelial cell culture after 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 5 µM of AA were applied to the cells. In addition, protein levels of ICAM-1 and NF-κB were evaluated by immunofluorescent staining. The results were compared between different concentrations of AA, and also with the control group.It was found that 5 µM, 1 µM and 0.5 µM of AA had toxic effects, while cytotoxicity decreased when 0.1 µM of AA was applied both alone and with TNF-α. When AA was applied with TNF-α, there was a decrease and suppression in NF-κB expression compared with the TNF-α group. TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression was significantly reduced more in the AA-applied group than in the TNF-α group.In accordance with our results, it can be said that AA has a protective role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and hence in saphenous vein graft disease.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695359>An Oral Whole-Cell Killed Nontypeable  Immunotherapeutic For The Prevention Of Acute Exacerbations Of Chronic Airway Disease.</a></h2><p>In subjects with chronic bronchitis, protection against acute bronchitis following oral administration of a whole-cell killed nontypeable  (NTHi) preparation was demonstrated in the mid-1980s. Subsequently, studies aiming to validate clinical efficacy of this oral treatment were complicated by a number of factors, including the modification of clinical definitions, the implications of which were not recognized at that time. The objective of this review is to integrate our pre-clinical and clinical research in this field conducted over the past 30 years to demonstrate the evolution of the idea of communication between mucosal surfaces through the common mucosal immune system and the development of an effective oral NTHi immunotherapy. Our earliest studies recruited subjects with chronic sputum production and high levels of culture-positive sputum for Gram-negative bacteria but by 2000, the clinical diagnostic focus had switched from "chronic bronchitis" to "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease" (COPD), which was functionally defined using spirometry. This change led to variable clinical trial results, confirming the importance of chronic sputum production and culture-positive sputum. Additional conditioning factors such as patient age and gender were influential in study populations with low culture-positive sputum production. Through this period, studies in human and in rodent models provided new insights into airway protection mechanisms and the pathogenesis of airway . Key findings were the importance of a dysbiosis within the airway microbiome, and the critical role of an interdependence between the bronchus and the gut, with a Peyer's patch-dependent extra-bronchus "loop" controlling the composition of the bronchus microbiome. Within this context, intercurrent virus infections initiate a microbiome-dependant hypersensitivity reaction involving Peyer's patch-derived Th17 cells. We conclude that whole-cell killed NTHi immunotherapy has consistent and significant benefits when examined in the context of changing clinical disease definitions, age and gender, and has the potential to change the natural history of chronic airway disease.© 2019 Clancy and Cripps.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693714>Maturation of arteriovenous fistulas in patients with and without preexisting hemodialysis catheters.</a></h2><p>Central venous catheter (CVC) placement has been linked to systemic .

Patients were divided into three groups according to preexisting CVCs and CVC types as follows: tunneled CVC ( = 23), nontunneled CVC ( = 223), and no CVC ( = 304). These three groups were compared in terms of AVF maturation and preoperative WBC profiles.The mean age of the patients was 61.1 ± 14.3 years. The AVF maturation rates of the tunneled CVC, nontunneled CVC and no CVC groups were 65.2%, 54.7% and 74.7%, respectively ( < 0.001). According to the uni- and multivariate analyses, only the nontunneled CVC group had a lower odds of AVF maturation compared to the no CVC group (adjusted odds ratio 0.43; 95% confidence interval 0.29-0.62). Patients with preexisting nontunneled CVC but not tunneled CVC also had significantly higher mean WBC and neutrophil counts but a lower percentage of lymphocytes than patients with no preexisting CVC.Preexisting nontunneled CVC had a negative impact on the successful maturation of the newly created AVF.

However, the simultaneous upregulation of BMPs and their antagonist, and the fact that both promote tumor aggressiveness seems contradictory and is not fully understood.We analyzed the transcriptomes of the metastatic 66cl4 and the non-metastatic 67NR cell lines of the 4T1 mouse mammary tumor model to search for factors that promote metastasis. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was used for mechanistic studies in the same cell lines. Furthermore, we analyzed gene expression patterns in human breast cancer biopsies obtained from public datasets to evaluate co-expression and possible relations to clinical outcome.We found that mRNA levels of the BMP-antagonist Grem1, encoding gremlin1, and the ligand Bmp4 were both significantly upregulated in cells and primary tumors of 66cl4 compared to 67NR. Depletion of gremlin1 in 66cl4 could impair metastasis to the lungs in this model. Furthermore, we found that expression of Grem1 correlated with upregulation of several stem cell markers in 66cl4 cells compared to 67NR cells. Both in the mouse model and in patients, expression of GREM1 associated with extracellular matrix organization, and formation, biosynthesis and modification of collagen. Importantly, high expression of GREM1 predicted poor prognosis in estrogen receptor negative breast cancer patients. Analyses of large patient cohorts revealed that amplification of genes encoding BMP-antagonists and elevation of the corresponding transcripts is evident in biopsies from more than half of the patients and much more frequent for the secreted BMP-antagonists than the intracellular inhibitors of SMAD signaling.In conclusion, our results show that GREM1 is associated with metastasis and predicts poor prognosis in ER-negative breast cancer patients.

GO is observed in 25-30% of patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism and more rarely in association with hypothyroid autoimmune thyroiditis. In addition, a small proportion of GO patients (1-2%) do not have a clinically overt thyroid dysfunction. Clinically, GO is characterized by proptosis,  involving the eyelids and the conjunctiva, extraocular muscle hypertrophy, with consequent reduction of ocular motility and diplopia, and in the most severe cases, compression of the optic nerves at the orbital apex, with reduction of visual acuity. At CT scan or MRI, a muscle increase involving the superior, medial and inferior rectus is quite typical. In the most severe forms, compression of the optic nerves at the orbital apex can be observed. Euthyroid GO is usually an early sign of a full-blown Graves' disease; however, in some cases, the orbital disease can remain isolated. Moreover, euthyroid GO can rarely be unilateral, which makes the picture even more confusing. Under those circumstances, the diagnostic process becomes obviously quite difficult, having other conditions mimicking GO been excluded. A number of inflammatory conditions affecting orbital tissue can mimic GO, thereby requiring an accurate evaluation for a proper differential diagnosis. The majority of these conditions are immune mediated. Most of them are benign, but they can be rather aggressive and some can cause visual loss. The most common inflammatory condition affecting orbital tissues and mimicking GO is idiopathic orbital . Other, more rare, orbital diseases that should be considered in the differential diagnosis are infections, orbital manifestations of systemic diseases, primitive and secondary orbital neoplasms, and orbital vascular alterations. In most instances, when an orbitopathy occurs in the absence of hyperthyroidism, the diagnosis of the disease underlying the ocular symptoms and signs is based on exclusion of the other conditions. Here we review the conditions that can mimic GO and how to distinguish them from this obnoxious eye disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696241>MiR-802 alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury by targeting Peli2.</a></h2><p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening medical condition.

Characterizing novel miRNAs implicated in ARDS pathogenesis may provide new therapeutic strategy for managing ARDS.We employed LPS-induced lung injury model to profile miRNAs associated with ARDS. We isolated one miRNA candidate and characterized its role in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proinflammatory cytokine production in lung macrophages. We further evaluated its functional role in ARDS model by assessing histological change, neutrophil activation, tissue permeability and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) production.

LPS-induced miR-802 downregulation was confirmed in lung macrophages. Overexpression of miR-802 significantly suppressed LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine production in vitro and alleviates LPS-induced acute lung injury in vivo. Peli2 was identified as a downstream target of miR-802 and found upregulated in ARDS model.

Lung function could potentially be restored with exogenous surfactant therapy, but clinical trials have so far been disappointing. These negative results may be explained by inactivation and/or too low doses of the administered surfactant. Surfactant based on a recombinant surfactant protein C analogue (rSP-C33Leu) is easy to produce and in this study we compared its effects on lung function and  with a commercial surfactant preparation in an adult rabbit model of ARDS.ARDS was induced in adult New Zealand rabbits by mild lung-lavages followed by injurious ventilation (V 20 m/kg body weight) until P/F ratio < 26.7 kPa. The animals were treated with two intratracheal boluses of 2.5 mL/kg of 2% rSP-C33Leu in DPPC/egg PC/POPG, 50:40:10 or poractant alfa (Curosurf®), both surfactants containing 80 mg phospholipids/mL, or air as control. The animals were subsequently ventilated (V 8-9 m/kg body weight) for an additional 3 h and lung function parameters were recorded. Histological appearance of the lungs, degree of lung oedema and levels of the cytokines TNFα IL-6 and IL-8 in lung homogenates were evaluated.Both surfactant preparations improved lung function vs. the control group and also reduced  scores, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and formation of lung oedema to similar degrees. Poractant alfa improved compliance at 1 h, P/F ratio and PaO at 1.5 h compared to rSP-C33Leu surfactant.This study indicates that treatment of experimental ARDS with synthetic lung surfactant based on rSP-C33Leu improves lung function and attenuates .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691738>Effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on experimental periodontitis and AhR/NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in a mouse model.</a></h2><p>Vitamin D has been known to have important regulatory functions in  and immune response and shows inhibitory effects on experimental periodontitis in animal models. However, the potential mechanism has yet to be clarified. Recent studies have highlighted Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and its downstream signaling as a crucial regulator of immune homeostasis and inflammatory regulation.This study aimed to clarify the effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3) on experimental periodontitis and AhR/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)/NLR pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathway in the gingival epithelium in a murine model.We induced periodontitis in male C57BL/6 wild-type mice by oral inoculation of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), and subsequently gave intraperitoneal VD3 injection to the mice every other day for 8 weeks. Afterwards, we examined the alveolar bone using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and detected the gingival epithelial protein using western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining.SEM images demonstrated that alveolar bone loss was reduced in the periodontitis mouse model after VD3 supplementation. Western blot analyses and immunohistochemical staining of the gingival epithelium showed that the expression of vitamin D receptor, AhR and its downstream cytochrome P450 1A1 were enhanced upon VD3 application. Additionally, VD3 decreased NF-κB p65 phosphorylation, and NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein, caspase-1, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-6 protein expression.These results implicate the alleviation of periodontitis and the alteration of AhR/NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway by VD3 in the mouse model. The attenuation of this periodontal disease may correlate with the regulation of AhR/NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway by VD3.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696645>Total flavonoids of Epimedium ameliorates testicular damage in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats by suppressing  and oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Testicular damage is the anomaly that will often accompany diabetes mellitus. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the role that total flavonoids of Epimedium (TFE) played against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic testicular dysfunction and to elucidate the mechanism of action. The diabetic rat model was induced by vein injection of STZ in healthy rats. Thirty male healthy Spraque-Dawley rats were randomly divided into following groups: the control group, the diabetic group, and the diabetic + TFE group. Gastrointestinal administration begins at fifth week of TFE for 6 weeks. After TFE administration, all animals were euthanized. Testicular tissue samples and blood samples of rats were collected for histopathological examination and for determination of levels of various biomarkers including blood glucose, testosterone, testicular enzymes, and oxidative stress indicators. All testes were weighted to calculate the testicular organ index. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used for observing the testis and epididymis pathological changes. Protein expression (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, transforming growth factor-beta-1, interleukin-6, and 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) was detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot techniques. There was a significant difference in the changes between the diabetes group and the control group. As a result of treat with TFE, the blood glucose decreased but there was no significant difference, and other indicators showed significant improvement. TFE may protect against STZ-induced testicular injury by suppressing  and oxidative stress.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696490>MicroRNA-378 inhibits the development of smoking-induced COPD by targeting TNF-α.</a></h2><p>To explore the mechanism microRNA-378 in smoking-induced airway  and mucus hypersecretion.Human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells were treated with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) to construct the in vitro COPD model. Expression levels of microRNA-378, inflammatory factors and MUC5AC in CSE-treated HBE cells were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The regulatory effects of microRNA-378 on expressions of inflammatory factors and mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) were observed in CSE-treated HBE cells overexpressing microRNA-378. We verified whether tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was the target gene of microRNA-378 through dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Expression levels of TNF-α and p-p65 in CSE-treated HBE cells were examined. Finally, CSE-treated HBE cells were co-overexpressed with microRNA-378 and TNF-α to elucidate whether microRNA-378 exerted its function in regulating the development of COPD through targeting TNF-α.CSE treatment downregulated microRNA-378 expression, but upregulated expressions of inflammatory factors and MUC5AC in HBE cells. MicroRNA-378 overexpression markedly inhibited the elevated levels of inflammatory factors and MUC5AC in CSE-treated HBE cells. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay verified that TNF-α was the target gene of microRNA-378. Moreover, TNF-α expression in CSE-treated HBE cells was time-dependently elevated. TNF-α overexpression partially reversed the decreased levels of inflammatory factors and MUC5AC in HBE cells overexpressing microRNA-378.MicroRNA-378 inhibits the inflammatory response by targeting TNF-α, which may be a potential therapeutic target for COPD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694739>Aberrant glycosylation in autoimmune disease.</a></h2><p>Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) result in high levels of various autoantibodies in the serum as well as systemic  and targeted organ damage. The incidence of AID has increased over recent decades. Glycosylation is a significant part of the post-translational modification of proteins and has been recognised as an important part of immune regulation in humans. Aberrant glycosylation manifests as pro- or anti-inflammatory effects. Numerous studies have confirmed that aberrant glycosylation plays a crucial role in the AID process. The development of emerging technologies such as the lectin microarray has facilitated research on the structure and function of glycans and glycosylation. Newly developed devices allow for high-throughput, high-speed, and highly specific research on aberrant glycosylation. Here, we review the role of glycosylation in the regulation of effector function in the context of autoimmunity and aberrant glycosylation in AIDs.

Curcumin (CUR) is the principal curcuminoid of turmeric and possesses strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. This study explored the protective effect of CUR on Pb hepatotoxicity with an emphasis on oxidative stress,  and Akt/GSK-3β signaling. Rats received lead acetate and CUR and/or ascorbic acid (AA) for seven days and samples were collected for analyses. Pb(II) induced liver injury manifested by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as well as histopathological alterations, including massive hepatocyte degeneration and increased collagen deposition. Lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, TNF-α and DNA fragmentation were increased, whereas antioxidant defenses were diminished in the liver of Pb(II)-intoxicated rats. Pb(II) increased hepatic NF-κB and JNK phosphorylation and caspase-3 cleavage, whereas Akt and GSK-3β phosphorylation was decreased. CUR and/or AA ameliorated liver function, prevented tissue injury, and suppressed oxidative stress, DNA damage, NF-κB, JNK and caspase-3. In addition, CUR and/or AA activated Akt and inhibited GSK-3β in Pb(II)-induced rats. In conclusion, CUR prevents Pb(II) hepatotoxicity via attenuation of oxidative injury and , activation of Akt and inhibition of GSK-3β.

However, studies focusing on biological markers of osteitis are limited and it remains unclear whether osteitis is associated with different phenotypes of CRS. This study aimed to analyze the expression and assess the roles of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) in patients with CRS and osteitis.CRS patients with nasal polyps (CRSwNP, n = 63), CRS patients without nasal polyps (CRSsNP, n = 8), and control subjects (n = 12) were enrolled. Histologic phenotypes, clinical information, and computed tomography (CT) scores were investigated. The Global Osteitis Scoring Scale (GOSS) and RANKL, a molecular marker of bone remodeling, were analyzed in each type of CRS. CRS mouse models were treated with anti-RANKL.GOSS values were significantly higher in all CRS patients than in the control group. The GOSS value in non-eosinophilic CRSwNP was higher than in eosinophilic CRSwNP. RANKL was upregulated whereas decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG) was downregulated in CRS. RANKL messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels were positively correlated with GOSS. RANKL/OPG was increased in recurrent cases compared with primary cases. Multiple inflammatory mediators were positively correlated with the protein level of RANKL in CRS tissues. In the mouse CRSwNP model, anti-RANKL treatment abrogated mucosal  and bone remodeling.RANKL expression is associated with clinical osteitis and disease severity in CRSwNP. These findings shed light on the importance of RANKL as a potential biomarker of CRS and a key player in CRS pathogenesis.© 2019 ARS-AAOA, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695988>The Complex Relationship between Mesenteric Panniculitis and Malignancy - A Holistic Approach is Still Needed to Understand the Diagnostic Uncertainties.</a></h2><p>Mesenteric panniculitis is an idiopathic, localized  involving the adipose tissue of the small bowel mesentery.

We aimed to evaluate the utility of histology in predicting clinical outcomes in patients with AIN.Adult renal biopsies yielding a diagnosis of AIN between 2000 and 2015 were re-examined. Patients were divided into groups based on: 1) the percentage of non-fibrotic cortex containing  (NFI-score), (NFI-1=0-24%, NFI-2=25-74%, NFI-3=75-100%), and 2) the percentage of cortex containing tubular atrophy (TA score), (TA1=0-9%, TA2=10-24%, TA3=25-100%). The primary outcome was a composite of ≥50% reduction in serum creatinine (sCr) or an eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73m 1-year post-biopsy. From a total of 2817 native renal biopsies, there were 120 patients with AIN and adequate data for analysis. Of these, 66 (56%) achieved the primary outcome. On univariable logistic regression, NFI-3 was associated with a 16 times increased likelihood of achieving the primary outcome compared to NFI-1 (OR 16 (95% CI 5.2-50)). In contrast, TA3 were associated with a 90% reduced likelihood of achieving the primary outcome compared to TA1 (OR=0.10 (95%CI 0.0-0.3)). Maximal clinical utility was achieved by combining TA and NFI into a single prognostic 'TANFI' score, which had an independent predictive effect on the primary outcome in a multivariable regression model consisting of age, sex, baseline sCr and identified drug cause.In patients with biopsy-proven AIN, a lower percentage of cortical tubular atrophy and, paradoxically, a higher percentage of  in non-fibrosed cortex were associated with an increased likelihood of a positive clinical outcome.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695140>Association of dietary components with dyslipidemia and low-grade  biomarkers in adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia from different countries.</a></h2><p>The association of components of a low saturated fat (SFA) and of a Mediterranean diet was tested with atherosclerosis biomarkers in 190 familial hypercholesterolemia adults (FH) from Brazil (BR) and Spain (SP).

HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) suppress inflammatory activation of various cell types through epigenetic and non-epigenetic mechanisms, and ameliorate pathology in a mouse model of periodontitis. Activation of gingival fibroblasts (GFs) significantly contributes to the development of periodontitis and the anaerobic bacterium  plays a key role in driving chronic . Here, we analyzed the role of HDACs in inflammatory responses of GFs. Pan-HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and/or ITF2357 (givinostat) significantly reduced TNFα- and -inducible expression and/or production of a cluster of inflammatory mediators in healthy donor GFs (, and ) without affecting cell viability. Selective inhibition of HDAC3/6, but not specific HDAC1, HDAC6, or HDAC8 inhibition, reproduced the suppressive effects of pan-HDACi on the inflammatory gene expression profile induced by TNFα and , suggesting a critical role for HDAC3 in GF inflammatory activation. Consistently, silencing of HDAC3 expression with siRNA largely recapitulated the effects of HDAC3/6i on mRNA levels of inflammatory mediators in -infected GFs. In contrast,  internalization and intracellular survival in GFs remained unaffected by HDACi. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and NFκB signaling was unaffected by global or HDAC3/6-selective HDACi, and new protein synthesis was not required for gene suppression by HDACi. Finally, pan-HDACi and HDAC3/6i suppressed -induced expression of , and  in GFs from patients with periodontitis.

We previously showed that the effect of GluOC on insulin secretion is mediated predominantly by glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) released from intestinal endocrine cells in response to GluOC stimulation. Moreover, oral administration of GluOC was found to reduce the fasting blood glucose level, to improve glucose tolerance, and to increase the fasting serum insulin concentration and β-cell area in the pancreas in wild-type mice. We have now examined the effects of oral GluOC administration for at least 4 weeks in GLP-1 receptor knockout mice. Such administration of GluOC in the mutant mice triggered glucose intolerance, enhanced gluconeogenesis, and promoted both lipid accumulation in the liver as well as adipocyte hypertrophy and  in adipose tissue. Furthermore, inactivation of GLP-1 receptor signaling in association with GluOC administration induced activation of the transcription factor FoxO1 and expression of its transcriptional coactivator PGC1α in the liver, likely accounting for the observed up-regulation of gluconeogenic gene expression.

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a highly oxidative enzyme secreted by activated myeloid pro-inflammatory immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages, and is a key mediator of the damaging innate immune response. Current technologies for detecting MPO activity in living organisms are sparse and suffer from any combination of low specificity, low tissue penetration, or low spatial resolution. We describe a versatile imaging platform to detect MPO activity using an activatable construct conjugated to a biotin moiety (MPO-activatable biotinylated sensor, MABS) that allows monitoring the innate immune response and its modulation at different scales and settings.  We designed and synthesized MABS that contains MPO-specific and biotin moieties, and validated its specificity and sensitivity combining with streptavidin-labeled fluorescent agent and gold nanoparticles imaging  and  in multiple mouse models of  and infection, including Matrigel implant, dermatitis, cellulitis, cerebritis and complete Fraud's adjuvant (CFA)-induced .  MABS MPO imaging non-invasively detected varying MPO concentrations, MPO inhibition, and MPO deficiency  with high sensitivity and specificity. MABS can be used to obtain not only a fluorescence imaging agent, but also a CT imaging agent, conferring molecular activity information to a structural imaging modality. Importantly, using this method on tissue-sections, we found that MPO enzymatic activity does not always co-localize with MPO protein detected with conventional techniques (e.g., immunohistochemistry), underscoring the importance of monitoring enzymatic activity.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein (CRP), and PCT levels were all elevated in bacteremic patients in comparison to the other groups.

Similar to many other FPR2 agonistic peptides, nanomolar concentrations of both PSMα2 and PSMα3 activate neutrophils to increase the cytosolic concentration of Ca and release NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species. In addition, the PSMα peptides induce FPR2 homologous desensitization, actin polymerization, and neutrophil reactivation through a receptor cross-talk mechanism. However, in contrast to conventional FPR2 agonistic peptides, including the host-derived formyl peptide MCT-ND4, we found that the PSMα peptides lacked the ability to recruit β-arrestin and induce neutrophil chemotaxis, supporting the previous notion that β-arrestin translocation is of importance for cell migration. Despite the lack of β-arrestin recruitment, the PSMα peptides induced an FPR2-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation and internalization. Furthermore, structure-activity relationship analysis with PSMα2 derivatives revealed critical roles of the first 3 aa linked to N-fMet as well as the C terminus of PSMα2 in promoting FPR2 to recruit β-arrestin. In summary, our data demonstrate a novel neutrophil activation pattern upon FPR2 sensing of PSMα peptides, signified by the ability to induce increased intracellular Ca, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, internalization, and NADPH oxidase activity, yet lack of β-arrestin recruitment and neutrophil chemoattraction. These novel features adopted by the PSMα peptides could be of importance for  virulence and might facilitate identification of new therapeutic strategies for treating  infections.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694920>Distinct signals and immune cells drive liver pathology and glomerulonephritis in ABIN1[D485N] mice.</a></h2><p>We report that TLR7, IL-6, and the adaptive immune system are essential for autoimmunity and glomerulonephritis but not for liver pathology in mice expressing the ubiquitin-binding-defective ABIN1[D485N] mutant. The blood and organs of ABIN1[D485N] mice have exceptionally high numbers of patrolling monocytes (pMo), which develop independently of IL-6 and the adaptive immune system. They are detectable in the blood months before autoimmunity and organ pathology are seen and may have diagnostic potential. The splenic pMo, inflammatory monocytes (iMo), and neutrophils of ABIN1[D485N] mice expressed high levels of mRNAs encoding proteins released during NETosis, which together with the high numbers of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) may drive the liver pathology in ABIN1[D485N] mice, and contribute to the pathology of other organs. The splenic iMo of ABIN1[D485N] mice displayed high expression of mRNAs encoding proteins controlling cell division and were actively dividing; this may underlie the increased pMo and MoDC numbers, which are derived from iMo. An orally active IRAK4 inhibitor suppressed all facets of the disease phenotype and prevented the increase in pMo numbers.© 2019 Nanda et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694263>CMR Tissue Characterization in Patients with HFmrEF.</a></h2><p>The characteristics and optimal management of heart failure with a moderately reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF, LV-EF 40-50%) are still unclear.

We, therefore, examined 17 patients with HFpEF, 18 with HFmrEF, 17 with HFrEF and 17 healthy, age-matched controls with cardiac MRI (Phillips 1.5 T). T1 and T2 relaxation time mapping was performed and the extracellular volume (ECV) was calculated. Global circumferential (GCS) and longitudinal strain (GLS) were derived from cine images. GLS (-15.7 ± 2.1) and GCS (-19.9 ± 4.1) were moderately reduced in HFmrEF, resembling systolic dysfunction.

However, only patient subsets benefit from these expensive therapies, and often responses are short-lived or coincide with side effects. A growing modality in precision oncology is the development of theranostics, as this enables patient selection, treatment and monitoring. In this approach, labeled compounds and an imaging technology are used to diagnose patients and select the best treatment option, whereas for therapy, related compounds are used to target cancer cells or the tumor stroma. In this context, nanobodies and nanobody-directed therapeutics have gained interest. This interest stems from their high antigen specificity, small size, ease of labeling and engineering, allowing specific imaging and design of therapies targeting antigens on tumor cells, immune cells as well as proteins in the tumor environment. This review provides a comprehensive overview on the state-of-the-art regarding the use of nanobodies as theranostics, and their importance in the emerging field of personalized medicine.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692821>[Strangler hair syndrome: about a case].</a></h2><p>The syndrome of the tourniquet or "strangler hair" is the consequence of the strangulation of an appendage or body end by a constrictor link. Toes and fingers are the most affected extremities but also the genitals whether it is the penis, small or large lips or clitoris. Most of the links are hair, more rarely textile fibers (cotton, wool). The speed of diagnosis is important in order to proceed to the removal of the link as soon as possible and avoid seeing the process evolve towards necrosis or . Spontaneous or surgical amputation of the ischemic extremity. The difficulty lies in the fact that inflammatory edema following progressive constriction is a slow process that can last for weeks. The edema participates in the burying of the link making it accessible to the eye, delaying its ablation by increasing the risk of bone damage, necrosis and partial or total amputation. At the beginning of the process, incessant crying can summarize the symptomatology present by the infant. Different methods have been described to remove the link: mechanical or surgical removal. We report the case of an infant who presented edema and painful erythema of abrupt installation of the third left toe outside a traumatic context. The radiograph did not objectify a fracture or other abnormality and the exploration found constriction by the mother's hair. The evolution was favorable after ablation of the hairs and application of the healing creams.© Fatima-Zahra Agharbi et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694065>Electronic cigarettes: Tumultuous times.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693865>The association of Influenza infection and vaccine with myocardial infarction: systematic review and meta-analysis of self-controlled case series.</a></h2><p>: Influenza vaccination may be beneficial in coronary disease patients; however the infection and vaccination are associated to acute , a trigger of cardiovascular events.

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), EBV expresses few viral proteins but elevated levels of HI A rightward transcripts (BARTs) RNA, which includes viral microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). BART lncRNAs localize within the nucleus of EBV-infected cells and knockdown of BART lncRNAs significantly affects the expression of genes associated with cell adhesion, oxidoreductase activity, , and immunity. Notably, downregulation of  family zinc finger 3 (Aiolos), which plays a role in lymphocyte development and cell attachment, occurred in NPC C666-1 cells following BART lncRNA-knockdown. Since Aiolos expression is normally restricted to lymphoid cells and rarely observed in epithelial cells, induction of Aiolos by BART lncRNA was confirmed by expressing the major BART lncRNA isoform, , in EBV-positive and -negative cells. BART lncRNA associated with the CBP/p300 complex and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in the nucleus, suggesting that BART lncRNAs may mediate epigenetic regulation of gene expression through interaction with the chromatin remodeling machinery. This contention is further supported by evidence that BART lncRNA appears to stall Pol II at the promoter region and may regulate  and  expression by inhibiting transcription by Pol II in NPC. We hypothesize that EBV BART lncRNA expression modulates host gene expression and maintains EBV latency by interfering with histone methylation and acetylation processes. Aberrant expression of affected host genes mediated by BART lncRNA may lead to immune evasion, progression, and metastasis of NPC.Copyright © 2019 Verhoeven, Tong, Mok, Liu, He, Zong, Chen, Tsao, Lung and Chen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695780>Orally Deliverable Nanotherapeutics for the Synergistic Treatment of Colitis-Associated Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p> Colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) poses substantial challenges for effective treatment. Currently, there is a considerable need for the development of orally bioavailable dosage forms that enable the safe and effective delivery of therapeutic drugs to local diseased lesions in the gastrointestinal tract.  In this study, we developed orally deliverable nanotherapeutics for the synergistic treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and CAC. Water-insoluble curcumin (CUR) and 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38), which served as anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic agents, respectively, were chemically engineered into hydrophilic mucoadhesive chitosan for the generation of chitosan-drug amphiphiles. Results: The resulting amphiphilic constructs formed core-shell nanostructures in aqueous solutions and were orally administered for  therapeutic studies. Using a preclinical CAC mouse model, we showed that the orally delivered nanotherapeutics locally accumulated in inflamed intestinal regions and tumor tissues. Furthermore, the therapeutic synergy of the combined nanotherapeutics in CAC mice was evaluated. Compared with their individual drug forms, combined CUR and SN38 nanoparticles yielded synergistic effects to alleviate intestinal  and protect mice from ulcerative colitis. Notably, the combinatorial therapy demonstrated a remarkable tumor shrinkage with only ~6% of the total tumors exceeding 4 mm in diameter, whereas ~35% of tumors were observed to exceed a diameter of 4 mm in the saline-treated CAC mice. These data suggest a new and reliable approach for improving the treatment of IBD and CAC.  Our results showed that bioadhesive chitosan materials can be used to produce colloidal-stable nanotherapeutics that are suitable for oral delivery. Both nanotherapeutics exhibited substantial accumulation in inflamed intestinal regions and tumor tissues and showed good synergy for treating CAC, warranting further clinical translation.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695019>The Effects of Progranulin in a Rat Model of Acute Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion are Mediated by Activation of the P13K/Akt Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND Progranulin is an adipokine, encoded by the progranulin (GRN) gene. Progranulin is expressed in atherosclerosis, but its effects in cardiac ischemia and reperfusion injury are unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of progranulin in a rat model of acute myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury in vivo. MATERIAL AND METHODS The model of acute MI/R injury was established in male Wistar rats by ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery for 30 minutes and reperfusion for 60 minutes. Before modeling, one group was treated with progranulin (0.03 µg/kg), and one group was treated with the P13K/Akt inhibitor, LY294002 (3 mg/kg). Left ventricular function (LV) was monitored, including the LV systolic pressure (LVSP), LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and changes in LV pressure. At the end of the study, blood and myocardial tissue were examined. Cardiac biochemical markers, histopathology, gene expression, and apoptosis were analyzed. RESULTS Progranulin improved cardiac function following acute MI/R injury and significantly improved recovery of cardiac contractility and LVSP. Progranulin significantly reduced myocyte apoptosis, , and tissue edema, and was highly expressed in cardiac tissue following MI/R injury. The cardioprotective effect of progranulin was reduced by blocking the P13K/Akt signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS In the rat model of acute MI/R injury, progranulin had a protective effect on cardiac function and morphology, associated with activation of the P13K/Akt signaling pathway. The mechanisms of the anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and inotropic effects of progranulin in the setting of acute MI/R injury require further in vivo studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696504>The efficacy of a mix of three probiotic strains in reducing abdominal pain and inflammatory biomarkers in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis.</a></h2><p>Acute Uncomplicated Diverticulitis (AUD) is defined as the  of a colon diverticulum, often involving colic wall and pericolic fat. Conventional treatment of AUD includes antibiotics, usually ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, fasting, and fluid therapy. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a mix of three probiotic strains (Bifidobacterium lactis LA 304, Lactobacillus salivarius LA 302, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA 201; Lactibiane Iki®, Biocure [PiLeJe Groupe], Italy/PiLeJe Laboratoire, France) in association with conventional antibiotics in treating AUD compared to conventional antibiotics used alone.We enrolled 84 (25M/59F mean age 61.5 ± 11.5 years) consecutive patients who came to the Emergency Department of the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli - IRCCS, Rome, Italy, with a diagnosis of AUD confirmed by CT scan. After routine blood test and dosage of C-reactive protein (C-RP), patients were randomly divided into two groups: Probiotic group (42 patients, 10M/32F mean age 32.23 ± 10.3 years) was treated with ciprofloxacin 400 mg twice a day and metronidazole 500 mg three times a day for one week and simultaneously supplemented with the probiotic mix, 1 sachet twice a day for 10 days. Control group (42 patients, 15M/27F mean age 59.01 ± 11.3 years) received the same antibiotic treatment without the probiotic mix. All patients filled a daily Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for assessment of abdominal pain, with a range value from 0 (asymptomatic) to 10, and CRP value was determined on admission and at discharge.As regards abdominal pain, on Day 3, Group A showed a significant decrease of 4.06 points (51.4%) in VAS score compared to a decrease of 2.79 points (34.9%) in Group B. On Day 5 the decrease was of 6.3 points (80%) in Group A and of 4.85 points (61%) in Group B. VAS score was reduced by 7.59 points (96%) in Group A and 6.1 points (76%) in Group B on Day 7 +, and by 7.8 points (99%) in Group A and 7.2 points (90%) in Group B on Day 10. About , Group A showed a decrease in C-RP value of 64%, compared to a decrease of only 35% in Group B. We also observed that the duration of hospitalization was significantly shorter for patients in Group A: 89 h (3.7 days) in Group A vs. 101 h (4.2 days) in Group B (p=0.03).Our results indicated showed that the supplement with the probiotic mix of Bifidobacterium lactis LA 304, Lactobacillus salivarius LA 302, and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA 201 in combination with the standard antibiotic therapy for AUD reduced abdominal pain and  significantly more than antibiotic treatment used alone. These findings could be due to the anti-inflammatory activity of the probiotic mix.

The male germ cell-associated protein SSX2 is ectopically expressed in many types of cancer and is functionally involved in regulating chromatin structure and supporting cell proliferation. Similar to many well-characterized oncogenes, SSX2 has the ability to induce senescence in cells. In this study, we performed a functional genetic screen to identify proteins implicated in SSX2-induced senescence and identified several subunits of the Mediator complex, which is central in regulating RNA polymerase-mediated transcription. Further experiments showed that reduced levels of MED1, MED4, and MED14 perturbed the development of senescence in SSX2-expressing cells. In contrast, knockdown of MED1 did not prevent development of B-Raf- and Epirubicin-induced senescence, suggesting that Mediator may be specifically linked to the cellular functions of SSX2 that may lead to development of senescence or be central in a SSX2-specific senescence response. Indeed, immunostaining of melanoma tumors, which often express SSX proteins, exhibited altered levels of MED1 compared to benign nevi. Similarly, RNA-seq analysis suggested that MED1, MED4, and MED14 were downregulated in some tumors, while upregulated in others. In conclusion, our study reveals the Mediator complex as essential for SSX2-induced senescence and suggests that changes in Mediator activity could be instrumental for tumorigenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695757>Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 confers erlotinib resistance via facilitating the reactive oxygen species-reactive carbonyl species metabolic pathway in lung adenocarcinomas.</a></h2><p> Acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib is a major challenge to achieve an overall clinical benefit of the targeted therapy. Recently, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) induction has been found to render lung adenocarcinomas resistant to EGFR-TKIs, and targeting ALDH1A1 becomes a novel strategy to overcome resistance. However, the molecular mechanism underlying such effect remains poorly understood.  Comprehensive assays were performed in a panel of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and xenografts that acquired resistance to erlotinib. Cancer phenotype was evaluated by cell viability, apoptosis, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition analysis , tumorsphere formation analysis , and tumor growth and dissemination analysis . Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive carbonyl species (RCS) were detected based on fluorescent oxidation indicator and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, respectively. Protein target was suppressed by RNA interference and pharmacological inhibition or ecto-overexpressed by lentivirus-based cloning. Gene promoter activity was measured by dual-luciferase reporting assay.  Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of ALDH1A1 overcame erlotinib resistance  and . ALDH1A1 overexpression was sufficient to induce erlotinib resistance. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated lower ROS-RCS levels in ALDH1A1-addicted, erlotinib-resistant cells; in line with this, key enzymes for metabolizing ROS and RCS, SOD2 and GPX4, respectively, were upregulated in these cells. Knockdown of SOD2 or GPX4 re-sensitized the resistant cells to erlotinib and the effect was abrogated by ROS-RCS scavenging and mimicked by ROS-RCS induction. The ALDH1A1 overexpressed cells, though resisted erlotinib, were more sensitive to SOD2 or GPX4 knockdown. The ALDH1A1 effect on erlotinib resistance was abrogated by ROS-RCS induction and mimicked by ROS-RCS scavenging. Detection of GPX4 and SOD2 expression and analysis of promoter activities of GPX4 and SOD2 under the condition of suppression or overexpression of ALDH1A1 demonstrated that the RCS-ROS-metabolic pathway was controlled by the ALDH1A1-GPX4-SOD2 axis. The ROS-RCS metabolic dependence mechanism in ALDH1A1-induced resistance was confirmed . Analysis of public databases showed that in patients undergoing chemotherapy, those with high co-expression of ALDH1A1, GPX4, and SOD2 had a lower probability of survival.  ALDH1A1 confers erlotinib resistance by facilitating the ROS-RCS metabolic pathway. ALDH1A1-induced upregulation of SOD2 and GPX4, as well as ALDH1A1 itself, mitigated erlotinib-induced oxidative and carbonyl stress, and imparted the TKI resistance. The elucidation of previously unrecognized metabolic mechanism underlying erlotinib resistance provides new insight into the biology of molecular targeted therapies and help to design improved pharmacological strategies to overcome the drug resistance.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693858>Selective Liposomal Transport through Blood Brain Barrier Disruption in Ischemic Stroke Reveals Two Distinct Therapeutic Opportunities.</a></h2><p>The development of effective therapies for stroke continues to face repeated translational failures. Brain endothelial cells form paracellular and transcellular barriers to many blood-borne therapies, and the development of efficient delivery strategies is highly warranted. Here, in a mouse model of stroke, we show selective recruitment of clinically used liposomes into the ischemic brain that correlates with biphasic blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. Intravenous administration of liposomes into mice exposed to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion took place at early (0.5 and 4 h) and delayed (24 and 48 h) time points, covering different phases of BBB disruption after stroke. Using a combination of  real-time imaging and histological analysis we show that selective liposomal brain accumulation coincides with biphasic enhancement in transcellular transport followed by a delayed impairment to the paracellular barrier. This process precedes neurological damage in the acute phase and maintains long-term liposomal colocalization within the neurovascular unit, which could have great potential for neuroprotection. Levels of liposomal uptake by glial cells are similarly selectively enhanced in the ischemic region late after experimental stroke (2-3 days), highlighting their potential for blocking delayed inflammatory responses or shifting the polarization of microglia/macrophages toward brain repair. These findings demonstrate the capability of liposomes to maximize selective translocation into the brain after stroke and identify two windows for therapeutic manipulation. This emphasizes the benefits of selective drug delivery for efficient tailoring of stroke treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695352>Circulating syndecan-1 as a novel biomarker relates to lung function, systemic , and exacerbation in COPD.</a></h2><p>Patients with COPD often show increased systemic  which is associated with lower functional status, greater exacerbation risk, and worse clinical outcomes. Syndecans (SDCs), a family of transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), have been found to involve in inflammatory processes in many chronic inflammatory diseases. The aim of this preliminary clinical study was to investigate the possible association between two SDCs, SDC-1 and SDC-4, with lung function, systemic , and risk of exacerbations in COPD patients.Serum SDC-1 and SDC-4 levels were measured in 101 COPD patients and 57 health controls. Correlations between SDCs and other parameters were analyzed using Spearsman's rho. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the threshold value in differentiating disease status.Although both serum SDC-1 and SDC-4 showed a downward trend in COPD patients, only SDC-1 levels were correlated positively with the ratio of FEV1/FVC and parameters of small airway obstruction. Besides, SDC-1 but not SDC-4, was negatively correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP) in COPD patients and downregulated in frequent exacerbators (FEs) of COPD. Using a cutoff value of 2.08 ng/mL, the sensitivity and specificity of SDC-1 to differentiate FE were 44% and 93.4%, respectively.In conclusion, circulating SDC-1 may be a novel inflammatory biomarker associated with lung function and systemic  in patients with COPD, which could also be useful to identify the risk of COPD exacerbation. Further studies should be performed to clarify the influences of SDC-1 on the pathogenesis and outcomes of COPD.© 2019 Li et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694702>Early rheumatoid arthritis is characterised by a distinct and transient synovial fluid cytokine profile of T cell and stromal cell origin.</a></h2><p>A study by Raza et al., published in this journal in 2005, identified that RA patients, within 3 months of symptom onset, had a synovial fluid cytokine profile that was distinct from that of patients with other inflammatory arthritides of similarly short duration.

Here, we reveal that platelets induce monocyte migration and recruitment into atherosclerotic plaques, resulting in plaque platelet-macrophage aggregates. In   mice fed a Western diet, platelet depletion decreased plaque size and necrotic area and attenuated macrophage accumulation.

Western blot analysis showed CA-I and CA-II as the major isoforms and CA-IV as a minor one in the colon, and they all are expressed as minor isoforms in the ileum. Co-immunoprecipitation and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed colocalization of NHE-1 with CA-I and CA-II, but not with CA-IV.

However, these findings were observed in a small sized-study comparing the prognostic value of these scores in patients after curative resection for HCC.We retrospectively analyzed 717 consecutive patients with HCC who underwent curative liver resection at our hospital. Clinicopathological variables including preoperative -based prognostic scores, such as neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score, prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and Glasgow prognostic score (GPS) were analyzed. The prognostic value of these scores were compared by the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analyses.The integrate area under the curve of PNI, CONUT score, NLR, PLR, and GPS were 0.6751; 0.6435; 0.5845; 0.5276; 0.5351, for over-all survival (OS) respectively, and, 0.5955; 0.5694; 0.4692; 0.4873; 0.5272, for disease-free survival (DFS) respectively. Multivariate analyses for prognosis factor in HCC patients showed that PNI was an independent predictor of both OS (HR 0.91, p<0.001) and DFS (HR 0.94, p<0.001). When the patients were divided into high and low PNI groups, the patients in low PNI group had significant poorer OS (p<0.001) and DFS (p<0.001) even after background factors were matched between these two groups.PNI is superior to CONUT score, NLR, PLR, or GPS as a predictor of OS and RFS in patients with HCC who underwent curative hepatic resection.This article is protected by copyright.

Epidemiological studies have highlighted that exposure to antibiotic therapy influences the probability of response to ICPI and predict for shorter patient survival across malignancies. Whilst a number of studies have reproducibly documented the detrimental effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics, the immune-biologic mechanisms underlying the association with outcome are poorly understood.

Prospective studies are required to validate antibiotic-mediated gut perturbations as a mechanism of ICPI refractoriness and guide the development of strategies to overcome this barrier to an effective delivery of anti-cancer immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692563>Orbital cellulitis clinically mimicking rhabdomyosarcoma.</a></h2><p>Proptosis in children with acute-onset accompanied by signs of  is commonly caused by orbital cellulitis, however, the possibility of rhabdomyosarcoma should always be considered by the clinician.

Here, we demonstrate that hepatocytes can modulate T cell populations through engulfment of live CD4 lymphocytes. We term this phenomenon enclysis to reflect the specific enclosure of CD4 T cells in hepatocytes. Enclysis is selective for CD4 but not CD8 cells, independent of antigen-specific activation, and occurs in human hepatocytes in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) facilitates T cell early adhesion and internalization, whereas hepatocytes form membrane lamellipodia or blebs to mediate engulfment. T cell internalization is unaffected by wortmannin and Rho kinase inhibition. Hepatocytes engulf Treg cells more efficiently than non-Treg cells, but Treg cell-containing vesicles preferentially acidify overnight. Thus, enclysis is a biological process with potential effects on immunomodulation and opens a new field for research to fully understand CD4 T cell dynamics in liver .Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Exposure to toxic particles and gases, including cigarette smoke, is the main risk factor for COPD. Next to smoking cessation, current treatment strategies of COPD aim to improve symptoms and prevent exacerbations, yet there is no disease modifying treatment. The biggest drawback of today's COPD treatment regime is the 'one size fits all' pharmacological intervention, mainly based on disease severity and symptoms and not the individual's disease pathology. To halt the worrying increase in the burden of COPD, disease management needs to be advanced with a focus on personalized treatment. The main pathological feature of COPD includes a chronic and abnormal inflammatory response within the lungs which results in airway and alveolar changes in the lung as reflected by (small) airways disease and emphysema. Here we discuss recent developments related to the abnormal inflammatory response, extracellular matrix and age-related changes, structural changes in the small airways, and the role of sex-related differences, that are all relevant to explain the individual differences in disease pathology of COPD and improve disease endotyping. Furthermore, we will discuss the most recent developments of new treatment strategies using biologicals to target specific pathological features or disease endotypes of COPD.

Although MetS affects one third of American adults, its pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. Tyramine, a derivative of tyrosine, has been shown to act as a catecholamine releasing agent in the human body. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of tyramine as an early biomarker for nascent MetS without the confounding of T2DM, ASCVD or smoking. Patients and methods This was an exploratory study of 28 patients with nascent MetS and 20 matched controls carried out in 2018. Metabolites were evaluated from patient's frozen early morning urine samples and were correlated with biomarkers of  and adipokines. They were assayed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Western Metabolomics Center using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and standardized to urinary creatinine. All patients had normal hepatic and renal function. Results Tyramine concentrations were significantly reduced in patients with MetS compared to controls, p = 0.0009. In addition, tyramine was significantly inversely correlated with multiple biomarkers of  and cardiometabolic risk factors such as RBP4, monocyte TLR-4 abundance and P38MAPKinase activity, body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure (BP) (both systolic and diastolic). Conclusion In conclusion, low levels of tyramine could contribute to the proinflammatorty state of MetS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693325>Pulsed Electron Avalanche Knife (PEAK) PlasmaBlade versus Traditional Electrocautery for Surgery: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness [Internet].</a></h2><p>Electrosurgical instruments are some of the most often used tools at the surgeon’s disposal. Benefits thought to be associated with these devices range from decreased post-operative pain and intraoperative bleeding, increased surgical speed, and reduced risk of post-surgical hemorrhage. Traditional electrocautery (EC) applies radiofrequency (RF) alternating current to generate high current density at the cutting blade tip and tissue interface resulting in extreme resistive heating of local tissue. that provides effective cutting and coagulation due to instantaneous boiling of fluid and tissue vaporization. The device operates at temperatures of between 300C–350C and the generated heat provides effective cutting and coagulation due to instantaneous boiling of fluid and tissue vaporization. It has been reported that the high temperature of the EC procedure is associated with some drawbacks, such as significant thermal damage to incised tissues, reduced surgical precision compared with a scalpel, potential injury to adjacent structures, and delayed wound healing. The cauterized surface area also increases subsequent  and fluid sequestration into newly created tissue planes, resulting in seroma formation and increased risk of post-operative complications, such as infection. Pulsed-electron avalanche knife (PEAK) PlasmaBlade is a relatively new electrosurgical technology developed to minimize the collateral tissue damage caused by higher-heat instruments such as EC. It uses high-intensity RF pulses to create electrical plasma along the edge of a thin, flat, insulated electrode. The PEAK PlasmaBlade (PPB) system uses a lower amount of energy translating into operating temperatures of about 40–140 °C, with a corresponding reduction in heat transfer and reduction in depth of thermal damage to adjacent tissues of approximately 50–90%. The PPB devices are available in several models designed for specific applications and are intended for tissue cutting and coagulation during general surgery. The objective of this report is to summarize the evidence regarding the comparative clinical effectiveness of PPB soft tissue dissection devices versus traditional EC for surgery and the cost-effectiveness of PPB use for surgery.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693324>Biologics versus Immunomodulators for the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis: A Review of Comparative Clinical Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness [Internet].</a></h2><p>INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a disease involving  conditions located in colon and small intestines. Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are two primary types of IBD with different characteristics. UC is a mucosal disease that often affects the rectum and all or part of the colon. Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish UC and CD clinically. The symptoms commonly seen in the patients with UC include diarrhea, rectal bleeding, tenesmus, passage of mucus, and crampy abdominal pain. The  may cause major consequences, particularly a fibrostenotic obstructing pattern or a penetrating fistulous pattern. Depending on disease severity, the options of conventional treatment for IBD include 5-aminosalicylic acid agents, glucocorticoids, antibiotics, and immunomodulators. Immunomodulators include azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, and cyclosporine, and modify the activities of the immune system. The use of immunomodulators are associated with minor or severe adverse events, such as headache, infection, and certain cancers. Due to such risks, the use of immunomodulators needs to be closely monitored. Conventionally, a “step-up” treatment strategy usually include a sequential use of aminosalicylates, steroids, immunomodulators, and finally biologics. Medications such as 5-aminosalicylic acids or prednisolone are tried first. Biologics or pharmacological immunomodulators are particularly useful when patients are not responsive to steroids for induction or relapse prevention. BIOLOGICS: Recent advances in IBD treatment include biologics (also called biologic agents or biologic therapies), particularly for patients unresponsive to conventional therapy. Biologics are protein-based molecules that can block  in several immune-related diseases. The first biologic approved for IBD is infliximab, a chimeric immunoglobulin (IgG)1 antibody against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. The usual dose of infliximab is to repeat infusion 5mg/kg every eight weeks. Infliximab was approved by Health Canada to treat rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, CD, fistulizing Crohn disease (FCD), and UC. Currently, three types of biologics are approved for the treatment of one or both primary types of IBD: anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab), anti-integrin agents (vedolizumab) and anti-interleukin (IL) 12/23 IgG1 kappa agents (ustekinumab). PLACE IN THERAPY: Health Canada has approved several biologics or biosimilars for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in patients without adequate response to conventional therapy, including infliximab and vedolizumab. Although, infliximab and other biologics are often reserved for patients unresponsive to conventional therapy, some practitioners argue that early adoption of biologics or immunomodulators may be beneficial to patients with IBD. The benefits of early adoption may include avoiding toxic effects of immunomodulators and fewer adverse effects related to conventional therapy. It is uncertain whether early adoption of biologics or immunomodulators may be beneficial to patients with UC. This study aims to review the literature and understand the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of biologics and immunomodulators among UC patients naïve to both types of drugs.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693898>The Splicing Factor hnRNP M Is a Critical Regulator of Innate Immune Gene Expression in Macrophages.</a></h2><p>While transcriptional control of innate immune gene expression is well characterized, almost nothing is known about how pre-mRNA splicing decisions influence, or are influenced by, macrophage activation. Here, we demonstrate that the splicing factor hnRNP M is a critical repressor of innate immune gene expression and that its function is regulated by pathogen sensing cascades. Loss of hnRNP M led to hyperinduction of a unique regulon of inflammatory and antimicrobial genes following diverse innate immune stimuli. While mutating specific serines on hnRNP M had little effect on its ability to control pre-mRNA splicing or transcript levels of housekeeping genes in resting macrophages, it greatly impacted the protein's ability to dampen induction of specific innate immune transcripts following pathogen sensing. These data reveal a previously unappreciated role for pattern recognition receptor signaling in controlling splicing factor phosphorylation and establish pre-mRNA splicing as a critical regulatory node in defining innate immune outcomes.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

The NLRP inflammasomes have been shown to be expressed in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) and human dermal fibroblasts (HDF). NLRP inflammasomes in keratinocytes are interesting as these skin cells are the first living cells in the skin to contact external exogenous threats such as UV energy, chemicals, physical trauma, and bacteria and viruses. Activation of the NLRP Inflammasomes by exogenous threats results in the release of active Caspase-1 (ACasp-1), a key protease enzyme, which targets inactive forms of IL-1β, IL-18 as well as IL-1α and IL-33.This article discusses efforts to examine the release of active Caspase-1 from NHEKs activated by various exogenous threats including UVB energy, ATP, Nigericin and Urban Dust. The work further examines if, after inflammasome activation and Caspase-1 release, certain naturally derived botanical ingredients known to have anti-inflammatory effects can function to inhibit upregulation of active Caspase-1.NHEK were treated with various doses of UVB, ATP and Nigericin and with a single dose of Urban Dust. ACasp-1 expression was measured after 3 and 20 hours using the Promega Caspase Glo-1 bioluminescent assay. After confirmation that 60 mJ/cm of UVB and 5mM of ATP were effective to activate NHEK ACasp-1 release after 20 hrs, these conditions were employed to examine the influence of three botanical blends of ingredients on their ability to inhibit ACasp-1 expression.Initial results demonstrate that NHEKs can be activated to release active Caspase-1 by ATP and UVB, but not by Nigericin or Urban Dust. In addition, it was unexpectedly found that, while ATP and UVB activated NHEKs, the release of ACasp-1-did not happen within the first 3 hours after exposure but did become significant after 20 hours. Additional results indicate that a blend of polysaccharides and two blends of antioxidants, one oil-soluble and the other water-soluble, known for their anti-inflammatory effects, can reduce expression of active Caspase-1 in activated NHEKs when applied extracellularly.Expression of NLRP activated release of ACasp-1 was found to be influenced by UVB and ATP but not by Nigericin or Urban Dust. The effects were also time dependent. Several botanical extract blends were found to reduce ACasp-1 expression in previously activated NHEKs. Links between these inflammatory effects and processes of cellular inflammaging are discussed.© 2019 Gruber and Holtz.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693873>Endothelial microvesicles induced by physiological cyclic stretch inhibit ICAM1-Dependent leukocyte adhesion.</a></h2><p>Physiological cyclic stretch (CS), caused by artery deformation following blood pressure, plays important roles in the homeostasis of endothelial cells (ECs). Here, we detected the effect of physiological CS on endothelial microvesicles (EMVs) and their roles in leukocyte recruitment to ECs, which is a crucial event in EC . The results showed compared with the static treatment, pretreatment of 5%-CS-derived EMVs with ECs significantly decreased the adherence level of leukocytes. Comparative proteomic analysis revealed 373 proteins differentially expressed between static-derived and 5%-CS-derived EMVs, in which 314 proteins were uniquely identified in static-derived EMVs, 34 proteins uniquely in 5%-CS-derived EMVs, and 25 proteins showed obvious differences. Based on the proteomic data, Ingenuity Pathways Analysis predicted intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) in EMVs might be the potential molecule involved in EC-leukocyte adhesion. Western blot and flow cytometry analyses confirmed the significant decrease of ICAM1 in 5%-CS-derived EMVs, which subsequently inhibited the phosphorylation of VE-cadherin at Tyr731 in target ECs. Moreover, leukocyte adhesion was obviously decreased after pretreatment with ICAM1 neutralizing antibody. Our present research suggested that physiological stretch changes the components of EMVs, which in turn inhibits leukocyte adhesion. ICAM1 expressed on CS-induced EMVs may play an important role in maintaining EC homeostasis.Copyright © 2019.

Proteomic profiling of patient fluids may help identify novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers associated with AD pathology. Here, we applied the Olink™ ProSeek immunoassay to measure 270 CSF and plasma proteins across 415 Aβ- negative cognitively normal individuals (Aβ- CN), 142 Aβ-positive CN (Aβ+ CN), 50 Aβ- mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, 75 Aβ+ MCI patients, and 161 Aβ+ AD patients from the Swedish BioFINDER study. A validation cohort included 59 Aβ- CN, 23 Aβ- + CN, 44 Aβ- MCI and 53 Aβ+ MCI. To compare protein concentrations in patients versus controls, we applied multiple linear regressions adjusting for age, gender, medications, smoking and mean subject-level protein concentration, and corrected findings for false discovery rate (FDR, q < 0.05). We identified, and replicated, altered levels of ten CSF proteins in Aβ+ individuals, including CHIT1, SMOC2, MMP-10, LDLR, CD200, EIF4EBP1, ALCAM, RGMB, tPA and STAMBP (- 0.14 < d < 1.16; q < 0.05).

The cumulative exposure of the general population may therefore reach critical and potentially hazardous levels. Due to data gaps on AgNP effects in humans, it is urgent to further evaluate their possible toxicity, particularly in vulnerable systems like the nervous one. As AgNPs may cross the blood brain and placental barriers, this study evaluated the in vitro effect of different AgNPs on neuronal precursor cells. For this purpose, 10 nm-sized AgNPs were stabilized with five different coating agents rendering a neutral, positive and negative surface charge. Murine neural stem cells (mNSCs) were used as cellular model to test AgNP neurotoxicity by evaluating the range of toxicity endpoints including cellular viability, apoptosis induction, oxidative stress response, cellular and mitochondrial membrane damages, DNA damage,  response, and neural stem cell regulation. Our results clearly showed that the neurotoxic potential of AgNPs was not dependent on their surface charge or coating agents used for their surface stabilization.

Exosomes are an important paracrine factor that can be used as a direct therapeutic agent. However, the use of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (BMSC-Exos) in the treatment of acute liver failure has not been reported.Here, we established a model of hepatocyte injury and apoptosis induced by D-galactosamine and lipopolysaccharide (D-GalN/LPS) to study the protective effect of BMSC-Exos on hepatocyte apoptosis, and further explored its protective mechanism.BMSC-Exos was identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and Western blot. Laser confocal microscopy was used to observe the uptake of Dil-Exos by hepatocytes. D-GalN/LPS-induced primary hepatocytes were pretreated with BMSC-Exos in vitro, and then the cells were harvested. The apoptosis of hepatocytes was observed by TUNEL staining, flow cytometry and Western blot. Electron microscopy and mRFP-GFP-LC3 and Western blot was used to observe autophagy.BMSC-Exos increased the expression of autophagy marker proteins LC3 and Beclin-1 and promoted the formation of autophagosomes. After BMSC-Exos treatment, the expression levels of the proapoptotic proteins Bax and cleaved caspase-3 were significantly decreased, while the expression level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was upregulated. However, when the autophagy inhibitor 3MA was present, the effect of BMSC-Exos on inhibiting apoptosis was significantly reversed.Our results showed for the first time that BMSC-Exos had the potential to reduce hepatocyte apoptosis after acute liver failure.

Besides, Rut inhibited neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting the activation of caspase 3 and the expression of Bax. In addition, Rut alleviated the inflammatory response and oxidative stress caused by CI/R through inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6 and IL-1β), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and ROS, and increased the levels of anti-inflammatory factors (IL-4 and IL-10) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Biochemically, Western blot analyses showed that Rut inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and promoted the expression of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway-related proteins (Nrf2, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and NAD (P) H-quinone oxidoreductase 1) in a dose-dependent manner.

Whilst the effects of nicotine are relatively well-understood, more information is needed regarding the potential biological effects of the other e-liquid constituents. This is a serious concern, because e-liquids are available in over 7,000 distinct flavors. We have previously demonstrated that many e-liquids affect cell growth/viability through an unknown mechanism. Since Ca is a ubiquitous second messenger that regulates cell growth, we therefore characterized the effects of e-liquids on cellular Ca homeostasis. To better understand the extent of this effect, we screened e-liquids for their ability to alter cytosolic Ca levels and found that 42/100 flavored e-liquids elicited a cellular Ca response.

Another objective was to develop a scoring rubric to help clinicians make decisions on whether or not certain ultasonographic findings of the spleen warrant evaluation by fine-needle cytology.One-hundred twenty-five adult client-owned dogs with ultrasonographically identified splenic nodules, heterogeneous parenchyma, or both.Medical records were retrospectively searched for ultrasound-guided splenic fine-needle cytology reports. Ultrasonographic images were assessed for nodule number, size, echogenicity and distal enhancement, degree of splenic heterogeneity, and peritoneal fluid. Dogs were divided into 2 groups: those with clinically important or clinically irrelevant cytologic findings. Potentially useful and discriminatory ultrasonographic findings were identified by statistical analysis, and the most useful findings were used to generate the scoring rubric.The clinically important group included 25 of 125 dogs (22 malignancies, 3 suppurative ). Splenic nodules 1-2 cm in diameter, peritoneal fluid, and >1 targetoid nodule were associated with clinically important cytologic findings. Receiver operator characteristic analysis showed that the scoring rubric was useful for identifying dogs in the clinically important group.Splenic fine-needle cytologic findings identified a clinically relevant diagnosis in 20% of dogs, and larger nodule size, number of targetoid lesions, and presence of peritoneal fluid increase the likelihood of detection of clinically important disease.© 2019 The Authors.

Cross-linking of glycation products to proteins results in the formation of cross-linked proteins that inhibit the normal functioning of the cell. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are risk molecules for the cell aging process. These ends products are increasingly synthesized in diabetes and are essentially responsible for diabetic complications. They accumulate in the extracellular matrix and bind to receptors (receptor of AGE [RAGE]) to generate oxidative stress and . particularly in the cardiovascular system. Treatment methods targeting the AGE system may be of clinical importance in reducing and preventing the complications induced by AGEs in diabetes and old age. The AGE cross-link breaker alagebrium (a thiazolium derivative) is the most studied anti-AGE compound in the clinical field. Phase III clinical studies with alagebrium have been successfully conducted, and this molecule has positive effects on cardiovascular hypertrophy, diabetes, hypertension, vascular sclerotic pathologies, and similar processes. However, the mechanism is still not fully understood. The primary mechanism is that alagebrium removes newly formed AGEs by chemically separating α-dicarbonyl carbon-carbon bonds formed in cross-linked structures. However, it is also reported that alagebrium is a methylglyoxal effective inhibitor. It is not yet clear whether alagebrium inhibits copper-catalyzed ascorbic acid oxidation through metal chelation or destruction of the AGEs. It is not known whether alagebrium has a direct association with RAGEs. The safety profile is favorably in humans, and studies have been terminated due to financial insufficiency and inability to license as a drug.©Copyright 2019 by the Atatürk University School of Medicine - Available online at www.eurasianjmed.com.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692935>Neutropenic enterocolitis: A clinico-pathological review.</a></h2><p>Neutropenic enterocolitis (NE) is a predominantly cecum-based disease with high mortality seen in patients post chemotherapy. The pathogenesis of NE is poorly understood and probably multifactorial involving mucosal injury, neutropenia, and impaired host defense to intestinal organisms. The clinical presentation is characterized as ileocolonic  and bowel wall thickening in patients with neutropenia, fever, and abdominal pain. The pathological features of NE include patchy necrosis, hemorrhage, ulcer, edema, perforation, infiltrating organisms, and characteristically, depletion of inflammatory cells (neutrophils). NE should always be considered as a possible diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients, especially those receiving chemotherapy. High clinical and histological diagnostic discordance rate exists. High index of clinical suspicion and prompt appropriate personalized management are essential to achieve a lower mortality rate.©The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Any condition (environmental, pharmacological/toxicological, physical, or neuro-humoral) that changes the vascular endothelium has great consequences for the organism's wellness and on the outcome and evolution of severe cardiovascular pathologies. Thus, knowledge of the mechanisms, both endogenous and external, that affect endothelial dysfunction is pivotal to preventing and treating these disorders. In recent decades, significant attention has been focused on gut microbiota and how these symbiotic microorganisms can influence host health and disease development. Indeed, dysbiosis has been reported to be at the base of a range of different pathologies, including pathologies of the cardiovascular system. The study of the mechanism underlying this relationship has led to the identification of a series of metabolites (released by gut bacteria) that exert different effects on all the components of the vascular system, and in particular on endothelial cells. The imbalance of factors promoting or blunting endothelial cell viability and function and angiogenesis seems to be a potential target for the development of new therapeutic interventions. This review highlights the circulating factors identified to date, either directly produced by gut microbes or resulting from the metabolism of diet derivatives as polyphenols.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692289>In-vitro evaluation of a ciprofloxacin and azithromycin sinus stent for Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms.</a></h2><p>Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by persistent  and bacterial infection. Ciprofloxacin and azithromycin are commonly prescribed antibiotics for CRS, but the ability to provide targeted release in the sinuses could mitigate side effects and improve drug concentrations at the infected site. This study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the novel ciprofloxacin-azithromycin sinus stent (CASS) in vitro.The CASS was created by coating ciprofloxacin (hydrophilic, inner layer) and azithromycin (hydrophobic, outer layer) onto a biodegradable poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) stent. In-vitro evaluation included: (1) assessment of drug-coating stability within the stent using scanning electron microscopy (SEM); (2) determination of ciprofloxacin and azithromycin release kinetics; and (3) assessment of anti-biofilm activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.The ciprofloxacin nanoparticle suspension in the inner layer was confirmed by zeta potential. Both ciprofloxacin (60 µg) and azithromycin (3 mg) were uniformly coated on the surface of the PLLA stents. The CASS showed ciprofloxacin/azithromycin sustained release patterns, with 80.55 ± 11.61% of ciprofloxacin and 93.85 ± 6.9% of azithromycin released by 28 days. The CASS also significantly reduced P aeruginosa biofilm mass compared with bare stents and controls (relative optical density units at 590-nm optical density: CASS, 0.037 ± 0.006; bare stent, 0.911 ± 0.015; control, 1.000 ± 0.000; p < 0.001; n = 3).The CASS maintains a uniform coating and sustained delivery of ciprofloxacin and azithromycin, providing anti-biofilm activities against P aeruginosa.

EDPs may be detected in the serum of healthy subjects or people who suffered a stroke. Moreover, recent evidence suggests a potential role of inflammatory mechanisms in neurological conditions, which are usually not categorized as inflammatory. Therefore, the present in vitro study was conducted to investigate the impact of the VGVAPG peptide on the activation of inflammatory process in mouse primary astrocytes, which were maintained in phenol red-free DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were exposed to VGVAPG or VVGPGA peptides for 24 and 48 h; this was followed by the determination of the activity of caspase-1 and levels of SOD, CAT, PPARγ, NF-κB, IL-1β, and IL-1βR1. Furthermore, rosiglitazone-a PPARγ agonist-was applied. Our study pioneered the finding that the VGVAPG peptide increases caspase-1 activity in astrocytes in vitro. The VGVAPG peptide simultaneously decreases the release of IL-1β into the cell-culture medium from astrocytes. The ELISA method revealed that the VGVAPG peptide increases the protein expression of SOD1 whereas it decreases the expression of IL-1βR1, CAT, and NF-κB. Therefore, the available data suggest that the VGVAPG peptide (concentration 10 nM) synergistically acts with agonists of PPARγ in mouse astrocytes. However, given the lack of sufficient data to explain the molecular mechanism of action of the VGVAPG peptide in the nervous system, more studies in this area are necessary.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694163>Lysozyme-Induced Transcriptional Regulation of TNF-α Pathway Genes in Cells of the Monocyte Lineage.</a></h2><p>Lysozyme is one of the most important anti-bacterial effectors in the innate immune system of animals. Besides its direct antibacterial enzymatic activity, lysozyme displays other biological properties, pointing toward a significant anti-inflammatory effect, many aspects of which are still elusive. Here we investigate the perturbation of gene expression profiles induced by lysozyme in a monocyte cell line in vitro considering a perspective as broad as the whole transcriptome profiling. The results of the RNA-seq experiment show that lysozyme induces transcriptional modulation of the TNF-α/IL-1β pathway genes in U937 monocytes. The analysis of transcriptomic profiles with IPA identified a simple but robust molecular network of genes, in which the regulation trends are fully consistent with the anti-inflammatory activity of lysozyme. This study provides the first evidence in support of the anti-inflammatory action of lysozyme on the basis of transcriptomic regulation data resulting from the broad perspective of a whole-transcriptome profiling. Such important effects can be achieved with the supplementation of relatively low concentrations of lysozyme, for a short time of exposure. These new insights allow the potential of lysozyme in pharmacological applications to be better exploited.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696204>CXCR3 from chemokine receptor family correlates with immune infiltration and predicts poor survival in osteosarcoma.</a></h2><p>Chemokine receptors have a crucial role in regulating tumor mediating immunity and also implicated in the prognosis of some cancers. Here, the association between CXC chemokine receptors (CXCR2-5) and prognosis in osteosarcoma was studied.Differences between CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, and CXCR5 expression and overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses. The associations of CXCR3 expression with clinical features and the prognosis were also analyzed. The signaling pathways modulated by CXCR3 were investigated. The correlations between CXCR3 and immune infiltrates were investigated.The expression of CXCR2, CXCR4, and CXCR5 was not associated with the prognosis, but CXCR3 low expression was correlated with worse OS and EFS of osteosarcoma, especially for female, patients aged less than 15.1 years, or patients without metastasis. Low CXCR3 expression was related to tumor site and histologic response (P&lt;0.05), but not associated with other clinical characteristics. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that CXCR3 remained independently associated with the prognosis, especially for OS (HR = 3.26, 95% CI = 1.15-9.24, P = 0.026). The cell adhesion, apoptosis, metabolism, KRAS, P53, NOTCH, reactive oxygen species (ROS), PI3K/Akt/mTOR, VEGF, , and immune-related pathways such as IL-6/JAK/STAT3, TNF-α via NF-κB, Toll/NOD-like receptor, and complement were modulated by CXCR3. CXCR3 expression showed an especially positive correlation with immune infiltration of T cells CD8, macrophages M1, plasma cells, and NK cells activated.CXCR3 may be an independent risk factor for the prognosis and was most likely to benefit from immunotherapy in osteosarcoma.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695320>Novel Technique For The Management Of Macroperforation During Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty.</a></h2><p>To describe the outcomes of a case series of patients who underwent a novel technique for managing macroperforation during deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK).Nine eyes of 9 patients with advanced keratoconus who underwent DALK comprised the case series.

The main biological actions of orexins, focused on the central nervous system, are to control the sleep/wake process, appetite and feeding, energy homeostasis, drug addiction, and cognitive processes. These effects are mediated by two G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) subtypes named OX1R and OX2R. In accordance with the synergic and dynamic relationship between the nervous and immune systems, orexins also have neuroprotective and immuno-regulatory (i.e., anti-inflammatory) properties. The present review gathers recent data demonstrating that orexins may have a therapeutic potential in several pathologies with an immune component including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, narcolepsy, obesity, intestinal bowel diseases, septic shock, and cancers.Copyright © 2019 Couvineau, Voisin, Nicole, Gratio, Abad and Tan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695683>An Overview of VPAC Receptors in Rheumatoid Arthritis: Biological Role and Clinical Significance.</a></h2><p>The axis comprised by the Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) and its G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), VPAC1, and VPAC2, belong to the B1 family and signal through Gs or Gq proteins. VPAC receptors seem to preferentially interact with Gs in inflammatory cells, rather than Gq, thereby stimulating adenylate cyclase activity. cAMP is able to trigger various downstream pathways, mainly the canonical PKA pathway and the non-canonical cAMP-activated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (EPAC) pathway. Classically, the presence of VPACs has been confined to the plasma membrane; however, VPAC1 location has been described in the nuclear membrane in several cell types such as activated Th cells, where they are also functional. VPAC receptor signaling modulates a number of biological processes by tipping the balance of inflammatory mediators in macrophages and other innate immune cells, modifying the expression of TLRs, and inhibiting MMPs and the expression of adhesion molecules. Receptor signaling also downregulates coagulation factors and acute-phase proteins, promotes Th2 over Th1, stimulates Treg abundance, and finally inhibits a pathogenic Th17 profile. Thus, the VIP axis signaling regulates both the innate and adaptive immune responses in several inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex autoimmune disease that develops on a substrate of genetically susceptible individuals and under the influence of environmental factors, as well as epigenetic mechanisms. It is a heterogeneous disease with different pathogenic mechanisms and variable clinical forms between patients with the same diagnosis. The knowledge of VIP signaling generated in both animal models and human  studies can potentially be translated to clinical reality. Most recently, the beneficial effects of nanoparticles of VIP self-associated with sterically stabilized micelles have been reported in a murine model of RA. Another novel research area is beginning to define the receptors as biomarkers in RA, with their expression levels shown to be associated with the activity of the disease and patients-reported impairment. Therefore, VPAC expression together VIP genetic variants could allow patients to be stratified at the beginning of the disease with the purpose of guiding personalized treatment decisions.Copyright © 2019 Gomariz, Juarranz, Carrión, Pérez-García, Villanueva-Romero, González-Álvaro, Gutiérrez-Cañas, Lamana and Martínez.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696375>Atorvastatin Relieves Cognitive Disorder After Sepsis Through Reverting Inflammatory Cytokines, Oxidative Stress, and Neuronal Apoptosis in Hippocampus.</a></h2><p>This present research work reports the possible effects and the underlying mechanism of atorvastatin on survival rate and cognitive disorders after sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening dysfunction that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Diffuse sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture surgery (CLP) in ICR mice. 0.2 mg/kg body weight of atorvastatin was administrated intraperitoneally at 12 h before surgery. The survival of mice was calculated 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h after CLP surgery. Two weeks later, open-field test and Morris water maze test were conducted to evaluate the protective effect of atorvastatin. Inflammatory cytokines in plasma, oxidative stress parameters, number of astrocytes, and neuronal cell deaths in the CA3 region of the hippocampus were examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry. The results indicate that pretreatment with atorvastatin can increase survival percentage and improve cognitive function. Atorvastatin reversed all these alterations in parallel with a decrease in circulating levels of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-α) in plasma, inhibited the activities of oxidative stress parameters (lower TBARS levels, ratio of GSH/GSSH, and activities of SOD and CAT), enhanced the activity of citrate synthase in brain, and reduced the number of astrocytes and neuronal cell deaths in CA3 region of hippocampus. Overall, our results indicated that atorvastatin exhibited protective effects on survival rate and cognitive disorders after sepsis by inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and neuronal apoptosis in brain tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694984>Effect of red wine and its major components on periodontitis and systemic  in rats.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the influence of red wine exposure, alcohol, grape juice and resveratrol in the occurrence of spontaneous and ligature induced periodontitis as well as CRP, TNFα and IL-6 levels in Wistar rats.50 male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to 5 groups (Control, Red Wine, Grape Juice, 12% Alcohol and 0.05mg/mL Resveratrol).

Amphiregulin (AREG) can promote the lung repair process but can also lead to fibrotic remodeling. The objective of this study was to determine the role of AREG in altering recovery from environmental dust exposure in a murine  model, and  using cultured human and murine lung fibroblasts. C57BL/6 mice were intranasally exposed to swine confinement facility dust extract (DE) or saline daily for one week or allowed to recover for 3-7 days while treated with an AREG neutralizing antibody or recombinant AREG. Treatment with the anti-AREG antibody prevented resolution of DE exposure-induced airway influx of total cells, neutrophils and macrophages, and increased levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and CXCL1. Neutrophils and activated macrophages (CD11cCD11b) persisted after recovery in lung tissues of anti-AREG treated mice. In murine and human lung fibroblasts, DE induced the release of AREG and inflammatory cytokines. Fibroblast recellularization of primary human lung mesenchymal matrix scaffolds and wound closure was inhibited by DE and enhanced with recombinant AREG alone. AREG treatment rescued the DE-induced inhibitory fibroblast effects. AREG intranasal treatment for 3 days during recovery phase reduced repetitive DE-induced airway inflammatory cell influx and cytokine release. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that inhibition of AREG reduced, whereas AREG supplementation promoted the airway inflammatory recovery response following environmental bioaerosol exposure, and that AREG enhanced fibroblast function, suggesting that AREG could be targeted in agricultural workers repetitively exposed to organic dust environments to potentially prevent and/or reduce disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692098>MicroRNA-326 attenuates hepatic stellate cell activation and liver fibrosis by inhibiting TLR4 signaling.</a></h2><p>Hepatic fibrosis is a chronic inflammatory and reversible repair reaction of the liver under the continuous action of virus or various injuries.

Adult intussusception is typically secondary to tumors and idiopathic causes. Malignant tumors tend to affect the colon, while benign tumors affect the small intestine. Lipomas are the leading cause of benign tumors which cause intussusception. Conversely, adenocarcinomas are the leading cause of malignant tumors that cause intussusception.  Our case focuses on a young adult who developed intussusception secondary to a leiomyoma present near the ileocecal junction of the intestine. The treatment of intussusception caused by tumors is either surgical reduction or excision of the involved tissue. If excised, the specimens are sent to the pathology department for confirmation of the potential cause.

To investigate the mechanisms of glucose signaling in the regulation of β-cell functions, we analyzed the role of glucokinase in insulin secretion, β-cell proliferation and β-cell apoptosis, using β-cell-specific glucokinase-haploinsufficient (Gck+/-) mice and allosteric glucokinase activators (GKAs). Glucokinase-mediated glucose metabolism (1) suppresses endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced β-cell apoptosis via inducing insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) expression and expression of ER stress-related molecules, (2) promotes adaptive β-cell proliferation through activation of the Forkhead Box M1 (FoxM1)/polo-like kinase-1 (PLK1)/centromere protein-A (CENP-A) pathway, (3) induces islet  by promoting interaction of islet-derived S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8) with macrophages, (4) induces the expression of Fibulin-5 (Fbln5), an extracellular matrix protein to regulate β-cell functions, and (5) activates other unknown pathways. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have been found to possibly compensate for dysregulation of glucose metabolism in the β-cells. This review provides an update and overview of the recent advances in the study of β-cell pathophysiology and some therapeutic possibilities focusing on glucose-/glucokinase-mediated signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691802>Methylation changes in the peripheral blood of filipinos with type 2 diabetes suggest spurious transcription initiation at TXNIP.</a></h2><p>While much work has been done in associating differentially methylated positions (DMPs) to type 2 diabetes (T2D) across different populations, not much attention has been placed on identifying its possible functional consequences. We explored methylation changes in the peripheral blood of Filipinos with T2D and identified 177 associated DMPs. Most of these DMPs were associated with genes involved in metabolism,  and the cell cycle. Three of these DMPs map to the TXNIP gene body, replicating previous findings from epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of T2D. The TXNIP downmethylation coincided with increased transcription at the 3'-UTR, H3K36me3 histone markings, and Sp1 binding, suggesting spurious transcription initiation at the TXNIP 3'-UTR as a functional consequence of T2D methylation changes. We also explored potential epigenetic determinants to increased incidence of T2D in Filipino immigrants in the United States and found 3 DMPs associated with the interaction of T2D and immigration. Two of these DMPs were located near MAP 2 K7 and PRMT1, which may point towards dysregulated stress response and  as a contributing factor to T2D among Filipino immigrants.© The Author(s) 2019.

As small-bowel carcinomas associated with CD (CD-SBCs) are extremely rare, very few molecular data are available about their pathogenesis, and information about their transcriptomic profiling is lacking. We generated RNA-seq data on 13 CD-SBCs, taken from the largest well-characterized series published so far, collected by the Small Bowel Cancer Italian Consortium, and compared the tumor transcriptional signatures with the four Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS) of colorectal carcinoma by applying the "CMS classifier." CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) was evaluated using methylation-sensitive multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification. Up to 12 of 13 cancers fell within the two main subtypes exhibiting high immune and inflammatory signatures, i.e., subtypes 1 and 4. The first and predominant subset was commonly microsatellite unstable, and exhibited CIMP and high CD3+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration. Moreover, it showed increased expression of genes associated with T helper 1 and natural killer cell infiltration, as well as upregulation of apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and proteasome pathways. By contrast, cancers falling in subtype 4 showed prominent transforming growth factor-β activation and were characterized by complement-associated , matrix remodeling, cancer-associated stroma production, and angiogenesis. Parallel histologic and histochemical analysis confirmed such tumor subtyping. In conclusion, two molecular subtypes have been consistently identified in our series of CD-SBCs, a microsatellite instability-immune and a mesenchymal subtype, the former likely associated with an indolent and the latter with a worse tumor behavior.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694213>Early Hepatic Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Changes Following Western Diet in Middle Aged Rats.</a></h2><p>To assess the effect of 4 weeks of high fat-high fructose feeding on whole body composition, energy balance, specific markers of oxidative stress and , and insulin sensitivity in the liver of middle-aged rats, rats (1 year) were fed a diet rich in saturated fatty acids and fructose (HFF rats), mimicking the "Western diet", and compared with rats of the same age that were fed a low fat diet (LF rats). HFF rats exhibited a significant increase in the gain of body weight, energy, and lipids compared to LF rats. HFF rats also showed hepatic insulin resistance, together with an increase in plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Hepatic lipids, triglycerides and cholesterol were higher in HFF rats, while a significant decrease in Stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity was found in this tissue. A marked increase in the protein amount of complex I, concomitant to a decrease in its contribution to mitochondrial respiration, was found in HFF rats. Lipid peroxidation and Nitro-Tyrosine content, taken as markers of oxidative stress, as well as NADPH oxidase activity, were significantly higher in HFF rats, while the antioxidant enzyme catalase decreased in these rats. Myeloperoxidase activity and lipocalin content increased, while peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma decreased in HFF rats. The present results provide evidence that middle-aged rats show susceptibility to a short-term "Western diet", exhibiting altered redox homeostasis, insulin resistance, and early mitochondrial alterations in the liver. Therefore, this type of dietary habits should be drastically limited to pursue a "healthy aging".</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691800>A non-coding genetic variant associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm alters ERG gene regulation.</a></h2><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a major cause of sudden death in the elderly. While AAA has some overlapping genetic and environmental risk factors with atherosclerosis, there are substantial differences, and AAA-specific medication is lacking. A recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies has identified four novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) specifically associated with AAA. Here, we investigated the gene regulatory function for one of four non-coding SNPs associated with AAA, rs2836411, which is located in an intron of the ERG gene. Rs2836411 resides within a > 70-kb super-enhancer that has high levels of H3K27ac and H3K4me1 in vascular endothelial and haematopoietic cell types. Enhancer luciferase assays in cell lines showed that the risk allele significantly alters enhancer activity. The risk allele also correlates with reduced ERG expression in aortic and other vascular tissues. To identify whether rs2836411 directly contacts the promoters of ERG and/or of genes further away, we performed allele-specific circular chromosome conformation capture sequencing. In vascular endothelial cells, which express ERG, the SNP region interacts highly within the super-enhancer, while in vascular smooth muscle cells, which do not express ERG, the interactions are distributed across a wider region that includes neighbouring genes. Furthermore, the risk allele has fewer interactions within the super-enhancer compared to the protective allele. In conclusion, our results indicate that rs2836411 likely affects ERG expression by altering enhancer activity and changing local chromatin interactions. ERG is involved in vascular development, angiogenesis, and  in atherosclerosis, therefore mechanistically, rs2836411 could contribute to AAA by modulating ERG levels.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not well understood. Herein, we investigated the potential role of RNA binding protein human antigen R (HuR) responsible for the impact of  on pterygium development. The expression of HuR and matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) in pterygium and normal conjunctiva was detected with immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The influence of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) on HuR expression and cellular distribution was determined with western blot and immunofluorescence. The pterygium fibroblast (PTF) migration was determined with scratch wound healing assay and Transwell migration assay. MMP-9 production was determined with qRT-PCR and gelatin zymography. The interaction between HuR and MMP-9 was investigated with RNP immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by RT-PCR and messenger RNA (mRNA) stability analysis. HuR and MMP-9 expression are elevated in pterygium, especially progressive pterygium compared with normal conjunctiva. IL-1β could increase the expression and nucleus-cytoplasm shuttle of HuR in cultured PTFs. HuR mediated the stimulatory effect of IL-1β on PTF migration and MMP-9 production. HuR bound to MMP-9 mRNA and in turn increased it stability. Our results suggest that posttranscriptional regulation of MMP-9 via stabilizing mRNA by HuR might contribute to the stimulatory effect of inflammatory factor IL-1β on pterygium progression. These findings shed light on the pathogenesis of pterygium and provide a promising target for adjuvant treatment of pterygium.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691948>The regulatory role of HIF-1 in tubular epithelial cells in response to kidney injury.</a></h2><p>The high sensitivity to changes in oxygen tension makes kidney vulnerable to hypoxia. Both acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease are almost always accompanied by hypoxia. Tubular epithelial cells (TECs), the dominant intrinsic cells in kidney tissue, are believed to be not only a victim in the pathological process of various kidney diseases, but also a major contributor to kidney damage. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is the main regulator of adaptive response of cells to hypoxia. Under various clinical and experimental kidney disease conditions, HIF-1 plays a pivotal role in modulating multiple cellular processes in TECs, including apoptosis, autophagy, , metabolic pattern alteration, and cell cycle arrest. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which HIF-1 regulates these cellular processes in TECs may help identify potential therapeutic targets to improve the outcome of acute kidney injury and delay the progression of chronic kidney disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696000>Endoscopic Ultrasound-assisted Diagnosis of Obscure Gastrointestinal Bleeding.</a></h2><p>Hemosuccus pancreaticus (HP) describes hemorrhage originating from the pancreatic duct.

It is characterized by intermittent episodes of wheeze, cough, chest tightness, dyspnea and backed by variable airflow limitation, airway  and airway hyper-responsiveness. Asthma severity varies uniquely between individuals and may change over time. Stratification of asthma severity is an integral part of asthma management linking appropriate treatment to establish asthma control. Precision assessment of severe asthma is crucial for monitoring the health of people with this disease. The literature suggests multiple factors that impede the assessment of severe asthma, these can be grouped into health care professional, patient and organizational related barriers. These barriers do not exist in isolation but interact and influence one another. Recognition of these barriers is necessary to promote precision in the assessment and management of severe asthma in the era of targeted therapy. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of the barriers that impede assessment in severe asthma and recommend potential strategies for overcoming these barriers. We highlight the relevance of multidimensional assessment as an ideal approach to the assessment and management of severe asthma.© 2019 Majellano et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694415>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor saxagliptin alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury via regulating the Nrf-2/HO-1 and NF-B pathways.</a></h2><p> We aimed at investigating the effects of Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor saxagliptin (Saxa) on mouse acute lung injury (ALI)-induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the potential mechanisms. Animals were divided into four groups: control, Saxa, LPS, and LPS + Saxa. Histopathology changes of lung tissues were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and periodic acid-Schiff staining. The degree of edema was determined by wet/dry ratio. The levels of oxidative stress markers and inflammatory cytokines in lung homogenate and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were detected using kits. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay was used to test apoptosis and Western blotting was applied to measure the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins. The expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways were detected by Western blotting. The results revealed that Saxa attenuated LPS-induced pathological injury and edema. Saxa decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). The contents of inflammatory cytokines were reduced in the Saxa intervention group. Saxa attenuated apoptosis accompanied by alterations in the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins. Furthermore, the expression of Nrf-2 and HO-1 were upregulated whereas phospho (p)-NF-κB p65 and phospho-inhibitory subunit of NF-κB alpha (p-IκB-α) were downregulated after Saxa treatment. These findings concluded that Saxa alleviates oxidative stress,  and apoptosis in ALI induced by LPS via modulating the Nrf-2/HO-1 and NF-κB pathways, which provides evidence for employing Saxa in ALI treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691545>Current status of diagnosis and Mesenchymal stem cells therapy for acute pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an acute gastrointestinal disorder that is the most common and requiring emergency hospitalization. Its incidence is increasing worldwide, thus increasing the burden of medical services. Approximately 20% of the patients develop moderate to severe necrotizing pancreatitis associated with pancreatic or peri-pancreatic tissue necrosis and multiple organ failure. There are many reports about the anti-inflammatory effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on pancreatitis and the repair of tissue damage. MSCs cells come from a wide range of sources, autologous MSCs come from bone marrow and allogeneic MSCs such as umbilical cord blood MSCs, placenta-derived MSCs, etc. The wide source is not only an advantage of MSCs but also a disadvantage of MSCs. Because of different cell sources and different methods of collection and preparation, it is impossible to establish a unified standard method for evaluation of efficacy. The biggest advantage of iMSCs is that it can be prepared by a standardized process, and can be prepared on a large scale, which makes it easier to commercialize. This paper reviews the present status of diagnosis and progress of MSCs therapy for AP.© 2019 The Authors.

Such disturbances not only affect cellular energy metabolism, but also alter a range of indispensable cellular homeostatic functions in which mitochondria are known to be involved. These range from cellular differentiation, cell death pathways and cellular remodeling to physical barrier function and innate immunity, all of which are known to be impacted by exposure to cigarette smoke and have been linked to COPD pathogenesis. Next to their well-established role as the first physical frontline against external insults, lung epithelial cells are immunologically active. Malfunctioning epithelial cells with defective mitochondria are unable to maintain homeostasis and respond adequately to further stress or injury, which may ultimately shape the phenotype of lung diseases. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of cigarette smoke on the development of mitochondrial dysfunction in the lung epithelium and highlight the consequences for cell function, innate immune responses, epithelial remodeling and epithelial barrier function in COPD. We also discuss the applicability and potential therapeutic value of recently proposed strategies for the restoration of mitochondrial function in the treatment of COPD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691949>Erythema papulatum centrifugum and new diagnostic criteria.</a></h2><p>Erythema papulatum centrifugum (EPC), also known as erythema papulosa semicircularis recidivans (EPSR), is distinct from eczema and other well-described figurate erythemas characterised by annular erythematous lesions.

Scarring from surgery can have a significant physical and psychological impact depending on the colour, relief, size, body location, surface area or function. Whether a procedure be life-saving such as a mastectomy, a caesarean, or a mole excision, or aesthetic such as breast reconstruction or laser treatment, patients are increasingly concerned with having an aesthetic scar outcome. With improved surgical and technological advances, elective surgery and cosmetic procedures are becoming safer and easier to perform in both hospitals and outpatient clinics. This means that more people elect to undergo procedures for an increasing number of indications on varied body areas including the face, back and limbs but also breasts, ears or genitalia. Therefore, taking the final scar outcome into consideration both before and after a procedure is becoming particularly important to ensure that controlled healing occurs with minimal discomfort. As the healing process varies from one procedure to another, and from one body part to another, each wound requires specific care. Dermatologists are well placed to manage wound healing but there remains a need for them to be involved in wound management and help surgeons better manage the wound healing process beyond wound closure and infection control. Basic skin care can play a role to protect the skin barrier function, control  and enhance natural healing. The objective of this review is to provide recommendations based on published literature for the role basic skin care plays in supporting continued wound management following invasive procedures.© 2019 Jourdan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694789>Knowledge and attitudes about burn complications in medical students.</a></h2><p>Burn injury in developing countries is a major cause of morbidity and mortality.

These simple gammaretroviruses have been studied extensively in various facets of science for nearly half a century, yet we have surprisingly little quantitative information about some of the basic features of these viral particles. These include parameters such as the genome packaging efficiency and the number of particles required for a productive infection. The reason for this knowledge gap relies primarily on the technical challenge of accurately measuring intact viral particles from infected cell supernatants. Virus infected cells are well known to release soluble viral proteins, defective viruses and extracellular vesicles (EVs) harboring viral proteins that may mimic viruses, all of which can skew virus titer quantifications. Flow virometry, also known as nanoscale flow cytometry or simply small particle flow cytometry, is an emerging analytical method enabling high throughput single-virus phenotypic characterizations. By utilizing the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) and monodisperse light scattering characteristics as discerning parameters of intact virus particles, here we analyzed the basic properties of Moloney MLV (M-MLV). We show that less than 24% of total p30 capsid protein measured in infected cell supernatants is associated with intact viruses. We calculate that about one in five M-MLV particles contain a viral RNA genome pair and that individual intact particle infectivity is about 0.4%. These findings provide new insights into the characteristics of an extensively studied prototypical retrovirus, while highlighting the benefits of flow virometry for the field of virology. Gammaretroviruses, or more specifically murine leukemia viruses (MLVs), have been a longstanding model for studying retroviruses. Although being extensively analysed and dissected for decades, several facets of MLV biology are still poorly understood. One of the primary challenges has been enumerating total intact virus particles in a sample. While several analytical methods can precisely measure virus protein amounts, MLVs are known to induce the secretion of soluble and vesicle-associated viral proteins that can skew these measurements. With recent technological advances in flow cytometry, it is now possible to analyze viruses down to 90nm in diameter with an approach called flow virometry. The technique has the added benefit of being able to discriminate viruses from extracellular vesicles and free viral proteins in order to confidently provide an intact viral particle count. Here we used flow virometry to provide new insights into the basic characteristics of Moloney MLV.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691183>White Matter Abnormalities Linked to Interferon, Stress Response, and Energy Metabolism Gene Expression Changes in Older HIV-Positive Patients on Antiretroviral Therapy.</a></h2><p>Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) remains a significant cause of morbidity in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals despite highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). White matter abnormalities have emerged as a key component of age-related neurodegeneration, and accumulating evidence suggests they play a role in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. Viral persistence in the brain induces chronic  associated with lymphocytic infiltration, microglial proliferation, myelin loss, and cerebrovascular lesions. In this study, gene expression profiling was performed on frontal white matter from 34 older HIV+ individuals on HAART (18 with NCI) and 24 HIV-negative controls. We used the NanoString nCounter platform to evaluate 933 probes targeting , interferon and stress responses, energy metabolism, and central nervous system-related genes. Viral loads were measured using single-copy assays. Compared to HIV- controls, HIV+ individuals exhibited increased expression of genes related to interferon, MHC-1, and stress responses, myeloid cells, and T cells and decreased expression of genes associated with oligodendrocytes and energy metabolism in white matter. These findings correlated with increased white matter  and myelin pallor, suggesting interferon (IRFs, IFITM1, ISG15, MX1, OAS3) and stress response (ATF4, XBP1, CHOP, CASP1, WARS) gene expression changes are associated with decreased energy metabolism (SREBF1, SREBF2, PARK2, TXNIP) and oligodendrocyte myelin production (MAG, MOG), leading to white matter dysfunction. Machine learning identified a 15-gene signature predictive of HIV status that was validated in an independent cohort. No specific gene expression patterns were associated with NCI. These findings suggest therapies that decrease chronic  while protecting mitochondrial function may help to preserve white matter integrity in older HIV+ individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696377>Protective Effect of RIVA Against Sunitinib-Induced Cardiotoxicity by Inhibiting Oxidative Stress-Mediated : Probable Role of TGF-β and Smad Signaling.</a></h2><p>Sunitinib (SUN) is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved in 2006 as a first-line treatment for metastatic renal cell cancer. However, weak selectivity to kinase receptors and cardiotoxicity have limited the use of sunitinib. Rivaroxaban (RIVA) is a Factor Xa inhibitor with cardioprotective action.
