The bioactive compounds from these millets were purified by supercritical fluid extraction and their structure was elucidated using spectroscopic methods. Extracted bioactive components from these millets were similar in chemical structure to the phenolic aldehyde-Vanillin [4-Hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde]. Cell proliferative effect was assessed by MTT assay using HT-29 cell line. Compound 1 significantly inhibited the proliferation of HT-29 cells when treated with concentrations of 250 µg/ml and 1,000 µg/ml for 48 h, while compound  moderately inhibited the proliferation of the HT-29 cell line at the same concentration and time period. Cytotoxic activity of extracted compounds by the release of lactate dehydrogenase confirms that these compounds were not toxic to the cells at 250 µg/ml of compounds 1 and . In addition, flow cytometry results show a significant cell arrest in the G0/G1 phase and increase in the apoptotic cells in sub G0 phase, in a dose-dependent manner when compared with the control. The conclusion of this study suggests that the anticancer property of these millets is mediated through the presence of vanillin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592205>Dietary intake of probiotic kimchi ameliorated IL-6-driven  cachexia.</a></h1><p> cachexia is a syndrome accompanying weight loss, skeletal muscle atrophy, and loss of adipose tissue in patients with advanced . Since interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one of core mediators causing  cachexia and kimchi can modulate IL-6 response, we hypothesized dietary intake of kimchi can ameliorate  cachexia. In this study, we studied preemptive administration of kimchi can ameliorate mouse  carcinoma cells  (C26) adenocarcinoma-induced  cachexia and explored anti-cachexic mechanisms of kimchi focused on the changes of muscle atrophy, cachexic inflammation, and catabolic catastrophe. As results, dietary intake of kimchi significantly attenuated the development of  cachexia, presented with lesser weight loss, higher muscle preservation as well as higher survival from  cachexia in mice. Starting from significant inhibition of IL-6 and its signaling, kimchi afforded significant inhibition of muscle specific ubiquitin-proteasome system including inhibition of atrogin-1 and muscle ring finger protein-1 (MuRF-1) with other muscle related genes including mitofusin- (Mfn-) and PGC-1α. Significant inhibition of lipolysis gene such as adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive ligase (HSL) accompanied with significant induction of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol response element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) was achieved with kimchi. As gene regulation, IL-6 and their receptor as well as Janus kinase  (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were significantly attenuated with kimchi. In conclusion, dietary intake of  preventive kimchi can be an anticipating option to ameliorate  cachexia via suppressive action of IL-6 accompanied with decreased muscle atrophy and lipolysis.Copyright © 2019 JCBNCopyright © 2019 JCBN.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567930>Definitive Chemoradiation for Rectal : Is There a Role for Dose Escalation? A National  Database Study.</a></h1><p>Surgery remains the standard of care in rectal . Select patients will not undergo surgery for reasons such as medical inoperability or a watch-and-wait approach and instead are managed with definitive chemoradiation.We used the National  Database to identify overall survival and predictors thereof in the nonoperative management of patients with rectal .This was a retrospective review.This study used deidentified data from the National  Database.We queried the national  database from 2004 to 2014 for stage 1 to 3 rectal adenocarcinoma treated with only chemotherapy and radiation to definitive doses. Dose escalated therapy was defined as >54 Gy.Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify sociodemographic, treatment, and tumor characteristics predictive of dose escalation and overall survival. Propensity-adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios for survival were used to account for indication bias.Among the 6311 patients eligible for the study, 11% were treated with doses >54 Gy. Earlier stage and increased age/comorbidity patients were more likely to receive dose escalation, and patients with more recent treatment and treatment at an academic facility were less likely. The median follow-up time was 31 months (range, -154 mo). Three- and 5-year overall survival rates for all patients were 60% and 46%. Patients treated with dose escalation had a median survival of 33 months compared with 56 months for those treated with ≤54 Gy (p < 0.0001).The main limitation is the inherent selection bias present in National  Database studies. Important treatment details and outcomes as they relate to a definitive chemoradiation approach in rectal  are lacking. Salvage therapy was also not recorded, which in this population could be surgery.In this analysis, dose escalation in the nonoperative management of rectal  was associated with a lower overall survival compared with more conventional doses. Careful patient selection and enrollment on appropriate clinical trials may be warranted in the nonoperative setting. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B15. LA QUIMIORRADIACIÓN DEFINITIVA PARA EL CÁNCER RECTAL: ¿HAY LUGAR PARA EL AUMENTO DE LA DOSIS? UN ESTUDIO DE BASE DE DATOS NACIONAL DEL CÁNCER:: La cirugía sigue siendo el estándar en el tratamiento del cáncer rectal. Algunos pacientes no son quirúrgicos por razones como, no ser operables o con el enfoque de ver y esperar, y en su lugar son tratados con la quimiorradiación definitiva.Utilizamos la base de datos nacional del cáncer para identificar la supervivencia general y los factores predictivos de la misma, en el tratamiento no quirúrgico de pacientes con cáncer rectal.Esta fue una revisión retrospectiva.Utilizamos los datos identificados en la base de datos nacional del cáncer.Se consultó la base de datos nacional del cáncer del 2004-2014, para adenocarcinoma rectal en estadio 1-3, tratada únicamente con quimioterapia y radiación hasta la dosis definitiva. La terapia de aumento de la dosis se definió como >54 Gy.Se realizaron análisis univariables y multivariables para identificar características sociodemográficas, de tratamiento y predictivas del aumento de la dosis y supervivencia en general. Los índices de riesgo proporcionales de Cox ajustados a la propensión para la supervivencia, se utilizaron para tener en cuenta el sesgo de indicación.Entre los 6311 pacientes elegibles para el estudio, el 11% fue tratado con dosis >54 Gy. Los pacientes en estadios tempranos y con mayor edad/comorbilidad, tenían más probabilidades de recibir aumento de la dosis, y menos propensos los pacientes con tratamientos recientes y de centros académicos. El tiempo medio de seguimiento fue de 31 meses (-154 meses). Las tasas de supervivencia global de tres y cinco años para todos los pacientes, fueron respectivamente del 60% y 46%. Los pacientes tratados con aumento de la dosis, tuvieron una supervivencia media de 33 meses, en comparación con los 56 meses para los pacientes tratados con ≤54 Gy (p < 0,0001).La principal limitación es el inherente sesgo en la selección, presente en los estudios de la base de datos nacional del cáncer. Faltan los detalles importantes del tratamiento y los resultados en relación con el enfoque definitivo de quimiorradiación en cáncer rectal. Tampoco se registró la terapia de rescate, que en esta población podría ser la cirugía.En este análisis, el aumento de la dosis en el manejo no quirúrgico del cáncer rectal, se asoció con una menor supervivencia global, en comparación con la dosis más convencional. La cuidadosa selección del paciente y la inscripción en los apropiados ensayos clínicos, pueden estar justificados en el entorno no quirúrgico.

Although anti- drug oxaliplatin (Oxa) effectively inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, the growing resistance and side-effects make it urgent to improve the therapeutic strategy of Oxa. Although Oxa induces the autophagy process, the role of PFKFB3 in this process remains unknown. In addition, whether PFKFB3 affects the cytotoxicity of Oxa has not been investigated. Here, we show that Oxa-inhibited cell proliferation and migration concomitant with the induction of apoptosis and autophagy in SW480 cells. Both inhibition of autophagy by small molecule inhibitors and siRNA modification decreased the cell viability loss and apoptosis induced by Oxa. Utilizing quantitative PCR and immunoblotting, we observed that Oxa increased PFKFB3 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, suppression of PFKFB3 attenuated both the basal and Oxa-induced autophagy, by monitoring the autophagic flux and phosphorylated-Ulk1, which play essential roles in autophagy initiation. Moreover, PFKFB3 inhibition further inhibited the cell proliferation/migration, and cell viability decreased by Oxa. Collectively, the presented data demonstrated that PFKFB3 inhibition attenuated Oxa-induced autophagy and enhanced its cytotoxicity in colorectal  cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626095>Increased expression of long non-coding RNA CCAT2 predicts poorer prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Long non-coding RNA -associated transcript  (CCAT2) is a 1752-bp lncRNA transcribed from m8q24 genomic region. A lot of investigations have confirmed the involvement of CCAT2 in the tumorigenesis of many  types. Previous studies found that over-expression of CCAT2 significantly promoted cell migration and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis of HCC cells. In the present investigation, the clinical value and prognostic significance of CCAT2 were investigated.The 122 pairs of HCC tissues and adjacent normal liver tissues were acquired between September 2013 and February 2018. The expression levels of CCAT2 in HCC tissues and their corresponding adjacent normal liver tissues were examined by RT-qPCR analysis. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed using the log-rank test. Independent prognostic indicators were determined in the multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazard model.CCAT2 expression levels were significantly increased in HCC tissues compared to that in their normal counterparts (P < .001). CCAT2 expression was significantly correlated with vascular invasion (P = .001), histopathologic grading (P = .001), distant metastasis (P = .002) and TNM stage (P = .018). A Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that the overall survival rate of HCC patients in high CCAT2 expression group markedly decreased as compared with that of low CCAT2 expression group (P = .016). In addition, COX multivariate analysis showed that high expression of CCAT2 was an independent risk factor for predicting shorter overall survival time in HCC (HR = .126, 95%CI:1.273-8.775, P = .021).Taken together, this research revealed that lncRNA CCAT2 may serve as a potential biomarker for predicting overall survival time in HCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637417>Transanal ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis has comparable long-term functional outcomes to transabdominal approach: a multicentre comparative study.</a></h1><p>The transanal approach to ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (Ta-IPAA) provides better access to the lower pelvis with lower short-term morbidity in ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of this study was to assess the long-term functional outcomes after Ta-IPAA versus transabdominal IPAA (Abd-IPAA) in UC.A multicentre cohort analysis was done between March 2002 and September 2017. Patient characteristics, surgical details and postoperative outcomes were compared. CGQL (Cleveland global quality of life) score at 12 months with a functioning pouch was considered the primary endpoint.A total of 374 patients (100 Ta-IPAA vs 274 Abd-IPAA) were included. Ta-IPAA demonstrated a comparable overall quality of life (CGQL score) to Abd-IPAA (0.75 ± 0.11 vs 0.71 ± 0.14; respectively, p=0.1). Quality of life (7.71 ± 1.17 vs 7.30 ± 1.46; p=0.04) and energy level items (7.16 ± 1.52 vs 6.66 ± 1.68; p=0.03) were significantly better after Ta-IPAA, while the quality of health item was comparable (7.68 ± 1.26 vs 7.64 ± 1.44; p=0.96). Analysis excluding anastomotic leaks did not change the overall CGQL scores. Stool frequencies (>10/ 24 hrs:22% vs 21%; p=1.0) and the rate of single episode of major incontinence during the 12-month period (27% vs 26%; p=0.89) were similar. The differences in thirty-day morbidity rates (33% vs 41%; p=0.) and the anastomotic leak rates were not significant (6% vs 13%; p=0.09).This study provides evidence of comparable long-term functional outcome and quality of life after Ta-IPAA and Abd-IPAA for UC.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

The assessment of the therapeutic response is important to change protocol strategy. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography PET/CT, a valuable tool gives both metabolic and anatomic information for whole-body regions. Obesity is an important risk factor for colorectal .To evaluate post-surgical and therapeutic colorectal  by PET/CT and study obesity association to its prognosis.This was a prospective study involved 93 patients with, post-surgical colorectal  examined by PET/CT, then follow up after 4-6 months.There was a statistically significant difference between PET/CT and contrast CT. The sensitivity& the specificity were (96.4%-100% & 92.3%-98.%) for PET/CT and (84.%-90.% & 76.5%-85.4%) for contrast CT respectively. Post-therapeutic follow up showed; progressive course (24.5%), stationary course (26.4%), partial regression (28.3%) and complete regression course (20.8%). Obesity is a risk factor for progression with highly statistically significant to treatment response. Obese patients had a progressive or stationary course of the disease. Also, there was a highly statistically significant association between total abdominal fat & visceral abdominal fat areas with good response of treatment.PET/CT is the most appropriate imaging technique to detect any recurrence or metastases in post-surgical colorectal  with high sensitivity and specificity comparing to CT. Obesity is a predictor risk factor for prognosis of the disease, as generally and abdominally (total & visceral fat) had an association with therapeutic response.Copyright: © 2019 Safenaz Y.

We sought to determine if completeness of preoperative care was associated with pathologic specimen quality and postoperative morbidity.Clinical stage I-III rectal adenocarcinoma patients who underwent elective low anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection were identified from the 2016-2017 American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) database. The 3 preoperative NSQIP variables (colonoscopy, stoma marking, and neoadjuvant chemoradiation) were used to divide patients into  cohorts: complete vs incomplete preoperative care. The primary outcome was a composite higher pathologic specimen quality score (>12 lymph nodes, negative circumferential, and negative distal margins). The secondary outcome was 30-day morbidity. Preoperative characteristics were compared with ANOVAs and chi-square tests. Outcomes measures were evaluated with logistic regression.We identified 1,125 patients: 591 (52.5%) complete and 534 (47.5%) incomplete. The complete group was younger, had more women, lower-third rectal tumors, clinical stage III disease, and neoadjuvant treatment. The complete group had higher odds of better pathologic specimen quality after adjusting for age, sex, tumor location, stage, and neoadjuvant therapy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.75, p = 0.001). The complete group had decreased rates of transfusions (odds ratio [OR] 0.47, p < 0.001), postoperative ileus (OR 0.67, p = 0.01), sepsis (OR 0.32, p = 0.01), and readmissions (OR 0.60, p = 0.003). Other complications did not statistically differ between groups.Complete preoperative care in rectal adenocarcinoma is associated with higher pathologic specimen quality and reduced postoperative morbidity.

Mice bearing subcutaneous CT26  tumors were injected i.v. with 1 g/kg (535 mg iodine/kg) IX-lipo, and  CT and CEST MR images were acquired on day 3. CT and CEST MR images were also acquired for tumor-bearing mice co-injected with IX-lipo and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α).In addition to CT contrast, IX-lipo exhibited a strong CEST contrast similar to its non-liposomal form, with a detectability of ~ nM per liposome. Both CT imaging and CEST MRI showed that i.v. injection of IX-lipo resulted in a rim enhancement of CT26 tumors with a heterogeneous central distribution. In contrast, co-injection of TNF-α caused a significantly augmented CT/MRI contrast in the tumor center. The intratumoral biodistribution of IX-lipo correlated well to the rhodamine patterns observed with fluorescence microscopy.We have developed a CT/MRI bimodal imaging approach for monitoring the delivery and biodistribution of liposomes by loading them with the clinically approved X-ray/CT contrast agent iodixanol. Our approach may be easily adapted for other-FDA approved iodinated agents and thus has great translational potential.2019 Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been identified which are associated with CRP levels, and Mendelian randomization studies have shown a positive association between SNPs increasing CRP expression and risk of  (but thus far not CVD). The effects of individual genetic variants often interact with the genetic background of a population and hence we sought to resolve the genetic determinants of serum CRP in a number of American Indian populations.The Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS) has serum CRP measurements from 2428 tribal members, recruited as large families from three regions of the United States. Microsatellite markers and MetaboChip defined SNP genotypes were incorporated into variance components, decomposition-based linkage and association analyses.CRP levels exhibited significant heritability (h2 = 0.33 ± 0.05, p<1.3 X 10-20). A locus on chromosome (chr) 6, near marker D6S281 (approximately at 169.6 Mb, GRCh38/hg38) showed suggestive linkage (LOD = 1.9) to CRP levels. No individual SNPs were found associated with CRP levels after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing (threshold <7.77 x 10-7), however, we found nominal associations, many of which replicate previous findings at the CRP, HNF1A and 7 other loci. In addition, we report association of 46 SNPs located at 7 novel loci on chromosomes , 5, 6( loci), 9, 10 and 17, with an average of 15.3 Kb between SNPs and all with p-values less than 7. X 10-4.In agreement with evidence from other populations, these data show CRP serum levels are under considerable genetic influence; and include loci, such as near CRP and other genes, that replicate results from other ethnic groups. These findings also suggest possible novel loci on chr 6 and other chromosomes that warrant further investigation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601952>SPIONs/3D SiSBA-16 based Multifunctional Nanoformulation for target specific cisplatin release in  and cervical  cell lines.</a></h1><p>Multifunctional nanomaterials can be used for dual applications: drug delivery as well as in bioimaging.

Study-specific estimates of the relative risk (RR) were combined using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 statistic. Data were analyzed from April 9, 2018, through February 22, 2019.Pooled RR estimates for  incidence and  mortality for psoriasis cohorts compared with people without psoriasis.A total of 58 unique studies were included, with quality varying for the incidence and the mortality studies. Severe psoriasis (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.08-1.39 [9 studies]) and all severities of psoriasis (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.06-1.31 [7 studies]) were associated with an increased risk of  (overall), and associations were found for a range of site-specific cancers, including  (RR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.03-1.35]), colorectal (RR, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.06-1.70]), kidney (RR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.11-.24]), laryngeal (RR, 1.79 [95% CI, 1.06-3.01]), liver (RR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.28-.61]), lymphoma (RR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.24-1.57]), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (RR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.15-1.43]), keratinocyte cancers (RR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.08-.71]), esophageal (RR, .05 [95% CI, 1.04-4.07]), oral cavity (RR, .80 [95% CI, 1.99-3.93]), and pancreatic (RR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.16-1.73]). Overall  mortality risk was higher in patients with severe psoriasis (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.08-1.38 [4 studies]). Specifically, liver (RR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.09-1.88]), esophageal (RR, .53 [95% CI, 1.87-3.41]), and pancreatic (RR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.02-1.69])  mortality were found to be elevated in those with severe psoriasis. The heterogeneity of estimates was often very high despite stratification. Marked attenuation of risk was found in those studies that adjusted estimates for smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity.In this study, people with psoriasis appeared to have an increased risk of  incidence and -related mortality involving a range of site-specific cancers. Future research examining specific lifestyle factors, treatments, and the inflammatory processes that contribute to psoriasis may help provide additional information on the underlying mechanisms for the apparent increased  risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582388>Diagnostic Accuracy and Scope of Intraoperative Transoral Ultrasound and Transoral Ultrasound-Guided Fine-Needle Aspiration of Retropharyngeal Masses.</a></h1><p>The use of transoral sonography-guided fine-needle aspiration for intraoperative localization of retropharyngeal masses has been described by Fornage et al. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of this technique. We reviewed the images and medical records of 26 patients with a retropharyngeal lesion suspicious for a metastatic lymph node of Rouviere identified on CT and/or PET/CT. There were 14 patients with a history of thyroid , 7 with mucosal squamous cell carcinoma, 1 with renal cell carcinoma, 1 with parotid acinic cell , 1 with metastatic  adenocarcinoma, and  with no history of . Intraoperative transoral sonography was performed using a commercially available endovaginal transducer. A transoral sonography-guided fine-needle aspiration was performed with a 25-cm-long 20-ga Chiba needle through a needle guide attached to the transducer shaft. Cytopathologic results were categorized as malignant, benign, or nondiagnostic. Transoral sonography and transoral sonography-guided fine-needle aspiration were performed in all patients. A diagnostic specimen was obtained in 25 of 26 (96%) patients with a 100% overall accuracy. Twelve patients underwent subsequent transoral resection of the retropharyngeal mass. In each patient, surgical pathology confirmed the fine-needle aspiration biopsy result. In 4 patients, transoral sonography-guided injection of methylene blue was used to facilitate intraoperative localization of the metastatic retropharyngeal mass. Transoral sonography and transoral sonography-guided fine-needle aspiration of suspicious masses in the retropharyngeal space are highly accurate procedures for identification and cytologic evaluation of benign and metastatic lymph nodes of Rouviere and for presurgical localization.© 2019 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581454>Protein Expression Profiling Identifies Key Proteins and Pathways Involved in Growth Inhibitory Effects Exerted by Guggulsterone in Human Colorectal  Cells.</a></h1><p>Colorectal  (CRC) is a leading killer  worldwide and one of the most common malignancies with increasing incidences of mortality. Guggulsterone (GS) is a plant sterol used for treatment of various ailments such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and arthritis. In the current study, anti- effects of GS in human colorectal  cell line HCT 116 was tested, potential targets identified using mass spectrometry-based label-free shotgun proteomics approach and key pathways validated by proteome profiler antibody arrays. Comprehensive proteomic profiling identified 14 proteins as significantly dysregulated. Proteins involved in cell proliferation/migration, tumorigenesis, cell growth, metabolism, and DNA replication were downregulated while the protein with functional role in exocytosis/tumor suppression was found to be upregulated. Our study evidenced that GS treatment altered expression of Bcl- mediated the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c which triggered the formation of apoptosome as well as activation of caspase-3/7 leading to death of HCT 116 cells via intrinsic apoptosis pathway. GS treatment also induced expression of p53 protein while p21 expression was unaltered with no cell cycle arrest. In addition, GS was found to inhibit NF-kB signaling in  cells by quelling the expression of its regulated gene products Bcl-, cIAP-1, and survivin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612509>Risk factors for survival following recurrence after first liver resection for colorectal  liver metastases.</a></h1><p>Management of recurrence following liver resection for colorectal  metastases is a topic of debate. We determined risk factors for survival following recurrence after liver resection.Long-term follow-up of patients in the PETCAM trial who had recurrence following liver resection. Risk groups were created according to their survival risk. Differences in overall survival (OS) between groups were estimated. Disease-free survival (DFS), patterns of disease recurrence and management were determined. Cox proportional hazard models, Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test were used.Among 368 patients who underwent liver resection, 264 (72%) experienced disease recurrence (51% lung and 41% liver). Following liver resection, DFS: 17 months (95% CI, 14-19); OS: 57 months (95% CI, 46-70). In those who recurred, 120 (45%) received chemotherapy only, and 112 (42%) underwent second surgical resection. Among patients who experienced recurrence (n = 264), the high-risk group (more than one site of recurrence or disease-free duration < 5 months and node-positive disease) had median OS: 19 months (95% CI, 15-23) vs 36 months (95% CI, 30-48) for patients in the low-risk group (HR = .9, 95% CI, .-3.9).Recurrence following liver resection is common. Following recurrence after liver resection, patients should be carefully selected for surgical re-resection based on risk factors.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610336>Epstein-Barr Virus-Positive Mucocutaneous Ulcers Complicate Colitis Caused by Immune Checkpoint Regulator Therapy and Associate With  Perforation.</a></h1><p> therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause colitis and  perforation. We investigated whether infection with Epstein Barr virus (EBV) associates with development and severity of colitis in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.We performed a retrospective analysis of fixed  tissues from 16 patients (12 men, 4 women, median age, 69.5 y) with colitis after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (9 patients treated with anti-CTLA4, 3 patients treated with anti-PD1, and 4 patients received a combination). Ten tissue samples were biopsies and 6 were collected during resection (4 surgeries for  perforation). Patients were treated between 2010 and 2018 in the United Kingdom. The tissues were analyzed by pathology, in situ hybridization (to detect EBV-encoded small RNAs [EBERs]), and immunohistochemistry. Clinical data were also collected. tissues from 4 of the 13 patients who received anti-CTLA4 (alone or in combination, 4 with  perforation) had EBV-positive lymphoproliferations that manifested as florid ulcers associated with polymorphous infiltrates containing EBV-positive blasts (CD30+ or CD30-negative, CD20+, CD3-negative, and EBER+), plasma cells (CD138+, CD20-negative, and EBER+ or EBER-negative), and small B cells (CD20+, CD3-negative, and EBER+ or EBER-negative), consistent with EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers (EBVMCUs). In analyses of biopsies collected from  patients with EBVMCUs over multiple time points, we found that earlier biopsies had no or only a few EBV-positive cells, whereas 1 later biopsy had EBVMCU and co-infection with cytomegalovirus. EBVMCUs were associated with steroid-refractory colitis (100% of EBV-positive patients vs 12.5% of EBV-negative patients; P=.008) and  perforation (100% of EBV-positive patients vs no EBV-negative patients; P=.001).We found that  tissues from 4/13 patients with colitis after anti-CTLA4 therapy (4/6 patients who underwent resection and 4/4 patients with  perforation) contained EBVMCUs. EBVMCUs seem to arise secondarily in areas of inflamed  due to immunosuppressive treatment for colitis.

The aim of this study is to evaluate demographic and tumor characteristics of young patients and analyze the short-term surgical outcomes of patients undergoing surgery.We performed a -year review (2015-2016) of the ACS-NSQIP and included all patients with CC who underwent surgical management. Patients were stratified into two groups: early-onset CC (< 50 years old) and late-onset CC (≥ 50 years old). Outcome measures were hospital length of stay, 30-day complications, mortality, and readmission.We included a total of 15,957 patients in the analysis. Mean age was 65 ± 13 years, and 52% were male. Overall 10% of the patients had early-onset CC. Patients with early-onset CC were more likely to be black (11% vs 7%, p = 0.04) and Hispanic (8% vs 4%, p = 0.02). Additionally, they presented with a more aggressive tumor and higher TNM staging. Patients with early onset CC had lower 30-day complications (18% vs 22%, p = 0.02), shorter hospital length of stay (6[3-8] vs 8[5-11], p = 0.03) and lower 30-day mortality (0.4% vs 1.8%, p = 0.04) compared to their counterparts. However, there was no difference between the two groups regarding 30-day readmission. On regression analysis, there was no difference between the two groups regarding study outcomes.Racial disparity does exist in the incidence of  in the young with higher incidence in blacks. Younger patients with CC tend to have better surgical outcomes on univariate analysis. On regression analysis, the surgical outcomes between the two groups are comparable.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31568802>Doxorubicin conjugated AuNP/biopolymer composites facilitate cell cycle regulation and exhibit superior tumor suppression potential in KRAS mutant colorectal .</a></h1><p>Colorectal  is a leading cause of death in the world. Despite the progress in therapeutic development, there are still challenges in clinical practice. Nanomedicine has emerged as a solution to enhance traditional therapy. Gold nanoparticles (AuNP) have been demonstrated as potential appliance in treating cancers, yet few studies investigated the capacity of biopolymer-conjugated AuNP in  as well as examined the system in both  cell line and animal models. In this study, we designed the AuNP/biopolymer composite therapeutic system with a chemotherapy agent, doxorubicin (DOX). Two composites with different drug load were applied (referred to as AuPPPyA and AuPPPyB). The composites were characterized by UV spectrum, transmission electron microscope (TEM), zeta potential measurement, and cell cycle analysis. Both therapeutic systems exhibited superior cytotoxic effects compared to DOX alone group. Compatible results were also demonstrated in vivo, as tumor inhibition rate were 46.% in AuPPPyA and 66.4% in AuPPPyB, which were both higher than that of DOX alone (30%). Cell cycle regulation mediated by our composites was also examined in our study. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that AuNP/biopolymer composites are powerful in treating KRAS gene mutated colorectal , and the system could potentially contribute to other clinical refractory diseases in the future.Copyright © 2019.

NAD-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) catalyzes the oxidation of the 15(S)-hydroxyl group of PGE to generate 15-keto PGE. 15-PGDH has been known as a tumor suppressor in various malignancies including . However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumor-suppressive function of 15-PGDH remain largely unresolved. In this study, we found that 15-keto PGE upregulated the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a representative antioxidative and anti-inflammatory enzyme, at both transcriptional and translational levels in human  epithelial CCD 841 CoN cells. A redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) plays a critical role in the regulation of HO-1 and other cytoprotective proteins. 15-Keto PGE induced translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus and antioxidant response element-driven luciferase activity. Furthermore, the silencing of the Nrf2 gene abolished 15-keto PGE-induced HO-1 expression in CCD 841 CoN cells. 15-Keto PGE activated AKT signaling, and the pharmacological AKT inhibitor, LY294002 suppressed the 15-keto PGE-induced HO-1 expression. 15-Keto PGE generates the reactive oxygen species which is suppressed by the general antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine. N-acetyl-l-cysteine treatment attenuated the 15-keto PGE-induced phosphorylation of GSK3β, transcriptional activity of Nrf2, and subsequently HO-1 expression. However, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE lacking the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety failed to induce reactive oxygen species, HO-1 expression and nuclear translocation of Nrf2. In conclusion, 15-keto PGE induces HO-1 expression through Nrf2 activation in human  epithelial cells.Copyright © 2019.

The Low Rectal  Development Program international taTME registry recently reported a 0.8% incidence, but actual incidence and mechanisms of injury remain largely unknown.A retrospective analysis of taTME cases complicated by urologic injury was conducted. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, intraoperative details, and outcomes were analyzed, along with surgeons' experience and training in taTME. Surgeons' opinion of contributing factors and best approaches to avoid injuries were evaluated.Thirty-four urethral,  ureteral, and 3 bladder injuries were reported during taTME operations performed over 7 years by 32 surgical teams. Twenty injuries occurred during the teams' first 8 taTME cases ("early experience"), whereas the remainder occurred between the 12th to 101st case. Injuries resulted in a 22% conversion rate and 8% rate of unplanned APR or Hartmann procedure. At median follow-up of 27.6 months (range, 3-85), the urethral repair complication rate was 26% with a 9% rate of failed urethral repair requiring permanent urinary diversion. In patients with successful repair, 18% reported persistent urinary dysfunction.Urologic injuries result in substantial morbidity. Our survey indicated that those occurring in surgeons' early experience might best be reduced by implementation of structured taTME training and proctoring, whereas those occurring later relate to case complexity and may be avoided by more stringent case selection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602323>Loss of ferrochelatase is protective against  cells: ferrochelatase a possible regulator of the long noncoding RNA H19.</a></h1><p>Ferrochelatase (FECH) is the last enzyme of the heme biosynthesis pathway. Deficiency in FECH was associated with many diseases, including protoporphyria. Correlation studies showed that variations of FECH expression was detected in human carcinomas and more specifically in . Nevertheless, the potential role of FECH in  carcinogenesis  was not depicted yet.A small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to knockdown FECH in human Caco-  cells. The effect of FECH down-regulation on the cellular proliferation, the migration and the expression of target genes was assessed in  cells and compared to human normal fibroblasts.Following FECH down-regulation, our results demonstrated that the proliferation of Caco- cells was not affected. Furthermore, the migration of  and normal cells was affected, only when an additional stress factor (HO) was applied to the medium. The expression of twist, snail, hypoxia induced factor (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was reduced in Caco- cells. Conversely, VEGF and HIF-1α expression were upregulated by up to  folds in control fibroblasts. Interestingly, the pro-carcinogenic long noncoding RNA (LncRNA) H19 was 70% down-regulated in Caco- cells upon FECH down regulation whereas no effect was observed in normal fibroblasts.In conclusion, we showed that loss of FECH is protective against  tumorigenesis  and this effect could possibly be mediated through inhibition of H19.2019 Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.

The level of expression was increased with increasing tumor grade (GI-III) and size (T1-4) of IDC specimens.More induction of Nectin-4 was noted in relapsed samples from a variety of tumors (, tongue, liver, kidney, ovary, buccal mucosa) in comparison to primary tumors, while paired adjacent normal tissues do not express any Nectin-4. A high expression of Nectin-4 along with other representative markers in CTCs and lymph node metastasis was also observed in  specimens. An increased level of Nectin-4 along with representative metastatic (CD-44, Sca1, ALDH1, Nanog) and angiogenic (Ang-I, Ang-II, VEGF) markers were noted in metastatic tumors (local and distant) in comparison to primary tumors that were correlated with different grades of tumor progression. In addition, greater expression of Nectin-4 was observed in secondary tumors (distant metastasis, e.g., breast to liver or stomach to gall bladder) in comparison to primary tumors.Our study demonstrated a significant correlation between Nectin-4 expression and tumor grade as well as stages (p < 0.001), suggesting its association with tumor progression.

Here, we mimicked an inflammatory microenvironment both in vitro and in vivo and investigated its effects on the invasion and metastasis of . Moreover,  patient samples were also analyzed statistically. Conditioned medium from the differentiated macrophages induced invasion and migration of  cells in vitro, which could be reversed by the treatment of a neutralizing anti-growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) antibody, indicating GDF15 involvement in inflammation-induced invasiveness. Also, we observed similar effects of human recombinant GDF15 on  cells. Mechanistically, GDF15 activated c-Fos by separating it from Lamin A/C, increasing transcriptional activity of c-Fos and regulating EMT gene expressions. However, c-Fos knockdown using lentivirus shRNA plasmid inhibited GDF15-triggered invasion and migration in vitro. In vivo, inflammation caused by lipopolysaccharides obviously increased GDF15 secretion, and c-Fos knockdown reduced the lung metastasis of  cells in mice model. In addition, c-Fos expressions in patient samples were found to be associated with  metastasis and TNM stages.

These cells have a high rate of glutaminolysis and release ammonia (NH) as a byproduct, which may function as a diffusible signal among  cells and can reveal cellular heterogeneity. E7, a nematic liquid crystal (LC), is doped with 4-pentyl-4'-biphenyl carboxylic acid (PBA) and encapsulated in polymeric microcapsules (P-E7), which are then immobilized on cells in a microfluidic channel. Normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and myeloma, human primary glioblastoma (U87), human  carcinoma (Caco-), and human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells are investigated for the release of NH. The P-E7 is able to visualize NH release from the cell via a radial-to-bipolar (R-B) orientation change, observed through a polarized optical microscope. The various cell lines significantly differ in their response time required for an R-B change. The mean response times for Caco-, U87, and MCF-7 cells are 277, 155, and 121 s, respectively.

Preoperative radiotherapy was administered to 89 patients (51.1%) in the biological mesh group and 20 patients (37.0%) in the primary closure group. The biological mesh group had significantly lower rates of perineal wound infection (11.5% vs 22.%; p = 0.047), perineal hernia (3.4% vs 13.0%; p = 0.022), wound dehiscence (0.6% vs 5.6%; p = 0.042), and total perineal wound complications (14.9% vs 35.%; p = 0.001) compared with the primary closure group. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed preoperative radiotherapy (p < 0.001), conventional primary closure (p < 0.001), and intraoperative bowel perforation (p = 0.001) to be significantly associated with perineal procedure-related complications.This was a single-center retrospective study.Although perineal wound repair with biological mesh prolongs the operative time of perineal portion, the perineal drainage retention time, and the length of hospital stay, it may reduce perineal procedure-related complications and improve wound healing. Preoperative radiotherapy and intraoperative bowel perforation appear to be independent predictors of perineal complications.

Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is a NET with poorly differentiated histological features, high proliferative properties and associated poor prognoses. Since these carcinomas are so rare, and thus, affect only a small number of patients allowing for few cell lines to be derived from patient biopsies, the histological, immunohistochemical, and clinical characteristics associated with colorectal NEC and NECs in other organs, have yet to be clearly defined. Herein, we describe the establishment of a novel NEC cell line (SS-) derived from a tumor resection of the ascending  from a 59-year-old Japanese woman. The histological, electron microscopic and immunohistochemical features of chromogranin A (CgA) as well as the confirmation of synaptophysin positivity in this tumor were typical of those commonly observed in surgically resected colorectal NECs. Further, the Ki-67 labeling index of the resected tumor was > 20 %, and thus, the tumor was diagnosed as an NEC of the ascending . The SS- cell line maintained characteristic features to those of the resected tumor, which were further retained following implantation into the subcutaneous tissues of nude mice. Additionally, when SS- cells were seeded into ultra-low attachment plates they formed spheres that expressed higher levels of the  stem cell (CSC) marker CD133 compared to SS- cells cultured under adherent conditions. SS- cells may, therefore, contribute to the current knowledge on midgut NEC biological behaviors, while providing a novel platform for examining the effects of colorectal NEC drugs, including CSC.© 2019 The Authors.

We reported trends in  incidence for twenty five years as well as the mortality to incidence ratio (MIR) as main quality indicator of the Mauritius National  Registry (MNCR).We calculated age standardised incidence rates (ASRs) of cancers by sex and by 5 year age group for five successive year periods from 1991 to 2015. The average annual percentage change (AAPC) were determined by sex and  sites. MIRs were compared for the period 2001-2004 and 2012-2015.In males, the most common  sites (in terms of ASRs per 100,000) were those of the -rectum (17.0), prostate (16.5), trachea-bronchus-lung (13.0), stomach (8.4) and lip-oral cavity-pharynx (7.7). The AAPC were +3.9%, +4.%, +0.5%, -0.1% and -1.3% respectively. In females, the most frequent sites were breast (53.7), -rectum (13.), cervix uteri (11.), corpus uteri (7.7) and ovary (5.7). The AAPC were +3.4%, +4.4%, -%, +5.% and -0.1% respectively. The most significant decrease in MIRs among males were liver (1.9 to 1.0), stomach (1.3 to 0.8) and lung (1.7 to 1.) cancers while among females, they were pancreas (3.4 to 1.3), liver (1.8 to 1.) and stomach (1.5 to 0.8) cancers.The most common cancers were those associated with 'westernisation' of lifestyle.

It is known that integrins play an important role in anoikis resistance, but detailed mechanisms are not well understood. Here we report that highly metastatic  cells showed a higher degree of anoikis resistance than the normal intestinal epithelial cells. These anoikis-resistant  cells express high-levels of integrin-α, β1, and activated EGFR in the anchorage-independent state than the anchorage-dependent state. In contrast, normal intestinal epithelial cells failed to elevate these proteins. Interestingly, a higher co-association of EGFR with integrin-αβ1/-α5β1 was observed on the surface of anoikis-resistant cells. Thus, in the absence of extra-cellular matrix, integrins in association with EGFR activates downstream effectors ERK and AKT and suppress Caspase-3 activation to induce anoikis resistance as was confirmed from the gene-ablation and pharmacological inhibitor studies. Interestingly, these anoikis-resistant  cells express high-level of  stem cell signatures (CD24, CD44, CD133, EpCAM) and pluripotent stem cell markers (OCT-4, SOX-, Nanog) as well as drug-resistant pumps (ABCG2, MDR1, MRP1). Altogether, our findings unravel the interplay between integrin-αβ1/-α5β1 and EGFR in anoikis resistance and suggest that the resistant cells are  initiating or  stem cells, which may serve as a promising target to combat metastasis of .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646798>Prognostic importance of tumor location and anti-EGFR therapy in patients with K-RAS wild type metastatic colorectal .</a></h1><p>To compare anti-EGFR and anti-VEGF agents in patients with K-RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal  (mCRC) with regards to tumor location.450 patients diagnosed with mCRC, who applied to our center were included in this retrospective study.

Different plant parts possess various phytochemicals, playing important roles in preventing and curing diseases. Scientists, through extensive experimental studies, are playing an important part in establishing the use of phytochemicals in medicine. However, there are still a large number of medicinal plants which need to be studied for their phytochemical profile. In this study, the objective was to isolate phytochemicals from bark of  L. and to study them for their antioxidant and cytotoxic activities. The bark was extracted with methanol, followed by column chromatography and thus isolating kaempferol, stigmasterol, protocatechuic acid-methyl ester (PCA-ME) and protocatechuic acid (PCA). ,-azinobis-3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) and , '-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) radical scavenging assays were utilized for assessment of antioxidant activity, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol--yl)-,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye reduction assay was used to determine cytotoxic activity against C-6 glioma rat brain, MCF-7 breast , and HCT-15  cell lines. The compounds were found to have significant antioxidant and cytotoxic activity.

However, completing the full-cycle of oxaliplatin is often associated with severe neurotoxicity. To spare patients from the toxic effects, without comprising the required efficacy, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of a modified XELOX (mXELOX) adjuvant chemotherapy regimen with 6 cycles of oxaliplatin and a full cycle of capecitabine.We retrospectively analyzed 330 eligible patients with stage III  who underwent curative tumor resection followed by mXELOX, standard XELOX or unfinished XELOX adjuvant chemotherapy between December 2007 and April 2015. Associated prognostic factors were investigated and their disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were also determined and compared among the different regimen groups.Compared with the standard XELOX group, the mXELOX group had lower total incidence rates of neurotoxicity (39.3% vs. 76.%, P < 0.001), leucopenia (53.6% vs. 69.8%, P = 0.017) and thrombocytopenia (38.1% vs. 56.3%, P = 0.011). The standard XELOX and mXELOX adjuvant chemotherapy regimens presented with comparable 3-year DFS rates (86.3% vs. 89.%; P = 0.838) and 3-year OS rates (92.7% vs. 97.6%; P = 0.227). Compared to unfinished XELOX chemotherapy, the oncologic benefits of the mXELOX regimen were greater for patients with T4 tumors (3-year DFS: Hazard ratio [HR], .184; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.051-4.540; P = 0.036; 3-year OS: HR, 4.529; 95% CI 1.245-16.479; P = 0.022) and for high-risk patients (3-year DFS: HR, 1.962; 95% CI 0.964-3.993; P = 0.044; 3-year OS: HR, 4.193; 95% CI 1.182-14.874; P = 0.026).The mXELOX adjuvant chemotherapy presented a comparable survival benefit and lower incidence of toxicity than standard XELOX chemotherapy.

The heterogeneity and genomic instability of  tumors make current treatments unsatisfactory. This study evaluated a novel nanoscale delivery platform comprising phosphonated calixarenes (P4C6) co-loaded with paclitaxel (PTX) and carboplatin (CPT). The nanoparticles showed average hydrodynamic sizes of 84 ± 8 nm for empty P4C6 nanoparticle and 119 ± 13 nm for PTX-CPT-P4C6. The corresponding zeta potentials were -40.8 ± 8.8 and -35.4 ± 4. mV. The optimal CPT:PTX ratio was 5.22:1, and PTX-CPT-P4C6 with this ratio was more cytotoxic against HT-29 cells than against Caco- cells (IC, 0.4 ± 0.02 vs. .1 ± 0.3 μM), and it induced higher apoptosis in HT-29 cells (56.6 ± 4.5 vs. 44.9 ± 3.44%). PTX-CPT-P4C6 inhibited the invasion and migration of HT-29 cells more strongly than the free drugs. It also inhibited the growth of HT-29 tumors in mice to the greatest extent of all formulations, with negligible side effects. This research demonstrates the potential of P4C6 to deliver two chemotherapeutic agents to  tumors to provide synergistic efficacy than single drug administration.Copyright © 2019 Li, Mao, Chen, Li, Wang and Mo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628914>Identification of novel Nrf2 target genes as prognostic biomarkers in colitis-associated colorectal  in Nrf2-deficient mice.</a></h1><p>Colorectal  (CRC) is the third most common  worldwide. Nuclear factor erythroid -related factor  (Nrf2), a master regulator of many cytoprotective genes, plays a protective role in carcinogenesis. Recent studies have identified a specific gene-expression signature regulated by the Nrf2 pathway in lung adenocarcinoma and head-and-neck squamous cell . However, the roles of Nrf2 in the development of colitis-associated colorectal  (CACC) have not been well characterized. Nrf2 target genes as prognostic biomarkers in CACC remain to be explored. Thus, this work aimed to identify the molecular changes that occur during mouse CACC progression to facilitate the development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.The CACC model was established using azoxymethane (AOM) with dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) in BALB/c mice for 3 weeks to induce colitis-associated adenoma (CAA, early stage) and for 9 weeks to induce colitis-associated carcinoma (CAC, late stage). Using RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics analyses we examined the mRNA expression profiles of 6 groups: wild-type control (WT-C), WT-CAA, WT-CAC, Nrf2 knockout control (Nrf2KO-C), Nrf2KO-CAA, and Nrf2KO-CAC.In the AOM/DSS model of colitis-associated tumorigenesis, Nrf2 mice showed a phenotype similar to WT mice, but with significantly more tumors and a much higher percentage of adenocarcinomas. We identified 47 novel Nrf2 genes via gene expression profiling of tumor samples. Survival analysis showed that 23 of these genes were biomarkers of a poor prognosis in  patients.Nrf2 target genes deserve exploration as prognostic and therapeutic targets for CRC.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of high dietary hemin on the promotion/progression stages of 1,-dimethylhydrazine (1,-DMH)-induced  carcinogenesis. Twenty-four Wistar male rats were given four subcutaneous 1,-DMH injections and received either balanced diet or balanced diet supplemented with hemin 0.5 mmol/kg for 23 weeks.  specimens were analyzed for aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and tumor development. Dietary hemin significantly increased ACF number and fecal water cytotoxicity/genotoxicity in Caco- cells when compared to 1,-DMH control group. However, tumor incidence, multiplicity and cell proliferation did not differ between 1,-DMH + hemin and 1,-DMH control group. Gene expression analysis of 91 target-genes revealed that only three genes (Figf, Pik3r5 and Tgfbr2) were down-regulated in the tumors from hemin-fed rats compared to those from 1,-DMH control group. Therefore, the findings of this study show that high hemin intake promotes mainly DNA damage and ACF development and but does not change the number nor incidence of  tumors induced by 1,-DMH in male rats.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, we examined the structure-activity relationships of isoflavones and isomeric flavone and flavanones as AhR ligands on the basis of their induction of CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and UGT1A1 gene expression in  Caco2 cells and young adult mouse colonocyte (YAMC) cells. Caco2 cells were significantly more Ah-responsive than YAMC cells, and this was due, in part, to flavonoid-induced cytotoxicity in the latter cell lines. The structure-activity relationships for the flavonoids were complex and both response and cell context specific; however, there was significant variability in the AhR activities of the isomeric substituted isoflavones and flavones. For example, 4',5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone (genistein) was AhR-inactive whereas 4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone (apigenin) induced CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and UGT1A1 in Caco2 cells. In contrast, both 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methoxy substituted isoflavone (biochanin A) and flavone (acacetin) induced all three AhR-responsive genes; 4',5,7-trimethoxyisoflavone was a potent AhR agonist, and the isomeric flavone was AhR-inactive. These results coupled with simulation studies modeling flavonoid interaction within the AhR binding pocket demonstrate that the orientation of the substituted phenyl ring at C- (flavones) or C-3 (isoflavones) on the common 4--chromen-4-one ring strongly influences the activities of isoflavones and flavones as AhR agonists.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624724>15-Deoxy-Δ-prostaglandin J Upregulates the Expression of 15-Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenase by Inducing AP-1 Activation and Heme Oxygenase-1 Expression in Human  Cells.</a></h1><p>Abnormal upregulation of prostaglandin E (PGE) is considered to be a key oncogenic event in the development and progression of inflammation-associated human . It has been reported that 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), an enzyme catabolizing PGE, is ubiquitously downregulated in human . 15-Deoxy-Δ-prostaglandin J (15d-PGJ), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ ligand, has been shown to have anticarcinogenic activities. In this study, we investigate the effect of 15d-PGJ on expression of 15-PGDH in human  HCT116 cells.HCT116 cells were treated with 15d-PGJ analysis. The expression of 15-PGDH in the treated cells was measured by Western blot analysis and RT-PCR. In addition, the cells were subjected to a 15-PGDH activity assay. To determine which transcription factor(s) and signaling pathway(s) are involved in 15d-PGJ-induced 15-PGDH expression, we performed a cDNA microarray analysis of 15d-PGJ-treated cells. The DNA binding activity of AP-1 was measured by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. To determine whether the AP-1 plays an important role in the 15d-PGJ-induced 15-PGDH expression, the cells were transfected with siRNA of c-Jun, a major subunit of AP-1. To elucidate the upstream signaling pathways involved in AP-1 activation by 15d-PGJ, we examined its effect on phosphorylation of Akt by Western blot analysis in the presence or absence of kinase inhibitor.15d-PGJ (10 μM) significantly upregulated 15-PGDH expression at the mRNA and protein levels in HCT-116 cells. 15-PGDH activity was also elevated by 15d-PGJ. We observed that genes encoding C/EBP delta, FOS-like antigen 1, c-Jun, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were most highly induced in the HCT116 cells following 15d-PGJ treatment. 15d-PGJ increased the DNA binding activity of AP-1. Moreover, transfection with specific siRNA against c-Jun significantly reduced 15-PGDH expression induced by 15d-PGJ. 15d-PGJ activates Akt and a pharmacological inhibitor of Akt, LY294002, abrogated 15d-PGJ-induced 15-PGDH expression. We also observed that an inhibitor of HO-1, zinc protoporphyrin IX, also abrogated upregulation of 15-PGDH and down-regulation of cyclooxygenase- expression induced by 15d-PGJ.These finding suggest that 15d-PGJ upregulates the expression of 15-PGDH through AP-1 activation in  HCT116 cells.Copyright © 2019 Korean Society of  Prevention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621072>miR-298 plays a pivotal role in  invasiveness by targeting PTEN.</a></h1><p>Evidence indicate that the miR-298 dysregulation might associate with colorectal  (CRC) development. Herein, we evaluated the effect of miR-298 dysregulation on  invasiveness. First, metabolic activity, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and invasion of miR-298 overexpressed/knocked out  cells were examined and combined with their transcriptome analysis data for better visualization of miR-298 intracellular signaling networks. Interaction between miR-298 and its target was evaluated with luciferase assay and validated using western blot analysis. The proportion of abnormal miR-298 level was investigated in tumor samples, matched normal adjacent tissues, and plasmas of 100 CRC patients, and also compared with 100 normal plasma samples. The Mann-Whitney U test was performed to assess miR-298 differences among the studied groups, and the correlation between miR-298 and the risk of CRC was shown by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The data indicate that miR-298 overexpression promoted proliferation and metastasis in CRC cells via targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog. Comparative analysis of CRC tumors, normal adjacent tissues, and plasmas indicated a significant miR-298 upregulation in tumors and plasmas (1.72-fold and 1.65-fold, respectively; p < .001). Also, the aberrant level of miR-298 contributed with CRC tumor differentiation, TNM stage and lymph node metastasis (p < .001), and independently associated with poor survival of CRC patients (p < .029; hazard ratio: 1.292; 95% confidence interval: 0.339-.184). Collectively, these data showed that abnormal level of miR-298 correlated with  development and through that lowered the overall survival rate of CRC patients. Therefore, miR-298 could be considered as a therapeutic target for CRC.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637604>Select group of patients might benefit from early colonoscopic screening for colorectal .</a></h1><p>Recently, the American  Society made a qualified recommendation to start colorectal  (CRC) screening at 45 years of age in all average-risk individuals. In this study, our primary aim is to calculate the prevalence and also evaluate the predictors of increased prevalence of detected adenomas in the 40-49-year-old individuals undergoing colonoscopy.A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed using our endoscopy database. Study subjects included all 40-49-year-old patients undergoing their first colonoscopy at our institution from January 1, 2010 to September 30, 2017. Exclusion criteria included patients who underwent colonoscopy for overt gastrointestinal bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease, a history of familial adenomatous polyposis, hereditary non-polyposis CRC. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were performed to identify factors associated with increased adenoma detection rate (ADR).A total of 2059 patients were included in the study, and 317 of these patients had family history (FH) of CRC. Patients with FH of CRC had significantly higher ADR (27.8% vs. 19.7%, p = 0.001) as compared to those without FH of CRC. There was no significant difference in ADR in patients between 40-44 years and 45-49 years of age (17.7% vs. 21.4%, p = 0.058). On a multivariate analysis while adjusting for multiple patient and procedural variables, FH of CRC, male sex, BMI > 30 kg/m, chronic kidney disease, and age were associated with high ADR.Our study shows that in addition to FH of CRC, age, male sex, BMI, and CKD are independent predictors of increased ADR in patients between 40 and 49 years of age.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559373>All-in-one Raman spectroscopy approach to diagnosis of colorectal : analysis of spectra in the fingerprint regions.</a></h1><p>Raman spectroscopy yields precise information, not only regarding the secondary structure of proteins but also regarding the discrimination between normal and malignant tissues. There is, however, no standard measurement method. We evaluated the use of a miniaturized, handheld, all-in-one Raman spectrometer with a 1064-nm laser excitation source for the diagnosis of colorectal . The ultimate goal is real-time, in vivo diagnosis.Tissue samples were obtained from 20 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal . The samples were irradiated with the portable Progeny™ Raman spectrometer, with which the Raman spectra were also obtained. We searched for characteristic Raman shifts and examined whether these shifts could distinguish the  tissues. To improve accuracy, we divided the spectra into 100 cm bands and applied principal component analysis (PCA) to each range. We evaluated the contribution of each range for  discrimination.Intensities at 1261 and 1427 cm differed significantly between the normal tissues and  tissues, but these did not efficiently discriminate the  tissues. However, we were able to identify the characteristic spectral range in fingerprint regions; accuracy was 85.1%.Use of the all-in-one type Raman spectrometer can efficiently discriminate colorectal , not on the basis of the intensities at 1261 and 1427 cm but rather on the basis of PCA. Thus, Raman spectroscopy performed using a handheld device has potential to become a clinically powerful tool for producing high-quality data, obtaining highly reproducible measurements, and thus accurately diagnosing colorectal .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566140>In Vitro Antitumor Evaluation of Some Hybrid Molecules Containing Coumarin and Quinolinone Moieties.</a></h1><p>Hybrid molecules furnished by merging two or more pharmacophores is an emerging concept in the field of medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. Currently, coumarin hybrids have attracted the keen attention of researchers to discover their therapeutic capability against .The present study aimed to evaluate in vitro antitumor activity of a new series of hybrid molecules containing coumarin and quinolinone moieties 4 and 5 against four  cell lines.A new series of hybrid molecules containing coumarin and quinolinone moieties 4a-c and 5a-c was synthesized and screened for their cytotoxicity against Prostate PC-3, Breast MCF-7,  HCT-116 and liver HepG2  cell lines as well as normal breast Hs-371 T.All the synthesized compounds were assessed for their in vitro antiproliferative activity against four  cell lines and several compounds were found to be active. Further in vitro cell cycle study of compounds 4a and 5a revealed MCF-7 cells arrest at G  /M phase of the cell cycle profile and induction apoptosis at pre-G1 phase. The apoptosis inducing activity was evidenced by up regulation of Bax protein together with the down regulation of the expression of Bcl- protein. The mechanism of cytotoxic activity of compunds 4a and 5a correlated to its topoisomerase II inhibitory activity.Hybrid molecules containing coumarin and quinolinone moieties represents a scaffold for further optimization to obtain promising anticancer agents.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615671>Aspergillus nidulans thermostable arginine deiminase-Dextran conjugates with enhanced molecular stability, proteolytic resistance, pharmacokinetic properties and anticancer activity.</a></h1><p>The potential anticancer activity of arginine deiminase (ADI) via deimination of l-arginine into citrulline has been extensively verified against various arginine-auxotrophic tumors, however, the higher antigenicity, structural instability and in vivo proteolysis are the major challenges that limit this enzyme from further clinical implementation. Since, this clinically applied enzyme was derived from Mycobacterium spp, thus, searching for ADI from eukaryotic microbes "especially thermophilic fungi" could have a novel biochemical, conformational and catalytic properties. Aspergillus nidulans ADI was purified with 5.3 folds, with molecular subunit structure 48 kDa and entire molecular mass 120 kDa, ensuring its homotrimeric identity. The peptide fingerprinting analysis revealing the domain Glu-Gly-Gly as the conserved active site of A. nidulans ADI, with higher proximity to Mycobacterium ADI clade IV. In an endeavor to fortify the structural stability and anticancer activity of A. nidulans ADI, the enzyme was chemically modified with dextran. The optimal activity of Dextran-ADI conjugates was determined at 0.08:20 M ratio of ADI: Dextran, with an overall increase to ADI molecular subunit mass to ˜100 kDa. ADI was conjugated with dextran via the ε-amino groups interaction of surface lysine residues of ADI. The resistance of Dextran-ADI conjugate to proteolysis had been increased by .5 folds to proteinase K and trypsin, suggesting the shielding of >50% of ADI surface proteolytic recognition sites. The native and Dextran-ADI conjugates have the same optimum reaction temperature (37 °C), reaction pH and pH stability (7.0-8.0) with dependency on K ions as a cofactor. Dextran-ADI conjugates exhibited a higher thermal stability by ˜  folds for all the tested temperatures, ensuring the acquired structural and catalytic stability upon dextran conjugation. Dextran conjugation slightly protect the reactive amino and thiols groups of surface amino acids of ADI from amino acids suicide inhibitors. The affinity of ADI was increased by 5.3 folds to free L-arginine with a dramatic reduction in citrullination of peptidylarginine residues upon dextran conjugation. The anticancer activity of ADI to breast (MCF-7), liver (HepG-) and  (HCT8, HT29, DLD1 and LS174 T)  cell lines was increased by 1.7 folds with dextran conjugation in vitro. Pharmacokinetically, the half-life time of ADI was increased by 1.7 folds upon dextran conjugation, in vivo. From the biochemical and hematological parameters, ADIs had no signs of toxicity to the experimental animals. In addition to the dramatic reduction of L-arginine in serum, citrulline level was increased by .5 folds upon dextran conjugation of ADI. This is first report exploring thermostable ADI from thermophilic A. nidulans with robust structural stability, catalytic efficiency and proteolytic resistance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Because trifluridine (FTD)/tipiracil therapy is used for refractory colorectal , we sought to determine whether FTD is effective against CSC-like cells. CD44CD133 high-expressing and other populations of human DLD-1  cells were separately isolated through fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The sphere-forming activity of each population and the anti-sphere-forming effects of FTD and fluorouracil (5-FU) on CD44CD133 cells were then measured. CD44CD133 DLD-1 cells formed substantially more spheres than other cells. Moreover, treating CD44CD133 DLD-1 cells with subtoxic concentrations of FTD (1 µM) inhibited sphere formation, and this was superior to the effect of subtoxic concentrations (1 µM) of 5-FU. The associated inhibition rates for FTD and 5-FU were 58.% and 26.1%, respectively. Further, CD44CD133 DLD-1 cells expressed higher levels of thymidine kinase 1, which is responsible for FTD phosphorylation, than DLD-1 cells, and FTD was incorporated into the DNA of CD44CD133 DLD-1 cells. Thus, our data show that FTD treatment is effective against CSC-like cells and might be applied as CSC-targeting chemotherapy for tumor subtypes with high CD44 and CD133 expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559366>Preoperative chemoradiotherapy using S-1 combined with celecoxib for advanced lower rectal : Phase I/II study.</a></h1><p>To clarify the safety and efficacy of celecoxib combined with chemoradiotherapy using S-1 for lower rectal .Twenty-one patients with pathologically proven lower rectal adenocarcinoma (cT3-T4, Tx N+, M0) were included in this study.

Five methods (mean treatment difference averaged over time, using a mixed-effects growth curve model; mixed-effects models for repeated measurements (MMRM); time-to-deterioration (TTD); status change; and responder analysis) were used to analyze EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status (GHS)/QoL and scores from functional scales.Overall, GHS/QoL and physical functioning deteriorated over time. Mean treatment difference slightly favored nintedanib over placebo for physical functioning (adjusted mean, .66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-4.34) and social functioning (adjusted mean, .62; 95% CI, 0.66-4.47). GHS/QoL was numerically better with nintedanib versus placebo (adjusted mean, 1.61; 95% CI, -0.004 to 3.27). MMRM analysis had similar results, with better physical functioning in the nintedanib group at all timepoints. There was no significant delay in GHS/QoL deterioration (10%) and physical functioning (16%) with nintedanib versus placebo (TTD analysis). Status change analysis showed a higher proportion of patients with markedly improved GHS/QoL and physical functioning in the nintedanib versus placebo groups.

The Naples prognostic score, based on inflammatory and nutritional statuses, is a useful prognostic marker in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal ; however, its significance in patients with metastatic colorectal  remains unclear.We aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of the Naples prognostic factor in patients with metastatic colorectal  receiving first-line chemotherapy and to compare its prognostic accuracy with the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, platelet:lymphocyte ratio, and the systemic immune-inflammatory index.This was a retrospective study of prospectively collected data.This study was conducted at a university hospital.A total of 259 patients received first-line systemic chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal .The Naples prognostic score was calculated by a composite score of albumin and cholesterol concentrations, lymphocyte:monocyte ratio, and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio. The patients were divided into 3 groups based on increasing Naples scores (groups 0-), and the associations of the Naples prognostic score with clinicopathologic features and overall survival were evaluated.Higher Naples prognostic score was positively associated with right-sided primary tumors and synchronous metastases and negatively with primary tumor resection. Patients in group  (high Naples prognostic score) had significantly shorter overall survival than those in groups 0 and 1 (p = 0.012 and 0.022). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified the Naples prognostic score as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (HR = 1.574; p = 0.004). Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that Naples prognostic score was more sensitive than other prognostic factors for predicting overall survival.The main limitations are the sample size, single institutional feature, and treatment heterogeneity.The Naples prognostic score may be a useful prognostic marker in patients with metastatic colorectal  receiving systemic chemotherapy.

Moreover, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were observed in three  cell lines. Rh2HAZnO induced apoptotic process through p53-mediated pathway by upregulating p53 and BAX and downregulating BCL2. Specifically, Rh2HAZnO induced activation of cleaved PARP (Asp214) in A549 lung  cells and upregulated Caspase-9/phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in other cell lines (HT29 and MCF-7). Furthermore, Rh2HAZnO induced morphological changes in the nucleus of these cell lines.These results suggest that the potential anticancer activity of novel Rh2HAZnO nanoparticles might be linked to induction of apoptosis through the generation of ROS by activation of the Caspase-9/p38 MAPK pathway.© 2019 Kim et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661292>Unmasking the interplay between mTOR and Nox4: novel insights into the mechanism connecting diabetes and .</a></h1><p> was recently annexed to diabetic complications.

Consequently, diabetes and  share many risk factors, but the cellular and molecular pathways correlating diabetes and  and rectal  (CRC) remain far from understood. In this study, we assess the effect of hyperglycemia on  cell aggressiveness in human  epithelial adenocarcinoma cells  and in an experimental animal model of CRC. Our results show that Nox (NADPH oxidase enzyme) 4-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is deregulated in both diabetes and CRC. This is paralleled by inactivation of the AMPK and activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) C1 signaling pathways, resulting in 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) accumulation, induction of DNA damage, and exacerbation of  cell aggressiveness, thus contributing to the genomic instability and predisposition to increased tumorigenesis in the diabetic milieu. Pharmacologic activation of AMPK, inhibition of mTORC1, or blockade of Nox4 reduce ROS production, restore the homeostatic signaling of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase/8-oxodG, and lessen the progression of CRC malignancy in a diabetic milieu. Taken together, our results identify the AMPK/mTORC1/Nox4 signaling axis as a molecular switch correlating diabetes and CRC.

Fusions in R-spondin genes have been found in TSAs, but it is not clear whether these are sufficient for TSA development, due to the lack of a chromosome engineering platform for human tissues. We studied the effects of fusions in R-spondin genes and other genetic alterations found in TSA using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated chromosome and genetic modification of human  organoids.We introduced chromosome rearrangements that involve R-spondin genes into human  organoids, with or without disruption of TP53, using CRISPR-Cas9 (chromosome-engineered organoids). We then knocked a mutation into BRAF encoding the V600E substitution and overexpressed the GREM1 transgene; the organoids were transplanted into colons of NOG mice and growth of xenograft tumors was measured.  tissues were collected and analyzed by immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization. We also established  patient-derived TSA organoid lines and characterized their genetic features and phenotypes. We inserted a bicistronic cassette expressing a dimerizer-inducible suicide gene and fluorescent marker downstream of the LGR5 gene in the chromosome-engineered organoids; addition of the dimerizer eradicates LGR5 cells. Some tumor-bearing mice were given intraperitoneal injections of the dimerizer to remove LGR5-expressing cells.Chromosome engineering of organoids required disruption of TP53 or culture in medium containing IGF1 and FGF2. In colons of mice, organoids that expressed BRAF and fusions in R-spondin genes formed flat serrated lesions. Patient-derived TSA organoids grew independent of exogenous R-spondin, and 1 line grew independent of Noggin. Organoids that overexpressed GREM1, in addition to BRAF and fusions in R-spondin genes, formed polypoid tumors in mice that had similar histologic features to TSAs. Xenograft tumors persisted after loss of LGR5-expressing cells.We demonstrated efficient chromosomal engineering of human normal  organoids. We introduced genetic and chromosome alterations into human  organoids found in human TSAs; tumors grown from these organoids in mice had histopathology features of TSAs.

Inter- and intra-heterogeneity of tumors contribute to why some individuals do not respond to specific  therapies or may often suffer a relapse.Our study applies an in vitro drug test system for simulating treatment with cytostatics of colorectal  in elderly patients with dehydration condition.Two well-known  cell lines, Caco- and RKO, harboring defined -related mutations, were step-wisely adapted from routine culture medium to a severe hyperosmotic condition (397 mOmol/kg) by adding sodium chloride to the medium. We investigated the effects of these cell culture conditions, which should mimic cellular dehydration in elderly people, on the growth characteristics of the cells. Therefore, cell proliferation was investigated by measuring population doubling times. Furthermore, we investigated how the metabolic activity of the cells was influenced by treatment with different concentrations of cyclophosphamide (CPA) under normal and hyperosmotic conditions.We found that Caco- and RKO cell lines have an identical cell doubling time of 23 hours in normosmotic medium. However, hyperosmotic medium lifted the doubling time of Caco- cells to 31 hours while that of RKO cells did not change. Despite reduced cell proliferation rates, hyperosmotic medium sensitized Caco- cells to treatment with 10 mM CPA for 48 hours as measured by metabolic activity assays on ATP levels.The two investigated  cells lines reacted differently to hyperosmotic conditions. Only the growth of Caco- cells was reduced by increased osmolality. Despite this reduced growth their sensitivity to an alkylating cytostatic agent was even slightly increased.

More importantly, as a monotherapy, DaRT has been shown to induce a systemic antitumor immune response following tumor ablation. Here, immunomodulatory strategies to boost the antitumor immune response induced by DaRT, and the response specificity, were investigated in the  CT26 mouse model. Local treatment prior to DaRT, with the TLR3 agonist poly I:C, was sufficient to inhibit tumor growth relative to poly I:C or DaRT alone. DaRT used in combination with the TLR9 agonist CpG, or with the TLR1/ agonist XS15 retarded tumor growth and increased tumor-rejection rates, compared to DaRT alone, curing 41% and 20% of the mice, respectively. DaRT in combination with CpG, the Treg inhibitor cyclophosphamide, and the MDSC inhibitor sildenafil, cured 51% of the animals, compared to only 6% and 0% cure when immunomodulation or DaRT was used alone, respectively. Challenge and Winn assays revealed that these high cure rates involved a specific immunological memory against CT26 antigens. We suggest that DaRT acts in synergy with immunomodulation to induce a specific and systemic antitumor immune response. This strategy may serve as a safe and efficient method not only for tumor ablation, but also for in situ vaccination of  patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622737>Risk Factors Associated With Early-onset Colorectal .</a></h1><p>The incidence of colorectal  (CRC) is increasing in individuals younger than 50 years, who do not usually undergo screening if they are of average risk. We sought to identify risk factors for CRC in this population.We compared sociodemographic and medical characteristics of patients who received a diagnosis of CRC at an age of 18-49 years (early-onset) with patients who received a diagnosis of CRC at an age of 50 years or older (late-onset) and with age-matched, -free individuals (controls) at a tertiary academic hospital. We collected data from all adult patients with a diagnosis of CRC from January 1, 2011 through April 3, 2017 from electronic health records. Associations with risk factors were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models.We identified 269 patients with early-onset CRC, 2802 with late-onset CRC, and 1122 controls. Compared with controls, patients with early-onset CRC were more likely to be male (odds ratio [OR], 1.87; 95% CI, 1.39-.51), have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (3% vs 0.4% for controls; univariable P<.01), and have a family history of CRC (OR, 8.61; CI, 4.83-15.75). Prevalence values of well-established modifiable CRC risk factors, including obesity, smoking, and diabetes, were similar. Compared to patients with late-onset CRC, patients with early-onset CRC were more likely to be male (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.11-1.87), black (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.08-.65) or Asian (OR, .60; 95% CI, 1.57-4.15), and have IBD (OR, .97; 95% CI, 1.16-6.63) or a family history of CRC (OR, .87; 95% CI, 1.89-4.25). Sensitivity analyses excluding IBD and family history of CRC showed comparable results. Early-onset CRC was more likely than late-onset disease to be detected in the left  or rectum (75% vs 59%, P=.02) and at a late stage of tumor development (77% vs 62%, P=.01).In a retrospective study of patients with early-onset CRC vs late-onset CRC or no , we identified non-modifiable risk factors, including sex, race, IBD, and family history of CRC, to be associated with early-onset CRC.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

The contribution of 1O2 and ˙OH to DNA degradation was proved using gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, the pronounced generation of ROS by mouse  carcinoma cells (CT26) stimulated by both copper(ii) complexes was confirmed. A fluorescence method allowed the total amounts of ROS generated inside the CT26 cells to be detected, while the spin trapping technique proved that free radicals mainly attached to the membrane surface. These last results are in agreement with the data obtained from the ICP-MS method, which demonstrates that 1Cu and 2Cu complexes are not efficiently accumulated inside the cell. Furthermore, the role of ROS in lipid peroxidation was established. The above-mentioned factors may clearly indicate the contribution of ROS generated by the studied copper(ii) complexes to  cell damage, which can lead to a carcinogenesis process.

The analysis was performed for progression-free survival and overall survival according to the sidedness and other known prognostic factors.Out of 53 patients treated with triplet therapy, 11 had right sided and 42 had left-sided primaries. The median age for right-sided primaries was 46 (range 24-55) compared to 53 (range 32-74) in left-sided primaries. Median progression-free survival was 14 months for right vs 18 months for left sided tumors (Hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.27-1.88, p=0.492) and median overall survival was 21 months for right vs 29 months for left sided tumors (Hazard ratio was 0.86, 95% CI 0.32-.26, p=0.752).First-line triplet chemotherapy may overcome the difference in prognosis between right sided and left sided primaries in metastatic colorectal .

This study aimed to study the travel distance to  patient's GP and to the hospital of diagnosis and the association with tumour stage for 12  types. A cohort study was conducted including  patients in Denmark diagnosed between 2005 and 2016 with rectum, malignant melanoma, breast, testis, oesophageal, , cervix, prostate, stomach, pancreatic, lung and ovary  (n = 256,663). Distance to each patient's GP and to the hospital of diagnosis were calculated using ArcGIS, Network Analyst. The results showed that for most easy-to-diagnose  types (rectum , malignant melanoma, testis ) and cervix , increasing travel distance to the hospital of diagnosis increased the odds of advanced disease at diagnosis. Contrary, increasing travel distance to the hospital was associated with decreased odds of being diagnosed with advanced disease stage among hard-to-diagnose  types (stomach, pancreatic, lung and ovarian ), and prostate . Distance to the GP was overall not associated with tumour stage. The underlying mechanisms for these findings are multifaceted and might reflect differences in presentation, symptomologies and investigations used for diagnosis across  types.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We sought to determine the feasibility of a high GLV dietary intervention in adults with an increased risk of CC () via a 12-week randomized controlled crossover trial. Participants were randomized to immediate or delayed (post-4-week washout) intervention groups. During the 4-week intervention period, participants were given frozen GLVs and counseled to consume one cooked cup equivalent daily. The primary outcomes were: accrual-recruiting 50 adults in 9 months; retention-retaining 80% of participants at completion; and adherence-meeting GLV intake goals on 90% of days. Adherence data were collected twice weekly and 24-h dietary recalls at each time point provided nutrient and food group measures. The Food Acceptability Questionnaire (FAQ) was completed to determine acceptability. On each of the four study visits, anthropometrics, stool, saliva, and blood were obtained. Fifty adults were recruited in 44 days. Participants were 48 ± 13 years of age, 62% female, and 80% Caucasian, with an average BMI at screening of 35.9 ± 5.1. Forty-eight (96%) participants were retained and completed the study. During the intervention phase, participants consumed GLVs on 88.8% of days; the adherence goal of one cup was met on 73.% of days. Dietary recall-derived Vitamin K and GLVs significantly increased for all participants during the intervention periods. Overall satisfaction did not differ between intervention and control periods ( = 0.214). This feasibility trial achieved accrual, retention and acceptability goals, but fell slightly short of the benchmark for adherence.

In this paper, we considered the probable relationship between the presence of  in the  and its possible influence on the development of colorectal . For this purpose, intracellular and/or extracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mouse  carcinoma cells (CT26) was stimulated by two fragments of FomA adhesin from  and their complexes with copper(II): Cu(II)-Ac-KGHGNG-NH () and Cu(II)-Ac-PTVHNE-NH (). Incubation of the cells with copper complexes was followed with ICP-MS technique. The overall generation of ROS was shown by means of fluorescence spectroscopy with two proper probes, whereas identification of ROS was achieved by the spin trapping technique and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements. As a result, an abundant production of the hydroxyl radicals, both inside and outside the cells, was observed upon the stimulation of the CT26 cells with the copper complexes. Clearly both compounds induced strong oxidation stress which triggered a radicals' cascade that finally resulted in the pronounced lipid peroxidation. The latter was evidenced with the measured level of malondialdehyde, a biomarker of the peroxidation process. By applying -acetylcysteine antioxidant to the studied system, the free radical mechanism of the lipid peroxidation process was confirmed. Hypothetically this mechanism can lead to  cell damage and further cancerogenesis processes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652358>Predicted Basal Metabolic Rate and  Risk in the European Prospective Investigation into  and Nutrition (Epic).</a></h1><p>Emerging evidence suggests that a metabolic profile associated with obesity may be a more relevant risk factor for some cancers than adiposity per se. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is an indicator of overall body metabolism and may be a proxy for the impact of a specific metabolic profile on  risk. Therefore, we investigated the association of estimated BMR with incidence of 13 obesity-related cancers in the European Prospective Investigation into  and Nutrition. Estimated BMR at baseline was calculated using the WHO/FAO/UNU equations and the relationships between BMR and  risk were investigated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. A total of 141,295 men and 317,613 women, with a mean follow-up of 14 years were included in the analysis. Overall, higher BMR was associated with a greater risk for most cancers that have been linked with obesity. However, among normal weight participants, higher BMR was associated with elevated risks of esophageal adenocarcinoma (Hazard Ratio per 1-standard deviation change in BMR [HR ]: .46; 95%CI 1.20; 5.03), and distal  (HR : 1.33; 95%CI 1.001; 1.77) among men, and with proximal  (HR : 1.16; 95%CI 1.01; 1.35), pancreatic (HR : 1.37; 95%CI 1.13; 1.66), thyroid (HR : 1.65; 95%CI 1.33; .05), postmenopausal breast (HR : 1.17; 95%CI 1.11; 1.22), and endometrial (HR : 1.20; 95%CI 1.03; 1.40) cancers in women. These results indicate that higher BMR may be an indicator of a metabolic phenotype associated with risk of certain  types, and may be a useful predictor of  risk independent of body fatness.

SNP genotyping assays of rs2240308 were performed and family history of  in individuals with hypodontia was documented In silico analysis was implemented to define the genomic profile of the AXIN2 gene associated with CRC. Multivariate analysis, chi square, odd ratio tests, and R software were used for statistical analysis.AXIN2 rs2240308 showed association with CRC (OR = 5.4 CI: .7-10.4;  < 0.001) and with other familial  in individuals with hypodontia ( < 0.005 OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.22-6.91). In silico analysis showed that variations in AXIN2 found in CRC patients, were more frequently in earlier stages of tumor and patients who carry variations in the AXIN2 gene have a worse prognosis ( < 0.05). The association between AXIN2 rs2240308 with hypodontia was not significant.These results suggest that AXIN2 rs2240308 polymorphism is associated with CRC and AXIN2 could be a risk marker for predisposition and prognosis of CRC.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616693>Giant squamous cell carcinoma of the gallbladder: A case report.</a></h1><p>Gallbladder  is the most common malignant tumor of the biliary tract.

Many patients are at an advanced stage when diagnosed and have bad therapeutic efficacy.A 45-year-old male patient presented with left flank pain for 1 year and irradiated to the mesogastric region. He denied fever, vomiting, and any other intestinal changes. He reported a weight loss of 10 kg in a period of 7 mo. He denied alcoholism, smoking, drug use, or prior illness. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed in the gallbladder fossa a voluminous mesogastric heterogeneous collection that had a thick and irregular capsule with liquid and gaseous contents. A predominantly hypoattenuating rounded material with partially calcified margins measuring about .0 cm related to gallstone was also emphasized. No lymphadenomegalies or free fluid was observed in the abdominal cavity. Patient underwent laparotomy where a huge tumor was observed affecting the transverse  and gallbladder. This mass was resected en bloc removing gallbladder and transverse  together with corresponding mesocolon and regional lymphadenectomy. There were no complications in the postoperative period. Although oncological treatment was performed, the patient died 6 mo after surgery.Squamous cell carcinoma represents a rare disease. Patients often present with large, bulky tumors with involvement of adjacent organs.

We used multiplexed mass spectrometry to collect high-content information on protein phosphorylation in two different mouse models of IBD. Because the biological function of the vast majority of phosphorylation sites remains unknown, we developed Substrate-based Kinase Activity Inference (SKAI), a methodology to infer kinase activity from phosphoproteomic data. This approach draws upon prior knowledge of kinase-substrate interactions to construct custom lists of kinases and their respective substrate sites, termed kinase-substrate sets that employ prior knowledge across organisms. This expansion as much as triples the amount of prior knowledge available. We then used these sets within the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis framework to infer kinase activity based on increased or decreased phosphorylation of its substrates in a dataset. When applied to the phosphoproteomic datasets from the two mouse models, SKAI predicted largely non-overlapping kinase activation profiles. These results suggest that chronic inflammation may arise through activation of largely divergent signaling networks. However, the one kinase inferred to be activated in both mouse models was mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase  (MAPKAPK2 or MK2), a serine/threonine kinase that functions downstream of p38 stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase. Treatment of mice with active colitis with ATI450, an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of the MK2 pathway, reduced inflammatory signaling in the  and alleviated the clinical and histological features of inflammation. These studies establish MK2 as a therapeutic target in IBD and identify ATI450 as a potential therapy for the disease.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

We evaluated the costs and benefits of testing for Lynch syndrome and determined the optimal surveillance interval for first-degree relatives (FDRs) found to have Lynch syndrome.We developed a patient flow diagram to determine costs and yield of immunohistochemical testing for Lynch syndrome in CRC cases and, for those found to have Lynch syndrome, their FDRs, accounting for realistic uptake. Subsequently, we used the MISCAN- model to compare costs and benefits of annual, biennial, and triennial surveillance in FDRs identified with Lynch syndrome vs colonoscopy screening every 10 years (usual care for individuals without a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome).Testing 1000 CRC cases was estimated to identify 20 CRC index cases and 29 FDRs with Lynch syndrome at a cost of $310,274. Despite the high cost of Lynch syndrome tests, offering the FDRs with Lynch syndrome biennial colonoscopy surveillance was cost effective at $8785 per life-year gained compared with usual care, due to a substantial increase in life-years gained (+122%) and cost savings in CRC care. Triennial surveillance was more costly and less effective, and annual surveillance showed limited additional benefit compared with biennial surveillance.Immunohistochemical testing for Lynch syndrome in persons younger than 70 years who received a diagnosis of colorectal , and then testing first-degree relatives of those found to have Lynch syndrome, provides a good balance between costs and long-term benefits.

Meanwhile, we performed a rescue experiment by treating cells with the ERK pathway activator LM22B-10 prior to treatment of cells with 5.1% sevoflurane。 KEY FINDINGS: High concentration (5.1%) of sevoflurane significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of cells, causing G0/G1 phase arrest and promoted apoptosis and autophagy. 5.1% sevoflurane can participate in the regulation of EMT by regulating the expression of E-cadherin, Vimentin and N-cadherin proteins. LM22B-10 promoted proliferation and invasion of  cells and inhibited apoptosis and autophagy, while 5.1% sevoflurane could reverse the effect of LM22B-10 on the biological characteristics of cells. Sevoflurane can significantly inhibit tumor growth in SW480 cells transplanted nude mice.

The OS rate in the miR-4709 low expression group was significantly higher than that in the miR-4709 high expression group. Univariate and multivariate analyses exhibited that miR-4709 expression was an independent adverse prognostic factor. Exogenous miR-4709 overexpression promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion of LOVO and SW480 cells. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assay demonstrated that miR-4709 directly binds to the 3'-untranslated region of NR3C2. NR3C2 was lowly expressed in COAD and high expression of NR3C2 had a better prognosis compared with that in the low expression of NR3C2. Correlation analysis showed that there is a close association between the level of expression of NR3C2 and miR-4709. Accordingly, miR-4709 may function as an oncogene in COAD and provide a preclinical proof for candidate management to target new miR-4709-NR3C2 signaling for COAD therapy.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590275>Metastatic Lymph Node Ratio (mLNR) is a Useful Parameter in the Prognosis of Colorectal ; A Meta-Analysis for the Prognostic Role of mLNR.</a></h1><p> The presenting study aimed to elucidate the prognostic role of the metastatic lymph node ratio (mLNR) in patients with colorectal  (CRC), using a meta-analysis.  Using data from 90,274 patients from 14 eligible studies, we performed a meta-analysis for the correlation between mLNR and survival rate. Besides, subgroup analyses were performed, based on tumor stage, tumor location, and mLNR.  A high mLNR showed significant correlation with worse overall survival and disease-free survival rates in CRC patients (hazard ratio (HR), 1.617, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.393-1.877, and HR .345, 95% CI 1.879-.926, respectively). In patients with stage III, who had regional LN metastasis, the HRs were 1.730 (95% CI 1.266-.362) and .451 (95% CI 1.719-3.494) for overall and disease-free survival, respectively. According to tumor location, rectal  showed a worse survival rate when compared to . In the analysis for overall survival, when mLNR was 0., HR was the highest across the different subgroups (HR 5.040, 95% CI 1.780-14.270). However, in the analysis for disease-free survival, the subgroup with an mLNR < 0. had a higher HR than the other subgroups (HR .878, 95% CI 1.401-5.912).  The mLNR may be a useful prognostic factor for patients with CRC, regardless of the tumor stage or tumor location. Further studies are necessary for the detailed criteria of mLNR before its application in daily practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631167>[A Case of Sigmoid  Accompanied by Intestinal Malrotation Treated by Laparoscopic Surgery].</a></h1><p>A 52-year-old man whose fecal occult blood test was positive was found to have type  sigmoid  by colonoscopy. On enhanced barium enema study, the cecum was in the pelvis, and the ascending  was running medially in the abdomen. Enhanced CT scan of the abdomen revealed rotation of the superior mesenteric vein(SMV). We diagnosed the case as sigmoid (cT3N0M0, StageⅡA)with non rotation-type intestinal malrotation, and performed laparoscopic surgery. We confirmed the small intestine to be located on the right side of the abdomen, the cecum to be located in the pelvis, and the ascending  to be running medially in the abdomen. The ascending mesocolon was adherent to the right of the sigmoid mesocolon. Following dissections of the ascending mesocolon from the sigmoid mesocolon, we performed surgery via the inside approach as usual. We dissected the root of the inferior mesenteric artery(IMA), and the operation was completed. In laparoscopic surgery for colorectal  with intestinal malrotation, there are some reports that it could be performed safely if attention is paid to adhesion of the mesenteries and vascular variation in the course of preoperative imaging diagnosis. We report a case of laparoscopic surgery that could be safely performed for sigmoid  with non rotation-type intestinal malrotation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602230>Knockdown of lncRNA CCEPR suppresses colorectal  progression.</a></h1><p>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve important roles in colorectal . The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression and role of cervical carcinoma expressed PCNA regulatory (CCEPR) lncRNA in colorectal  progression. The results demonstrated that CCEPR expression was significantly higher in colorectal  tissues when compared with paired adjacent normal tissues. In addition, CCEPR expression was significantly higher in patients with advanced colorectal  (stage III/IV) than those with early-stage colorectal  (stage I/II). High CCEPR expression was significantly associated with poor differentiation, advanced clinical stage, positive lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis. Of particular note, patients with colorectal  exhibiting high CCEPR expression levels had shorter survival rates when compared with patients with low CCEPR expression.  experiments demonstrated that the expression of CCEPR was increased in colorectal  cell lines when compared with a normal  cell line. Knockdown of CCEPR significantly inhibited colorectal  cell proliferation, colony formation and cell cycle progression, as well as cell migration and invasion. Finally, silencing of CCEPR downregulated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)- and MMP-9 expression and suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colorectal  cells. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that CCEPR may exert an oncogenic role in colorectal , and CCEPR may be a promising molecular target for colorectal  treatment.Copyright: © Duan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677446>Synthesis and biological evaluation of triterpenoid thiazoles derived from betulonic acid, dihydrobetulonic acid, and ursonic acid.</a></h1><p>In this work, 35 new derivatives of betulonic, dihydrobetulonic and ursonic acid were prepared including 30 aminothiazoles and all of them were tested for their in vitro cytotoxic activity in eight  cell lines and two non- fibroblasts.

We aimed to evaluate whether MSH3 loss is associated with EMAST in CRC.A consecutive cohort of patients with stage I-III CRC. Digital image analysis using heatmap-derived hot spots investigated MSH3 expression by immunohistochemistry. Fragment analysis of multiplex PCR was used to assess MSI and EMAST, and results cross-examined with MSH3 protein expression.Of 152 patients, EMAST was found in 50 (33%) and exclusively in the . Most EMAST-positive cancers had instability at all 5 markers, and EMAST overlapped with MSI-H in 42/50 cases (84%). The most frequently altered tetranucleotide markers were D8S321 (38.% of tumors) and D20S82 (34.4%). Subjective evaluation of MSH3 expression by IHC in tumor found ≤10% negative tumor cells in all samples, most being ≤5% negative. Digital analysis improved the detection but showed a similar spread of MSH3 loss (range 0.1-15.7%, mean .%). Hotspot MSH3 negativity ranged between 0.1 to 95.0%, (mean 8.6%) with significant correlation with the whole slide analysis (Spearman's rho=0.677 P<.001). Loss of MSH3 expression did not correlate with EMAST.In a well-defined cohort of patients with CRC, loss of MSH3 was not associated with EMAST.

Many theories assert that high perceived risk motivates health behavior change; the empirical literature shows mixed findings. . To determine whether, for whom, and under what circumstances specifying a future behavior when assessing perceived risk (i.e., "conditioning" risk perception items on behavior) improves data quality and strengthens the perceived risk-intentions/behavior relationship. . Internet panel participants ( = 787, 58.8% no college experience, 44.4% racial/ethnic minority, 43.7% men, 67.3% aged 18-49 years, 59.0% nonadherent to physical activity guidelines) answered 8  perceived risk items in a within-subjects design. Participants answered 4 types of risk perception items: absolute and comparative perceived likelihood and absolute and comparative feelings of risk. Participants answered each type of item twice: once conditioned on not engaging in physical activity and once unconditioned. . Compared to unconditioned items, conditioned items elicited fewer "don't know" (DK) responses (OR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68-0.93), higher risk perceptions ( = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.49-0.61) and stronger positive correlations with intentions ( = 5.46,  < 0.001) and behavior ( = 5.10,  < 0.001). The effect of conditioning was more pronounced for perceived likelihood than feelings of risk items (OR = .21; 95% CI, 1.63-3.01 and  = 0.14; 95% CI, 0.08-0.20 for DK responding and risk perception magnitude, respectively). The effect on risk perception magnitude (except absolute feelings of risk) was higher among people with higher health literacy (χ(3) = 8.11,  = 0.04). . Researchers who examine whether perceived risk motivates precautionary behavior should consider conditioning risk perception items on behavior to increase the validity of the statistical conclusions they draw and to gain insight into the nature of perceived risk and its relation to behavior.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664994>Obesity, diabetes and the risk of colorectal adenoma and .</a></h1><p>Colorectal  (CRC) is the fourth most commonly diagnosed gastrointestinal (GI) malignancy and the third leading cause of -related death worldwide. In the current case-control study, an association between diagnosis of CRC, obesity and diabetes was investigated.Demographic characteristics, colonoscopy reports, history of drug, smoking, and medical history were collected from patients referred to a colonoscopy unit. The location, size and number of the polyps were recorded during the colonoscopy. Statistically, t-test was conducted for mean comparison for the groups. Pearson's chi-squared test (χ) was applied to categorize variables. Five classification methods based on the important clinicopathological characteristics such as age, BMI, diabetes, family history of  was performed to predict the results of colonoscopy.Overall, 693 patients participated in this study. In the present study, 115 and 515 patients were evaluated for adenoma/adenocarcinoma and normal colonoscopy, respectively. The mean age of patients positive for adenoma or adenocarcinoma were significantly higher than the negative groups (p value < 0.001). Incidence of overweight and/or obesity (BMI > 25 kg/m2) were significantly higher in adenoma positive patients as compared to controls (49.9 and 0.9% respectively, p value = 0.04). The results also demonstrated a significant association between suffering from diabetes and having  adenoma (OR = 1.831, 95%CI = 1.058-3.169, p value = 0.023). The experimental results of 5 classification methods on higher risk factors between  adenoma and normal colonoscopy data were more than 82% and less than 0.42 for the percentage of classification accuracy and root mean squared error, respectively.In the current study, the occurrence of obesity measured based on BMI and diabetes in the adenoma positive patient group was significantly higher than the control group although there was no notable association between obesity, diabetes and adenocarcinoma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664942>Muir-Torre syndrome: sebaceous carcinoma concurrent with  in a kidney transplant recipient; a case report.</a></h1><p>Sebaceous carcinoma is a rare but progressive malignant skin , and the incidence is approximately five times higher in post-transplant patients than in people who have not received kidney transplants. Sebaceous carcinoma is sometimes found concurrently with visceral cancers and a genetic abnormality, Muir-Torre syndrome. We report the case of a female kidney transplant recipient with sebaceous carcinoma concurrent with  10 years after transplantation.A 43-year-old woman was admitted due to a rapidly progressive tumor on her head. Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as sebaceous carcinoma. We diagnosed her with Muir-Torre syndrome based on the following evidence: 1) high prevalence of microsatellite instability in gene locus assay, ) absence of mismatch repair proteins in the sebaceous carcinoma on immunohistochemical analysis, and 3) a genetic mutation of 1226_1227delAG in the MSH2 exon 7 in the lesion detected by DNA sequencing analysis. Several reports have shown an association between immunosuppressive agents and latent Muir-Torre syndrome progression. Therefore, the progression of  in this case originated from her genetic mutation for Muir-Torre syndrome and long-term use of immunosuppressive agents.This case report not only highlights the importance of adequate diagnosis and therapy for Muir-Torre syndrome, but also suggests the further prevention of the development of malignant tumors in kidney transplant recipients.

Only human studies were included. All dissection, angiographic, arterial cast and corrosion studies were analyzed.This review demonstrates that the right , the hepatic flexure and the right transverse  are vascularized by three significant arteries emerging from the SMA and forming one peripheral paracolic arc: (1) the ileocolic artery (ICA), the most constant vessel (99.8%) with low variability; () the right colic artery (RCA), the most inconstant vessel (/3 of cases) with high variability in its origin; and (3) the middle colic artery (MCA), a constant vessel (95%) with variation in its origin and its number. The marginal artery is almost constant (100%) and represents the only peripheral arterial arc at the level of the right side of the .Three arteries emerging from the superior mesenteric artery exist: the ICA, the RCA and the MCA. The ICA and the MCA are the most constant.

We performed logistic regression analysis to identify predictive factors for LNM. Both unadjusted and adjusted Cox regression analyses were used to determine the association between LNM and patient survival. Finally, we used competing risks analysis and the cumulative incidence function (CIF) to further confirm the prognostic role of LNM in -specific survival (CSS).The overall risk of LNM in patients with T1  was 12.0% (N = 967). Adjusted logistic regression models revealed that mucinous carcinoma [odds ratio (OR) = .26, P < 0.001], moderately differentiated (OR 1.74, P < 0.001), poorly differentiated (OR 5.16, P < 0.001), and undifferentiated carcinoma (OR 3.01, P = 0.003); older age (OR 0.66, P < 0.001 for age 65-79 years, OR 0.44, P < 0.001 for age over 80 years); and carcinoma located in the ascending  (OR 0.77, P = 0.018) and sigmoid  (OR 1.24, P = 0.014) were independent predictive factors for LNM. Adjusted Cox regression analysis showed that positive lymph node involvement was significantly associated with CSS [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.02, P < 0.001], which was further robustly confirmed using a competing risks model and the CIF.This population-based study showed that mucinous carcinoma, tumor grade, age, and primary tumor location were independent predictive factors for LNM in T1 .

European data are primarily reported by specialized referral centers and thus may not be representative of common European ESD practice. The aim of this study is to understand the current state of ESD practice across Italian endoscopy centers.All Italian endoscopists who were known to perform ESD were invited to complete a structured questionnaire including: operator features and competencies, ESD training details and clinical outcomes over a -year period.Twenty-nine operators from 23 centers (69% response rate) completed the questionnaire: 18 (62%) were <50 years old; 7 (24%) were female; 16 (70%) were located in Northern Italy. Overall ESD volume was <40 cases in 9 (31%) operators, 40-80 in 8 (27.5%), 80-150 in 4 (13.8%) and >150 in 8 (27.5%). Colorectal ESD was predominant for operators with an experience >80 cases. En-bloc resection rates ranged from 77. to 97.% depending on the anatomic location with an R0 resection rate range of 75.3-93.6%. ESD perforation rates in the  and rectum were significantly lower when experience was >150 compared to 80-150 cases (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.006 for  and rectum, respectively).ESD in Italy is performed by a significant number of operators. Overall, Italian endoscopists performing ESD have achieved a good competence level. However, there is much variability in training protocols, initial supervision of procedures, practice settings, case mix and procedural volume/year that are likely responsible for some of the suboptimal resectional outcomes and increased perforation risk, mainly in the .

The preferred initial and most widely used pharmacological agent for the treatment of type  diabetes is metformin, which in parallel reduces the risk of CRC and improves patient prognosis. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) appears to be tightly associated with the beneficial metabolic effects of metformin, serving as a cellular energy sensor activated in response to a variety of conditions that deplete cellular energy levels. Such conditions include nutrient starvation (particularly glucose), hypoxia and exposure to toxins that inhibit the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of metformin on CRC cell lines, with different levels of anterior gradient  (AGR2) expression, exposed to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin, alone or in combination with metformin. AGR2 has recently emerged as a factor involved in  carcinogenesis. In -knockout cells, markedly higher levels of phosphorylated-AMPK were observed in comparison with control cells transfected with -scrambled guide RNA, which indicated that the presence of AGR2 may interfere with the metformin-dependent activation of AMPK. In addition, metformin in combination with 5-FU and oxaliplatin induced ROS production and attenuated autophagy.

MATERIAL AND METHODS MTT assay and flow cytometry using Hoechst 33258 staining were used to assess cell proliferation and morphology, respectively. Changes in protein expression was determined by western blotting assay. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in DLD-1 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry using DCFH-DA (',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate) stain. RESULTS DLD-1 and HCT-116 cell viability was suppressed by imidazole in a concentration-based manner. At the concentration of 36 μM, imidazole reduced DLD-1 and HCT-116 cell viability to 22% and 28%, respectively. Treatment with imidazole led to chromatin material condensation, detaching of cells, and apoptotic nuclei. In imidazole treated cells, the G1/G0 phase cell proportion increased, whereas in the S and G2/M phases the cell proportion decreased. Imidazole treatment of DLD-1 cells markedly promoted activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9. The level of cleaved PARP1 was also upregulated in DLD-1 cells with imidazole treatment. Treatment of DLD-1 cells with imidazole suppressed Bcl- and promoted Bax, p53, and cytc expression. The Akt activation was suppressed by imidazole treatment in DLD-1 cells. ROS generation in DLD-1 cells was enhanced markedly by treatment with imidazole. CONCLUSIONS The present study demonstrated that imidazole inhibited  cell viability through activation of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by increasing the generation of ROS, caspase activation, and apoptotic protein expression.

Preoperative identification of patients at risk for difficult TME may change the operative approach. The objective of this study was to determine if MRI pelvimetry can predict poor-quality surgery in patients undergoing laparoscopic low anterior resection (LAR) for mid- and low rectal .All patients undergoing laparoscopic LAR for rectal  ≤ 9 cm from the anal verge at a single tertiary care referral center from 2011 to 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Pelvic dimensions were measured from preoperative staging MRI on sagittal and axial views. Pelvimetry variables were all dichotomized based on median values. Exploratory factor analysis then identified the most relevant variables for regression analysis. The primary outcome was poor-quality resection, defined as an incomplete mesorectal grade, or involved circumferential (CRM) or distal (DRM) resection margins.There were 92 patients included in this study, of which 70% were male, the mean BMI was 26.0 kg/m, and the mean tumor height was 6.6 cm. Preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy was administered in 70%, and the pathologic T-stage was T3/T4 in 41%. The overall incidence of poor-quality resection was 17%, including 13% incomplete TME, 7% involved CRM, and 1% involved DRM. Factor analysis identified S1-pubic symphysis and the angle between S1 and S5-bottom of symphysis (angle ABD) as relevant variables. After adjusting for pathologic T-stage, BMI, and tumor height, a S1-S5-bottom of symphysis angle > 74.3 (OR 6.19, 95% CI 1.18-32.37) independently predicted poor-quality resection.MRI pelvimetry can identify patients at risk for a poor-quality resection after laparoscopic proctectomy for mid- and low rectal .

Remnant synchronous lesions require additional colonoscopy procedures or surgery.To investigate factors of preoperative colonoscopy potentially affecting the detection of missed lesions in patients subjected to colorectal  surgery.Of 1147 colorectal  patients subjected to curative open or laparoscopic colectomy and colonoscopy at the Chungnam National University Hospital from January 2012 to December 2016, 518 patients underwent pre- and postoperative colonoscopy. The index colonoscopy was defined as the last preoperative endoscopy performed. We analyzed pre- and postoperative medical charts for colonoscopy and pathological data. The effects of patient, procedure, and tumor factors on the postoperative adenoma detection rate, advanced adenoma detection rate, and adenoma miss rate (AMR) were analyzed.The overall AMR was 25.7% (95% confidence interval, 22.-29.8%). Comparing optimal and non-optimal bowel preparation groups, the latter had greater postoperative polyp missed rate (PMR), AMR (p < 0.01), and AAMR (p = 0.272). The optimal preparation group allowed identification of more synchronous adenomas than in the fair (OR 5.72) and poor (OR 11.39) preparation groups. On univariate analysis, patient age and left-sided colectomy (p < 0.01) influenced AMR. Multivariate analysis showed that age, preoperative bowel preparation, and left  resection influenced postoperative AMR.A better quality of index colonoscopy had a positive effect on lowering the detection rate of postoperative adenoma. Older age and suboptimal bowel preparation at the index colonoscopy and left-sided colectomy had negative effects on lowering the postoperative AMR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637303>Clinico-pathological Features of  Patients Undergoing Emergency Surgery: A Comparison Between Elderly and Non-elderly Patients.</a></h1><p>Colorectal  (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in patients older than 65 years. Emergency presentation represents about 30% of cases, with increased morbidity and mortality rates. The aim of this study is to compare the perioperative outcome between elderly and non-elderly patients undergoing emergency surgery.We retrospectively analysed CRC patients that underwent emergency surgery at the Departments of Surgery of the Sapienza University Sant'Andrea Hospital in Rome, and at San Donato Hospital in Arezzo, between June 2012 and June 2017. Patients were divided into two groups: non-elderly (< 65 years) and elderly (≥ 65 years). Variables analysed were sex, onset symptoms, associated disease, ASA score, tumor site and TNM stage, surgical procedures and approach, and morbidity and mortality.Of a total of 123 patients, 29 patients were non-elderly and 94 patients were elderly. No significant differences were observed in sex, onset symptoms and tumor site between the two groups. Comorbidities were significantly higher in elderly patients (73.4% vs 41.4%, p<0.001). No significant differences were observed between the two groups in surgical approach and the rate of one-stage procedures. Elderly patients were more frequently treated by Hartmann's procedure compared to non-elderly patients (20.% vs 6.9%). Left colorectal resection with protective ileostomy was most frequent in the non-elderly group (27.6% vs 11.7%). No significant differences were found in the pT and pN categories of the TNM system between the two groups. However, a higher number of T3 in non-elderly patients was observed. A consistent number of non-oncologically adequate resections were observed in the elderly (21.3% vs 3.5%; p<0.03). The morbidity rate was significantly higher in the elderly group (31.9 % vs 3.4%, p<0.001). No significant difference was found in the mortality rate between the two groups, being 13.8% in the elderly and 6.9% in the non-elderly.Emergency colorectal surgery for  still presents significant morbidity and mortality rates, especially in elderly patients. More aggressive tumors and advanced stages were more frequent in the non-elderly group and as a matter it should be taken into account when treating such patients in the emergency setting in order to perform a radical procedure as much as possible.© 2019 Gianluca Costa et al., published by De Gruyter.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653646>Prevention of colorectal carcinogenesis by DNA binding small molecule curaxin CBL0137 involves suppression of Wnt signaling.</a></h1><p>Chemoprevention is considered a valid approach to reduce the incidence of colorectal  (CRC), one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Here, we investigated the tumor preventive activity of curaxin CBL0137. This compound represents a new class of non-mutagenic DNA-binding small molecules that alter chromatin stability and inhibit the function of the histone chaperone FACT. Among downstream effects of CBL0137 treatment are activation of p53 and type I interferons and inhibition of NF-κB, HSF1 and MYC. In addition, our data show that in both human and mouse CRC cells in vitro CBL0137 inhibits the APC/WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, which plays a key role in  carcinogenesis. Using quantitative RT-PCR and microarray hybridization, we have demonstrated decreased expression of multiple components and downstream targets of the WNT pathway in  cells treated with CBL0137. At the same time, CBL0137 induced expression of WNT antagonists. Inhibition of WNT-signaling activity by CBL0137 was also confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. Tumor preventive activity of CBL0137 in vivo was tested in a murine model of colorectal carcinogenesis induced by 1,-dimethylhydrazine (DMH), which is known to involve WNT pathway dysregulation. After DMH subcutaneous treatment, mice were administered CBL0137 in drinking water. Efficacy of CBL0137 in suppressing CRC development in this model was evidenced by reduced incidence of adenocarcinomas and adenomas in both males and females, decrease in tumor multiplicity. These data support the prospective use of CBL0137 in chemoprevention of CRC as well as of other malignances associated with activated WNT signaling.Copyright ©2019, American Association for  Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643118>Synthesis and cytotoxic evaluation of apioarabinofuranosyl pyrimidines.</a></h1><p>In view of the potent anticancer activity of the d-arabino-configured cytosine nucleoside (ara-C), apioarabinofuranosyl pyrimidine nucleosides were designed and synthesized from d-ribose as starting material.

High ligation divides the IMA proximally at its origin, and low ligation ligates the IMA distal to the origin of left colic artery. We assessed the association of level of ligation in scheduled minimally invasive resection of sigmoid and rectal cancers on anastomotic leak, postoperative complications, and death within 30 days.We identified all patients with primary sigmoid and rectal  treated with scheduled minimally invasive resection and primary anastomosis between January 2002 and June 2018 using linked institutional and National Surgical Quality Improvement Program databases. We assessed the association of level of ligation with each outcome by fitting individual univariable and multivariable logistic regression models, adjusting for surgical approach, tumor location, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and Charlson comorbidity index.We included 158 patients treated with high ligation and 123 patients treated with low ligation. Overall, 12 patients had an anastomotic leak requiring intervention within 30 days: 5 in the high ligation group (3.%, 95% CI 1.4-7.%) and 7 in the low ligation group (5.7%, 95% CI .8-11.3%). There was no association between the level of ligation and anastomotic leak (unadjusted OR 1.85, 95% CI 0.58-6.38; adjusted OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.16-.55). Similarly, there was no association between the level of ligation and reoperation for anastomotic leak (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.15-10.9), major complications (Clavien-Dindo III-V; OR .22, 95% CI 0.90-5.77), minor complications (Clavien-Dindo I-II; OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.88-.60), and all complications (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.94-.67). No deaths occurred in either group.There was no association of level of ligation of the IMA with anastomotic leak, postoperative complications as a composite, or death.

Increased WNT2 expression is detectable in many carcinomas and participates in tumor progression. In human colorectal  (CRC), WNT2 is selectively elevated in -associated fibroblasts (CAFs), leading to increased invasion and metastasis. However, if there is a role for WNT2 in , angiogenesis was not addressed so far. We demonstrate that WNT2 enhances EC migration/invasion, while it induces canonical WNT signaling in a small subset of cells. Knockdown of WNT2 in CAFs significantly reduced angiogenesis in a physiologically relevant assay, which allows precise assessment of key angiogenic properties. In line with these results, expression of WNT2 in otherwise WNT2-devoid skin fibroblasts led to increased angiogenesis. In CRC xenografts, WNT2 overexpression resulted in enhanced vessel density and tumor volume. Moreover, WNT2 expression correlates with vessel markers in human CRC. Secretome profiling of CAFs by mass spectrometry and cytokine arrays revealed that proteins associated with pro-angiogenic functions are elevated by WNT2. These included extracellular matrix molecules, ANG-, IL-6, G-CSF, and PGF. The latter three increased angiogenesis. Thus, stromal-derived WNT2 elevates angiogenesis in CRC by shifting the balance towards pro-angiogenic signals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567189> Adenocarcinomas Harboring NTRK Fusion Genes: A Clinicopathologic and Molecular Genetic Study of 16 Cases and Review of the Literature.</a></h1><p>This study was undertaken to determine the frequency, and the clinicopathologic and genetic features, of  cancers driven by neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) gene fusions. Of the 7008 tumors screened for NTRK expression using a pan-Trk antibody, 16 (0.23%) had Trk immunoreactivity. ArcherDx assay detected TPM3-NTRK1 (n=9), LMNA-NTRK1 (n=3), TPR-NTRK1 (n=) and EML4-NTRK3 (n=1) fusion transcripts in 15 cases with sufficient RNA quality. Patients were predominantly women (median age: 63 y). The tumors involved the right (n=12) and left  unequally and were either stage T3 (n=12) or T4. Local lymph node and distant metastases were seen at presentation in 6 and 1 patients, respectively. Lymphovascular invasion was present in all cases. Histologically, tumors showed moderate to poor (n=11) differentiation with a partly or entirely solid pattern (n=5) and mucinous component (n=10), including 1 case with sheets of signet ring cells. DNA mismatch repair-deficient phenotype was seen in 13 cases. Tumor-infiltrating CD4/CD8 lymphocytes were prominent in 9 cases. Programmed death-ligand 1 positive tumor-infiltrating immune cells and focal tumor cell positivity were seen in the majority of cases. CDX2 expression and loss of CK20 and MUC2 expression were frequent. CK7 was expressed in 5 cases. No mutations in BRAF, RAS, and PIK3CA were identified. However, other genes of the PI3K-AKT/MTOR pathway were mutated. In several cases, components of Wnt/β-catenin (APC, AMER1, CTNNB1), p53, and TGFβ (ACVR2A, TGFBR2) pathways were mutated. However, no SMAD4 mutations were found. Two tumors harbored FBXW7 tumor suppressor gene mutations.

Its therapeutic use for managing  is of great interest. In the present study, we investigated the anticancer effects of adenine and the underlying mechanism in  cells.Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay. Levels of phosphorylation and protein expression were determined using western blotting. qPCR was carried out to determine the changes in mRNA expression of genes of interest.Adenine significantly inhibited the viability of  cells, HT29 and Caco- cells, in a dose-dependent manner. Adenine induced significant apoptosis in HT29 cells, whereas Caco- cells exhibited less apoptotic responses. The data showed that adenine activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling contributing to autophagic cell death through mTOR in both  cell lines.Our findings suggest that adenine inhibits the growth of  cells. Anticancer activity of adenine in  cells is attributable to the activation of apoptotic signaling and in turn the AMPK/mTOR pathway.

Previous evidence demonstrated that targeting CXCR4 improves anti-PD-1/PD-L1 efficacy reshaping TME. To evaluate the role of newly developed CXCR4 antagonists (PCT/IB2011/000120/ EP2528936B1/US2013/0079292A1) in potentiating anti-PD-1 efficacy two syngeneic murine models, the MC38  and the B16 melanoma-human CXCR4-transduced, were employed.Mice were subcutaneously injected with MC38 (1 × 10) or B16-hCXCR4 (5 × 10). After two weeks, tumors bearing mice were intraperitoneally (ip) treated with murine anti-PD-1 [RMP1-14] (5 mg/kg, twice week for  weeks), Pep R ( mg/kg, 5 days per week for  weeks), or both agents. The TME was evaluated through immunohistochemistry and flow-cytometry. In addition, the effects of the human-anti-PD-1 nivolumab and/or Peptide-R54 (Pep R54), were evaluated on human melanoma PES43 cells and xenografts treated.The combined treatment, Pep R plus anti-PD-1, reduced the MC38 Relative Tumor Volume (RTV) by .67 fold (p = 0.038) while nor anti-PD-1, neither Pep R significantly impacted on tumor growth. Significant higher number of Granzyme B (GZMB) positive cells was detected in MC38 tumors from mice treated with the combined treatment (p = 0.016) while anti-PD-1 determined a modest but significant increase of tumor-infiltrating GZMB positive cells (p = 0.035). Also, a lower number of FoxP3 positive cells was detected (p = 0.022). In the B16-hCXCR4 tumors, two weeks of combined treatment reduced tumor volume by .27 fold while nor anti-PD-1 neither Pep R significantly impacted on tumor growth. A significant higher number of GRZB positive cells was observed in B16-hCXCR4 tumors treated with combined treatment (p = 0,0015) as compared to anti-PD-1 (p = 0.028). The combined treatment reduced CXCR4, CXCL12 and PD-L1 expression in MC38 tumors. In addition, flow cytometry on fresh B16-hCXCR4 tumors showed significantly higher Tregs number following anti-PD-1 partially reversed by the combined treatment Pep R and anti-PD-1. Combined treatment determined an increase of CD8/Tregs and CD8/MDSC ratio. To dissect the effect of anti-PD-1 and CXCR4 targeting on PD-1 expressed by human  cells, PES43 human melanoma xenograft model was employed. In vitro human anti-PD-1 nivolumab or pembrolizumab (10 μM) reduced PES43 cells growth while nivolumab (10 μM) inhibited pERK1/, P38 MAPK, pAKT and p4EBP. PES43 xenograft mice were treated with Pep R54, a newly developed Pep R derivative (AcHN-Arg-Ala-[DCys-Arg- Nal(')-His-Pen]- COOH), plus nivolumab. After 3 weeks of combined treatment a significant reduction in tumor growth was shown (p = 0.038). PES43 lung disseminated tumor cells (DTC) were detected in fresh lung tissues as melanoma positive MCSP-APC cells. Although not statistically significant, DTC-PES43 cells were reduced in mice lungs treated with combined treatment while nivolumab or Pep R54 did not affect DTC number.Combined treatment with the new developed CXCR4 antagonist, Pep R, plus anti-PD-1, reduced tumor-growth in two syngeneic murine models, anti-PD-1 sensitive and resistant, potentiating Granzyme and reducing Foxp3 cells infiltration. In addition, the human specific CXCR4 antagonist, Pep R54, cooperated with nivolumab in inhibiting the growth of the PD-1 expressing human PES43 melanoma xenograft.

Cytotoxic potencies of the compounds were tested on HT-29 cells. 3-Amino-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1H-benzo[f]chromene--carbonitrile (4c) was more active among these compounds and was selected for further studies. Apoptosis was investigated by acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EtBr) double staining and flow cytometry. The qRT-PCR was used to analyze the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes. The binding attributes of 4c with calf thymus DNA (ctDNA) was examined using multi-spectroscopic measurements. We found that 4c had potent cytotoxic activity against HT-29 cells with an IC value of 60 µM through induction of cell cycle arrest in the sub-G1 phase and apoptosis. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated down-regulation of Bcl- expression, while the expression of Bax, caspase-3, -8 and -9 genes was up-regulated in HT-29 cells incubated with 4c compared with control cells. These studies revealed that 4c interacts with DNA through groove binding mode with the intrinsic binding constant (K) of 3 × 10 M. Thus, 4c is a valuable candidate for further evaluation as a new series of potent chemotherapeutic family in  treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

FTD/TPI induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) in vitro in the microsatellite stable (MSS) CT26 mouse  carcinoma cell line, as well as in various human MSS colorectal  cell lines (SW620, Caco-, and Colo-320). The combination of FTD/TPI with oxaliplatin synergized to promote ICD. In vivo, only the combination was able to induce ICD, but not the single agents, although all treatment groups showed T cell-dependency. In addition, FTD/TPI and oxaliplatin did not affect regulatory T cells (Tregs) or myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), but eliminated type- tumor-associated macrophages (TAM2), resulting in higher cytotoxic CD8+ T cells infiltration and activation. This effect was concomitantly associated with PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and PD-1 induction on CD8+ T cells, leading to secondary T-cell exhaustion. Finally, although anti-PD-1 was unable to synergize with FTD/TPI or oxaliplatin monotherapy, concomitant administration of anti-PD-1 to FTD/TPI and oxaliplatin enhanced the antitumor efficacy of the double chemotherapy. Our study showed a novel immunomodulatory role of FTD/TPI and oxaliplatin in depleting TAM2.

Here, we developed an efficient strategy for joint-domain analysis, applying it to an analysis of correlations between  epithelium methylomics and fecal microbiomics data with colorectal  risk as estimated by colorectal polyp prevalence. First, we applied domain-specific standard pipelines for quality assessment, cleaning, batch-effect removal, et cetera. Second, we performed variable homogenization for both the methylation and microbiome data sets, using domain-specific normalization and dimension reduction, obtaining scale-free variables that could be compared across the two domains. Finally, we implemented a joint-domain network analysis to identify relevant microbial-methylation island patterns. The network analysis considered all possible species-island pairs, thus being quadratic in its complexity. However, we were able to pre-select the unpaired variables by performing a preliminary association analysis on the outcome polyp prevalence. All results from association and interaction analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Although the limited sample size did not provide good power (80% to detect medium to large effect sizes with 5% alpha error), a number of potentially significant association (dozens in the uncorrected analysis, reducing to just a few in the corrected one) were identified As a last step, we linked the network patterns identified by our approach to the KEGG functional ontology, showing that the method can generate new mechanistic hypotheses for the biological causes of polyp development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658051>Erythrocyte deformability and aggregability in patients undergoing  surgery and effects of two infusions with omega-3 fatty acids.</a></h1><p>An adequate erythrocyte function is vital for tissue oxygenation and wound healing.

The estimated 3-year RFI was 30% when ctDNA was detectable after chemotherapy and 77% when ctDNA was undetectable (HR, 6.8; 95% CI, 11.0-157.0; P < .001). Postsurgical ctDNA status remained independently associated with RFI after adjusting for known clinicopathologic risk factors (HR, 7.5; 95% CI, 3.5-16.1; P < .001).Results suggest that ctDNA analysis after surgery is a promising prognostic marker in stage III . Postchemotherapy ctDNA analysis may define a patient subset that remains at high risk of recurrence despite completing standard adjuvant treatment. This high-risk population presents a unique opportunity to explore additional therapeutic approaches.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572588>Antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of grape pomace and grape seed extracts on colorectal  cell lines.</a></h1><p>Grape pomace is the source of bioactive compounds (anthocyanins, flavonols, flavan-3-ols, and stilbenes) which exhibit antiproliferative actions on cell cultures. We have investigated the antitumoral effects of grape pomace and grape seed extracts on  cells (Caco-, HT-29) and fibroblasts. Crude extracts prepared from white and red pomace, and grape seeds, reduced the viability and proliferation of Caco-. HT-29 cells were resistant to these actions. Purified extracts were then prepared from the same sources and compared with the LDH test; again, all three extracts were active and purified extract from grape seed was the most potent and specific on Caco- cells. HT-29 cells were more sensitive to these purified extracts. The biological activity resided almost exclusively in the flavonol and flavan-3-ols subfractions, rather than the anthocyanin subfraction. Preliminary results on the mechanisms involved in these effects revealed downregulation of Myc gene expression in HT-29 and upregulation of Ptg2 in Caco- cells.© 2019 The Authors.

In contrast, cytotoxicity of GGA has also been reported. Some studies have reported that GGA suppresses cell growth and induces apoptosis in cell models of human leukemia, ovarian carcinoma, and  . Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether GGA can have a cytotoxic effect on a human cervical  cell line (HeLa), human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-), and human embryonic kidney cells 293 (HEK) in normal-glucose and high-glucose environments (NG and HG, respectively). The results showed that 100 μM GGA inhibited proliferation of HeLa cells only in NG environment despite inhibiting proliferation of Caco- and HEK cells regardless of glucose concentration. Cell viability assay revealed that GGA decreased viability of HeLa, Caco-, and HEK cells only in NG environment. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that the type of cell death was a combination of necrosis and apoptosis. Our study revealed that difference in cytotoxicity of GGA is influenced by glucose condition. The cytotoxic effects of GGA are attenuated in the HG condition. Since both cytotoxic and cytoprotective effects are reported about GGA, further research is needed about the mechanism of the cytotoxic effects.© Yuko Nakano et al. 2019; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572011>Clinical features, treatment and outcomes of colorectal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma: literature reviews published in English between 1993 and 2017.</a></h1><p>Colorectal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (cMALToma) is rare and comprises only .5% of the MALT lymphomas. Its etiology and treatment have not been well established. The aim of this systematic literature review was to try to characterize cMALToma and analyze the risk factors for treatment failure with various therapeutic strategies.We retrospectively reviewed 50 case reports from 1993 to 2017 through a PubMed search of English medical literature, describing cMALToma. We included 67 patients from previous case reports and we added 6 patients treated for cMALToma in our multicenter institutes. Risk factor analysis was done for treatment failure, defined as remission failure and recurrence.Of 73 patients diagnosed with cMALToma, tumors were located in 54 patients (74.0%) in the rectum, in 10 patients (13.6%) in the right , in 3 patients (4.1%) in the transverse , and in 6 patients (8.%) in the sigmoid . In first-line treatment, patients achieved complete remission (CR) with surgery (18/19 cases), local resection (18/19 cases), chemotherapy (12/13 cases), radiation therapy (4/5 cases), antibiotics therapy including  eradication (12/15 cases), and no treatment (1/ cases). Among these, eight cases (10.9%) needed second-line treatment, and there was overall remission failure in 3 cases (4.1%). Of the remaining 70 patients with CR, the tumor recurred in 5 patients (6.8%). The multivariable analysis showed that male sex, multiple tumors, and first-line treatment failure were significantly related to treatment failure (=0.03, =0.05, =0.03, respectively).CR of primary cMALToma was achieved using various therapeutic strategies. First-line treatment failure and multiple tumors were associated with treatment failure, although the numbers of cases that failed are too small to draw definitive conclusions.© 2019 Won et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597260>Bio-Mediated Synthesis and Characterisation of Silver Nanocarrier, and Its Potent Anticancer Action.</a></h1><p>Discovery of a potent drug nanocarrier is crucial for  therapy in which drugs often face challenges in penetrating efficiently into solid tumours. Here, biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using a waste material,  (GM) fruit peel extract is demonstrated. The best condition for AgNPs synthesis was with 0.5 g of peel extract, 7.5 mM silver nitrate at 45 °C, ~pH 4 for 16 h. The synthesized AgNPs were spherical and 32.7 ± 5.7 nm in size. To test its efficiency to be used as drug carrier, plant-based drug, protocatechuic acid (PCA) was used as a test drug. AgNPs loaded with PCA (AgPCA) resulted in 80% of inhibition at 15.6 µg/mL as compared to AgNPs which only killed 5% of HCT116 colorectal cells at same concentration. The IC of AgNPs and AgPCA for HCT116 were 40. and 10.7 µg/mL, respectively. At 15.6 µg/mL, AgPCA was not toxic to the tested  normal cells, CCD112. Ag-based drug carrier could also potentially reduce the toxicity of loaded drug as the IC of PCA alone (148.1 µg/mL) was higher than IC of AgPCA (10.7 µg/mL) against HCT116. Further, 24-h treatment of 15.6 µg/mL AgPCA resulted in loss of membrane potential in the mitochondria of HCT116 cells and increased level of reaction oxygen species (ROS). These could be the cellular killing mechanisms of AgPCA. Collectively, our findings show the synergistic anticancer activity of AgNPs and PCA, and its potential to be used as a potent anticancer drug nanocarrier.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644719>Splenic flexure mobilization in sigmoid and rectal  resections: a meta-analysis of surgical outcomes.</a></h1><p>to evaluate the influence of the splenic flexure mobilization for the main surgical outcomes of patients submitted to resection of sigmoid and rectal .we searched the MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and LILACS, using the terms "splenic flexure mobilization", "colorectal surgery", "rectal ", "anterior resection", "sigmoid ", and "sigmoid resection".

We immunohistochemically analyzed the expression of the transcription factors (TWIST-1, SLUG, ZEB1, ZEB2) and components of the extracellular matrix (laminin-5, fibronectin) which influence the EMT.Primary human breast (MDA-MB-231),  (HT29, HCT116), ovarian (SKOV3, OVCAR3) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (UTSCC2, UTSCC24A) grown as xenografts were immunohistochemically analyzed in vitro and in vivo.A high SLUG expression was observed in every  entity both in vitro and in vivo. ZEB1 and ZEB2 showed a high in vivo expression especially in SKOV3 and in in vitro grown MDA-MB-231 cells.SLUG expression showed the highest expression in all  entities investigated.

The reaction starts from the coupling between -tosylhydrazones and -chloro-3-nitroimidazo[1,-]pyridines leading to the formation of 3-nitro--(arylvinyl)imidazo[1,-]pyridine derivatives. Optimization of Cadogan-reductive conditions allowed the conversion of the obtained nitro derivative to a new scaffold of the type 3-aryl-1-pyrrolo-imidazo[1,-]pyridine. This method provides rapid access to new libraries in the context of diversity-oriented synthesis, which intends to generate small molecules with a large structure diversity in an efficient manner.

Thirty-two male Wistar albino rats were allocated into four groups: Control, AOM, AOM + JB, and JB groups. Whereas the control group was fed with standard pellet feed, the AOM and AOM + JB groups were administered of AOM (15 mg/kg body weight) subcutaneously once every  weeks for 10 weeks. AOM + JB and JB groups additionally received JB oil (100 µl/kg) orally. At the end of the 16-week experimental period, blood and tissue samples were obtained from the rats following necropsy. The macroscopic findings showed that the application of JB oil significantly decreased adenoma and adenocarcinoma formation both numerically and dimensionally. Immunohistochemically, CEA, COX-, and Ki-67 immune-expressions decreased, and the immune-expression of caspase-3 increased in AOM + JB treated rats. Additionally, JB oil supplementation ameliorated antioxidant defense systems and lipid peroxidation within the  tissue of AOM + JB treated rats. These results reveal that the JB oil acted as a chemopreventive dietary agent, inhibiting cell proliferation and COX- expression and inducing apoptosis, resulting in a significant reduction in  tumor formation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618463>Inhibitory Effects of Pectinase-Treated Prunus Mume Fruit Concentrate on Colorectal  Proliferation and Angiogenesis of Endothelial Cells.</a></h1><p>Pectinase is a well-known enzyme used in the food processing industry to produce fruit juice and concentrate. This study evaluated the anticancer and antiangiogenesis activities of pectinase-treated Prunus mume fruit concentrate (PC) and its phenolic components. PC treatment (250 to 1,000 µg/mL) resulted in decreased proliferation of SW480 human colorectal  cells through S-phase cell cycle arrest; however, equivalent concentrations of PC did not show toxicity toward CRL-1539  normal cells. Furthermore, PC-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in SW480 cells, which was characterized by accumulation of apoptotic cell population, cell shrinkage, formation of apoptotic bodies, upregulation of proapoptotic Bax, cleaved PARP, caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9, and downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-. Antiangiogenesis effects of PC were assessed using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that PC did not inhibit HUVECs proliferation at concentrations of 500 to 1,500 µg/mL. In addition, treatment with PC at nontoxic concentrations (500 to 1,000 µg/mL) blocked vascular endothelial growth factor induced cell migration, invasion, capillary-like tube formation, and angiogenesis from rat aortic rings. HPLC-PDA analysis showed that there were at least four different phenolics including 5-HMF, neochlorogenic acid, protocatechuic acid, and syringic acid. Taken together, these results indicated that PC could be used as a good source of phenolic compounds with selective anticancer and antiangiogenesis activities. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Pectinases are one of the well-known enzyme used in the part of food processing. Treatment of pectinase is a useful strategy to reduce viscosity, turbidity, and pulp particles in the production of fruit juice, extract, and concentrate. In the present study, we found that pectinase-treated P. mume fruit concentrate significantly suppresses colorectal  proliferation and angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The significance of our findings is that pectinase-treated P. mume concentrate may be used as a commercial functional food material to inhibit colorectal  and angiogenesis.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672651>High Clusterin (CLU) mRNA expression levels in tumors of colorectal  patients predict a poor prognostic outcome.</a></h1><p>Clusterin (CLU) is a multifunctional intra-/extra-cellular molecular chaperone with indications of serving as a promising prognostic biomarker for colorectal  (CRC). Several studies have examined the potential prognostic value of the CLU protein in CRC; however, our research follows an alternative approach, focusing on the CLU mRNA expression.Total RNA from 172 cancerous tissue specimens and 39 paired non-cancerous ones was isolated and  μg of this were subjected to reverse transcription with an oligo-dT primer. The single stranded DNA, which was synthesized, was amplified with an in-house developed highly sensitive and precise qPCR method, using specific pair of primers for the CLU molecule. Finally, an extensive biostatical analysis took place for the assessment of the results.Patients with tumors expressing high CLU mRNA levels had a higher probability for poor outcome (relapse and death), comparing to those with CLU mRNA-negative tumors. This association between CLU mRNA expression status and both disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) is evident in Cox regression analysis and is also depicted in the Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Consistently, the aforementioned associations and the CLU mRNA expression levels are significantly enhanced as CRC tumors progress from TNM stage I to IV, further supporting the functional implication of CLU in tumorigenesis.High CLU mRNA levels in CRC tumors can act as a new adverse prognostic biomarker of DFS and OS for CRC, independent of clinicopathological and biological features of the patient.Copyright © 2019.

Twenty-four Wistar rats were divided into Control, Exercise, 1,-Dimethylhydrazine (DMH) and DMH + Exercise. After a week, rats in DMH group were given DMH twice a week for two weeks. Animals in exercise groups performed exercise on a treadmill 5 days/week for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks of training, levels of COX-, PCNA, Bax, Bcl- and procaspase-3/cleaved caspase-3 were assessed. Histological changes, number of aberrant crypt foci (ACF), serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were also analyzed. ACF number was significantly decreased following exercise program. Protein levels of COX-, PCNA and serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly elevated in the rats receiving DMH and downregulated after performing exercise program (P<0.05). Exercise upregulated apoptosis, which was evident from the increased Bax/Bcl2 ratio and enhanced the expression levels of activated caspase-3, as compared to DMH group. The  architecture was improved in DMH + Exercise. Exercise can effectively attenuate DMH-induced increase of inflammatory markers.

Advanced neoplasia (AN) represents the main target of colorectal  screening programs. Our aim was to assess CCE- diagnostic accuracy for the detection of AN in FIT+ screenees.Subjects aged 50 to 69, with a positive FIT in 4 population screening programs in Italy and Spain were enrolled. Screenees were asked to perform CCE-, followed by traditional colonoscopy (TC). TC was performed the same day or the following morning. Bowel preparation included a split PEG-based regimen and sodium phosphate (NaP) with gastografin as boosters. CCE- video was read by an endoscopist blinded to the results of TC. The main outcomes were CCE- accuracy in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for AN when using  different-sized thresholds for TC referral (ie, >6 or >10 mm polyp).Two hundred twenty-two subjects were enrolled, and 178 patients completed both CCE- and TC examination (87.7%). Overall, 59 cases of AN were detected at TC. Overall, CCE- sensitivity was 90%, specificity was 66.1%, PPV was 57.4%, and NPV was 92.9% for AN when using a 6 mm cut-off (TC referral rate: 52.8%) and 76.7%, 90.7%, 80.7%, 88.4% when using 10 mm cut-off (TC referral rate: 32%), respectively. CCE- detected that 8 out of 9 already developed CRC. Among the 41 false-positives at 6-mm cut-off, 34 (82.9%) presented with a nonadvanced adenoma at TC. Mean transit time was 4:04 hours and >70% of patients excreted CCE within 5 hours.In an enriched-disease setting, we showed the high sensitivity of CCE- for advanced neoplasia at 6 mm cut-off. The apparently low CCE- specificity is related to the choice of AN as the main outcome.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The objectives were to assess the incidence of synchronous and metachronous PC, explore potential risk factors for developing PC as the only site of metastasis, and identify which patients might be candidates for prophylactic hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).We conducted a retrospective analysis of 125 patients with pT4  who underwent surgery in a single center between January 2010 and December 2014.Of the 947  patients who underwent surgery, 125 (13.%) were diagnosed with pT4a or b  carcinoma. The median follow-up was 3.7 years. The overall rate of PC was 34.3%, being synchronous in 12% and metachronous in 22.3% of cases. The 8% and 6% of synchronous and metachronous cases of PC respectively were isolated (single site) metastasis. The incidence of PC was 6.1% at 1 year and 14.5% at 3 years after surgery. pT4 was not found to be an independent risk factor for the development of PC (p = 0.231). Nonetheless, the rate of metachronous PC as a single site of metastasis was higher in patients with pT4 tumors and peritoneal nodules around the primary tumor and/or tumor perforation (p = 0.027) and/or who underwent emergency surgery (p = 0.043) than other patients.Considering pT4 tumor stage as the only risk factor for the development of PC in deciding whether to administer prophylactic HIPEC would lead to unjustified overtreatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597098>Disrupting Myelin-Specific Th17 Cell Gut Homing Confers Protection in an Adoptive Transfer Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis.</a></h1><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common autoimmune disease of the CNS. Although an association between MS and inflammatory bowel diseases is observed, the link connecting intestinal immune responses and neuroinflammation remains unclear. Here we show that encephalitogenic Th17 cells infiltrate the  lamina propria before neurological symptom development in two murine MS models, active and adoptive transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Specifically targeting Th17 cell intestinal homing by blocking the α4β7-integrin and its ligand MAdCAM-1 pathway impairs T cell migration to the large intestine and dampens EAE severity in the Th17 cell adoptive transfer model. Mechanistically, myelin-specific Th17 cells proliferate in the  and affect gut microbiota composition. The beneficial effect of blocking the α4β7-integrin and its ligand MAdCAM-1 pathway on EAE is interdependent with gut microbiota. Those results show that disrupting myelin-specific Th17 cell trafficking to the large intestine harnesses neuroinflammation and suggests that the gut environment and microbiota catalyze the encephalitogenic properties of Th17 cells.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Expressions of miR-29b and folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) were measured in both human  tumor samples and cell lines.  cell lines SW480 and SW620 were transfected with miR-29b mimic, antisense oligonucleotides (ASO)-miR-29b, small interfering (siRNA) against FOLR1 (si-FOLR1), or corresponding negative controls (NCs), and then were incubated with or without oxaliplatin (L-OHP). Thereafter, cell viability, cytotoxicity, cell apoptosis, and expression of FOLR1, ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily G Member  (ABCG2) and p-glycoprotein (p-gp) were analyzed. We found that miR-29b was significantly decreased, while FOLR1 was statistically elevated in  samples and cell lines compared to the nontumor samples and nontumourigenic immortalized human  epithelial cell line FHC. Overexpression of miR-29b markedly inhibited cell viability, promoted sensitivity to L-OHP, stimulated cell apoptosis (all p < .05), and decreased the levels of ABCG2 and p-gp in  cells, whereas suppression of miR-29b showed contrary results. Moreover, we observed that FOLR1 was a direct target of miR-29b and was negatively regulated by miR-29b. In addition, the findings revealed that the effects of FOLR1 inhibition on cell viability, sensitivity to L-OHP, cell apoptosis, and the levels of ABCG2 and p-gp were similar to overexpression of miR-29b. Taken together, our study suggests that miR-29b inhibits cell growth and promotes sensitivity to L-OHP in  by targeting FOLR1.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674147>Synthesis of CA4 carboxamides mimicking with sulfonyl piperazines by a molecular hybridization approach: In vitro cytotoxicity evaluation and tubulin polymerization inhibition.</a></h1><p>Molecular hybridization approach is a promising structural modification tool to design new chemical entities (NCEs) by mimicking two different pharmacophoric units into one scaffold to enhance the biological properties.

EGFR overexpression may be detected in up to 90% of pancreatic tumors. However, drug resistance of EGFR inhibitors targeting treatment severely limits its clinical application.In this study, Western blotting was used to detect the expression of p-Stat3, EGFR, Bcl-, cleaved-caspase3 and Bax. Cell apoptosis was evaluated via flow cytometry. The  assay and MTT assay were applied for detecting the cell proliferation in vitro. The xenograft mouse model was used to examine the cell proliferation in vivo.Emodin remarkably enhanced the anti- effect of EGFR inhibitor on pancreatic  cells. In addition, emodin promoted afatinib-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the Stat3 signaling pathway. Meanwhile, siRNAs against Stat3 significantly increased the apoptosis of pancreatic  cells. EGFR inhibitor promoted phosphorylation of Stat3 in pancreatic  cells. Interestingly, emodin combined with EGFR inhibitor inhibited the proliferation of pancreatic  cells in vitro. The tumor xenograft mice model was further confirmed that emodin possessed a synergy anticancer effect with afatinib on pancreatic  cells by regulating the Stat3 expression.These results indicate that the combination of emodin with EGFR inhibitor is an effective therapeutic strategy to sensitize human pancreatic .© 2019 Wang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678743>Anticancer and antimicrobial effects of novel ciprofloxacin fatty acids conjugates.</a></h1><p>Ciprofloxacin (CP) has a confirmed cytotoxic action on some cancerous cells, but in high, non-pharmacological concentrations. Considering features of natural fatty acids, such as biocompatibility, biodegradability and their increased cellular uptake by  cells, it seems that combining them with a drug could improve its bioavailability, and thus cytotoxicity. Therefore, the aim of this study was coupling of CP with saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, and evaluation of their cytotoxicity, apoptosis-inducing effects and inhibition of IL-6 release in human primary (SW480) and metastatic (SW620) , metastatic prostate  (PC3) and normal (HaCaT) cell lines. The PC3 cell line was the most sensitive to the presence of the obtained conjugates. The value of IC for oleic acid conjugate (4) was 7.7 μM, and it was 12 times lower than for CP alone (101.4 μM). The studied derivatives induced late apoptosis in all  cell lines, but not in normal cells. The most potent apoptosis inducer was conjugate 4, that resulted in the highest percentage of PC3 cells in late apoptosis (81.5% ± 3.9), followed by elaidic acid amide 5 (75% ± 4.8). The strongest pro-apoptic effects on SW480 cells were demonstrated by conjugates of DHA (8) and sorbic () acids, whereas in SW620 cell lines, compounds  and 5 appeared to be the most effective. To establish the mechanism of cytotoxic action of derivatives , 4, 5, the level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) was measured. The compounds with the highest cytotoxic potential significantly decreased the release of IL-6 by  cells. Additionally, all conjugates were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity. Short chain amides - crotonic (1) and sorbic () - were the most active against Staphyloccoci. The second-mentioned amide has shown both strong antistaphylococcal and antitumor properties.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

A non-invasive imaging agent with rapid clearance rate would be an ideal tool to predict and monitor the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy. The aim of this research was to engineer a subnanomolar, high-affinity fibronectin type 3 domain (FN3)-based small binder targeted against human PD-L1 (hPD-L1) present on tumor cells. A naive yeast G4 library containing the FN3 gene with three binding loop sequences was used to isolate high-affinity binders targeted to purified full-length hPD-L1. The selected binder clones displayed several mutations in the loop regions of the FN3 domain. One unique clone (FN3hPD-L1-01) with a 6x His-tag at the C-terminus had a protein yield of >5 mg/L and a protein mass of 12 kDa. In vitro binding assays on six different human  cell lines (MDA-MB-231, DLD1, U87, 293 T, Raji and Jurkat) and murine CT26  carcinoma cells stably expressing hPD-L1 showed that CT26/hPD-L1 cells had the highest expression of hPD-L1 in both basal and IFN-γ-induced states, with a binding affinity of .38 ± 0.26 nM for FN3hPD-L1-01. The binding ability of FN3hPD-L1-01 was further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining on ex vivo CT26/hPD-L1 tumors sections. The FN3hPD-L1-01 binder represents a novel, small, high-affinity binder for imaging hPD-L1 expression on tumor cells and would aid in earlier imaging of tumors. Future clinical validation studies of the labeled FN3hPD-L1 binder(s) have the potential to monitor immune checkpoint inhibitors therapy and predict responders.© The Author(s) 2019.

Therefore, we analyzed the prognostic impact of KRAS and BRAF mutations in patients with peritoneal metastases scheduled for CRS and HIPEC.In a consecutive series of 399 patients scheduled for CRS and HIPEC between 2009 and 2017, 111 subjects with peritoneal metastases from primaries of the appendix, , or rectum were analyzed for KRAS mutation and 92 for BRAF mutation.Mutation in KRAS was present in 51/111 (46%), and mutated BRAF was found in 10/92 (11%). There was no difference in overall survival between KRAS mutation tumors and KRAS wild type, whereas BRAF mutation was associated with short survival. No subject with BRAF mutation survived  years. On multivariate analysis, completeness of cytoreduction score (CCS, p = 0.000001), presence of signet cell differentiation (p = 0.000001), and BRAF mutation (p = 0.0021) were linked with poor prognosis.BRAF mutation is a marker of poor prognosis in patients with appendiceal and colorectal peritoneal metastases scheduled for CRS and HIPEC, whereas survival outcome in subjects with mutated KRAS does not differ from wild-type KRAS.

A redox imaging marker would help identify cancers susceptible to redox-directed therapies. Copper(II)-diacetyl-bis(4-methylthiosemicarbazonato) (Cu-ATSM) is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer developed for hypoxia imaging that could potentially be used for this purpose. We aimed to demonstrate that Cu-ATSM signal is dependent upon cellular redox state, irrespective of hypoxia.  We investigated the relationship between Cu-ATSM signal and redox state in human cervical and  cells. We altered redox state using drug strategies and single gene mutations in IDH1/. Concentrations of reducing molecules were determined by spectrophotometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and compared with Cu-ATSM signal  Mouse models of cervical  were used to evaluate the relationship between Cu-ATSM signal and levels of reducing molecules , and change in Cu-ATSM signal after redox-active drug treatment.  A correlation exists between baseline Cu-ATSM signal and cellular concentration of glutathione, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Altering NADH and NADPH metabolism using drug strategies and IDH1 mutations resulted in significant changes in Cu-ATSM signal under normoxic conditions. Hypoxia likewise changed Cu-ATSM, but treatment of hypoxic cells with redox active drugs resulted in a more dramatic change than hypoxia alone. A significant difference in NADPH was seen between cervical tumor orthotopic implants  without a corresponding difference in Cu-ATSM signal. There was a change in Cu-ATSM signal in xenograft tumors <50mg after treatment with β-lapachone, but not in larger tumors.  Cu-ATSM signal reflects redox state, and altering redox state impacts Cu-ATSM metabolism.

The aim of this study was to evaluate variability in diagnosing pT4a . Twelve pathologists classified 66 preselected scanned Hematoxylin/Eosin-stained slides with tumor cells at a distance of 25-1500 μm (n = 22), 0-25 μm (n = 22), or on (n = 22) the peritoneal surface. Inter- and intraobserver variability were calculated using Kappa statistics. For interlaboratory variability, pathology reports of pT3 and pT4a  were extracted from the Dutch Pathology Registry between 2012 and 2015. The proportion of pT4a (pT4a/(pT3+pT4a)) was compared between 33 laboratories. Potential risk of understaging was assessed by determining the average number of blocks taken from pT3 and pT4a N0-2M0 tumors with metachronous peritoneal metastasis. Interobserver variability among 12 pathologists was 0.50 (95%CI 0.41-0.60; moderate agreement). Intraobserver variability (8 pathologists) was 0.71 (substantial agreement). A total of 7745 reports with pT3 or pT4aN0-2M0  from 33 laboratories were included for interlaboratory analysis. Median percentage of pT4a was 15.5% (range 3.-24.6%). After adjustment for case mix, 8 labs diagnosed pT4a significantly less or more frequently than the median lab.

Its longstanding use in China to treat gastrointestinal tract and rheumatologic disorders is generally regarded as safe, supporting initial investigations in an at-risk population, such as individuals with ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the safety of berberine in this population is not established. Individuals living in China with biopsy-proven UC, ≤ grade  dysplasia, and with a UC disease activity index (UCDAI) score ≤ 1 on mesalamine, were randomized 3:1 in a double-blind phase I trial to berberine 900 mg/day or placebo for 3 months, with the primary objective of assessing safety. Blood samples and biopsies of the colorectum, from prespecified locations, were collected prior to and following therapy. Secondary endpoints included changes in UCDAI score, and in tissue and plasma markers of inflammation. Of toxicities at least possibly related, one episode of grade 3 elevation in transaminases and one episode of grade 1 nausea were observed among 12 individuals on berberine, and none were observed among 4 on placebo. The mean plasma berberine concentration was 3.5 nM after berberine treatment, significantly higher than 0.5 nM with placebo. Berberine significantly decreased the Geboes grade in  tissue, but had a nonsignificant effect on other tissue or blood biomarkers related to cell growth and inflammation. The combination of berberine and mesalamine is well tolerated in Chinese with UC, and may enhance mesalamine's anti-inflammatory effects in  tissue.Copyright ©2019, American Association for  Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583329>A Trial Protocol of Biweekly TAS-102 and Bevacizumab as Third-Line Chemotherapy for Advanced/Recurrent Colorectal : A Phase II Multicenter Clinical Trial (The TAS-CC4 Study).</a></h1><p>Treatment with TAS-102 has significantly improved the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with metastatic colorectal  (mCRC). Reportedly, the combination of TAS-102 plus bevacizumab extends the median PFS. The present study aimed to confirm the efficacy and safety of TAS-102 plus bevacizumab (biweekly administration) as third-line chemotherapy for patients with mCRC.This is a single-arm, open-label, prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter phase II trial conducted in Japan. With a threshold and expected PFS of .1 and 3.5 months, respectively, the simulation results showed a sample size of 42 with α = 0.05 (both sides) for 90% power, based on the One-Arm Binomial test using the SWOG statistical tool. If the estimated dropout is 7%-8%, the target sample size is estimated to be 45. The TAS-CC4 study regimen comprised 28-day cycles with biweekly oral administration of TAS-102 (35 mg/m twice daily on days 1-5 and 15-19 of every 28-day cycle) and bevacizumab (5.0 mg/kg on days 1 and 15). The primary end point is the PFS; secondary end points include response rate (RR), OS, grade ≥3 neutropenia, and genetic alterations (KRAS/BRAF mutations) in the circulating cell-free DNA.The present study can contribute to the determination of the effective dosing interval of TAS-102 and bevacizumab in patients with mCRC and is thought to lead to prophylaxis of neutropenia and prolongation of the treatment period.Copyright © 2019 by The Japan Society of Coloproctology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651566>Supplementation with phytoestrogens and insoluble fibers reduces intestinal carcinogenesis and restores ER-β expression in Apc-driven colorectal carcinogenesis.</a></h1><p>Supplementation with phytoestrogens and insoluble fibers has been reported to reduce duodenal polyps in colectomized familial adenomatous polyposis patients, with a mechanism involving, at least in part, upregulation of estrogen receptor-β subtype, whose expression is lowered during intestinal tumorigenesis. These data suggest a protective effect also in the , the main target organ for tumorigenesis in familial adenomatous polyposis and a major  type in non-familial (sporadic) cancers. Therefore, we tested whether a similar preparation might reduce tumorigenesis in the  of Pirc rats (F344/NTac-Apc) mutated in the Apc gene and thus, like familial adenomatous polyposis patients, spontaneously developing multiple tumors in the . We first demonstrate that estrogen receptor-β expression in Pirc rat  is significantly down-regulated compared to age-matched wt rats. Then, Pirc rats aged 1 month were treated for 3 months with Adipol (Adi), a patented preparation containing phytoestrogens and insoluble fibers.  tumorigenesis was significantly reduced by Adi treatment ( tumors/rat were 5.3 ± 0.8 and .9 ± 0.3, Mucin Depleted Foci/rat 127 ± 6.6 and 97.1 ± 8.6 in Controls and Adi-treated rats, respectively, means ± SE, P < 0.01). The treatment also normalized  proliferation pattern along the crypt and significantly increased apoptosis in  tumors. Estrogen receptor-β expression was increased by Adi treatment, especially in the tumors. These positive effects suggest that Adipol may be exploited as a chemopreventive agent to reduce  risk in familial adenomatous polyposis patients and to postpone prophylactic colectomy. Moreover, given the similarities between familial adenomatous polyposis and sporadic colorectal , it might also be used as chemopreventive agent in colorectal  patients at risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559357>Anorectal  surveillance in Crohn's disease.</a></h1><p>One of the characteristics of colorectal  complicating Crohn's disease (CD) in the Japanese population is that it frequently occurs in the lower anorectal site.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of an electronic health record (EHR) clinical decision support alert to decrease guideline-nonadherent cervical  screening beyond the age limits of screening or posthysterectomy.The proportion of guideline-nonadherent Pap tests in women younger than 21 years or older than 65 years or posthysterectomy were compared 4 months before and 3 months after implementation of an EHR clinical decision support alert warning providers that a Pap test is not indicated. Providers could cancel the Pap test or override the alert and place the order. Provider characteristics and Pap test indications were summarized by preintervention/postintervention period using descriptive statistics. The proportions of nonindicated Pap tests were compared by intervention period and provider characteristics using generalized estimating equation models.In women beyond the screening age limits or posthysterectomy, a total of 388 Pap tests were ordered before intervention, and 313 tests were ordered after intervention. Proportion of guideline-nonadherent tests was similar before (62%) and after intervention (63%); thus, implementation of the clinical decision support alert did not change the proportion of guideline-nonadherent Pap tests ordered (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.77-1.52). It is notable that 52% of guideline-nonadherent tests were ordered by 11 providers. Even when controlling for providers who ordered more than 1 test during the study period, multivariate analysis showed that male providers were more likely to order guideline-nonadherent Pap tests (OR = .30, 95% CI = 1.36-3.89); no other differences by provider characteristics were observed.An EHR clinical decision support alert does not decrease guideline-nonadherent cervical  screening.

The aim of this study has been to retrospectively evaluate the oncologic long-term results of our cases comparing our data with other authors' experiences.Clinical data of patients with SFC operated on at our institute were retrospectively analyzed. The laparoscopic approach was used in the whole series, with limited resection distally and proximally to splenic flexure and the origin ligation of left colic artery and left branch of middle colic artery. Data on the oncological long-term safety were compared to our laparoscopic series of extended right colectomy for proximal two-third transverse  and high anterior resections for sigmoid-high rectal  and to the main evidences in the literature, found after a comprehensive review.From March 2008 to May 2018, we completed 53 laparoscopic splenic flexure resections (26 female and 27 male, age 71.5 ± 15.4 years). The conversion rate was 3.8%. Most of the cases were stage II (pT3 73.5%, the mean number of lymph nodes harvested was 19.1, with positivity for malignancy in 45.3%). During the FU (43.5 months),  patients dropped out. Out of the 51 residual cases, 37 were alive (72.5%) and 14 are deceased (27.5%).Compared to the literature, our survival rate does not show significant differences.

It has been reported that response gene to complement 32 (RGC-32) promotes M2 macrophage polarization. However, whether RGC-32 expression in macrophages could play a potential role in tumor progression remain unclear. Here we identified that increasing RGC-32 expression in  and tumor associated macrophages was positively correlated with  progression. In vitro studies confirmed that  cells upregulated RGC-32 expression of macrophages via secreting TGF-β1. RGC-32 expression promoted macrophage migration. In addition, stimulation of HCT-116 cells with the condition mediums of RGC-32-silienced or over-expressed macrophages affected tumor cell colony formation and migration via altered COX- expression. In an animal model, macrophages with RGC-32 knockdown significantly decreased the expression of COX- and Ki67 in the xenografts, and partly inhibited tumor growth. Together, our results provide the evidences for a critical role of TGF-β1/RGC-32 pathway in TAMs and  cells during tumor progression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678242>Development of organoid-based drug metabolism model.</a></h1><p>Cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene superfamily catalyzes oxidative metabolism of a wide variety of drugs, carcinogens, and endogenous biomolecules in the liver and intestinal organs. In vitro assay platforms such as primary hepatocyte and immortalized liver-derived cell lines have been developed to evaluate drug effects. However, several limitations have been suggested regarding discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo assays. In this study, we aimed to investigate drug metabolism and toxicity based on mouse small intestinal and liver organoids derived from resident stem cells. At first, expressions and activities of CYP subfamilies (CYPs) in intestinal and liver organoids were investigated. Organoids treated with three CYPs-inducers dexamethasone (Dex), β-naphthoflavone (BNF), and 1,4-bis--(3, 5-dichloropyridyloxy)-benzene (TCPOBOP) were evaluated for CYPs activities. The CYPs-induced intestinal and liver organoids were confirmed to digest more docetaxel, as  cell-line survived more in CYPs-induced organoid's medium than in non-induced organoid's medium. Then, the activity of docetaxel in a co-culture platform of mouse liver organoids and human pancreatic tumoroids was measured. We obtained significant statistical values on CYPs-induced metabolic activities: cell survival rates of pancreatic tumoroids co-cultured with docetaxel-treated undifferentiated, differentiated, and CYPs-induced differentiated organoids were 66.05 ± .14%, 89.20 ± .67%, and 101.90 ± 0.94%, respectively. To sum up, gene expression modification and drug metabolism evaluation were able to be done with organoids as done with tissues. In vivo-like in vitro investigation on drug toxicity may potentially be done with organoids as a stepping bridge to the clinical trial.Copyright © 2018.

Although the clinical and genetic characteristics of LS in Western countries have been well characterized, the information of Japanese LS is limited. As a collaborative study of Japanese Society for  of the  and Rectum (JSCCR), we registered colorectal  (CRC) patients who fulfilled the modified Amsterdam II criteria including gastric  as an LS-related tumor. Among 4030 CRC patients initially registered in this project, 85 patients (.1%) fulfilled the modified criteria. An additional 26 patients who met the same criteria were enrolled in the analysis. We analyzed three major responsible genes, MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 by direct sequencing, and further performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for MLH1 and MSH2. Consequently, we identified pathogenic variants in 64 of the 111 patients comprising of 34 patients in MLH1, 28 in MSH2, and  in MSH6. It is of note that large structural alterations were found in 17 patients. Among the 64 patients, 11 patients would not have been enrolled in the analysis if gastric  were not included in the modified criteria. In addition, 10 of the 64 variant carriers (15.6%) had medical history of gastric . Furthermore, the standardized incidence ratio of gastric  in the LS patients to the Japanese population is estimated to be as high as 20.. These data underscore the importance of gastric  in the diagnosis and healthcare of Japanese LS patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661908>In Vivo Evidence for Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel Expression in Carcinomas and Potentiation of Metastasis.</a></h1><p>A wide body of evidence suggests that voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are expressed de novo in several human carcinomas where channel activity promotes a variety of cellular behaviours integral to the metastatic cascade. These include directional motility (including galvanotaxis), pH balance, extracellular proteolysis, and invasion. Contrary to the substantial in vitro data, however, evidence for VGSC involvement in the  process in vivo is limited. Here, we critically assess, for the first time, the available in vivo evidence, hierarchically from mRNA level to emerging clinical aspects, including protein-level studies, electrolyte content, animal tests, and clinical imaging. The evidence strongly suggests that different VGSC subtypes (mainly Nav1.5 and Nav1.7) are expressed de novo in human carcinoma tissues and generally parallel the situation in vitro. Consistent with this, tissue electrolyte (sodium) levels, quantified by clinical imaging, are significantly higher in  vs. matched non- tissues. These are early events in the acquisition of metastatic potential by the  cells. Taken together, the multi-faceted evidence suggests that the VGSC expression has clinical (diagnostic and therapeutic) potential as a prognostic marker, as well as an anti-metastatic target. The distinct advantages offered by the VGSC include especially (1) its embryonic nature, demonstrated most clearly for the predominant neonatal Nav1.5 expression in breast and , and () the specifically druggable persistent current that VGSCs develop under hypoxic conditions, as in growing tumours, which promotes invasiveness and metastasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563625>Colorectal  Incidence and Mortality After Removal of Adenomas During Screening Colonoscopies.</a></h1><p>Recommendation of surveillance colonoscopy should be based on risk of colorectal  and death after adenoma removal. We aimed to develop risk classification system based on colorectal  incidence and mortality following adenoma removal.We performed a multicenter population-based cohort study of 236,089 individuals (median patient age, 56 years; 37.8% male) undergoing screening colonoscopies with adequate bowel cleansing and cecum intubation at 132 centers in the Polish National Colorectal  Screening Program, from 2000 through 2011. Subjects were followed for a median 7.1 years and information was collected on colorectal  development and death. We used recursive partitioning and multivariable Cox models to identify associations between colorectal  risk and patient and adenoma characteristics (diameter, growth pattern, grade of dysplasia and number of adenomas). We developed a risk classification system based on standardized incidence ratios, using data from the Polish population for comparison. The primary endpoints were colorectal  incidence and colorectal  death.We identified 130 colorectal cancers in individuals who had adenomas removed at screening (46.5 per 100,000 person-years) vs 309 in individuals without adenomas (22. per 100,000 person-years). Compared with individuals without adenomas, adenomas ≥20 mm in diameter and high-grade dysplasia were associated with increased risk of colorectal  (adjusted hazard ratios, 9.25; 95% CI, 6.39-13.39 and 3.58; 95% CI, 1.96-6.54, respectively). Compared with the general population, colorectal  risk was higher or comparable only for individuals with adenomas ≥20 mm in diameter (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], .07; 95% CI, 1.40-.93) or with high-grade dysplasia (SIR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.39-1.41), whereas for individuals with other adenoma characteristics the risk was lower (SIR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.28-0.44). We developed a high-risk classification based on adenoma size ≥20 mm or high-grade dysplasia (instead of the current high-risk classification cutoff of ≥3 adenomas or any adenoma with villous growth pattern, high-grade dysplasia, or ≥10 mm in diameter). Our classification system would reduce the number of individuals classified as high-risk and requiring intensive surveillance from 15,242 (36.5%) to 3980 (9.5%), without increasing risk of colorectal  in patients with adenomas (risk difference per 100,000 person-years, 5.6; 95% CI, -10.7 to 22.0).Using data from the Polish National Colorectal  Screening Program, we developed a risk classification system that would reduce the number of individuals classified as high risk and require intensive surveillance more than 3-fold, without increasing risk of colorectal  in patients with adenomas. This system could optimize the use of surveillance colonoscopy.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Despite positive evidence for this therapy, IDDS remains underutilized to treat  pain. Real-world registry data augment existing safety and effectiveness data and are presented here to broaden awareness of this therapeutic option, needed for adequate -related pain treatment, and as a viable tool addressing concerns with systemic opioid use.This prospective, long-term, multicenter (United States, Western Europe, and Latin America) registry started in 2003 to monitor the performance of SynchroMed Infusion Systems. Patient-reported outcomes were added in 2013. Before data acquisition, all sites obtained Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approval and written patient consent. The study was registered ( at clinicaltrials.gov) before patients were enrolled. Patients who provided informed consent were enrolled in the registry at initial IDDS implant or replacement.Through July 2017, 1403 patients with  pain were enrolled and implanted. The average (minimum/maximum) age of patients was 59 years (13/93 years), with 56.6% female. The most frequent  types were lung, breast, /rectal, pancreatic, and prostate. The majority of patients whose registry follow-up ended (87%; 1141/1311) were followed through death, with 4.3% (n = 57) exiting due to device explant or therapy discontinuation; the remaining 113 (8.6%) discontinued for reasons such as transfer of care, lost to follow-up, and site closure. Pain scores within the cohort of patients providing baseline and follow-up data improved significantly at 6 (P = .0007; n = 103) and 12 (P = .0026; n = 55) months compared to baseline, with EuroQol with 5 dimensions (EuroQol-5D) scores showing significant improvement at 6 months (P = .0016; n = 41).

The distribution of Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Summary Stage for 12 malignancies was examined. We estimated net survival by stage up to 5 years after diagnosis, controlling for background mortality with life tables of all-cause mortality in the general population by single year of age, sex, and calendar period. Survival estimates were age-standardised using the International  Survival Standard (ICSS) weights.Only 14.% of patients were diagnosed at a localised stage and 38.9% at the regional stage. The proportion of patients with known stage was 88.9% during 2000-2004 but fell to 59.4% during 2010-2013. During 2005-2009, 1- and 5-year survival for , rectal, breast, cervical, and prostate  was about 90% or higher for patients diagnosed at the localised stage. During 2004-2009, the proportion of patients diagnosed at a localised stage was lower in Kuwait than in the US for , breast, and lung . Age-standardised 5-year net survival for all stages combined was lower in Kuwait than the US for , lung, and breast , but stage-specific survival was similar.Since stage-specific survival is similar in Kuwait and the US, late stage at diagnosis is likely to be a major contributing factor to the overall lower survival in Kuwait than in the US. Increasing public awareness of  risk factors and symptoms and investment in early detection will be vital to reduce the proportion of patients diagnosed at a late stage and to improve survival.Copyright © 2019 E.

These SCFAs are potent preventive agents against colorectal  due to their histone deacetylases inhibitory properties, which induce apoptosis in tumor colonocytes. As colorectal  is the fourth most common neoplasia in Europe with 28. new cases per 100,000 inhabitants, a cost-effective preventive strategy has been tested in this work by redesigning common porcine meat products (chorizo sausages and cooked ham) consumed by a substantial proportion of the population towards potential colorectal  preventive functional foods. In order to test the preventive effect of these inulin-rich meat products against colorectal , an animal model (Rattus norvegicus F344) was used, involving two doses of azoxymethane (10 mg/kg) and two treatments with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) during a 20-week assay period. Control feed, control sausages, functional sausages (15.7% inulin), control cooked ham and functional cooked ham (10% inulin) were used to feed the corresponding animal cohorts. Then, the animals were sacrificed and their digestive tract tissues were analyzed. The results showed a statistically significant 49% reduction in the number of  polyps in the functional meat products cohorts with respect to the control meat products animals, as well as an increase in the cecum weight (an indicator of a diet rich in prebiotic fiber), a 51.8% increase in  propionate production, a 39.1% increase in  butyrate concentrations, and a reduction in the number of hyperplastic Peyer's patches. Metagenomics studies also demonstrated  microbiota differences, revealing a significant increase in Bacteroidetes populations in the functional meat products (mainly due to an increase in Bacteroidaceae and Prevotellaceae families, which include prominent propionate producers), together with a reduction in Firmicutes (especially due to lower Lachnospiraceae populations). However, functional meat products showed a remarkable increase in the anti-inflammatory and fiber-fermentative Blautia genus, which belongs to this Lachnospiraceae family. The functional meat products cohorts also presented a reduction in important pro-inflammatory bacterial populations, such as those of the genus Desulfovibrio and Bilophila. These results were corroborated in a genetic animal model of CRC (F344/NSlc-Apc) that produced similar results. Therefore, processed meat products can be redesigned towards functional prebiotic foods of interest as a cost-effective dietary strategy for preventing colorectal  in human populations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569095>Current Management of Malignant Colorectal Polyps Across a Regional United Kingdom  Network.</a></h1><p>The incidence of malignant colorectal polyps has increased secondary to the greater use of diagnostic colonoscopy and introduction of screening programs. Faced with the dilemma of whether major resection is required or whether polypectomy has been sufficient treatment, the clinician relies on high- and low-risk histologic parameters to guide decision-making.The purpose of this study was to review current practice and evaluate multidisciplinary team decision-making across a United Kingdom Regional  Network to establish the efficacy of previously set guidance from the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland (2013).This was a retrospective cohort study.The study was conducted at a United Kingdom Regional  Network composed of 4 separate National Health Service Hospital Trusts, covering an overall population of 1.5 million.All patients with malignant colorectal polyps who presented to the colorectal multidisciplinary team over a 3-year period (January 4, 2012 to January 4, 2015) were included.Rate of residual disease after major resection, recurrence of  after polypectomy and surveillance alone, reporting of histologic features, adherence to endoscopic surveillance guidelines, and outcomes of surveillance cross-sectional imaging were measured.A total of173 patients (median age = 69 y) with a malignant colorectal polyp were identified during the study period, with a median of .7 years of follow-up. Thirty-seven patients (21.4%) underwent primary surgical resection with a residual disease rate of 43% (16/37). The remaining 136 patients (76.8%) were managed conservatively with recurrence in 6 cases (4.4%). Endoscopic follow-up at 3 months occurred in 61% of cases. Histologic reporting was varied, with tumor differentiation and resection margin being reported in 84% of cases and lymphovascular invasion and depth of invasion in 71% and 59% of cases.This was an observational retrospective study.The residual disease rate in patients treated surgically was higher than previously reported (43.%). Incidence of recurrence in patients treated conservatively was low (4.4%). Areas of improvements have been identified in adherence to endoscopic follow-up, histopathologic reporting, and potential overuse of radiologic surveillance.

Immunoassay has been a powerful tool for this purpose, in which antibodies or their mimics particularly molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are used for specific recognition. Epitope and glycan are two structure features of a glycoprotein. However, immunoassays based on simultaneous recognition towards the two characteristics have been scarcely explored so far. Herein we present a new strategy called orthogonal dual molecularly imprinted polymer-based plasmonic immunosandwich assay (odMIP-PISA). It relies on double recognition towards a target glycoprotein by two different types of MIPs, using epitope-imprinted gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)-coated slide as capturing substrate to recognize the peptide epitope and glycans-imprinted Raman-active silver nanoparticles as labeling nanotags to recognize the glycans. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a routinely used marker for , was used as a test glycoprotein. The orthogonal double recognition apparently improved the specificity, reducing the maximum cross-reactivity from 14.4% for epitope recognition and 15.% for glycan recognition to 8.% for double recognition. Meanwhile, the plasmonic nanostructure-based Raman detection provided ultrahigh sensitivity, yielding a limit of detection of 5.56 × 10 M (S/N = 10). Through measuring the CEA level in human serum, this method permitted differentiation of  patient from healthy individual. Compared with the traditional immunoassay, odMIP-PISA exhibited multiple advantages, including simplified procedure (6 steps), speed (30 min), reduced cost, and so on. Therefore, this new approach holds great promise in many applications particularly clinical diagnosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Overall, 1213 colorectal cancers were observed versus 954.91 expected within a period of observation entailing an SIR of 1.27 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-1.34]. Significantly higher risk of colorectal  was found both in male and female patients with diabetes in all age groups. Higher risk was found for both  and rectum cancers 1.36 (95% CI: 1.27-1.46) and 1.11 (95% CI: 1.01-1.22), respectively. There were no differences in risk over time since initial diabetes diagnosis. Never-users of metformin had twice higher risk of colorectal  compared to general population (SIR: .14, 95% CI: 1.95-.35). Among metformin users, risk was lover (SIR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.36-1.58) and colorectal  risk decreased with increasing cumulative dose of metformin (P < 0.001). Patients with T2DM had increased risk of colorectal  compared with the general Lithuanian population. Decreasing colorectal  risk with increasing cumulative dose of metformin indicates that metformin may be a protective agent for colorectal  development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614548>Understanding the Interplay between COX- and hTERT in Colorectal  Using a Multi-Omics Analysis.</a></h1><p>Cyclooxygenase  (COX-) is involved in the initial steps of colorectal  (CRC) formation, playing a key role in the catalysis of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin E2 (PGE). The human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT or TERT) also plays an important role in colorectal  growth, conferring sustained cell proliferation and survival. Although hTERT induces COX- expression in gastric and cervical , their interaction has not been investigated in the context of CRC.COX-, PGE levels, and telomerase activity were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and TRAP assay in 49 colorectal  samples. PTGS1, PTGS2, PTGES3, TERT mRNA, and protein levels were investigated using RNA-seq and antibody-based protein profiling data from the TCGA and HPA projects. A multi-omics comparison was performed between PTGS2 and TERT, using RNAseq, DNA methylation, copy number variations (CNVs), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and insertions/deletions (Indels) data.COX- expression was positive in 40/49 CRCs, bearing cytoplasmic and heterogeneous staining, from moderate to high intensity. COX- staining was mainly detected in the stroma of the tumor cells and the adjacent normal tissues. PGE expression was lower in CRC compared to the adjacent normal tissue, and inversely correlated to telomerase activity in right  cancers. COX-1 and COX- were anticorrelated with TERT. Isoform structural analysis revealed the most prevalent transcripts driving the differential expression of PTGS1, PTGS2, PTGES3, and TERT in CRC. COX- expression was significantly higher among B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase, mutant (BRAF) tumors. Kirsten ras oncogene (KRAS) mutations did not affect COX- or TERT expression. The promoter regions of COX- and TERT were reversely methylated.Our data support that COX- is involved in the early stages of colorectal  development, initially affecting the tumor's stromal microenvironment, and, subsequently, the epithelial cells. They also highlight an inverse correlation between COX- expression and telomerase activity in CRC, as well as differentially methylated patterns within the promoter regions of COX- and TERT.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559369>Genetic Counseling and Surveillance Focused on Lynch Syndrome.</a></h1><p>Lynch syndrome is a hereditary  syndrome caused by germline mutations in one of several DNA mismatch repair genes. Lynch syndrome leads to an increased lifetime risk of various cancers, particularly colorectal, and endometrial cancers. After identifying patients suspected of having Lynch syndrome by clinical criteria, computational prediction models, and/or universal tumor testing, genetic testing is performed to confirm the diagnosis. Before and after genetic testing, genetic counseling should be provided. Genetic counseling should involve a detailed personal and family history, information on the disorder and genetic tests, discussion of the management and surveillance of the disease, career plan, family plan, and psychosocial support. Surveillance of colorectal  and other malignancies is of paramount importance for properly managing Lynch syndrome. This review focuses on important considerations in genetic counseling and the latest insights into the surveillance of individuals and families with Lynch syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630373>CDX2 Protein Expression in Colorectal  and ItsCorrelation with Clinical and Pathological Characteristics, Prognosis, and Survival Rate of Patients.</a></h1><p>Caudal-type homeobox transcription factor  (CDX2) is expressed in the nucleus of the intestinal epithelial cells and is essential for embryonic formation and differentiation of the intestine, whose reduced expression can result in metastatic tumors. This study was to investigate the association of CDX2 expression level in colorectal  (CRC) with age, gender, microscopic histopathology, tumor staging, tumor grading, 3-year survival rate, and prognosis.After preparing paraffin tissue blocks, CDX2 protein expression was assayed by immunohistochemistry in 82 CRC patients. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to detect tumor histology, tumor grading, tumor staging, and blood-lymphatic, and neural invasion. The collected data includes age, gender, tumor site, and 3-year survival rate of patients after diagnosis.The CDX2 expression was significantly higher in men than in women, and it was significantly lower in right-sided tumors as in transverse  and left-sided tumors. Also, the CDX2 expression was significantly higher in adenocarcinoma than in mucinous. In addition, a significant correlation was found between downregulated CDX2 and lymph node involvement. In tumor grading, there was a significant correlation between CDX2 downregulation and high-grade tumor. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between downregulated CDX2 expression and overall pathological staging.The downregulated CDX2 expression is associated with female gender, right-sided tumors, mucinous tumors, lymph node involvement, high-grade tumor, and advanced overall pathological staging and can be considered as a possible prognostic factor for patients follow-up. However, our study is a preliminary study and further studies with larger sample sizes in different ethnic groups are required.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565080>The microRNA-200 family acts as an oncogene in colorectal  by inhibiting the tumor suppressor RASSF2.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to determine whether manipulation of the microRNA-200 (miR-200) family could influence  adenocarcinoma cell behavior. The miR-200 family has a significant role in tumor suppression and functions as an oncogene.  studies on gain and loss of function with small interfering RNA demonstrated that the miR-200 family could regulate RASSF2 expression. Knockdown of the miR-200 family in the HT-29  cell line increased KRAS expression but decreased signaling in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway through reduced ERK phosphorylation. Increased expression of the miR-200 family in the CCD-841  epithelium cell line increased KRAS expression and led to increased signaling in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway but increased ERK phosphorylation. Functionally, knockdown of the miR-200 family led to decreased cell proliferation in the HT-29 cells; therefore, increased miR-200 family expression could increase cell proliferation in the CCD-841 cell line. The present study included a large paired miR array dataset (n=632), in which the miR-200 family was significantly found to be increased in  when compared with normal adjacent  epithelium. In a miR-seq dataset (n=199), the study found that miR-200 family expression was increased in localized  compared with metastatic disease. Decreased expression was associated with poorer overall survival. The miR-200 family directly targeted RASSF2 and was inversely correlated with RASSF2 expression (n=199, all P<0.001). Despite the well-defined role of the miR-200 family in tumor suppression, the present findings demonstrated a novel function of the miR-200 family in tumor proliferation.Copyright: © Carter et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595401>Training interventions to improve adenoma detection rates during colonoscopy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Colonoscopies are effective means of detecting and removing precancerous adenomatous polyps. The adenoma detection rate (ADR) is a marker of colonoscopy quality and an independent predictor of colorectal  incidence. Focused training interventions may improve an endoscopist's ADR, but the supporting research is limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis identified, critically appraised, and meta-analyzed data from randomized trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of training interventions on ADRs.Ovid Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Eric, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for RCTs investigating the effect of an educational intervention on ADRs. Two reviewers independently screened, identified, and extracted trial-level data. Internal validity was assessed in duplicate using the Risk of Bias tool. Our primary outcome was the ADR. Secondary outcomes were advanced ADR, adenocarcinoma detection rate, polyp detection rate, and withdrawal times. Safety outcomes were post-polypectomy bleeding rate and colonoscopy-related perforation rate.From 2837 screened citations, we identified 3 trials (119 endoscopists) meeting our inclusion criteria. Training interventions were associated with a trend toward increased ADRs (odds ratio 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.34; I 83%; 3 trials; 119 endoscopists). When limited to screening colonoscopies, the odds ratio for ADRs associated with training interventions was 1.17 (95% CI 1.00-1.36; I 80%; 3 trials; 119 endoscopists). There was a high level of heterogeneity between the trials' training interventions. Training intervention improved the advanced ADR, adenocarcinoma detection rate, polyp detection rate, and withdrawal times. Safety outcomes were not reported.A focused training intervention was associated with a strong trend toward increased ADRs among certified endoscopists. While the described training interventions definitely show promise, further efforts around continuing professional developments activities are needed to more consistently improve ADRS among certified endoscopists.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621322>Structurally Modified Cyclopenta[]benzofuran Analogues Isolated from .</a></h1><p>Four new cyclopenta[]benzofuran derivatives based on an unprecedented carbon skeleton (-), with a dihydrofuran ring fused to dioxanyl and aryl rings, along with a new structural analogue () of 5‴-episilvestrol (episilvestrol, ), were isolated from an aqueous extract of a large-scale re-collection of the roots of  collected in Vietnam.

We have designed and synthesized a series of dual agents as both Eg5 inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, bearing a 4-aryldihydropyrimidine core. Compound  (aryl: 3-nitrophenyl) was selected as potential dual agent due to displaying both activities: it is a vasorelaxant agent (>90% relaxation at 10 M in KCl-precontracted aorta rings), it decreases the response to calcium and it is cytotoxic to MCF-7 (breast), HCT-116 () and A-549 (lung)  cell lines.

Hypomagnesemia is a comparatively frequent adverse event of this drug, which is likely overlooked because it occurs later in treatment without symptoms. Furthermore, hypomagnesemia and hypomagnesemia-induced corrected QT (QTc) prolongation may lead to loss of consciousness (LOC), the onset of which is not generally considered associated with the treatment of anti-EGFR antibody because of its rare occurrence. Here, we present a colorectal  patient treated with anti-EGFR antibody, who suffered LOC during treatment while severe hypomagnesemia or QTc prolongation was not observed.A 69-year-old man with metastatic  was treated with cetuximab (anti-EGFR antibody) plus irinotecan as third-line chemotherapy. His serum magnesium level gradually decreased, and grade  hypomagnesemia (a serum magnesium level of 0.9 mg/dL) was observed at the 12th administration of cetuximab. In light of this development, intravenous supplementation of 20 mEq magnesium sulfate began with careful blood monitoring despite the lack of clinical symptoms. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed prolonged QT or corrected QT (QTc) intervals (grade 1). His serum magnesium level remained at 0.9 mg/dL, and no hypomagnesemia symptoms were observed by the 17th administration of cetuximab. After the treatment, however, he suddenly lost consciousness without symptoms related to infusion or allergic reactions. Circulatory collapse following dermatological reactions and respiratory events were not evident. Intravenous supplementation of magnesium sulfate was administered again. He awakened  min after the onset of temporary LOC without any other symptoms related to hypomagnesemia, such as lethargy, tremor, tetany, and seizures. No other etiology outside of the low level of serum magnesium was confirmed in further examinations. Cetuximab was discontinued, and his serum magnesium level returned to a level within the normal range after 6 weeks. Because of tumor progression, regorafenib and TAS-102 (trifluridine tipiracil hydrochloride) were introduced sequentially for 6 months. Five months after the final treatment of TAS-102, he died of his primary disease, which reflected a survival period of 4 years and 6 months since the beginning of treatment.This case report reminds clinicians that LOC can be induced without severe hypomagnesemia or QTc prolongation, during anti-EGFR antibody treatment for metastatic colorectal  even while under carefully monitored magnesium supplementation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636470>Role of ion channels in gastrointestinal .</a></h1><p>In their seminal papers Hanahan and Weinberg described oncogenic processes a normal cell undergoes to be transformed into a  cell. The functions of ion channels in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract influence a variety of cellular processes, many of which overlap with these hallmarks of . In this review we focus on the roles of the calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl) and zinc (Zn) transporters in GI , with a special emphasis on the roles of the KCNQ1 K channel and CFTR Cl channel in colorectal  (CRC). Ca is a ubiquitous second messenger, serving as a signaling molecule for a variety of cellular processes such as control of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and migration. Various members of the TRP superfamily, including TRPM8, TRPM7, TRPM6 and TRPM2, have been implicated in GI cancers, especially through overexpression in pancreatic adenocarcinomas and down-regulation in . Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are classically associated with the initiation and conduction of action potentials in electrically excitable cells such as neurons and muscle cells. The VGSC Na1.5 is abundantly expressed in human colorectal CRC cell lines as well as being highly expressed in primary CRC samples. Studies have demonstrated that conductance through Na1.5 contributes significantly to CRC cell invasiveness and  progression. Zn transporters of the ZIP/SLC39A and ZnT/SLC30A families are dysregulated in all major GI organ cancers, in particular, ZIP4 up-regulation in pancreatic  (PC). More than 70 K channel genes, clustered in four families, are found expressed in the GI tract, where they regulate a range of cellular processes, including gastrin secretion in the stomach and anion secretion and fluid balance in the intestinal tract. Several distinct types of K channels are found dysregulated in the GI tract. Notable are hERG1 upregulation in PC, gastric  (GC) and CRC, leading to enhanced  angiogenesis and invasion, and KCNQ1 down-regulation in CRC, where KCNQ1 expression is associated with enhanced disease-free survival in stage II, III, and IV disease. Cl channels are critical for a range of cellular and tissue processes in the GI tract, especially fluid balance in the . Most notable is CFTR, whose deficiency leads to mucus blockage, microbial dysbiosis and inflammation in the intestinal tract. CFTR is a tumor suppressor in several GI cancers. Cystic fibrosis patients are at a significant risk for CRC and low levels of CFTR expression are associated with poor overall disease-free survival in sporadic CRC. Two other classes of chloride channels that are dysregulated in GI cancers are the chloride intracellular channels (CLIC1, 3 & 4) and the chloride channel accessory proteins (CLCA1,,4). CLIC1 & 4 are upregulated in PC, GC, gallbladder , and CRC, while the CLCA proteins have been reported to be down-regulated in CRC. In summary, it is clear, from the diverse influences of ion channels, that their aberrant expression and/or activity can contribute to malignant transformation and tumor progression. Further, because ion channels are often localized to the plasma membrane and subject to multiple layers of regulation, they represent promising clinical targets for therapeutic intervention including the repurposing of current drugs.©The Author(s) 2019.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of low-dose ethanol (0.5%, 1%, and % [v/v] ethanol in drinking water) for 28 wk on  tumor incidence in rats injected with 1,-dimethylhydrazine. Body weight, fluid and food consumption, and the total numbers of  adenomas (mild-, moderate-, and severe-grade dysplasia) per rat were unaffected by ethanol consumption. However, the numbers of severe-grade dysplasia were significantly reduced by 1% ethanol compared with the control (0% ethanol; -93%) but not by 0.5% and % ethanol. Although the numbers of total adenocarcinomas were unaffected, those of total of adenomas and adenocarcinomas together were significantly reduced by 0.5% and 1% ethanol (-39% and -41%, respectively). Intriguingly, real-time PCR assay indicated the abundance of cecal Clostridium leptum (a putative immunosuppressor) was the least in rats received 1% ethanol. Furthermore, 1% ethanol markedly increased  mRNA of IL-6, a putative suppressor of regulatory T-cells and cytoprotector. This study provides the first evidence for the potential of 1% ethanol, but not % ethanol, to prevent  tumorigenesis in rats, supporting the J-curve hypothesis of the effect of low-dose alcohol on health. Further, the modulation of C. leptum and expression of IL-6, potentially linking to carcinogenesis, by 1% ethanol may provide an insight into the underlying mechanisms of the anti- tumor effect.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587439>Adjuvant therapy with γ-tocopherol-induce apoptosis in HT-29  via cyclin-dependent cell cycle arrest mechanism.</a></h1><p>Resistance to chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with colorectal  (CRC) is the major obstacle to reach the maximum efficiency of CRC treatment.

Cytotoxic effect of this combination was examined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol--yl)-,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and a synergistic effect was evaluated by a combination index technique. Nuclear morphology was studied via 4',6-diamidino--phenylindole staining and flow cytometric assays were conducted to identify molecular mechanisms of apoptosis and cell cycle progression. We investigated the expression of Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, Bax, and Bcl- by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The IC values for 5-FU and γ-tocopherol were 21.8  ± .5 and 14.4 ± .6 μM, respectively, and also this combination therapeutic increased the percentage of apoptotic cells from 35% ± % to 40% ±  4% (P  <  .05). Furthermore, incubation HT-29  cells with combined concentrations of two drugs caused significant accumulation of cells in the subGsubG1 phase.

To verify the in vivo data, the anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects of BE were determined with an in vitro cell model.HPLC analysis showed that BI was quickly transformed into BE by the intestinal microbiota. Oral BE (30 mg/kg/day) significantly increased the life span, from 125. to 218.4 days (P < 0.01%). BE treatment also decreased intestine index and increased spleen index. Compared with the model group, following BE treatment, tumor numbers were significantly reduced in the small intestine and  (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively). In the gut tissues, BE treatment significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine levels such as IL-1β, IL-, IL-6, IL-10, G-CSF, and GM-CSF. In vitro data supported our in vivo results that the anti-CRC effects of BE were via the inhibition of gut inflammation and induction of  cell death.Our results suggest that the parent compound BI can be quickly converted into its microbial metabolite BE, which has stronger bioactive effects than BI. Baicalein is an active chemopreventive metabolite for inflammatory associated CRC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615647>[Epidemiology, treatment and prognosis of colorectal  in young adults in sub-Saharan Africa].</a></h1><p>Colorectal  is the most common digestive . The objectives of this study was to analyse the frequency, aetiologies, and the therapeutic and progressive aspects of colorectal  in young adults in Burkina Faso. This study was a 10-years descriptive study conducted in  regional hospitals in Burkina Faso. It included all patients aged 20 to 45 years admitted to these two hospitals for  or rectal  during the study period. A total of 116 patients were included, which was 39.% of all patients admitted for colorectal  during the same period. The average age of the included patients was 35.4 years old. There were 70 male patients (60.3%). Seven patients had a history of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and six had a family history of . The average consultation time was 6. months. In 25 cases (19.9%), the  was discovered in the context of an abdominal emergency. Ninety-two patients (79.3%) were diagnosed at stage 3 or stage 4 according to the TNM Staging System. The most common histological type was adenocarcinoma (103 cases, 88.9%). Therapeutically, surgery was performed on 87 patients (75%) and chemotherapy was used in 37 cases (31.9%). Sixteen patients received radiotherapy. The intra operative mortality rate was 4.6%. The 5-year survival rate was 17%. In conclusion, colorectal  in young adults occurs without obvious risk factors in Burkina Faso. Mortality remains high because of the limited therapeutic arsenal.Copyright © 2019 Société Française du . Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

The pharmacokinetic studies were carried out in healthy rats, following the i.v. injection of a single dose of LCL-CURC-DOX (1 mg/kg DOX). For the tissue distribution study, DOX concentration in tumors, heart and liver were measured after the administration of two i.v. doses of LCL-CURC-DOX (.5 mg/kg DOX and 5 mg/kg CURC) to Balb/c mice bearing C26  tumors. Markers of murine cardiac and hepatic oxidative status were determined to provide additional insights into the benefit of co-encapsulating CURC and DOX in LCL over DOX-induced adverse effects in these organs. The current study demonstrated that the liposomal association of CURC and DOX effectively improved the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of DOX, limiting its side effects, via CURC-dependent antioxidant effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673529>Expression of CXC Chemokine Receptors in Acute Ulcerative Colitis: Initial Study from an Animal Model.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory disease which is characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells, crypt abscesses, distortion of the mucosal glands, and goblet cell depletion. The existence of neutrophil-rich inflammation in  tissues of patients with UC is one of the most significant histological features of this disease. Nonetheless, the expression of CXCR chemokine receptors which appear as the main chemical mediators governing the migration of neutrophils into the mucosal tissue of patients with UC has not been well clarified.In this experimental study, the UC model was induced in Wistar rats by administration of  ml 4% acetic acid into the large  through the rectum. Animals were anesthetized after 48 h; their  tissue samples were isolated for macroscopic and histopathological examination. The expression of receptor of CXC chemokine was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) technique.Heavy infiltration of neutrophils, coagulative necrosis, and ulcers were observed in H and E staining, which pathologically proved the UC model. qRT-PCR results indicated that CXCR2 as one of the important ELR chemokine family receptors bears the highest expression in the UC group (32 fold) than the control group ( ≤ 0.05). In addition, other CXCRs of this group including CXCR1 did not possess any change ( > 0.05). In contrast, RLR negative chemokine family receptors did not show any changes with the normal group.The results showed that CXCR2 is the only receptor for CXCL family which was remarkably upregulated in experimental UC and that CXCR2 might play a significant role in the pathogenesis of UC.Copyright: © 2019 Advanced Biomedical Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671666>Automated Workflow for Somatic and Germline Next Generation Sequencing Analysis in Routine Clinical  Diagnostics.</a></h1><p>Thanks to personalized medicine trends and collaborations between industry, clinical research groups and regulatory agencies, next generation sequencing (NGS) is turning into a common practice faster than one could have originally expected. When considering clinical applications of NGS in oncology, a rapid workflow for DNA extraction from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples, as well as producing high quality library preparation, can be real challenges. Here we consider these targets and how applying effective automation technology to NGS workflows may help improve yield, timing and quality-control. We firstly evaluated DNA recovery from archived FFPE blocks from three different manual extraction methods and two automated extraction workstations. The workflow was then implemented to somatic (lung/ panel) and germline () library preparation for NGS analysis exploiting two automated workstations. All commercial kits gave good results in terms of DNA yield and quality. On the other hand, the automated workstation workflow has been proven to be a valid automatic extraction system to obtain high quality DNA suitable for NGS analysis (lung/ Ampli-seq panel). Moreover, it can be efficiently integrated with an open liquid handling platform to provide high-quality libraries from germline DNA with more reproducibility and high coverage for targeted sequences in less time (). The introduction of automation in routine workflow leads to an improvement of NGS standardization and increased scale up of sample preparations, reducing labor and timing, with optimization of reagents and management.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655897>Cytotoxic platinum(II) complexes derived from saccharinate and phosphine ligands: synthesis, structures, DNA cleavage, and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.</a></h1><p>A series of the structurally related platinum(II) saccharinate (sac) complexes with alkylphenylphosphines, namely cis-[Pt(sac)(PPhMe)]·DMSO (1), cis-[Pt(sac)(PPhMe)] (), cis-[Pt(sac)(PPhEt)] (3), and cis-[Pt(sac)(PPhEt)]·2DMSO (4), were synthesized and fully characterized; their structures were determined by X-ray crystallography.

The experience among taTME surgeons beyond their learning curve is limited.A retrospective analysis of all taTME cases performed for rectal  at two tertiary care hospitals from 2014 to 2019 was conducted. Transanal surgeons had previously performed > 50 taTME cases. Demographic, perioperative, and short-term outcomes were analyzed.Among 54 taTME patients, 74.1% were male and 27.8% had a BMI ≥ 30. Tumors were stage I (8), II (13), III (29), and IV (4). Complex cases included 4 local recurrences, 4 prior liver resections, and  with prior prostate . Thirty tumors were located ≤ 6 cm from the anal verge. On staging MRI, 12 had a positive predicted circumferential radial margin (+CRM), and 4 had internal anal sphincter involvement (+IAS). Forty-seven patients received neoadjuvant therapy. A -team approach was used in 51 patients with laparoscopic (83.3%) or robotic (16.7%) abdominal assistance with a 9.% conversion rate. Low anterior resection with sphincter salvage was achieved in 87% with 8 patients requiring intersphincteric resection. Anastomoses were hand-sewn in 57.4% and all patients were diverted. Median LOS was 5 days with a 42.6% 30-day morbidity rate and 3 postoperative mortalities (ARDS, pulmonary embolism and pseudomembranous colitis). Complete and near complete TME grade was achieved in 94.4% with a 3.7% rate of +CRM.

Our aim was to identify prognostic factors of overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients treated for OCC.From 2000 to 2015, 2325 patients were treated for OCC in French surgical centers, members of the French National Surgical Association (AFC). Patients with palliative management were excluded. The main endpoints were OS and DFS. A multivariate analysis, using Cox proportional hazards regression model, was performed to determine independent prognostic factors.The cohort included 2120 patients. The median of follow-up was 13. months. In multivariate analysis, age > 75 years, ASA score ≥ 3, ECOG score ≥ 3, right-sided , presence of synchronous metastases, anastomotic leakage, and absence of adjuvant chemotherapy were independent OS factors. Age > 75 years, ASA score ≥ 3, right-sided , presence of synchronous metastases, and absence of postoperative chemotherapy were independent factors of poor OS after exclusion of patients who died postoperatively. Age ≥ 75 years, ASA score ≥ 3, ECOG score ≥ 3, right-sided , lymph node involvement, presence of vascular, lymphatic or perineural invasion, less than 12 harvested lymph nodes, and absence of adjuvant chemotherapy were independent DFS factors.Management of OCC should take into account prognostic factors related to the patient (age, comorbidities), tumor location, and tumor stage.

The relationship between sentinel polyps (rectal polyps with proximal ) and proximal  has received extensive attention in recent years. However, there is still no clear conclusion regarding the relationship.To investigate the clinical characteristics of sentinel polyps and their correlation with proximal .A retrospective analysis of 2587 patients with rectal polyps from January 2006 to December 2017 was performed. According to whether or not proximal  was diagnosed, the patients were divided into either a sentinel polyp group (192 patients) or a pure rectal polyp group (2395 patients). The endoscopic features, clinicopathological features, therapeutic effects, and short-term prognosis were analyzed and compared between the two groups.The mean age of patients in the sentinel polyp group was generally higher than that of the pure rectal polyp group, and the positivity rates of anemia, stool occult blood, and tumor markers of the sentinel polyp group were also significantly higher than those in the rectal polyp group (  = 90.56,  < 0.01;   = 70.30,  < 0.01;   = 92.80,  < 0.01). The majority of the patients in the sentinel polyp group had multiple polyps, large polyps, adenomatous polyps, or sessile polyps (  = 195.96,  < 0.01;   = 460.46,  < 0.01;   = 94.69,  < 0.01;   = 48.01,  < 0.01). Most of the proximal  cancers were Duke's A and B stages in the sentinel polyp group. In the pure rectal polyp group, 2203 patients underwent endoscopic treatment, and all of the patients were cured and discharged. In the sentinel polyp group, 65 patients underwent radical operation, and 61 patients received endoscopic submucosal dissection or endoscopic mucosal resection. Additionally, 21 patients were lost to follow-up after 6-12 mo, and the loss rate was 10.94%. A total of 63.16% of patients experienced remission without tumor recurrence or metastasis, 33.33% of patients experienced tumors regression or improved symptoms, and the other 3.51% of the patients died.If there are multiple, sessile, and adenomatous rectal polyps with a maximum diameter > 1 cm, the possibility of the carcinogenesis of the polyps or of the proximal  should be monitored closely. These patients should be followed in the short-term and should undergo a whole- examination.©The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

This study was undertaken to explore the role and therapeutic potential of PPM1D in .HT-29  cell line was used in this study. Expression analysis of PPMD1 was performed by qRT-PCR. Cell viability was determined by CCK-8 assay. DAPI, acridin orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) and propidium iodide (PI)staining assays were used for apoptosis detection. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Protein expression was determined by western blot analysis.The results showed that the expression of PPMD1 was significantly upregulated in  by 3. to 4.8 fold. Silencing of PPMD1 caused significant decline in the proliferation rate of the HT-29  cells that was due to induction of apoptosis as evidenced by DAPI, AO/EB and PI staining. Annexin V/PI showed a significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic of HT-29 cells upon silencing of PPMD1. The induction of apoptosis was also accompanied by increase in Bax and decrease in Bcl- expression. PPMD1 silencing also resulted in arrest of the HT-29 cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle which was also associated with upsurge of p21 and p53 and depletion of cyclin B1 expression levels. PPMD1 silencing also caused decrease in the viability of the HT-29 cells which was concomitant with suppression of MMP- and MMP-9 expression.These findings suggest that PPMD1 has oncogenic properties in  and exhibit therapeutic implications in  treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567928>Factors Predicting Operative Difficulty of Laparoscopic Total Mesorectal Excision.</a></h1><p>Laparoscopic total mesorectal excision is a challenging procedure requiring high-quality surgery for optimal outcomes. Patient, tumor, and pelvic factors are believed to determine difficulty, but previous studies were limited to postoperative data.This study aimed to report factors predicting laparoscopic total mesorectal excision performance by using objective intraoperative assessment.Data from a multicenter laparoscopic total mesorectal excision randomized trial (ISRCTN59485808) were reviewed.This study was conducted at 4 centers in the United Kingdom.A total of 71 patients underwent elective laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal adenocarcinoma with curative intent: 53% were men, mean age was 69 years, body mass index was 27.7, tumor height was 8.5 cm, 24% underwent neoadjuvant therapy, and 25% had previous surgery.Surgical performance was assessed through the identification of intraoperative adverse events by using observational clinical human reliability analysis. Univariate analysis and multivariate binomial regression were performed to establish factors predicting the number of intraoperative errors, surgeon-reported case difficulty, and short-term clinical and histopathological outcomes.A total of 1331 intraoperative errors were identified from 365 hours of surgery (median, 18 per case; interquartile range, 16-22; and range, 9-49). No patient, tumor, or bony pelvimetry measurement correlated with total or pelvic error count, surgeon-reported case difficulty, cognitive load, operative data, specimen quality, number or severity of 30-day morbidity events and length of stay (all r not exceeding ±0.26, p > 0.05). Mesorectal area was associated with major intraoperative adverse events (OR, 1.09; 95%CI, 1.01-1.16; p = 0.015) and postoperative morbidity (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.01-1.; p = 0.033). Obese men were subjectively reported as harder cases (24 vs 36 mm, p = 0.042), but no detrimental effects on performance or outcomes were seen.Our sample size is modest, risking type II errors and overfitting of the statistical models.Patient, tumor, and bony pelvic anatomical characteristics are not seen to influence laparoscopic total mesorectal excision operative difficulty.

The five image-based criteria (T3cd/T4, T3/T4, T3/T4 or N+, T3cd/T4 or N2, and T3/T4 with ≥ 4 cm) were evaluated in terms of diagnostic accuracy, interreader agreement, and overtreatment risk using pooled receiver-operating curve and Fleiss kappa analyses. Pathologic high-risk stage II or III was used as a reference standard for assessment of overtreatment risk.The diagnostic accuracy of multireaders was in the acceptable range (pooled area under curve (AUC): 0.751-0.829). T3/T4 showed the highest AUC (0.829) in terms of diagnostic accuracy. T3/T4 with ≥ 4 cm showed the highest kappa value (κ = 0.695) followed by T3/T4 (κ = 0.623), indicating substantial agreement.

Meanwhile HER2 amplification reportedly denoted CTX-resistant mCRC tumors. We investigated whether monitoring of HER2 amplification in circulating DNA allowed early detection of mCRC progression and CTX resistance.We analyzed HER2 amplification in circulating DNA at 8-week intervals using ddPCR from 36 patients with RAS/BRAF mCRC, who progressed after CTX treatments between July 2015 and January 2018.Of the 36 patients, 5 (13.9%) exhibited dynamic fluctuations of HER2 amplification in plasma in the course of CTX treatment, of whom  were positive for HER2 amplification in matched tumor specimens at baseline (per FISH). All 5 primary sites were left side: 3 rectums and  descending . HER2 ratio fluctuations in circulating DNA not only reflected changes in tumor volume, but their obvious increases presaged CT-documented progress by an average lead time of  months. Interestingly, progression-free survival did not significantly differ between these 5 patients and those without HER2 amplification (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.40-.77, P = 0.909).Plasma HER2 amplification detected by ddPCR changed over time and predicted resistance to CTX, by an average lead time of  months.

While the overall incidence is declining, it is rising alarmingly in young patients (EOCC). CC in young patients tends to be more aggressive and often diagnosed at more advanced stages and portend poorer prognosis. Our recently published data showed that EOCC is a distinct disease with unique molecular features compared to late-onset CC (LOCC). The Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein (COMP) was shown to be significantly upregulated in EOCC and correlated with poor survival. However, the role of COMP in CC tumorigenesis, especially in young patients, is not well understood. Thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate the role of COMP in CC tumorigenesis by modulating COMP levels in vitro and test how it affects proliferation. Then, patient samples were evaluated by testing the levels of proliferation marker Ki67. In addition, this study investigates whether higher transcriptional mRNA levels of COMP seen in more aggressive early-onset CC correlate with protein levels compared to late-onset CC.COMP mRNA levels in fresh frozen  tumors (young: n = 5; old: n = 5) were assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Additionally, CC cell lines were profiled for COMP expression to choose an in vitro model to study the role of COMP in CC tumorigenesis. HT-29 (low COMP expression) and CaCo- (high COMP expression) cells were used for in vitro proliferation studies. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was conducted to assess COMP and Ki67 protein levels in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)  tumors.Significantly higher COMP expression levels were observed in fresh frozen EOCC compared to LOCC tumors. This observation confirmed our previously reported results from NanoString gene expression assay using FFPE samples. Cell proliferation was significantly increased in HT-29 and CaCo- cells upon treatment with human recombinant COMP protein after 48 and 72 h (P < 0.05). This increase was more profound in HT-29 cells. Staining for COMP and Ki67 revealed high COMP protein levels in EOCC compared to LOCC patients.COMP mRNA and protein levels are significantly higher in EOCC patients. Higher COMP levels correlate with increased proliferation suggesting a role in CC tumorigenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564986>Treatment selection bias for chemotherapy persists in colorectal  patient cohort studies even in comprehensive propensity score analyses.</a></h1><p>Propensity score methods are increasingly used to address confounding related to treatment selection in observational studies. Studies estimating the effect of chemotherapy in  (CC) patients, however, often lacked information on pertinent comorbidities and functional status (FS). We assessed to what extent comorbidities and FS impact treatment decisions in colorectal  patients and explain the benefit of chemotherapy in stage III CC patients.Stage II-III colorectal  patients diagnosed in 2003-2014 and recruited into a population-based study were included (N=1102). Associations of comorbidity and FS with treatment patterns were examined with multivariable logistic regression. The contribution of lower comorbidity and higher FS to the benefit of chemotherapy was estimated with propensity score weighted Cox models in 430 stage III CC patients who were followed over a median time of 4.7 years.In stage II (high-risk) and III CC patients, Charlson comorbidity scores 1,  and 3+ were associated with 57%, 66% and 70% lower odds of chemotherapy use, respectively. In combination with older age and poor FS, comorbidity was associated with 97% and 83% decreased odds of adjuvant chemotherapy use in CC and rectal  patients, respectively. In stage III CC patients, lower comorbidity and higher FS explained 38% and 24% of the overall and disease-specific survival benefits of chemotherapy, respectively. Selection bias was observed even in the comprehensive models, as chemotherapy was still associated with substantially higher non-disease-specific survival (hazard ratio (HR): 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.46-0.92), especially in patients <75 years (HR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.17-0.63).Lower comorbidity and higher FS of recipients of chemotherapy explain approximately 40% of the benefits of chemotherapy in stage III CC patients. Regardless of how comprehensive propensity score analyses might be in observational studies, treatment selection bias might persist and affect estimates of treatment effects.© 2019 Boakye et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559353>Evolution of surgery for rectal : Transanal total mesorectal excision～new standard or fad?～.</a></h1><p>Transanal Total Mesorectal Excision (TaTME) has recently been developed to overcome the difficulties associated with conventional laparoscopic or robotic TME. TaTME has gained popularity and becomes the center of attention among colorectal surgeons globally. The present review aims to update the literature, clarify the current status and perspectives of TaTME. Complete TaTME specimens were obtained in 85-97.1% of the case; the reported circumferential resection margin (CRM) ranged from 1.5% to 8.1%, whereas and distal resection margin (DRM) positive rates ranged from 0% to 3.%. The conversion rate of TaTME occurred from 0 to 15%, and there was no difference between TaTME and laparoscopic or robotic TME. Intraoperative complications occurred in 5-6% of the case, which compared favorably to laparoscopic TME. The most serious intraoperative complication with this approach was urethral injury, although only small numbers were reported, which was possibly due to under-reporting. Clavien-Dindo I or II postoperative complications occurred in 22-24% of the case, and III or IV in 10-11% of the case, which did not differ between TaTME and laparoscopic or robotic TME. TaTME may be technically easier and more beneficial than laparoscopic, robotic or open TME in male patients with a narrow pelvis; in obese patients with a bulky tumor. At present two randomized controlled trials, COLOR III and GRECCAR, and comparing TaTME with laparoscopic TME are being conducted and their outcomes are awaited. TaTME is a complex procedure, but proved to be feasible, oncologically safe, and effective in difficult cases. Before this new technique is adopted, proper training with Proctor/mentorship is strongly advised.

Outcomes amassed from this investigation illustrate that  EO represents a rich source of pharmacologically active molecules which can be further validated and explored clinically for its therapeutic potential and for the development and design of new natural therapeutic preparations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596085>Synthetic and Biological Studies of Juglorubin and Related Naphthoquinones.</a></h1><p>Juglorubin, juglorescein, and juglocombins A/B are naturally occurring naphthoquinone dimers isolated from  sp. These dimers are proposed to be biogenetically derived from juglomycin C, a monomeric naphthoquinone isolated from the same  sp. In this study, the dimerization of a juglomycin C derivative, a key step in the total syntheses of these natural products, was investigated. Juglorubin was synthesized from the minor product of the dimerization via the formation of the juglocombin A/B stereoisomers. A mechanism for the dimerization reaction as well as a plausible biosynthetic pathway to obtain juglorubin from juglomycin C are proposed. Furthermore, the antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of five synthetic compounds were evaluated. Among the compounds tested in this study, 1'--methyljuglocombin B dimethyl ester and juglomycin C exhibited antibacterial activity against . 1'--Methyljuglocombin B dimethyl ester and juglomycin C showed cytotoxicity against human  carcinoma HCT116 cells and human leukemia HL-60 cells. 1'--Methyljuglocombin B dimethyl ester exhibited cytotoxicity against human normal MRC-5 cells as strong as that against human  cells. In contrast, juglomycin C was less toxic against normal MRC-5 cells, indicating a significant selectivity toward  cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582972>Long-Term Outcome in Patients with a Solitary Peutz-Jeghers Polyp.</a></h1><p>Clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with a solitary Peutz-Jeghers polyp (PJP) have not been fully investigated.Solitary PJP was diagnosed when a single hamartomatous lesion was identified in the gastrointestinal tract of patients without mucocutaneous pigmentation or a family history of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. We retrospectively reviewed 51 patients (32 men and 19 women) with a solitary PJP and analyzed the sex, age at diagnosis, endoscopic features, and outcomes in this patient group. The STK11/LKB1 germline mutation was not investigated in any of the patients.The mean age of the 51 patients was 66.1 years. The polyp was found in the duodenum ( = 10), jejunum ( = ), cecum ( = ), transverse  ( = 5), sigmoid  ( = 21), or rectum ( = 11). Most of the polyps presented as a pedunculated lesion ( = 40), followed by semipedunculated ( = 9) and sessile ( = ) morphologies. The mean size of a solitary PJP was 15.6 mm (range: 5 to 33 mm). During a mean endoscopic follow-up period of 4.5 years (range: 0.1 to 16.1 years), no recurrence was identified. Eighteen of the enrolled patients had a history of  or concomitant . Five patients died due to non-gastrointestinal-related causes. No additional  or death directly related to solitary PJP was observed.Solitary PJPs did not recur in this study. Although examination of the entire gastrointestinal tract using esophagogastroduodenoscopy, enteroscopy, and colonoscopy is desirable to exclude Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, follow-up endoscopy after endoscopic polyp resection may be unnecessary, once the diagnosis of a solitary PJP is made.Copyright © 2019 Masaya Iwamuro et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567929>Clinical Anastomotic Leakage After Rectal  Resection Can Be Predicted by Pelvic Anatomic Features on Preoperative MRI Scans: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h1><p>We demonstrated previously that radiation proctitis induced by preoperative radiotherapy is a predisposing factor for clinical anastomotic leakage in patients undergoing rectal  resection. Quantitative measurement of radiation proctitis is needed.This study aimed to quantitate the changes of anatomic features caused by preoperative radiotherapy for rectal  and evaluate its ability to predict leakage.It was a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (). MRI variables were retrospectively assessed.The study was conducted in the leading center of the trial, which is a tertiary GI hospital.Patients undergoing preoperative chemoradiation with sphincter-preserving surgery were included.Anatomic features were measured by preradiotherapy and postradiotherapy MRI. Univariate analyses were used to identify prognostic factors. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to determine the cutoff value of the changes of MRI variables in predicting leakage.Eighteen (14.4%) of the 125 included patients developed clinical anastomotic leakage. Baseline characteristics were comparable between leakage group and nonleakage group. Relative increments of width of presacral space, thickness of rectal wall, and distal end of sigmoid  discriminate between the  groups better than random chance. Relative increments of width of presacral space was the best performing predictor, with area under the curve of 0.722, sensitivity of 66.7%, specificity of 72.0%, and positive and negative predictive value of 28.6% and 92.8%.The study was limited by its small sample size and retrospective design.Increments of the width of the presacral space, thickness of rectal wall, and distal part of the sigmoid  helps to identify individuals not at risk for clinical anastomotic leakage after rectal  resection. The first variable is the strongest predictor. Changes of these variables should be taken into consideration when evaluating the application of defunctioning stoma.

LAS FUGAS ANASTOMÓTICAS CLÍNICAS DESPUÉS DE LA RESECCIÓN DEL CÁNCER DEL RECTO PUEDEN PREDECIRSE POR LAS CARACTERÍSTICAS ANATÓMICAS PÉLVICAS EN LAS IMAGENES DE RESONANCIA MAGNÉTICA PREOPERATORIA: UN ANÁLISIS SECUNDARIO DE UN ESTUDIO CONTROLADO ALEATORIZADO:: Anteriormente demostramos que la proctitis inducida por la radiación de radioterapia preoperatoria es un factor predisponente para la fuga anastomótica clínica en pacientes sometidos a resección de cáncer rectal. Es necesaria la medición cuantitativa de la proctitis por radiación.Este estudio tuvo como objetivo cuantificar los cambios en las características anatómicas causados por la radioterapia preoperatoria para el cáncer de recto y evaluar su capacidad para predecir las fugas anastomoticas.Fue un análisis secundario de un estudio controlado aleatorio (). Los variables de imagines de resonancia magnetica se evaluaron retrospectivamente.Se llevó a cabo en el centro principal del estudio, que es un hospital gastrointestinal terciario.Se incluyeron pacientes sometidos a quimiorradiación preoperatoria con cirugía conservadora del esfínter.Las características anatómicas se midieron mediante imagines de resonancia magnetica previa y posterior a la radioterapia. Se utilizaron análisis univariados para identificar los factores pronósticos. Las curvas de características operativas del receptor se construyeron para determinar el valor de corte de los cambios de los variables de resonancia magnetica en la predicción de fugas.Dieciocho (14.4%) de los 125 pacientes incluidos desarrollaron fugas anastomóticas clínicas. Las características basales fueron comparables entre el grupo de fugas y el grupo de no fugas. Los incrementos relativos del ancho del espacio presacro, el grosor de la pared rectal y distal del  sigmoide discriminan entre los dos grupos mejor que la posibilidad aleatoria. Los incrementos relativos del ancho del espacio presacro fueron el mejor pronóstico con un AUC de 0.722, sensibilidad del 66.7%, especificidad del 72.0%, valor predictivo positivo y negativo del 28.6% y 92.8%.Estaba limitado por el tamaño de muestra pequeño y el diseño retrospectivo.Los incrementos en el ancho del espacio presacro, el grosor de la pared rectal y la parte distal del  sigmoide ayudan a identificar a las personas que no tienen riesgo de fuga anastomótica clínica después de la resección del cáncer rectal. La primera variable es el predictor más fuerte. Los cambios de estos variables deben tenerse en cuenta al evaluar la aplicación del estoma para desvio.

The development of drug resistance and dearth of the viable drug options form a serious obstacle in the treatment of CC. Herein, the anticancer potential of Zingiberene was examined against the CC cells.The proliferation rate of the CC cells was assessed by cell counting assay. Autophagy was detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The transfected cells were then treated with varied concentrations of Zingiberene (0, 10, 20 and 40 µM) for 24 h and monitored by fluorescent microscopy. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Protein expression was determined by immunoblotting.Zingiberene could considerably inhibit the proliferation of CC cells. The anticancer activity of Zingiberene against the HT-29 CC cells was found to be due to induction of autophagy. The Zingiberene triggered autophagy was also linked with increase in the expression of LC3-II and decrease in p62 expression. However, no apparent effects were observed on the LC3-I expression. Moreover, it was found that zingiberine also caused activation of autophagy-related caspases in the HT-29 cells. Further, it was found that Zingiberene could inhibit the mTOR/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway in the CC cells. Zingiberene also suppressed the weight and volume of the xenografted tumors concentration-dependently.These results indicate that Zingiberene may inhibit the growth of CC in vitro and in vivo and may be used for the development of systemic therapy against CC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620204>Placenta-specific protein 8 promotes the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma PC-9 cells and their tolerance to an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor by activating the ERK signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>Placenta-specific protein 8 (PLAC8) is a conserved protein with a molecular weight of 12.5 kDa. The specific function of this protein has not been fully elucidated, however, PLAC8 has been found to play an important tumor regulatory role in certain types of , including , pancreatic and liver . PLAC8 also participates in the regulation of the cell cycle, autophagy, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and other cellular functions, indicating its potential as a molecular target worth further investigation. The present study investigated the effect of PLAC8 on the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma PC-9 cells and their sensitivity to gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). It was found that the inhibition of PLAC8 expression in PC-9 cells resulted in significantly decreased proliferation, whereas overexpression of PLAC8 significantly increased the proliferation (P<0.05) of PC-9 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of PLAC8 expression resulted in decreased activity of the ERK signaling pathway, while PLAC8 overexpression increased activity of this pathway. Inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway with U0126 reversed the effects induced by inhibiting or overexpressing PLAC8 on cell proliferation. In addition, overexpression of PLAC8 significantly decreased the sensitivity of PC-9 cells to gefitinib, and this effect was reversed by U0126. Overall, these results suggest that PLAC8 is involved in the regulation of proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma PC-9 cells and impacts their sensitivity to an EGFR-TKI. Thus, PLAC8 is a potential novel target in lung adenocarcinoma for future studies.Copyright © 2019, Spandidos Publications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675985>Analysis of the clinical significance of DNA methylation in gastric  based on a genome-wide high-resolution array.</a></h1><p>Aberrant DNA methylation is involved in gastric carcinogenesis and may serve as a useful biomarker in the diagnosis and detection of gastric  (GC) recurrence.A total of 157 patients who received surgery for GC were enrolled in the present study. A genome-wide methylation analysis was performed in tumor and adjacent normal tissues for the discovery set of 16 GC patients; the top three hypermethylated CpG sites of DNA promoters were selected for validation in tissue and plasma samples for the validation set of 141 GC patients. The frequencies of the top three hypermethylated genes in available patient tissues (n = 141) and plasma samples (n = 106) were 41.8% and 38.7%, respectively, for ADAM19; 40.4% and 42.5%, respectively, for FLI1; and 56.7% and 50.9%, respectively, for MSC. In both tissue and plasma samples, FLI1 hypermethylation was associated with more advanced GC and liver and distant lymphatic metastasis, and ADAM19 hypermethylation was associated with more stage IV GC. In plasma samples, MSC hypermethylation was more common in non-superficial type GC than samples without MSC hypermethylation. In both tissue and plasma samples, patients with methylation of all the three genes had significantly more liver metastases, distant lymphatic metastases, and paraaortic lymph node metastases than patients with two or fewer hypermethylated genes. The survival analysis showed that only for stage III GC, patients with hypermethylation of two or three genes had a worse 5-year disease-free survival rate than those with hypermethylation of one or none of the three genes. Subgroup analysis showed that FLI1 hypermethylation in both tissue and plasma samples was associated with liver metastasis in MSI-/EBV- GC, and MSC hypermethylation in tissue samples was correlated with liver metastasis in MSI+ or EBV+ GC. Patients with FLI1 hypermethylation in plasma samples had a significantly worse 5-year disease-free survival rate than those without FLI1 hypermethylation in MSI-/EBV- GC. FLI1 hypermethylation was an independent prognostic factor affecting the overall survival and disease-free survival in both tissue and plasma samples.DNA methylation is a useful biomarker for predicting tumor recurrence patterns and GC patient survival.</p></html>
