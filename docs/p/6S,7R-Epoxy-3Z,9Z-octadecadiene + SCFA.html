<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15537878>Assessing the role of GLUK5 and GLUK6 at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses.</a></h2><p>It has been suggested recently that presynaptic kainate receptors (KARs) are involved in short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. Using genetic deletion and pharmacology, we here assess the role of GLU(K5) and GLU(K6) in synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. We found that the kainate-induced facilitation was completely abolished in the GLU(K6)-/- mice, whereas it was unaffected in the GLU(K5)-/-. Consistent with this finding, synaptic facilitation was reduced in the GLU(K6)(-/-) and was normal in the GLU(K5)-/-. In agreement with these results and ruling out any compensatory effects in the genetic deletion models, application of the GLU(K5)-specific antagonist LY382884 [(3S,4aR,,8aR)-6-(4-carboxyphenyl)methyl-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid] did not affect short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity at the hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. We therefore conclude that the facilitatory effects of kainate on mossy fiber synaptic transmission are mediated by GLU(K6)-containing KARs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9747537>Jasmonate modulates development- and light-regulated alkaloid biosynthesis in Catharanthus roseus.</a></h2><p>Methyl jasmonate, a chemical inducer of secondary metabolism, has been shown to promote vindoline biosynthesis in developing seedlings, as a result of induction of tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) and desacetylvindoline 4-hydroxylase (D4H). The present studies suggest that jasmonate-based induction of TDC and D4H activities involves modulation of transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational controls. The effects of jasmonate on both enzymes were transient with maximum TDC activity appearing 12 h earlier than that of D4H. Jasmonate treatment of etiolated seedlings neither enhanced TDC activity nor could it replace the light requirement for D4H induction. Jasmonate, therefore, appears to modulate events which are already triggered by developmental and environmental specific controls. Salicylic acid, another chemical inducer of secondary metabolism, was ineffective in activating either TDC or D4H under the experimental conditions used.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18603786>Enantioselective synthesis and stereochemical revision of communiols A-C, antibacterial 2,4-disubstituted tetrahydrofurans from the coprophilous fungus Podospora communis.</a></h2><p>The enantioselective synthesis of the originally proposed structure of communiol C, an antibacterial 2,4-disubstituted tetrahydrofuran natural product from the coprophilous fungus Podospora communis, and its epimer via the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation as the source of chirality led us to propose that the genuine stereochemistry of communiol C should be 3R, 5R, and .

Progesterone binding to 4S macromolecule was saturable and co-specific for progestins. Competitors like norgestrel (17beta-hydroxy-18-methyl-19-nor-17alpha-pregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one), 19-norprogesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate (17alpha-acetoxy-6alpha-methylpregn-4-ene-3,20-dione) and compound R(5020) (17,21-dimethyl-19-norpregna-4,9-diene-3,20-dione) possessed higher binding affinities for the progestin receptor. The dissociation constant (K(d)) for the progesterone-receptor interaction was 0.6-1.6nm and the receptor concentration ranged between 6600 and 8200 sites/cell. Norethindrone and norethindrone acetate competed for the progesterone receptor with inhibition constants (K(i)) of 6.8 and 72nm respectively. Gradient displacement and competitive-receptor assays indicated that norethindrone acetate-binding affinity for progestin receptor was approximately one-tenth that of norethindrone and progesterone. The progestins also inhibited oestradiol binding to 4. oestrogenic receptor by 8-12%, involving interaction at the oestradiol-binding site with a calculated K(i) value of 0.5-0.8mum. The competitive interaction of progestins with steroid receptors may be of putative importance in explaining the progestin action at the target site.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17081039>Thiopyran route to polypropionates: an efficient synthesis of serricornin.</a></h2><p>The synthesis of serricornin [(4S,,7S)-7-hydroxy-4,6-dimethylnonan-3-one], a sex pheromone produced by the female cigarette beetle (Lasioderma serricorne F.), in seven steps from readily available racemic 1,4-dioxa-8-thiaspiro[4.5]decane-6-carboxaldehyde (6) is described.

In this study, we tested the attraction of males to the acetates of three analogs of diprionol, each missing one methyl group, viz. (2S,7S)-7-methyl-2-pentadecanol, (2S,)-2,6-dimethyl-1-tetradecanol, and (2S,3S)-3-methyl-2-pentadecanol. None of the analogs alone, or in combination with diprionol acetate, was attractive in Sweden, even at 100 times the amount of diprionol acetate attractive to N. sertifer. In Japan, the acetate of (2S,3S)-3-methyl-2-pentadecanol attracted males when tested in amounts 10-20 times higher than the acetate pheromone component. The acetate esters of the (2S,3R)-analog and the (2S,3R,7R)-isomer of diprionol also were tested in combination with the pheromone compound (acetate ester). Both compounds caused an almost total trap-catch reduction in Sweden, whereas in Japan they appear to have relatively little effect on trap capture when added to diprionol acetate. Butyrate and iso-butyrate esters of diprionol were unattractive to N. sertifer in Sweden. In summary, there exists geographic variation in N. sertifer in responses to both diprionyl acetate and some of its analogs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17824659>The thiopyran route to polypropionates: enantioselective synthesis of membrenone B from racemic fragments.</a></h2><p>(,7S,8S,9R,10S)-(--)-Membrenone B was synthesized in nine steps (9.4% overall yield) beginning with two-directional aldol coupling of tetrahydro-4H-thiopyran-4-one with racemic 1,4-dioxa-8-thiaspiro[4.5]decane-6-carboxaldehyde. The first aldol reaction occurs with dynamic kinetic resolution to give a single adduct (>98% ee).

The size of BBP was found to be 7., while it was converted to subunits of 45,000--48,000 dalton by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate. The dissociation constant of the binding of BBP with butyrate was 2.22 X 10(-6) M in the standard assay. 30-Fold purification of BBP was achieved by batch-wise adsorption and elution from CM-cellulose and hydroxylapatite column chromatography.

Additionally, caprolactones are important feedstocks with diverse applications in the polymer industry and new non-native terpenone-derived biocatalytic caprolactone syntheses are thus of potential value for industrial biocatalytic materials applications. Biocatalytic reduction of synthetic analogues of R-(-)-carvone with additional substituents at C3 or C6, or both C3 and C6, using three types of OYEs (OYE2, PETNR and OYE3) shows significant impact of both regio-substitution and the substrate diastereomer. Bioreduction of (-)-carvone derivatives substituted with a Me and/or OH group at C6 is highly dependent on the diastereomer of the substrate. Derivatives bearing C6 substituents larger than methyl moieties are not substrates. Computer docking studies of PETNR with both ()-Me and (6R)-Me substituted (-)-carvone provides a model consistent with the outcomes of bioconversion. The products of bioreduction were efficiently biotransformed by the Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (BVase) CHMO_Phi1 to afford novel trisubstituted lactones with complete regioselectivity to provide a new biocatalytic entry to these chiral caprolactones. This provides both new non-native polymerization feedstock chemicals, but also with enhanced efficiency and selectivity over native (+)-dihydrocarvone Baeyer-Villigerase expansion. Optimum enzymatic reactions were scaled up to 60-100 mg, demonstrating the utility for preparative biocatalytic synthesis of both new synthetic scaffold-modified dihydrocarvones and efficient biocatalytic entry to new chiral caprolactones, which are potential single-isomer chiral polymer feedstocks.© 2019 The Authors.

The first synthesis of such a precursor was achieved in an efficient and fully enantioselective manner using a thiopyran-based strategy for polypropionate synthesis. This putative precursor, a complex mixture of ring-chain and keto-enol tautomers, was kinetically stable and isomerized exceedingly slowly to the thermodynamically more stable siphonarin B. In the presence of imidazole, the mixture reached apparent equilibrium within several hours giving siphonarin B as the predominant component (ca. 70%), thereby constituting its enantioselective total synthesis. In the presence of alumina, both siphonarin B and the dihydroxytetraone precursor underwent retro-Claisen rearrangements (via a hemiacetal tautomer) to give baconipyrones A and C among other products. This is the first total synthesis of baconipyrone A and "biomimetic" synthesis of baconipyrone C. Control experiments suggested that baconipyrone A was produced in an unprecedented cascade process where the intermediate enol(ate) of the retro-Claisen rearrangement was directly engaged in aldol cyclization while baconipyrone C resulted from simple ketonization of the enol(ate). These experiments provide the first unambiguous demonstration that the baconipyrones are plausible isolation artifacts and suggest they are most likely derived from siphonarins rather than an "acyclic" precursor. Caloundrin B was not detected among the products from any of the isomerization experiments, suggesting the possibility that it is an unstable biosynthetic product.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1245185>Stereochemistry of a methyl-group rearrangement during the biosynthesis of lanosterol.</a></h2><p>1.

Each mevalonate was converted into cholesterol by a rat liver preparation. 3. Each cholesterol specimen was converted into androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione by incubation with Mycobacterium phlei in the presence of 2,2'.dipyridyl. Each specimen of androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione was converted into androsta-1,4-dien-3-one-17-ethylene ketail. 4. The samples of androsta-1,4-dien-3-one-17-ethylene ketal were each converted chemically into oestrones in which the methyl group at C-18 is the only carbon atom that originated from C-6 in mevalonolactone. 5. The oestrone from (3RS)-[6-3H1,6-14C]mevalonolactone was oxidised chemically to acetic acid which was converted into p-bromophenacyl acetate and the 3H/14C ratio was measured. 6. There was no overall loss of tritium from the methyl group of acetic acid, as measured by determining the 3H/14C ratios of the p-bromophenacyl esters, when the synthetic and degradative procedures 1 -- 5 were tested with [3H1,2-14C]acetic acid. 7. The oestrones derived from the 6R and -mevalonolactones were oxidised. The chiralities of the resulting acetates were determined by an established procedure whereby the acetates were converted into 2S-malates which were examined for loss of tritium on equilibration with fumarate hydratase. 8. The oestrone from (3RS,6R)-[6-2H1,6-3H1,6-14C]mevalonate gave acetic acid which was converted into 2S-malate that retained 68.6% of its tritium after treatment with fumarate hydratase; the configuration of this acetic acid was R. 9. The oestrone from (3RS,)-E16-2H1,6-3H1,6-14C]mevalonate was oxidised to acetic acid which was converted into 2S-malate that retained 31.9% of its tritium after treatment with fumarate hydratase; the configuration of this acetic acid was S. 10. There was no overall change in the configuration of a chiral methyl group between C-6 of mevalonate and C-18 of oestrone. It is cncluded that the intramolecular migration of a chiral methyl group from C-15 in 2,3-oxidosqualene to C-13 in lanosterol is stereospecific and occurs with overall retention of configuration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5919904>Evidence that the granular and fibrillar components of nucleoli contain 28 and  RNA, respectively.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18997951>A diastereoselective route to 2,6-syn-disubstituted tetrahydropyrans: synthesis of the civet compound (+)-2-((2S,)-6-methyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl) acetic acid.</a></h2><p>A diastereoselective synthesis of 2,6-syn-disubstituted tetrahydropyrans has been developed based on the ability of furanyl-ether chiral centres to epimerise readily under acidic conditions.

Hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and gel-permeation chromatography were conducted to identify the structure of -PCL-PEG. The biocompatibility of the -PCL-PEG was evaluated by a cell counting kit-8 assay. Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by a water-in-oil-in-water double emulsion (W/O/W) solvent evaporation method. The size distribution and zeta potential of NPs were determined by dynamic light scattering. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the morphology of NPs. Drug-loading capacity, encapsulation efficiency, and the release behavior of ovalbumin (OVA)-loading NPs were tested by the bicinchoninic acid assay kit.

Subtilisin Carlsberg protease and bovine cholesterol esterase both showed high enantioselectivity in this process, but favored opposite enantiomers. Subtilisin Carlsberg favored esters of (1S,5S,)-1, while bovine cholesterol esterase favored esters of (1R,5R,6R)-1, consistent with the approximately mirror-image arrangement of the active sites of subtilisins and lipases/esterases. A gram-scale resolution of 1-acrylate with subtilisin Carlsberg yielded (1S,5S,)-1 (1.1 g, 46 % yield, 99 % ee) and (1R,5R,6R)-1-acrylate (1.3 g, 44 % yield, 99 % ee) although the reaction was slow. The high enantioselectivity combined with the conformational rigidity of the substrate made this an ideal example to identify the molecular basis of the enantioselectivity of subtilisin Carlsberg toward secondary alcohols. When modeled, the favored (1S,5S,) enantiomer adopted a catalytically productive conformation with two longer-than-expected hydrogen bonds, consistent with the slow reaction rate.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicate that HDAC inhibitors act on the FR-beta gene by enhancing RAR-associated histone acetylation to increase the association of Sp1 with the basal FR-beta promoter. Under these conditions, the expression level of Sp1 is unaltered. A decreased availability of putative repressor AP-1 proteins may also indirectly contribute to the effect of HDAC inhibitors. Finally, FR-beta selectively mediated growth inhibition by () dideazatetrahydrofolate in a manner that was greatly potentiated in AML cells by ATRA and HDAC inhibition. Therefore, the combination of ATRA and innocuous HDAC inhibitors may be expected to facilitate selective FR-beta-targeted therapies in AML.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14671382>A comparison of the ring conformational properties of two derivatives prepared from the same diene diacetate precursor.</a></h2><p>Results of single-crystal X-ray experiments performed for the title compounds, (1S,2R,3S,4R,5R)-4-benzyloxy-2-[1-(benzyloxy)allyl]-5-hydroxymethyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydrofuran-3-ol, C(22)H(26)O(5), (I), and (3R,5S,,7S,8S)-3,6-bis(benzyloxy)-5-iodomethyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]furan-2-one, C(21)H(21)IO(5), (II), demonstrate that the tetrahydrofuran ring that is common to both structures adopts a different conformation in each molecule. Structural analyses of (I) and (II), which were prepared from the same precursor, indicate that their different conformations are caused by hydrogen-bonding interactions in the case of (I) and the presence of a fused bicyclic ring system in the case of (II). Density functional theory calculations on simplified analogs of (I) and (II) are also presented.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15345660>Mechanism of the drug interaction between valproic acid and carbapenem antibiotics in monkeys and rats.</a></h2><p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare, Japan banned coadministration of carbapenems, such as panipenem/betamipron (PAPM), meropenem (MEPM), and valproic acid (VPA) because clinical reports have indicated that the coadministration caused seizures in epileptic patients due to lowered plasma levels of VPA. In this study, we have clarified the mechanism of the drug-drug interaction using PAPM, MEPM, and doripenem [S-4661; (+)-(4R,5S,)-6-[(1R)-1-hydroxyethyl]-4-methyl-7-oxo-3-[[(3S,5S)-5-[(sulfamoylamino)methyl]-3-pyrrolidinyl]thio]-1-azabicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-ene-2-caboxylic acid monohydrate], a newly synthesized carbapenem. In vitro experiments using monkey liver slices suggested that the apparent synthetic rate of VPA glucuronide (VPA-G) increased in the presence of carbapenems. However, no such increase was observed in the experiment using monkey liver microsomes. Although no increase of uridine 5'-diphosphate D-glucuronic acid was found in monkey liver slices in the presence of carbapenems, potent inhibitory activity of carbapenems for the hydrolysis of VPA-G was found in monkey and rat liver homogenate. In vivo hydrolysis of VPA-G was clearly shown by the existence of VPA in plasma after dosing of VPA-G to rats, and its inhibition by carbapenems was also clearly shown by the negligible levels of VPA in rat plasma after coadministration of carbapenems and VPA-G. These results clearly indicate one of the important causes of drug interaction as follows: carbapenems would inhibit the hydrolytic enzyme, which is involved in the hydrolysis of VPA-G to VPA, resulting in a decrease of plasma concentration of VPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15275825>Characterisation of the effects of ATPA, a GLU(K5) kainate receptor agonist, on GABAergic synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices.</a></h2><p>Kainate receptors are implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological processes in the CNS. Previously we demonstrated that (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butylisoxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid (ATPA), a selective agonist for the GLU(K5) subtype of kainate receptor, depresses monosynaptically evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. In the current study, we provide a more detailed characterisation of this effect. Firstly, our data demonstrate a rank order of potency of domoate>kainate>ATPA>alpha-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxalolyl)propionic acid Secondly, we confirm that the effects of ATPA are not mediated indirectly via the activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors (i.e. either GABA(A) or GABA(B)). Thirdly, we show that the small increase in conductance induced by ATPA is insufficient to account for the depression of monosynaptic inhibition. Fourthly, we show that the effects of ATPA on IPSPs are antagonised by the GLU(K5)-selective antagonist (3S, 4aR, , 8aR)-6-(4-carboxyphenyl)methyl-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (LY382884). However, LY382884 is less potent as an antagonist of the effects of ATPA on IPSPs compared to its depressant effect on EPSPs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16549226>Absence of convulsive liability of doripenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic, in comparison with beta-lactam antibiotics.</a></h2><p>beta-Lactam antibiotics have been suggested to have some degree of convulsive activity and neurotoxicity in experimental animals as well as in clinical situations. We examined the convulsive activities of a new carbapenem antibiotic, (+)-(4R,5S,)-6-[(1R)-1-hydroxyethyl]-4-methyl-7-oxo-3-[[(3S,5S)-5-[(sulfamoylamino)methyl]-3-pyrrolidinyl]thio]-1-azabicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-ene-2-carboxic acid monohydrate (doripenem) using several animals and compared them with beta-lactam antibiotics. In intravenous (IV) injection studies, imipenem/cilastatin, at 400/400mg/kg produced seizure discharges on electroencephalogram (EEG) accompanied with clonic convulsions in rats. Meropenem showed only wet dog shaking behavior at 200 and 400mg/kg. Doripenem caused no changes in the EEG and behavior in rats at 400mg/kg. Imipenem/cilastatin IV potentiated the pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced convulsions in mice at 250/250 mg/kg, while meropenem, panipenem/betamipron, cefazolin or doripenem did not cause any marked effects at up to 500 mg/kg. In mouse intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection studies, imipenem, panipenem and cefazolin induced clonic convulsions in a dose-dependent manner in mice. Doripenem and meropenem did not induce convulsions at up to 100 microg/mouse. In dog ICV injection studies, imipenem produced generalized seizure discharge with clonic convulsions at 100 microg/dog. Meropenem also produced spikes or seizure discharges at 100, 300 and 1,000 microg/dog. However, doripenem had no effects on the EEG and behavior in dogs at any doses. In in vitro binding studies, imipenem, panipenem, cefazolin and meropenem inhibited [(3)H]muscimol binding to the GABA(A) receptor in mouse brain homogenates while doripenem did not cause any inhibition at up to 10mM. In addition, doripenem had no influence on the anti-convulsant actions of valproic acid in the PTZ- or bicuculine-induced convulsive model. These results clearly indicate that doripenem has no convulsive activity, suggesting that its neurotoxicity may be negligible in clinical use.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24299206>The Clostridium small RNome that responds to stress: the paradigm and importance of toxic metabolite stress in C. acetobutylicum.</a></h2><p>Small non-coding RNAs (sRNA) are emerging as major components of the cell's regulatory network, several possessing their own regulons. A few sRNAs have been reported as being involved in general or toxic-metabolite stress, mostly in Gram- prokaryotes, but hardly any in Gram+ prokaryotes. Significantly, the role of sRNAs in the stress response remains poorly understood at the genome-scale level. It was previously shown that toxic-metabolite stress is one of the most comprehensive and encompassing stress responses in the cell, engaging both the general stress (or heat-shock protein, HSP) response as well as specialized metabolic programs.Using RNA deep sequencing (RNA-seq) we examined the sRNome of C. acetobutylicum in response to the native but toxic metabolites, butanol and butyrate. 7.5% of the RNA-seq reads mapped to genome outside annotated ORFs, thus demonstrating the richness and importance of the small RNome. We used comparative expression analysis of 113 sRNAs we had previously computationally predicted, and of annotated mRNAs to set metrics for reliably identifying sRNAs from RNA-seq data, thus discovering 46 additional sRNAs. Under metabolite stress, these 159 sRNAs displayed distinct expression patterns, a select number of which was verified by Northern analysis. We identified stress-related expression of sRNAs affecting transcriptional (, S-box &solB) and translational (tmRNA & SRP-RNA) processes, and 65 likely targets of the RNA chaperone Hfq.Our results support an important role for sRNAs for understanding the complexity of the regulatory network that underlies the stress response in Clostridium organisms, whether related to normophysiology, pathogenesis or biotechnological applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/476077>Biosynthesis of slaframine, (1S,,8aS)-1-acetoxy-6-aminooctahydroindolizine, a parasympathomimetic alkaloid of fungal origin. 3. Origin of the pyrrolidine ring.</a></h2><p>The phytopathogen Rhizoctonia leguminicola has previously been shown to incorporate pipecolic acid into the piperidine alkaloids 1-acetoxy-6-aminooctahydroindolizine (slaframine) and 3,4,5-trihydroxyoctahydro-1-pyrindine. In the experiments described here, resting cultures of R. leguminicola were incubated with [1-14C]- and [2-14C]malonic acid and with [1-14C]- and [2-2H]acetic acid. Both  were incorporated into the ring systems of both alkaloids. Mass spectrometric analysis of 2H-enriched slaframine showed that the label resides in the five-membered ring and that the methyl carbon of acetate is joined to the carboxyl carbon of pipecolate. A pipecolate-dependent decarboxylation of [1-14C]malonate was demonstrated in cell-free extracts of R. leguminicola. The results account for previously unattributed carbons in the two alkaloids and suggest the formation of an eight-carbon intermediate common to both alkaloids by acylation of malonate with pipecolic acid.</p></html>
