The effects of several unsaturated fatty acids on cardiometabolic health, such as eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) docosahexaenoic  (DHA), α linolenic  (ALA), linoleic  (LA), and  (OA) have received much attention in past years. In addition, results from recent studies revealed that several other uncommon fatty acids (fatty acids present at a low content or else not contained in usual foods), such as furan fatty acids, -3 docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and conjugated fatty acids, also have favorable effects on cardiometabolic health. In the present report, we searched the literature in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to review the research progress on anti-CVD effect of these uncommon fatty acids. DPA has a favorable effect on cardiometabolic health in a different way to other long-chain -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC -3 PUFAs), such as EPA and DHA. Furan fatty acids and conjugated linolenic  (CLNA) may be potential bioactive fatty acids beneficial for cardiometabolic health, but evidence from intervention studies in humans is still limited, and well-designed clinical trials are required. The favorable effects of conjugated linoleic  (CLA) on cardiometabolic health observed in animal or in vitro cannot be replicated in humans. However, most intervention studies in humans concerning CLA have only evaluated its effect on cardiometabolic risk factors but not its direct effect on risk of CVD, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will be required to clarify this point. However, several difficulties and limitations exist for conducting RCTs to evaluate the effect of these fatty acids on cardiometabolic health, especially the high costs for purifying the fatty acids from natural sources. This review provides a basis for better nutritional prevention and therapy of CVD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28448873>Osthole attenuates lipid accumulation, regulates the expression of inflammatory mediators, and increases antioxidants in FL83B cells.</a></h2><p>Osthole is found in Cnidium monnieri (L.) and has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. It also inhibits the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This study aimed to evaluate the osthole suppressive nonalcoholic fatty liver disease effects in  (OA)-induced hepatic steatosis and if it can modulate inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. FL83B cells were pretreated with OA (250μΜ) for 24h, and then added different concentrations of osthole (3-100μM) for 24h. Subsequently, lipolysis and transcription factors of adipogenesis and phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase proteins were measured. In addition, cells with OA-induced steatosis were HO-stimulated, and then incubated with osthole to evaluated if it could suppress its progression to steatohepatitis. Osthole significantly enhanced glycerol release and lipolysis protein expression. Osthole also promoted phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinases and increased the activity of triglyceride lipase and hormone- sensitive lipase. Osthole suppressed the nuclear transcription factor kappa-B and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and decreased the malondialdehyde concentration in FL83B cells with OA-induced steatosis that were treated with HO. These results suggest that osthole might suppress nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by decreasing lipid accumulation, and through its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects via blocked NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Fisetin has also been demonstrated to have anti-obesity properties in mice. However, the effect of fisetin on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is still elusive. Thus, the present study evaluated whether fisetin improves hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice and regulates lipid metabolism of FL83B hepatocytes in vitro.NAFLD was induced by HFD in male C57BL/6 mice. The mice were then injected intraperitoneally with fisetin for 10 weeks. In another experiment, FL83B cells were challenged with  to induce lipid accumulation and treated with various concentrations of fisetin.NAFLD mice treated with fisetin had decreased body weight and epididymal adipose tissue weight compared to NAFLD mice. Fisetin treatment also reduced liver lipid droplet and hepatocyte steatosis, alleviated serum free fatty , and leptin concentrations, significantly decreased fatty  synthase, and significantly increased phosphorylation of AMPKα and the production of sirt-1 and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I in the liver tissue. In vitro, fisetin decreased lipid accumulation and increased lipolysis and β-oxidation in hepatocytes.This study suggests that fisetin is a potential novel treatment for alleviating hepatic lipid metabolism and improving NAFLD in mice via activation of the sirt1/AMPK and β-oxidation pathway.© 2018 The Author(s).

The main objective of this research is the screening of polyunsaturated fatty  producing fungi from soil samples of mangrove from the seashore coastal areas in India. Fusarium verticillioides species showed the presence of saturated and unsaturated fatty  in the starch yeast-extract medium. Among the representative isolate, F. verticillioides NKF1 was found to grow in a YEP broth medium and produce the maximum lipid. The gas chromatography was used to identify the fatty acids present in fungal strain. Saturated fatty  such as palmitic  (C16:0) 0.14/100 g, stearic  (C18:0) 0.09/100 g, and monounsaturated fatty  such as  (C18:1) 0.08/100 g and polyunsaturated fatty  such as linolenic  (C18:3ω3) 0.08/100 g were present in significant amount in the fungal strain. Fungal strain F. verticillioides NKF1 was characterized by SEM and molecular characterization by 18S rRNA. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences were analyzed by 18S rRNA and ITS4 sequences of related fungi were sequenced, and then the data were compared with NCBI database. This newly isolated F. verticillioides NKF1 was found to be a promising culture for the development of an economical method for commercial production of linolenic  (ω-3 fatty ).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27756518>Intracellular and extracellular miRNome deregulation in cellular models of NAFLD or NASH: Clinical implications.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents the most common chronic liver disease in industrialized countries. NAFLD has the potential to progress through the inflammatory phase of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Identifying patients at risk for this transition is a relevant clinical challenge. The complexity of these phenotypes in vivo made necessary the development of in vitro models in order to dissect the molecular signalling affected in NAFLD and NASH, but also to identify potential circulating biomarkers.We profiled the expression of 754 cellular and medium-secreted human miRNAs in HepG2 cells after lipotoxic (Palmitate, model of NASH) or not-lipotoxic stimuli (Oleate-Palmitate, model of NAFLD). Results were validated through Single TaqMan assays. We performed computational analysis of miRNA targets and pathways. Oleate-palmitate treatment induced a variation of 2.8% and 10% of total miRNAs in cells and medium, respectively; palmitate treatment caused 10% and 19% intracellular and extracellular miRNA deregulation, respectively. We validated miR-126, miR-150, miR-223, miR-483-3p, miR-1226*, and miR-1290 deregulation. Through computational analysis, we observed that targets of both intracellular and extracellular DE miRNAs were involved in processes associated with the onset and progression of NAFLD and NASH, such as fatty  metabolism, apoptosis and .These data would be useful to elucidate the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis and progression of the NAFLD spectrum, but they also allow the identification of novel potential biomarkers for differential diagnosis to be tested in vivo.Copyright Â© 2016 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

During the development of obesity and NAFLD, mitochondria adapt to the increased lipid load in hepatocytes by increasing the rate of fatty  oxidation. In concert with this, reactive species (RS) generation is increased, damaging hepatocytes and inducing . Hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction is central to the pathogenesis of NAFLD via undefined mechanisms. There are no FDA approved treatments for NAFLD other than weight loss and management of glucose tolerance. Electrophilic nitro- (NO-OA) displays anti-inflammatory and antioxidant signaling actions, thus mitochondrial dysfunction, RS production and inflammatory responses to NO-OA and the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone were evaluated in a murine model of insulin resistance and NAFLD. Mice on HFD for 20 wk displayed increased adiposity, insulin resistance and hepatic lipid accumulation (steatosis) compared to mice on normal chow (NC). The HFD mice had mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by lower hepatic mitochondrial complex I, IV and V activity compared to mice on NC. Treatment with NO-OA or rosiglitazone for the last 42 days (out of 20 wk) abrogated HFD-mediated decreases in hepatic mitochondrial complex I, IV and V activity. Notably, NO-OA treatment normalized hepatic triglyceride levels and significantly reversed hepatic steatosis. Despite the improved glucose tolerance observed upon rosiglitazone treatment, liver weight and hepatic triglycerides were significantly increased over vehicle-treated HFD mice. These observations support that the pleiotropic signaling actions of electrophilic fatty acids limit the complex hepatic and systemic pathogenic responses instigated by obesity, without the adverse effects of thiazolidinedione drugs such as rosiglitazone.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

To address this problem, the oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, , apoptosis and their mediator molecules have been investigated in the insulin releasing beta cells exposed to palmitic and/or . Herein, we have demonstrated that in cultured 1.1B4 beta cells  promotes neutral lipid accumulation and insulin secretion, whereas palmitic  is poorly incorporated into triglyceride and it does not stimulate insulin secretion from human pancreatic islets at physiologically glucose concentrations. In addition, palmitic  caused:  oxidative stress through a mechanism involving increases in ROS production and MMP-2 protein expression/gelatinolytic activity associated with down-regulation of SOD2 protein;  endoplasmic reticulum stress by up-regulation of chaperone BiP protein and unfolded protein response (UPR) transcription factors (eIF2α, ATF6, XBP1u proteins) and by PTP-1B down-regulation in both mRNA and protein levels;   through enhanced synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines (IL6, IL8 proteins); and  apoptosis by enforced proteic expression of CHOP multifunctional transcription factor.  alone had opposite effects due to its different capacity of controlling these metabolic pathways, in particular by reduction of the ROS levels and MMP-2 activity, down-regulation of BiP, eIF2α, ATF6, XBP1u, CHOP, IL6, IL8 and by SOD2 and PTP-1B overexpression. The supplementation of saturated palmitic  with the monounsaturated  reversed the negative effects of palmitic  alone regulating insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells through ROS, MMP-2, ATF6, XBP1u, IL8 reduction and SOD2, PTP-1B activation.

The differences of fatty acids transfer in lipoproteins of herbivorous and carnivorous animals.]</a></h2><p>According phylogenetic theory of general pathology, overconsumption of meat food by herbivorous animals always results in atherosclerosis and atheromatosis of intima of arteries. The etiological factors of atherosclerosis, atheromatosis in vivo: a) absorption by cells of polyene fatty acids in anoB-100 lipoproteins of low density; b) impossibility of converting exogenous palmitic saturated fatty acids into mono-unsaturated  fatty ; c) monocytes-macrophages in intima inactively hydrolyze polyene fatty acids esterified by alcohol cholesterol. The disorder of biological function of trophology (nutrition), biological reaction of exotrophy (external nutrition) and aphysiologically high content of palmitic unsaturated fatty acids and alcohol cholesterol in food become a pathogenic factors. The key stage of pathogenesis is formation in blood of non-ligand palmitic lipoproteins of very low density. At that: a) how to utilize in vivo non-ligand palmitic lipoproteins of very low density; it is possible under activation of biological function of endoecology, biological reaction of , formation of atheromatosis of intima of arteries and b) how to prolong function to cells at impossibility of of absorbing from inter-cellular medium polyene fatty acids; this is a foundation of atherosclerosis, disorders of biological function of adaptation, biological reaction of compensation. The primary prevention of myocardium infarction requires elimination of consumption of surplus amount of animal food. At low content of palmitic saturated fatty acids in food insulin forms optimal  alternative of metabolism of fatty acids supporting high "kinetic parameters" of organism and effective synthesis of ATP. According single pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and atheromatosis it is necessary to prevent development of non-ligand palmitic lipoproteins of very low density in blood. Without them no development of both atherosclerosis and atheromatosis is possible.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30028518>Multi-omics analysis points to altered platelet functions in severe food-associated respiratory allergy.</a></h2><p>Prevalence and severity of allergic diseases have increased worldwide.

Profilin sensitization constitutes a good model to study the progression of allergic . Our aim was to identify the underlying mechanisms and the associated biomarkers of this progression, focusing on severe phenotypes, using transcriptomics and metabolomics.Twenty-five subjects were included in the study. Plasma samples were analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS and LC-MS, respectively). Individuals were classified in four groups-"nonallergic," "mild," "moderate," and "severe"-based on their clinical history, their response to an oral challenge test with profilin, and after a refinement using a mathematical metabolomic model. PBMCs were used for microarray analysis.We found a set of transcripts and metabolites that were specific for the "severe" phenotype. By metabolomics, a decrease in carbohydrates and pyruvate and an increase in lactate were detected, suggesting aerobic glycolysis. Other metabolites were incremented in "severe" group: lysophospholipids, sphingosine-1-phosphate, sphinganine-1-phosphate, and lauric, myristic, palmitic, and  fatty acids. On the other hand, carnitines were decreased along severity. Significant transcripts in the "severe" group were found to be downregulated and were associated with platelet functions, protein synthesis, histone modification, and fatty  metabolism.We have found evidence that points to the association of severe allergic  with platelet functions alteration, together with reduced protein synthesis, and switch of immune cells to aerobic glycolysis.© 2018 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Results showed that HepG2 cells co-cultured with FFA exhibited lipid infiltration and were susceptible to apoptosis upon exposure to the CCl4 solution. The expression of molecules related to apoptosis (Caspases, Bcl-2/Bax) and ER stress (GRP78, IRE1, ATF6, PERK, et al.) was all significantly decreased upon RSV treatment. We further inhibited GRP78 by siRNA, results showed that the anti-apoptotic effect of RSV still maintained under GRP78 siRNA condition.

However, the precise mechanism underlying the proatherogenic effect of TFA has not been completely elucidated. To obtain better understanding of the impact of TFA on vascular diseases, this study investigated the effect of TFA on oxidative stress using a mouse model of atherosclerosis.Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor knockout mice were fed with diet containing 0.5% cholesterol (control), 0.5% cholesterol+5% elaidic acids (Trans group), and 0.5% cholesterol+5%  acids (Cis group) for 8 weeks. Atherosclerotic lesion and oxidative stress in aortic wall were evaluated. In vitro experiments using smooth muscle cells were performed to corroborate in vivo findings.The atherosclerotic lesion area was significantly larger in Trans group than that in control or Cis group. Lipoprotein fractionation was similar among groups, while plasma oxidized LDL level and superoxide production in the vessel wall were markedly increased in Trans group. Elaidic acids were accumulated in a variety of tissues including liver and adipose tissue, which was associated with the high level of inflammatory cytokines in these tissues and plasma. Aortic wall from Trans group showed augmented expression of reactive oxygen species and NAPDH oxidase (p22phox) in smooth muscle cells. In vitro experiments confirmed that elaidic acids upregulated expression of NADPH oxidase and inflammatory cytokines in cultured smooth muscle cells.Excessive intake of TFA contributes to the progression of atherosclerosis by evoking  and oxidative stress in mice.Copyright © 2017 Japanese College of Cardiology.

The aim of this study was to develop liquid crystalline systems for topical administration of curcumin for the treatment of . These liquid crystalline systems were developed from , polyoxypropylene (5) polyoxyethylene (20) cetyl alcohol, and water as the surfactant, oil phase, and aqueous phase, respectively. These systems were characterized, and polarized light microscopy showed anisotropy with lamellar mesophases (Formulation 1) and hexagonal mesophases (Formulations 2 and 3), which were confirmed by the peak ratio measured using small-angle X-ray scattering. In addition, rheological tests revealed that the formulations exhibited gel-like behavior (G'>G″), as evidenced by the increased G' values that indicate structured systems. Texture profile analysis showed that hexagonal mesophases have high values of hardness, adhesiveness, and compressibility, which indicate structured systems. In vitro studies on bioadhesion revealed that the hexagonal mesophases increased the bioadhesiveness of the systems to the skin of the pig ear. An in vivo  experiment showed that the curcumin-loaded hexagonal mesophase exhibited an anti-inflammatory activity as compared to the positive control (dexamethasone). The results suggest that this system has a potential to be used as a bioadhesive vehicle for the topical administration of curcumin. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that these systems can be used for the optimization of drug delivery systems to the skin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29788899>Topical Nanostructured Lipid Carrier Based Hydrogel of Mometasone Furoate for the Treatment of Psoriasis.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate nanostructured lipid carrier based topical hydrogel of mometasone furoate for the treatment of psoriasis.Drug loaded NLCs were successfully developed by microemulsion technique. Pseudo ternary phase diagrams were constructed using different combinations of surfactant and co-surfactants to study the microemulsion existence range. Different compositions were selected from the phase diagram showing maximum microemulsion region and were converted into NLCs by dilution in water (1:20).

Transmission electron microscopy confirmed spherical shape of nanostructured lipid carrier. Carbopol 940 was used to convert NLC dispersion into NLC based hydrogel to improve its viscosity for topical administration. Drug permeation studies showed prolonged drug release from the NLC based gel as compared to marketed formulation following Higuchi release kinetics.

The current study demonstrated the anti‑proliferation and pro‑apoptosis activities of ximenynic  by cell viability assay and flow cytometry analysis. The expression of anti‑apoptosis protein silent information regulator T1 (SIRT1) was significantly suppressed by ximenynic . Furthermore, ximenynic  blocked G1/S phase transition by inhibiting the protein expression of the cell cycle‑associated protein general control of amino  synthesis yeast homolog like 2 (GCN5L2), and the mRNA expression of cyclin D3 and cyclin E1. Furthermore, ximenynic  suppressed the expression of angiogenesis‑associated genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)‑B and VEGF‑C. Finally, ximenynic  significantly inhibited the expression of cyclooxygenase‑1 (COX‑1) mRNA and protein, however COX‑2 expression was not reduced. The results of the present study suggested that ximenynic  may inhibit growth of HepG2 cells by selective inhibition of COX‑1 expression, which leads to cell cycle arrest, and alters the apoptosis pathway and expression of angiogenic factors.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-asthmatic potential of HD in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mouse model of allergic asthma. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory potential of HD was examined to identify a plausible mechanism of action of HD in vitro. HD strongly reduced goblet cell hyperplasia, eosinophil infiltration, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which reduced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), , and the expression of Th2 cytokines (IL-5 and IL-13) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The expression of IL-5, IL-4, eotaxin-2, lysyl oxidase-like 2 (loxl2), and GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA-3) was attenuated in the lungs. In an in vitro assay, HD exerted immunomodulatory effects through the suppression of Th2 cytokines (IL-5, IL-13), IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production through downregulation of GATA-3 expression in EL-4 T cells. These findings suggest that the anti-asthmatic activity of HD may occur through the suppression of Th2 cytokines and total Immunoglobulin E (IgE) production by inhibition of the GATA-3 transcription pathway.

In other words, is it better to cut fat or cut carbohydrate for weight loss. However, going beyond this debate (fat versus carbohydrate), are questions around whether certain fatty acids are worse for promoting insulin resistance, , and obesity. The overall evidence in the literature suggests that medium-chain saturated fats (such as lauric , found in coconut oil) and monounsaturated fat (, found in olive oil) are less likely to promote insulin resistance, , and fat storage compared to long-chain saturated fatty acids (such as stearic  found in large quantities in butter, but particularly palmitic  found in palm oil) especially when consumed on top of a diet moderate in refined carbohydrates. Compared to long-chain saturated fats, lauric  and  have an increased fatty  oxidation rate, are more likely to be burned for energy and less likely to be stored in adipose tissue, and thus promote increased energy expenditure. Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as linoleic , as found in vegetable oils may contribute to obesity, whereas omega-3 PUFA may be protective.

In this study we investigated whether fucoxanthin could inhibit lipids accumulation in FL83B hepatocytes. FL83B cells were induced as fatty liver cell model by 0.5 mM  for 48 h, and treated with various concentration of fucoxanthin for 24 h. The results demonstrated that fucoxanthin significantly suppressed lipid accumulation and decreased lipid peroxidation in hepatocytes. Fucoxanthin could decrease lipogenesis-related transcription factor expression, including sterol regulatory element-binding proteins 1c and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. It also reduced fatty  synthase expression and increased adipose triglyceride lipase and the phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase production for lipolysis. Furthermore, fucoxanthin significantly increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and decreased activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase for regulating fatty  synthesis. The results suggest that fucoxanthin is an effective marine nature compound for increasing lipolysis and inhibiting lipogenesis in  induced fatty liver cells through promoted Sirt1/AMPK pathway.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of our research was to analyze the overall FAHFA composition in a common diet, as only a partial FAHFA composition has been revealed so far (only the PAHSA subclass was analyzed in a few foods). A new approach to the FAHFAs analysis includes nano-LC and post-column modifier followed by negative ion mass spectrometry, in order to obtain maximum sensitivity. Analysis of different foods - oat (whole grain, coarse flakes and fine flakes), apple, clementine, lemon, strawberry, blueberry, mango, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, banana, onion, garlic, cherry tomato, carrot, parsley root, pepper and radish - exhibited wide inter-food variation in the FAHFA profiles. Sixteen analyzed FAHFAs (palmitic, , palmitoleic and stearic hydroxy-esters) showed microgram to low nanogram levels (0.165 ng/g - 32 μg/g FW), with the highest abundancy in oat, clementine, garlic and pineapple. Stearic  hydroxy stearic  (SAHSA) was the most abundant FAHFA, especially in the food with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and beneficial metabolic effects. In contrary, the PAHSA - previously proven to have the strongest antihyperglycemic and insulin-sensitizing effects, was not present in some foods (radish, avocado, mango, lemon, cherry tomato, kiwi). Our study proves the importance of overall FAHFA analysis in food (especially in a functional food), because of their potential metabolic benefits and possible future incorporation in special diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29440279>Impairment of PPAR and the Fatty  Oxidation Pathway Aggravates Renal Fibrosis during Aging.</a></h2><p>Defects in the renal fatty  oxidation (FAO) pathway have been implicated in the development of renal fibrosis. Although, compared with young kidneys, aged kidneys show significantly increased fibrosis with impaired kidney function, the mechanisms underlying the effects of aging on renal fibrosis have not been investigated. In this study, we investigated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR) and the FAO pathway as regulators of age-associated renal fibrosis. The expression of PPAR and the FAO pathway-associated proteins significantly decreased with the accumulation of lipids in the renal tubular epithelial region during aging in rats. In particular, decreased PPAR protein expression associated with increased expression of PPAR-targeting microRNAs. Among the microRNAs with increased expression during aging, miR-21 efficiently decreased PPAR expression and impaired FAO when ectopically expressed in renal epithelial cells. In cells pretreated with  to induce lipid stress, miR-21 treatment further enhanced lipid accumulation. Furthermore, treatment with miR-21 significantly exacerbated the TGF--induced fibroblast phenotype of epithelial cells. We verified the physiologic importance of our findings in a calorie restriction model. Calorie restriction rescued the impaired FAO pathway during aging and slowed fibrosis development. Finally, compared with kidneys of aged littermate controls, kidneys of aged PPAR mice showed exaggerated lipid accumulation, with decreased activity of the FAO pathway and a severe fibrosis phenotype. Our results suggest that impaired renal PPAR signaling during aging aggravates renal fibrosis development, and targeting PPAR is useful for preventing age-associated CKD.Copyright © 2018 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28602867>Effect of Gangjihwan on hepatic steatosis and  in high fat diet-fed mice.</a></h2><p>Gangjihwan (DF), a polyherbal drug composed of Ephedra intermedia Schrenk et C. A. Mayer (Ephedraceae), Lithospermum erythrorhizon Siebold et Zuccarini (Borraginaceae), and Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae), is used to treat obesity in local Korean clinics. The constituents of DF have traditionally been reported to exert anti-obesity and anti-nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) effects. Thus, we investigated the effects of DF on obesity and NAFLD and the underlying mechanisms.DF was extracted with water (DF-FW), 30% ethyl alcohol (DF-GA30), or 70% ethyl alcohol (DF-GA70). The chemical profile of DF was monitored using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ultraviolet analysis. The effects of DF on indices of obesity and NAFLD in high fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6J mice and HepG2 cells were examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Oil red O staining, hematoxylin-eosin staining, toluidine blue staining, and immunohistochemistry.The presence of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, aloe-emodin, and emodin in DF was determined by 3D chromatography using HPLC. Administration of DF-GA70 to HFD-fed obese mice decreased body weight, epididymal adipose tissue mass, and epididymal adipocyte size. DF-GA70 reduced serum levels of free fatty acids and triglycerides. All three DF extracts lowered serum alanine transaminase levels, hepatic lipid accumulation, and infiltration of macrophages, with the largest effects observed for DF-GA70. DF-GA70 increased mRNA levels of fatty  oxidation genes and decreased mRNA levels of genes for lipogenesis and  in the liver of obese mice. Treatment of HepG2 cells with a mixture of  and palmitoleic  induced significant lipid accumulation, whereas all three DF extracts inhibited lipid accumulation. DF-GA70 also altered the expression of lipolytic and lipogenic genes in HepG2 cells.These results indicate that DF inhibits obesity and obesity-induced severe hepatic steatosis and  without any adverse effects and that these effects may be mediated by regulation of the hepatic expression of lipid metabolism and inflammatory genes. These findings suggest that DF is a safe and efficient anti-obesity and anti-nonalcoholic steatohepatosis drug.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Zi Dian Fang (ZDF) is a multi-target Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) used to treat both the symptoms and root causes of ITP, with fewer side effects than hormone-based treatments. This study analysis of the therapeutic effects of ZDF on ITP from three aspects: platelet proliferation, immunoregulation, and . After detection of 52 chemical constituents of ZDF by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, The main targets and pathways affected by ZDF were screened by network pharmacology and verified by Western blot and ELISA. Meanwhile, metabolomics analysis were applied to a mouse model of ITP to identify and screen endogenous terminal metabolites differentially regulated by ZDF. Integrated network pharmacology and metabolomics analysis of the therapeutic effects of ZDF on ITP may be as follows: ZDF counteracts ITP symptoms mainly by inhibiting Ras/MAPKs (Ras/Mitogen-activated protein kinases) pathway, and the expression of upstream protein (Ras) and downstream protein (p-ERK, p-JNK, p-p38) were inhibited, which affects the content of effect index associated with proliferation (Thrombopoietin, TPO; Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, GM-CSF),  (Tumor necrosis factor-α, TNF-α; Interleukin-6, IL-6), immune (Interleukin-2, IL-2; Interferon-gamma, IFN-γ; Interleukin-4, IL-4), so that the body's arginine, Δ-prostaglandin j2 (Δ-PGJ2), 9--Retinoic , sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P),  amide and other 12 endogenous metabolites significantly changes.

Pequi almond oil (PAO) has been reported to possess unsaturated fatty  and antioxidant compounds related to beneficial effects on oxidation and inflammatory conditions. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the hepatoprotective effects of handmade and coldpressed PAO on CCl-induced acute liver injury. The possible mechanisms underlying the effect on liver injury enzymes, histopathological parameters, lipid profile, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant and detoxification defense systems, as well as inflammatory parameters, were determined. Rats treated with PAO (3 or 6 mL/kg) for 21 days before CCl induction (3 mL/kg, 70%) showed significantly decreased levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, milder hepatic lesions and higher levels of serum high-density lipoprotein compared to CCl group. Moreover, PAO enhanced antioxidant capacity by increasing hepatic glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase enzyme activities, as well as reducing circulating concentrations of leptin and inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6, leukotrienes -4 and -5 and the tumor necrosis factor receptor. In summary, PAO, especially cold-pressed oil, attenuated the CCl-induced alterations in serum and hepatic tissue in rats due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Electrophilic nitrated fatty  derivatives, such as nitro- (OA-NO) are also noted to display a broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory effects via interaction with critical signaling pathways. An alternative process in which nitrated fatty acids may extend anti-inflammatory actions is via inactivation of XOR, a process that is more effective than allo/oxypurinol-mediated inhibition.

Nitro-fatty acids and other electrophilic fatty acids may thus be useful for the prevention and treatment of immune-mediated diseases, including inflammatory skin disorders. In this regard, subcutaneous (SC) injections of nitro  (OA-NO), an exemplary nitro-fatty , inhibit skin  in a model of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). Given the nitration of unsaturated fatty acids during metabolic and inflammatory processes and the growing use of fatty acids in topical formulations, we sought to further study the effect of nitro-fatty acids on cutaneous . To accomplish this, the effect of topically applied OA-NO on skin  was evaluated using established murine models of contact hypersensitivity (CHS). In contrast to the effects of subcutaneously injected OA-NO, topical OA-NO potentiated hapten-dependent  inducing a sustained neutrophil-dependent inflammatory response characterized by psoriasiform histological features, increased angiogenesis, and an inflammatory infiltrate that included neutrophils, inflammatory monocytes, and γδ T cells. Consistent with these results, HPLC-MS/MS analysis of skin from psoriasis patients displayed a 56% increase in nitro-conjugated linoleic  (CLA-NO) levels in lesional skin compared to non-lesional skin. These results suggest that nitro-fatty acids in the skin microenvironment are products of cutaneous inflammatory responses and, in high local concentrations, may exacerbate inflammatory skin diseases.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Dogs were then mechanically ventilated for 6 hours during which propofol (5 mg/kg/h) or sevoflurane (1.0 minimum alveolar concentration) was administered for sedation. Study end points included PO2/FIO2 ratio, pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary edema, histology, and tumor nuclear factor-α.In OA-injured animals, oxygenation was worse at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after 6-hour mechanical ventilation in sevoflurane-sedated animals compared with propofol-sedated animals, with mean difference (95% confidence interval; propofol minus sevoflurane) of 75 (39-111), 87 (55-119), 66 (44-87), and 67 (27-107) mm Hg for the respective time points. However, sevoflurane reduced the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and vascular resistance, attenuated pulmonary edema as evidenced by reduced extravascular lung water index, and decreased tumor nuclear factor-α and diffuse alveolar damage score compared with propofol in the OA-injured lungs.When compared with propofol, sevoflurane attenuates OA-induced lung damage.

Several side effects associated with chronic application of corticosteroids limit its uses. Hence, there is a need to find a safe and effective alternative agent for psoriasis treatment.The study aimed to investigate the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of petroleum ether extract of Annona squamosa seeds (ASO) as an antipsoriatic agent. The toxicity profile of ASO and its effect on psoriasis-induced  has also been determined.Physicochemical characterization was performed to determine constituents of ASO. Anti-proliferative activity of ASO was studied by Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay using HaCaT cell lines. Oxazolone-induced psoriasis in female Balb/C mice was used as an animal model for investigating in vivoefficacy of ASO. Inflammatory markers were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining of mice ears. Safety profile of ASO was confirmed by performing acute dose dermal toxicity and repeated dose dermal toxicity testing.Predominant presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids viz. linoleic  and  in ASO was confirmed by H NMR, C NMR and GC-MS analysis. The petroleum ether extract of Annona squamosa seeds showed inhibition of cell proliferation of keratinocytes (HaCaT cells). The growth inhibitory property of ASO was significantly higher than that was observed in presence of corticosteroid, clobetasol propionaste (CP). Application of ASO to the ears of Balb/C mice with oxazolone induced psoriasis showed marked reduction in erythema and edema, which was comparable to treatment with 0.05% CP cream. The increased levels of cytokines IL6, IL17, TNF-α, INF-γ, GMCSF, and infiltration of CD4 T cells observed in psoriasis lesions were decreased upon application of ASO. Acute and repeated dermal toxicity studies of ASO did not reveal any adverse events affirming the safety of ASO.The present data has demonstrated that ASO is a safe and effective anti-psoriatic agent when tested in animal models.

A consistent neuropathological feature of ALS is the extensive  around motor neurons and axonal degeneration, evidenced by accumulation of reactive astrocytes and activated microglia. Final products of inflammatory processes may be detected as a screening tool to identify treatment response. Herein, we focus on (a) detection of arachidonic  (AA) metabolization products by lipoxygenase (LOX) and prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase in SOD1 mice and (b) evaluate its response to the electrophilic nitro- (NO-OA). Regarding LOX-derived products, a significant increase in 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (12-HETE) levels was detected in SOD1 mice both in plasma and brain whereas no changes were observed in age-matched non-Tg mice at the onset of motor symptoms (90 days-old). In addition, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HETE) levels were greater in SOD1 brains compared to non-Tg. Prostaglandin levels were also increased at day 90 in plasma from SOD1 compared to non-Tg being similar in both types of animals at later stages of the disease. Administration of NO-OA 16 mg/kg, subcutaneously (s/c) three times a week to SOD1 female mice, lowered the observed increase in brain 12-HETE levels compared to the non-nitrated fatty  condition, and modified many others inflammatory markers. In addition, NO-OA significantly improved grip strength and rotarod performance compared to vehicle or OA treated animals. These beneficial effects were associated with increased hemeoxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression in the spinal cord of treated mice co-localized with reactive astrocytes. Furthermore, significant levels of NO-OA were detected in brain and spinal cord from NO-OA -treated mice indicating that nitro-fatty acids (NFA) cross brain-blood barrier and reach the central nervous system to induce neuroprotective actions. In summary, we demonstrate that LOX-derived oxidation products correlate with disease progression. Overall, we are proposing that key inflammatory mediators of AA-derived pathways may be useful as novel footprints of ALS onset and progression as well as NO-OA as a promising therapeutic compound.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772307>Nitro-fatty acids protect against steatosis and fibrosis during development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and resulting nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are reaching global epidemic proportions. Lack of non-invasive diagnostic tools and effective therapies constitute two of the major hurdles for a bona fide treatment and a reversal of NASH progression and/or regression of the disease. Nitro- (OA-NO) has been proven effective in multiple experimental models of  and fibrosis. Thus, the potential benefit of in vivo administration of OA-NO to treat advanced NAFLD was tested herein in a model of long-term NASH diet-induced liver damage.Non-invasive imaging (e.g. photoacustic-ultrasound (PA-US)) was pursued to establish advanced experimental model of NASH in mice in which both steatosis and fibrosis were diagnosed prior experimental therapy with OA-NO. Experimental controls included equimolar amounts of the non-nitrated  (OA). CLAMS and NMR-based analysis was used for energy metabolism.CLAMS and NMR-based analysis demonstrates that OA-NO improves body composition and energy metabolism and inhibits hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Photoacoustic-ultrasound imaging revealed a robust inhibition of liver steatosis and fibrosis by OA-NO. RNA-sequencing analysis uncovered  and fibrosis as major pathways suppressed by OA-NO administration, as well as regulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis pathways, with a robust inhibition of SREBP1 proteolytic activation and subsequent lipogenesis gene expression by OA-NO. These results were further supported by histological analysis and quantification of lipid accumulation, lobular  (F4/80 staining) and fibrosis (collagen deposition, αSMA staining) as well as established parameters of liver damage (ALT). In vitro studies indicate that OA-NO inhibits TG biosynthesis and accumulation in hepatocytes and inhibits fibrogenesis in human stellate cells.OA-NO improve steatohepatitis and fibrosis and may constitute an effective therapeutic approach against advanced NAFLD that warrants further clinical evaluation.Copyright © 2019.

Thus, the aim of our study was (i) to evaluate the effects of three dietary free fatty acids (FFA) (elaidic (EA),  (OA) and palmitic  (PA)) on U937 human monocytes, and (ii) to study the eventual benefits of bezafibrate (BZF), a pan-agonist for PPAR isoforms (α, γ and δ) in U937 cells treated with FFA. Morphologic and functional changes were investigated by microscopic and flow cytometric methods. Cellular lipid content, lipid droplets and FA composition were identified and studied. All analyses were also realized in association with or without BZF. Contrary to OA and PA, EA slightly induced both propidium iodide-positive cells and mitochondrial depolarization. In addition, in contrast to OA and PA, EA induced only a slight increase in superoxide anion production. However, EA and OA promoted cytoplasmic lipid droplets accumulation. Only EA and OA significantly increased CD36 expression. It is noteworthy that BZF had a more or less pronounced protective effect against EA-, OA- and PA-induced side effects: BZF attenuated the impaired cell viability and inflammatory response, decreased superoxide anion production and prevented the accumulation of neutral and polar lipids. The effects were less pronounced with OA and PA than with EA. Altogether, our data revealed a benefit of BZF on the side effects induced especially with EA. It may thus be of interest in preventing the early stages of atherosclerotic plaque formation.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The objectives of this study were to explore the effects of LNPs on adiposity and the mechanisms involved, and to evaluate their impact on metabolic homeostasis.Young Zucker fa/fa rats were treated with LNP599 (10 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. Effects on body weight, adiposity (regional re-distribution, morphology, and function of adipose tissues), cardiovascular and metabolic homeostasis, and liver function were evaluated. Direct effects on insulin and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling were studied in human hepatoma HepG2 cells.LNP599 treatment limited the age-dependent remodeling and  of subcutaneous, epididymal, and visceral adipose tissues, and prevented total fat deposits and the development of obesity. Body-weight stabilization was not related to reduced food intake but rather to enhanced energy expenditure and thermogenesis. Cardiovascular and metabolic parameters were also improved and were significantly correlated with body weight but not with plasma norepinephrine. Insulin and AMPK signaling were enhanced in hepatic tissues of treated animals, whereas blood markers of hepatic disease and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were reduced. In cultured HepG2 cells, LNP ligands phosphorylated AMPK and the downstream acetyl-CoA carboxylase and prevented -induced intracellular lipid accumulation. They also significantly potentiated insulin-mediated AKT activation and this was independent from AMPK.Selective I imidazoline receptor agonists protect against the development of adiposity and obesity, and the associated cardio-metabolic disorders. Activation of I receptors in the liver, leading to stimulation of the cellular energy sensor AMPK and insulin sensitization, and in adipose tissues, leading to improvement of morphology and function, are identified as peripheral mechanisms involved in the beneficial actions of these ligands.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29180108>Palmitate induces neuroinflammation, ER stress, and Pomc mRNA expression in hypothalamic mHypoA-POMC/GFP neurons through novel mechanisms that are prevented by oleate.</a></h2><p>Dietary fats can modulate brain function. How free fatty acids (FFAs) alter hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons remain undefined. The saturated FFA, palmitate, increased neuroinflammatory and ER stress markers, as well as Pomc mRNA levels, but did not affect insulin signaling, in mHypoA-POMC/GFP-2 neurons. This effect was mediated through the MAP kinases JNK and ERK. Further, the increase in Pomc was dependent on palmitoyl-coA synthesis, but not de novo ceramide synthesis, as inhibition of SPT enhanced palmitate-induced Pomc expression, while methylpalmitate had no effect. While palmitate concomitantly induces neuroinflammation and ER stress, these effects were independent of changes in Pomc expression. Palmitate thus has direct acute effects on Pomc, which appears to be important for negative feedback, but not directly related to neuroinflammation. The monounsaturated FFA oleate completely blocked the palmitate-mediated increase in neuroinflammation, ER stress, and Pomc mRNAs. This study provides insight into the complex central metabolic regulation by FFAs.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

These fatty acids have been reported to have anti-inflammatory activity in the intestine. However, little is known about their effects in the brain. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of these fatty acids on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory processes in mouse microglial cells (BV-2 cells). KetoC and HYA inhibited LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production and suppressed the expression of inducible NO synthase in BV-2 cells. NO changes in these inhibitory effects were observed with AH7614, a G-protein coupled receptor 120 antagonist, or the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors antagonists, GW6471 and GW9662. In addition, KetoC and HYA did not inhibit translocation of p65, a subunit of NF-κB, or IκB degradation. Similarly, no effect on p38 or JNK phosphorylation was observed. However, KetoC and HYA were found to inhibit ERK phosphorylation induced by LPS, suggesting that these fatty acids may exert their anti-inflammatory effects through the inhibition of ERK activation in microglial cells.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Conjugated fatty acids (CFA), namely isomers of linoleic and linolenic  (i.e. CLA and CLNA, respectively) can positively modulate  processes and energy metabolism, promoting anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant effects, improved lipid profiles and insulin resistance, among others. Bioactive doses have been indicated to be above 1 g/d, yet these cannot be achieved through a moderate intake (i.e. 1-2 servings) of natural sources, and certain CLA-containing products have limited commercial availability. Such handicaps have fueled research interest in finding alternative fortification strategies. In recent years, screening of dairy products for CFA-producing bacteria has attracted much attention and has led to the identification of some promising strains, including Bifidobacterium breve NCIMB 702258. This strain has shown interesting producing capabilities in model systems as well as positive modulation of lipid metabolism activities in animal studies. Accordingly, the aim of this research work was to assay B. breve NCIMB 702258 in semi-skimmed milk to produce a probiotic fermented dairy product enriched in bioactive CLA and CLNA. The effect of substrates (LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA) on growth performance and membrane fatty acids profile was also studied, as these potential modifications have been associated to stress response. When tested in cys-MRS culture medium, LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA impaired the fatty  synthesis by B. breve since membrane concentrations for stearic and  acids decreased. Variations in the C18:1 c11 and lactobacillic  concentrations, may suggest that these substrates are also affecting the membrane fluidity. Bifidobacterium breve CFA production capacity was first assessed in cys-MRS with LA, α-LNA, γ-LNA or all substrates together at 0.5 mg/mL each. This strain did not produce CFA from γ-LNA, but converted 31.12% of LA and 68.20% of α-LNA into CLA and CLNA, respectively, after incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. In a second phase, B. breve was inoculated in a commercial semi-skimmed milk with LA, α-LNA or both at 0.5 mg/mL each. Bifidobacterium breve revealed a limited capacity to synthesize CLA isomers, but was able to produce 0.062-0.115 mg/mL CLNA after 24 h at 37 °C. However, organoleptic problems were reported which need to be addressed in future studies. These results show that although CFA were produced at too low concentrations to be able to achieve solely the bioactive dose in one daily portion size, fermented dairy products are a suitable vector to deliver B. breve NCIMB 702258.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29907355>Effect of changing the lipid component of home parenteral nutrition in adults.</a></h2><p>The effect of different lipid emulsions (LEs) within the parenteral nutrition (PN) regimen of adult home PN (HPN) patients is not clear. This study investigated the effect of changing adult HPN patients from a soybean oil based LE (Intralipid) to either a fish oil containing LE (providing n-3 fatty acids) (SMOFLipid) or an olive oil based LE (ClinOleic).Thirty two adults receiving long-term HPN with Intralipid as the LE were transferred to receive either SMOFLipid (n = 13) or ClinOleic (n = 19) for 60 days. Liver function markers, cholesterol, triglycerides, a full profile of fatty acids, and several cytokines were measured at study entry and after 60 days.SMOFLipid did not affect liver function markers, blood lipids or plasma cytokines. ClinOleic lowered both gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (P = 0.044) and interleukin-8 (P = 0.030) concentrations. Both LEs induced marked changes in the fatty  profile of plasma. SMOFLipid resulted in significant decreases in the proportions of linoleic , several other n-6 fatty acids and the essential fatty  (EFA) deficiency indicator mead  and significant increases in the proportions of the n-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic . ClinOleic resulted in significant decreases in the proportions of some saturated fatty acids, linoleic , several n-6 fatty acids, all n-3 fatty acids and mead  and a significant increase in the proportion of . The ratio of mead to arachidonic  in plasma was not altered by either SMOFLipid or ClinOleic. No patient had a mead  to arachidonic  ratio of >0.2, the cut-off used to indicate EFA deficiency.Both SMOFLipid and ClinOleic significantly alter the fatty  profile of plasma in adult HPN patients previously using Intralipid. Neither LE induces EFA deficiency in these patients. SMOFLipid did not alter liver function markers or . In contrast, ClinOleic decreased some, though not all, markers of liver function and .

It is therefore important to identify synthetic and natural molecules able to impair the toxic effects of 7KC. We determined the impact of 7KC on murine microglial BV-2 cells, especially its ability to trigger mitochondrial and peroxisomal dysfunction, and evaluated the protective effects of α- and γ-tocopherol, Trolox, and  (OA). Multiple complementary chemical assays, flow cytometric and biochemical methods were used to evaluate the antioxidant and cytoprotective properties of these molecules. According to various complementary assays to estimate antioxidant activity, only α-, and γ-tocopherol, and Trolox had antioxidant properties. However, only α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol and OA were able to impair 7KC-induced loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, which is associated with increased permeability to propidium iodide, an indicator of cell death. In addition, α-and γ-tocopherol, and OA were able to prevent the decrease in Abcd3 protein levels, which allows the measurement of peroxisomal mass, and in mRNA levels of Abcd1 and Abcd2, which encode for two transporters involved in peroxisomal β-oxidation. Thus, 7KC-induced side effects are associated with mitochondrial and peroxisomal dysfunction which can be inversed by natural compounds, thus supporting the hypothesis that the composition of the diet can act on the function of organelles involved in neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28277823>The Impact of Virgin Coconut Oil and High- Safflower Oil on Body Composition, Lipids, and Inflammatory Markers in Postmenopausal Women.</a></h2><p>This randomized crossover study compared the impact of virgin coconut oil (VCO) to safflower oil (SO) on body composition and cardiovascular risk factors. Twelve postmenopausal women (58.8 ± 3.7 year) consumed 30 mL VCO or SO for 28 days, with a 28-day washout. Anthropometrics included body weight and hip and waist circumference. Fat percent for total body, android and gynoid, fat mass, and lean mass were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Women maintained their typical diet recording 28 days of food records during the study. Results were analyzed with SPSS v24 with significance at P ≤ .05. Comparisons are reported as paired t-test since no intervention sequence effect was observed. VCO significantly raised total cholesterol, TC (+18.2 ± 22.8 mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein (+13.5 ± 16.0 mg/dL), and high-density lipoprotein, HDL (+6.6 ± 7.5 mg/dL). SO did not significantly change lipid values. TC and HDL were significantly different between test oils. The TC/HDL ratio change showed a neutral effect of both VCO and SO. One person had adverse reactions to VCO and increased . VCO decreased IL-1β for each person who had a detected sample. The impact of VCO and SO on other cytokines varied on an individual basis. This was the first study evaluating the impact of VCO on body composition in Caucasian postmenopausal women living in the United States. Results are suggestive that individuals wishing to use coconut oil in their diets can do so safely, but more studies need to be conducted with larger sample sizes, diverse populations, and more specific clinical markers such as particle size.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27621193>Dietary saturated fat and monounsaturated fat have reversible effects on brain function and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in young women.</a></h2><p>Previous literature suggests that a higher ratio of palmitic  (PA)/ (OA) in the diet induces , which may result in deficient brain insulin signaling, and, secondarily, impaired physical activity, sleep efficiency, and cognitive functioning.We hypothesized that lowering the typical dietary PA/OA would affect the activation of relevant brain networks during a working memory task and would also lower secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.In 12 female subjects participating in a randomized, cross-over trial comparing 3-week high PA diet (HPA) and low PA and a high OA diet (HOA), we evaluated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using an N-back test of working memory, cytokine secretion by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and plasma cytokine concentrations.Brain activation during the HPA diet compared to the HOA diet was increased in regions of the basal ganglia including the caudate and putamen (p<0.005). In addition, compared to the HOA diet, during the HPA diet, the plasma concentrations of IL-6 (p=0.04) and IL-1β (p=0.05) were higher, and there was a higher secretion of IL-18 (p=0.015) and a trend for higher IL-1β secretion (p=0.066) from LPS-stimulated PBMCs.The HPA diet resulted in increased brain activation in the basal ganglia compared to the HOA diet as well as increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These data provide evidence that short-term (2week) diet interventions impact brain network activation during a working memory task and that these effects are reversible since the order of the study diets was randomized. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that lowering the dietary PA content via substitution with OA also could affect cognition.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Alisma orientale (AO) is recognized as a promising candidate with therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). HepG2 hepatocyte cell line is commonly used for liver disease cell model.The HepG2 cells were cultured with the NEFAs mixture ( and palmitic acids, 2:1 ratio) for 24 h to induce hepatic steatosis. Then different doses of Alisma orientale extract (AOE) was treated to HepG2 for 24 h. Incubated cells were used for further experiments.The AOE showed inhibitory effects on lipid accumulation in the Oil Red O staining and Nile red staining tests with no cytotoxicity at a concentration of 300 μg/mL. Fatty  synthase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) mRNA and protein expression level were down-regulated after AOE treatment. Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mRNA expression level were decreased as well as p-JNK (activated form of JNK), Bax, cleaved caspase-9, caspase-3 protein expression level.

Previously, we showed that intrathecal (i.t.) administration of the albumin- (A-OA) complex in rats with SCI produced partial improvement of these symptoms and that oral 2-hydroxyoleic  (HOA, a non-hydrolyzable OA analogue), was efficacious in the modulation and treatment of nociception and pain-related anxiety, respectively. Here we observed that intrathecal treatment with the complex albumin-HOA (A-HOA) every 3 days following T9 spinal contusion injury improved locomotor function assessed with the Rotarod and inhibited TA noxious reflex activity in Wistar rats. To investigate the mechanism of action of A-HOA, microarray analysis was carried out in the spinal cord lesion area. Representative genes involved in pain and neuroregeneration were selected to validate the changes observed in the microarray analysis by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Comparison of the expression between healthy rats, SCI rats, and SCI treated with A-HOA rats revealed relevant changes in the expression of genes associated with neuronal morphogenesis and growth, neuronal survival, pain and . Thus, treatment with A-HOA not only induced a significant overexpression of growth and differentiation factor 10 (GDF10), tenascin C (TNC), aspirin (ASPN) and sushi-repeat-containing X-linked 2 (SRPX2), but also a significant reduction in the expression of prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES) and phospholipases A1 and A2 (PLA1/2). Currently, SCI has very important unmet clinical needs.

Both digestive and oxidative inflammatory conditions lead to the endogenous formation of nitrated derivatives of unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) upon generation of the proximal nitrating species nitrogen dioxide (·NO) by nitric oxide (·NO) and nitrite-dependent reactions. Nitro-FAs (NO-FAs) such as nitro- (NO-OA) and nitro-linoleic  (NO-LA) potently inhibit  and oxidative stress, regulate cellular functions, and maintain cardiovascular homeostasis. Recently, conjugated linoleic  (CLA) was identified as the preferential FA substrate of nitration in vivo. However, the functions of nitro-CLA (NO-CLA) in ECs remain to be explored. In the present study, a distinct transcriptome regulated by NO-CLA was revealed in primary human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) through RNA sequencing. Differential gene expression and pathway enrichment analysis identified numerous regulatory networks including those related to the modulation of , oxidative stress, cell cycle, and hypoxic responses by NO-CLA, suggesting a diverse impact of NO-CLA and other electrophilic nitrated FAs on cellular processes. These findings extend the understanding of the protective actions of NO-CLA in cardiovascular diseases and provide new insight into the underlying mechanisms that mediate the pleiotropic cellular responses to NO-CLA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554181>Role of  in the Gut-Liver Axis: From Diet to the Regulation of Its Synthesis via Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD1).</a></h2><p>The consumption of an olive oil rich diet has been associated with the diminished incidence of cardiovascular disease and cancer.

Despite an accumulating number of studies, no pharmacotherapy that targets NAFLD has received general approval for clinical use.Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a promising approach to treat diabetes, obesity, and associated metabolic disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, on NAFLD and obesity-associated metabolic symptoms in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.Delayed intervention with NGI001 protected against body weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia, compared with HFD alone. Adipocyte hypertrophy was prevented by administering NGI001. NGI001 inhibited impaired glucose metabolism and regulated the secretion of adipokines associated with insulin resistance. In addition, NGI001 supplementation suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and , and had little impact on kidney function. In-depth investigations showed NGI001 ameliorated fat deposition and increased AMPK phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of its major downstream target, ACC, in human hepatocytes, HuS-E/2 cells. This cascade ultimately led to the downregulation of downstream fatty  synthesis-related molecules and the upregulation of downstream β oxidation-associated molecules. Surprisingly, NGI001 decreased gene and protein expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and glucose uptake in -treated HuS-E/2 cells.Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of the novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, to attenuate or delay the onset of diet-induced metabolic diseases and NAFLD.This article is protected by copyright.

A systemic inflammatory response was indicated by an increase of C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA) and ceruloplasmin 48 h after stent implantation and by an increase of interleukin-6 (IL-6) 24 h after intervention. The increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) after 48 h was used as a marker of cell damage by oxidative stress. Multiple linear regression revealed statistically significant relationships between concentration of some fatty acids and the magnitude of inflammatory response, or oxidative stress, after stent implantation. The most significant relationship with an increase of plasma CRP was found for myristic  and, to a lesser extent, for . Trans octadecenoic , and to a lesser extent palmitooleic and nervonic fatty acids were found in inverse correlation with the CRP increase. The increase of IL-6 showed a statistically significant correlation with myristic , to a lesser extent with cis-9-eicosenoic  and to the least extent with docosahexaenoic , inversely with pentadecanoic, γ-linolenic and stearic acids. An increase of oxidative stress (MDA) significantly correlated only with γ-linolenic . Other studied markers of inflammatory response to coronary stenting were SAA and ceruloplasmin (Cp).

ZA-M was shown to promote the phosphorylation of AMPK and its upstream LKB1, followed by reduction of lipogenic gene expressions.

The aim of the present study was to examine whether EPA could affect substrate cycling in human skeletal muscle cells by altering lipolysis rate of intracellular TAG and re-esterification of fatty acids. Fatty  metabolism was studied in human myotubes using a mixture of fatty acids, consisting of radiolabelled  as tracer (14C-OA) together with EPA or PA. Co-incubation of myotubes with EPA increased cell-accumulation and incomplete fatty  oxidation of 14C-OA compared to co-incubation with PA. Lipid distribution showed higher incorporation of 14C-OA into all cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA relative to PA, with most markedly increases (3 to 4-fold) for diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol. Further, the increases in cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA were accompanied by higher lipolysis and fatty  re-esterification rate. Correspondingly, basal respiration, proton leak and maximal respiration were significantly increased in cells exposed to EPA compared to PA. Microarray and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that EPA, related to PA, significantly changed i.e. the GO terms "Neutral lipid metabolic process" and "Regulation of lipid storage". Finally, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 decreased the effect of EPA to promote fatty  accumulation. In conclusion, incubation of human myotubes with EPA, compared to PA, increased processes of fatty  turnover and oxidation suggesting that EPA may activate futile substrate cycling of fatty acids in human myotubes. Increased TAG-FA cycling may be involved in the potentially favourable effects of long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids on skeletal muscle and whole-body energy metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28506203>Optimization of Microemulsion Based Transdermal Gel of Triamcinolone.</a></h2><p>Triamcinolone is a long acting corticosteroid used in the treatment of arthritis, eczema, psoriasis and similar conditions which cause . Triamcinolone has half-life of 88min. Prolonged oral use is associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects as peptic ulcer, abdominal distention and ulcerative esophagitis as described in various patents. Microemulgel offers advantage of better stability, better loading capacity and controlled release especially for drug with short half life.Objective of the present study was to optimize microemulgel based transdermal delivery of triamcinolone.Saturated solubility of triamcinolone in various oils, surfactants and co-surfactants is estimated. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed to determine the region of transparent microemulsion. Microemulsion was evaluated for globule size (FE-SEM, zetasizer), % transmittance, pH, viscosity, conductivity etc. Design of experiment was used to optimize microemulsion based gel. Carbopol 971P and HPMC K100M were used as independent variables. Microemulsion based gel was evaluated for in-vitro as well as ex-vivo parameters.Microemulsion was formulated with , lauroglycol FCC and propylene glycol. PDI 0.197 indicated microemulsion is mono-disperse. 32 factorial design gave batch F8 as optimized. Design expert suggested drug release; gel viscosity and bio-adhesive strength were three significant dependant factors affecting the transdermal delivery. F8 showed drug release 92.62.16±1.22% through egg membrane, 95.23±1.44% through goat skin after 8hr and Korsmeyer-Peppas release model was followed.It can be concluded that a stable, effective controlled release transdermal microemulgel was optimised for triamcinolone.

However, the mechanism by which long-chain saturated fatty acids trigger  is still contentious. To elucidate this mechanism, the effect of fatty acids on the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα was investigated in the mHypoE-N42 hypothalamic cell line (N42). N42 cells were treated with lauric  (LA) and palmitic  (PA). PA challenge was carried out in the presence of either a TLR4 inhibitor, a ceramide synthesis inhibitor (L-cycloserine),  (OA) or eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). Intracellular ceramide accumulation was quantified using LC-ESI-MS/MS. PA but not LA upregulated IL-6 and TNFα. L-cycloserine, OA and EPA all counteracted PA-induced intracellular ceramide accumulation leading to a downregulation of IL-6 and TNFα. However, a TLR4 inhibitor failed to inhibit PA-induced upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, PA induced the expression of IL-6 and TNFα in N42 neuronal cells independently of TLR4 but, partially, via ceramide synthesis with OA and EPA being anti-inflammatory by decreasing PA-induced intracellular ceramide build-up. Thus, ceramide accumulation represents one on the mechanisms by which PA induces  in neurons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29206239>Type 1 diabetes alters lipid handling and metabolism in human fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</a></h2><p>Triggers of the autoimmune response that leads to type 1 diabetes (T1D) remain poorly understood. A possibility is that parallel changes in both T cells and target cells provoke autoimmune attack. We previously documented greater Ca2+ transients in fibroblasts from T1D subjects than non-T1D after exposure to fatty acids (FA) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). These data indicate that metabolic and signal transduction defects present in T1D can be elicited ex vivo in isolated cells. Changes that precede T1D, including , may activate atypical responses in people that are genetically predisposed to T1D. To identify such cellular differences in T1D, we quantified a panel of metabolic responses in fibroblasts and peripheral blood cells (PBMCs) from age-matched T1D and non-T1D subjects, as models for non-immune and immune cells, respectively. Fibroblasts from T1D subjects accumulated more lipid, had higher LC-CoA levels and converted more FA to CO2, with less mitochondrial proton leak in response to oleate alone or with TNFα, using the latter as a model of . T1D-PBMCs contained and also accumulated more lipid following FA exposure. In addition, they formed more peroxidized lipid than controls following FA exposure. We conclude that both immune and non-immune cells in T1D subjects differ from controls in terms of responses to FA and TNFα. Our results suggest a differential sensitivity to inflammatory insults and FA that may precede and contribute to T1D by priming both immune cells and their targets for autoimmune reactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27490779>Swertiamarin ameliorates  induced lipid accumulation and oxidative stress by attenuating gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis in hepatic steatosis.</a></h2><p>Swertiamarin, a bitter secoiridoid glycoside, is an antidiabetic drug with lipid lowering activity meliorates insulin resistance in Type 2 Diabetes condition. Therefore, the study was designed to explore the antioxidant and hypolipidemic activity of swertiamarin in ameliorating NAFLD caused due to hepatic lipid accumulation,  and insulin resistance. Steatosis was induced in HepG2 cells by supplementing 1mM  (OA) for 24h which was marked by significant accumulation of lipid droplets. This was determined by Oil Red O (ORO) staining and triglyceride accumulation. Swertiamarin (25μg/ml) decreased triglyceride content by 2 folds and effectively reduced LDH release (50%) activity by protecting membrane integrity thus, preventing apoptosis evidenced by reduced cleavage of Caspase 3 and PARP1. We observed that swertiamarin significantly increased the expressions of major insulin signaling proteins like Insulin receptor (IR), PI(3)K, pAkt with concomitant reduction in p307 IRS-1. AMPK was activated by swertiamarin action, thus restoring insulin sensitivity in hepatocytes. In addition, qPCR results confirmed OA up-regulated Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein (SREBP)-1c and fatty  synthase (FAS), resulting in increased fatty  synthesis. Swertiamarin effectively modulated PPAR-α, a major potential regulator of carbohydrate metabolism which, in turn, decreased the levels of the gluconeogenic enzyme PEPCK, further restricting hepatic glucose production and fatty  synthesis. Cumulatively, swertiamarin targets potential metabolic regulators AMPK and PPAR-α, through which it regulates hepatic glycemic burden, fat accumulation, insulin resistance and ROS in hepatic steatosis which emphasizes clinical significance of swertiamarin in regulating metabolism and as a suitable candidate for treating NAFLD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

CD36, a class B scavenger receptor, is highly expressed in the renal proximal tubules and mediates FFA uptake. It is not clear whether FFA- and proteinuria-mediated CD36 activation coordinates NLRP3 inflammasomes to induce renal tubular injury and . In this study, we investigated the roles of CD36 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in FFA-induced renal injury in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. HFD-fed C57BL/6 mice and palmitate-treated HK2 renal tubular cells were used as in vivo and in vitro models. Immunohistochemical staining showed that CD36, IL-1β, and IL-18 levels increased progressively in the kidneys of HFD-fed mice. Sulfo- N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO), a CD36 inhibitor, attenuated the HFD-induced upregulation of NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18 and suppressed the colocalization of NLRP3 and ASC in renal tubular cells. In vitro, SSO abolished the palmitate-induced activation of IL-1β, IL-18, and caspase-1 in HK2 proximal tubular cells. Furthermore, treatment with SSO and the knockdown of caspase-1 expression by siRNA both inhibited palmitate-induced cell death and apoptosis in HK2 cells. Collectively, palmitate causes renal tubular , cell death, and apoptosis via the CD36/NLRP3/caspase-1 axis, which may explain, at least in part, the mechanism underlying FFA-related renal tubular injury. The blockade of CD36-induced cellular processes is therefore a promising strategy for treating obesity-related nephropathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27718238>Electrophilic nitro-fatty acids suppress allergic contact dermatitis in mice.</a></h2><p>Reactions between nitric oxide (NO), nitrite (NO2-), and unsaturated fatty acids give rise to electrophilic nitro-fatty acids (NO -FAs), such as nitro  (OA-NO ) and nitro linoleic  (LNO ). Endogenous electrophilic fatty acids (EFAs) mediate anti-inflammatory responses by modulating metabolic and inflammatory signal transduction reactions. Hence, there is considerable interest in employing NO -FAs and other EFAs for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory disorders. Thus, we sought to determine whether OA-NO , an exemplary nitro-fatty , has the capacity to inhibit cutaneous .We evaluated the effect of OA-NO on allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) using an established model of contact hypersensitivity in C57Bl/6 mice utilizing 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene as the hapten.We found that subcutaneous (SC) OA-NO injections administered 18 h prior to sensitization and elicitation suppresses ACD in both preventative and therapeutic models. In vivo SC OA-NO significantly inhibits pathways that lead to inflammatory cell infiltration and the production of inflammatory cytokines in the skin. Moreover, OA-NO is capable of enhancing regulatory T-cell activity. Thus, OA-NO treatment results in anti-inflammatory effects capable of inhibiting ACD by inducing immunosuppressive responses.Overall, these results support the development of OA-NO as a promising therapeutic for ACD and provides new insights into the role of electrophilic fatty acids in the control of cutaneous immune responses potentially relevant to a broad range of allergic and inflammatory skin diseases.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Considering that lipid accumulation in the cell is important in promoting tissue , the purpose of this study is to analyze the fatty  profile in red blood cell membranes of patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), in order to identify and validate membrane profiles possibly associated with the degree of hepatic damage.This work presents data obtained at baseline from 101 subjects that participated to a nutritional trial (registration number: ) enrolling consecutive subjects with NAFLD. Diagnosis of liver steatosis was performed by using vibration-controlled elastography implemented on FibroScan. Fatty acids, extracted from phospholipids of erythrocyte membranes, were quantified by gas chromatography method.The subjects with severe NAFLD showed a significant decrease of the ratio of stearic  to  (saturation index, SI) compared to controls, 1.281 ± 0.31 vs 1.5 ± 0.29, respectively. Low levels of SI in red blood cell membranes, inversely associated with degree of liver damage, suggest that an impairment of circulating cell membrane structure can reflect modifications that take place in the liver. Subjects with severe NAFLDalso showed higher levels of elongase 5 enzymatic activity, evaluated as vaccenic  to palmitoleic  ratio.Starting from these evidences, our findings show the importance of lipidomic approach in the diagnosis and the staging of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28927849>Metabolome-wide association study of peripheral parasitemia in Plasmodium vivax malaria.</a></h2><p>Plasmodium vivax is one of the leading causes of malaria worldwide. Infections with this parasite cause diverse clinical manifestations, and recent studies revealed that infections with P. vivax can result in severe and fatal disease. Despite these facts, biological traits of the host response and parasite metabolism during P. vivax malaria are still largely underexplored. Parasitemia is clearly related to progression and severity of malaria caused by P. falciparum, however the effects of parasitemia during infections with P. vivax are not well understood.We conducted an exploratory study using a high-resolution metabolomics platform that uncovered significant associations between parasitemia levels and plasma metabolites from 150 patients with P. vivax malaria. Most plasma metabolites were inversely associated with higher levels of parasitemia. Top predicted metabolites are implicated into pathways of heme and lipid metabolism, which include biliverdin, bilirubin, palmitoylcarnitine, stearoylcarnitine, phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine,  and omega-carboxy-trinor-leukotriene B4.The abundance of several plasma metabolites varies according to the levels of parasitemia in patients with P. vivax malaria. Moreover, our data suggest that the host response and/or parasite survival might be affected by metabolites involved in the degradation of heme and metabolism of several lipids. Importantly, these data highlight metabolic pathways that may serve as targets for the development of new antimalarial compounds.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

This mutation is associated with accelerated activation of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ1) which contributes to the formation of aneurysms in the root of the aorta. There is an imbalance in the synthesis of thromboxane A (TXA) and prostacyclin, that is a consequence of a differential protein expression of the isoforms of cyclooxygenases (COXs), suggesting an alteration of arachidonic  (AA) metabolism. The aim of this study was to analyze the participation of AA metabolism associated with inflammatory factors in the dilation and dissection of the aortic aneurysm in patients with MFS. A decrease in AA ( = 0.02), an increase in  (OA), TGFβ1, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), prostaglandin E (PGE) ( < 0.05), and COXs activity ( = 0.002) was found. The expressions of phospholipase A (PLA), cytochrome P450 (CYP450 4A), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), COX2 and TXA2R ( < 0.05) showed a significant increase in the aortic aneurysm of patients with MFS compared to control subjects. COX1, 6-keto-prostaglandin 1 alpha (6-keto-PG) and 8-isoprostane did not show significant changes. Histological examination of the aortas showed an increase of cystic necrosis, elastic fibers and collagen in MFS. The results suggest that there are inflammatory factors coupled to genetic factors that predispose to aortic endothelial dysfunction in the aortic tissue of patients with MFS. There is a decrease in the percentage of AA, associated with an increase of PLA, COX2/TXA2R, CYP450 4A, and 5-LOX which leads to a greater synthesis of PGE than of 6-keto-PGF, thus contributing to the formation of the aortic aneurysm. The evident loss of the homeostasis in these mechanisms confirms that there is a participation of the AA pathway in the aneurysm progression in MFS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28229279>Immune dysfunction and increased oxidative stress state in diet-induced obese mice are reverted by nutritional supplementation with monounsaturated and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Obesity is associated with impaired immune defences and chronic low levels of  and oxidation. In addition, this condition may lead to premature aging. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of a nutritional supplementation with monounsaturated and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on several functions and oxidative stress parameters in peritoneal immune cells of obese mice, as well as on the life span of these animals.Obesity was induced in adult female ICR/CD1 by the administration of a high-fat diet (HFD) for 14 weeks. During the last 6 weeks of HFD feeding, one group of obese mice received the same HFD, supplemented with 1500 mg of 2-hydroxyoleic  (2-OHOA) and another with 3000 mg of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). Several functions and oxidative stress parameters of peritoneal leukocytes were evaluated.The groups of obese mice treated with 2-OHOA or with EPA and DHA showed a significant improvement in several functions such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, digestion capacity, Natural killer activity and lymphoproliferation in response to mitogens. All of these functions, which were decreased in obese mice, increased reaching similar levels to those found in non-obese controls. Both treatments also improved oxidative stress parameters such as xanthine oxidase activity, which decreased, catalase activity and glutathione levels, which increased.These data suggest that dietary supplementation with monounsaturated and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids could be an effective nutritional intervention to restore the immune response and oxidative stress state, which are impaired in obese mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29434789>Effects of pumpless extracorporeal lung assist on hemodynamics, gas exchange and inflammatory cascade response during experimental lung injury.</a></h2><p>Pumpless extracorporeal lung assist (pECLA) has been reported to efficiently remove the systemic CO production and provide mild to moderate oxygenation, thereby allowing for ventilator settings and modes prioritizing oxygenation and lung protection. However, an adequate bypass flow, the capacity to provide respiratory support and the effect on the inflammatory cascade response and tissue perfusion require further study to be determined. After induction of acute lung injury (ALI) by  injection, pECLA was implemented in 12 anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated dogs for 48 h. Improved oxygenation [partial oxygen pressure (PaO) and oxygen saturation (SaO) was measured by arterial blood gas analysis, and increased by 29 and 18%, respectively] and CO elimination (partial CO pressure decreased by 43.35%) were obtained after pECLA implementation. A maximum arterio-venous shunt flow of up to 25% of the foundational CO resulted in stable hemodynamics. The pECLA procedure did not elicit any further increase in the concentration of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and endothelin-1 compared with that in the group subjected to  injection only. In addition, the pECLA procedure had no effect on lactate levels and urine production. In conclusion, pECLA is an efficient and promising strategy for providing a mild to moderate oxygenation and adequate decarboxylation, while avoiding excessive inflammatory cascade response and tissue hypoperfusion in an experimental ALI model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820969>Dual Specificity Phosphatase 12 Regulates Hepatic Lipid Metabolism Through Inhibition of the Lipogenesis and Apoptosis Signal-Regulating Kinase 1 Pathways.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Due to the growing economic burden of NAFLD on public health, it has become an emergent target for clinical intervention. DUSP12 is a member of the dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family, which plays important roles in brown adipocyte differentiation, microbial infection, and cardiac hypertrophy. However, the role of DUSP12 in NAFLD has yet to be clarified. Here, we reveal that DUSP12 protects against hepatic steatosis and  in L02 cells after palmitic / treatment. We demonstrate that hepatocyte specific DUSP12-deficient mice exhibit high-fat diet (HFD)-induced and high-fat high-cholesterol diet-induced hyperinsulinemia and liver steatosis and decreased insulin sensitivity. Consistently, DUSP12 overexpression in hepatocyte could reduce HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and . At the molecular level, steatosis in the absence of DUSP12 was characterized by elevated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which mediates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and hepatic metabolism. DUSP12 physically binds to ASK1, promotes its dephosphorylation, and inhibits its action on ASK1-related proteins, JUN N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK in order to inhibit lipogenesis under high-fat conditions. Conclusion: DUSP12 acts as a positive regulator in hepatic steatosis and offers potential therapeutic opportunities for NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

Obese pregnant women have dyslipidemia; however, whether obesity impacts placental lipid transport and metabolism remains to be fully established. Palmitoleic  (POA), an FA with anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties, is synthesized from palmitic  (PA) catalyzed by stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) activity. We hypothesized that the uptake and incorporation of FAs and POA synthesis are reduced in primary human trophoblasts (PHTs) isolated from pregnancies complicated by maternal obesity. Villous cytotrophoblasts were isolated from 7 placentas of obese [body mass index (BMI) = 37.5 ± 1.9] and 12 normal (BMI = 23.6 ± 0.6) mothers. FA uptake and incorporation were assessed using uniformly labeled (U[C])-FA mixtures of PA,  (OA), linoleic , and docosahexaenoic . Cellular [C] FAs were quantified both in total cellular lipids and in lipid classes by GC-MS. Uptake and incorporation of [C] FAs in total cellular lipids were not different in PHTs isolated from obese mothers compared with normal mothers. Only the concentration of OA was increased in the triglyceride fraction ( < 0.05) if the mother was obese. We found an isotopic enrichment of POA after U[C]-PA treatment, demonstrating SCD activity in PHT cells. Labeled POA content and the POA:PA ratio were significantly lower in PHTs isolated from placentas of obese mothers compared with normal, healthy controls. Decreased syncytiotrophoblast POA synthesis may contribute to insulin resistance and low-grade  in the mother, placenta, or fetus (or a combination of the 3) in pregnancies complicated by obesity.-Ferchaud-Roucher, V., Barner, K., Jansson, T., Powell, T.

The endocannabinoid-like compounds oleoylethanolamine (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamine (PEA) play an important role in digestive regulation, and we hypothesized they would also modulate intestinal permeability. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured in human Caco-2 cells to assess permeability after application of OEA and PEA and relevant antagonists. Cells treated with OEA and PEA were stained for cytoskeletal F-actin changes and lysed for immunoassay. OEA and PEA were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. OEA (applied apically, logEC -5.4) and PEA (basolaterally, logEC -4.9; apically logEC -5.3) increased Caco-2 resistance by 20-30% via transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV)-1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α. Preventing their degradation (by inhibiting fatty  amide hydrolase) enhanced the effects of OEA and PEA. OEA and PEA induced cytoskeletal changes and activated focal adhesion kinase and ERKs 1/2, and decreased Src kinases and aquaporins 3 and 4. In Caco-2 cells treated with IFNγ and TNFα, OEA (via TRPV1) and PEA (via PPARα) prevented or reversed the cytokine-induced increased permeability compared to vehicle (0.1% ethanol). PEA (basolateral) also reversed increased permeability when added 48 or 72 h after cytokines (P < 0.001, via PPARα).

Since it can be made through de novo synthesis in animals, it is not an essential fatty . While it has become clear that dietary  regulates many biological processes, the signaling pathway involved in these regulations remains poorly defined. In this work we tested the impact of an -rich diet on hepatic gene expression. We were particularly interested in addressing the contribution of Liver X Receptors (LXR) in the control of genes involved in hepatic lipogenesis, an essential process in whole body energy homeostasis. We used wild-type mice and transgenic mice deficient for both α and β Liver X Receptor isoforms (LXR-/-) fed a control or an oleate enriched diet. We observed that hepatic-lipid accumulation was enhanced as well as the expression of lipogenic genes in the liver of wild-type mice fed the oleate enriched diet. In contrast, none of these changes occurred in the liver of LXR-/- mice. Strikingly, oleate-rich diet reduced cholesterolemia in wild-type mice and induced signs of liver  and damage in LXR-/- mice but not in wild-type mice. This work suggests that dietary  reduces cholesterolemia while promoting LXR-dependent hepatic lipogenesis without detrimental effects to the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31245005>Individual free fatty acids have unique associations with inflammatory biomarkers, insulin resistance and insulin secretion in healthy and gestational diabetic pregnant women.</a></h2><p>We investigated the relationships of maternal circulating individual free fatty acids (FFA) with insulin resistance, insulin secretion and inflammatory biomarkers during mid-pregnancy.The data were drawn from a prospective cohort of generally healthy pregnant women (n=1368, African-American 36%, Hispanic 48%, Caucasian 16%) in Camden, NJ. We quantitatively determined 11 FFAs, seven cytokine/adipokine, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and C-peptide levels from the fasting blood samples that were collected at 16 weeks of gestation. Multivariate analyses were performed along with separate analyses for each individual FFA.High HOMA-IR (p<0.001) and C-peptide (p<0.0001) levels were positively associated with a twofold to fourfold increased risk for developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Negative relationships were found with specific FFAs (molecular percentage, palmitoleic, , linolenic, myristic acids) and HOMA-IR and C-peptide levels (p<0.01 to p<0.0001). In contrast, palmitic, stearic, arachidonic, dihomo-γ-linolenic (DGLA) and docosahexaenoic acids were positively associated with HOMA-IR and C-peptide (p<0.01 to p<0.0001). The individual FFAs also predicted cytokine/adipokine levels. For example, women who had elevated DGLA (highest quartile) were twice as (adjusted OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.98) likely to have higher interleukin (IL)-8 (p<0.0001) levels. Conversely, women with high palmitoleic, , and linolenic  levels had reduced odds (≥2-fold, p<0.01 to p<0.001) for having higher IL-8, IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels.Our results suggest that maternal individual FFAs uniquely affect insulin resistance and secretion. The effects are either direct or indirect via modulation of the inflammatory response.

We evaluated whether CaSR stimulation influences adipocyte triglyceride (TG) and fatty  binding protein 4 (aP2) content, and hepatocyte TGs and proinflammatory cytokine expression. The effect of the calcimimetic cinacalcet on TGs (fluorimetry), lipogenic genes (qPCR) and aP2 (immunoblot) was evaluated in LS14 adipocytes or AT. In the human HepG2 hepatic cell line, we assessed CaSR expression and cinacalcet effect on TGs and lipogenic and proinflammatory genes. CaSR activation decreased adipocyte TG content by 20% and the expression of GPD and LPL by 34% and 20%, respectively. Cinacalcet increased aP2 protein expression by 60%. CaSR expression was shown in HepG2 cells and human liver samples. Cinacalcet-treated HepG2 cells in the presence of  exhibited a19% increased TG content. No changes were observed in the expression of lipogenic genes in HepG2 cells, however there was a 50%-300% elevation in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. CaSR activation in adipocytes may associate with decreased TG storage ability and increased aP2. Hepatic CaSR stimulation may elevate steatosis and proinflammatory factors.

Mice were weighed, food intake measured and glucose tolerance calculated using intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT). Proteomic analysis was carried out to determine if hypothalamic proteins were changed by a HFD. The direct effects of dietary fatty acids on mitochondrial morphology and on one of the proteins most changed by a HFD, dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP-2) a microtubule-associated protein which regulates microtubule dynamics, were also tested in mHypoE-N42 (N42) neuronal cells challenged with palmitic  (PA) and  (OA).Mice on the HFD, as expected, showed increased adiposity and glucose intolerance. Hypothalamic proteomic analysis revealed changes in 104 spots after 3 days on HFD, which, when identified by LC/MS/MS, were found to represent 78 proteins mainly associated with cytoskeleton and synaptic plasticity, stress response, glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function. Over half of the changed proteins have also been reported to be changed in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Also,in N42 neurons mitochondrial morphology and DRP-2 levels were altered by PA but not by OA.These results demonstrate that within 3 days, there is a relatively large effect of HFD on the hypothalamic proteome indicative of cellular stress, altered synaptic plasticity and mitochondrial function, but not .

Increasing cardiac PA levels, resulted in shortened atrial action potential duration, and increased I density. Inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) prevented increases in I due to PA. Acute (≥1hr) exposure of atrial myocytes to exogenous PA (1 mM) increased the density of the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current I, while it was decreased with the unsaturated  (OA, 1 mM). Serine-threonine protein phosphatase-2 (PP2A) inhibition with cantharidin reversed the effect of OA on I.Our data provide evidence of a novel lipotoxic guinea pig model with signs of vulnerability to arrhythmias.

Herein, the literature related to chemical constituents and pharmacological activities were searched in November 2016.The literature provided information on ethnopharmacological uses of the South American and African species of the genus Hymenaea (e.g., H. courbaril, H. stigonocarpa, H. onblogifolia, H. martiana, H. parvifolia (South America) and H. verrucosa (African species)) for the treatment of multi-factorial diseases. From these plant species, more than 130 compounds, including fatty acids, flavonoids, terpenoids and steroids, phthalides, phenolic acids, procyanidins and coumarins were identified. Experimental evidences confirmed that the Hymenaea spp. could be used in treating inflammatory disorders, asthma, diarrhea, and some microbial infections. However, reports on the toxicity of Hymenaea species remain scarce.Plants of this genus have offered bioactive samples, both from crude extracts and pure compounds, thus substantiating their effectiveness in traditional medicine. However, intensive investigations of all the species of Hymenaea spp. relating to phytochemical and pharmacological properties, especially their mechanism of action, safety and efficacy could be the future introspection.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We addressed these issues by constructing an yeast  strain having a complete metabolic pathway for DGLA synthesis by introducing two desaturase and one elongase genes to convert endogenous  to DGLA. Taking advantage of well-known safety of , we previously investigated the efficacy of heat-killed whole DGLA-producing yeast cells on irritant contact dermatitis, and showed that oral intake of this yeast significantly suppressed inflammatory reactions, whereas no such suppression was observed by the intake of 25 times the amount of purified DGLA. Since this method is considered to be a simple and efficient way to suppress , we examined its effectiveness against allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) in this study and showed that this method was also effective against ACD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29864915>Dihydrocurcumin ameliorates the lipid accumulation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance in -induced L02 and HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Curcumin is a polyphenol compound with many pharmacological activities including antioxidant, lipid-loweing and liver protective. Dihydrocurcumin (DHC) is one of the major metabolites of curcumin. So far, the pharmacological activity of DHC has not been reported. Here, we evaluate the effects of DHC on  (OA)-induced lipid accumulation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance and the underlying mechanism in L02 and HepG2 cells.OA-induced L02 and HepG2 cells were used as the in vitro model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, glucose uptake and cell  were evaluated by cellular biochemical assay, respectively. Signaling pathways involved in lipid metabolism including peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPARα), the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1C (SREBP-1C) and patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3), glucose uptake including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phosphorylated serine-threonine protein kinase (pAKT), and oxidative stress including nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), cytochrome P450 4A (CYP4A) and 2E1 (CYP2E1) were investigated by western blotting and RT-qPCR, respectively.DHC decreased the levels of cellular triglycerides (TG) by regulating the mRNA and protein expression levels of SREBP-1C, PNPLA3 and PPARα. At the same time, DHC improved the hepatocellular glucose uptake by increasing the protein expression levels of pAKT and PI3K. Furthermore, DHC reduced the levels of cellular NO and ROS via Nrf2 signaling pathways.The present study firstly revealed that DHC ameliorated OA-induced steatosis through regulating the lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and insulin resistance in HepG2 and L02 cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Brucea javanica in the treatment of dysentery (also known as ulcerative colitis, UC) has not been fully illuminated. Brucea javanica oil emulsion (BJOE) is the major active and most common application form of Brucea javanica oil (BJO), which has a variety of pharmacological activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential anti-inflammatory effect of BJOE and possible mechanism of action on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC in mice.The components of BJOE were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Balb/C mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, 30mg/mL) induced colitis were treated with BJOE (0.5, 1 and 2g/kg) and two positive drugs (sulfasalazine, SASP, 200mg/kg; and azathioprine, AZA, 13mg/kg) once daily by gavage for 7 days. Mice in normal control group and DSS group were orally given the same volume of distilled water and soybean lecithin suspension (0.15g/kg) respectively. The effects of BJOE on DSS-induced UC were assessed by determination of body weight loss, disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histological analysis, as well as levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The mRNA expression of MPO, iNOS and COX-2 in colon tissues was detected by qRT-PCR. In addition, NF-κB p65, p-p65 and IκB-α, p-IκBα protein expression levels in colon tissues were investigated using Western blotting.The major components of BJOE were found to be  (62.68%) and linoleic  (19.53%) as detected by GC-MS. Our results indicated that BJOE, SASP and AZA showed beneficial effect on DSS-induced colitis in mice, and significantly reduced the body weight loss and DAI, restored the colon length, repaired colonic pathological variations, decreased histological scores, and decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and IFN-γ) as compared with the DSS group. In addition, the mRNA expression of MPO, iNOS and COX-2 induced by DSS treatment was remarkably inhibited by BJOE, SASP or AZA treatments. Furthermore, when compared with DSS-treated mice, the activation of NF-κB was significantly inhibited by AZA and BJOE treatment.Our study shows that BJOE possessed appreciable anti-inflammatory effect against murine experimental UC induced by DSS. The protective mechanism of BJOE may involve inhibition of NF-κB signal transduction pathways and subsequent down-regulation of inflammatory mediators. These findings suggest that BJOE might be an efficacious and promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of UC. Our investigation might also provide experimental evidence for the traditional application of Brucea javanica in the treatment of dysentery and might add new dimension to the clinical indications for BJOE.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The change in CL species may alter the mitochondrial membrane composition, potentially disturbing the mitochondrial structure and function during .To investigate the effect of the unsaturation of fatty acids on CL, we supplemented macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells with 18-carbon unsaturated fatty acids including  (OA, 18:1), linoleic  (LA, 18:2), α-linolenic  (ALA, 18:3), γ-linolenic  (GLA, 18:3), and stearidonic  (SDA, 18:4). Mitochondrial changes in CL were measured through mass spectrometry.Our data indicated that OA(18:1) was the most efficient fatty  that incorporated into CL, forming symmetrical CL without fatty  elongation and desaturation. In addition, LA(18:2) and ALA(18:3) were further elongated before incorporation, significantly increasing the number of double bonds and the chain length of CL. GLA and SDA were not optimal substrates for remodeling enzymes. The findings of RT-qPCR experiments revealed that none of these changes in CL occurred through the regulation of CL remodeling- or synthesis-related genes. The fatty  desaturase and transportation genes-Fads2 and Cpt1a, respectively-were differentially regulated by the supplementation of five unsaturated 18-carbon fatty acids.The process of fatty  incorporation to CL was regulated by the fatty  desaturation and transportation into mitochondria in macrophage. The double bonds of fatty acids significantly affect the incorporation process and preference. Intact OA(18:1) was incorporated to CL; LA(18:2) and ALA(18:3) were desaturated and elongated to long chain fatty  before the incorporation; GLA(18:3) and SDA(18:4) were unfavorable for the CL incorporation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29321047>Effects of concentrated long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  supplementation before radical prostatectomy on prostate cancer proliferation, , and quality of life: study protocol for a phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in north-American men. Few dietary or lifestyle interventions have been tested to prevent prostate cancer progression. Omega-3 fatty  supplementation represents a promising intervention for prostate cancer patients. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn3), more precisely eicosapentaenoic  monoacylglyceride (MAG-EPA) supplementation, on prostate cancer proliferation,  mediators and quality of life among men who will undergo radical prostatectomy.We propose a phase IIb, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of MAG-EPA supplementation for 130 men who will undergo radical prostatectomy as treatment for a prostate cancer of Gleason score ≥ 7 in an academic cancer center in Quebec City. Participants will be randomized to 6 capsules of 625 mg of fish oil (MAG-EPA) per capsule containing 500 mg of EPA daily or to identically looking capsules of high  sunflower oil (HOSO) as placebo. The intervention begins 4 to 10 weeks prior to radical prostatectomy (baseline) and continues for one year after surgery. The primary endpoint is the proliferative index (Ki-67) measured in prostate cancer cells at radical prostatectomy. A secondary endpoint includes prostate tissue levels of inflammatory mediators (cytokines and proteins) at time of radical prostatectomy. Changes in blood levels of inflammatory mediators, relative to baseline levels, at time of radical prostatectomy and 12 months after radical prostatectomy will also be evaluated. Secondary endpoints also include important aspects of psychosocial functioning and quality of life such as depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive complaints and prostate cancer-specific quality of life domains. The changes in these outcomes, relative to baseline levels, will be evaluated at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after radical prostatectomy.The results from this trial will provide crucial information to clarify the role of omega-3 supplementation on prostate cancer proliferation,  and quality of life.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: .

Optimal phenotypic flexibility, i.e., the ability to respond to a physiological challenge, is an essential indicator of health status. Therefore, health can be measured by applying a challenge test and monitoring the response of relevant phenotypic processes. In this study, we assessed the correlation of three fat-soluble vitamins, (i.e., vitamin A or retinol, vitamin D, two homologues of vitamin E) and four carotenoids (i.e., α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, and lycopene), with characteristics of metabolic and inflammatory parameters at baseline and in response to a nutritional challenge test (NCT) in a group of 36 overweight and obese male subjects, using proteomics and metabolomics platforms. The phenotypic flexibility concept implies that health can be measured by the ability to adapt to a NCT, which may offer a more sensitive way to assess changes in health status of healthy subjects.Correlation analyses of results after overnight fasting revealed a rather evenly distributed network in a number of relatively strong correlations per micronutrient, with minor overlap between correlation profiles of each compound. Correlation analyses of challenge response profiles for metabolite and protein parameters with micronutrient status revealed a network that is more skewed towards α-carotene and γ-tocopherol suggesting a more prominent role for these micronutrients in the maintenance of phenotypic flexibility. Comparison of the networks revealed that there is merely overlap of two parameters (inositol and  (C18:1)) affirming that there is a specific biomarker response profile upon NCT.Our study shows that applying the challenge test concept is able to reveal previously unidentified correlations between specific micronutrients and health-related processes, with potential relevance for maintenance of health that were not observed by correlating homeostatic measurements. This approach will contribute to insights on the influence of micronutrients on health and help to create efficient micronutrient intervention programs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29178411>Increased plasma oleoylethanolamide and palmitoleoylethanolamide levels correlate with inflammatory changes in alcohol binge drinkers: the case of HMGB1 in women.</a></h2><p>Alcohol binge drinking is a heavy pattern of alcohol consumption increasingly used by young people. In a previous study, we reported that young drinkers with a 2-year history of binge alcohol consumption had an overactivation of the innate immune system and peripheral  when compared with controls. In the present study, we measured several biolipids that are fatty  derivatives belonging to the acylethanolamide or 2-acylglycerol families in the plasma of the same subjects (n = 42; 20 men and 22 women). We found that during abstinence, alcohol binge drinkers had elevated plasma levels of oleoylethanolamide, palmitoleoylethanolamide, arachidonoylethanolamide, dihomo-γ-linolenoyl ethanolamide and linoleoyl ethanolamide, which positively correlated with changes in the mRNA expression of key inflammatory markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, such as toll-like receptors (TLR4), pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and cyclooxygenase-2. Additionally, plasma oleoylethanolamide positively correlated with plasma levels of high mobility group box-1, which is a danger-associated molecular pattern and an endogenous TLR4 agonist, specifically in female alcohol binge drinkers. No changes were observed in 2-acylglycerols in alcohol binge drinkers, although sex-related differences in these bioactive lipids as well as in palmitoleoylethanolamide and docosatetraenoylethanolamide levels were detected. These results extend the previous clinical findings observed in patients diagnosed with long-term alcohol use disorder to young users and suggest a prominent role for these lipids in the response to acute alcohol exposure.© 2017 Society for the Study of Addiction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30903378>Ameliorative effect of docosahexaenoic  on hepatocyte apoptosis and  induced by  in grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella.</a></h2><p>Our previous study has shown that overload of lipid accumulation results in cell apoptosis and  in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). In this study, we investigated the potential protective effects of docosahexaenoic  (DHA) on inhibiting  (OA)-induced apoptosis and  in grass carp hepatocytes. Firstly, the hepatocyte of grass carp were treated with OA (800 μM) and different concentration (0, 50, 100 and 200 μM) of DHA for 24 h, the apoptotic ratio, gene expression levels of apoptosis such as caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9, protein levels of Caspase3, and mRNA levels of  genes such as nf-kb, tnf-α, and il-8 were detected. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of lipogenesis genes srebp1c, fas, acc, and scd and a key enzyme of lipolysis Atgl were also detected. These results showed that the cell apoptosis and the  increased by OA were significantly attenuated by DHA (P < 0.05). Furthermore, DHA could significantly decrease fatty  synthesis gene expression levels which were induced by OA (P < 0.05). However, the hepatocytes exposed with DHA had no significant influence on the expression of Atgl. Taken together, the study indicated that DHA protects the hepatocytes against apoptosis and  induced by OA might via inhibiting fatty  synthesis, instead of promoting lipolysis.

Deficit schizophrenia is characterized by a deficit in IgM-mediated autoimmune responses to tryptophan catabolites. The presence and correlates of IgM isotype antibodies to oxidative-specific epitopes (OSEs), nitroso (NO), and nitro (NO) adducts in schizophrenia remain unknown. This study measured IgM antibodies to malondialdehyde (MDA), azelaic , phosphatidylinositol, , NO-tryptophan, NO-albumin, NO-cysteinyl, and NO-tyrosine in a sample of 80 schizophrenia patients, divided into those with and those without deficit schizophrenia, and 38 healthy controls. Deficit schizophrenia was characterized by significantly lower IgM antibody levels to all OSEs as compared with non-deficit schizophrenia and controls. Lowered IgM antibodies to MDA coupled with increased IgM levels to NO-cysteinyl and NO-tyrosine strongly predict deficit schizophrenia versus non-deficit schizophrenia with an area under the ROC curve of 0.913. A large part of the variance (21.2-42.2%) in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and excitation is explained by IgM antibody titers to MDA (inversely) and NO-cysteinyl and/or NO-tyrosine (both positively). Lower IgM antibodies to MDA are significantly associated with impairments in episodic memory including direct and delayed recall. These findings further indicate that deficit schizophrenia is a distinct phenotype of schizophrenia, which is characterized by lower natural IgM antibody levels to OSEs and relative increments in nitrosylation and nitration of proteins. It is concluded that deficits in natural IgM attenuate CIRS functions and that this impairment may drive negative symptoms and impairments in episodic memory and thus deficit schizophrenia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28847225>Downregulation of inflammatory markers by conjugated linoleic  isomers in human cultured astrocytes.</a></h2><p>Conjugated linoleic  (CLA) isomers have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory activity in the central nervous system. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether modulation of the fatty  profile by the CLA isomers c9,t11 or t10,c12CLA was associated with changes in the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules in human astrocytes.Cultured astrocytes were treated for 6 days with 100 µM fatty acids (c9,t11CLA or t10,c12CLA or ). Following the treatment, the fatty  profile of the cell and pro-inflammatory molecule expression were assessed.Only the t10,c12CLA isomer induced a significant decrease in arachidonic  and increased the ratio of docosahexaenoic /eicosapentaenoic , which constitutes indirect evidence of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha activation. Inhibition of tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and RANTES expression was observed in astrocytes treated with c9,t11CLA and t10,c12CLA.Current data demonstrate that CLA isomers, particularly t10,c12, may affect neuroinflammation by reducing the pro-inflammatory molecules in cultured astrocytes, suggesting a potential nutritional role of CLA isomers in modulating the astrocyte inflammatory response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921498>Dietary Palmitoleic  Attenuates Atherosclerosis Progression and Hyperlipidemia in Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Deficient Mice.</a></h2><p>Palmitoleic  (palmitoleate; C16:1 n-7), an omega-7 monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) found in plants and marine sources, has been shown to favorably modulate lipid and glucose metabolism. However, its impact on atherosclerosis has not been examined in detail.LDL receptor knock out (LDLR-KO) mice are fed a Western diet supplemented with 5% (w/w) palmitoleate concentrate, -rich olive oil, or none (control) for 12 weeks. Dietary palmitoleate increases hepatic C16:1 levels, improves plasma and hepatic lipid/lipoprotein profiles (≈40% decrease in triglycerides), and reduces the atherosclerotic plaque area by ≈45% compared with control or olive oil group (p < 0.05). These favorable changes are accompanied by the downregulation of key genes, such as Srebp1c, Scd1, Il-1β, and Tnfα. ApoB-depleted plasma from mice fed palmitoleate has increased cholesterol efflux capacity by 20% from ABCA1-expressing cells (p < 0.05). A beneficial effect of palmitoleate on glucose metabolism (54% decreased in HOMA-IR, p < 0.05) is also observed.Dietary-supplemented palmitoleate reduces atherosclerosis development in LDLR-KO mice, and is associated with improvement of lipid and glucose metabolism and favorable changes in regulatory genes involved in lipogenesis and .

These risk factors include but are not limited to obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD), dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Since the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome has multiple metabolic origins, there is no single treatment for it. Pharmacological approaches consist of separate drugs which target at individual risk factors which pose various side effects. Functional foods or nutraceuticals which have potentially important anti-obesity properties have thus attracted great attention. Schisandrae Fructus is a Chinese herb traditionally used as a liver tonic. Silymarin, an extract of the milk thistle (Silybum marianum), is a dietary supplement that is widely used in western society for the prevention and treatment of liver problems. Crataegus Fructus (hawthorn) is traditionally used to promote digestion and dissipate food stagnation. Momordica charantia (bitter melon) is traditionally used for treatment of diabetes in Ayurvedic Medicine.We aimed to develop a multi-targeted herbal formula to target on the multiple risk factors of metabolic syndrome using individual herbs. This proposed herbal formula include sylimarin and Schisandrae Fructus, for NAFLD; Crataegus Fructus for obesity and hyperlipidemia; and Momordica charantia for hyperglycemia.For in vitro study, we carried out insulin-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiation and fluorescent tagged cholesterol-treated Caco-2 cell assay to study for adipogenesis and cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells, respectively. -induced HepG2 cell assay was used to study for -induced fatty liver, and brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) assay was used to study for glucose uptake from the gut. For in vivo study, we performed an 8-week and a 12-week treatment studies, with each study comprising of 4 groups of C57Bl/6 male mice given: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii)-(iv) High-fat diet (contains 21% fat and 0.15% cholesterol). After the initial 8 weeks of normal chow or high-fat diet feeding to induce obesity, animals were given: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii) High-fat diet; (iii) High-fat diet + 2% herbal formula; or (iv) High-fat diet + 4% herbal formula as treatment for another 8 weeks or 12 weeks.Our in vitro results suggested Crataegus Fructus aqueous extract exerted potent inhibitory effects on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiation and cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells. Schisandrae Fructus aqueous extract and milk thistle exerted inhibitory effects on -induced fatty liver in HepG2 cells. Momordica charantia extract on the other hand, exerted significant inhibitory effect on glucose uptake into BBMV. Our in vivo results showed that our herbal formula exhibited a trend to reduce diet-induced increase in body weight and fat pad mass (epididymal, perirenal and inguinal fat); and significantly reduced diet-induced increase in liver weight, liver lipid, and plasma lipid dose-dependently. Besides, high-fat diet induced a significant reduction in adiponectin level which was significantly improved by herbal formula supplementation at 4%. There was however no significant effect of the herbal formula on diet-induced increase in plasma glucose or insulin levels at either dose. Herbal formula also significantly reduced diet-induced  in the liver at both doses.Taken together, these data suggested the potential of our novel multi-targeted herbal formula to be used as a therapeutic agent for diet-induced metabolic syndrome, with special emphasis on NAFLD.Copyright © 2018.

As a lipid droplet-associated protein, Cideb facilitated the export of lipids from enterocytes and promoted intestinal lipid absorption. We found that Cideb was upregulated in the colonic mucosa of both UC patients and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mouse colitis, but its roles in the pathogenesis of UC are still ill-defined.Acute colitis was induced with DSS in Cideb-null and wild-type mice, and the  and oxidative stress were evaluated in the colonic mucosa. Moreover, triglyceride accumulation and oxidative stress were further analyzed in polarized Caco-2 cells with overexpression of Cideb.Our present data indicated that Cideb-null mice were more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis, and consumption of a high-fat diet exacerbated the deterioration of DSS-induced colitis in Cideb-null mice. Moreover, Cideb deficiency increased the colonic oxidative stress in DSS-treated mice and more significant under a high-fat diet condition. In exploring the mechanism, we found that Cideb deficiency elevated the lipid content in both feces and the colonic mucosa of DSS-treated mice, especially those fed with a high-fat diet. The in vitro evidence proved that Cideb expression reduced triglyceride accumulation and oxidative stress in polarized Caco-2 cells in the presence of .Our data suggest that Cideb plays a protective role against the development of UC by reducing the lipid accumulation and oxidative damage in the colonic mucosa.

Although diastolic dysfunction is induced by myocardial ischemia and has been shown to alter the clinical course, the role of coronary artery disease in the diastolic dysfunction and its progression into heart failure has not been completely elucidated.The present study was conducted to identify possible metabolites in coronary artery disease patients that are differentially regulated in patients with diastolic dysfunction.The serum of CAD (n = 75) patients and young healthy volunteers (n = 43) were analysed by using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. Pre-processing of data results in 1547 features; among them 1064 features were annotated using NIST library.Fifteen metabolites were found to be statistically different between cases and control. Variation in metabolites were identified and correlated with several clinically important echocardiography parameters i.e. LVDD grades, ejection fraction (EF) and E/e' values. The results suggested that metabolic products of fatty  oxidation and glucose oxidation pathways such as , stearic , palmitic , linoleic , galactose, pyruvic and lactic acids are predominantly up regulated in patients with coronary artery disease and severity of diastolic dysfunction appears to be linked to increase in fatty  oxidation and . The metabolic fingerprints of these patients give us an insight into the pathophysiological mechanism of diastolic dysfunction in coronary artery disease patients although it did not identify validated novel markers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30186272>Butyrate Protects Mice Against Methionine-Choline-Deficient Diet-Induced Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis by Improving Gut Barrier Function, Attenuating  and Reducing Endotoxin Levels.</a></h2><p>Butyrate exerts protective effects against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We aimed to investigate the role of butyrate-induced gut microbiota and metabolism in NASH development. Sixty-five C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups ( = 15-17 per group) and were fed either a methionine-choline-sufficient (MCS) diet or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet with or without sodium butyrate (SoB; 0.6 g/kg body weight) supplementation for 6 weeks. Liver injury, systematic , and gut barrier function were determined. Fecal microbiome and metabolome were analyzed using 16S rRNA deep sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that butyrate alleviated the MCD diet-induced microbiome dysbiosis, as evidenced by a significantly clustered configuration separate from that of the MCD group and by the depletion of  and  and enrichment of promising probiotic genera , , , , , , and  genera. The fecal metabolomic profile was also substantially improved by butyrate; several butyrate-responsive metabolites involved in lipid metabolism and other pathways, such as stearic , behenic , , linoleic , squalene, and arachidonic , were identified. Correlation analysis of the interaction matrix indicated that the modified gut microbiota and fecal metabolites induced by butyrate were strongly correlated with the alleviation of hepatic injury, fibrosis progression, , and lipid metabolism and intestinal barrier dysfunction. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that butyrate exerts protective effects against NASH development, and these effects may be driven by the protective gut microbiome and metabolome induced by butyrate. This study thus provides new insights into NASH prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29709653> protects saturated fatty  mediated lipotoxicity in hepatocytes and rat of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Aim This study aims to demonstrate the protective effects of monounsaturated  (OA) against saturated palmitic  (PA) induced cellular lipotoxicity in hepatocytes and rats with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).Human hepatoma cell line HepG2 cells and neonatal rat primary hepatocytes were treated with PA or/and OA for 24 h. SD rats were fed with high fat diet (HFD) to induce NASH. From the 16th w, the HFD was full or half replaced by olive oil to observe the protective effects.In vitro, OA substantially alleviated PA induced cellular apoptosis, oxidative stress, ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as  in hepatocytes. In vivo, only olive oil supplementation had no detrimental effects, while HFD developed NASH in normal rats. Full replacement of HFD with olive oil had profoundly reversed NASH. Noteworthily, half replacement of HFD with olive oil (a mixed diet) has ameliorated NASH injury as well. It strikingly changed the hepatic histology from macrovesicular-steatosis into entire microvesicular-steatosis, and significantly reduced , ballooning and fibrosis.Our study has demonstrated in both hepatocytes and NASH rats that  acids had great potential to combat the saturated fatty acids induced hepatic lipotoxicity. Only half replacement of HFD by monounsaturated fatty acids rich diet still had significant therapeutic outcome in NASH rats. Redirecting the toxic saturated fatty acids into triglyceride storage and reduction of cholesterol accumulation might be the possible explanation of OA driven protection in this scenario.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This study sought to investigate variations in genes and hepatic miRNAs in a sample of obese patients with or without NAFLD and human hepatocytes (HH).A total of 60 non-consecutive obese women following bariatric surgery were recruited. Subjects were classified as NAFLD (n=17), borderline (n=24) and controls (n=19) with normal enzymatic profile, liver histology and ultrasound assessments. Profiling of 744 miRNAs was performed in 8 obese women with no sign of hepatic disease and 11 NAFLD patients. Additional validation and expression of genes related to de novo fatty  (FA) biosynthesis, uptake, transport and β-oxidation; glucose metabolism, and  was tested in the extended sample. Induction of NAFLD-related genes and miRNAs was examined in HepG2 cells and primary HH treated with palmitic  (PA), a combination of palmitate and , or high glucose, and insulin (HG) mimicking insulin resistance in NAFLD.In the discovery sample, 14 miRNAs were associated with NAFLD. Analyses in the extended sample confirmed decreased miR-139-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-122-5p and miR-422a, and increased miR-146b-5p in obese subjects with NAFLD. Multiple linear regression analyses disclosed that NAFLD contributed independently to explain miR-139-5p (P=0.005), miR-30b-5p (P=0.005), miR-122-5p (P=0.021), miR-422a (P=0.007) and miR-146a (P=0.033) expression variance after controlling for confounders. Decreased miR-122-5p in liver was associated with impaired FA usage. Expression of inflammatory and macrophage-related genes was opposite to decreased miR-30b-5p, miR-139-5p and miR-422a, whereas increased miR-146b-5p was associated with FABP4 and decreased glucose metabolism and FA mobilization. In partial agreement, PA (but not HG) led to decreased miR-139-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-422a and miR-146a in vitro, in parallel with increased lipogenesis and FA transport, decreased glucose metabolism and diminished FA oxidation.This study confirms decreased liver glucose and lipid metabolism but increased FA biosynthesis coupled with changes in five unique miRNAs in obese patients with NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031397>Modulation of the biomarkers of  and oxidative stress by ruminant trans fatty acids and dairy proteins in vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC).</a></h2><p>This study aimed to determine whether dairy macronutrients alter markers of  and oxidative stress in endothelial cells. Human endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with ruminant trans fatty acids (rTFA), either trans-vaccenic  (tVA) or trans-palmitoleic  (tPA), whey protein hydrolysate, leucine or combinations of rTFA and dairy protein compounds. Industrial TFA elaidic  (EA) was also investigated and compared with rTFA. Inflammatory prostaglandins (PG) and F-isoprostanes (F-isoP) isomers, markers of oxidative stress, were assessed in cell supernatants by LC-MS/MS. Both tVA and tPA, as well as whey protein hydrolysate, decreased TNFα-induced PG excretion. Combinations of rTFA and dairy protein compounds decreased  to a similar extent than rTFA alone. EA increased class VI F-isoP isomers, whereas tVA mostly raised class III isomers. In summary, rTFA decreased inflammatory markers and increased oxidative stress markers in endothelial cells. Combinations of rTFA with whey proteins or leucine showed no additive effect.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Elovl6 is a microsomal enzyme that is responsible for converting C16 saturated and monounsaturated FAs into C18 species. We previously showed that Elovl6 played a critical role in the development of obesity-induced insulin resistance by modifying FA composition. To further define its role in T2D development, we assessed the effects of  deletion in leptin receptor-deficient C57BL/KsJ / mice, a model of T2D. The /; mice had a markedly increased β-cell mass with increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis, an adaptive increase in insulin, and improved glycemic control. / islets were characterized by a prominent elevation of oleate (C18:1n-9), cell stress, and , which was completely suppressed by Elovl6 deletion. As a mechanistic ex vivo experiment, isolated islets from  mice exhibited reduced susceptibility to palmitate-induced , endoplasmic reticulum stress, and β-cell apoptosis. In contrast, oleate-treated islets resulted in impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion with suppressed related genes irrespective of the Elovl6 gene. Taken together, Elovl6 is a fundamental factor linking dysregulated lipid metabolism to β-cell dysfunction, islet , and β-cell apoptosis in T2D, highlighting oleate as the potential culprit of β-cell lipotoxicity.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28391879>Individual omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acids and mortality-The Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health Study.</a></h2><p>The association of polyunsaturated omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids with mortality has been extensively studied. Far less is known about the association of omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acids (omega-9 MUFA) with mortality.We aimed to study the association of individual omega-MUFA with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.Omega-9 MUFA concentrations were measured in erythrocytes in 3259 patients participating in the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health Study using the HS-Omega-3 index method. Associations with mortality were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustment for conventional risk factors separately for men and women.During a median follow-up of 10.0 years, 975 patients (29.9%) died. Partial correlation analysis adjusted for age and gender showed inverse correlations of  (OA), gondoic  (GA), and nervonic  (NA) with LDL-C, HDL-C, and eGFR but direct correlations with markers of  and endothelial activation as well as heart failure. A 1-SD increase in OA, GA, and NA was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality with HRs (95% CI) of 1.08 (1.01-1.16), 1.07 (1.01-1.13), and 1.12 (1.05-1.20), respectively. NA was the only omega-9 MUFA being associated with increased risk in men, whereas in women also GA was associated with risk. The association between OA and mortality seems to be U-shaped with a nadir at a concentration of approx 14%.All three omega-9 MUFA showed direct associations with mortality.

However, there is very little knowledge about the contribution of oxidized linoleic  metabolites in inflammatory pain and peripheral sensitization. Here, we identify 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic  (12,13-DiHOME), a cytochrome P450-derived linoleic  metabolite, as crucial mediator of thermal hyperalgesia during inflammatory pain. We found 12,13-DiHOME in increased concentrations in peripheral nervous tissue during acute zymosan- and complete Freund's Adjuvant-induced inflammatory pain. 12,13-DiHOME causes calcium transients in sensory neurons and sensitizes the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-mediated intracellular calcium increases via protein kinase C, subsequently leading to enhanced TRPV1-dependent CGRP-release from sensory neurons. Peripheral injection of 12,13-DiHOME in vivo causes TRPV1-dependent thermal pain hypersensitivity. Finally, application of the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH)-inhibitor TPPU reduces 12,13-DiHOME concentrations in nervous tissue and reduces zymosan- and CFA-induced thermal hyperalgesia in vivo. In conclusion, we identify a novel role for the lipid mediator 12,13-DiHOME in mediating thermal hyperalgesia during inflammatory pain and propose a novel mechanism that may explain the antihyperalgesic effects of sEH inhibitors in vivo.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

There are, however, few ideal medications for NAFLD, which work by targeting acylcarnitine metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of theacrine, a rare purine alkaloid isolated from Camellia assamica var. kucha, against acylcarnitine metabolism disorder in NAFLD.The pharmacological activities of theacrine were studied using high-fat diet (HFD)-fed ApoE-/- and C57BL/6J mice models. Oleate-treated HepG2 and L-02 cells were used to investigate the molecular mechanism of theacrine on acylcarnitine metabolism. The target of theacrine was confirmed in vitro as the blockade of sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and protein kinase A.Theacrine inhibits hepatic steatosis and liver  and improves energy expenditure in HFD-fed mice. Theacrine ameliorates acylcarnitine metabolism disorder in HFD-fed mice and oleate-treated hepatocytes by improving fatty  oxidation. The underlying mechanism involves theacrine's activation of the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 and consequently, the increased activity of long-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (LCAD) through deacetylation.Theacrine promotes acylcarnitine metabolism in NAFLD through the SIRT3/LCAD signaling pathway. The target of theacrine's activities on NAFLD is identified as SIRT3.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

It is used in the form of Almond-Violet oil in traditional Persian medicine (TPM) since ancient times. Almond-Violet oil was used for the treatment of insomnia, headache, cough, and fever based on TPM textbooks. There are two methods for the preparation of Almond-Violet oil. The first is macerating voila flowers in sweet almond oil for several days under the sunlight. The second method is cold pressing of violet flowers and sweet almond.In this study, after mixing the violet flowers with sweet almonds in 1:2 proportions, Almond-Violet oil was obtained under pressure. Fatty  ingredients of Almond-Violet oil were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) technique.Analysis of Almond-Violet oil by GC method showed some major components such as  (70.54%), linoleic  (Omega-6 fatty acids) (18.22%), palmitic  (8.51%), stearic  (1.58%), and palmitoleic  (0.69%). Monounsaturated fat consumption has been considered to decrease low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Linoleic  lipid radicals can also be used to act as an antioxidant agent in natural phenols.

Dead animals show a massive fatty degeneration of the liver. The cause is still unclear. Previous findings suggest that there may be parallels to human non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The object of the study was to examine the changes in the fat contents, the fatty  composition and the iron content in livers of animals, which have died from hepatic lipidosis.The conspicuous livers (n = 85) were collected from 20 flocks where the phenomenon of massive increased animal losses accompanied by marked macroscopically visible pathological liver steatosis suddenly occurred. For comparison and as a reference, livers (n = 16) of two healthy flocks were taken. Healthy and diseased flocks were fed identical diets concerning official nutrient recommendations and were operating under standardized, comparable conventional conditions.Compared to livers of healthy animals, in the livers of turkeys died from hepatic lipidosis there were found massively increased fat levels (130 ± 33.2 vs. 324 ± 101 g/kg dry matter-DM). In all fatty livers, different fatty acids concentrations were present in significantly increased concentrations compared to controls (palmitic : 104 g/kg DM, +345%; palmitoleic : 18.0 g/kg DM, + 570%; : 115 g/kg DM, +437%). Fatty acids concentrations relevant for liver metabolism and  were significantly reduced (arachidonic : 2.92 g/kg DM, -66.6%; eicosapentaenoic : 0.141 g/kg DM, -78.3%; docosahexaenoic : 0.227 g/kg DM, -90.4%). The ratio of certain fatty acids to one another between control and case livers changed analogously to liver diseases in humans (e.g.: C18:0/C16:0 - 0.913 against 0.311; C16:1n7/C16:0 - 0.090 against 0.165; C18:1/C18:0 - 0.938 against 4.03). The iron content in the liver tissue also increased massively (271 ± 51.5 vs 712 ± 214 mg/kg DM).The hepatic lipidosis has a massive impact on the lipid content, the lipid composition and the iron content in the liver.

Thereafter, beta cell function was evaluated in vivo using hyperglycaemic clamps or ex vivo in islets isolated from fat-treated rats. We also exposed rat islets to oleate in culture, with or without salicylate and 4(2'-aminoethyl)amino-1,8-dimethylimidazo(1,2-a)quinoxaline; BMS-345541 (BMS, another inhibitor of IKKβ) and evaluated beta cell function in vitro.

Because antioxidants are gaining attention as potent preventive agents for HS, we aimed to investigate anti-lipogenic effects of the antioxidants vitamin C (VC), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and astaxanthin (ATX) using hepatocytes. For this, we established an in vitro model using 1 mM  (OA) and human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells; 10 μM antioxidants were evaluated for their ability to reduce fat accumulation in hepatocytes.

The expression of inflammatory cytokines, including chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL) 1, CXCL2, and TNF-α, in monocytes was evaluated.RIP3KO HF diet fed mice showed a significant gain in body weight, and liver weight, liver to body weight ratio, and liver triglycerides were increased in HF diet fed RIP3KO mice compared to HF diet fed WT mice. RIP3KO primary hepatocytes also had increased intracellular fat droplets compared to WT primary hepatocytes after  treatment. RIP3 overexpression decreased hepatic fat content. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the expression of very-low-density lipoproteins secretion markers (microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, protein disulfide isomerase, and apolipoprotein-B) was significantly suppressed in RIP3KO mice.

Three hours after the injection with OA, the arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO), carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO), and bicarbonate (HCO) levels were analyzed using blood gas analyzer. In addition, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were measured by commercial kits, and pathological changes of lung tissue were examined by HE staining. Finally, the correlations of MPO activity or MDA level with the levels of TNF-α or IL-1β were analyzed by Pearson's correlation analysis.We found decreased PaO levels and the pathological changes of lung tissue of ALI after OA injection. In addition, OA increased the levels of MDA, TNF-α, and IL-1β, as well as MPO activity in lung tissues (P < 0.05). However, after treatment with HSS, all of these changes were alleviated (P < 0.05), and these changes were mitigated when treated with HSS by ip then iv injection (P < 0.05). Furthermore, MDA level and MPO activity were positively correlated with TNF-α and IL-1β levels in the lung tissue, respectively (P < 0.01).HSS attenuated ALI induced by OA in rats and might protect against ALI through selective resistance to oxidation and inhibiting inflammatory infiltration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30814550>Serum Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Correlate with Serum Cytokines and Clinical Disease Activity in Crohn's Disease.</a></h2><p>Crohn's disease (CD) has been associated with an increased consumption of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), while greater intake of n-3 PUFA has been associated with a reduced risk. We sought to investigate serum fatty  composition in CD, and associations of fatty acids with disease activity, cytokines, and adipokines. Serum was prospectively collected from 116 CD subjects and 27 non-IBD controls. Clinical disease activity was assessed by the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI). Serum fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography. Serum cytokines and adipokines were measured by Luminex assay. Dietary histories were obtained from a subset of patients. Nine serum cytokines and adipokines were increased in CD versus controls. CD subjects had increased percentage serum monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), dihomo-gamma linolenic  (DGLA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and , but decreased arachidonic  (AA) versus controls. The % total n-3 fatty acids and % EPA directly correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and HBI, whereas the % total n-6 fatty acids were inversely correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and HBI. CD subjects had increased caloric intake versus controls, but no alterations in total fat or PUFA intake. We found differences in serum fatty acids, most notably PUFA, in CD that correlated both with clinical disease activity and inflammatory cytokines. Our findings indicate that altered fatty  metabolism or utilization is present in CD and is related to disease activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30519364> is a novel hypothalamic gene upregulated by a high-fat diet and leptin in mice.</a></h2><p>Energy homeostasis is regulated by the hypothalamus but fails when animals are fed a high-fat diet (HFD), and leptin insensitivity and obesity develops.

In situ hybridisation showed  expression upregulation by HFD and leptin in all major hypothalamic nuclei in agreement with transcriptomic gene expression data.

We investigated the effects of select fatty acids on the expression of genes involved in immediate early as well as inflammatory and hypertrophic responses in adult rat cardiomyocytes. Cardiac remodeling begins with upregulation of immediate early genes for c-fos and c-jun, followed by upregulation of inflammatory genes for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT). At later stages, genes involved in hypertrophic responses, such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), are upregulated. Adult rat cardiomyocytes were treated with palmitic , a saturated fatty ; , a monounsaturated fatty ; linoleic , a polyunsaturated fatty  belonging to the n-6 class; and docosahexaenoic , a polyunsaturated fatty  belonging to the n-3 class. Linoleic  produced a greater increase in the mRNA expression of c-fos, c-jun, NF-κB, NFAT3, ANP, and BNP relative to palmitic  and . In contrast, docosahexaenoic  caused a decrease in the expression of genes involved in cardiac hypertrophy. Our findings suggest that linoleic  may be a potent inducer of genes involved in cardiac hypertrophy, whereas docosahexaenoic  may be protective against the cardiomyocyte hypertrophic response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30538802>Omega-9 , the Main Compound of Olive Oil, Mitigates  during Experimental Sepsis.</a></h2><p>The Mediterranean diet, rich in olive oil, is beneficial, reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Olive oil is mostly composed of the monounsaturated fatty  omega-9. We showed omega-9 protects septic mice modulating lipid metabolism. Sepsis is initiated by the host response to infection with organ damage, increased plasma free fatty acids, high levels of cortisol, massive cytokine production, leukocyte activation, and endothelial dysfunction. We aimed to analyze the effect of omega-9 supplementation on corticosteroid unbalance, , bacterial elimination, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma expression, an omega-9 receptor and inflammatory modulator. We treated mice for 14 days with omega-9 and induced sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). We measured systemic corticosterone levels, cytokine production, leukocyte and bacterial counts in the peritoneum, and the expression of PPAR gamma in both liver and adipose tissues during experimental sepsis. We further studied omega-9 effects on leukocyte rolling in mouse cremaster muscle-inflamed postcapillary venules and in the cerebral microcirculation of septic mice. Here, we demonstrate that omega-9 treatment is associated with increased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and decreased levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-1 in peritoneal lavage fluid of mice with sepsis. Omega-9 treatment also decreased systemic corticosterone levels. Neutrophil migration from circulation to the peritoneal cavity and leukocyte rolling on the endothelium were decreased by omega-9 treatment. Omega-9 also decreased bacterial load in the peritoneal lavage and restored liver and adipose tissue PPAR gamma expression in septic animals. Our data suggest a beneficial anti-inflammatory role of omega-9 in sepsis, mitigating leukocyte rolling and leukocyte influx, balancing cytokine production, and controlling bacterial growth possibly through a PPAR gamma expression-dependent mechanism. The significant reduction of  detected after omega-9 enteral injection can further contribute to the already known beneficial properties facilitated by unsaturated fatty -enriched diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30487558>Extra virgin olive oil: More than a healthy fat.</a></h2><p>The beneficial effects of a Mediterranean diet on human health and, in particular, on lowering risk of cardiovascular disease, has been mainly attributed to its high content to extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). While its main fatty , , is considered important to these effects, EVOO has other biological properties that depend on, or are potentiated by other minor components of this oil. Initially, the mechanisms considered as possible causes of this cardioprotective effect of EVOO were based on the incidence on the so-called traditional risk factors (especially lipids and blood pressure). However, the high relative reduction in the prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were not proportional to the limited findings about regulation of those traditional risk factors. In addition to several studies confirming the above effects, current research on beneficial effect of EVOO, and in particular in conjunction with Mediterranean style diets, is being focused on defining its effects on newer cardiovascular risk factors, such as , oxidative stress, coagulation, platelet aggregation, fibrinolysis, endothelial function or lipids or on the modulation of the conditions which predispose people to cardiovascular events, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the current review, we will mainly focus on reviewing the current evidence about the effects that EVOO exerts on alternative factors, including postprandial lipemia or coagulation, among others, discussing the underlying mechanism by which it exerts its effect, as well as providing a short review on future directions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27653593>Gene Expression Patterns Are Altered in Athymic Mice and Metabolic Syndrome Factors Are Reduced in C57BL/6J Mice Fed High-Fat Diets Supplemented with Soy Isoflavones.</a></h2><p>Soy isoflavones exert beneficial health effects; however, their potential to ameliorate conditions associated with the metabolic syndrome (MetS) has not been studied in detail. In vitro and in vivo models were used to determine the effect of isoflavones on lipid metabolism, , and oxidative stress. In nude mice, consumption of Novasoy (NS) increased cholesterol and lipid metabolism gene expression, including Scd-1 (27.7-fold), Cyp4a14 (35.2-fold), and Cyp4a10 (9.5-fold), and reduced anti-inflammatory genes, including Cebpd (16.4-fold). A high-fat (HF) diet containing 0.4% (w/w) NS for 10 weeks significantly reduced percent weight gain (74.6 ± 2.5 vs 68.6 ± 3.5%) and hepatic lipid accumulation (20 ± 1.2 vs 27 ± 1.5%), compared to HF alone (p < 0.05) in C57BL/6J mice. NS also increased lipid oxidation and antioxidant gene expression while decreasing inflammatory cytokines.

Aqueous suspensions of both solids at pH 7.4 showed negligible payload release whereas a marked delivery was observed in the presence of sodium dithionite due to the rupture of the azo bonds. Besides, a moderate cargo release was observed at acidic pH due to the hydrolysis of the urea bonds that linked the azo derivative onto the external surface of the inorganic scaffolds. In vitro digestion models showed that S1 and S2 microparticles could be used for the controlled release of payload in the reducing colon environment (in which azoreductase enzymes are present). On the other hand, in vivo pharmacokinetic studies in rats showed that safranine O release from S1 microparticles was concentrated in colon. The performance of S2 microparticles for the treatment of colitis in rats (induced by oral administration of a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  solution) was tested. The controlled release of hydrocortisone from S2 in the colon of injured rats induced marked reduction in colon/body weight ratio and in clinical activity score. Also, histological studies showed a marked decrease in  followed by intensive regeneration and almost normal mucosal structure of the individuals treated with S2. Besides, the use of a magnetic belt increased the therapeutic performances of S2 due to an enhanced retention time of the particles in the colon.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Seeking the initiating events, we tested the hypothesis that the intestine could be damaged by repeated lipid supply and therefore participate in inflammation. In mice, 1-5 palm oil gavages increased intestinal permeability via decreased expression and mislocalization of junctional proteins at the cell-cell contacts; altered the intestinal bacterial species by decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria, and Clostridium leptum; and increased inflammatory cytokine expression. This was further studied in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2/TC7 cells using the two main components of palm oil, i.e., palmitic and . Saturated palmitic  impaired paracellular permeability and junctional protein localization, and induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the cells, but unsaturated  did not. Inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis prevented part of these effects. Altogether, our data show that short exposure to palm oil or palmitic  induces intestinal dysfunctions targeting barrier integrity and inflammation. Excessive palm oil consumption could be an early player in the  alterations observed in metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019.

However, the lipid mediators involved and their cellular targets have not been identified. Mice lacking Pla2g5 showed markedly reduced lung ILC2 activation and eosinophilia following repetitive Alternaria Alternata inhalation. While Pla2g5-null mice had Wt levels of immediate IL-33 release after one Alternaria dose, they failed to upregulate IL-33 in macrophages following repeated Alternaria administration. Unexpectedly, while adoptive transfer of bone marrow-derived (BM)-macrophages restored ILC2 activation and eosinophilia in Alternaria-exposed Pla2g5-null mice, exogenous IL-33 did not. Conversely, transfers of Pla2g5-null BM-macrophages reduced  in Alternaria-exposed Wt mice. Mass spectrometry analysis of free fatty acids (FFAs) demonstrated significantly reduced FFAs (including linoleic  (LA) and  (OA)) in lung and BM-macrophages lacking Pla2g5. Exogenous administration of LA or LA+OA to Wt mice sharply potentiated IL-33-induced lung eosinophilia and ILC2 expansion in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, OA potentiated IL-33-induced  and ILC2 expansion in Pla2g5-null mice, but LA was inactive both in vivo and in vitro. Notably, Pla2g5-null ILC2s showed significantly reduced expression of the FFA-receptor-1 compared to Wt ILC2s. Thus, macrophage-associated Pla2g5 contributes significantly to type-2 immunity through regulation of IL-33 induction and FFA-driven ILC2 activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27845265>The effects of herbal composition Gambigyeongsinhwan (4) on hepatic steatosis and  in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty rats and HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Hepatic steatosis has risen rapidly in parallel with a dramatic increase in obesity.

GGH(4) increased mRNA levels of fatty  oxidation enzymes (ACOX, HD, CPT-1, and MCAD) and decreased mRNA levels of lipogenesis genes (FAS, ACC1, C/EBPα, and SREBP-1c) in the liver of OLETF rats. In addition, infiltration of inflammatory cells and expression of inflammatory cytokines (CD68, TNFα, and MCP-1) in liver tissue were reduced by GGH(4). Treatment of HepG2 cells with a mixture of  and palmitoleic  induced significant lipid accumulation, but GGH(4) inhibited lipid accumulation by regulating the expression of hepatic fatty  oxidation and lipogenic genes. GGH(4) also increased PPARα reporter gene expression. These effects of GGH(4) were similar to those of the PPARα activator fenofibrate, whereas the PPARα antagonist GW6471 reversed the inhibitory effects of GGH(4) on lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells.These results suggest that GGH(4) inhibits obesity-induced hepatic steatosis and that this process may be mediated by regulation of the expression of PPARα target genes and lipogenic genes.

Unsaturated fatty acids have a certain protective effect against oxidative damage. The present study used an animal model to determine the protective effect of silkworm pupa oil on hydrochloric  / ethanol-induced gastric ulcer.Silkworm pupa oil is rich in unsaturated fatty acids, including palmitoleic  63.4 g kg ,  249.1 g kg , linoleic  47.0 g kg , and linolenic  337.8 g kg , whereas its unsaturated fatty  content is 700 g kg . Compared to a gastric ulcer control group, high and low doses of pupa oil reduced gastric ulcer area and gastric secretion, whereas gastric pH increased.

In the current study, we investigated the effects of PCW extract on hepatic steatosis under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a mixture of HepG2 cells treated with free fatty  (FFA)-palmitic and -and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice were used; in this background, the triglyceride (TG) levels in HepG2 cells and mice liver were measured, and the expression levels of genes associated with lipogenesis, fatty  oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy were determined. Treatment of HepG2 cells with FFA enhanced intracellular TG levels in HepG2 cells, but co-treatment with PCW significantly attenuated the TG levels. Notably, PCW significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. PCW downregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes, but upregulated the expression of genes associated with fatty  oxidation. Further, PCW inhibited FFA-induced expression of ER stress markers and induced autophagy proteins. However, inhibition of AMPK significantly attenuated the beneficial effects of PCW in HepG2 cells. Moreover, PCW efficiently decreased HFD-induced hepatic TG accumulation in vivo and increased the phosphorylation of hepatic AMPK. Three compounds present in PCW including poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol, significantly decreased FFA-induced increase in intracellular TG levels, consistent with increased AMPK phosphorylation, suggesting that poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol are responsible for PCW-mediated amelioration of hepatic steatosis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PCW ameliorates hepatic steatosis through the regulation of lipid metabolism, inhibition of ER stress, and activation of autophagy in an AMPK-dependent manner. This suggested that PCW can be potentially used for the treatment of hepatic steatosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28601320>Protective role of erdosteine pretreatment on -induced acute lung injury.</a></h2><p>Erdosteine is a mucolytic agent with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.

However, only particular subsets of cancer cells are sensitive to approaches that target fatty  metabolism and, in particular, fatty  desaturation. This suggests that many cancer cells contain an unexplored plasticity in their fatty  metabolism. Here we show that some cancer cells can exploit an alternative fatty  desaturation pathway. We identify various cancer cell lines, mouse hepatocellular carcinomas, and primary human liver and lung carcinomas that desaturate palmitate to the unusual fatty  sapienate to support membrane biosynthesis during proliferation. Accordingly, we found that sapienate biosynthesis enables cancer cells to bypass the known fatty  desaturation pathway that is dependent on stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Thus, only by targeting both desaturation pathways is the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of cancer cells that synthesize sapienate impaired. Our discovery explains metabolic plasticity in fatty  desaturation and constitutes an unexplored metabolic rewiring in cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29790117>Regulatory roles of miR-155 and let-7b on the expression of -related genes in THP-1 cells: effects of fatty acids.</a></h2><p>The main aim of this investigation was to study the regulatory roles of let-7b and miR-155-3p on the expression of -associated genes in monocytes, macrophages, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages (AcM). A second goal was to analyze the potential modulatory roles of different fatty acids, including , palmitic, eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and docosahexaenoic (DHA), on the expression of these miRNAs in the three cell types. This hypothesis was tested in human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1), which were differentiated into macrophages with 2-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and further activated with LPS for 24 h. Monocytes, macrophages, and AcM were transfected with a negative control, or mimics for miR-155-3p and miR-let-7b-5p. The expression of both miRNAs and some proinflammatory genes was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Interestingly, let-7b mimic reduced the expression of IL6 and TNF in monocytes, and SERPINE1 expression in LPS-activated macrophages. However, IL6, TNF, and SERPINE1 were upregulated in macrophages by let-7b mimic. IL6 expression was higher in the three types of cells after transfecting with miR-155-3p mimic. Similarly, expression of SERPINE1 was increased by miR-155-3p mimic in monocytes and macrophages. However, TLR4 was downregulated by miR-155-3p in monocytes and macrophages. Regarding the effects of the different fatty acids,  increased the expression of let-7b in macrophages and AcM and also increased the expression of miR-155 in monocytes when compared with DHA but not when compared with non-treated cells. Overall, these results suggest anti- and proinflammatory roles of let-7b and miR-155-3p in THP-1 cells, respectively, although these outcomes are strongly dependent on the cell type.

(OA) was administered orally (@ 5 mg/kg b.wt and 10 mg/kg b.wt) for 21 days before inducing MI. Pre-exposure to OA at higher dose significantly improved the HW/BW ratio, myocardial infarct size, lipid profiles (total cholesterol, HDL-C) and cardiac injury biomarkers (LDH, CK-MB, cardiac troponin-I, MMP-9), thus suggesting its cardio-protective role. The ameliorative potential of the higher dose of OA was further substantiated by its ability to reduce the cardiac oxidative stress as evidenced by significant decrease in lipid peroxidation coupled with increase in superoxide dismutase activity and reduced glutathione level. Significant decrease in heart rate as well as increase in RR and QT intervals in  pre-exposed rats were also observed. OA pre-treatment also reduced the histopathological alterations seen in myocardial injury group rats. The mRNA expression of cardiac UCP-2 gene, a regulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, was significantly increased in  pre-exposure group compared to the ISO-induced myocardial injury group. Thus increase in expression of UCP-2 gene in cardiac tissue seems to be one of the protective measures against myocardial injury.

We hypothesized that the levels of circulating  chlorohydrin might be a useful early prognostic biomarker in acute pancreatitis in humans.In a prospective, multicenter cohort study, plasma samples collected within 24 h after presentation in the emergency room from 59 patients with acute pancreatitis and from 9 healthy subjects were assessed for  chlorohydrin levels.Pancreatitis was mild in 30 patients, moderately severe in 16 and severe in 13.  chlorohydrin levels within 24 h after presentation were significantly higher in patients that later progressed to moderate and severe acute pancreatitis. Using 7.49 nM as the cutoff point,  chlorohydrin distinguished mild from moderately severe-to-severe pancreatitis with high sensitivity/specificity (96.6/90.0%) and positive/negative predictive values (90.3/96.4%). Using 32.40 nM as the cutoff value sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were all 100% for severe acute pancreatitis. It was found to be a better prognostic marker than BISAP score, hematocrit at 48 h, SIRS at admission, persistent SIRS or C-reactive protein at 48 h. chlorohydrin concentration in plasma is elevated in patients with acute pancreatitis on admission and correlates with a high degree with the final severity of the disease, indicating that it has potential to serve as an early prognostic marker for acute pancreatitis severity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315822>Exogenous hydrogen sulfide mitigates NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated  through promoting autophagy via the AMPK-mTOR pathway.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether exogenous hydrogen sulfide (HS) could mitigate NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated  through promoting autophagy via the AMPK-mTOR pathway in L02 cells. L02 cells were stimulated with different concentrations of  (OA), then cell viability and the protein expression of NLRP3 and pro-caspase-1 were detected by MTT and western blot, respectively, to determine appropriate OA concentration in this study. The cells were divided into four groups: the cells in the control group were cultured with RPMI-1640 for 24.5 h; the cells in the OA group were cultured with RPMI-1640 for 0.5 h, then were stimulated with 1.2 mmol/l OA for 24 h; the cells in the NaHS+OA group were pretreated with sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS, a donor of HS) for 0.5 h before exposure to OA for 24 h; and the cells in the NaHS group were treated with NaHS 0.5 h, then were cultured with RPMI-1640 for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells in every group were collected and the protein expression of NLRP3, procaspase-1, cleaved caspase-1, P62, LC3, Beclin1, T-AMPK, P-AMPK, T-mTOR, P-mTOR and the level of IL-1β were detected by western blot and ElISA, respectively. Exogenous HS reduced the level of NLRP3, caspase-1, P62, IL-1β and the ratio of P-mTOR/T-mTOR induced by OA and increased the ratio of LC3 II/I and the protein expression of Beclin1 suppressed by OA. This study demonstrates for the first time that HS might suppress NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated  induced by OA through promoting autophagy via the AMPK-mTOR pathway. It provides a theoretical basis for the further study of the anti-inflammatory mechanism of HS.© 2019.

The aim of this study was to determine the role of high-fat low-cholesterol diets (HFLCDs) rich in SFAs (HFLCD-SFAs), MUFAs (HFLCD-MUFAs) or MUFAs plus omega-3 long-chain PUFAs (HFLCD-PUFAs) on vascular calcification by the modulation of the RANKL/RANK/OPG system in the aortic roots of LepLDLR mice. Animals fed with HFLCD-SFAs had increased weight and a greater atheroma plaque size, calcification, and RANKL/CATHK expression in the aortic root than mice on MUFA-enriched diets, with an increasing OPG expression in the aortic roots of the latter. Our study demonstrates that compared to dietary SFAs, MUFAs from olive oil protect against atherosclerosis by interfering with vascular calcification via the RANKL/RANK/OPG system in the setting of MetS. These findings open opportunities for developing novel nutritional strategies with olive oil as the most important dietary source of MUFAs (notably ) to prevent cardiovascular complications in MetS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29687443>The anti-inflammatory effect of 10-oxo-trans-11-octadecenoic  (KetoC) on RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide.</a></h2><p>There is rapidly developing interest into the role of several anti-inflammatory agents to resolve  in periodontal disease. A bioactive polyunsaturated fatty , 10-oxo-trans-11-octadecenoic  (KetoC), is known to have various beneficial physiological effects; however, the effect of KetoC on  remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of KetoC on RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide, and explored the intracellular mechanism responsible for its anti-inflammatory effects.RAW 264.7 cells were pre-treated with or without KetoC, and then stimulated with or without P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide. Levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Specific antagonists for G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)40 and GPR120 were used to clarify the receptor for KetoC. The intracellular mechanism was investigated using western blotting analysis to separate nuclear and cytosolic NF-κB p65 protein.KetoC (5 μmol/L) was not toxic to RAW 264.7 cells, and significantly reduced the expression of TNFα and IL-6 mRNA and protein, and IL-1β mRNA. No protein production of IL-1β was observed. Additionally, when bound to GPR120, KetoC trended to downregulate nuclear NF-κB p65 protein levels. However, the antagonist for GPR40 failed to diminish the action of KetoC.KetoC suppressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β via NF-κB p65, by binding to its receptor GPR120. KetoC is a promising candidate in future studies as a bioactive anti-inflammatory agent in treating periodontal disease.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We aimed to determine on patients with CAD the relationships between Trans fatty acids (Trans FA) and different CAD associated parameters such as inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters in addition to Gensini score as a vascular severity index.Fatty  profiles were established by gas chromatography from 111 CAD patients compared to 120 age-matched control group. Lipid peroxidation biomarkers, oxidative stress, inflammatory parameters and Gensini score were studied.Our study showed a significant decrease of the antioxidant parameters levels such as erythrocyte glutathione peroxydase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, plasma antioxidant status (FRAP) and thiol (SH) groups in CAD patients. On the other hand, catalase activity, conjugated dienes and malondialdehyde were increased. Plasmatic and erythrocyte Trans FA were also increased in CAD patients compared to controls. Furthermore, divergent associations of these Trans FA accumulations were observed with low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol/ high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C/HDL-C) ratio, Apolipoprotein B (ApoB), lipid peroxidation parameters, high-sensitivity C Reactive Protein (hs-CRP), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and Gensini score. Especially, elaidic  (C18:1 trans 9), trans C18:2 isomers and trans 11 eicosanoic  are correlated with these parameters. Trans FA are also associated with oxidative stress, confirmed by a positive correlation between C20:1 trans 11 and GPx in erythrocytes.High level of Trans FA was highly associated with the induction of , oxidative stress and lipoperoxidation which appear to be based on the vascular severity and might be of interest to assess the stage and progression of atherosclerosis.

Their topical application in eye drops to deliver fatty  (FA) directly to the ocular surface requires thorough investigation. Being lipids in nature EFAs can interact with tear lipids and affect tear stability. This study aimed at investigating the biophysical interactions of EFAs with Meibomian lipids.Rheology of mixtures of Human Meibomian lipids with EFAs (LA-linoleic , ALA-alpha-linolenic ), OA (), and GLA (gamma-linolenic ) was studied using Langmuir trough technology on an artificial tear solution at the ocular surface temperature. Pressure-area profiles were used to determine compressibility and elasticity of the mixed films.LA enhanced spreading of Meibomian lipids and increased their compressibility and elasticity which can be beneficial for tear stability. ALA condensed Meibomian lipids film with less elasticity deemed unfavourable for tear stability. OA expanded Meibomian lipids but decreased elasticity at high compressions making films less stable. GLA had little or no favourable effect on tear stability. Higher concentrations of FAs made films less stable.EFAs or OA in topical ophthalmic preparations can affect spread and stability of the tear film lipid layer. Rheology of mixed films should be tested using Langmuir trough technology to determine suitable type and amount of a lipid additive for therapeutic eye drops. In topical applications, the omega-6 LA (not omega-3 FA) at low concentrations (20 mol%) can be beneficial for enhancing tear stability in dry eye patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

HYA feeding decreased TNF-α and increased claudin-1, a tight junction protein, levels in the mouse skin. Cytokine expression levels in the skin and intestinal Peyer's patches cells suggested that HYA improved the Th1/Th2 balance in mice. Immunoglobulin A concentration in the feces of the HYA-fed mice was approximately four times higher than that in the control mice. Finally, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the PCR-amplified 16 S rRNA gene of fecal microbes indicated the modification of microbiota by HYA.

Recent studies have indicated that the pomegranate (Punica granatum) seed oil (PSO) has many biologically active components that help in controlling diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. However, its impact on the adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HADMSC) remains unclear. Here we have attempted to study the anti-obesity potential of SHAMstat3pg, a fatty  composite extracted from PSO. It is composed of three dietary fatty acids: punicic  [(9Z,11E,13Z)-9,11,13-Octadecatrienoic ],  [Cis-9-Octadecenoic ], and linoleic  [(9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dienoic ]. In this study, we discuss the impact of the fatty acids on adipogenesis, , glucose uptake, and mitochondrial ATP production. The impact of SHAMstat3pg on the expression of various obesity-associated protein and mRNA transcripts in HADMSC was also analyzed. The results indicate that exposure to 10 µg/ml of SHAMstat3pg (24 hr) inhibited adipogenesis of HADMSC, ameliorated , attenuated ATP production, and glucose uptake. Also, the extract favorably regulated the mRNA expression of the studied obesity-associated gene transcripts. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: SHAMstat3pg has the potential to serve as a multi-targeted therapy for the management of obesity. This study demonstrated that the dietary fatty acids inhibited the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes. SHAMstat3pg has also shown to have a favorable impact on the expression of the obesity-linked proteins and genes in HADMSC that are associated with adipogenesis, , satiety, energy intake/expenditure (central and peripheral signaling molecules). The study gives an overview of the vast number of genes impacted by the treatment with SHAMstat3pg paving the way for future studies to demonstrate the exact mode of action of how dietary fatty acids can help manage obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31112599>PPARα/β Activation Alleviates Age-Associated Renal Fibrosis in Sprague Dawley Rats.</a></h2><p>Age-associated renal fibrosis is commonly observed, with a decline in renal function during aging. Although peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α/β (PPARα/β) activation has been shown to exert beneficial effects on age-associated renal changes, its effects on age-associated renal fibrosis have not been investigated yet. Here, we show that the PPARα/β activator, MHY2013, can significantly alter lipid metabolism in renal tubule epithelial cells and attenuate renal fibrosis in aged Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. We found that MHY2013 significantly increased nuclear translocation and activity of PPARα/β in NRK52E renal epithelial cells. Moreover, the enhanced PPARα/β activity increased the expression of fatty  oxidation-associated PPARα/β target genes. In addition, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)- and -induced lipid accumulation and fibrosis-associated gene expression were decreased in NRK52E cells by MHY2013 pretreatment. To evaluate the effects of MHY2013 on age-associated renal fibrosis, aged SD rates were orally administered MHY2013 (1 and 5 mg/kg) daily for 1 month. MHY2013 efficiently increased PPARα/β activation and reduced renal lipid accumulation in aged SD rat kidneys. Furthermore, renal fibrosis was significantly decreased by MHY2013, indicating the importance of renal lipid metabolism in age-associated renal fibrosis. Taken together, our results suggest that activation of PPARα/β signaling during aging prevents age-associated renal fibrosis.© The Author(s) 2019.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the significance of the IL-17A axis in NAFLD and to explore the role of IL-17A in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD in C57BL/6 mice and  (OA)-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Firstly, Consistent upregulation of IL-17A was observed in the HFD-induced steatosis mice but not the normal chow-fed control mice. Administration of IL-17A impaired liver function, aggravated hepatic lipid accumulation by inhibiting fatty  oxidation in the HFD mice. Conversely, inhibition of IL-17A using an anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody (mAb) significantly attenuated HFD-induced liver injury. Furthermore, IL-17A accelerated hepatic steatosis through activation of the JNK-PPARα pathway in the HFD mice and OA-preloaded hepatocytes.The present study demonstrated that a high fat diet induces IL-17A expression, which exacerbates the progression of NAFLD by inhibiting fatty  β-oxidation and promoting the accumulation of triglycerides (TG).Copyright © 2017.

Human leucine zipper protein (LZIP) regulates the expression of genes involved in , cell migration, and stress response. The aim of this study was to determine the regulatory role of LZIP in stress-induced hepatic steatosis. We used a microarray analysis to identify LZIP-induced genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism. LZIP increased the expression of apolipoprotein A-IV (APOA4) mRNA. In the presence of stress inducer, APOA4 promoter analysis was performed, and LZIP-induced lipid accumulation was monitored in mouse primary cells and human tissues. Under Golgi stress conditions, LZIP underwent proteolytic cleavage and was phosphorylated by AKT to protect against proteasome degradation. The stabilized N-terminal LZIP was translocated to the nucleus, where it directly bound to the APOA4 promoter, leading to APOA4 induction. LZIP-induced APOA4 expression resulted in increased absorption of surrounding free fatty acids. LZIP also promoted hepatic steatosis in mouse liver. Both LZIP and APOA4 were highly expressed in human steatosis samples. Our findings indicate that LZIP is a novel modulator of APOA4 expression and hepatic lipid metabolism. LZIP might be a therapeutic target for developing treatment strategies for hepatic steatosis and related metabolic diseases.-Kang, M., Kim, J., An, H.-T., Ko, J.

Recently we reported that one of the serotonin-fatty  conjugates, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA-5-HT), previously found in gut tissue of mouse and pig, attenuates the IL-23-IL-17 signaling axis in LPS-stimulated mice macrophages. However, its presence and effects in humans remained to be elucidated. Here, we report for the first time its identification in human intestinal (colon) tissue, along with a series of related N-acyl serotonins. Furthermore, we tested these fatty  conjugates for their ability to inhibit the release of IL-17 and CCL-20 by stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Serotonin conjugates with palmitic  (PA-5-HT), stearic  (SA-5-HT) and  (OA-5-HT) were detected in higher levels than arachidonoyl serotonin (AA-5-HT) and DHA-5-HT, while eicosapentaenoyl serotonin (EPA-5-HT) could not be quantified. Among these, DHA-5-HT was the most potent in inhibiting IL-17 and CCL-20, typical Th17 pro-inflammatory mediators, by Concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated human PBMCs. These results underline the idea that DHA-5-HT is a gut-specific endogenously produced mediator with the capacity to modulate the IL-17/Th17 signaling response.

Nutritional priming of central  and its role in ghrelin sensitivity during fed and fasted states have not been analyzed. The current study aims to identify the effect of maternal programming on microglia activation and ghrelin-induced activation of hypothalamic neurons leading to food intake response. We employed a nutritional programming model exposing female Wistar rats to a cafeteria diet (CAF) from pre-pregnancy to weaning. Food intake in male offspring was determined daily after fasting and subcutaneous injection of ghrelin. Hypothalamic ghrelin sensitivity and microglia activation was evaluated using immunodetection for Iba-1 and c-Fos markers, and Western blot for TBK1 signaling. Release of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1β after stimulation with palmitic, , linoleic , or C6 ceramide in primary microglia culture were quantified using ELISA. We found that programmed offspring by CAF diet exhibits overfeeding after fasting and peripheral ghrelin administration, which correlates with an increase in the hypothalamic Iba-1 microglia marker and c-Fos cell activation. Additionally, in contrast to , linoleic, or C6 ceramide stimulation in primary microglia culture, stimulation with palmitic  for 24 h promotes TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1β release and TBK1 activation. Notably, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) palmitic  or LPS inoculation for five days promotes daily increase in food intake and food consumption after ghrelin administration.

Importantly, there are currently no approved treatments available for NAFLD. This study aims to investigate the potential applications of sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) on improving the NAFLD condition using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. The results showed that STS markedly inhibited lipid accumulation in  (OA) and palmitic  (PA) treated HepG2 and primary immortalized human hepatic (PIH) cells. STS suppressed lipogenesis by inhibiting expression of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), fatty  synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). In addition, STS reduced  in cells treated with OA-PA, shown by decreased transcriptional levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) and interleukin 1 beta (IL1B). Consistently, protective effects on hepatic steatosis in db/db mice were observed after STS administration, demonstrated by decreased lipid accumulation in mouse hepatocytes. This protective effect might be associated with STS induced activation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/protein kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha 1 (PRKAA1) pathways.

Recently, we reported that nitro-fatty acids (NO-FAs), products of metabolic and inflammatory reactions of nitric oxide and nitrite, modulate macrophage and other immune cell functions. Bone marrow cell suspensions were isolated from mice and supplemented with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in combination with NO-OA for different times. RAW 264.7 macrophages were used for short-term (1-5min) experiments. We discovered that NO-OA reduces cell numbers, cell colony formation, and proliferation of macrophages differentiated with colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), all in the absence of toxicity. In a case of GM-CSF-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), NO-OA acts via downregulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. In the case of M-CSF-induced BMMs, NO-OA decreases activation of M-CSFR and activation of related PI3K and ERK. Additionally, NO-OA also attenuates activation of BMMs. In aggregate, we demonstrate that NO-OA regulates the process of macrophage differentiation and that NO-FAs represent a promising therapeutic tool in the treatment of inflammatory pathologies linked with increased accumulation of macrophages in inflamed tissues.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Previous phytochemical studies showed that O. japonicus contained compounds with anti-inflammatory activity. The aim of this study was to identify and isolate compounds with anti-inflammatory activity from the rhizome of O. japonicas.Compounds were isolated by various column chromatography and their structures were identified in terms of nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum (NMR) and mass spectrum (MS). To measure the anti-inflammatory effects of thirteen compounds in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells, we used the following methods: cell viability assay, nitric oxide assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative real-time PCR analysis and western blotting analysis.One new and twelve known compounds (mainly homoisoflavonoids) were extracted from O. japonicas, in which 4'-O-Demethylophiopogonanone E (10) was considered as a new compound, additionally, compounds 4-O-(2-Hydroxy-1- hydroxymethylethyl)-dihydroconiferyl alcohol (2) and 5,7-dihydroxy-6-methyl-3-(2', 4'-dihydroxybenzyl) chroman-4-one (12) were isolated from the rhizome of O. japonicas for the first time.

Further analysis elucidated that the anti-inflammatory activity of compound 10 might be exerted through inhibiting the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK in MAPK signaling pathways to decrease NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines production.Our results indicated that 4'-O-Demethylophiopogonanone E can be considered as a potential source of therapeutic medicine for inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29653264>Helminth infection in mice improves insulin sensitivity via modulation of gut microbiota and fatty  metabolism.</a></h2><p>Intestinal helminths are prevalent in individuals who live in rural areas of developing countries, where obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome are rare. In the present study, we analyzed the modulation of the gut microbiota in mice infected with the helminth Strongyloides venezuelensis, and fed either a standard rodent chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD). To investigate the effects of the microbiota modulation on the metabolism, we analyzed the expression of tight-junction proteins present in the gut epithelium, inflammatory markers in the serum and tissue and quantified glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and resistance. Additionally, the levels of lipids related to  were evaluated in the feces and serum. Our results show that infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis results in a modification of the gut microbiota, most notably by increasing Lactobacillus spp. These modifications in the microbiota alter the host metabolism by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, switching macrophages from a M1 to M2 pattern in the adipose tissue, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins in the intestinal cells (thereby reducing the permeability) and decreasing LPS in the serum. Taken together, these changes correlate with improved insulin signaling and sensitivity, which could also be achieved with HFD mice treated with probiotics. Additionally, helminth infected mice produce higher levels of , which participates in anti-inflammatory pathways. These results suggest that modulation of the microbiota by helminth infection or probiotic treatment causes a reduction in subclinical , which has a positive effect on the glucose metabolism of the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

As major cellular dysfunctions are induced by 7KC, it is important to identify molecules able to impair its side effects. Since consumption of olive and argan oils, and fish is important in the Mediterranean diet, the aim of the study was to determine the ability of  (OA), a major compound of olive and argan oil, and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) present in fatty fishes, such as sardines, to attenuate 7KC-induced cytotoxic effects. Since elaidic  (EA), the trans isomer of OA, can be found in hydrogenated cooking oils and fried foods, its effects on 7KC-induced cytotoxicity were also determined. In murine microglial BV-2 cells, 7KC induces cell growth inhibition, mitochondrial dysfunctions, reactive oxygen species overproduction and lipid peroxidation, increased plasma membrane permeability and fluidity, nuclei condensation and/or fragmentation and caspase-3 activation, which are apoptotic characteristics, and an increased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, which is a criterion of autophagy. 7KC is therefore a potent inducer of oxiapoptophagy (OXIdation+APOPTOsis+autoPHAGY) on BV-2 cells. OA and EA, but not DHA, also favor the accumulation of lipid droplets revealed with Masson's trichrome, Oil Red O, and Nile Red staining. The cytotoxicity of 7KC was strongly attenuated by OA and DHA. Protective effects were also observed with EA. However, 7KC-induced caspase-3 activation was less attenuated with EA. Different effects of OA and EA on autophagy were also observed. In addition, EA (but not OA) increased plasma membrane fluidity, and only OA (but not EA) was able to prevent the 7KC-induced increase in plasma membrane fluidity. Thus, in BV-2 microglial cells, the principal fatty acids of the Mediterranean diet (OA, DHA) were able to attenuate the major toxic effects of 7KC, thus reinforcing the interest of natural compounds present in the Mediterranean diet to prevent the development of neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

They manifest alterations in different biological functions. According to our original phylogenetic theory of general pathology, atherosclerosis is associated with altered biological function of trophology, eating, biological reaction of exotrophy. Atherosclerosis is induced by eating of nonoptimal for phylogenetically herbivorous Homo sapiens meat diet with high content of palmitic saturated fatty  (SFA), which leads to in vivo formation of phylogenetically early low-efficient palmitic pathway of FA metabolism instead of highly-efficient  pathway operating in herbivores. Accumulation of nonligand palmitic very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) in the bloodstream results from nonphysiological reaction of compensation upon transport of palmitic SFA to cells. An increase in blood content of palmitic triglycerides (TG) and nonligand palmitic VLDLЛ→LDL coincides with the development of hypercholesterolemia: type IV→ type IIb → type V. Atheromatosis compensates changes in lipoproteins by activation of the biological function of endoecology (purity of the extracellular medium) in vivo, thus fulfilling the biological reaction of . This is physiological denaturation of apoВ-100 in nonligand VLDL→LDL by neutrophils via peroxidation, opsonization by the complement components, transcytosis across the endothelial monolayer and removal to the intima of elastic arteries that serves as a collection and utilization pool for phogogens from local intravascular pool of the intercellular medium. Endogenous phlogogens are utilized by phylogenetically early polyfunctional resident macrophages which are small in number and do not proliferate. Blood-borne monocytes-macrophages are also involved in this process, however, they do not express  hydrolase of polyenic cholesteryl esters. Atheromatous masses are partially catabolized polyenic FA esterified by the alcohol cholesterol which were not internalized by cells. Atheromatosis is a process of pathological compensation in the realization of the function of endoecology. Prevention of atherosclerosis and atheromatosis should be based on elimination of the effects produced by a nonphysiological meat diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298157>Profile of Fatty Acids, Tocopherols, Phytosterols and Polyphenols in Mediterranean Oils (Argan Oils, Olive Oils, Milk Thistle Seed Oils and Nigella Seed Oil) and Evaluation of their Antioxidant and Cytoprotective Activities.</a></h2><p>The effects of vegetable oils on human health depend on their components.

The tocopherol profile showed that Agadir AO contained the highest amount of α-tocopherol, also present at high level in MTSO and Tunisian OO; Berkane AO was rich in γ-tocopherol. The phytosterol profile indicated that β-sitosterol was predominant in the oils, except AO; spinasterol was only present in AO. Polyphenol profiles underlined that OO was the richest in polyphenols; hydroxytyrosol was only found in OO; few polyphenols were detected in AO. The oils studied have antioxidant activities, and all of them, except NSO, prevented 7KC-induced cell death. The antioxidant characteristics of AO were positively correlated with procatechic  and compestanol levels.Based on their biochemical profiles, antioxidant and cytoprotective characteristics, AO, OO, and MTSO are potentially beneficial to human health.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30248539>Effect of silibinin on CFLAR-JNK pathway in -treated HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Silibinin is a flavonolignan from milk thistle with many pharmacological activities including lipid-lowering and antioxidant.

Compared to OA-treated HepG2 cells, silibinin treatment could improve the indicators as follows: (1) decreased the intracellular levels of TG and NO; (2) down-regulated the protein expression of SREBP-1C, PNPLA3, pJNK, CYP 2E1 and CYP 4A; (3) increased the uptake of 2-NBDG; (4) up-regulated the protein expression of CFLAR, PPARα, PI3K, pAKT and NRF2.Silibinin can ameliorate some metabolic alterations and induce some molecular changes by activating the CFLAR-JNK pathway and thereby regulating its downstream target genes involved in lipid metabolism (PPARα, SREBP-1C and PNPLA3), glucose uptake (PI3K-AKT), oxidative stress (NRF2, CYP2E1, CYP4A) and inflammatory response(NO) in OA-treated HepG2 cells demonstrating its possible use in ameliorating various symptoms of NASH.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Using Mendelian randomisation (MR), we sought to evaluate associations between polyunsaturated (PUFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and saturated FAs (SFAs) and CRC risk.We analysed genotype data on 9254 CRC cases and 18,386 controls of European ancestry. Externally weighted polygenic risk scores were generated and used to evaluate associations with CRC per one standard deviation increase in genetically defined plasma FA levels.Risk reduction was observed for  and palmitoleic MUFAs (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.65-0.92, P = 3.9 × 10; OR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.15-0.84, P = 0.018). PUFAs linoleic and arachidonic  had negative and positive associations with CRC respectively (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.93-0.98, P = 3.7 × 10; OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02-1.07, P = 1.7 × 10). The SFA stearic  was associated with increased CRC risk (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.01-1.35, P = 0.041).Results from our analysis are broadly consistent with a pro-inflammatory FA profile having a detrimental effect in terms of CRC risk.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

At least in the case of COX-2, the enzyme becomes folded into a stable Eallo/Ecat pair. Some COX inhibitors ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and coxibs) and common fatty acids (FAs) modulate Ecat activity by binding Eallo. However, the interactions and outcomes often differ between isoforms. For example, naproxen directly and completely inhibits COX-1 by binding Ecat but indirectly and incompletely inhibits COX-2 by binding Eallo. Additionally, COX-1 is allosterically inhibited up to 50% by common FAs like palmitic , whereas COX-2 is allosterically activated 2-fold by palmitic . FA binding to Eallo also affects responses to COX inhibitors. Thus, COXs are physiologically and pharmacologically regulated by the FA tone of the milieu in which each operates-COX-1 in the endoplasmic reticulum and COX-2 in the Golgi apparatus. Cross-talk between Eallo and Ecat involves a loop in Eallo immediately downstream of Arg-120. Mutational studies suggest that allosteric modulation requires a direct interaction between the carboxyl group of allosteric effectors and Arg-120 of Eallo; however, structural studies show some allosterically active FAs positioned in COX-2 in a conformation lacking an interaction with Arg-120. Thus, many details about the biological consequences of COX allosterism and how ligand binding to Eallo modulates Ecat remain to be resolved.© 2019 Smith and Malkowski.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29525610>Arctigenin protects against steatosis in WRL68 hepatocytes through activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B and AMP-activated protein kinase pathways.</a></h2><p>Arctigenin (ATG), a lignin extracted from Arctium lappa (L.), exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.

The results revealed that ATG inhibited OA-induced lipid accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and  in WRL68 hepatocytes, as determined using Oil Red O staining, thiobarbituric  reactive substance assay, and  antibody array assays. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that ATG significantly mitigated the expression of acetylcoenzyme A carboxylase 1 and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 and significantly increased the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha. The 40 targets of the Human  Antibody Array indicated that ATG significantly inhibited the elevation of the U937 lymphocyte chemoattractant, ICAM-1, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-6sR, IL-7, and IL-8. ATG could activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways and could increase the phosphorylation levels of Akt and AMPK to mediate cell survival, lipid metabolism, oxidation stress, and .

One of the typical properties of this family, which includes milk thistle (), is the richness of the oil in various compounds (flavonoids, alkaloids, tocopherols, and unsaturated fatty acids). Currently, and for the coming decades, age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, are a major public health problem. Preventing their appearance or opposing their evolution is a major objective. In this context, the cytoprotective activities of milk thistle seed oil produced in Tunisia were studied on the 158N model using 7-ketocholesterol (7KC) and 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S) as cytotoxic agents. 7KC and 24S were used because they can be increased in the brain and body fluids of patients with major age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In order to evaluate the cytoprotective properties of milk thistle seed oil, complementary techniques of microscopy, flow cytometry, and biochemistry were used. The chemical composition of milk thistle seed oil has also been determined by various chromatography techniques. Milk thistle seed oils from different area of Tunisia are rich in tocopherols and are strongly antioxidant according to various biochemical tests (KRL (Kit Radicaux Libres), FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power), and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl)). The main fatty acids are linoleic  (C18:2 n-6) and  (C18:1 n-9). The main polyphenols identified are homovanillic , p-coumaric , quercetin, and apigenin, with a predominance of vanillic . On 158N cells, milk thistle seed oil attenuates the cytotoxicity of 7KC and 24S including: loss of cell adhesion, increased plasma membrane permeability, mitochondrial dysfunction, overproduction of reactive oxygen species, induction of apoptosis, and autophagy. The attenuation of the cytotoxicity of 7KC and 24S observed with the milk thistle seed oil is in the order of that observed with α-tocopherol used as a positive control. In the presence of nigella seed oil, considered potentially cytotoxic, no cytoprotective effects were observed. Given the chemical characteristics, antioxidant properties, and cytoprotective activities of milk thistle seed oil, our results highlight the potential benefit of this oil for human health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27853933>Lipid Rafts Promote trans Fatty -Induced  in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells.</a></h2><p>The effects of two fatty acids,  (OLA) and elaidic  (ELA) on normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and non-rafts HUVEC were investigated in this study. The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines (ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and IL-6) were analyzed. Western blot was used to analyze the expression levels of -related proteins (NF-κB, ERK1/2) and toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4). The results showed that the levels of nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 were significantly decreased only in non-lipid rafts cells pretreated with trans fatty  (TFA). The expression of TLR4 in the ELA-treated normal cells was higher than that in non-lipid rafts HUVEC. When the lipid rafts was destroyed by methyl-β-cyclodextrin, the levels of nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65, phosphorylated ERK1/2 and TLR4 were decreased significantly. Therefore, lipid rafts may be involved in TFA induced- in HUVEC through blocking the inflammatory signal pathway.

In recent years, it has been found that the NLRP3 inflammasome is closely related to inflammatory response. However, there are no reports about the involvement of NLRP3 in PFE- associated ALI. Glibenclamide is a kind of hypoglycaemic drug with anti-inflammatory effect. It has been reported to have the anti-inflammatory effect related to inhibiting NLRP3.  To determine whether NLRP3 inflammasome was involved in ALI induced by PFE or whether glibenclamide had therapeutic effects on such lung injury, we designed this experiment.  The rat model of intravenous injection of  (OA) was used to simulate PFE. Rats were divided into three groups: control, OA and glibenclamide treatment group. Blood free fatty  (FFA) concentration was determined by ACS-ACOD. Histopathological examinations were taken to assess the severity of lung injury. The expression of NLRP3 pathway and its downstream products were analyzed by IHC, WB, qPCR and ELISA.  Four hours after intravenous OA injection, the typical pathological manifestations of ALI accompanied by elevated levels of plasma FFAs were found. The activity of NLRP3 inflammasomes increased in OA group, too. Pretreatment with glibenclamide partly inhibited the increase in NLRP3, caspase-1 and IL-1β expression induced by OA, simultaneously attenuated the lung injury. But it has little effect on the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression in this experiment.  NLRP3 inflammasome, one of the main components of innate immune response, involved in ALI induced by OA. Glibenclamide can alleviate this kind of ALI by inhibiting rather the NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β signaling pathway than the levels of FFAs or TLR4 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616405>Docosahexaenoic  Suppresses Silica-Induced Inflammasome Activation and IL-1 Cytokine Release by Interfering With Priming Signal.</a></h2><p>Occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica (cSiO) has been etiologically linked to human autoimmunity. Intranasal instillation with cSiO triggers profuse inflammation in the lung and onset of autoimmunity in lupus-prone mice; however, dietary supplementation with the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  docosahexaenoic  (DHA) abrogates these responses. Inflammasome activation, IL-1 cytokine release, and death in alveolar macrophages following cSiO exposure are early and critical events that likely contribute to triggering premature autoimmune pathogenesis by this particle. Here we tested the hypothesis that DHA suppresses cSiO-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, IL-1 cytokine release, and cell death in the macrophage. The model used was the murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line stably transfected with the inflammasome adapter protein ASC (RAW-ASC). Following priming with LPS, both the canonical activator nigericin and cSiO elicited robust inflammasome activation in RAW-ASC cells, as reflected by IL-1β release and caspase-1 activation. These responses were greatly diminished or absent in wild-type RAW cells. In contrast to IL-1β, cSiO induced IL-1α release in both RAW-ASC and to a lesser extent in RAW-WT cells after LPS priming. cSiO-driven effects in RAW-ASC cells were confirmed in bone-marrow derived macrophages. Pre-incubating RAW-ASC cells with 10 and 25 μM DHA for 24 h enriched this fatty  in the phospholipids by 15- and 25-fold, respectively, at the expense of . DHA pre-incubation suppressed inflammasome activation and release of IL-1β and IL-1α by nigericin, cSiO, and two other crystals - monosodium urate and alum. DHA's suppressive effects were linked to inhibition of LPS-induced , and  transcription, potentially through the activation of PPARγ. Finally, nigericin-induced death was inflammasome-dependent, indicative of pyroptosis, and could be inhibited by DHA pretreatment. In contrast, cSiO-induced death was inflammasome-independent and not inhibited by DHA. Taken together, these findings indicate that DHA suppresses cSiO-induced inflammasome activation and IL-1 cytokine release in macrophages by acting at the level of priming, but was not protective against cSiO-induced cell death.Copyright © 2019 Wierenga, Wee, Gilley, Rajasinghe, Bates, Gavrilin, Holian and Pestka.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29944935>Nitro-fatty acids: New drug candidates for chronic inflammatory and fibrotic diseases.</a></h2><p>Nitrated  (NO-OA) was first identified in 2003, and after the characterization of its formation and thiol reactivity, it was used as a prototypical molecule to investigate the physiological actions of endogenous nitrated fatty acids (NO-FA). Based on in vitro observations showing significant activation of cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory signaling responses by NO-FA, experiments were designed to determine their pharmacological potential. Supported by strong intellectual protection and favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, 10-NO-OA (CXA-10) underwent pharmaceutical development as a drug to treat fibrotic and inflammatory diseases. NO-FA are at the intersection of three unconventional drug candidate classes that include 1) fatty acids, 2) metabolic intermediates and 3) electrophilic molecules. These three groups use different scaffolds for drug development, are characterized by broad activities and are individually gaining traction as alternatives to mono-target drug therapies. In particular, NO-FA share key characteristics with currently approved pharmacological agents regarding reactivity, distribution, and mechanism of action. This review first presents the characteristics, liabilities, and opportunities that these different drug candidate classes display, and then discusses these issues in the context of current progress in the preclinical and clinical development of NO-FA as drugs.

Creatine is a small molecule that plays a large role in energy metabolism, but since the enzyme creatine kinase is not present in the liver, the classical role in energy metabolism does not hold in this tissue. Fat accumulation in the liver can lead to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a progressive disease that is prevalent in humans. We have previously reported that creatine can directly influence lipid metabolism in cell culture to promote lipid secretion and oxidation. Our goal in the current study was to determine whether similar mechanisms that occur in cell culture were present in vivo. We also sought to determine whether dietary creatine supplementation could be effective in reversing steatosis. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a high-fat diet or a high-fat diet supplemented with creatine for 5 weeks. We found that rats supplemented with creatine had significantly improved rates of lipoprotein secretion and alterations in mitochondrial function that were consistent with greater oxidative capacity. We also find that introducing creatine into a high-fat diet halted hepatic lipid accumulation in rats with fatty liver. Our results support our previous report that liver cells in culture with creatine secrete and oxidize more , demonstrating that dietary creatine can effectively change hepatic lipid metabolism by increasing lipoprotein secretion and oxidation in vivo. Our data suggest that creatine might be an effective therapy for NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The function of trophology (feeding) is implemented by two biological reactions: exophilia - external feeding and endophilia - internal feeding. The function of endoecology prevents exceeding of upper limit of physiological interval by no substrate, catabolites and endogenous phlogogens. It is implemented by two biological functions: excretion and . The etiological factors of atherosclerosis are the following ones.

In the ocean, all animals were carnivorous (piscivorous); species Homo Sapiens, in millions of years of life on dry land, forcedly became a herbivorousone. The main role in development of herbivorous animals belongs to insulin; the hormone regulating in the first-place metabolism of fatty acids, expresses transmutation of all endogenously synthesized from glucose palmitic saturated fatty  in  monosaturated fatty . The late in phylogenesis insulin can't initiate transmutation of exogenous palmitic saturated fatty  of food into  mono-saturated fatty . Under effect of insulin in vivo an active  type of metabolism of fatty acids is developed; and outside if effect of insulin palmitic type of metabolism of fatty acids is developed. In the ocean, synthesis of active eicosanoids occurs from ῳ-3 polyene fatty acids; there is no such fatty acids in dry land. The basis of pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is feeding of large amount of carnivorous (meat) food by phylogenetically herbivorous Homo Sapiens. This way a deficiency of palmitic saturated fatty acids in cells if developed blocking their bio-accessibility. The lipoproteins of low density are not developed in the initiated by insulin transfer of  triglycerides to cells in  apoE/B-100 lipoproteins of very low density and their absorption by cells. The transfer of triglycerides into lipoproteins of very low density is blocked under slow processes of transmutation of palmitic lipoproteins of very low density into lipoproteins of low density, retention cumulation of lipoproteins of low density in blood. Only because of partial utilization by monocytes of non-ligand palmitic lipoproteins of very low density →lipoproteins of low density that occurs in the intima of arteries of elastic type, atheromotosis is developed.

The aim of this study was to determine the FA profile and pro-antioxidant status in sarcopenic frail elderly patients enrolled in a nutritional and physical activity program and to evaluate their correlation with clinical markers. Moreover, the possible changes, produced after a short-term clinical protocol, were evaluated. Plasma and erythrocyte FA composition and pro-antioxidant status were analyzed in sarcopenic elderly subjects recruited for the randomized clinical study and treated with a placebo or dietary supplement, a personalized diet, and standardized physical activity. Subjects were tested before and after 30 days of treatment. Pearson correlations between biochemical parameters and patients' characteristics at recruitment indicate interesting features of sarcopenic status such as negative correlation among the plasma FA profile, age, and physical characteristics. Physical activity and dietetic program alone for 30 days induced a decrease of saturated FA concentration with a significant increase of dihomo-gamma-linolenic . Supplementation plus physical activity induced a significant decrease of linoleic , omega-6 polyunsaturated FAs, and an increase of stearic and  concentration. Moreover, glutathione reductase activity, which is an indicator of antioxidant status, significantly increased in erythrocytes. Changes over time between groups indicate significant differences for saturated FAs, which suggest that the amino  supplementation restores FA levels that are consumed during physical activity. A relationship between FA and clinical/metabolic status revealed unique correlations and a specific metabolic and lipidomic fingerprint in sarcopenic elderly. The results indicate the positive beneficial role of supplementation and physical activity on plasma FA status and the antioxidant system as a co-adjuvant approach in sarcopenic, frail, elderly patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30461332>Toxicity of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) to THP-1 macrophages: interactions with saturated or unsaturated free fatty acids.</a></h2><p>In a biological microenvironment, free fatty acids (FFA) as ubiquitous biological molecules might interact with nanoparticles (NPs) and consequently change the toxicological responses.

This study investigated the interactions between ZnO NPs and saturated or unsaturated FFA (complexed to BSA), namely stearic  (SA, C18:0),  (OA, C18:1), and α-linolenic  (ALA, C18:3). It was shown that BSA, SA, OA, and ALA increased the atomic force microscope (AFM) heights as well the polydispersity index (PDI) of ZnO NPs. BSA modestly protected THP-1 macrophages from ZnO NP exposure, whereas OA and ALA led to relatively less cyto-protective effects of BSA. Moreover, only co-exposure to ZnO NPs and SA significantly promoted the release of interleukin-8. BSA, SA, OA, and ALA equally changed intracellular ROS and Zn ions associated with ZnO exposure, but co-exposure to ZnO NPs and OA/ALA particularly activated the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-apoptosis genes.

Moreover, the database was also searched for clinical trials investigating strategies to enhance PON1 activity.The studies support decreased PON1 activity as determined using phenylacetate (i.e., arylesterase or AREase) as a substrate, in depression, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and schizophrenia, especially in antipsychotic-free patients. PON1 activity as determined with paraoxon (i.e., POase activity) yields more controversial results, which can be explained by the lack of adjustment for the Q192R polymorphism. The few clinical trials investigating the influence of nutritional, lifestyle and drugs on PON1 activities in the general population suggest that some polyphenols, , Mediterranean diet, no smoking, being physically active and statins may be effective strategies that increase PON1 activity.Lowered PON1 activities appear to be a key component in the ongoing NOS processes that accompany affective disorders, GAD and schizophrenia.

The aim of the randomized, crossover, controlled feeding trial was to examine whether as compared to NCEP step II diet as control (CON), ~60 g/d almonds (ALM) added to CON would improve glucoregulation and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in 33 Chinese T2DM patients.Forty T2DM patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive CON or ALM for 12 wks after a 2-wk. run-in period. Blood and urine samples were collected in the beginning and at the end of each dietary intervention phase for the assessment of biomarkers of glucoregulation, lipid profile, , and oxidative stress.While ALM had a better overall nutritional quality than CON, neither ALM nor CON improved the glycemic status as the primary study outcome and other CVD risk factors, except the circulating nitric oxide being decreased by ALM compared to CON. Among 27 of 33 patients with the baseline HbA1c ≤8, ALM decreased post-interventional fasting serum glucose and HbA1c by 5.9% and 3.0% as compared to that of CON, respectively ( = 0.01 and 0.04). Mean total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations were not changed by both diets.These results suggest almonds incorporated into healthful diets can improve glycemic status in diabetic patients with a better glycemic control., registered 13 January 2012.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30948926>Cx43 Inhibition Attenuates Sepsis-Induced Intestinal Injury via Downregulating ROS Transfer and the Activation of the JNK1/Sirt1/FoxO3a Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>Intestinal injury has long been considered to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of sepsis and has even been characterized as the "motor" of it. Thus, we explored the effects of connexin43 (Cx43) on sepsis-induced intestinal injury in order to provide potential therapeutic strategies. Rat cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) models  and cell models (IEC-6 cells) pretreated with LPS  were used in the current study. Firstly, different methods, such as Cx43 inhibitors (18--GA and oleamide) or siRNA targeting Cx43 and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) (a kind of ROS scavenger), were used to observe the effects of Cx43 channels mediating ROS transfer on intestinal injury. Secondly, the influence of ROS content on the activity of the JNK1/Sirt1/FoxO3a signaling pathway was explored through the application of NAC, sp600125 (a JNK1 inhibitor), and nicotinamide (a Sirt1 inhibitor). Finally, luciferase assays and ChIP were used to determine the direct regulation of FoxO3a on proapoptotic proteins, Bim and Puma. The results showed that sepsis-induced intestinal injury presented a dynamic change, coincident with the alternation of Cx43 expression. The inhibition of Cx43 attenuated CLP-induced intestinal injury  and LPS-induced IEC-6 injury . The changes of Cx43 channel function regulated ROS transfer between the neighboring cells, which mediated the activation of the JNK1/Sirt1/FoxO3a signaling pathway. FoxO3a directly affected its downstream target genes, Bim and Puma, which are responsible for cell or tissue apoptosis. In summary, our results suggest that Cx43 inhibition suppresses ROS transfer and inactivates the JNK1/Sirt1/FoxO3a signaling pathway to protect against sepsis-induced intestinal injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28567492>In vitro modeling of unsaturated free fatty -mediated tissue impairments seen in acne lesions.</a></h2><p>Acne vulgaris is a disease of pilosebaceous units with multifactorial pathogenesis, including hyperkeratinization, increased sebum secretion, and . Recently, it was suggested that acne subjects may have also impaired skin barrier. We hypothesized that excess unsaturated free fatty acids (UFFA) present in the sebum may cause barrier impairment associated with increased follicular stratum corneum (SC) thickening and  seen in acne. Therefore, epidermal and sebaceous lipid profiles from acne and healthy subjects were analyzed and an in vitro epidermal tissue model was developed to validate this hypothesis. Significantly increased levels of free fatty acids (p < 0.05) were observed in skin lipids of human acne vs. healthy subjects. Exposure of human epidermal equivalents (HEEs) to the UFFA  (OA), also present in sebum, led to barrier impairment associated with increased SC lipid disorder, increased secretion of interleukin-1α (IL-1α), and excessive SC thickening. Furthermore, the expression of genes encoding for inflammatory cytokines and epidermal differentiation proteins was also increased both in acne lesions and in OA-treated HEEs. Taken together, these data are in agreement with the hypothesis that excess UFFAs in sebum of acne subjects may contribute to impaired skin barrier associated with the increased follicular SC thickness and  seen in acne. Moreover, OA induces similar molecular and phenotypic changes in HEEs as those seen in acne lesions and suggests that an UFFA-treated epidermal tissue model can be used to study the UFFA-mediated pathways involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory acne and for the development of appropriate therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31394805>Effects of Olive Oil and Its Minor Components on Cardiovascular Diseases, , and Gut Microbiota.</a></h2><p>Olive oil is one of the main ingredients in the Mediterranean diet, being an important ally in disease prevention. Its nutritional composition is comprised of mainly monounsaturated fatty acids, with  being the major , plus minor components which act as effective antioxidants, such as hydroxytyrosol. Studies have shown that the consumption of olive oil, as well as its isolated components or in synergism, can be a primary and secondary protective factor against the development of cardiovascular diseases since it reduces the concentrations of low-density lipoproteins and increases the concentration of high-density lipoproteins. Furthermore, it exerts an influence on the inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor, which are pro-inflammatory agents in the body. The components present in olive oil are also associated with the promotion of intestinal health since they stimulate a higher biodiversity of beneficial gut bacteria, enhancing their balance. The objective of this review is to present recent data on investigated effects of olive oil and its components on the metabolism, focused on cardiovascular diseases, , and gut biota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081527>The Protection Potential of Antioxidant Vitamins Against Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: a Rat Trial.</a></h2><p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a fatal disease that includes  formed by septic and non-septic causes. Reactive oxygen radicals (ROS) play a key role in ARDS pathophysiology and constitute the base of damage process. Antioxidant vitamins are used for inhibiting hazardous effects of radicals. Therefore, effects of antioxidant vitamins such as α-lipoic  (ALA), vitamin E (VITE), and C (VITC) were investigated on  (OA)-induced ARDS rat model. Furthermore, high and low dose of methylprednisolone (HDMP, LDMP) was used for comparing effects of the vitamins. In this study, 42 male rats were divided to seven groups named control, OA, ALA, VITE, VITC, LDMP, and HDMP. OA was intravenously administered to all groups except control group and other compounds were orally administered (ALA, VITE, and VITC: 100 mg/kg, LDMP: 5 mg/kg, HDMP: 50 mg/kg) after OA injections. OA increased MDA level in lung tissue and TNF-α and IL-1β cytokine levels in serum. ALA, VITE, VITC, and both dose of MP significantly decreased the cytokine levels. Although OA reduced SOD, CAT, and GSH levels in lung tissue, the vitamins and LDMP markedly enhanced the levels except for HDMP. Furthermore, OA showed thickening in bronchi and alveolar septum, hyperemia in vessels, and inflammatory cell infiltrations in lung tissue histopathological examinations. Antioxidant vitamins may be useful for premedication of ARDS and similar disorders. However, methylprednisolone was not found sufficient for being a therapeutic agent for ARDS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31278884>Malassezia interaction with a reconstructed human epidermis: Keratinocyte immune response.</a></h2><p>The immediate immune response developed by the keratinocytes against Malassezia yeasts has been addressed yielding conflicting results. This study aims the assessment of cytokines and antimicrobial peptides gene expression elicited by M. sympodialis and M. furfur once in contact with a reconstructed human epidermis. A yeast suspension was prepared in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with Tween 60 and  to obtain approximately 1 × 10 cells in a volume of 100 μL. Clinical isolates of M. sympodialis (from pityriasis versicolor) and M. furfur (from seborrhoeic dermatitis) were inoculated, separately, onto a reconstructed human epidermis. A distinct expression pattern was found between the two tested species, with a tendency for overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines very soon after infection, whereas no significant expression or gene downregulation was often noticed following 24 and 48 h of incubation.

Aging and obesity independently contribute to muscle atrophy that is assumed to be a result of the activation of mutual physiological pathways. Understanding mechanisms contributing to the induction of skeletal muscle atrophy with aging and obesity is important for determining targets that may have pivotal roles in muscle loss in these conditions. We find that aging and obesity equally induce an anabolic resistance to acute skeletal muscle contraction as observed with decreases in anabolic signaling activation after contraction. Furthermore, treatment with the sphingosine-1-phosphate analog FTY720 for 4 wk increased lean mass and strength, and the anabolic signaling response to contraction was improved in obese but not older animals. To determine the role of chronic  and different fatty acids on anabolic resistance in skeletal muscle cells, we overexpressed IKKβ with and without exposure to saturated fatty  (SFA; palmitic ), polyunsaturated fatty  (eicosapentaenoic ), and monounsaturated fatty  (). We found that IKKβ overexpression increased  markers in muscle cells, and this chronic  exacerbated anabolic resistance in response to SFA. Pretreatment with FTY720 reversed the inflammatory effects of palmitic  in the muscle cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate chronic  can induce anabolic resistance, SFA aggravates these effects, and FTY720 can reverse this by decreasing ceramide accumulation in skeletal muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28982243>Solanum nigrum Polyphenol Extracts Inhibit Hepatic , Oxidative Stress, and Lipogenesis in High-Fat-Diet-Treated Mice.</a></h2><p>Patients with diabetes, obesity, and hyperlipidemia are all high-risk groups for fatty liver; however, the mechanism of fatty liver formation is not completely understood. Studies have indicated that abnormal fat metabolism, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance are positively correlated with peroxidation and abnormal cytokine production. Recent studies have revealed that Solanum nigrum extracts (SNE) possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidation, antihyperlipidemia, and liver protection abilities. Therefore, the present study investigated the in vivo and in vitro effects of an SNE on nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)-induced hepatitis. In vivo data demonstrated that the SNE reduced blood triglyceride, sugar, and cholesterol levels, as well as fat accumulation, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation in high-fat-diet-treated mice. The results indicated that the SNE downregulated the expression of fatty  synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and upregulated the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha. Furthermore, we prepared a Solanum nigrum polyphenol extract (SNPE) from the SNE; the SNPE reduced hepatic lipid () accumulation. Therefore, SNE have the potential to alleviate NAFL-induced hepatitis, and polyphenolic compounds are the main components of SNE. Moreover, SNE can be used to develop health-food products for preventing NAFL disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30102465>Palmitoleic  has Stronger Anti-Inflammatory Potential in Human Endothelial Cells Compared to  and Palmitic Acids.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids (FAs) may affect endothelial cell (EC) function, influencing atherogenesis and inflammatory processes. Palmitoleic  (POA) has been described as an anti-inflammatory FA. However, its effects on ECs are underexplored. This study compares the effects of POA with those of palmitic  (PA) and  (OA) on EC inflammatory responses.EAHy926 cells (EC lineage) are exposed to PA, OA, or POA, and stimulated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Associated with the FA's own incorporation, PA induces a twofold increase in arachidonic , while POA increases the amount of cis-vaccenic . PA, but not OA, enhances the production of IL-6 and IL-8 in response to TNF-α. In contrast, POA decreases production of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, IL-6, and IL-8 compared to PA. TNF-α increases surface intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression previously decreased by POA. TNF-α stimulation increases the expression of NFκB, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, MCP-1, and IL-6 genes and reduces the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α gene. PA enhances the expression of MCP-1, IL-6, and COX-2 genes, while POA downregulates these genes, decreases expression of NFκB, and upregulates PPAR-α gene expression.POA has anti-inflammatory effects on ECs stimulated with TNF-α and may counter endothelial dysfunction.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We previously showed that saturated dietary fat induces pancreatic acinar lipotoxicity and cellular stress. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of exocrine pancreas cells is highly developed and thus predisposed to stress. We studied the combination of saturated and unsaturated FAs in metabolic and pancreatitis like cerulein (CER)-induced stress states on cellular ER stress.Exocrine pancreas AR42J and rat primary exocrine acinar cells underwent acute (24 h) challenge with different FAs (saturated, monounsaturated) at different concentrations (250 and 500 µM) and in combination with acute CER-induced stress, and were analyzed for fat accumulation, ER stress unfolded protein response (UPR) and immune and enzyme markers. Acute exposure of AR42J and pancreatic acinar cells to different FAs and their combinations increased triglyceride accumulation. Palmitic  significantly dose-dependently enhanced the UPR, immune factors and pancreatic lipase (PL) levels, as demonstrated by XBP1 splicing and elevation in UPR transcripts and protein levels ( and ). Exposure to high palmitic levels in a CER-induced stress state synergistically increased ER stress and  marker levels. Exposure to  did not induce ER stress and PL levels and significantly decreased immune factors in an acute CER-induced stress state. Combination of  and palmitic acids significantly reduced the palmitic-induced ER stress, but did not affect the immune factor response. We show that combination of monounsaturated and saturated FAs protects from exocrine pancreatic cellular ER stress in both metabolic and CER-induced stress.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28737815>Isofraxidin, a coumarin component improves high-fat diet induced hepatic lipid homeostasis disorder and macrophage  in mice.</a></h2><p>Isofraxidin (IF) is a coumarin compound produced in the functional foods Siberian ginseng and Apium graveolens.

Alterations in triglyceride metabolism,  and oxidative status were monitored. Results show that IF mainly reduced triglyceride accumulation, TNF-α release and ROS activation in metabolic disordered cells. Next, a high-fat diet, which induced a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, was used to evaluate the therapeutic action of IF. Our results show that treatment with IF significantly inhibited the high-fat diet-induced elevation in body weight, liver weight, lipid metabolism (TG, TC and HDL-C) and hepatic injury in mice. In biochemical terms, treatment with IF resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of AMPKα and ACC, as well as reduced hepatic expression of FAS and HMGC, suggesting that lipogenesis was compromised. We also found robust evidence that treatment with IF significantly depleted infiltrating inflammatory cells (F4/80 Kupffer cells and CD68 macrophages) and inflammatory cytokine release (TNFα and IL-6). Moreover, the anti-inflammatory activity in IF-treated hepatic tissue correlated with down-regulation of TLR4 expression and NF-κB transcription. In sum, these results suggest that IF might play a protective role against lipid metabolism disorder induced by a high-fat diet via inhibition of lipid production and  in the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30611468>Identification of hydroxytyrosyl oleate, a derivative of hydroxytyrosol with anti-inflammatory properties, in olive oil by-products.</a></h2><p>Hydroxytyrosyl esters with short, medium and long acyl chains were evaluated for their ability to reduce nitric oxide (NO) production by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Among the compounds tested, C18 esters, namely hydroxytyrosyl stearate (HtySte) and hydroxytyrosyl oleate (HtyOle), were found to decrease NO production in a concentration-dependent manner, while the other compounds, including the parent hydroxytyrosol, were ineffective in the tested concentration range (0.5-5 μM). Further study of the potential immune-modulating properties of HtyOle revealed a significant and concentration-dependent suppression of prostaglandin E production. At a transcriptional level, HtyOle inhibited the expression of inducible NO synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and interleukin-1β. Moreover, HtyOle was identified for the first time in olive oil by-products by means of high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. By contrast, HtyOle was not found in intact olives. Our results suggest that HtyOle is formed during oil processing and represents a significant form in which hydroxytyrosol occurs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

On the other hand, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by excess lipid accumulation, and inflammatory injury in liver, is becoming an epidemic disease, globally. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the biological role and the underlying mechanisms of TREM-1 in NAFLD. upregulation of TREM-1 occurred in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mice NAFLD model and -treated HepG2 and primary mouse hepatocytes cell model at messenger RNA and protein levels. Functional studies established that overexpression of TREM-1 displayed hyperlipidemia, and increased in inflammatory indicators and lipid accumulation-related genes, which was ameliorated by knockdown of TREM-1. Our results also showed that obvious lipid accumulation and inflammatory injury occurred in the liver tissue of HFD-fed mice, while treatment with lentiviral vector short hairpin TREM showed marked improvement in tissue morphology and architecture and less lipid accumulation, thus deciphering the mechanism through which knockdown of TREM-1 ameliorated the inflammatory response and lipid accumulation of NAFLD mice through inactivation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and PI3K/AKT signal pathways, respectively. In conclusion, TREM-1/NF-κB and TREM-1/PI3K/AKT axis could be an important mechanism in ameliorating the inflammatory response and lipid accumulation, respectively, thus shedding light on the development of novel therapeutics to the treatment of NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

The aim of this work was twofold: 1) to investigate the structural and functional alterations of the  (TJ)-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier of ileum and colon, that concentrate most of the microbiota, after exposure to a HFD for 15, 30 and 60 days, and 2) to assess the effect of in vitro exposure to free fatty acids (FFAs), one of the components of HFD, on paracellular barrier of colon-derived Caco-2 cells.HFD exposure induced progressive metabolic changes in male mice that culminated in prediabetes after 60d. Morphological analysis of ileum and colon mucosa showed no signs of epithelial rupture or local inflammation but changes in the junctional content/distribution and/or cellular content of TJ-associated proteins (claudins-1, -2, -3, and occludin) in intestinal epithelia were seen mainly after a prediabetes state has been established. This impairment in TJ structure was not associated with significant changes in intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran. Exposure of Caco-2 monolayers to palmitic or linoleic acids seems to induce a reinforcement of TJ structure while treatment with  had a more diverse effect on TJ protein distribution.TJ structure in distal intestinal epithelia can be specifically impaired by HFD intake at early stage of T2DM, but not by FFAs in vitro. Since the TJ change in ileum/colon was marginal, probably it does not contribute to the disease onset.Copyright © 2019.

All rats were received mechanical ventilation immediately after model reproduction. Carotid arterial blood was collected 4 hours after model reproduction for determining the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO), and oxygenation index (PaO/FiO) was calculated. Carotid venous blood and lung tissues were harvested, and the levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in serum and lung tissue were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pulmonary pathology was observed under optical microscope, and pathological score of Smith was calculated.Under optical microscope, a large number of inflammatory cells infiltration in lung tissue, obvious alveolar collapse, fibrous exudation in alveolar and alveolar hyaline were found in HCl group. In OA group, however, microvascular congestion and interstitial pulmonary edema were the main pathological changes, with alveolar structure being kept relatively intact. Compared with sham group, pathological score of Smith in HCl and OA groups were increased, oxygenation was lowered, and inflammatory factors levels in serum and lung tissue were increased with levels in lung tissue being higher than those in serum, without significant difference between the two models. When pretreated with penehyclidine, however, pathological injury induced by HCl or OA was alleviated, and pathological score of Smith was also decreased as compared with that of corresponding model groups (5.48±1.76 vs. 9.69±2.02, 3.97±2.14 vs. 8.71±2.18, both P < 0.05), PaO/FiO was raised significantly [mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 323±55 vs. 211±27, 307±56 vs. 207±31, both P < 0.05], the inflammatory factors levels in serum and lung tissue were obviously decreased [MPO (μg/L): 11.91±1.55 vs. 14.82±1.25, 12.75±1.16 vs. 16.97±2.06 in serum, 25.80±3.36 vs. 35.18±4.01, 24.23±1.24 vs. 33.94±1.43 in lung tissue; IL-8 (ng/L): 358±30 vs. 459±25, 377±38 vs. 427±34 in serum, 736±53 vs. 866±51, 701±53 vs. 809±39 in lung tissue; NF-κB (ng/L): 483±68 vs. 632±73, 514±83 vs. 685±78 in serum, 984±75 vs. 1 217±123, 944±90 vs. 1 163±105 in lung tissue; all P < 0.05].

There was no significant difference in oxygenation and inflammatory response between the two models of rats. Pre-intraperitoneal injection of penehyclidine equally improved oxygenation state, inhibited lung  response, and reduced lung injury in the two kinds of ARDS, but there was no difference in protective role between two models pretreated with penehyclidine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29095531>Low-level red LED light inhibits hyperkeratinization and  induced by unsaturated fatty  in an in vitro model mimicking acne.</a></h2><p>Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous units (PSU), associated with increased sebum production, abnormal follicular keratinization (hyperkeratinization), follicular overgrowth of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), and increased inflammatory mediator release. Light therapy has attracted medical interests as a safe alternative treatment for acne. Both blue and red light therapies at high doses >10 J/cm have demonstrated marked effects on inflammatory acne lesions. However, few studies have investigated the effects of lower doses of light. The aim of this study is to investigate the biological effects of lower doses of red light at 0.2-1.2 J/cm for acne using an in vitro model previously developed to mimic the  and hyperkeratinization observed clinically in acne.Human epidermal equivalents were topically exposed to an unsaturated fatty ,  (OA), followed by red light-emitting diode (LED) light treatments (light-plus-OA treatments). Endpoints evaluated included the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1α, epidermal barrier integrity, as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), and stratum corneum (SC) thickness to monitor hyperkeratinization.OA-induced IL-1α release was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced following red LED light at 0.2, 0.5, and 1.2 J/cm , from 266 ± 11 pg/ml of no-light-plus-OA-treated (OA treatment without light) controls to 216 ± 9, 231 ± 8, and 212 ± 7 pg/ml, respectively. Histological examination showed that SC thickening following OA treatment was reduced from 43% of total epidermis for no-light-plus-OA treatment to 37% and 38% of total epidermis following 0.5 and 1.1 J/cm red light plus OA treatment, respectively (P < 0.05). Moreover, 1.1 J/cm red-light-plus-OA treatment improved OA-induced TEER changes from 29% of baseline for no-light-plus-OA treatment, to 36% of baseline.Low level red LED light therapy could provide beneficial effects of anti-, normalizing pilosebaceous hyperkeratinization, and improving barrier impairment in Acne vulgaris.

Recent investigations suggest the possible role of the NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome, which regulates IL-1β (interleukin 1β) release and leads to , in this process. Therefore, we investigated the underlying mechanism by which SFAs trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation.The treatment with SFAs, such as palmitic  and stearic , promoted IL-1β release in murine primary macrophages while treatment with  inhibited SFA-induced IL-1β release in a dose-dependent manner. Analyses using polarized light microscopy revealed that intracellular crystallization was provoked in SFA-treated macrophages. As well as IL-1β release, the intracellular crystallization and lysosomal dysfunction were inhibited in the presence of . These results suggest that SFAs activate NLRP3 inflammasome through intracellular crystallization. Indeed, SFA-derived crystals activated NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent IL-1β release via lysosomal dysfunction. Excess SFAs also induced crystallization and IL-1β release in vivo. Furthermore, SFA-derived crystals provoked acute , which was impaired in IL-1β-deficient mice.These findings demonstrate that excess SFAs cause intracellular crystallization and subsequent lysosomal dysfunction, leading to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases.© 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29605557>Nitrolipids in kidney physiology and disease.</a></h2><p>The kidneys are vital organs responsible for maintaining body fluid homeostasis within proper physiologic ranges. Kidney disease is an epidemic clinical problem causing significant morbidity and mortality, and current treatments are limited to renin-angiotensin system blockade or renal replacement therapy for the majority of affected individuals. There is a critical, unmet need for novel pharmacological agents to improve the outcome of patients with kidney disease. Nitro- (NO-OA) is an endogenously generated electrophilic compound with the capacity to modify thiols in proteins, altering their function. The most important targets appear to be the Keap1/Nrf2 and NF-κB pathways, which have widespread effects on antioxidant, detoxifying, and inflammatory responses in cells and tissues. Through these and potentially additional protective actions, NO-OA may be capable of preserving or enhancing kidney function in acute and chronic kidney diseases.Copyright © 2018.

SLN formulation was optimized and the particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential (ZP), encapsulation efficiency, drug release, and morphological properties were characterized. The transdermal efficiency and mechanism of the piroxicam-loaded SLNs were investigated in vitro. With the  induced edema model in rat, the anti-inflammatory efficiency of piroxicam-enriched SLNs (Pir-SLNs) was evaluated. The SLN formulation was optimized as: lecithin 100 mg, glycerin monostearate 200 mg, and Tween (1%, w/w). The particle size is around 102 ± 5.2 nm with a PDI of 0.262. The ZP is 30.21 ± 2.05 mV. The prepared SLNs showed high entrapment efficiency of 87.5% for piroxicam. There is no interaction between piroxicam and the vehicle components. The presence of polymorphic form of lipid with higher drug content in the optimized Pir-SLNs enables the Pir-SLNs to release the drug with a sustained manner. Pir-SLNs with  as enhancer can radically diffuse into both the stratum corneum and dermal layer, as well as penetrate through the hair follicles and sebaceous glands with significantly higher density than the other control groups. Pir-SLNs promptly inhibited the  since the 3rd hour after the treatment by decreasing the PGE level. SLN was demonstrated to be a promising carrier for encapsulation and sustained release of piroxicam. Pir-SLN is a novel topical preparation with great potential for anti- application.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27721373>Inhibition of TRPV1 channels by a naturally occurring omega-9 fatty  reduces pain and itch.</a></h2><p>The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) ion channel is mainly found in primary nociceptive afferents whose activity has been linked to pathophysiological conditions including pain, itch and . Consequently, it is important to identify naturally occurring antagonists of this channel. Here we show that a naturally occurring monounsaturated fatty , , inhibits TRPV1 activity, and also pain and itch responses in mice by interacting with the vanilloid (capsaicin)-binding pocket and promoting the stabilization of a closed state conformation. Moreover, we report an itch-inducing molecule, cyclic phosphatidic , that activates TRPV1 and whose pruritic activity, as well as that of histamine, occurs through the activation of this ion channel. These findings provide insights into the molecular basis of  inhibition of TRPV1 and also into a way of reducing the pathophysiological effects resulting from its activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30023327>Enhanced Lymphatic Uptake of Leflunomide Loaded Nanolipid Carrier via Chylomicron Formation for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis.</a></h2><p> The current study aims the lymphatic delivery of leflunomide loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (LNLC) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, mainly focussed to enhance the lymphatic delivery via chylomicron formation, improved bioavailability and reduced systemic toxicity.  Melt emulsification ultra-sonication method was used to formulate the nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) containing leflunomide. Four batches were prepared by using various concentration of surfactants (tween 80 and poloxmer 188) and lipid mixtures (stearic  and ). All the formulations were studied for various physiochemical properties  The formulation with increased concentration of lipid and surfactants showed highest entrapment efficiency (93.96 ± 0.47%) and better drug release (90.35%) at the end of 48 hrs. In vivo tests were carried out to determine the antiarthritic potential of the formulation in Sprague-dawley rats for a duration of 30d. The effect was evaluated by measuring the reduction in knee thickness. LNLC showed a marked reduction in  compared to standard drug. Intestinal lymphatic uptake studies of LNLC were performed by intraduodenal administration and compared with leflunomide drug solution. The mesenteric lymph node was analysed by HPLC method and the concentration of drug was estimated. It showed that LNLC having highest uptake (40.34μg/ml) when compared with leflunomide drug solution (10.04μg/ml). Radiographic analysis and histopathological studies showed the formation of healthy cartilage after treatment period.  The results suggested that LNLC has the potential to reduce the systemic toxicities associated with conventional therapy along with improved efficacy in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.</p></html>
