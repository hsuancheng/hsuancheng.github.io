This study focuses on the adverse effects of oral supplementation of 1.3% LC in ApoE mice and whether the parenteral administration of LC (subcutaneously, sub) has any impact on the development of atherosclerosis.Mice are randomly divided into three groups (n = 15). All mice are fed a high-fat diet (HFD). The number of Ly6C monocytes; degree of atherosclerosis; plasma LC, γ-butyrobetaine (γBB), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) levels; and microbial community composition are analyzed. Compared with the HFD and HFD ± LC (sub) groups, the number of Ly6C monocytes, atherosclerotic plaque area, and plasma γBB and TMAO levels are increased in the HFD ± LC (oral) group (p < 0.001). Plasma LC levels in the HFD ± LC (sub) group are higher than those in other groups. The levels of γBB, TMAO, and Ly6C monocytes are positively correlated with atherosclerotic plaque area (p < 0.01), and TMAO is positively correlated with Bacteroidetes and negatively correlated with Firmicutes at the phylum level.In contrast with oral LC administration, subcutaneous LC administration, which bypasses its conversion to TMAO in the liver, does not have a detrimental effect on the development of atherosclerosis in male ApoE mice. Taking LC parenterally may be preferable among patients who require LC supplementation.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Three structures have been resolved to date for CaiT, all in the inward-facing state: CRN-bound (with four CRNs per subunit), GBB-bound (two GBBs per subunit), and apo. One of the reported binding sites is the counterpart of the primary site observed in structurally similar transporters. However, the mechanism and pathway(s) of CRN/GBB unbinding and translocation, or even the ability of the substrates to dislodge from the reported binding sites, are yet to be determined. To shed light on these issues, we performed a total of 1.3 μs of molecular dynamics simulations and examined the dynamics of substrate-bound CaiT structures under different conditions. We find that both CRN and GBB are able to dissociate completely from their primary site into the cytoplasm. Substrate molecules initially located at the secondary sites dissociate even faster (within tens of nanoseconds) into the extra- or intracellular regions. Interestingly, the unbinding pathway from the primary site appears to be dictated by the geometry of the unwound part of the transmembrane (TM) helix 3, mostly around Thr(100) therein. Arg(262) on TM7, which apparently mimics the role of Na(+) in CaiT structural homologues, plays a key role in triggering the dissociation of the substrate away from the primary site and guiding its release to the cytoplasm provided that the unwound part of TM3 switches from a shielding to a yielding pose.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22999781>Enzymes involved in L-carnitine biosynthesis are expressed by small intestinal enterocytes in mice: implications for gut health.</a></h2><p>Carnitine is essential for mitochondrial β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. Deficiency of carnitine leads to severe gut atrophy, ulceration and inflammation in animal models of carnitine deficiency. Genetic studies in large populations have linked mutations in the carnitine transporters OCTN1 and OCTN2 with Crohn's disease (CD), while other studies at the same time have failed to show a similar association and report normal serum carnitine levels in CD patients.In this report, we have studied the expression of carnitine-synthesizing enzymes in intestinal epithelial cells to determine the capability of these cells to synthesize carnitine de novo. We studied expression of five enzymes involved in carnitine biosynthesis, namely 6-N-trimethyllysine dioxygenase (TMLD), 4-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (TMABADH), serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 and 2 (SHMT1 and 2) and γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase (BBH) by real-time PCR in mice (C3H strain). We also measured activity of γ-BBH in the intestine using an ex vivo assay and localized its expression by in situ hybridization.Our investigations show that mouse intestinal epithelium expresses all five enzymes required for de novo carnitine biosynthesis; the expression is localized mainly in villous surface epithelial cells throughout the intestine. The final rate-limiting enzyme γ-BBH is highly active in the small intestine; its activity was 9.7 ± 3.5 pmol/mg/min, compared to 22.7 ± 7.3 pmol/mg/min in the liver.We conclude that mouse gut epithelium is able to synthesize carnitine de novo. This capacity to synthesize carnitine in the intestine may play an important role in gut health and can help explain lack of clinical carnitine deficiency signs in subjects with mutations with OCTN transporters.Copyright © 2012 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation.

We investigated whether decreasing concentrations of L-carnitine using an inhibitor of its biosynthesis, mildronate (3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium)-propionate), would influence the sexual behavior or sperm quality in male rats. Mildronate treatment induced a significant decrease in carnitine concentration and an increase in  (GBB) concentration in both plasma and testes extracts. However, the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I in testes and testosterone concentration in plasma was not changed in mildronate treated rat. Behavioral experiments demonstrated that mildronate treatment did not decrease the sexual motivation in both sexually naive and sexually experienced rats. The densities of spermatozoa in the cauda epididymis, as well as motility, were unchanged after mildronate treatment at a dose of 100 mg/kg. In conclusion, our study provides experimental evidence that mildronate induces decrease in the free carnitine concentration in rat testes, but does not decrease the sexual activity or sperm quality of male rats.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29110324>CntA oxygenase substrate profile comparison and  dependency of TMA production in Providencia rettgeri.</a></h2><p>CntA oxygenase is a Rieske 2S-2Fe cluster-containing protein that has been previously described as able to produce trimethylamine (TMA) from carnitine, , glycine betaine, and in one case, choline.

We evaluated if circulating γBB, TMAO, and their common precursors carnitine and trimethyllysine (TML) were dysregulated after heart transplantation and associated with development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) and acute rejection.We measured these metabolites in plasma from heart transplant recipients with everolimus-based (n = 32) and standard cyclosporine-based immunosuppression (n = 30) at different time-points and accompanied by assessment of CAV by intravascular ultrasound.Baseline levels of carnitine, TMAO, and TML were elevated in heart transplant recipients compared with controls, and TML remained elevated throughout the observation period. The -dependent metabolite γBB increased steadily during 3 years of follow-up, with a similar decrease in its endogenous precursor TML. The increase in γBB and the change in TML were associated with a change in total atheroma volume from baseline to 3 years. Increases in γBB and carnitine levels from baseline to 1 year were associated with an increased frequency of acute rejection within the first year after heart transplant.Our study reveals alterations of the carnitine-γBB-TMAO pathway after heart transplant, with increasing levels of γBB being associated with acute rejection and increase in total atheroma volume during 3 years of follow-up. Future studies should clarify whether interactions between dietary factors, immunosuppressive drugs, and the gut  could influence acute rejection and CAV development to delineate mechanisms and potential novel treatment targets.Copyright © 2019 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

Here we report the structures of the sodium-independent carnitine/butyrobetaine antiporter CaiT from Proteus mirabilis (PmCaiT) at 2.3-A and from Escherichia coli (EcCaiT) at 3.5-A resolution. CaiT belongs to the family of betaine/carnitine/choline transporters (BCCT), which are mostly Na(+) or H(+) dependent, whereas EcCaiT is Na(+) and H(+) independent. The three-dimensional architecture of CaiT resembles that of the Na(+)-dependent transporters LeuT and BetP, but in CaiT a methionine sulphur takes the place of the Na(+) ion to coordinate the substrate in the central transport site, accounting for Na(+)-independent transport. Both CaiT structures show the fully open, inward-facing conformation, and thus complete the set of functional states that describe the alternating access mechanism. EcCaiT contains two bound butyrobetaine substrate molecules, one in the central transport site, the other in an extracellular binding pocket. In the structure of PmCaiT, a tryptophan side chain occupies the transport site, and access to the extracellular site is blocked. Binding of both substrates to CaiT reconstituted into proteoliposomes is cooperative, with Hill coefficients up to 1.7, indicating that the extracellular site is regulatory. We propose a mechanism whereby the occupied regulatory site increases the binding affinity of the transport site and initiates substrate translocation.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26660433>Cation-π Interactions Contribute to Substrate Recognition in γ-Butyrobetaine Hydroxylase Catalysis.</a></h2><p>γ-Butyrobetaine hydroxylase (BBOX) is a non-heme Fe(II) - and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase that catalyzes the stereoselective hydroxylation of an unactivated C-H bond of γ-butyrobetaine (γBB) in the final step of carnitine biosynthesis. BBOX contains an aromatic cage for the recognition of the positively charged trimethylammonium group of the γBB substrate. Enzyme binding and kinetic analyses on substrate analogues with P and As substituting for N in the trimethylammonium group show that the analogues are good BBOX substrates, which follow the efficiency trend N(+) >P(+) >As(+).

This cytosolic dimeric protein belongs to the dioxygenase family. In this study, we investigated whether BBOX 1 expression was related to psychiatric disorder in an animal model. We also conducted a case-control study using 284 schizophrenia patients and 409 controls with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5'-near region of BBOX 1. BBOX 1 expression was increased in the medial frontal cortex of a mouse model of schizophrenia induced by maternal immune activation. Furthermore, the genotype and allele frequencies of two SNPs (rs7939644 and rs10767592) were significantly associated with schizophrenia susceptibility. Our results suggest that BBOX 1 might be associated with maternal immune activation and schizophrenia susceptibility.

The kinetic studies included serial determinations of carnitine and metabolites just before, during or between haemodialysis sessions. Analysis was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.Before haemodialysis, the plasma concentrations were (micromol/l) 15.1+/-0.6 (mean+/-SEM) for carnitine, 5.9+/-0.7 for acetylcarnitine, 0.66+/-0.04 for propionylcarnitine and 0.98+/-0.08 for butyrobetaine (basal conditions) or 142+/-23 for carnitine, 69+/-12 for acetylcarnitine, 6.0+/-1.1 for propionylcarnitine and 2.6+/-0.3 for butyrobetaine (carnitine 20 mg/kg). During haemodialysis, the plasma concentrations dropped by approximately 80% for all compounds determined, with extraction coefficients ranging from 0.65 to 0.86. In patients supplemented with 20 mg/kg carnitine, the amount of carnitine removed by haemodialysis equalled 42% of the dose administered, consisting of 2.08 mmol carnitine, 1.03 mmol acetylcarnitine and 0.051 mmol propionylcarnitine. Between the haemodialysis sessions, carnitine, acylcarnitines and butyrobetaine reached apparent steady-state concentrations within 1 day both under basal conditions and after supplementation.Patients on haemodialysis have reduced carnitine, acylcarnitine and butyrobetaine plasma levels, which can be increased by supplementing carnitine. Propionylcarnitine, an important constituent of the acylcarnitine pool, can be removed by haemodialysis.

We found that among several pig tissues, a considerable activity of  dioxygenase (BBD), the last enzyme of carnitine synthesis, exists, like in humans and several other species, only in liver and kidney.

Carnitine concentrations in plasma, liver and kidney at birth were higher than in the subsequent weeks of life in spite of the low BBD activity at birth.

Treatment with l-carnitine elevated vascular tissue levels of l-carnitine, whereas administration of mildronate reduced l-carnitine levels and increased GBB levels. Experimental animals that received the combination of both drugs showed elevated tissue levels of GBB. The results from organ bath experiments demonstrated that increased GBB levels with preserved l-carnitine content in vascular tissues attenuated the development of endothelial dysfunction induced by high glucose. However, changes in vascular tissue l-carnitine and GBB levels had no impact on endothelial dysfunction induced by TG or LPC.

Here we report the functional characterization of this transporter in human fibroblasts. Carnitine enters normal cells by saturable and unsaturable routes, the latter corresponding to Na+-independent uptake. Saturable carnitine transport was absent in cells from patients with primary carnitine deficiency. In control cells, saturable carnitine transport was energized by the electrochemical gradient of Na+. Carnitine uptake was not inhibited by amino acid substrates of transport systems A, ASC, and X-AG, but was inhibited competitively (in potency order) by butyrobetaine > carnitine > palmitoylcarnitine = acetylcarnitine > betaine. Carnitine uptake was also noncompetitively inhibited by verapamil and quinidine, inhibitors of the multidrug resistance family of membrane transporters, suggesting that the carnitine transporter may share a functional motif with this class of transporters. A high-affinity carnitine transporter was present in kidney 293 cells, but not in HepG2 liver cells, whose carnitine transporter had a Km in the millimolar range.

The intracellular  pattern was analyzed by PCA from the digestive gland of clams after 7 and 22 days of transplantation. Results showed a different profile of metabolite between organisms collected from control and exposed sites. At the shorter exposure time, there was an increase in several metabolites in the latter when compared with those from control sites, whereas  profiling at 22 days showed that those metabolites were drastically diminished, with even lower levels than at control sites. These metabolites included: (i) 12 amino acids from the 21 proteogenic and HomoSer, (ii) osmotic protectants such as γ-butyrobetaine and taurine and (iii) nucleotides such as ITP. Regarding sulfur-containing molecules, taurine could be highlighted as a potential biomarker since its concentration was reduced by more than 30 times after 22 days of exposure, whereas the antioxidant glutathione remained constant in the organisms from both control and exposed sites. Although targeted metabolomics has been shown as an early technique of pollutant effect detection, the two-phase pattern could highlight a more complicated metabolite response to pollutants than classical biomarkers.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Elevated acylcarnitine levels are found in obese, insulin resistant humans and rodents, and coincide with lower free carnitine. We hypothesized that increasing free carnitine levels by administration of the carnitine precursor γ-butyrobetaine (γBB) could facilitate FAO, thereby improving insulin sensitivity.C57BL/6N mice were fed with a high  or chow diet with or without γBB supplementation (n=10 per group). After 8weeks of diet, indirect calorimetry, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity tests were performed. AC profiles and carnitine biosynthesis intermediates were analyzed in plasma and tissues by tandem mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography tandem MS.γBB supplementation did not facilitate FAO, was unable to curb bodyweight and did not prevent impaired glucose homeostasis in the HFD fed mice in spite of marked alterations in the acylcarnitine profiles in plasma and liver. Remarkably, γBB did not affect the acylcarnitine profile in other tissues, most notably muscle. Administration of a bolus acetylcarnitine also caused significant changes in plasma and liver, but not in muscle acylcarnitine profiles, again without effect on glucose tolerance.Altogether, increasing carnitine availability affects acylcarnitine profiles in plasma and liver but does not modulate glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity. This may be due to the lack of an effect on muscle acylcarnitine profiles, as muscle tissue is an important contributor to whole body insulin sensitivity. These results warrant caution on making associations between plasma acylcarnitine levels and insulin resistance.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Bovine superoxide dismutase and the Mn(2+)-containing superoxide dismutase from Escherichia coli were not inhibitory. Superoxide anion generated from xanthine/xanthine oxidase was not stimulatory and could not replace ascorbate. Thymine 7-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.6) and thymidine 2'-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.3) were not inhibited by erythrocyte superoxide dismutase or stimulated by superoxide anion.  hydroxylase was inhibited by a number of low-molecular-weight compounds, such as tetranitromethane, Nitro Blue Tetrazolium, adrenaline and Tiron, which may act as scavengers of superoxide anion. Involvement of this radical in other oxygenase reactions has been inferred from the findings that they were inhibitory for the respective enzymes.

The activity in the 100,000 g supernatant fraction of a homogenate of whole kidneys was 48 nkat X g-1 protein (range 32-70 nkat X g-1protein). The cortex and outer medulla had four to six times higher activity than the inner medulla. A 60-fold purification from the soluble fraction of kidney homogenates with a 40% recovery was achieved by ammonium sulphate fractionation followed by DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite chromatography. The enzyme had a specific activity of 2.4 mukat X g-1 protein but was contaminated to a minor degree by other proteins as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Km values for , 2-oxoglutarate and  were 0.2 mmol/l, 0.3 mmol/l and 5.5% (by volume in the gas phase). There was an absolute requirement for ferrous ion. Half-maximal activity was reached with 10 mumol/l of Fe2+ in phosphate buffer (14 mmol/l) at pH 6.5. With a reaction time of 30 min ascorbate and catalase stimulated the reaction seven- and fivefold, respectively. Optimal pH value for the reaction was 6.2-6.5 in phosphate buffer. Decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate in the presence of 4-trimethylaminocrotonate or 4-dimethylaminobutyrate was 40 and 20%, respectively, of that with  as substrate. None of several compounds chemically related to 2-oxoglutarate, including oxaloacetate, stimulated  hydroxylation when tested in the absence of 2-oxoglutarate.

It was shown by NMR spectroscopy that this heteroditopic receptor can bind zwitterions in protic media with an outstanding selectivity for β-alanine betaine G5, which is likely due to a high complementarity between the two partners. This result constitutes a rare example of cavity complexation of a zwitterion by a calix[6]arene. In comparison with the parent urea-based receptors, 6 behaves as a much more efficient host for betaines. This strengthening of the binding properties is due to the better preorganization of the tripodal hydrogen-bonding cap as well as to the higher acidity of the thiourea groups and their poor ability to self-associate. Remarkably, host 6 is able to perform solid-liquid as well as liquid-liquid extraction of G5. Finally, 6 provides an excellent structural model for the binding site of glycine betaine G4 encountered in natural systems.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Addition of sodium salts greatly increased the uptake activity, whereas other salts or non-electrolytes had less effect. The apparent Km for glycine betaine uptake was 8.3 microM and V was about 0.84 nmol min-1 (mg protein)-1 in the presence of 200 mM-NaCl which gave maximum stimulation of the transport. Supplementing bacteroid suspensions with various energy-yielding substrates, or ATP, did not increase glycine betaine uptake rates. The uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), and the respiratory inhibitor potassium cyanide strongly inhibited glycine betaine uptake, but arsenate was totally inactive. Glycine betaine transport showed considerable structural specificity: choline, proline betaine,  and trigonelline did not competitively inhibit the system, although choline and proline betaine were transported by bacteroids.

Human astrocytes (CCF-STTG1 cells) and hepatocytes (HepG2 cells) exposed to aluminum (Al) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), were characterized with lower levels of L-carnitine, diminished β-oxidation, and increased  accumulation compared to the controls. γ-Butyrobetainealdehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) and butyrobetaine dioxygenase (BBDOX), two key enzymes mediating the biogenesis of L-carnitine, were sharply reduced during Al and H₂O₂ challenge. Exposure of the Al and H₂O₂-treated cells to α-ketoglutarate (KG), led to the recovery of L-carnitine production with the concomitant reduction in ROS levels. It appears that the channeling of KG to combat oxidative stress results in decreased L-carnitine synthesis, an event that contributes to the dyslipidemia observed during Al and H₂O₂ insults in these mammalian cells. Hence, KG may help alleviate pathological conditions induced by oxidative stress.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Carnitine, an essential cofactor in the oxidation of fatty acids, is released into the plasma following hydroxylation by γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase (BBH), the final enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway found primarily in the liver. The organic cation transporter (OCTN2), the carnitine transporter found in kidney, is important in the distribution of carnitine by facilitating its renal reabsorption from urine. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that exercise training increases gene and protein expression of BBH and OCTN2, resulting in enhanced plasma carnitine levels. Male Wistar rats were subjected to 2 daily exercise sessions of treadmill running, 5 days per week, for a 10-week period. The concentration of total carnitine in plasma was significantly increased in trained rats compared with sedentary rats. In trained rats, mRNA and protein expression of BBH were increased in liver, whereas only BBH mRNA expression was increased in kidney. Liver of trained rats demonstrated increased mRNA and protein expression of OCTN2 compared with sedentary rats. In kidney of trained rats, however, only an increase in mRNA expression of OCTN2 was observed. Our results suggest that the improved plasma carnitine status in the trained rat is associated with increased carnitine biosynthesis in liver and kidney. The observation that OCTN2 expression was increased in kidney suggests a potential role of the kidney in the reabsorption of carnitine from the urine.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19289605>Identification and characterization of a complete carnitine biosynthesis pathway in Candida albicans.</a></h2><p>Carnitine is an essential metabolite that enables intracellular transport of fatty acids and acetyl units. Here we show that the yeast Candida albicans can synthesize carnitine de novo, and we identify the 4 genes of the pathway. Null mutants of orf19.4316 (trimethyllysine dioxygenase), orf19.6306 (trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase), and orf19.7131 (butyrobetaine dioxygenase) lacked their respective enzymatic activities and were unable to utilize fatty acids, acetate, or ethanol as a sole carbon source, in accordance with the strict requirement for carnitine-mediated transport under these growth conditions. The second enzyme of carnitine biosynthesis, hydroxytrimethyllysine aldolase, is encoded by orf19.6305, a member of the threonine aldolase (TA) family in C. albicans. A strain lacking orf19.6305 showed strongly reduced growth on fatty acids and was unable to utilize either acetate or ethanol, but TA activity was unaffected. Growth of the null mutants on nonfermentable carbon sources is restored only by carnitine biosynthesis intermediates after the predicted enzymatic block in the pathway, which provides independent evidence for a specific defect in carnitine biosynthesis for each of the mutants.

Carnitine is found in dairy and meat products, but is also biosynthesized from lysine and methionine via a process that, in rat, takes place essentially in the liver. After intestinal absorption or hepatic biosynthesis, carnitine is transferred to organs whose  is dependent on fatty acid oxidation, such as heart and skeletal muscle. In skeletal muscle, carnitine concentration was found to be 50 times higher than in the plasma, implicating an active transport system for carnitine. In this study, we characterized this transport in isolated rat myotubes, established mouse C2C12 myoblastic cells, and rat myotube plasma membranes and found that it was Na(+)-dependent and partly inhibited by a Na(+)/K(+) ATPase inhibitor. L-carnitine analogues such as D-carnitine and  interfere with this system as does acyl carnitine. Among these inhibitors, the most potent was mildronate (3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium)propionate), known as a  hydroxylase inhibitor. It also induced a marked decrease in carnitine transport into muscle cells. Removal of carnitine or treatment with mildronate induced growth inhibition of cultured C2C12 myoblastic cells.

CaiB (45 kDa) and CaiD (27 kDa) were purified in two steps to electrophoretic homogeneity from overexpression strains. CaiB was identified as crotonobetainyl-CoA:carnitine CoA-transferase by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and enzymatic assays. The enzyme exhibits high cosubstrate specificity to CoA derivatives of trimethylammonium compounds. In particular, the N-terminus of CaiB shows significant identity with other CoA-transferases (e.g., FldA from Clostridium sporogenes, Frc from Oxalobacter formigenes, and BbsE from Thauera aromatica) and CoA-hydrolases (e.g., BaiF from Eubacterium sp.). CaiD was shown to be a crotonobetainyl-CoA hydratase using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and enzymatic assays. Besides crotonobetainyl-CoA CaiD is also able to hydrate crotonyl-CoA with a significantly lower Vmax (factor of 10(3)) but not crotonobetaine. The substrate specificity of CaiD and its homology to the crotonase confirm this enzyme as a new member of the crotonase superfamily. Concluding these results, it was verified that hydration of crotonobetaine to L-carnitine proceeds at the CoA level in two steps: the CaiD catalyzed hydration of crotonobetainyl-CoA to L-carnitinyl-CoA, followed by a CoA transfer from L-carnitinyl-CoA to crotonobetaine, catalyzed by CaiB. When gamma-butyrobetainyl-CoA was used as a cosubstrate (CoA donor), the first reaction is the CoA transfer. The optimal ratios of CaiB and CaiD during this hydration reaction, determined to be 4:1 when crotonobetainyl-CoA was used as cosubstrate and 5:1 when gamma-butyrobetainyl-CoA was used as cosubstrate, are different from that found for in vivo conditions (1:3).</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25873316>Determination of trimethylamine-N-oxide in combination with L-carnitine and γ-butyrobetaine in human plasma by UPLC/MS/MS.</a></h2><p>An ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the quantification of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) simultaneously with TMAO-related molecules L-carnitine and γ-butyrobetaine (GBB) in human blood plasma.

An experiment with 20 pigs was performed, which were either fed a diet ad-libitum or fasted for 24 h. Fasted pigs had higher relative mRNA concentrations of the PPARalpha target genes carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 and acyl-CoA oxidase in liver, heart, kidney, and small intestinal mucosa than control pigs, indicative of PPARalpha activation in these tissues (P<.05). Fasted pigs had a higher activity of  dioxygenase (BBD), enzyme that catalyses the last step of carnitine biosynthesis in liver and kidney, and higher relative mRNA concentrations of OCTN2, the most important carnitine transporter, in liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, and small intestinal mucosa than control pigs (P<.05).

The fraction of radioactivity found in [3H]-carnitine in the liver decreased from 63.2 +/- 1.50% to 39.2 +/- 1.11% (mean +/- SEM). Total carnitine in the liver also decreased, whereas the precursor butyrobetaine increased from 5.01 +/- 0.71 nmol/g to 8.22 +/- 0.82 nmol/g (mean +/- SEM). VPA also exhibited a dramatic effect on the conversion of an unlabeled loading amount of butyrobetaine.

In the presence of a sodium chloride gradient, an overshoot could be observed, indicating active sodium-dependent transport. A similar overshoot was recorded in the presence of lithium, but not of potassium, cesium, or choline chloride. Investigation of several sodium salts revealed that an overshoot could only be observed in the presence of chloride, but not of nitrate, thiocyanate, sulfate, or gluconate. An osmolarity plot in the presence of sodium chloride revealed a slope different from zero and a positive intercept, indicating active transport and nonspecific binding, respectively. In agreement with the osmolarity plot, the kinetic characterization of butyrobetaine transport revealed a binding and a saturable component. The saturable component could be described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a Km of 4.88 +/- 0.70 mmol/L and a Vmax of 4.16 +/- 0.73 picomoles per milligram of protein per second. Butyrobetaine transport could be inhibited significantly (30%) by 250 micromol/L propionylcarnitine, but not by D- or L-carnitine, other acylcarnitines (acetylcarnitine, isovalerylcarnitine, palmitoylcarnitine), trimethyllysine, or quinine.

Control rats were pair-fed to BDL rats, and all rats were fed an artificial diet with negligible contents of carnitine, butyrobetaine, or trimethyllysine. Biosynthesis of carnitine and its precursors was determined by measuring their excretion in urine and accumulation in the body of the animals. Four weeks after BDL, total carnitine content was increased by 33% in livers from BDL rats when compared with control rats, but was unchanged in skeletal muscle and whole carcass. The plasma total carnitine concentration averaged 29.0 +/- 4.1 vs. 46.4 +/- 7.3 micromol/L in BDL rats and control rats, respectively. Urinary total carnitine excretion was reduced by 56% in BDL rats as compared with control rats. Carnitine biosynthesis was significantly decreased in BDL rats (0.45 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.93 +/- 0.08 micromol/100 g body weight/d in BDL and control rats, respectively). The tissue content of free and protein-linked trimethyllysine, a carnitine precursor, and trimethyllysine plasma concentrations were not different between BDL and control rats. However, urinary trimethyllysine excretion was increased 5-fold in BDL rats and approximated glomerular filtration. In contrast, urinary excretion of butyrobetaine, the direct carnitine precursor, was decreased by 40% in BDL rats as compared with control rats. Trimethyllysine biosynthesis was not different, but butyrobetaine biosynthesis was decreased by 51% in BDL as compared with control rats. In conclusion, carnitine biosynthesis is decreased in BDL rats as a result of a defect in the conversion of trimethyllysine to butyrobetaine.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21045919>Transport of L-carnitine in human corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Previously we demonstrated expression and localization of carnitine/organic cation transporters, OCTN1 and OCTN2, in human corneal and conjunctival epithelia. The present study aimed to examine the characteristics of L-carnitine transporters in cultured human limbal corneal (HCLE) and conjunctival epithelial (HCjE) cells.Time-course, Na(+)-dependence, kinetics, energy- and pH- dependence of L-carnitine transport were investigated by monitoring L-[(3)H]carnitine uptake into HCLE and HCjE cells. To determine the specificity of action, competition and inhibition studies were performed.The uptake of L-carnitine into HCLE and HCjE cells was saturable and time-dependent. An Eadie-Hofstee plot showed two distinct components: a high- and a low- affinity carnitine transport system in HCLE and/or HCjE cells. L-carnitine transport was significantly inhibited by the  inhibitors (sodium azide, dinitrophenol, iodoacetic acid). The L-carnitine analogs (D-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine and γ-butyrobetaine), tetraethylammonium (TEA), 2-amino-2-norbornane carboxylic acid (BCH), strongly inhibited uptake of L-[(3)H]carnitine. Uptake of L-[(3)H]carnitine also required the presence of Na(+) in the external medium and the uptake activity was maximal at pH 5.5. The anti-OCTN2 antibody blocked L-carnitine uptake in both HCLE and HCjE cells whereas the anti-OCTN1 antibody did not significantly block L-carnitine uptake.L-carnitine is transported into HCLE and HCjE cells by an active carrier mediated transport system that is time-, Na(+)-, energy- and pH- dependent.

The last step of carnitine biosynthesis is the conversion of butyrobetaine to carnitine by butyrobetaine hydroxylase. We investigated the effect of N-trimethyl-hydrazine-3-propionate (THP), a butyrobetaine analogue, on butyrobetaine hydroxylase kinetics, and carnitine biosynthesis and body homeostasis in rats fed a casein-based or a vegetarian diet. The K(m )of butyrobetaine hydroxylase purified from rat liver was 41 +/- 9 micromol x L(-1) for butyrobetaine and 37 +/- 5 micromol x L(-1) for THP, and THP was a competitive inhibitor of butyrobetaine hydroxylase (K(i) 16 +/- 2 micromol x L(-1)). In rats fed a vegetarian diet, renal excretion of total carnitine was increased by THP (20 mg.100 g(-1) x day(-1) for three weeks), averaging 96 +/- 36 and 5.3 +/- 1.2 micromol x day(-1) in THP-treated and control rats, respectively. After three weeks of treatment, the total carnitine plasma concentration (8.8 +/- 2.1 versus 52.8 +/- 11.4 micromol x L(-1)) and tissue levels were decreased in THP-treated rats (liver 0.19 +/- 0.03 versus 0.59 +/- 0.08 and muscle 0.24 +/- 0.04 versus 1.07 +/- 0.13 micromol x g(-1)). Carnitine biosynthesis was blocked in THP-treated rats (-0.22 +/- 0.13 versus 0.57 +/- 0.21 micromol x 100 g(-1) x day(-1)). Similar results were obtained in rats treated with the casein-based diet. THP inhibited carnitine transport by rat renal brush-border membrane vesicles competitively (K(i) 41 +/- 3 micromol x L(-1)). Palmitate  in vivo was impaired in THP-treated rats and the livers showed mixed steatosis. Steady-state mRNA levels of the carnitine transporter rat OCTN2 were increased in THP-treated rats in skeletal muscle and small intestine. In conclusion, THP inhibits butyrobetaine hydroxylase competitively, blocks carnitine biosynthesis in vivo and interacts competitively with renal carnitine reabsorption. THP-treated rats develop systemic carnitine deficiency over three weeks and can therefore serve as an animal model for human carnitine deficiency.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530985>l-Carnitine in omnivorous diets induces an atherogenic gut microbial pathway in humans.</a></h2><p>l-Carnitine, an abundant nutrient in red meat, accelerates atherosclerosis in mice via gut -dependent formation of trimethylamine (TMA) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) via a multistep pathway involving an atherogenic intermediate, γ-butyrobetaine (γBB). The contribution of γBB in gut -dependent l-carnitine metabolism in humans is unknown.Omnivores and vegans/vegetarians ingested deuterium-labeled l-carnitine (d3-l-carnitine) or γBB (d9-γBB), and both plasma metabolites and fecal polymicrobial transformations were examined at baseline, following oral antibiotics, or following chronic (≥2 months) l-carnitine supplementation. Human fecal commensals capable of performing each step of the l-carnitine→γBB→TMA transformation were identified.Studies with oral d3-l-carnitine or d9-γBB before versus after antibiotic exposure revealed gut  contribution to the initial 2 steps in a metaorganismal l-carnitine→γBB→TMA→TMAO pathway in subjects. Moreover, a striking increase in d3-TMAO generation was observed in omnivores over vegans/vegetarians (>20-fold; P = 0.001) following oral d3-l-carnitine ingestion, whereas fasting endogenous plasma l-carnitine and γBB levels were similar in vegans/vegetarians (n = 32) versus omnivores (n = 40). Fecal metabolic transformation studies, and oral isotope tracer studies before versus after chronic l-carnitine supplementation, revealed that omnivores and vegans/vegetarians alike rapidly converted carnitine to γBB, whereas the second gut microbial transformation, γBB→TMA, was diet inducible (l-carnitine, omnivorous). Extensive anaerobic subculturing of human feces identified no single commensal capable of l-carnitine→TMA transformation, multiple community members that converted l-carnitine to γBB, and only 1 Clostridiales bacterium, Emergencia timonensis, that converted γBB to TMA. In coculture, E. timonensis promoted the complete l-carnitine→TMA transformation.In humans, dietary l-carnitine is converted into the atherosclerosis- and thrombosis-promoting metabolite TMAO via 2 sequential gut -dependent transformations: (a) initial rapid generation of the atherogenic intermediate γBB, followed by (b) transformation into TMA via low-abundance  in omnivores, and to a markedly lower extent, in vegans/vegetarians.

A remover (non-polar solvent) and extractant (aqueous solution) were introduced into the derivatization system (acetonitrile) to obtain a water-in-oil emulsion state that increased the mass transfer of analytes. As a proof of concept, three quaternary ammonium substances, including butyrobetaine, l-carnitine and acetyl-l-carnitine, were also used as analytes and determined in pharmaceuticals, personal care products, food and human plasma. The analytes were derivatized with 4-bromomethylbiphenyl for fluorescence detection and improved retention in the column. The linear response was 10-2000nM for l-carnitine and acetyl-l-carnitine with a good determination coefficient (r(2)>0.998) in the standard solution. The detection limit for l-carnitine and acetyl-l-carnitine was 4.5 fmol. The method was also successfully applied to a 1μL sample of human plasma. In the linearity calculations for determining butyrobetaine, l-carnitine and acetyl-l-carnitine in human plasma, the determination coefficients ranged from 0.996 to 0.999. Linear regression exhibited good reproducibility and a relative standard deviation better than 7.50% for the slope and 9.06% for the intercept.

The pathophysiology of EED remains poorly understood.We measured serum metabolites using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 400 children, aged 12-59months, from rural Malawi. Gut permeability was assessed by the dual-sugar absorption test.80.7% of children had EED. Of 677 serum metabolites measured, 21 were negatively associated and 56 were positively associated with gut permeability, using a false discovery rate approach (q<0.05, p<0.0095). Increased gut permeability was associated with elevated acylcarnitines, , fatty acid β-oxidation intermediates, fatty acid ω-oxidation products, odd-chain fatty acids, trimethylamine-N-oxide, cystathionine, and homocitrulline, and with lower citrulline, ornithine, polyphenol metabolites, hippurate, tryptophan, and indolelactate.EED is a syndrome characterized by secondary carnitine deficiency, abnormal fatty acid oxidation, alterations in polyphenol and amino acid metabolites, and metabolic dysregulation of sulfur amino acids, tryptophan, and the urea cycle. Future studies are needed to corroborate the presence of secondary carnitine deficiency among children with EED and to understand how these metabolic derangements may negatively affect the growth and development of young children.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Formerly we detected GBB-esterase enzymatic activity in rat blood serum using phenylated  as an artificial substrate of the enzyme and HPLC. The aim of the present work was to develop an assay that would enable spectrophotometric or colorimetric determination of the reaction products of GBB-esterase activity and to reveal individual proteins performing GBB-esterase activity in rat blood serum.

We have shown that the enzymatic hydrolysis of GBB 1-naphthyl ester to 1-naphthol in rat blood serum is due to GBB-esterase activity. An attempt was done to purify the enzyme from rat blood serum. By combining DEAE Sepharose at pH 4.2 and affinity chromatography with procainamide we achieved a 68-fold enrichment of GBB-esterase activity in our preparations.

An alternative pathway of TMAO formation from carnitine is via the microbiota-dependent intermediate γ-butyrobetaine (γBB). Elevated TMAO levels are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), but little is known about TMAO in obesity. Given the proposed contribution of microbiota alterations in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), we investigated the potential impact of obesity, lifestyle-induced weight loss, and bariatric surgery on plasma levels of TMAO, its microbiota-dependent intermediate γBB, and its diet-dependent precursors carnitine and choline.TMAO, γBB, carnitine, and choline were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in 34 obese individuals (17 with and 17 without T2D) undergoing bariatric surgery and 17 controls.TMAO was not elevated in obese patients or reduced by lifestyle interventions but increased approximately twofold after bariatric surgery. Similar to TMAO, plasma levels of γBB were not influenced by lifestyle interventions but increased moderately after bariatric surgery. In contrast, carnitine and choline, which are abundant in nutrients, such as in red meat and eggs, and not microbiota dependent, were reduced after lifestyle interventions and rebounded after bariatric surgery.The major increase in TMAO after bariatric surgery was unexpected because high TMAO levels have been linked to CVD, whereas bariatric surgery is known to reduce CVD risk.

The organism survives these stresses by the intracellular accumulation of osmolytes: low-molecular-weight organic compounds which exert a counterbalancing force. The primary osmolyte in L. monocytogenes is glycine betaine, which is accumulated from the environment via two transport systems: glycine betaine porter I, an Na(+)-glycine betaine symporter; and glycine betaine porter II, an ATP-dependent transporter. The biochemical characteristics of glycine betaine porter I were investigated in a mutant strain (LTG59) lacking the ATP-dependent transporter. At 4% NaCl, glycine betaine uptake in LTG59 was about fivefold lower than in strain DP-L1044, which has both transporters, indicating that the ATP-dependent transporter is the primary means by which glycine betaine enters the cell. In the absence of osmotic stress, cold-activated uptake by both transporters was most rapid between 7 and 12 degrees C, but a larger fraction of the total uptake was via the ATP-dependent transporter than was observed under salt-stressed conditions. Twelve glycine betaine analogs were tested for their ability to inhibit glycine betaine uptake and growth of stressed cultures. Carnitine, dimethylglycine, and  appear to inhibit the ATP-dependent transporter, while trigonelline and triethylglycine primarily inhibit glycine betaine porter I.

The molecular mass was 95 kdaltons as determined by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. From electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel the molecular mass was estimated to 92 kdaltons, from gel filtration through columns of Sephadex G-200 to 86 kdaltons, and from gel filtration through thin layers of Sephadex G-150 and G-200 to 82 kdaltons. Calculation of molecular mass from Stokes radius, sedimentation coefficient, and partial specific volume gave a value of 96 kdaltons, and from the sedimentation coefficient, 93 kdaltons.

Therefore, wild-type mice and mice deficient in PPAR alpha (PPAR alpha-/-) were treated with the PPAR alpha agonist WY 14,643. Wild-type mice treated with WY 14,643 had a greater abundance of OCTN2 mRNA in their liver, muscle, kidney, and small intestine and a greater abundance of OCTN3 mRNA in kidney and small intestine than did untreated wild-type mice (P < 0.05).

Untreated PPAR alpha-/- mice had a lower abundance of OCTN2 mRNA in liver, kidney, and small intestine and lower carnitine concentrations in plasma, liver, and kidney than did untreated wild-type mice (P < 0.05). In PPAR alpha-/- mice, treatment with WY 14,643 did not influence mRNA abundance of OCTN2 and OCTN3 and carnitine concentrations in all tissues analyzed. The abundance of OCTN1 mRNA in all the tissues analyzed was not changed by treatment with WY 14,643 in wild-type or PPAR alpha-/- mice. In conclusion, this study shows that transcriptional upregulation of OCTN2 and OCTN3 in tissues and of enzymes involved in hepatic carnitine biosynthesis are mediated by PPAR alpha.

Contrary to related proteins, CaiT activity was not modulated by osmotic stress. l-Carnitine binding to CaiT increased the protein fluorescence and caused a red shift in the emission maximum, an observation explained by ligand-induced conformational alterations. The fluorescence effect was specific for betaine structures, for which the distance between trimethylammonium and carboxyl groups proved to be crucial for affinity.

Enterobacteria possess a specific biotransformation pathway which can be used for the enantioselective production of L(-)-carnitine. Although bioprocesses catalyzed by enzymes or whole cells can overcome the lack of enantioselectivity of chemical methods, current processes for L(-)-carnitine production still have severe disadvantages, such as the low yields, side reactions and the need of high catalyst concentrations and anaerobic conditions for proper expression of the biotransformation pathway. Additionally, genetically engineered strains so far constructed for L(-)-carnitine production are based on plasmids and, therefore, suffer from segregational unstability.In this work, a stable, high yielding strain for L(-)-carnitine production from low cost substrates was constructed. A  engineering strategy was implemented in a multiple mutant for use in both growing and resting cells systems. The effect of mutations on gene expression and  was analyzed to characterize the productivity constraints of the wild type and the overproducer strains. Precise deletion of genes which encode proteins of central and carnitine metabolisms were performed. Specifically, flux through the TCA cycle was increased by deletion of aceK (which encodes a bifunctional kinase/phosphatase which inhibits isocitrate dehydrogenase activity) and the synthesis of the by-product γ-butyrobetaine was prevented by deletion of caiA (which encodes a crotonobetainyl-CoA reductase). Both mutations led to improve the L(-)-carnitine production by 20 and 42%, respectively. Moreover, the highly regulated promoter of the cai operon was substituted by a constitutive artificial promoter increasing the biotransformation rate, even under aerobic conditions. Resting cells of the BW ΔaceK ΔcaiA p37cai strain produced 59.6 mmol l(-1) · h(-1) of L(-)-carnitine, doubling the productivity of the wild type strain. In addition, almost total conversion was attained in less than two hours without concomitant production of the side product γ-butyrobetaine.L(-)-carnitine production has been enhanced by strain engineering.  engineering strategies herein implemented allowed obtaining a robust and high yielding E. coli strain. The new overproducer strain attained almost complete conversion of crotonobetaine into L(-)-carnitine with growing and resting cells, and even under aerobic conditions, overcoming the main environmental restriction to carnitine  expression. So far, this is the best performing L(-)-carnitine production E. coli strain described.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25440057>γ-Butyrobetaine is a proatherogenic intermediate in gut microbial metabolism of L-carnitine to TMAO.</a></h2><p>L-carnitine, a nutrient in red meat, was recently reported to accelerate atherosclerosis via a metaorganismal pathway involving gut microbial trimethylamine (TMA) formation and host hepatic conversion into trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Herein, we show that following L-carnitine ingestion, γ-butyrobetaine (γBB) is produced as an intermediary metabolite by gut microbes at a site anatomically proximal to and at a rate ∼1,000-fold higher than the formation of TMA. Moreover, we show that γBB is the major gut microbial metabolite formed from dietary L-carnitine in mice, is converted into TMA and TMAO in a gut -dependent manner (like dietary L-carnitine), and accelerates atherosclerosis. Gut microbial composition and functional metabolic studies reveal that distinct taxa are associated with the production of γBB or TMA/TMAO from dietary L-carnitine.

In the present study we used the mev-1 mutant of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans fed on a high glucose concentration in liquid media as a diabetes model and tested the effects of carnitine supplementation on their survival under heat-stress. Carnitine at 100 μM completely prevented the survival reduction that was caused by the application of 10 mM glucose. RNA-interference for sir-2.1, a candidate genes mediating the effects of carnitine revealed no contribution of the sirtuin for the rescue of survival. Under daf-12 RNAi rescue of survival by carnitine was abolished. RNA-interference for γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase 2, encoding the key enzyme for carnitine biosynthesis did neither increase glucose toxicity nor prevent the rescue of survival by carnitine, suggesting that the effects of carnitine supplementation on carnitine levels were significant. Finally, it was demonstrated that neither the amount of lysosomes nor the proteasomal activity were increased by carnitine, excluding that protein degradation pathways, such as autophagy or proteasomal degradation, are involved in the protective carnitine effects. In conclusion, carnitine supplementation prevents the reduction of survival caused by glucose in C. elegans in dependence on a nuclear hormone receptor which displays high homologies to the vertebrate peroxisomal proliferator activated receptors.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Two groups of NMRI mice were fed either a control or a carnitine-supplemented diet (1 g/kg diet) from weaning to 19 months of age, and parameters of hepatic  and stress signalling and skeletal muscle gene expression were analysed in the mice at 19 months of age.

Transport of carnitine and valproylcarnitine by the proximal tubular carnitine transporter OCTN2 was assessed in vitro.In the patient starting valproate, the plasma carnitine and acetylcarnitine levels dropped for 1-3 weeks and had recovered after 3-5 weeks, whereas the plasma levels of propionyl and valproylcarnitine increased steadily over 5 weeks. The renal excretion and excretion fractions (EFs) of carnitine, acetylcarnitine, propionylcarnitine, and butyrobetaine decreased substantially after starting valproate. Compared with controls, patients on long-term valproate treatment had similar plasma levels of carnitine, acetylcarnitine, and propionylcarnitine, whereas valproylcarnitine was found only in patients. Urinary excretion and renal clearance of carnitine, acetylcarnitine, propionylcarnitine, and butyrobetaine were decreased in valproate-treated compared with that in control patients, reaching statistical significance for carnitine. The EFs of carnitine, acetylcarnitine, and propionylcarnitine were <5% of the filtered load in controls and were lower in valproate-treated patients. In contrast, the EF for valproylcarnitine approached 100%, resulting from a low affinity of valproylcarnitine for the carnitine transporter OCTN2 and competition with concomitantly filtered carnitine.The initial drop in plasma carnitine levels of valproate-treated patients is most likely due to impaired carnitine biosynthesis, whereas the recovery of the plasma carnitine levels is explainable by an increased renal expression of OCTN2.

Inhibition of OCTN2 leads to a decrease in carnitine and acylcarnitine contents in tissues and  metabolism optimization-related cardioprotective effects. The recent inclusion of meldonium in the World Anti-Doping Agency List of Prohibited Substances and Methods has raised questions about the pharmacokinetics of meldonium and its unusually long elimination time. Therefore, in this study, the rate of meldonium washout after the end of the treatment was tested with and without administration of carnitine, γ-butyrobetaine (GBB) and furosemide to evaluate the importance of competition for OCTN2 transport in mice. Here, we show that carnitine and GBB administration during the washout period effectively stimulated the elimination of meldonium. GBB induced a more pronounced effect on meldonium elimination than carnitine due to the higher affinity of GBB for OCTN2. The diuretic effect of furosemide did not significantly affect the elimination of meldonium, carnitine and GBB. In conclusion, the competition of meldonium, carnitine and GBB for OCTN2-mediated transport determines the pharmacokinetic properties of meldonium. Thus, due to their affinity for OCTN2, GBB and carnitine but not furosemide stimulated meldonium elimination. During long-term treatment, OCTN2-mediated transport ensures a high muscle content of meldonium, while tissue clearance depends on relatively slow diffusion, thus resulting in the unusually long complete elimination period of meldonium.© 2016 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society).</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11341370>Effect of  on fatty liver in juvenile visceral steatosis mice.</a></h2><p>We pharmacokinetically examined the effect of , a precursor of L-carnitine, on the change of fatty acid  in juvenile visceral steatosis (JVS) mice, which have systemic L-carnitine deficiency due to lack of L-carnitine transporter activity.

Recently determined crystal structures of CaiT from Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis revealed an inverted five-transmembrane-helix repeat similar to that in the amino acid/Na(+) symporter LeuT. The ion independence of CaiT makes it unique in this family. Here we show that mutations of arginine 262 (R262) make CaiT Na(+)-dependent. The transport activity of R262 mutants increased by 30-40% in the presence of a membrane potential, indicating substrate/Na(+) cotransport. Structural and biochemical characterization revealed that R262 plays a crucial role in substrate binding by stabilizing the partly unwound TM1' helix. Modeling CaiT from P. mirabilis in the outward-open and closed states on the corresponding structures of the related symporter BetP reveals alternating orientations of the buried R262 sidechain, which mimic sodium binding and unbinding in the Na(+)-coupled substrate symporters.

The conservation of l-carnitine metabolism genes in different bacterial taxonomic classes underscores the role of l-carnitine as a ubiquitous nutrient. The experimental characterization of novel metabolic pathways is essential for realizing the value of genome sequences and improving our knowledge of the enzymatic capabilities of the bacterial world. However, 30% to 40% of genes of a typical genome remain unannotated or associated with a putative function.

The occurrence of conserved gene clusters for carnitine metabolism in soil, plant-associated, and marine bacteria underlines the environmental abundance of carnitine and suggests this molecule might make a significant contribution to ecosystem nitrogen and carbon cycling.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27993177>Diets high in resistant starch increase plasma levels of trimethylamine-N-oxide, a gut microbiome metabolite associated with CVD risk.</a></h2><p>Production of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a biomarker of CVD risk, is dependent on intestinal microbiota, but little is known of dietary conditions promoting changes in gut microbial communities. Resistant starches (RS) alter the human microbiota. We sought to determine whether diets varying in RS and carbohydrate (CHO) content affect plasma TMAO levels. We also assessed postprandial glucose and insulin responses and plasma  changes to diets high and low in RS. In a cross-over trial, fifty-two men and women consumed a 2-week baseline diet (41 percentage of energy (%E) CHO, 40 % , 19 % protein), followed by 2-week high- and low-RS diets separated by 2-week washouts. RS diets were assigned at random within the context of higher (51-53 %E) v. lower CHO (39-40 %E) intake. Measurements were obtained in the fasting state and, for glucose and insulin, during a meal test matching the composition of the assigned diet. With lower CHO intake, plasma TMAO, carnitine, betaine and γ-butyrobetaine concentrations were higher after the high- v. low-RS diet (P<0·01 each). These metabolites were not differentially affected by high v. low RS when CHO intake was high. Although the high-RS meal reduced postprandial insulin and glucose responses when CHO intake was low (P<0·01 each), RS did not affect fasting lipids, lipoproteins, glucose or insulin irrespective of dietary CHO content. In conclusion, a lower-CHO diet high in RS was associated with higher plasma TMAO levels. These findings, together with the absence of change in fasting lipids, suggest that short-term high-RS diets do not improve markers of cardiometabolic health.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'fat metabolism', 'insulin resistance', 'metabolism', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17879759>Determination of highly soluble L-carnitine in biological samples by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescent derivatization.</a></h2><p>This study was performed in order to validate an effective high performance liquid chromatograpy (HPLC) method to determine L-carnitine in biological samples such as plasma, milk and muscle in cows.

We investigated the molecular mechanism of hepatic uptake of GBB in rat hepatocytes. Cellular localization of rat Octn2 (rOctn2:Slc22A5) was studied by Western blot analysis. Uptake of deuterated GBB (d(3)-GBB) was examined in HEK293 cells expressing rOctn2 (HEK293/rOctn2) and freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. d(3)-GBB was quantified by use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Western blot analysis demonstrated an expression of OCTN2 protein in hepatic basolateral membrane but not in bile canalicular membrane fraction. Furthermore, we found that d(3)-GBB was taken up by rOctn2 in an Na(+)-dependent manner with K(m) value of 13 microM. The apparent K(m) value for d(3)-GBB transport in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes was 9 microM. d(3)-GBB uptake by the rat hepatocytes was inhibited by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to 30% of the control, whereas it was inhibited by carnitine to 62% of the control, even at 500 microM. Furthermore, d(3)-GBB uptake by rat hepatocytes was decreased by 45% with rat Gat2 (Slc6A13, a major liver GABA transporter) silenced by the microRNA method. Accordingly, the present study clearly demonstrates that GBB is taken up by hepatocytes for carnitine biosynthesis not only via Octn2 but also via the GABA transporter, possibly Gat2.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500110>Carnitine Inborn Errors of .</a></h2><p>Carnitine plays essential roles in intermediary . In non-vegetarians, most of carnitine sources (~75%) are obtained from diet whereas endogenous synthesis accounts for around 25%. Renal carnitine reabsorption along with dietary intake and endogenous production maintain carnitine homeostasis. The precursors for carnitine biosynthesis are lysine and methionine. The biosynthetic pathway involves four enzymes: 6--trimethyllysine dioxygenase (TMLD), 3-hydroxy-6--trimethyllysine aldolase (HTMLA), 4--trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (TMABADH), and γ-butyrobetaine dioxygenase (BBD). OCTN2 (organic cation/carnitine transporter novel type 2) transports carnitine into the cells. One of the major functions of carnitine is shuttling long-chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix for β-oxidation. This transport is achieved by mitochondrial carnitine-acylcarnitine cycle, which consists of three enzymes: carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I), carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II). Carnitine inborn errors of  could result from defects in carnitine biosynthesis, carnitine transport, or mitochondrial carnitine-acylcarnitine cycle. The presentation of these disorders is variable but common findings include hypoketotic hypoglycemia, cardio(myopathy), and liver disease.

Using the degenerate primers designed for organic anion transporters and an organic cation transporter, we isolated a novel cDNA encoding a carnitine transporter (CT1) from rat intestine. CT1 encodes a 557-amino-acid protein with 12 putative membrane-spanning domains. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, CT1 mediated a high-affinity transport of L-carnitine (Km = 25 microM). The replacement of extracellular sodium with Li reduced CT1-mediated L-carnitine uptake to 19.8%.

We investigated the effect of PPAR activation on plasma amino acid levels using two PPARα activators with different ligand binding properties, tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA) and fish oil, where the pan-PPAR agonist TTA is a more potent ligand than omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition, plasma L-carnitine esters were investigated to reflect cellular fatty acid catabolism. Male Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus) were fed a high-fat (25% w/w) diet including TTA (0.375%, w/w), fish oil (10%, w/w) or a combination of both. The rats were fed for 50 weeks, and although TTA and fish oil had hypotriglyceridemic effects in these animals, only TTA lowered the body weight gain compared to high fat control animals. Distinct dietary effects of fish oil and TTA were observed on plasma amino acid composition. Administration of TTA led to increased plasma levels of the majority of amino acids, except arginine and lysine, which were reduced. Fish oil however, increased plasma levels of only a few amino acids, and the combination showed an intermediate or TTA-dominated effect. On the other hand, TTA and fish oil additively reduced plasma levels of the L-carnitine precursor γ-butyrobetaine, as well as the carnitine esters acetylcarnitine, propionylcarnitine, valeryl/isovalerylcarnitine, and octanoylcarnitine. These data suggest that while both fish oil and TTA affect lipid , strong PPARα activation is required to obtain effects on amino acid plasma levels.

This study investigates the ontogeny of OCTN2, gamma-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (TMABA-DH) and  hydroxylase (BBH) in rat kidneys. Foetuses, newborn, suckling, weaning and adult rats were used. The apical membranes of foetal and newborn rat kidneys express OCTN2 transport activity, which is up-regulated by age. Maturation significantly increased the V(max) of this transport system without changing the apparent K(t), which excludes a maturation-related expression of different transporter isoforms. Northern analysis showed a 3.7kb transcript for OCTN2 in all the ages tested. Northern and RT-PCR assays revealed that maturation increased renal expression of OCTN2 mRNA. Foetuses express TMABA-DH mRNA and this expression increased during postnatal life. BBH mRNA, however, was detected during the suckling period onwards and its abundance was not changed significantly by maturation. This study reports for the first time that, in rat kidneys: (i) an apical OCTN2 transporter is active in rat foetuses, (ii) ontogeny up-regulates OCTN2 activity by increasing the density and/or turnover of the transporters, (iii) the maturation-related changes in OCTN2 are in part mediated by transcriptional mechanism(s) and (iv) the expression of both, TMABA-DH and BBH mRNA is ontogenically regulated.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of mildronate in rats following focal cerebral ischemia. Male Wistar rats were subjected to transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) for 90min, followed by the intraperitoneal administration of mildronate at doses of 100 and 200mg/kg 2h after reperfusion and then daily for an additional 14days. The beam-walking, rota-rod and cylinder tests were used to assess sensorimotor function, and vibrissae-evoked forelimb-placing and limb-placing tests examined responses to tactile and proprioceptive stimulation. Following behavioural testing, the infarct volume was measured. The cerebellar concentrations of l-carnitine, γ-butyrobetaine (GBB) and mildronate were also measured. The results showed that saline-treated MCAO rats had minor or no spontaneous recovery in sensorimotor and proprioceptive function up to 14days post-stroke. Treatment with mildronate at a dose of 200mg/kg was found to accelerate recovery of motor and proprioceptive deficits in limb-placing, cylinder and beam-walking tests. Analysis of rat cerebellar tissue extracts revealed that l-carnitine and GBB concentrations changed with mildronate treatment; the concentration of l-carnitine was significantly decreased by mildronate treatment, whereas the concentration of GBB was significantly increased. Cerebellar concentrations of mildronate also increased in a dose-dependent manner following systemic administration. Infarct size did not differ among the experimental groups on post-stroke day 14.

PPARalpha-responsive genes were markedly upregulated in the liver (P<0.05), moderately in small intestine, but only slightly in other extrahepatic tissues by clofibrate. Relative mRNA concentration of OCTN2 in liver and small intestine was increased in rats fed clofibrate (P<0.05), whereas in other extrahepatic tissues mRNA concentration of OCTN2 did not differ between treatment groups. Concentration of total carnitine was higher in liver and small intestine but lower in plasma, kidney, and brain of rats fed clofibrate (P<0.05). Moreover, concentration of the carnitine precursor trimethyllysine and mRNA concentrations of specific genes involved in carnitine biosynthesis were increased in livers of rats fed clofibrate (P<0.05).

Each subunit binds NAD(+) as a coenzyme, contains a solvent-accessible C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal (type 1) and a cation bound in the cavity close to the NAD(+) binding site. While the NAD(+) binding mode is classical for PsAMADH2, that for PsAMADH1 is unusual among ALDHs. A glycerol molecule occupies the substrate binding site and mimics a bound substrate. Structural analysis and substrate specificity study of both isoenzymes in combination with data published previously on other ALDH9 family members show that the established categorization of such enzymes into distinct groups based on substrate specificity is no more appropriate, because many of them seem capable of oxidizing a large spectrum of aminoaldehyde substrates. PsAMADH1 and PsAMADH2 can oxidize N,N,N-trimethyl-4-aminobutyraldehyde into , which is the carnitine precursor in animal cells. This activity highly suggests that in addition to their contribution to the formation of compatible osmolytes such as glycine betaine, beta-alanine betaine and gamma-aminobutyric acid, AMADHs might participate in carnitine biosynthesis in plants.(c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, pivalate supplementation has been linked with increased renal and hepatic trimethyllysine hydroxylase (TMLH) activity, whereas carnitine supplementation has been associated with significantly decreased hepatic  hydroxylase (BBH) activity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether pivalate or carnitine supplementation affects the activity and genetic expression of 2 enzymes of carnitine (Cn) biosynthesis, TMLH and BBH, expressed as mRNA abundance, relative to the abundance of beta-actin mRNA. Male weanling rats were administered the control treatment (C; n = 6), the pivalate treatment (P; n = 7), or the pivalate treatment plus supplemental dietary carnitine (P+Cn; n = 7). Rats in group P had elevated renal TMLH activity, relative to the other groups (P < 0.05). The groups did not differ in the abundance of renal or hepatic TMLH or BBH mRNA. A previously unreported finding was the quantifiable level of renal BBH mRNA, which was verified by direct sequencing of the BBH cDNA product amplified from kidney RNA. The groups did not differ in renal BBH mRNA abundance and renal BBH enzyme activity was not detected. Thus, the alterations in enzyme activities in the pivalate-treated rats are not regulated at the transcriptional level, and are apparently related to post-transcriptional effects on the enzymes themselves.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9324401>[Comparative study of the antioxidant activity of  and its natural and synthetic derivatives in vitro].</a></h2><p>Experiments in vitro with the use of a rat brain homogenate demonstrated antioxidant activity of methyl ether (3(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium) propionate possessing a positive charge at the quaternary nitrogen atom.

In the present study, we compared the cardioprotective effect of mildronate (100 mg/kg) and a combination of mildronate and L-carnitine (100 + 100 mg/kg) administered for 14 days with respect to the observed changes in l-carnitine level and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I)-dependent fatty acid  in the heart tissues. Concentrations of L-carnitine and its precursor γ-butyrobetaine (GBB) were measured by ultraperformance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, mitochondrial respiration, activity of CPT-I, and expression of CPT-IA/B messenger RNA (mRNA) were measured. Isolated rat hearts were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Administration of mildronate induced a 69% decrease in L-carnitine concentration and a 6-fold increase in GBB concentration in the heart tissue as well as a 27% decrease in CPT-I-dependent mitochondrial respiration on palmitoyl-coenzyme A. In addition, mildronate treatment induced a significant reduction in infarct size and also diminished the ischemia-induced respiration stimulation by exogenous cytochrome c. Treatment with a combination had no significant impact on L-carnitine concentration, CPT-I-dependent mitochondrial respiration, and infarct size.

The aim of our study was to analyze metabolite alterations after supplementation of BET, polydextrose (PDX, a soluble dietary fiber), or their combination (BET PDX) via drinking water to C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat (HF) diet.BET supplementation increased BET levels in plasma, muscle, and liver (p < 0.05), and the nontargeted LC-MS metabolite profiling revealed an increase in several metabolites in the carnitine biosynthesis pathway after BET supplementation both in liver and muscle. These included carnitine and acetylcarnitine (1.4-fold, p < 0.05), propionylcarnitine and γ-butyrobetaine (1.5-fold, p < 0.05), and several other short-chain acylcarnitines (p < 0.05) in muscle. These changes were slightly higher in the BET PDX group. Furthermore, BET reduced the HF diet induced accumulation of triglycerides in liver (p < 0.05). The supplementations did not attenuate the HF diet induced increase in body weight gain or the increase in adipose tissue mass. Instead, the combination of BET and PDX tended to increase adiposity.Our results suggest that increased availability of BET in different tissues, especially in muscle, after BET supplementation has an impact on carnitine , and this could further explain the link between BET and lipid .© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

One part of this catabolic pathway is reversible and can be utilized for bioproduction of large amounts of stereochemically pure L-carnitine, which is used medically for the treatment of a variety of human diseases. Here, we present the crystal structure of the E. coli protein CaiB, which is a member of the recently identified type-III coenzyme A (CoA) transferase family and catalyzes the transfer of the CoA moiety between -CoA and carnitine forming carnityl-CoA and . This is the first protein from the carnitine  pathway to be structurally characterized. The structure of CaiB reveals a spectacular fold where two monomers are interlaced to form an interlocked dimer. A molecule of the crystallization buffer bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)imino-tris(hydroxymethyl)methane (bis-tris) is bound in a large pocket located primarily in the small domain, and we propose that this pocket constitutes the binding site for both substrate moieties participating in the CaiB transfer reaction. The binding of CoA to CaiB induces a domain movement that closes the active site of the protein. This is the first observation of a domain movement in the type-III CoA transferase family and can play an important role in coupling substrate binding to initiation of the catalytic reaction.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26371012>A Phospholipid-Protein Complex from Antarctic Krill Reduced Plasma Homocysteine Levels and Increased Plasma Trimethylamine-N-Oxide (TMAO) and Carnitine Levels in Male Wistar Rats.</a></h2><p>Seafood is assumed to be beneficial for cardiovascular health, mainly based on plasma lipid lowering and anti-inflammatory effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, other plasma risk factors linked to cardiovascular disease are less studied. This study aimed to penetrate the effect of a phospholipid-protein complex (PPC) from Antarctic krill on one-carbon metabolism and production of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in rats. Male Wistar rats were fed isoenergetic control, 6%, or 11% PPC diets for four weeks. Rats fed PPC had reduced total homocysteine plasma level and increased levels of choline, dimethylglycine and cysteine, whereas the plasma level of methionine was unchanged compared to control. PPC feeding increased the plasma level of TMAO, carnitine, its precursors trimethyllysine and γ-butyrobetaine. There was a close correlation between plasma TMAO and carnitine, trimethyllysine, and γ-butyrobetaine, but not between TMAO and choline. The present data suggest that PPC has a homocysteine lowering effect and is associated with altered plasma concentrations of metabolites related to one-carbon metabolism and B-vitamin status in rats. Moreover, the present study reveals a non-obligatory role of gut  in the increased plasma TMAO level as it can be explained by the PPC's content of TMAO.

Hepatocytes from rats treated with 20 mmol/L of pivalate for 4 wk had greater L-[(14)C] carnitine uptake than those of unsupplemented rats after 5, 10, 30 and 90 min. Addition of 1 mmol/L of pivalate or 1 mmol/L of pivaloylcarnitine to control cell suspensions did not affect L-[(14)C] carnitine uptake.

Therefore, an experiment with twenty young pigs with an average body weight of 21 kg was performed which were fed either a control diet (9.7 g lysine/kg) or a diet with a moderate excess of lysine (16.8 g lysine/kg). Concentrations of all the other amino acids did not differ between the diets. Pigs fed the high-lysine diet had lower concentrations of free and total carnitine in plasma, liver, kidney and skeletal muscle than control pigs (P<0.05). Pigs fed the high-lysine diet moreover had an increased concentration of trimethyllysine (TML), a reduced mRNA abundance of TML dioxygenase and reduced concentrations of  (BB) in muscle, indicating that the conversion of TML into BB in muscle was impaired. Concentrations of BB, the  precursor of carnitine, in plasma, liver and kidney were also reduced in pigs fed the high-lysine diet while the activity of BB dioxygenase in kidney was not different and that in liver was even increased compared to control pigs (P<0.05). In conclusion, this study shows that a moderate dietary excess of lysine lowers plasma and tissue carnitine concentrations in pigs. Reduced concentrations of BB in liver and kidney suggest that the depressed carnitine status was likely caused by a decreased rate of carnitine synthesis due to a diminished availability of carnitine precursor, probably mainly as a result of an impaired BB formation in muscle.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16300828>L-carnitine is synthesized in the human fetal-placental unit: potential roles in placental and fetal .</a></h2><p>Carnitine plays an indispensable role in fatty acid oxidation.

LCFA lipotoxicity causes mitochondrial damage and results in an insufficient energy supply and a decrease in l-carnitine content limits LCFA flux and protects mitochondria. Here, we tested whether the inhibition of GBB dioxygenase (BBOX) or organic cation transporter 2 (OCTN2) is the most effective strategy to decrease l-carnitine content. The activity of 51 compounds was tested and we identified selective inhibitors of OCTN2. In contrast to selective inhibitors of BBOX, OCTN2 inhibitors induced a 10-fold decrease in l-carnitine content in the heart tissues and a significant 35% reduction of myocardial infarct size. In addition, OCTN2 inhibition correlated with the inhibitor content in the heart tissues, and OCTN2 could potentially be an efficient target to increase drug transport into tissues and to reduce drug elimination by urine. In conclusion, the results of this study confirm that selective inhibition of OCTN2, compared to selective inhibition of BBOX, is a far more effective approach to decrease l-carnitine content and to induce cardioprotective effects.

Although the mutation of the OCTN2 gene has been proved to be directly related to primary carnitine deficiency, there is little information about the L-carnitine transport system in the liver. In this study, the characteristics of L-carnitine transport into hepatocytes were studied by use of cultured human hepatoma HLF cells, which expressed OCTN2 mRNA to a greater extent than OCTN1 mRNA. The uptake of L-carnitine into HLF cells was saturable and the Eadie-Hofstee plot showed two distinct components. The apparent Michaelis constant and the maximum transport rate were 6.59+/-1.85 microM (mean+/-s.d.) and 78.5+/-21.4 pmol/5 min/10(6) cells, respectively, for high-affinity uptake, and 590+/-134 microM and 1507+/-142 pmol/5 min/10(6) cells, respectively, for low-affinity uptake. The high affinity L-carnitine transporter was significantly inhibited by  inhibitors (sodium azide, dinitrophenol, iodoacetic acid) and at low temperature (4 degrees C). Uptake of [3H]L-carnitine also required the presence of Na+ ions in the external medium. The uptake activity was highest at pH 7.4, and was significantly lower at acidic or basic pH. L-Carnitine analogues (D-carnitine, L-acetylcarnitine and ) strongly inhibited uptake of [3H] L-carnitine, whereas beta-alanine, glycine, choline, acetylcholine and an organic anion and cation had little or no inhibitory effect. In conclusion, L-carnitine is absorbed by hepatocytes from man by an active carrier-mediated transport system which is Na+-, energy- and pH-dependent and has properties very similar to those of the carnitine transporter OCTN2.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20637671>ESI-MS/MS measurement of free carnitine and its precursor γ-butyrobetaine in plasma and dried blood spots from patients with organic acidurias and fatty acid oxidation disorders.</a></h2><p>In patients with fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAODs) and organic acidurias (OAs) "secondary carnitine deficiency" occurs.

Supplemented patients had high free carnitine concentrations in combination with high γ-butyrobetaine concentrations. Unsupplemented carnitine palmitoyltransferase I-deficient patients had exceptionally high free carnitine concentrations without elevated γ-butyrobetaine, however, carnitine in plasma was much lower than in DBS. In patients with low carnitine, γ-butyrobetaine in plasma is no evidence of induced carnitine biosynthesis.Parallel measurements in plasma and DBS demonstrated that numerous patients with low values in DBS had normal values when measured in plasma, suggesting plasma to be the more appropriate medium to use for carnitine status monitoring.

Recent evidence suggests carnitine requirements increase under conditions of sustained  stress. Accordingly, we hypothesized that carnitine insufficiency might contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and obesity-related impairments in glucose tolerance. Consistent with this prediction whole body carnitine diminution was identified as a common feature of insulin-resistant states such as advanced age, genetic diabetes, and diet-induced obesity. In rodents fed a lifelong (12 month) high fat diet, compromised carnitine status corresponded with increased skeletal muscle accumulation of acylcarnitine esters and diminished hepatic expression of carnitine biosynthetic genes. Diminished carnitine reserves in muscle of obese rats was accompanied by marked perturbations in mitochondrial fuel , including low rates of complete fatty acid oxidation, elevated incomplete beta-oxidation, and impaired substrate switching from fatty acid to pyruvate. These mitochondrial abnormalities were reversed by 8 weeks of oral carnitine supplementation, in concert with increased tissue efflux and urinary excretion of acetylcarnitine and improvement of whole body glucose tolerance. Acetylcarnitine is produced by the mitochondrial matrix enzyme, carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT). A role for this enzyme in combating glucose intolerance was further supported by the finding that CrAT overexpression in primary human skeletal myocytes increased glucose uptake and attenuated lipid-induced suppression of glucose oxidation. These results implicate carnitine insufficiency and reduced CrAT activity as reversible components of the  syndrome.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16365043>Oligomeric structure of the carnitine transporter CaiT from Escherichia coli.</a></h2><p>The carnitine transporter CaiT from Escherichia coli belongs to the betaine, choline, and carnitine transporter family of secondary transporters. It acts as an L-carnitine/ exchanger and is predicted to span the membrane 12 times. Unlike the other members of this transporter family, it does not require an ion gradient and does not respond to osmotic stress (Jung, H., Buchholz, M., Clausen, J., Nietschke, M., Revermann, A., Schmid, R., and Jung, K.

Blue native gel electrophoresis indicated that CaiT was a trimer in detergent solution. This result was further supported by gel filtration and cross-linking studies. Electron microscopy and single particle analysis of the protein showed a triangular structure of three masses or two parallel elongated densities. Reconstitution of CaiT into lipid bilayers yielded two-dimensional crystals that indicated that CaiT was a trimer in the membrane, similar to its homologue BetP.

Recent studies showed that administration of the plasma lipid-lowering drug niacin causes activation of PPARα and/or PPARδ in tissues of obese Zucker rats, which have a compromised carnitine status and an impaired fatty acid oxidation capacity. Thus, we hypothesized that niacin administration to obese Zucker rats is also able to improve the diminished carnitine status of obese Zucker rats through PPAR-mediated stimulation of genes involved in carnitine uptake and biosynthesis.To test this hypothesis, we used plasma, muscle and liver samples from a recent experiment with obese Zucker rats, which were fed either a niacin-adequate diet (30 mg niacin/kg diet) or a diet with a pharmacological niacin dose (780 mg niacin/kg diet), and determined concentrations of carnitine in tissues and mRNA and protein levels of genes critical for carnitine homeostasis (OCTN2, BBD, TMABA-DH). Statistical data analysis of all data was done by one-way ANOVA, and Fisher's multiple range test.Rats of the obese niacin group had higher concentrations of total carnitine in plasma, skeletal muscle and liver, higher mRNA and protein levels of OCTN2, BBD, and TMABA-DH in the liver and higher mRNA and protein levels of OCTN2 in skeletal muscle than those of the obese control group (P < 0.05), whereas rats of the obese control group had lower concentrations of total carnitine in plasma and skeletal muscle than lean rats (P < 0.05).The results show for the first time that niacin administration stimulates the expression of genes involved in carnitine uptake and biosynthesis and improves the diminished carnitine status of obese Zucker rats.

The enzyme crotonobetainyl/gamma-butyrobetainyl-CoA:carnitine CoA-transferase (CaiB; E.C. 2.8.3.-) catalyzes the first step in carnitine , leading to the final product . The crystal structures of Escherichia coli apo-CaiB, as well as its Asp169Ala mutant bound to CoA and to carnitinyl-CoA, have been determined and refined to 1.6, 2.4, and 2.4 A resolution, respectively. CaiB is composed of two identical circular chains that together form an intertwined dimer. Each monomer consists of a large domain, containing a Rossmann fold, and a small domain. The monomer and dimer resemble those of formyl-CoA transferase from Oxalobacter formigenes, as well as E. coli YfdW, a putative type-III CoA transferase of unknown function. The CoA cofactor-binding site is formed at the interface of the large domain of one monomer and the small domain from the second monomer. Most of the protein-CoA interactions are formed with the Rossmann fold domain. While the location of cofactor binding is similar in the three proteins, the specific CoA-protein interactions vary somewhat between CaiB, formyl-CoA transferase, and YfdW. CoA binding results in a change in the relative positions of the large and small domains compared with apo-CaiB. The observed carnitinyl-CoA product in crystals of the CaiB Asp169Ala mutant cocrystallized with crotonoyl-CoA and carnitine could result from (i) a catalytic mechanism involving a ternary enzyme-substrate complex, independent of a covalent anhydride intermediate with Asp169, (ii) a spontaneous reaction of the substrates in solution, followed by binding to the enzyme, or (iii) an involvement of another residue substituting functionally for Asp169, such as Glu23.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25220864>Expression and purification of active, stabilized trimethyllysine hydroxylase.</a></h2><p>Trimethyllysine hydroxylase (TMLH) catalyses the first step in carnitine biosynthesis - the conversion of N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-l-lysine to 3-hydroxy-N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-l-lysine.

JVS mice showed higher fractional excretions not only of L-carnitine but also of gamma-BB and acetyl L-carnitine than control mice, indicating disturbed reabsorption of gamma-BB and acetyl L-carnitine. The disturbed reabsorption of gamma-BB in JVS mice is consistent with the fact that the amount of urinary gamma-BB in JVS mice was four times that of control. The sum of the concentrations of L-carnitine, acetyl L-carnitine and gamma-BB in the urine of JVS mice was not significantly different from that of the control, suggesting no remarkable increase of biosynthesis of gamma-BB and carnitine in JVS mice.

The mechanisms may be either a facilitated urinary excretion or an inhibited biosynthesis. Based on our earlier findings with drugs and benzoic acid analogue metabolites, in the present study, we studied the possible inhibitory effect of some benzoic acid analogue drugs. In the pathway of carnitine biosynthesis, we tested the last step, the hydroxylation of  (Bu) to carnitine in the liver. (Liver is the only organ in rats where this step takes place.) Of the 5 tested compounds, the p-aminomethylbenzoic acid (PAMBA) was found to be inhibitory. In tracer experiments with radioactive Bu, PAMBA (a single injection of 1.2 mmol/kg) reduced the conversion of [Me-(3)H]Bu to [Me-(3)H]carnitine from 62.6% +/- 5.11% to 46.8% +/- 5.02% (means +/- SEM, P < .02). This single dose also markedly reduced the conversion of loading amount of exogenous unlabeled Bu, as measured by enzymatic analysis of carnitine. The conversion of endogenous Bu was also hampered by long-term administration of PAMBA, as indicated by increased Bu and decreased carnitine levels. Furthermore, single injection of PAMBA markedly reduced the Glu level in the liver from 2.87 +/- 0.17 to 1.42 +/- 0.11 mumol/g (P < .001). Trying to get closer to a mechanism by which the flux through the Bu hydroxylase was depressed, we supposed that alfa-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG), an obligatory cofactor of the enzyme, was also be depressed. It was expected because alpha-KG is a reversible copartner of l-glutamate through the Glu-dehydrogenase reaction. We found that PAMBA reduced the alpha-KG level from 207 +/- 17.5 to 180 +/- 19.1 nmol/g (means +/- SEM, P < .02).

The left coronary artery of the animals was ligated, and the rats were then orally administered vehicle (control), MET-88 at 50 or 100 mg/kg or captopril at 20 mg/kg for 20 days. Myocytes were isolated from the non-infarcted region in the left ventricle, and cell shortening and [Ca2+]i transients were measured with a video-edge detector and by fluorescence analysis, respectively. In CHF control rats, the diastolic phase of cell shortening was prolonged compared with that of the sham-operated (sham) rats. This prolongation was prevented by treatment with MET-88 at 100 mg/kg or captopril at 20 mg/kg. CHF control rats also showed an increase in the decay time of [Ca2+]i transients compared with sham rats. MET-88 at 100 mg/kg and captopril at 20 mg/kg attenuated the increase in decay time of [Ca2+]i transients. Ca2+ uptake activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) isolated from the non-infarcted region in the left ventricle was measured, and Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis of the activity was performed. CHF control rats revealed a decrease in the Vmax for SR Ca2+ uptake activity without alteration in Kd. MET-88 at 100 mg/kg significantly prevented the decrease in Vmax, but had no effect on Kd. Also, treatment with MET-88 at 100 mg/kg improved myocardial high-energy phosphate levels impaired in CHF rats.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of mildronate administration to pregnant and lactating rats on tissue carnitine concentrations in 4- and 13-day-old rat pups. At 14 days of gestation female rats began to receive mildronate in the diet (200 mg/kg/d) and this continued for entire lactation period. Mildronate treatment determined a large reduction of carnitine levels in the milk of lactating dams. Because organ carnitine concentrations in neonatal rats are directly related to dietary supply, pups from mildronate group had significantly depleted levels of total carnitine in serum, heart, liver, muscle, brain and pancreas relative to controls, at 4 and 13 days of age.

This complex maturation process of the Bbox1 mRNAs in the liver was studied on rats fed a high-fat diet. High-fat diet selectively increased the level of three Bbox1 mRNA isoforms in rat liver and the alternative use of polyadenylation sites contributed to the global increase in Bbox1 enzymatic activity and l-carnitine levels.

In balanced growth cultures at 7 degrees C, glycine betaine (720 nmol/10(10) cfu) and carnitine (130 nmol/10(10) cfu) were the major osmolytes accumulated by wild-type L. monocytogenes 10403S, whereas carnitine (490 nmol/10(10) cfu) was the dominant osmolyte and glycine betaine was present in smaller amounts (270 nmol/10(10) cfu) in a mutant (L. monocytogenes LTG59) blocked in the major glycine betaine uptake system, glycine betaine porter II. In strain 10403S, glycine betaine and carnitine were present in eightfold and twofold excess at 7 degrees C compared to 30 degrees C; the respective ratios for strain LTG59 were 6 and 8. The intracellular concentration of osmolytes in stationary phase cultures at 7 degrees C was markedly reduced compared to that during balanced growth. Furthermore, at 4 degrees C, small but highly significant differences in growth were observed between strains. Strain LTG59 grew with a lag phase that was significantly longer, a generation time that was significantly greater and reached a final cell yield that was significantly lower than that of strain 10403S. The elevated accumulation of carnitine in the absence of glycine betaine porter II was insufficient to confer the magnitude of the cryoprotective effect displayed by the wild type.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19491916>Carnitine status of pregnant women: effect of carnitine supplementation and correlation between iron status and plasma carnitine concentration.</a></h2><p>It has been shown that plasma carnitine concentrations markedly decline during gestation in women. The reason for this, however, is unknown. One objective of this study was to investigate the effect of carnitine supplementation on plasma carnitine concentrations in pregnant women. The second objective was to investigate the hypothesis that reduced plasma carnitine concentrations during gestation are caused by a reduced carnitine synthesis because of a diminished iron status.Healthy pregnant women (n=26) were randomly assigned in two groups receiving either a L-carnitine supplement (500 mg L-carnitine per day as L-carnitine L-tartrate) (n=13) or placebo (n=13) from the 13th week of gestation to term.In the control group, there was a marked reduction of plasma carnitine concentration from the 12th week of gestation to term. This reduction was prevented by the supplementation of carnitine. In the control group, there was a positive relationship between the parameters of iron status (mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and ferritin) and plasma concentration of carnitine (P<0.05). Moreover, there were inverse correlations between the concentrations of ferritin and the carnitine precursor  in plasma, and between  and carnitine in plasma (P<0.05).This study confirms that plasma carnitine concentrations decline in the course of pregnancy, an effect that can be prevented by the supplementation of carnitine. Data of this study, moreover, suggest that the decline of plasma carnitine concentration during pregnancy could be caused by a reduced rate of carnitine biosynthesis, possibly because of an inadequate iron status.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11891565>Functional characterization of intestinal L-carnitine transport.</a></h2><p>The carnitine transporter OCTN2 is responsible for the renal reabsorption of filtered L-carnitine. However, there is controversy regarding the intestinal L-carnitine transport mechanism(s). In this study, the characteristics of L-carnitine transport in both, isolated chicken enterocytes and brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) were studied. In situ hybridization was also performed in chicken small intestine. Chicken enterocytes maintain a steady-state L-carnitine gradient of 5 to 1 and 90% of the transported L-carnitine remains in a readily diffusive form. After 5 min, L-Carnitine uptake into BBMV overshot the equilibrium value by a factor of 2.5. Concentrative L-carnitine transport is Na+-, membrane voltage-and pH-dependent, has a high affinity for L-carnitine (Km 26 - 31 microM ) and a 1:1 Na+: L-carnitine stoichiometry. L-Carnitine uptake into either enterocytes or BBMV was inhibited by excess amount of cold L-carnitine > D-carnitine = acetyl-L-carnitine =  > palmitoyl-L-carnitine > betaine > TEA, whereas alanine, histidine, GABA or choline were without significant effect. In situ hybridization studies revealed that only the cells lining the intestinal villus expressed OCTN2 mRNA. This is the first demonstration of the operation of a Na+/L-carnitine cotransport system in the apical membrane of enterocytes. This transporter has properties similar to those of OCTN2.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21168767>Structural and mechanistic studies on γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase.</a></h2><p>The final step in carnitine biosynthesis is catalyzed by γ-butyrobetaine (γBB) hydroxylase (BBOX), an iron/2-oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent oxygenase. BBOX is inhibited by trimethylhydrazine-propionate (THP), a clinically used compound. We report structural and mechanistic studies on BBOX and its reaction with THP. Crystallographic and sequence analyses reveal that BBOX and trimethyllysine hydroxylase form a subfamily of 2OG oxygenases that dimerize using an N-terminal domain. The crystal structure reveals the active site is enclosed and how THP competes with γBB. THP is a substrate giving formaldehyde (supporting structural links with histone demethylases), dimethylamine, malonic acid semi-aldehyde, and an unexpected product with an additional carbon-carbon bond resulting from N-demethylation coupled to oxidative rearrangement, likely via an unusual radical mechanism.

During acute exercise, the increased demand for FAs results in a state of free carnitine deficiency in plasma. The role of kidney in carnitine homeostasis after exercise is not known.Swiss Webster mice were sacrificed immediately after a 1-hour moderate intensity treadmill run, and at 4-hours and 8-hours into recovery. Non-exercising mice served as controls. Plasma was analyzed for carnitine using acetyltransferase and [14C] acetyl-CoA. Kidney was removed for gene and protein expression of butyrobetaine hydroxylase (γ-BBH), organic cation transporter (OCTN2), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα), a regulator of fatty acid oxidation activated by FAs.Acute exercise caused a decrease in plasma free carnitine levels. Rapid return of free carnitine to control levels during recovery was associated with increased γ-BBH expression. Both mRNA and protein levels of OCTN2 were detected in kidney after exercise and during recovery, suggesting renal transport mechanisms were stimulated. These changes were accompanied with a reciprocal increase in PPARα protein expression.Our results show that the decrease in free carnitine after exercise rapidly activates carnitine biosynthesis and renal transport mechanism in kidney to establish carnitine homeostasis.© 2017 The Author(s).

Whether other genes encoding enzymes involved in the carnitine synthesis pathway, such as 4-N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (TMABA-DH) and trimethyllysine dioxygenase (TMLD), are also direct PPARα target genes is less clear. In silico-analysis of the mouse TMLD promoter and first intron and the TMABA-DH promoter revealed several putative peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPRE) with high similarity to the consensus PPRE. Luciferase reporter gene assays using either a 2kb TMLD promoter or a 4kb TMLD first intron reporter constructs revealed no functional PPRE. In contrast, reporter gene assays using wild-type and mutated 5´-truncation TMABA-DH promoter reporter constructs showed that one PPRE located at position -132 in the proximal promoter is probably functional. Using gel shift assays we observed in vitro-binding of PPARα to this PPRE. Moreover, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays we found that PPARα also binds in vivo to a nucleotide sequence spanning the PPRE at -132, which confirms that this PPRE is functional. In conclusion, the present study shows that the mouse TMABA-DH gene is a direct PPARα target gene. Together with the recent identification of the mouse BBD and the mouse OCTN2 genes as PPARα target genes this finding confirm that PPARα plays a key role in the regulation of carnitine homeostasis by controlling genes involved in carnitine synthesis and carnitine uptake.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, the enzyme activities involved in the biotransformation process of crotonobetaine into L(-)-carnitine (crotonobetaine hydration reaction and crotonobetaine reduction reaction), in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA (pyruvate dehydrogenase, acetyl-CoA synthetase, and ATP:acetate phosphotransferase) and in the distribution of metabolites for the tricarboxylic acid (isocitrate dehydrogenase) and glyoxylate (isocitrate lyase) cycles, were followed in batch with both growing and resting cells and during continuous cell growth in stirred-tank and high-cell-density membrane reactors. In addition, the levels of carnitine, crotonobetaine, , ATP, NADH/NAD(+), and acetyl-CoA/CoA ratios were measured to determine how  fluxes were distributed in the catabolic system. The results provide the first experimental evidence demonstrating the important role of the glyoxylate shunt during biotransformation of resting cells and the need for high levels of ATP to maintain metabolite transport and biotransformation (2.1 to 16.0 mmol L cellular/mmol ATP L reactor h). Moreover, the results obtained for the pool of acetyl-CoA/CoA indicate that it also correlated with the biotransformation process. The main  pathway operating during cell growth in the high cell-density membrane reactor was that related to isocitrate dehydrogenase (during start-up) and isocitrate lyase (during steady-state operation), together with phosphotransacetylase and acetyl-CoA synthetase.

Of phenylacetic acid (PEAA), phenylpyruvic acid and homogentisic acid the PEAA was found to be the most effective in inhibiting carnitine biosynthesis in rats. Following 60 min, a single intraperitoneal dose of PEAA the relative conversion rate, i. e. the hydroxylation, of tracer [Me-(3)H]butyrobetaine to [Me-(3)H]carnitine decreased from 62.2+/-6.00% to 39.4+/-5.11% (means+/-S.E.M., P<0.01) in the liver, in the only organ doing this conversion in rats. The conversion of loading amount of unlabeled butyrobetaine to carnitine was also markedly reduced. The impaired hydroxylation of butyrobetaine was reflected by a reduced free and total carnitine levels in the liver and a reduced total carnitine concentration in the plasma. PEAA decreased the hepatic level of glutamic acid and alpha-ketoglutaric acid (alpha-KG), suggesting a mechanism for the reduced flux through the butyrobetaine hydroxylase enzyme, because alpha-KG is an obligatory co-enzyme.

It was suggested that increased mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation in the liver of Wistar rats results in reduced plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) levels. Here we assessed the potential of TTA to prevent tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α-induced lipid modifications in human TNFα (hTNFα) transgenic mice. These mice are characterized by reduced β-oxidation and changed fatty acid composition in the liver. The effect of dietary treatment with TTA on persistent, low-grade hTNFα overexpression in mice showed a beneficial effect through decreasing TAG plasma concentrations and positively affecting saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid proportions in the liver, leading to an increased anti-inflammatory fatty acid index in this group. We also observed an increase of mitochondrial β-oxidation in the livers of TTA treated mice. Concomitantly, there were enhanced plasma levels of carnitine, acetyl carnitine, propionyl carnitine, and octanoyl carnitine, no changed levels in trimethyllysine and palmitoyl carnitine, and a decreased level of the precursor for carnitine, called γ-butyrobetaine.

However, the transporter has not been molecularly identified. In this study, we screened a human kidney cDNA library and assembled a cDNA-encoding OCTN2 as a homologue of the organic cation transporter OCTN1, and then we examined the function of OCTN2 as a carnitine transporter. OCTN2-cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 557 amino acids with 75.8% similarity to OCTN1. Northern blot analysis showed that OCTN2 is strongly expressed in kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, and placenta in adult humans. When OCTN2 was expressed in HEK293 cells, uptake of L-[3H]carnitine was strongly enhanced in a sodium-dependent manner with Km value of 4.34 microM, whereas typical substrates for previously known organic cation transporters, tetraethylammonium and guanidine, were not good substitutes. OCTN2-mediated L-[3H]carnitine transport was inhibited by the D-isomer, acetyl-D,L-carnitine, and  with high affinity and by glycinebetaine with lower affinity, whereas choline, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, lysine, and taurine were not inhibitory. Because the observed tissue distribution of OCTN2 is consistent with the reported distribution of carnitine transport activity and the functional characteristics of OCTN2 coincide with those reported for plasma membrane carnitine transport, we conclude that OCTN2 is a physiologically important, high affinity sodium-carnitine cotransporter in humans.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18758058>Vitamin C is not essential for carnitine biosynthesis in vivo: verification in vitamin C-depleted senescence marker protein-30/gluconolactonase knockout mice.</a></h2><p>Carnitine is an essential cofactor in the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix and plays an important role in energy production via beta-oxidation.

Our present study using senescence marker protein-30 (SMP30)/gluconolactonase (GNL) knockout (KO) mice, which cannot synthesize VC in vivo, led to the conclusion that this notion is not true.

The total VC levels in all tissues and plasma from VC(-) SMP30/GNL KO mice were negligible, i.e., <2% of the levels in SMP30/GNL KO VC(+) mice; however, the total carnitine levels of both groups were similar in all tissues and serum. In addition, carnitine was produced by incubated liver homogenates from the VC-depleted SMP30/GNL KO mice irrespective of the presence or absence of 1 mM VC.

Uptake of carnitine by primary-cultured epididymal epithelial cells was time, Na(+) and concentration dependent. Kinetic analysis of carnitine uptake by the cells revealed the involvement of high- and low-affinity transport systems with Km values of 21 microM and 2.2 mM respectively. The uptake of carnitine by the cells was significantly reduced by inhibitors of carnitine/organic cation transporter (OCTN2), such as carnitine analogues and cationic compounds. In RT-PCR analysis, OCTN2 expression was detected. These results demonstrated that the high-affinity carnitine transporter OCTN2, which is localized at the basolateral membrane of epididymal epithelial cells, mediates carnitine supply into those cells from the systemic circulation as the first step of permeation from blood to spermatozoa.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16972171>Prolonged moderate-intensity exercise without and with L-carnitine supplementation in patients with MCAD deficiency.</a></h2><p>Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is probably the most common inborn error of fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Routine L-carnitine supplementation in the treatment of MCADD is controversial. To establish the effects of L-carnitine supplementation during prolonged moderate-intensity exercise in MCADD, five patients and three control subjects were studied during 2 hours of moderate-intensity exercise after a 12-hour fast. Patients were studied twice, once with and once without L-carnitine supplementation (50 mg/kg per day). Blood samples were collected before, during and after exercise, and analysed for routine parameters, acylcarnitines and carnitine biosynthesis intermediates. Urine was collected before and after exercise, and analysed for acylcarnitines. All patients were able to complete the exercise test without any apparent clinical or biochemical adverse effects, even without L-carnitine supplementation. A significant rise in plasma free fatty acids and octanoylcarnitine levels during exercise was seen in all patients, indicating a substantial increase in FAO during exercise. Octanoylcarnitine levels in plasma were significantly higher in patients with L-carnitine supplementation, suggesting increased clearance of accumulating acylcarnitines. A statistically significant increase of plasma and urinary free carnitine levels, as well as of plasma  was seen in MCADD patients without L-carnitine supplementation. These data suggest an increase in carnitine biosynthesis. In conclusion, although L-carnitine supplementation may promote clearance of accumulating acylcarnitines during moderate-intensity exercise, no apparent beneficial effect of this supplementation on clinical and biochemical parameters was observed in MCADD patients. Our results suggest that MCADD patients are able to increase carnitine biosynthesis during exercise to compensate for carnitine losses.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6466296> in tissues and serum of fed and starved rats determined by an enzymic radioisotopic procedure.</a></h2><p>A method for the determination of picomole quantities of  and its application for the determination of  distribution in tissues are described.

By inhibiting the biosynthesis of carnitine, mildronate is supposed to induce the accumulation of GBB, a substrate of GBB hydroxylase. This study describes the changes in content of carnitine and GBB in rat plasma and heart tissues during long-term (28 days) treatment of mildronate [i.p. (intraperitoneal) 100 mg/kg/daily]. Obtained data show that in concert with a decrease in carnitine concentration, the administration of mildronate caused a significant increase in GBB concentration. We detected about a 5-fold increase in GBB contents in the plasma and brain and a 7-fold increase in the heart. In addition, we tested the cardioprotective effect of mildronate in isolated rat heart infarction model after 3, 7, and 14 days of administration. We found a statistically significant decrease in necrotic area of infarcted rat hearts after 14 days of treatment with mildronate.

Comparison of immuno-staining intensity of HeLa OCTN1 with the purified recombinant human OCTN1 allowed measuring the specific OCTN1 concentration in the HeLa cell extract and, hence calculating the HeLa OCTN1 specific transport activity that was about 10 nmol×min(-1)×mg protein(-1), measured as uptake of [(3)H]acetylcholine in proteoliposomes reconstituted with HeLa extract. This value was very similar to the specific activity of the recombinant protein. Acetylcholine transport was suppressed by incubation of the protein or proteoliposomes with the anti-OCTN1 antibody and was strongly inhibited by PLP and MTSEA, known inhibitors of OCTN1. The absence of ATP in the internal side of proteoliposomes strongly impaired transport function of both the HeLa and, as expected, the recombinant OCTN1. HeLa OCTN1 was inhibited by spermine, NaCl (Na(+)), TEA, γ-butyrobetaine, choline, acetylcarnitine and ipratropium but not by neostigmine. Besides acetylcholine, choline was taken up by HeLa OCTN1 proteoliposomes. The transporter catalyzed also acetylcholine and choline efflux which, differently from uptake, was not inhibited by MTSEA.

The biotransformation of crotonobetaine into L-carnitine by resting cells of E. coli O44 K74 was improved by salt stress, a yield of nearly twofold that for the control being obtained with 0.5 M NaCl. Crotonobetaine and the L-carnitine formed acted as an osmoprotectant during cell growth and biotransformation in the presence of NaCl. The enzyme activities involved in the biotransformation process (crotonobetaine hydration reaction and crotonobetaine reduction reaction), in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA/acetate (pyruvate dehydrogenase, acetyl-CoA synthetase [ACS] and ATP/acetate phosphotransferase) and in the distribution of metabolites for the tricarboxylic acid cycle (isocitrate dehydrogenase [ICDH]) and glyoxylate shunt (isocitrate lyase [ICL]) were followed in batch with resting cells both in the presence and absence of NaCl and in perturbation experiments performed on growing cells in a high density cell recycle membrane reactor. Further, the levels of carnitine, crotonobetaine,  and ATP and the NADH/NAD(+) ratio were measured in order to know how the  state was modified and coenzyme pools redistributed as a result of NaCl's effect on the energy content of the cell. The results provided the first experimental evidence of the important role played by salt stress during resting and growing cell biotransformation (0.5 M NaCl increased the L-carnitine production in nearly 85%), and the need for high levels of ATP to maintain metabolite transport and biotransformation. Moreover, the main   and carbon flow operating during cell biotransformation was that controlled by the ICDH/ICL ratio, which decreased from 8.0 to 2.5, and the phosphotransferase/ACS ratio, which increased from 2.1 to 5.2, after a NaCl pulse fivefold the steady-state level. Resting E. coli cells were seen to be made up of heterogeneous populations consisting of several types of subpopulation (intact, depolarized, and permeabilized cells) differing in viability and  activity as biotransformation run-time and the NaCl concentration increased.

The presence of L-carnitine decreased the degree of drug-induced apoptosis and suppressed adipogenic differentiation. Metabolomic analysis by means of the exhaustive investigation of metabolic products showed that, in addition to increased β-oxidation and the expression of all carnitine derivatives other than  (an intermediate in carnitine synthesis), polysaturated and polyunsaturated acids were down-regulated. An integrated analysis incorporating both serial analysis of gene expression and metabolomics revealed increases in cell survival, suggesting the utility of carnitine. The addition of carnitine elevated the oxygen consumption rate by BmMSCs that had been cultured for only a few generations and those that had become senescent following repeated replication indicating that mitochondrial activation occurred.

Does improved metabolic health and insulin sensitivity following a weight-loss and fitness intervention in sedentary, obese women alter exercise-associated fuel  and incomplete mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO), as tracked by blood acylcarnitine patterns? What is the main finding and its importance? Despite improved fitness and blood sugar control, indices of incomplete mitochondrial FAO increased in a similar manner in response to a fixed load acute exercise bout; this indicates that intramitochondrial muscle FAO is inherently inefficient and is tethered directly to ATP turnover. With insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes mellitus, mismatches between mitochondrial fatty acid fuel delivery and oxidative phosphorylation/tricarboxylic acid cycle activity may contribute to inordinate accumulation of short- or medium-chain acylcarnitine fatty acid derivatives [markers of incomplete long-chain fatty acid oxidation (FAO)]. We reasoned that incomplete FAO in muscle would be ameliorated concurrent with improved insulin sensitivity and fitness following a ∼14 week training and weight-loss intervention in obese, sedentary, insulin-resistant women. Contrary to this hypothesis, overnight-fasted and exercise-induced plasma C4-C14 acylcarnitines did not differ between pre- and postintervention phases. These metabolites all increased robustly with exercise (∼45% of pre-intervention peak oxygen consumption) and decreased during a 20 min cool-down. This supports the idea that, regardless of insulin sensitivity and fitness, intramitochondrial muscle β-oxidation and attendant incomplete FAO are closely tethered to absolute ATP turnover rate. Acute exercise also led to branched-chain amino acid acylcarnitine derivative patterns suggestive of rapid and transient diminution of branched-chain amino acid flux through the mitochondrial branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. We confirmed our prior novel observation that a weight-loss/fitness intervention alters plasma xenometabolites [i.e. cis-3,4-methylene-heptanoylcarnitine and γ-butyrobetaine (a co-metabolite possibly derived in part from gut bacteria)], suggesting that host metabolic health regulated gut microbe . Finally, we considered whether acylcarnitine metabolites signal to muscle-innervating afferents; palmitoylcarnitine at concentrations as low as 1-10 μm activated a subset (∼2.5-5%) of these neurons ex vivo. This supports the hypothesis that in addition to tracking exercise-associated shifts in fuel , muscle acylcarnitines act as signals of exertion to short-loop somatosensory-motor circuits or to the brain.© 2016 The Authors.

We investigated the hypothesis that genes of carnitine synthesis and uptake in dairy cows are enhanced during early lactation.mRNA abundances of PPARA and some of its classical target genes and genes involved in carnitine biosynthesis [trimethyllysine dioxygenase (TMLHE), 4-N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH9A1), γ-butyrobetaine dioxygenase (BBOX1)] and uptake of carnitine [novel organic cation transporter 2 (SLC22A5)] as well as carnitine concentrations in liver biopsy samples of 20 dairy cows in late pregnancy (3 wk prepartum) and early lactation (1 wk, 5 wk, 14 wk postpartum) were determined. From 3 wk prepartum to 1 wk postpartum, mRNA abundances of PPARΑ and several PPARΑ target genes involved in fatty acid uptake, fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis in the liver were strongly increased. Simultaneously, mRNA abundances of enzymes of carnitine synthesis (TMLHE: 10-fold; ALDH9A1: 6-fold; BBOX1: 1.8-fold) and carnitine uptake (SLC22A5: 13-fold) and the concentration of carnitine in the liver were increased from 3 wk prepartum to 1 wk postpartum (P < 0.05).

Long-term pre-treatment that decreases carnitine and LCAC contents also reduces ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) damage; however, the duration of the post-treatment effects is not known. The aim of the study was to assess the post-treatment effects of the carnitine transport (OCTN2) inhibitor, methyl-GBB, on LCAC content and the duration of its cardioprotective effect. Male Wistar rats received methyl-GBB (5 mg/kg for 28 days), and the anti-infarction effects on Langendorff-perfused hearts and the acylcarnitine profile in cardiac tissues were measured up to 28 days following the end of the treatment. Methyl-GBB pre-treatment for 28 days decreased LCAC heart tissue content by 87%, and the infarct size was decreased by 57%. Fourteen days post-treatment, the LCAC content was still decreased by 69%, and the infarct size was decreased by 32% compared to Control. A significant Pearson correlation (r = 0.48, p = 0.026) was found between infarct size and LCAC tissue content in the methyl-GBB-treated rat hearts. The addition of 2 mM carnitine to isolated heart perfusate significantly diminished the methyl-GBB-induced decrease in LCACs and infarct size. In conclusion, the anti-infarction effect of methyl-GBB continues for at least 2 weeks post-treatment. No less than a 70% decrease in LCAC content is required to protect ischaemic heart tissues, and the decrease in LCAC levels defines the duration of the post-treatment cardioprotective effect of the OCTN2 inhibitor, methyl-GBB.© 2017 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society).</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15731894>Identification and functional characterisation of genes and corresponding enzymes involved in carnitine  of Proteus sp.</a></h2><p>Enzymes involved in carnitine  of Proteus sp. are encoded by the cai genes organised as the caiTABCDEF operon. The complete operon could be sequenced from the genomic DNA of Proteus sp. Amino acid sequence similarities and/or enzymatic analysis confirmed the function assigned to each protein involved in carnitine . CaiT was suggested to be an integral membrane protein responsible for the transport of betaines. The caiA gene product was shown to be a crotonobetainyl-CoA reductase catalysing the irreversible reduction of crotonobetainyl-CoA to gamma-butyrobetainyl-CoA. CaiB and CaiD were identified to be the two components of the crotonobetaine hydrating system, already described. CaiB and caiD were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. After purification of both proteins, their individual enzymatic functions were solved. CaiB acts as betainyl-CoA transferase specific for carnitine, crotonobetaine,  and its CoA derivatives. Transferase reaction proceeds, following a sequential bisubstrate mechanism. CaiD was identified to be a crotonobetainyl-CoA hydratase belonging to the crotononase superfamily. Because of amino acid sequence similarities, CaiC was suggested to be a betainyl-CoA ligase.

The exact mechanisms of disease progression are unclear, with limited work done using metabolite profiling to study disease progression.The aim of this pilot study was to profile the plasma metabolomics in an animal model of Y. pestis infection.In this study, African Green monkeys were challenged with the highly virulent, aerosolized Y. pestis strain CO92, and untargeted metabolomics profiling of plasma was performed using liquid and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry.At early time points post-exposure, we found significant increases in polyunsaturated, long chain fatty acid metabolites with p values ranging from as low as 0.000001 (ratio = 1.94) for the metabolite eicosapentaenoate to 0.04 (ratio = 1.36) for the metabolite adrenate when compared to time-matched controls. Multiple acyl carnitines metabolites were increased at earlier time points and could be a result of fatty acid oxidation defects with p values ranging from as low as 0.00001 (ratio = 2.95) for the metabolite octanoylcarnitine to 0.04 (ratio = 1.33) for metabolite  when compared to time-matched controls. Dicarboxylic acids are important metabolic products of fatty acids oxidation, and when compared to time matched controls, were higher at earlier time points where metabolite tetradecanedioate has a ratio of 4.09 with significant p value of 0.000002 and adipate with a ratio of 1.12 and p value of 0.004.

Recently, a potent inhibitor of l-carnitine biosynthesis and transport, methyl-γ-butyrobetaine (methyl-GBB), was discovered. In this study, we evaluated the effects of γ-butyrobetaine (GBB), l-carnitine and methyl-GBB administration on the progression of atherosclerosis.Apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE(-/-)) mice were treated with methyl-GBB, l-carnitine or GBB for 4months. Following the treatment, the amount of atherosclerotic lesions, the number of immune cells in atherosclerotic lesions and the plasma lipid profile were analysed. The l-carnitine and acylcarnitine levels were determined in the aortic tissues of CD-1 outbred mice 2weeks after treatment with methyl-GBB at the dose of 10mg/kg.Treatment with methyl-GBB decreased the acylcarnitine and l-carnitine levels in the aortic tissues by seventeen- and ten-fold, respectively. Methyl-GBB treatment at a dose of 10mg/kg reduced the size of atherosclerotic plaques by 36%. Neither l-carnitine nor GBB treatment affected the development of atherosclerosis.Methyl-GBB administration significantly attenuated the development of atherosclerosis in apoE(-/-)mice.

We performed randomized-controlled dietary intervention studies to explore the impact of chronic dietary patterns on TMAO levels, metabolism and renal excretion.Volunteers (N = 113) were enrolled in a randomized 2-arm (high- or low-saturated fat) crossover design study. Within each arm, three 4-week isocaloric diets (with washout period between each) were evaluated (all meals prepared in metabolic kitchen with 25% calories from protein) to examine the effects of red meat, white meat, or non-meat protein on TMAO metabolism. Trimethylamine N-oxide and other trimethylamine (TMA) related metabolites were quantified at the end of each diet period. A random subset (N = 13) of subjects also participated in heavy isotope tracer studies. Chronic red meat, but not white meat or non-meat ingestion, increased plasma and urine TMAO (each >two-fold; P < 0.0001). Red meat ingestion also significantly reduced fractional renal excretion of TMAO (P < 0.05), but conversely, increased fractional renal excretion of carnitine, and two alternative gut -generated metabolites of carnitine, γ-butyrobetaine, and crotonobetaine (P < 0.05). Oral isotope challenge revealed red meat or white meat (vs. non-meat) increased TMA and TMAO production from carnitine (P < 0.05 each) but not choline. Dietary-saturated fat failed to impact TMAO or its metabolites.Chronic dietary red meat increases systemic TMAO levels through: (i) enhanced dietary precursors; (ii) increased microbial TMA/TMAO production from carnitine, but not choline; and (iii) reduced renal TMAO excretion.

However, existing methods of assessing dietary intake in nutritional epidemiology rely on food frequency questionnaires or dietary records that are prone to bias and selective reporting. Herein, metabolic phenotyping was performed on 42 healthy participants from the Diet and Gene Intervention (DIGEST) pilot study, a parallel two-arm randomized clinical trial that provided complete diets to all participants. Matching single-spot urine and fasting plasma specimens were collected at baseline, and then following two weeks of either a Prudent or Western diet with a -maintaining menu plan designed by a dietician. Targeted and nontargeted metabolite profiling was conducted using three complementary analytical platforms, where 80 plasma metabolites and 84 creatinine-normalized urinary metabolites were reliably measured (CV < 30%) in the majority of participants (>75%) after implementing a rigorous data workflow for metabolite authentication with stringent quality control. We classified a panel of metabolites with distinctive trajectories following two weeks of food provisions when using complementary univariate and multivariate statistical models. Unknown metabolites associated with contrasting dietary patterns were identified with high-resolution MS/MS, as well as co-elution after spiking with authentic standards if available. Overall, 3-methylhistidine and proline betaine concentrations increased in both plasma and urine samples after participants were assigned a Prudent diet ( < 0.05) with a corresponding decrease in the Western diet group. Similarly, creatinine-normalized urinary imidazole propionate, hydroxypipecolic acid, dihydroxybenzoic acid, and enterolactone glucuronide, as well as plasma ketoleucine and ketovaline increased with a Prudent diet ( < 0.05) after adjustments for age, sex, and BMI. In contrast, plasma myristic acid, linoelaidic acid, linoleic acid, α-linoleic acid, pentadecanoic acid, alanine, proline, carnitine, and , as well as urinary acesulfame K increased among participants following a Western diet. Most metabolites were also correlated ( > ± 0.30,  < 0.05) to changes in the average intake of specific nutrients from self-reported diet records reflecting good adherence to assigned food provisions.

Many follow a low-phenylalanine (low-Phe) diet devoid of animal protein in combination with medical foods (MFs).To assess lipid metabolism in participants with PKU consuming amino acid MFs (AA-MFs) or glycomacropeptide MFs (GMP-MFs), we conducted fatty acid and metabolomics analyses.We used subsets of fasting plasma and urine samples from our randomized crossover trial in which participants with early-treated classical and variant (milder) PKU consumed a low-Phe diet combined with AA-MFs or GMP-MFs for 3 wk each. Fatty acid profiles of red blood cell (RBC) membranes were determined for 25 adults (aged 18-49 y) with PKU and 143 control participants. Metabolomics analyses of plasma and urine samples were conducted by Metabolon for 9-10 adolescent and adult participants with PKU and for 15 control participants.RBC fatty acid profiles were not significantly different with AA-MFs or GMP-MFs.

In this pilot study we determined if krill oil could favourable affect plasma lipid parameters and parameters involved in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis.The study was conducted as a 28 days intervention study examining effect-parameters of dietary supplementation with krill oil (832.5 mg EPA and DHA per day). 17 healthy volunteers in the age group 18-36 (mean age 23 ± 4 years) participated. Plasma lipids, lipoprotein particle sizes, fatty acid composition in plasma and red blood cells (RBCs), plasma cytokines, antioxidant capacity, acylcarntines, carnitine, choline, betaine, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) were measured before and after supplementation.Plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) and large very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) & chylomicron particle concentrations decreased after 28 days of krill oil intake. A significant reduction in the TAG/HDL cholesterol resulted. Krill oil supplementation decreased n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio both in plasma and RBCs. This was due to increased EPA, DHA and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and reduced amount of arachidonic acid (AA). The increase of n-3 fatty acids and wt % of EPA and DHA in RBC was of smaller magnitude than found in plasma. Krill oil intake increased the antioxidant capacity, double bond index (DBI) and the fatty acid anti-inflammatory index. The plasma atherogenicity index remained constant whereas the thrombogenicity index decreased. Plasma choline, betaine and the carnitine precursor, γ-butyrobetaine were increased after krill oil supplementation whereas the TMAO and carnitine concentrations remained unchanged.Krill oil consumption is considered health beneficial as it decreases cardiovascular disease risk parameters through effects on plasma TAGs, lipoprotein particles, fatty acid profile, redox status and possible inflammation.

Participants completed two weeks of step reduction (<1000 steps/day) followed by a two week recovery period, where fasting plasma samples were collected at three time intervals at baseline, after step reduction and following recovery. Two weeks of step reduction elicited increases in circulatory metabolites associated with a decline in muscle energy metabolism and protein degradation, including glutamine, carnitine and creatine ( < 0.05; effect size > 0.30), as well as methionine and  ( < 0.05; effect size ≈ 0.20) as compared to baseline.

Our results indicate that older persons are susceptible to metabolic perturbations due to short-term step reduction that were not fully reversible with resumption of normal ambulatory activity over the same time period.

Dams suckling their litters, irrespective of litter size, had lower relative messenger RNA concentrations of PPARalpha, various classic PPARalpha target genes involved in fatty acid catabolism, as well as enzymes involved in carnitine synthesis (trimethyllysine dioxygenase, 4-N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase,  dioxygenase) and OCTN1 in the liver than dams whose litters were removed (P < .05). Moreover, dams suckling their litters had a reduced activity of  dioxygenase in the liver and reduced concentrations of carnitine in plasma, liver, and muscle compared with dams without litters (P < .05). In conclusion, the present study demonstrates for the first time that lactation leads to a down-regulation of PPARalpha and genes involved in hepatic carnitine synthesis and uptake of carnitine (OCTN1) in the liver, irrespective of litter size. It is moreover suggested that down-regulation of PPARalpha in the liver may be a means to conserve energy and  substrates for milk production in the mammary gland.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20416111>Low availability of carnitine precursors as a possible reason for the diminished plasma carnitine concentrations in pregnant women.</a></h2><p>It has been shown that plasma carnitine concentrations decrease markedly during gestation. A recent study performed with a low number of subjects suggested that this effect could be due to a low iron status which leads to an impairment of carnitine synthesis. The present study aimed to confirm this finding in a greater number of subjects. It was moreover intended to find out whether low carnitine concentrations during pregnancy could be due to a reduced availability of precursors of carnitine synthesis, namely trimethyllysine (TML) and  (BB).Blood samples of 79 healthy pregnant women collected at delivery were used for this study.There was only a weak, non-significant (P > 0.05), correlation between plasma concentration of ferritin and those of free and total carnitine. There was no correlation between other parameters of iron status (plasma iron concentration, hemoglobin, MCV, MCH) and plasma concentration of free and total carnitine. There were, however, significant (P < 0.05) positive correlations between concentrations of TML and BB and those of free and total carnitine in plasma.The results of this study suggest that an insufficient iron status is not the reason for low plasma carnitine concentrations observed in pregnant women. It is rather indicated that low plasma carnitine concentrations are caused by a low availability of precursors for carnitine synthesis during gestation.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9893954>Hypolipidaemic effects of fenofibrate are not altered by mildronate-mediated normalization of carnitine concentration in rat liver.</a></h2><p>The five-fold higher carnitine content in the liver of fenofibrate-treated rats addresses the question about the possible role of this enhancement in the hypolipidaemic effect of the drug and the underlying mechanisms. When fenofibrate was administered with mildronate (a  hydroxylase inhibitor) in suitable amount, the content in carnitine was found to be normalized in liver. However, triglyceride contents of liver and serum were then at least as low as in rats treated by fenofibrate only. When carnitine concentration was lowered by mildronate to the third of the normal value, a marked increase in triglycerides occurred both in liver and serum, while the five-fold increase in carnitine due to fenofibrate enhanced blood ketone body concentration with no effect on liver and serum triglycerides. Data suggest that the normal carnitine concentration is largely sufficient to meet the usual requirement for carnitine palmitoyltransferase I activity (CPT I). In rat liver, increase in mitochondrial CPT I activity and in peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation may constitute part of the hypolipidaemic effect of fenofibrate.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24098955>A fish protein hydrolysate alters fatty acid composition in liver and adipose tissue and increases plasma carnitine levels in a mouse model of chronic inflammation.</a></h2><p>There is growing evidence that fish protein hydrolysate (FPH) diets affect mitochondrial fatty acid  in animals. The aim of the study was to determine if FPH could influence fatty acid  and inflammation in transgene mice expressing human tumor necrosis factor alpha (hTNFα).hTNFα mice (C57BL/6 hTNFα) were given a high-fat (23%, w/w) diet containing 20% casein (control group) or 15% FPH and 5% casein (FPH group) for two weeks. After an overnight fast, blood, adipose tissue, and liver samples were collected. Gene expression and enzyme activity was analysed in liver, fatty acid composition was analyzed in liver and ovarian white adipose tissue, and inflammatory parameters, carnitine, and acylcarnitines were analyzed in plasma.The n-3/n-6 fatty acid ratio was higher in mice fed the FPH diet than in mice fed the control diet in both adipose tissue and liver, and the FPH diet affected the gene expression of ∆6 and ∆9 desaturases. Mice fed this diet also demonstrated lower hepatic activity of fatty acid synthase. Concomitantly, a lower plasma INF-γ level was observed. Plasma carnitine and the carnitine precursor γ-butyrobetaine was higher in the FPH-group compared to control, as was plasma short-chained and medium-chained acylcarnitine esters. The higher level of plasma acetylcarnitine may reflect a stimulated mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation of fatty acids, as the hepatic activities of peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 1 and mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase-II were higher in the FPH-fed mice.The FPH diet was shown to influence hepatic fatty acid  and fatty acid composition.

Its homeostasis is achieved through oral intake, renal reabsorption and de novo biosynthesis. Unlike dietary intake and renal reabsorption, the importance of de novo biosynthesis pathway in carnitine homeostasis remains unclear, due to lack of animal models and description of a single patient defective in this pathway.We identified by array comparative genomic hybridization a 42 months-old girl homozygote for a 221 Kb interstitial deletions at 11p14.2, that overlaps the genes encoding Fibin and butyrobetaine-gamma 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase 1 (BBOX1), an enzyme essential for the biosynthesis of carnitine de novo. She presented microcephaly, speech delay, growth retardation and minor facial anomalies. The levels of almost all evaluated metabolites were normal. Her serum level of free carnitine was at the lower limit of the reference range, while her acylcarnitine to free carnitine ratio was normal.We present an individual with a completely defective carnitine de novo biosynthesis. This condition results in mildly decreased free carnitine level, but not in clinical manifestations characteristic of carnitine deficiency disorders, suggesting that dietary carnitine intake and renal reabsorption are sufficient to carnitine homeostasis.

Separation of the 65 acylcarnitines was accomplished in a single chromatogram in as little as 14 min. Validation studies were performed showing a high level of accuracy, precision, and reproducibility.

Plasma and urine samples were collected weekly. Daily meat consumption within an average, non-vegetarian diet was monitored. l-Carnitine, γ-butyrobetaine and mildronate concentrations were measured using the UPLC/MS/MS method.After 4 weeks, the average concentrations of l-carnitine in plasma significantly decreased by 18%. The plasma concentrations of γ-butyrobetaine increased about two-fold, and this effect was statistically significant in both the male and female groups. In urine samples, a significant increase in l-carnitine and γ-butyrobetaine levels was observed, which provides evidence for increased excretion of both substances during the mildronate treatment. At the end of the treatment period, the plasma concentration of mildronate was 20µm on average. There were no significant differences between the effects observed in female and male volunteers. Meat consumption partially reduced the l-carnitine-lowering effects induced by mildronate.Long-term administration of mildronate significantly lowers l-carnitine plasma concentrations in non-vegetarian, healthy volunteers.© 2011 The Authors.

This enzyme was purified from rat liver, and two internal peptide fragments were sequenced by Edman degradation. The peptide sequences were used to search the Expressed Sequence Tag data base, which led to the identification of a rat cDNA containing an open reading frame of 1485 base pairs encoding a polypeptide of 494 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 55 kDa. Expression of the coding sequence in Escherichia coli confirmed that the cDNA encodes gamma-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase. The previously identified human aldehyde dehydrogenase 9 (EC 1.2.1.19) has 92% identity with rat trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase and has been reported to convert substrates that resemble gamma-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde. When aldehyde dehydrogenase 9 was expressed in E. coli, it exhibited high trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase activity. Furthermore, comparison of the enzymatic characteristics of the heterologously expressed human and rat dehydrogenases with those of purified rat liver trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase revealed that the three enzymes have highly similar substrate specificities. In addition, the highest V(max)/K(m) values were obtained with gamma-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde as substrate. This indicates that human aldehyde dehydrogenase 9 is the gamma-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase, which functions in carnitine biosynthesis.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16707092>Measurement of carnitine biosynthesis enzyme activities by tandem mass spectrometry: differences between the mouse and the rat.</a></h2><p>Although the mouse frequently is used to study  and deficiencies therein, little is known about carnitine biosynthesis in this animal. To this point, only laborious procedures have been described to measure the activity of carnitine biosynthesis enzymes using subcellular fractions as the enzyme source. We developed two simple tandem mass spectrometry-based methods to determine the activity of three carnitine biosynthesis enzymes (6-N-trimethyllysine dioxygenase, 4-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase, and 4-trimethylaminobutyric acid dioxygenase) in total homogenates that can be prepared from frozen tissue. The new assays were used to characterize these enzymes in mouse liver homogenate. Because carnitine biosynthesis has been studied extensively in the rat, we compared the mouse tissue distribution of carnitine biosynthesis enzyme activities and levels of the biosynthesis metabolites with those in the rat to determine which tissues contribute to carnitine biosynthesis in these species. Surprisingly, large differences in enzyme activities were found between the rat and the mouse, whereas carnitine biosynthesis metabolite levels were very similar in both species, possibly due to the different kinetic properties of the first enzyme of carnitine biosynthesis. Also, muscle carnitine levels were found to vary considerably between these two species, suggesting that there is a  dissimilarity between the mouse and the rat.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12406761>Gbu glycine betaine porter and carnitine uptake in osmotically stressed Listeria monocytogenes cells.</a></h2><p>The food-borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes grows actively under high-salt conditions by accumulating compatible solutes such as glycine betaine and carnitine from the medium. We report here that the dominant transport system for glycine betaine uptake, the Gbu porter, may act as a secondary uptake system for carnitine, with a K(m) of 4 mM for carnitine uptake and measurable uptake at carnitine concentrations as low as 10 microM. This porter has a K(m) for glycine betaine uptake of about 6 micro M. The dedicated carnitine porter, OpuC, has a K(m) for carnitine uptake of 1 to 3 microM and a V(max) of approximately 15 nmol/min/mg of protein. Mutants lacking either opuC or gbu were used to study the effects of four carnitine analogs on growth and uptake of osmolytes. In strain DP-L1044, which had OpuC and the two glycine betaine porters Gbu and BetL, triethylglycine was most effective in inhibiting growth in the presence of glycine betaine, but trigonelline was best at inhibiting growth in the presence of carnitine. Carnitine uptake through OpuC was inhibited by . Dimethylglycine inhibited both glycine betaine and carnitine uptake through the Gbu porter. Carnitine uptake through the Gbu porter was inhibited by triethylglycine. Glycine betaine uptake through the BetL porter was strongly inhibited by trigonelline and triethylglycine. These results suggest that it is possible to reduce the growth of L. monocytogenes under osmotically stressful conditions by inhibiting glycine betaine and carnitine uptake but that to do so, multiple uptake systems must be affected.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18801379>Mildronate decreases carnitine availability and up-regulates glucose uptake and related gene expression in the mouse heart.</a></h2><p>l-carnitine has been shown to play a central role in both fat and carbohydrate metabolisms.

An isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was used to determine L-carnitine levels in liver samples. When compared with dry period, during pregnancy, free and acid-soluble total carnitine concentrations did not change significantly (p>0.05). In contrast to free and acid-soluble total carnitine, short chain acylcarnitine concentration increased significantly in the second period of pregnancy, compared with non-pregnant rabbits. Highest concentrations of free, short-chain acyl- and acid-soluble total carnitine were measured at the 4th day of lactation (487 +/- 29; 392 +/- 26 and 879 +/- 38 nmol/g wet weight respectively).  hydroxylase activity increased with the duration of pregnancy and in late pregnancy it increased significantly compared to previous periods. Highest activity was measured in early lactation period (361 +/- 28 pmol carnitine/min/mg protein).

An experiment with 18 pigs was performed which were fed a control diet or the same diet supplemented with 5 g clofibrate/kg for 28 days.

Mildronate was designed to inhibit carnitine biosynthesis in order to prevent accumulation of cytotoxic intermediate products of fatty acid beta-oxidation in ischemic tissues and to block this highly oxygen-consuming process. Mildronate is efficient in the treatment of heart ischemia and its consequences. Extensive evaluation of pharmacological activities of mildronate revealed its beneficial effect on cerebral circulation disorders and central nervous system (CNS) functions. The drug is used in neurological clinics for the treatment of brain circulation disorders. It appears to improve patients' mood; they become more active, their motor dysfunction decreases, and asthenia, dizziness and nausea become less pronounced. Since the brain does not utilize fatty acids as fuel other mechanisms of action of mildronate in CNS should be considered. Several reports indicate the possible existence of an alternative, non-carnitine dependent mechanism of action of mildronate. Our recent findings suggest that CNS effects of mildronate could be mediated by stimulation of the nitric oxide production in the vascular endothelium by modification of the  and its esters pools. It is hypothesized that mildronate may increase the formation of the  esters. The latter are potent cholinomimetics and may activate eNOS via acetylcholine receptors or specific  ester receptors.

However, the identification of BBD as a direct PPARα target gene as well as its exact regulation remained to be demonstrated. In silico-analysis of the mouse BBD promoter revealed seven putative peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPRE) with high similarity to the consensus PPRE. Luciferase reporter gene assays using mutated and non-mutated serial 5'-truncation BBD promoter reporter constructs revealed that one PPRE located at -75 to -87 relative to the transcription start site in the proximal BBD promoter is probably functional. Using gel shift assays we observed in vitro-binding of PPARα/RXRα heterodimer to this PPRE confirming that it is functional. In conclusion, the present study clearly shows that mouse BBD is a direct PPARα target gene and that transcriptional up-regulation of mouse BBD by PPARα is likely mediated by binding of the PPARα/RXR heterodimer to one PPRE located in its proximal promoter region. The results confirm emerging evidence from recent studies that PPARα plays a key role in the regulation of carnitine homeostasis by controlling genes involved in both, carnitine synthesis and carnitine uptake.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.
