The   composition of the lipid membrane of L. acidophilus La-5 was significantly different upon growth in MRS (containing Tween 80, an  source), or in MRS with Tween 20 (containing C12:0 and C14:0), linoleic, or linolenic  supplemented. Bacteria grown in MRS showed the highest storage survival rates. No indications of loss of membrane integrity could be found, and membrane integrity could therefore not be connected with loss of viability. Survival of bacteria grown with linoleic or linolenic  was more negatively affected by the presence of oxygen, than bacteria grown in MRS or with Tween 20 supplemented. A small, but significant, loss of linolenic  during storage could be identified, and an increase of  secondary oxidation products during storage was found for bacteria grown in MRS, or with linoleic, or linolenic  supplemented, but not for bacteria grown with Tween 20. Overall, the results indicate that lipid oxidation and loss of membrane integrity are not the only or most important detrimental reactions which can occur during storage. By altering the   composition, it was also found that properties of  gave rise to more robust bacteria than more saturated or unsaturated   did.© 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29173641>Microbial biodiversity of Sardinian  ecosystems.</a></h1><p>The olives are rich in microorganisms that, during the extraction process may persist in the oils and can influence their physicochemical and sensory characteristics. In this work, and for the first time, we isolated and identified microbial species, yeast and bacteria, present during the production process in four Sardinian (Italy)  ecosystems. Among these varieties, we found that Nera di Gonnos was associated to the highest microbial biodiversity, which was followed by Bosana, Nocellara del Belice and Semidana. Among the different microbial species isolated, some are specific of olive ecological niches, such as Cryptococcus spp and Serratia spp; and others to olive oils such as Candida spp and Saccharomyces. Some other species identified in this work were not found before in  ecosystems. The enzymatic analyses of yeast and bacteria showed that they have good β-glucosidase activity and yeast also showed good β-glucanase activity. The majority of bacteria presented lipolytic and catalase activities while in yeast were species-specific. Interestingly, yeast and bacteria isolates presented a high resistance to bile , and about 65% of the yeast were able to resist at pH 2.5 for 2 h. Finally, bacteria showed no biofilm activity compared to yeast.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of supplementing MLM growth medium with C18 free fatty acids (C-FFAs), including stearic (C18:0),  (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2), and linolenic (C18:3) , on the growth of Lactobacillus plantarum CICC21001 by forming ion pairs with lysine to increase the solubility of FAs in liquid medium. The utilization of C-FFAs was further confirmed by GC-FID. The investigation of cell properties, including cell surface hydrophobicity and zeta potential, was carried out for the modified L. plantarum and control group (non-supplementation). Furthermore, cell survival was measured in real time under heat (at 55 and 62 °C for 5 min),  (pH 2.2), and bile salt stress. Our results indicated that the action of L. plantarum was modulated by assimilating C-FFAs. This study suggested that C-FFAs altered the life cycles and physiochemical properties of L. plantarum, which provided a guideline for  production and their medical application.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30139411>Review: Modulating ruminal lipid metabolism to improve the fatty  composition of meat and milk. Challenges and opportunities.</a></h1><p>Growth in demand for foods with potentially beneficial effects on consumer health has motivated increased interest in developing strategies for improving the nutritional quality of ruminant-derived products. Manipulation of the rumen environment offers the opportunity to modify the lipid composition of milk and meat by changing the availability of fatty acids (FA) for mammary and intramuscular lipid uptake. Dietary supplementation with marine lipids, plant secondary compounds and direct-fed microbials has shown promising results. In this review, we have compiled information about their effects on the concentration of putative desirable FA (e.g. c9t11-CLA and vaccenic, , linoleic and linolenic acids) in ruminal digesta, milk and intramuscular fat. Marine lipids rich in very long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) efficiently inhibit the last step of C18 FA biohydrogenation (BH) in the bovine, ovine and caprine, increasing the outflow of t11-18:1 from the rumen and improving the concentration of c9t11-CLA in the final products, but increments in t10-18:1 are also often found due to shifts toward alternative BH pathways. Direct-fed microbials appear to favourably modify rumen lipid metabolism but information is still very limited, whereas a wide variety of plant secondary compounds, including tannins, polyphenol oxidase, essential oils, oxygenated FA and saponins, has been examined with varying success. For example, the effectiveness of tannins and essential oils is as yet controversial, with some studies showing no effects and others a positive impact on inhibiting the first step of BH of PUFA or, less commonly, the final step. Further investigation is required to unravel the causes of inconsistent results, which may be due to the diversity in active components, ruminant species, dosage, basal diet composition and time on treatments. Likewise, research must continue to address ways to mitigate negative side-effects of some supplements on animal performance (particularly, milk fat depression) and product quality (e.g. altered oxidative stability and shelf-life).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29851067>Quality of ready-to-eat swordfish fillets inoculated with Lactobacillus paracasei IMPC 2.1.</a></h1><p>The quality of marinated ready-to-eat (RTE) swordfish fillets, with or without inoculation with the probiotic strain Lactobacillus paracasei IMPC 2.1, was assessed over 3 months of refrigerated storage at 4 °C. RTE probiotic and control fish fillets were sampled after 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90 days of storage. Microbiological tests were performed, and fatty  (FA) profiles and malondialdehyde content were examined. Microbiological counts, including total viable count, lactic  bacteria (LAB), yeasts, moulds, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae were determined.Inoculation successfully ensured the growth of the probiotic strain and prevented the growth of other LAB. The two RTE products showed significant differences in lipid profile and lipid oxidation during storage. In particular, inoculation with L. paracasei IMPC 2.1 increased the amount of polyunsaturated FAs and limited the amount of monounsaturated FAs and , as well as lipid oxidation. It thus represents an interesting strategy for preserving the chemical quality of fish fillets and an alternative means of delivering .Probiotic inoculation with Lactobacillus paracasei seemed to delay lipid oxidation of the fish flesh and increase the retention of polyunsaturated FAs, suggesting a potential application for this strain in the seafood industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30349012>Effect of Pufa Substrates on Fatty  Profile of Bifidobacterium breve Ncimb 702258 and CLA/CLNA Production in Commercial Semi-Skimmed Milk.</a></h1><p>Current research on lipids is highlighting their relevant role in metabolic/signaling pathways. Conjugated fatty acids (CFA), namely isomers of linoleic and linolenic  (i.e. CLA and CLNA, respectively) can positively modulate inflammation processes and energy metabolism, promoting anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant effects, improved lipid profiles and insulin resistance, among others. Bioactive doses have been indicated to be above 1 g/d, yet these cannot be achieved through a moderate intake (i.e. 1-2 servings) of natural sources, and certain CLA-containing products have limited commercial availability. Such handicaps have fueled research interest in finding alternative fortification strategies. In recent years, screening of dairy products for CFA-producing bacteria has attracted much attention and has led to the identification of some promising strains, including Bifidobacterium breve NCIMB 702258. This strain has shown interesting producing capabilities in model systems as well as positive modulation of lipid metabolism activities in animal studies. Accordingly, the aim of this research work was to assay B. breve NCIMB 702258 in semi-skimmed milk to produce a probiotic fermented dairy product enriched in bioactive CLA and CLNA. The effect of substrates (LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA) on growth performance and membrane fatty acids profile was also studied, as these potential modifications have been associated to stress response. When tested in cys-MRS culture medium, LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA impaired the fatty  synthesis by B. breve since membrane concentrations for stearic and  acids decreased. Variations in the C18:1 c11 and lactobacillic  concentrations, may suggest that these substrates are also affecting the membrane fluidity. Bifidobacterium breve CFA production capacity was first assessed in cys-MRS with LA, α-LNA, γ-LNA or all substrates together at 0.5 mg/mL each. This strain did not produce CFA from γ-LNA, but converted 31.12% of LA and 68.20% of α-LNA into CLA and CLNA, respectively, after incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. In a second phase, B. breve was inoculated in a commercial semi-skimmed milk with LA, α-LNA or both at 0.5 mg/mL each. Bifidobacterium breve revealed a limited capacity to synthesize CLA isomers, but was able to produce 0.062-0.115 mg/mL CLNA after 24 h at 37 °C. However, organoleptic problems were reported which need to be addressed in future studies. These results show that although CFA were produced at too low concentrations to be able to achieve solely the bioactive dose in one daily portion size, fermented dairy products are a suitable vector to deliver B. breve NCIMB 702258.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30096901>Characterization of Antibacterial Cell-Free Supernatant from Oral Care Probiotic , CMU.</a></h1><p>Recently, studies have explored the use of  like the  strain, CMU (oraCMU), for use as preventive dental medicine instead of chemical oral care methods. The present study was conducted to investigate the antibacterial properties of the cell-free supernatant (CFS) from this bacterium. Cell morphology using the scanning electron microscope, and the antibacterial effect of CFS under various growth conditions were evaluated. The production of hydrogen peroxide, organic acids, fatty acids, and secretory proteins was also studied. Most of the antibacterial effects of oraCMU against periodontal pathogens were found to be - and hydrogen peroxide-dose-dependent effects. Lactic , acetic , and citric  were the most common organic acids. Among the 37 fatty acids, only 0.02% of  (C18:1n-9, ) was detected.

In this study, L. obtusa was extracted and subjected to phenolic, sugar and flavonoid analyses.The fatty , vitamin and phytosterol contents in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were evaluated when it was incubated with L. obtusa dry biomass. The fatty acids in the lipid extract were analysed after converting them into methyl esters using gas chromatography, and vitamin concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). According to the achieved results, the total fatty  levels and vitamin contents of the S. cerevisiae prepared with algal extract increased at different rates. Our results showed that α-tocopherol decreased in the group in which the S. cerevisiae was added the algal extract. When compared to the control group, ergesterol increased in the group in which L. obtusa extract was added. Additionally, when compared to the control group in which L. obtusa extract was added, stearic  (18:0),  (18:1) and linoleic  (18:2) increased in the other groups. Palmitoleic  (16:1) increased in the L. obtusa culture medium, but palmitic  decreased in the L. obtusa culture medium. In conclusion, it was determined that the L. obtusa extract added to the development medium of S. cerevisiae caused differences in the synthesis of some vitamins and fatty acids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25465559>Probiotic administration modifies the milk fatty  profile, intestinal morphology, and intestinal fatty  profile of goats.</a></h1><p>The effect of a mixture of potentially probiotic bacteria (MPPB; Lactobacillus reuteri DDL 19, Lactobacillus alimentarius DDL 48, Enterococcus faecium DDE 39, and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains) on the milk fatty  (FA) profile, with emphasis on cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic  (CLA) in the middle stage of goat lactation, was determined. In addition, the effects of MPPB feeding on the FA profile in intestinal content and intestinal morphology in weaned goats were analyzed. The probiotic supplement was able to modify FA composition of milk and intestinal content. The unsaturated FA concentrations in milk (g of FA/L of milk) increased from 4.49 to 7.86 for  (18:1), from 0.70 to 1.39 for linoleic (18:2), from 0.063 to 0.187 for linolenic (18:3) , and from 0.093 to 0.232 for CLA. The atherogenicity index diminished 2-fold after MPPB ingestion. In the intestinal content of the weaned goats, no significant difference in saturated FA concentration compared with the control was observed. However, , linolenic , CLA, and docosahexaenoic  concentrations increased by 81, 23, 344, and 74%, respectively, after probiotic consumption. The ruminal production of CLA was increased by the MPPB. However, bacterial strains of MPPB were unable to produce CLA in culture media. By histological techniques, it was observed that the treated group had intestinally more conserved morphological structures than the control group. The results obtained in this study indicate that the MPPB administration in lactating and weaned goats allows for the production of milk with improved concentrations of beneficial compounds, and also produces a protective effect in the goat intestine. The results obtained in this study reinforce the strategy of  application to enhance goat health with the production of milk with higher concentrations of polyunsaturated FA.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

Gallstones can be pigmentary, cholesterol (75%) or mixed. Age, female sex, obesity, rapid weight loss, consumption of refined sugars, saturated fat, iron deficiency, vitamin D and low intake of fiber and vitamin C are factors associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis. On the other hand, the intake of ω-3 fatty acids, , calcium, magnesium, fiber, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, nuts, coffee, moderate consumption of alcohol, vitamin C supplements, physical exercise and a regular diet have a protective paper. The most frequent kidney stones are calcium oxalate followed by mixed ones (oxalate and calcium phosphate), struvite, uric  and cystine. A high water intake is recommended (> 2.5 l / day), varying the type of recommended or unadvisable food depending on the type of calculus. In oxalic lithiasis it is recommended to reduce the consumption of meat, moderate that of spinach, Swiss chard, asparagus, chocolate and avoid excessive sodium intake. The administration of oxalate-degrading  (Lactobacillus) may reduce intestinal absorption, although further studies are necessary to corroborate these results. In calcium phosphate acidifying diet is recommended and limit the consumption of coffee and tea. The prevention of uric calculus is based on hydration with alkalizing drinks and vegetarian diet, decreasing foods rich in purines (liver, kidney, fish eggs, anchovies, sardines and seafood) and in calculus of cystine diet is recommended alkalizing. Since the formation of struvite calculi is due to urinary infections, pharmacological treatment and the consumption of acidifying diets, moderation of the intake of phosphate-rich foods and limiting the contribution of fats and citrus fruits are necessary. The nutritional intervention is an effective measure in the prevention of biliary and renal lithiasis and prevent its recurrence.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28784489>Impact of multi-functional fermented goat milk beverage on gut microbiota in a dynamic colon model.</a></h1><p>The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of grape probiotic fermented beverages made of goat milk, with or without added grape pomace on gut microbiota in a Simulator of Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®). SHIME® model was used to investigate to assess changes in microbial composition and fermentation metabolites (short- and branched-chain fatty acids and ammonium), as well as under the antioxidant capacity. The results demonstrated that the beverages formulated, with or without grape pomace extract, exhibited high dietary fiber, , phenolic compounds content and antioxidant activity. Both beverages also kept L. rhamnosus and S. thermophilus viable during their passage through the intestinal tract and had a positive effect on gut microbiota metabolism, increasing the antioxidant capacity and the production of short-chain fatty acids, and decreasing the ammonium concentration. Therefore, the multifunctional beverages formulated in this study can offer a new perspective for the production of foods with positive potential effects on human health.Copyright © 2017.

We verified the effect of differences in culture conditions on  OLL2712 functionality; this strain exhibits anti-inflammatory activity and preventive effects against metabolic disorders. We measured interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-12 production in murine immune cells treated with OLL2712 cells prepared under various culture conditions. The results showed that the IL-10-inducing activities of OLL2712 cells on murine immune cells differed dramatically between OLL2712 groups at different culture phases and using different culture medium components, temperatures, and neutralizing pHs. In particular, exponential-phase cells had much more IL-10-inducing activity than stationary-phase cells. We confirmed that the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) stimulation activity of OLL2712 cells depended on culture conditions in conjunction with IL-10-inducing activity. We also demonstrated functional differences by culture phases ; OLL2712 cells at exponential phase had more anti-inflammatory activity and anti-metabolic-disorder effects on obese and diabetic mice than those by their stationary-phase counterparts. These results suggest that culture conditions affect the functionality of anti-inflammatory LAB. While previous studies demonstrated that culture conditions affected the immunomodulatory properties of lactic  bacteria (LAB), few have comprehensively investigated the relationship between culture conditions and LAB functionality. In this study, we demonstrated several culture conditions of  OLL2712 for higher anti-inflammatory activity. We also showed that culture conditions concretely influenced the health-promoting functions of OLL2712 , particularly against metabolic disorders. Further, we characterized a novel mechanism by which changing LAB culture conditions affected immunomodulatory properties. Our results suggest that culture condition optimization is important for the production of LAB with anti-inflammatory activity.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29064057>Antiaflatoxigenic Potential of Cell-Free Supernatant from Lactobacillus plantarum MYS44 Against Aspergillus parasiticus.</a></h1><p>The study aims to evaluate the cell-free supernatant (CFS) from Lactobacillus plantarum strain MYS44 against the growth and aflatoxin production by Aspergillus parasiticus MTCC 411. Standard in vitro techniques revealed the potential antifungal activity of CFS of LpMYS44. In poison food technique, it was observed that 6% CFS of LpMYS44 retarded maximum growth. The inhibition of A. parasiticus on peanuts confirmed the ability of CFS of LpMYS44 for biopreservation. Further, CFS of LpMYS44 was purified by chromatography and analyzed by GC-MS. The major antifungal compounds were , octanoic , butanamide, and decanoic  derivatives. Twofold concentrated 80 μL of CFS was found to be minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of CFS of LpMYS44. CFS of LpMYS44 suppressed the germination and growth of the spores of A. parasiticus. Microscopic observation showed that CFS of LpMYS44 severely affected the hyphal wall of A. parasiticus by the leakage of cytoplasmic content leading to complete destruction. Acidic condition is favorable for CFS of LpMYS44 activity. In poultry feed sample, CFS of LpMYS44 reduced the aflatoxin B content by 34.2%, reflecting its potentiality to use as detoxification agent. The multiple antifungal components in CFS of LpMYS44 exhibited antifungal properties against aflatoxigenic A. parasiticus resulted in causing overall morphological changes. Furthermore, we also observed the biopreservative ability of CFS of LpMYS44 against A. parasiticus and AFB reduction in for poultry feed.

Six strains of Lactobacillus plantarum and one strain of Lactobacillus paracasei were selected and identified. In the co-cultivation assay, L. plantarum subsp. plantarum I62 showed the strongest and broadest antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella Paratyphi A, and Salmonella Typhimurium SA 2093 under the mimicked proximal colon condition, in which glucose and other nutrients were limited. According to GC-MS analysis, the major antibacterial contribution of organic acids secreted by L. plantarum I62 grown in the presence of glucose was dramatically reduced from 95.8 to 41.9 % under glucose-limited niche. The production of low-pK a acids, such as lactic, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic, and 3-phenyllactic acids, was remarkably dropped. Surprisingly, higher-pK a acids such as 5-chlorobenzimidazole-2-carboxylic, pyroglutamic, palmitic, and  acids were enhanced. Moreover, cyclic dipeptides, ketones, alkanes, alcohols, and miscellaneous compounds, which were pH-independent antibacterial metabolites, became dominant.

In the present study, we analyzed the modulation of the gut microbiota in mice infected with the helminth Strongyloides venezuelensis, and fed either a standard rodent chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD). To investigate the effects of the microbiota modulation on the metabolism, we analyzed the expression of tight-junction proteins present in the gut epithelium, inflammatory markers in the serum and tissue and quantified glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and resistance. Additionally, the levels of lipids related to inflammation were evaluated in the feces and serum. Our results show that infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis results in a modification of the gut microbiota, most notably by increasing Lactobacillus spp. These modifications in the microbiota alter the host metabolism by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, switching macrophages from a M1 to M2 pattern in the adipose tissue, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins in the intestinal cells (thereby reducing the permeability) and decreasing LPS in the serum. Taken together, these changes correlate with improved insulin signaling and sensitivity, which could also be achieved with HFD mice treated with . Additionally, helminth infected mice produce higher levels of , which participates in anti-inflammatory pathways. These results suggest that modulation of the microbiota by helminth infection or probiotic treatment causes a reduction in subclinical inflammation, which has a positive effect on the glucose metabolism of the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
