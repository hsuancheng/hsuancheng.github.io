The disease is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and behavioral difficulties and motor function retardation.In this study, targeted exome sequencing was used in consanguineous parent (mother) of a deceased child with clinical diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis. Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm the candidate pathogenic variants in extended family members and segregation analysis. In silico pathogenicity assessment of detected variant using multiple computational predictive tools were performed. Computational docking using the Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD) 6.0.1 software applied to evaluate affinity binding of altered protein for its ligand, N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine. Moreover, with I-TASSER software functional alterations between wild and mutant proteins evaluated.We identiﬁed a novel heterozygote deletion variant (c.1294-1304 del CTCTTCCCCAA, p.432LeufsX25) in the  gene. The variant was classified as pathogenic based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guideline. Computational docking with the Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD) 6.0.1 software confirmed different affinity binding of truncated protein for its ligand. Moreover, I-TASSER software revealed structural and functional alterations of mutant proteins.This study expands the spectrum of  pathogenic variants and confirms the utility of targeted NGS sequencing in genetic diagnosis and also the utility and power of additional family information.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657254>[Musculoskeletal relevance of obesity: a new approach to an old topic].</a></h2><p>Authors discuss the musculoskeletal aspects of obesity by applying a novel approach.

This mismatch results in an excess of fat storage in ectopic depots, notably in the liver and viscera (= hepato-visceral, or central fat). There is still no FDA-approved treatment for adolescent PCOS. The prime aim should be a preferential loss of central fat, through lifestyle measures. Failure to sustain these measures is frequent, and the standard approach is to add an estroprogestagen contraceptive, even for girls who do not need contraception. Treatment with SPIOMET, a low-dose combination of spironolactone (to antagonize androgen and mineralocorticoid effects, and to activate BAT thereby raising energy expenditure), pioglitazone (to raise circulating HMW adiponectin concentrations) and metformin, is an alternative approach that holds the potential to revert the PCOS phenotype.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642088>A nurse-led lifestyle intervention using mobile application versus booklet for adults with - Protocol for a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>To compare the effect of a lifestyle intervention programme using mobile application versus booklet for adults with  living in the community.A multi-site randomized controlled trial with three parallel arms, namely,  app group, booklet group and control group.The research study has been supported by the Health and Medical Research fund in Hong Kong in 2019.

To date, the clinical impact of elevated serum homocysteine (Hcy) levels in MetS is still under discussion. The aim of this cross sectional study was to evaluate the relationship between MetS and hyperhomocysteinemia and the potential role of Hcy in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic complications of MetS.We recruited 300 outpatients with MetS. All patients underwent a medical history collection, physical examination, blood sampling and carotid ultrasound echo-color Doppler. According to Hcy levels, MetS patients were divided into two groups: "normal" (< 10.7 μmol/l; n = 140, group 1) and "high" Hcy (≥ 10.7 μmol/l; n = 160, group 2). Comparisons between groups were made by Student's t-test or Chi-square test. The effects of potential covariates on group differences were evaluated by general linear models. The relationships between continuous variables were assessed by simple or multiple correlation and by linear regression. Multiple regression models were built to evaluate the effects of Hcy, together with other potential risk factors, on carotid atherosclerosis.Patients with high Hcy were predominantly male and slightly older than group 1 patients. Smokers and non-smokers exhibited similar Hcy levels, nor was a statistical relationship between pack-years and Hcy observed. Group 2 showed lower levels of folic acid, vitamin D, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR) than group 1, but higher levels of C-peptide, uric acid and triglycerides. In all patients, Hcy was positively correlated with C-peptide and uric acid and negatively with folic acid and e-GFR. Intima-media thickness (IMT) and carotid stenosis degree were significantly higher in patients with high Hcy and a positive relationship between Hcy and both IMT and carotid stenosis was detected in all patients. Finally, Hcy atherogenic effects were independent of other well-known atherosclerosis risk factors.Our results highlight a link between MetS and hyperhomocysteinemia and a direct effect of Hcy on atherogenic process during MetS. Early correction of folic acid levels may contribute to prevent cardiovascular complications in MetS patients.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643142>Physical health assistance in early recovery of psychosis: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Young people with psychotic disorders have poorer physical health compared to their healthy peers, a state compounded by the  side-effects of antipsychotic medications.

This study was performed to test the hypotheses that Paso Fino horses exhibit evidence of insulin dysregulation compared with Thoroughbred horses and that obesity exaggerates the insulin dysregulation. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed in 14 moderate-weight Thoroughbreds, 12 moderate-weight Paso Finos, and 12 overweight Paso Finos. Moderate Paso Finos had greater baseline serum insulin concentrations, area under the insulin concentration curve, peak insulin, insulin-to-glucose ratio, area under the insulin to glucose curve, and modified glucose-to-insulin ratio compared with moderate Thoroughbreds. The reciprocal inverse square of basal insulin (RISQI) and glucose-to-insulin ratio were significantly lower in moderate Paso Finos compared with moderate Thoroughbreds. Overweight Paso Finos had greater baseline insulin concentrations, area under the insulin concentration curve, time to peak insulin, baseline plasma glucose concentration, insulin-to-glucose ratio, and area under the insulin to glucose curve compared with moderate Paso Finos. The RISQI and glucose-to-insulin ratio were significantly lower in overweight Paso Finos compared with moderate Paso Finos. In conclusion, moderate-weight Paso Finos had higher baseline serum insulin concentrations and an excessive hyperinsulinemic response to an intravenous glucose load when compared with moderate-weight Thoroughbreds. Overweight Paso Finos had even greater baseline insulin concentrations and hyperinsulinemic responses to glucose compared with moderate Paso Finos, as well as greater baseline plasma glucose concentrations.

Accumulating damage of cellular components can trigger various diseases, including  and cancer. Over the past few years, the physiological significance of microRNAs (miRNA) in cancer has been a focus of comprehensive research. In view of the extensive level of miRNA interference in biological processes, the roles of miRNAs in oxidative stress and their relevance in physiological processes have recently become a subject of interest. In-depth research is underway to specifically address the direct or indirect relationships of oxidative stress-induced miRNAs in liver cancer and the potential involvement of the thyroid hormone in these processes. While studies on thyroid hormone in liver cancer are abundantly documented, no conclusive information on the potential relationships among thyroid hormone, specific miRNAs, and oxidative stress in liver cancer is available. In this review, we discuss the effects of thyroid hormone on oxidative stress-related miRNAs that potentially have a positive or negative impact on liver cancer.

Also, the response to clomiphene citrate was studied as presence or absence of ovulation.The prevalence of phenotypes A, B, C, and D were 67.7%, 11%, 17.7%, and 3.6%, respectively. Phenotype A had significantly higher weight, body mass index, clinical, and biochemical hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities, ovarian reserve parameters, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and more deranged lipid profile ( < 0.05). Clomiphene resistance was significantly more common in phenotype A ( < 0.05). No significant differences were noted in the waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure and blood sugar values (fasting, 1-hour postprandial, 2-hour postprandial). Also, the Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), LH-FSH ratio, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and vitamin D levels were not significantly different among various PCOS phenotypes.Full-blown PCOS (phenotype A) is at a higher risk of adverse  and cardiovascular outcomes as compared with the others, and phenotype D is the least severe phenotype.

SIRT1 is a  sensor of cellular energy and exerts essential functions on energy metabolism, oxidative stress response, apoptosis, or aging. Importantly, SIRT1 deacetylates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), the master regulator of energy metabolism involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid utilization. However, the exact role of SIRT1 in controlling cardiac energy metabolism is still incompletely understood and conflicting results have been obtained. We generated a cardio-specific inducible model of Sirt1 gene deletion in mice () to decipher the role of SIRT1 in control conditions and following cardiac stress induced by pressure overload. SIRT1 deficiency induced a progressive cardiac dysfunction, without overt alteration in mitochondrial content or properties. Sixteen weeks after  deletion an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a higher rate of oxidative damage were observed, suggesting disruption of the ROS production/detoxification balance. Following pressure overload, cardiac dysfunction and alteration in mitochondrial properties were exacerbated in  mice.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a correlation with  and its complications.We reviewed the literature regarding the mechanisms of developing NAFLD through AGE-RAGE signaling.NAFLD, , and production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) share many common risk factors and appear to be connected. AGE induces production of the receptor for AGE (RAGE). AGE-RAGE interaction contributes to fat accumulation in the liver leading to inflammation, fibrosis, insulin resistance, and other complications of the fatty liver disease. The immune system, especially macrophages, has an important defense mechanism against RAGE pathway activities.Soluble form of RAGE (sRAGE) has the capability to reduce inflammation by blocking the interaction of AGE with RAGE. However, sRAGE has some limitations, and the best method of usage is probably autotransplantation of transfected stem cells or monocytes, as a precursor of macrophages and Kupffer cells, with a virus that carries sRAGE to alleviate the harmful effects of AGE-RAGE signaling in the settings of fatty liver disease.Copyright © 2019 Kamyar Asadipooya et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669422>Differential  and multi-tissue transcriptomic responses to fructose consumption among genetically diverse mice.</a></h2><p>Understanding how individuals react differently to the same treatment is a major concern in precision medicine.  challenges such as the one posed by high fructose intake are important determinants of disease mechanisms. We embarked on studies to determine how fructose affects differential  dysfunctions across genetically dissimilar mice, namely, C57BL/6 J (B6), DBA/2 J (DBA) and FVB/NJ (FVB), by integrating physiological and gene regulatory mechanisms. We report that fructose has strain-specific effects, involving tissue-specific gene regulatory cascades in hypothalamus, liver, and white adipose tissues. DBA mice showed the largest numbers of genes associated with adiposity, congruent with their highest susceptibility to adiposity gain and glucose intolerance across the three tissues. In contrast, B6 and FVB mainly exhibited cholesterol phenotypes, accompanying the largest number of adipose genes correlating with total cholesterol in B6, and liver genes correlating with LDL in FVB mice. Tissue-specific network modeling predicted strain-and tissue-specific regulators such as Fgf21 (DBA) and Lss (B6), which were subsequently validated in primary hepatocytes. Strain-specific fructose-responsive genes revealed susceptibility for human diseases such that genes in liver and adipose tissue in DBA showed strong enrichment for human type 2 diabetes and obesity traits. Liver and adipose genes in FVB were mostly related to lipid traits, and liver and adipose genes in B6 showed relevance to most cardiometabolic traits tested. Our results show that fructose induces gene regulatory pathways that are tissue specific and dependent on the genetic make-up, which may underlie interindividual variability in cardiometabolic responses to high fructose consumption.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We did a random-effects meta-analysis for groups of effect estimates where case ascertainment methods, age groups, and confounders were similar, presenting pooled estimates with 95% CIs and prediction intervals.Of the 3318 identified studies, 39 met the inclusion criteria, examining 42 clinical conditions between them. The adjusted risk of death due to any cause was higher in people with HTLV-1 when compared with HTLV-1-negative counterparts (RR 1·57, 95% CI 1·37-1·80). From meta-analysis, HTLV-1 was associated with increased odds of seborrheic dermatitis (OR 3·95, 95% CI 1·99-7·81), Sjogren's  (3·25, 1·85-5·70), and, inversely, with lower relative risk of gastric cancer (RR 0·45, 0·28-0·71). There were a further 14 diseases with significant associations or substantially elevated risk with HTLV-1 from single studies (eczema [children]; bronchiectasis, bronchitis and bronchiolitis [analysed together]; asthma [males]; fibromyalgia; rheumatoid arthritis; arthritis; tuberculosis; kidney and bladder infections; dermatophytosis; community acquired pneumonia; strongyloides hyperinfection ; liver cancer; lymphoma other than adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma; and cervical cancer).There is a broad range of diseases studied in association with HTLV-1. However, the elevated risk for death among people with HTLV-1 is not explained by available studies of morbidity. Many of the diseases shown to be associated with HTLV-1 are not fatal, and those that are (eg, leukaemia) occur too rarely to account for the observed mortality effect. There are substantial research gaps in relation to HTLV-1 and cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and  disease. The burden of disease associated with the virus might be broader than generally recognised.Commonwealth Department of Health, Australia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although whole-body glucose clearance is normal, one-month-old lambs with IUGR at birth have higher rates of hindlimb glucose uptake, which may compensate for myocyte deficiencies in glucose oxidation. Impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in IUGR lambs is due to lower intra-islet insulin availability and not from glucose sensing. We investigated adrenergic receptor (ADR) β2 desensitization by administering oral ADRβ modifiers for the first month after birth to activate ADRβ2 and antagonize ADRβ1/3. In IUGR lambs ADRβ2 activation increased whole-body glucose utilization rates and insulin sensitivity but had no effect on isolated islet or myocyte deficiencies. IUGR establishes risk for developing diabetes. In IUGR lambs we identified disparities in key aspects of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation, providing new insights into potential mechanisms for this risk.Placental insufficiency causes intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and disturbances in glucose homeostasis with associated β-adrenergic receptor (ADRβ) desensitization. Our objectives were to measure insulin-sensitive glucose metabolism in neonatal lambs with IUGR and to determine whether daily treatment with ADRβ2 agonist and ADRβ1/β3 antagonists for one month normalizes their glucose metabolism. Growth, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), and glucose utilization rates (GUR) were measured in control lambs, IUGR lambs, and IUGR lambs treated with β2-agonist clenbuterol, β1-antagonist atenolol, and β3-antagonist SR59230A (IUGR-AR). In IUGR lambs, islet insulin content and GSIS were less than in controls; however, insulin sensitivity and whole-body GUR were not different from controls. Of importance, ADRβ2 stimulation with β1/β3 inhibition increases both insulin sensitivity and whole-body glucose utilization in IUGR lambs. In IUGR and IUGR-AR lambs, hindlimb GUR were greater but fractional glucose oxidation rates and ex vivo skeletal muscle glucose oxidation rates were lower than controls. Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) was lower in IUGR and IUGR-AR skeletal muscle than in controls but GLUT1 was greater in IUGR-AR. ADRβ2, insulin receptor, glycogen content, and citrate synthase activity were similar among groups. In IUGR and IUGR-AR lambs heart rates were greater, which was independent of cardiac ADRβ1 activation. We conclude that targeted ADRβ2 stimulation improved whole-body insulin sensitivity but minimally affected defects in GSIS and skeletal muscle glucose oxidation. We show that risk factors for developing diabetes are independent of postnatal catch-up growth in IUGR lambs as early as one-month of age and are inherent to the islets and myocytes.

N = 412 patients underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) to assess the presence and characteristics of coronary atherosclerosis. A CTA score, combining extent, severity, composition, and location of plaques was computed.Patients were divided according to PCSK9 quartiles: I (< 136 ng/mL), II-III (136-266 ng/mL), and IV quartile (> 266 ng/mL). Compared with patients in quartile IV, patients in quartile I had a higher prevalence of the  and higher values of body mass index. LDL- and HDL-cholesterol were significantly lower in patients in the quartile I than in those in quartile IV. Coronary CTA documented normal vessels in 30% and obstructive CAD in 35% of cases without differences among PCSK9 quartiles. Compared with patients with the highest levels, patients with the lowest PCSK9 levels had a higher CTA score mainly due to higher number of mixed non-obstructive coronary plaques. At multivariable analysis including clinical, medications, and lipid variables, PCSK9 was an independent predictor of the CTA score (coefficient - 0.129, SE 0.03, P < 0.0001), together with age, male gender, statins, interleukin-6, and leptin.In patients with stable CAD, low PCSK9 plasma levels are associated with a particular  phenotype (low HDL cholesterol, the , obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes) and diffuse non-obstructive coronary atherosclerosis.

We postulated that Chinese women with PCOS would have higher risk of incident diabetes and cardiometabolic abnormalities than those without PCOS during long-term follow-up.One hundred ninety-nine Chinese women with PCOS diagnosed by the Rotterdam criteria and with a mean age of 41.2 years (SD = 6.4) completed a follow-up evaluation after an average of 10.6 ± 1.3 years. Two hundred twenty-five women without PCOS (mean age: 54.1 ± 6.7 years) who underwent baseline and follow-up evaluation over the same period were used for comparison. Progression of glycaemic status of women both with and without PCOS was assessed by using 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) screening with the adoption of 2009 American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria. The frequency of impaired glucose regulation, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia of women with PCOS at follow-up has increased from 31.7% (95% CI 25.2%-38.1%) to 47.2% (95% CI 40.3%-54.2%), 16.1% (95% CI 11.0%-21.2%) to 34.7% (95% CI 28.1%-41.3%), and 52.3% (95% CI 45.3%-59.2%) to 64.3% (95% CI 57.7%-71.0%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in follow-up women with PCOS is 26.1% (95% CI 20.0%-32.2%), almost double that in the cohort of women without PCOS (p < 0.001). Age-standardised incidence of diabetes among women with PCOS was 22.12 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 10.86-33.37) compared with the local female population incidence rate of 8.76 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 8.72-8.80) and 10.09 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 4.92-15.26, p < 0.001) for women without PCOS in our study. Incidence rate for women with PCOS aged 30-39 years was 20.56 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 12.57-31.87), which is approximately 10-fold higher than that of the age-matched general female population in Hong Kong (1.88 per 1,000 person-years, [95% CI 1.85-1.92]). The incidence rate of type 2 DM (T2DM) of both normal-weight and overweight women with PCOS was around double that of corresponding control groups (normal weight: 8.96 [95% CI 3.92-17.72] versus 4.86 per 1,000 person-years [95% CI 2.13-9.62], p > 0.05; overweight/obese: 28.64 [95% CI 19.55-40.60] versus 14.1 per 1,000 person-years [95% CI 8.20-22.76], p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis identified that baseline waist-to-hip ratio (odds ratio [OR] = 1.71 [95% CI 1.08-2.69], p < 0.05) and elevated triglyceride (OR = 6.63 [95% CI 1.23-35.69], p < 0.05) are associated with the progression to T2DM in PCOS. Limitations of this study include moderate sample size with limited number of incident diabetes during follow-up period and potential selection bias.High risk of diabetes and increased cardiovascular disease risk factors among Chinese women with PCOS are highlighted in this long-term follow-up study. Diabetes onset was, on average, 10 years earlier among women with PCOS than in women without PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682536>Barriers to Weight Loss and Physical Activity, and Coach Approaches to Addressing Barriers, in a Real-World Adaptation of the DPP Lifestyle Intervention: A Process Analysis.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study is to identify barriers to weight loss and physical activity, as well as approaches used by coaches, in a real-world, community sample of adults with  (at risk for type 2 diabetes) who participated in a Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)-adapted weight loss intervention and compare findings to data from the screened and highly selected DPP sample.SHINE (Support, Health Information, Nutrition, and Exercise) was a telephonic DPP adaptation. Primary care staff delivered the DPP curriculum, and lifestyle coaches provided monthly direction to achieve weight loss. For this substudy, barriers to weight loss and physical activity described by participants, as well as approaches coaches used to address them, were gathered. Groupings of barriers (DPP defined) were analyzed in relation to demographic characteristics and compared to data from the DPP sample.Top weight loss barriers were problems with self-monitoring, too little physical activity, internal thought/mood cues, vacation/holidays, and social cues. Percentages reporting a barrier were much higher in SHINE. Top physical activity barriers were problems with self-monitoring, access/weather, time management, aches/pains, and vacation/holidays. These did not correspond closely to DPP data. Coaches used problem solving, self-monitoring skills review, increased physical activity, and motivational strategies. SHINE coaches were more likely than DPP coaches to use alternative approaches.Barriers to weight loss and physical activity in a community sample of persons at risk for diabetes occurred at much higher rates than in the highly screened DPP sample. Training coaches in a variety of patient-centered approaches may maximize their positive impact.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679020> and related risk factors among adults in the northern West Bank, a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p> (MetS) is a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors that includes central obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and hypertension. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of MetS and its associated risk factors among adult Palestinians using the International Diabetes Federation definition.A total of 1348 subjects ages 18-65 y were recruited in a cross-sectional study that was conducted in 2018-2019 in the northern West Bank.A total of 1082 subjects participated; 51.7% were men. The prevalence of MetS was high (44.9%), and higher among women (46.1%) than men (44.2%) (p<0.001). The prevalence increased significantly with increasing age and body mass index (BMI) in both genders (p<0.001). However, metabolically obese but normal weight individuals (MONW) (8.4%) were also identified, with a slight increase among women (9.4%) compared with men (7.5%) (p=0.56). MetS was more likely to be prevalent among participants with increased fasting blood sugar (5.8 times), increased triglyceride (7.4 times), increased blood pressure (4.5 times) and BMI ≥25 (19.9 times) (p<0.001). The prevalence of MetS was higher among rural (50.3%) vs urban (39.3%) residents and refugees (33.8%).With increasing age and obesity, clustering of MetS components increased remarkably in both genders. Effective prevention and treatment strategies for MetS and its risk factors should be developed targeting different ages and genders.© The Author(s) 2019.

Moreover, central characteristics of the MetS like inflammation, obesity and insulin resistance have been associated with the frailty . However, the relationship between MetS and frailty has not yet been studied in detail. Aim of the current analysis within the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) was to explore associations between MetS and frailty taking important co-variables such as nutrition (total energy intake, dietary vitamin D intake), physical activity and vitamin D-status into account.Complete cross-sectional data of 1,486 old participants (50.2% women, 68.7 (65.8-71.3) years) of BASE-II were analyzed. MetS was defined following the joint interim statement of the International Diabetes Federation Task Force on Epidemiology and Prevention; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; American Heart Association; World Heart Federation; International Atherosclerosis Society; and International Association for the Study of Obesity in 2009. Frailty was defined according to the Fried criteria. Limitations in physical performance were assessed via questionnaire, muscle mass was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and grip strength using a Smedley dynamometer. Adjusted regression models were calculated to assess the association between MetS and Frailty.MetS was prevalent in 37.6% of the study population and 31.9% were frail or prefrail according to the here calculated frailty index. In adjusted models the odds of being frail/prefrail were increased about 50% with presence of the MetS (OR1.5; 95% CI 1.2,1.9; p= 0.002). Moreover the odds of being prefrail/frail were significantly increased with low HDL-C (OR: 1.5 (95%CI: 1.0-2.3); p = 0.037); and elevated waist circumference (OR: 1.65 (95%CI: 1.1-2.3); p = 0.008).The current analysis supports an association between MetS and frailty. There are various , immune and endocrine alterations in MetS that also play a role in mechanisms underlying the frailty . To what extent cytokine alterations, inflammatory processes, vitamin D supply and hormonal changes in age and in special  states as MetS influence the development of frailty should be subject of further research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667949>The potential application of Cordyceps in -related disorders.</a></h2><p>Changes in the global economy resulted in sedentary lifestyle and excessive calorie intake, increasing the incidence of  diseases, which subsequently became a universal public concern.

This study aimed to identify pathogenic mutations in a consanguineous Iranian family with AS. Next-generation sequencing was performed on the genomic DNA obtained from a 12 years old girl with AS. According to the bioinformatics analysis, computational modelling and segregation of variants, we identified two homozygous mutations close together in exon 8 of ALMS1 in the patient, including c.7262 G>T and c.7303-7305delAG. The clinically normal parents were heterozygous for both mutations. These mutations have a very rare frequency and only reported in the heterozygous state in the public genomic databases. Overall, due to the large size of the ALMS1 gene and clinical similarity with other ciliopathies and genetic disorders, whole exome sequencing can be useful for the identification of pathogenic mutations and the improvement of AS clinical management.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To identify common variants in SNAP25 associated with schizophrenia and evaluate their effects on AIWG and antipsychotic responses in Han Chinese individuals with schizophrenia, we conducted a two-stage case-control study of 3,243 patients and 6,154 healthy controls. 2128 inpatients in the replication stage have received conventional treatment with an antipsychotic monotherapy (Haloperidol, Olanzapine or Risperidone) for 10 weeks at least. Weight change, antipsychotic responses and  indices change were assessed during treatments. Three SNPs were significantly associated with schizophrenia in samples (rs6039769, P = 6.64 × 10; rs3787283, P = 0.004283; rs3746544, P = 2.51 × 10). Of these, rs6039769 is a novel schizophrenia-associated SNP and is uncorrelated with the other two variants, which have previously been associated with schizophrenia in European-ancestry samples. Rs6039769 was significantly associated with AIWG (P < 0.001), but not with antipsychotic responses or  indices. Another two SNPs were not associated with AIWG or antipsychotic responses or  indices. Overall, there were significant differences in antipsychotic responses and  indices among the three treatment groups. Our findings suggest that SNAP25 gene may contribute to the susceptibility of AIWG and even  disturbances. A prior identification of high-risk of patients with rs6039769 would contribute to a better precision of the pharmacological treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The P2Y inhibitor was initially used for its platelet anti-aggregatory action to block thrombosis of the recanalized coronary artery or deployed stent. It is now recognized that these agents also offer potent cardioprotection against a reperfusion injury that occurs in the first minutes of reperfusion if platelet aggregation is blocked at the time of reperfusion. But this is difficult to achieve with oral agents which are slowly absorbed and often require time-consuming  activation. Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction who usually have a large mass of myocardium at risk of infarction seldom have sufficient time for upstream-administered oral agents to achieve a therapeutic P2Y level of inhibition by the time of balloon inflation. However, optimal treatment could be assured by initiating an IV cangrelor infusion shortly prior to stenting followed by subsequent post-PCI transition to an oral agent, that is, ticagrelor, once success of the recanalization and absence of need for surgical intervention are confirmed. Not only should this sequence provide optimal protection against infarction, it should also negate bleeding if coronary artery bypass grafting should be required since stopping the cangrelor infusion at any time will quickly restore platelet reactivity. It is anticipated that cangrelor-induced myocardial salvage will help preserve myocardial function and significantly diminish postinfarction heart failure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647051>Self-reported sleep disturbances are associated with poorer cognitive performance in older adults with hypertension: a multi-parameter risk factor investigation.</a></h2><p>Given the evidence of multi-parameter risk factors in shaping cognitive outcomes in aging, including sleep, inflammation, cardiometabolism, and mood disorders, multidimensional investigations of their impact on cognition are warranted. We sought to determine the extent to which self-reported sleep disturbances,  (MetS) factors, cellular inflammation, depressive symptomatology, and diminished physical mobility were associated with cognitive impairment and poorer cognitive performance.This is a cross-sectional study.Participants with elevated, well-controlled blood pressure were recruited from the local community for a Tai Chi and healthy-aging intervention study.One hundred forty-five older adults (72.7 ± 7.9 years old; 66% female), 54 (37%) with evidence of cognitive impairment (CI) based on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score ≤24, underwent medical, psychological, and mood assessments.CI and cognitive domain performance were assessed using the MoCA. Univariate correlations were computed to determine relationships between risk factors and cognitive outcomes. Bootstrapped logistic regression was used to determine significant predictors of CI risk and linear regression to explore cognitive domains affected by risk factors.The CI group were slower on the mobility task, satisfied more MetS criteria, and reported poorer sleep than normocognitive individuals (all p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that sleep disturbances, but no other risk factors, predicted increased risk of evidence of CI (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.26-4.87, 99% CI: 1.08-7.48). Further examination of MoCA cognitive subdomains revealed that sleep disturbances predicted poorer executive function (β = -0.26, 95% CI: -0.51 to -0.06, 99% CI: -0.61 to -0.02), with lesser effects on visuospatial performance (β = -0.20, 95% CI: -0.35 to -0.02, 99% CI: -0.39 to 0.03), and memory (β = -0.29, 95% CI: -0.66 to -0.01, 99% CI: -0.76 to 0.08).Our results indicate that the deleterious impact of self-reported sleep disturbances on cognitive performance was prominent over other risk factors and illustrate the importance of clinician evaluation of sleep in patients with or at risk of diminished cognitive performance.

The underlying condition appears to be an increase in total body uric acid stores and is usually marked by hyperuricemia. Hyperuricemia is typically defined as serum uric acid levels greater than 7.0 mg/dL. Gout is more common in men than women and usually has its onset in 4th or 5th decade of life. Approximately 1% of adult Americans report having gout and 5% have some degree of hyperuricemia. Management of gout can be directed at treatment of acute attacks of gouty arthritis or to long term maintenance therapy directed at preventing attacks or decreasing the risk of uric acid nephropathy or nephrolithiasis. Treatment of acute attacks usually rests on use of nonsteroid antiinflammatory agents such as indomethacin, naproxen, sulindac or celecoxib. Colchicine (1961: Colbenemid and others) is used both during acute episodes and in chronic maintenance therapy. However, the major approach to long term prevention of gout and the complications of uric acid nephropathy is the use of uricosuric acids such as probenecid (1951: Benuryl) and benzbromarone (not available in the United States) and/or inhibitors of xanthine oxidase, such as the xanthine derivative allopurinol (1966: Aloprim) and the newer nonnucleoside xanthine oxidase inhibitors such as febuxostat (2009: Uloric, Adenuric). Newer approaches to gout include use of lesinurad (Zurampic: 2015), a drug that inhibits the reabsorption of uric acid in the distal tubules of the kidney, and use of recombinant enzymes that metabolize uric acid such as pegloticase (Kystexxa), which is used in combination with xanthine oxidase inhibitors ito treat severe gout, and rasburicase (Elitek: 2002) which is used to treat the hyperuricemia associated with tumor lysis  induced by cancer chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679154>Cystic Fibrosis Diagnosis in Newborns, Children, and Adults.</a></h2><p>The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) has traditionally relied on the presence of clinical features of the disease. Today, diagnosis through newborn screening (NBS) is becoming the standard of modern CF care. CF NBS programs can identify CF prior to clinical presentation, but for the advantages of an early diagnosis to accrue a scrupulous system must be in place to ensure all steps in the program are performing. As we move rapidly into the era of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein modulators, the opportunity to start a presymptomatic infant, identified through CF NBS, on these agents offers the prospect of true disease-modifying interventions which could result in a paradigm shift in CF care.Conversely, the introduction of NBS has resulted in many children being asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Some screened newborns are classified as "CF Screening Positive, Inconclusive Diagnosis", or "CFTR-related " when the diagnosis can neither be confirmed nor excluded. Appropriate assessment and follow-up should be arranged at specialist centers as a proportion of these infants and adults will eventually be diagnosed with CF.Symptoms and signs are particularly pertinent when considering a diagnosis of CF outside the context of NBS. In older patients with a late diagnosis, the spectrum of clinical presentation can be very variable with vigilant clinicians from multiple specialties suspecting the diagnosis in conditions such as recurrent pulmonary infections, male infertility, pancreatitis, nasal polyposis, and malabsorption.In addition to clinical symptoms or positive NBS results, sweat test and genetic analysis are cornerstones in the diagnosis of CF, but in some cases the diagnosis cannot be confirmed on genetic or sweat testing. Difficult diagnosis may be supported by  or  electrophysiology measurements on respiratory or intestinal epithelia. This can be done by either measuring transepithelial nasal potential difference or intestinal current measurements.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663108>Effects of Sargaquinoic Acid in Sargassum Serratifolium on Inducing Brown Adipocyte-like Phenotype in Mouse Adipocytes In Vitro.</a></h2><p>A previous study showed that the meroterpenoid-rich fraction of an ethanolic extract of  (MES) stimulated adipose tissue browning and inhibited diet-induced obesity and . Sargaquinoic acid (SQA) is a major component in MES. We investigated the effects of SQA on the differentiation of preadipocytes to the beige adipocytes. SQA was treated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated under a special condition that has been reported to induce the browning of adipocytes. SQA at 10 µM reduced lipid accumulation by approximately 23%. SQA at 2.5 - 10 µM induced the differentiation of white adipocytes to beige adipocytes partially by increasing the mitochondrial density and the expression of beige/brown adipocyte markers. In addition, SQA activated lipid catabolic pathways, evidenced by the increased expression levels of perilipin, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1.

This shift poses an insidious health risk for the development of  (MetS). Early detection is needed because in the South Asian population, this  carries an increased risk of comorbidities compared to people without the . This study was designed to elucidate the prevalence of MetS and its risk factors in young people in urban areas of Pakistan.  A cross-sectional study was conducted in four undergraduate institutions in Lahore, Pakistan. Five hundred and nine young people participated, and each provided their informed consent for the collection of data on their demographic, physical, and biochemical characteristics along with information on their dietary, sleep, and physical activity habits.  Most participants reported consuming greater-than-recommended amounts of protein and smaller-than-recommended amounts of vegetables and fruits. The International Diabetes Federation criteria for MetS were fulfilled by 6.1% of the students. Hypertension (67.7%) and hypo-HDL-emia (64.5%) were the most common risk factors. More than 50% of the respondents slept fewer hours per day than recommended, and 33% had a sedentary lifestyle. Men, participants with a family history of  illness and those with low physical activity levels had higher odds of a positive result on screening for MetS.  The early detection of MetS and early identification of probable risk factors may make beneficial contributions to both public health and clinical interventions directed at high-risk individuals. Establishing and using cutoff values for modified waist circumference and specific body mass index in Asian populations may aid in early detection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650717>Association between Diabetes and the Use of Removable Dental Prostheses among the Korean Population.</a></h2><p>A balanced nutrient intake is important for patients with diabetes. Even if individuals have the same number of residual natural teeth, there are large differences in the masticatory performance between edentulous sites restored with a fixed dental prosthesis, including dental implants, and those restored with a removable dental prosthesis. This study assessed whether the prevalence and control of diabetes differed based on the use of removable dental prostheses through an analysis of nationally representative data.Overall, 8,155 individuals (3,525 men and 4,630 women) aged ≥ 50 years were included in this study and were classified into the following 3 groups: group 1, did not use any removable dental prostheses (NF); group 2, used removable partial dentures (RPD); and group 3, used removable complete dentures on at least 1 jaw (CD). The characterization of diabetic patients and glycemic control were analyzed and compared among groups. To determine the relationship between diabetes and the use of dental prostheses, multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed ( < 0.05).The adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for diabetes in men participants in groups NF, RPD, and CD were 1 (reference), 1.165 (0.878-1.544), and 1.491 (1.034-2.151), respectively, after adjusting for confounding factors. Diabetes and glycemic control were significantly associated with the use of removable dental prostheses among men.The use of removable dental prostheses is a potential risk indicator for uncontrolled diabetes in Korean men adults, suggesting the need for a comprehensive approach to minimize the complications of diabetes mellitus.© 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676673>Folliculin Interacting Protein 1 Maintains  Homeostasis during B Cell Development by Modulating AMPK, mTORC1, and TFE3.</a></h2><p>Folliculin interacting protein 1 (Fnip1) is a cytoplasmic protein originally discovered through its interaction with the master  sensor 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Folliculin, a protein mutated in individuals with Birt-Hogg-Dubé . In response to low energy, AMPK stimulates catabolic pathways such as autophagy to enhance energy production while inhibiting anabolic pathways regulated by the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). We previously found that constitutive disruption of  in mice resulted in a lack of peripheral B cells because of a block in B cell development at the pre-B cell stage. Both AMPK and mTORC1 were activated in -deficient B cell progenitors. In this study, we found inappropriate mTOR localization at the lysosome under nutrient-depleted conditions. Ex vivo lysine or arginine depletion resulted in increased apoptosis. Genetic inhibition of AMPK, inhibition of mTORC1, or restoration of cell viability with a Bcl-x transgene failed to rescue B cell development in -deficient mice. -deficient B cell progenitors exhibited increased nuclear localization of transcription factor binding to IgHM enhancer 3 (TFE3) in developing B cells, which correlated with an increased expression of TFE3-target genes, increased lysosome numbers and function, and increased autophagic flux. These results indicate that Fnip1 modulates autophagy and energy response pathways in part through the regulation of AMPK, mTORC1, and TFE3 in B cell progenitors.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676465>Abnormal C-reactive protein blood levels as a specific biomarker of major depression and non-remission under antidepressants in schizophrenia.</a></h2><p>C-reactive protein (CRP) is a general marker of peripheral inflammation and has been shown to be a good marker of neuroinflammation. CRP has been found to be elevated in patients with mood disorders (especially unipolar disorders (UD) and in schizophrenia (SZ)) but also to be lowered by antidepressants.The objectives were (i) to determine the prevalence of major depression, antidepressant prescription and remission under antidepressant in a stabilized population of SZ and UD patients consulting in a daily hospital, and (ii) to determine if CRP was a marker of major depression and remission under antidepressant in these SZ and UD populations.Abnormal CRP was defined by a CRP blood level ≥ 3 mg/L. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Calgary Depression Rating Scale score. The clinicians were blinded of the CRP status of the patient.411 patients were included (272 SZ and 139 UD). 171 (41.6%) were diagnosed with current major depression (74 (27.2%) for SZ and 97 (69.8%) for UD). 86 SZ (31.6%) and 119 UD (85.6%) were treated by antidepressant. Only 28/74 (37.8%) of the SZ subjects with major depression were administered antidepressants vs. 87/97 (89.7%) for UD. The non-remission rate under antidepressant was 28/86(32.6%) for SZ and 87/119 (73.1%) for UD. Overall, 105 (40.1%) of SZ and 39 (28.1%) of UD patients were found to have abnormal CRP blood levels. Abnormal CRP levels were significantly associated with increased MDD and more strongly with increased rates of non-remission under antidepressants in SZ patients, independently of age, gender, psychotic symptomatology, functioning, tobacco smoking and . This result was not replicated in UD patients, which suggests that CRP may be a specific marker of major depression and remission under antidepressant in SZ patients.The development of biomarkers in psychiatry may orientate specific etiologic therapies in patients with mental disorders. The present findings suggest that major depression is frequent in SZ patients and that increased CRP levels are associated with non-remission under antidepressants in this population. Anti-inflammatory strategies may be particularly useful in this specific population.Copyright © 2019.

DNA, extracted from dried blood cards was collected as part of the regular NBS program. As cystinosis has a prevalence of only 1:100,000-1:200,000, a molecular genetic assay for detection of the SMN1 gene mutation with a higher prevalence was also included in the screening process, a genetic defect that leads to spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). First tier multiplex PCR was employed for both diseases. The cystinosis screening employed assays for the three most common  mutations covering 75% of German patients; in case of heterozygosity for one of these mutations, samples were screened by next generation sequencing (NGS) of the CTNS exons for 101  mutations. A detection rate of 98.5% is predicted using this approach.Between January 15, 2018 and May 31, 2019, 257,734 newborns were screened in Germany for cystinosis. One neonate was diagnosed with cystinosis, consistent with the known incidence of the disease. No false positive or false negatives were detected so far. Screening, communication of findings to parents, and confirmation of diagnosis were accomplished in a multi-disciplinary setting. This program was accomplished with the cooperation of hospitals, physicians, and parents. In the neonate diagnosed with cystinosis, oral cysteamine treatment began on day 18. After 16 months of treatment the child has no clinical signs of renal tubular Fanconi .This pilot study demonstrates the efficacy of a molecular-based neonatal screening program for cystinosis using an existing national screening framework.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677034>Bacterial staphylokinase as a promising third-generation drug in the treatment for vascular occlusion.</a></h2><p>Vascular occlusion is one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity. Blood vessel blockage can lead to thrombotic complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, deep venous thrombosis, peripheral occlusive disease, and pulmonary embolism. Thrombolytic therapy currently aims to rectify this through the administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Research is underway to design an ideal thrombolytic drug with the lowest risk. Despite the potent clot lysis achievable using approved thrombolytic drugs such as alteplase, reteplase, streptokinase, tenecteplase, and some other fibrinolytic agents, there are some drawbacks, such as high production cost, systemic bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, vessel re-occlusion by platelet-rich and retracted secondary clots, and non-fibrin specificity. In comparison, bacterial staphylokinase, is a new, small-size plasminogen activator, unlike bacterial streptokinase, it hinders the systemic degradation of fibrinogen and reduces the risk of severe hemorrhage. A fibrin-bound plasmin-staphylokinase complex shows high resistance to a-antiplasmin-related inhibition. Staphylokinase has the potential to be considered as a promising thrombolytic agent with properties of cost-effective production and the least side effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667794>Clinical and neuroradiological notes on non-extrapyramidal bent spine .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673695>Fibrous dysplasia/McCune-Albright : a rare, mosaic disease of Gαs activation.</a></h2><p>Fibrous dysplasia/McCune-Albright  (FD/MAS) is a rare disorder of striking complexity. It arises from somatic, gain-of-function mutations in GNAS, leading to mosaic Gαs activation and inappropriate production of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP). The clinical phenotype is largely determined by the location and extent of affected tissues, and the pathophysiologic effects of Gαs activation within these tissues. In bone, Gαs activation results in impaired differentiation of skeletal stem cells, leading to discrete skeletal lesions prone to fracture, deformity, and pain. Extraskeletal manifestations include a variable combination of hyperpigmented macules and hyperfunctioning endocrinopathies. Distinctive age-related changes in disease development has key effects on histologic, radiographic, and clinical features. FD/MAS thus presents along a uniquely broad clinical spectrum, and the resulting challenges in diagnosis and management can be difficult for clinicians. This review presents FD/MAS in the context of a mosaic disorder of Gαs activation, providing an intellectual framework within which to understand, evaluate, and treat this interesting disease. It includes a comprehensive summary of current understanding of FD/MAS pathogenesis, and a detailed discussion of clinical presentation and management. Critical areas of unmet need are highlighted, including discussion of key challenges and potential solutions to advance research and clinical care in FD/MAS.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Endocrine Society 2019.

However, evidence for an inverse connection between dietary fiber consumption and asymptomatic colonic diverticulosis is lacking. Specifically, few studies have investigated this subject in Asians with different presentations of diverticulosis. Therefore, we assessed the protective effects of a vegetarian diet for asymptomatic colonic diverticulosis in Buddhist monks who are obligatory vegetarians for spiritual reasons compared with the general population.A retrospective, cross-sectional, case-control study was conducted in age- and sex-matched Buddhist monks and the general population who underwent colonoscopy for screening at a Korean health promotion center from August 2005 to June 2018. We compared the prevalence of asymptomatic diverticulosis between the 2 groups using a self-administered questionnaire.In this study, a total of 1,316 individuals were included (Buddhist monks of 658 and general population of 658) with a mean age of 52.6±9.5 years. The prevalence of asymptomatic diverticulosis in Buddhist monks was lower compared with the general population (6.7% [44/658] vs. 10.8% [71/658], P=0.008). Buddhist monks had a higher rate of high body mass index (BMI) and .

Data from the 2009-2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey which is cross-sectional, nationwide, and representative survey were used. Adjusted regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association of obesity and MetS with lung function in children and adolescents. A total of 763 children and adolescents aged 10-18 years were evaluated. We found no significant difference in FEV% predicted, FVC% predicted, and FEV/FVC ratio among the obesity groups. Subjects with MetS showed a significantly lower FEV predicted (91.54 ± 0.74% vs 94.64 ± 0.73%, P = 0.004), lower FVC% predicted (91.86 ± 0.63% vs 95.20 ± 0.63%, P < 0.001), and lower FEV/FVC ratio (76.76 ± 0.43% vs 80.13 ± 0.43%, P < 0.001) than those without MetS. Elevated waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were independently associated with lower FEV/FVC ratio (all P < 0.05, respectively).

Therefore, we aimed to conduct the first dose-response meta-analysis to investigate this effect.A systematic search in PubMed and Web of Science databases from their inception to June 01, 2019, together with relevant literature scrutiny, was performed to identify related studies for inclusion into the meta-analysis. We calculated the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random effects model. Furthermore, subgroup, sensitivity, heterogeneity, and publication bias analyses were performed. This meta-analysis included 14 cross-sectional and four cohort studies, totaling 284,638 participants and 69,554 MetS cases. The highest versus the lowest carbohydrate intake values were associated with an increased risk of MetS (OR: 1.253, 95% CI: 1.147-1.368), with moderate heterogeneity (I = 54.5%). Using dose-response analysis, we found a linear association between carbohydrate consumption and MetS risk with a corresponding OR of 1.026 (95% CI, 1.004-1.048) and with significant heterogeneity (I = 82.0%) at 5% energy intake from carbohydrates. We have found similar results using subgroup analyses for major study characteristics and adjustment for confounders. Sensitivity analysis further enhanced the robustness of the results, and no publication bias was detected.Carbohydrate intake is associated with an increased risk of developing MetS. Therefore, additional large prospective cohort studies are warranted to confirm our findings.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

It is characterized by chronic anovulation leading to menstrual disorders, and increased infertility. The  can also manifest as hirsutism and acne.The aim of the study was to compare, over a duration of 6 months, the effects of drospirenone (DRSP) versus chlormadinone acetate (CMA) containing oral contraceptives (OCs) on clinical, hormonal, and  parameters in 120 PCOS women.120 women with the diagnosis of PCOS according to the Rotterdam 2003 criteria were recruited to the study. All patients were divided to two treatment groups of OCs, containing: 3 mg DRSP/30 mcg EE (ethinylestradiol) (60 patients) and 2 mg CMA/30 mcg EE (60 patients). Clinical parameters such as hirsutismus and acne were evaluated.  parameters such as serum insulin, glucose concentration, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also measured. Among hormonal parameters, serum estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free thyroxine were measured.The use of both DRSP- or CMA-containing OCs provided similar positive therapeutic effects with regard to clinical, , and hormonal parameters. Among clinical parameters, like hirsutismus, after 6 months of continuous OC treatment, a statistically significant improvement was observed in both groups: DRSP (p <  0.0001) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.0001). In addition, significant improvement was showed according to acne lesions both after DRSP (p < 0.0001) and CMA treatments (p < 0.0001). Among glucose, insulin levels and HOMA-IR, there were statistically significant higher levels in both groups after DRSP (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.05) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.02, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001). Hormonal parameters such as LH, FSH, prolactin, testosterone and DHEA-S were statistically significant lower in both groups after DRSP (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.01, p < 0,002, and p < 0.0001) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.04, p < 0.002, and p < 0.0001).Further research, however, is needed not only to define optimal duration, and to clarify the effects of treatment on long-term  outcomes, but also to explore different treatment options and possible combined therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642000> is a predictor of decreased renal function among community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly Japanese.</a></h2><p> (MetS) is increasing worldwide with the continuous increase in obesity prevalence. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also a major public health problem, but there is controversy over whether baseline MetS is a predictor of decreased renal function among Japanese community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly Japanese.We conducted a prospective cohort study designed as part of the Nomura study. We recruited a random sample of 410 men aged 68 ± 8 (mean ± standard deviation; range, 50-95) years and 549 women aged 69 ± 7 (50-84) years during their annual health examination in a single community. We examined the relationship between baseline MetS and renal dysfunction after a 3-year evaluation based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the CKD-EPI equations modified by the Japan coefficient. CKD was defined as dipstick-positive proteinuria (> or = 1 +) or a low eGFR (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m).Of the 959 participants, 413 (43.1%) had MetS at baseline. Annual eGFR decline rate was significantly greater in those with MetS than in those without MetS, and the annual eGFR decline rate of < - 1.2 mL/min/1.73 m/year increased significantly in relation to presence of baseline MetS, especially low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). Moreover, the incidence rate of CKD after 3 years was 13.5% and increased significantly in relation to presence of baseline MetS, especially its components such as elevated HbA1c. The multivariate-adjusted odd ratio (OR) for CKD in participants with MetS versus those without MetS was 1.55 (0.99-2.43). The multivariate-adjusted ORs for rapid annual eGFR decline rate were significantly high in patients aged ≥ 65 years and presence of medication, regardless of gender and eGFR value.Low HDL-C and elevated HbA1c levels correlated significantly with eGFR decline in a short period of 3 years. MetS also showed a significant association with eGFR decline. This study suggests the importance of low HDL-C and elevated HbA1c in the effect of MetS on eGFR decline rather than obesity among Japanese community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly Japanese without CKD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645009>Cardamonin suppresses lipogenesis by activating protein kinase A-mediated browning of 3T3-L1 cells.</a></h2><p>Obesity develops when dietary energy intake exceeds energy expenditure, and can be associated with . Recent studies have shown that dietary phytochemicals can promote energy expenditure by inducing the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT).This study investigated whether cardamonin induces the browning of 3T3-L1 adipocytes through the activation of protein kinase A (PKA).Anti-obesity potential of cardamonin was evaluated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Adipocyte-specific genes were observed using western blot, qPCR analysis and immunocytochemistry.Cardamonin treatment inhibited lipid droplet accumulation and reduced the expression of the adipogenic proteins C/EBPα and FABP4, and the lipogenic proteins LPAATθ, lipin 1, DGAT1, SREBP1, and FAS. Cardamonin also induced the expression of the browning marker genes PRDM16, PGC1α, and UCP1 at the mRNA and protein levels, and induced mRNA expression of CD137, a key marker of beige adipocytes. It also increased the expression of the β-oxidation genes CPT1 and PPARα at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, cardamonin increased PKA phosphorylation and the mRNA and protein expression of the downstream lipolytic enzymes adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).Our findings demonstrate novel effects of cardamonin to stimulate adipocyte browning, suppress lipogenesis, and promote lipolysis, implying it may have potential as an anti-obesity agent.Copyright © 2019.

Basic characteristics of this disease are hypertension, reduced concentration of aldosterone and renin activity, as well as increased excretion of potassium leading to low level of potassium in serum and  alkalosis. The cause of Liddle  is missense or frameshift mutations in SCNN1A, SCNN1B, or SCNN1G genes that encode epithelial sodium channel subunits.We describe a family with Liddle  from Russia. 15-year-old proband has arterial hypertension, hypokalemia, hyporeninemia,  alkalosis, but aldosterone level is within the normal range. At 12 years of age, arterial hypertension was noticed for the first time. We identified novel frameshift mutation c.1769delG (p.Gly590Alafs) in SCNN1G, which encodes the γ subunit of ENaC in vertebrates. The father and younger sister also harbor this heterozygous deletion. Treatment with amiloride of proband and his sister did not normalize the blood pressure, but normalized level of plasma renin activity.Our results expand the mutational spectrum of Liddle  and provide further proof that the conserved PY motif is crucial to control of ENaC activity.

The initial study reported eleven families, and the  was defined as presenting early in life with hypotonia, facial dysmorphia, and developmental delay that evolved into intellectual disability (ID) and/or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We have now identified an additional 27 families through a genotype-first approach. Familial segregation analysis, clinical phenotyping, and bioinformatics were capitalized on to assess potential variant pathogenicity, and molecular modelling was performed for those variants falling within structurally characterized domains of TAF1. A novel phenotypic clustering approach was also applied, in which the phenotypes of affected individuals were classified using 51 standardized Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. Phenotypes associated with TAF1 variants show considerable pleiotropy and clinical variability, but prominent among previously unreported effects were brain morphological abnormalities, seizures, hearing loss, and heart malformations. Our allelic series broadens the phenotypic spectrum of TAF1/MRXS33 intellectual disability  and the range of TAF1 molecular defects in humans. It also illustrates the challenges for determining the pathogenicity of inherited missense variants, particularly for genes mapping to chromosome X. This article is protected by copyright.

To address this need, we developed a -associated non-coding RNA database (ncRNA2MetS) to curate the associations between  and non-coding RNA. Currently, ncRNA2MetS contains 1,068 associations between five  traits and 627 non-coding RNAs (543 miRNAs and 84 lncRNAs) in four species. Each record in ncRNA2MetS database represents a pair of disease-miRNA (lncRNA) association consisting of non-coding RNA category, miRNA (lncRNA) name, name of  trait, expressive patterns of non-coding RNA, method for validation, specie involved, a brief introduction to the association, the article referenced, etc. We also developed a user-friendly website so that users can easily access and download all data.

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is associated with cardiovascular, , and hormonal status. Selenium, a micronutrient with antioxidant properties, could affect multiple physiological pathways. This study aimed to investigate the effect of selenium supplementation on ADMA, cardiometabolic risk factors, and hormonal status in women with PCOS. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 66 women with PCOS, aged 18-45 years, were randomly assigned to receive either 200 μg/day selenium or placebo, for 12 weeks. Circulating concentrations of ADMA, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), lipid profiles, and glycemic parameters were assessed at baseline and following supplementation. ADMA concentration decreased significantly compared to baseline values (85.14 ± 75 to 56.4 ± 38.64 ng/l, p = 0.02) in the selenium group. This change was marginally significant compared with the placebo group (28.74 ± 68.63 vs. - 1.77 ± 52.88 ng/l, p = 0.056). Serum testosterone levels declined significantly in the intervention compared to the placebo group (0.01 ± 0.17 vs. - 0.08 ± 0.18 ng/ml, p = 0.038). Pre- to post-Apo-B100/Apo-A1 ratio declined considerably in the intervention group (0.72 ± 0.16 to 0.65 ± 0.16, p = 0.003). No further differences were observed in SHBG, lipid profiles, Apo-A1, Apo-B100, Apo-B100/Apo-A1 ratio, and glycemic control between the two groups at the end of the study. Selenium supplementation for 12 weeks had beneficial effects on reduction of circulating ADMA and total testosterone levels in women with PCOS. No significant improvements were seen in other cardiometabolic risk factors. The effects of selenium supplementation on hormonal, reproductive, and cardiometabolic disorders, considering the potential mediating role of ADMA, should be further investigated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669643>Role of the NF-κB signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>The NF-κB signaling pathway is a key regulator of CRC cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, inflammation, metastasis, and drug resistance.

Most traditional methods are expensive and time-consuming; therefore, developments of rapid, simple, specific, and sensitive methods for the assessment of vitamins and minerals in biological samples are of high importance in research. Aptamers are synthetic nucleic acid single-stranded DNA or RNA that can be synthesized . They can be engineered to be analyte-specific and have been suggested as a substitute for monoclonal antibodies, due to their high sensitivity and affinity. In addition, aptamers can be chemically synthesized and readily modified for use as biosensors. These features make aptamers a promising tool for the detection of biological analytes. In this review, we provide an overview of the potential use of aptamer-based biosensors. Search terms were conducted on several online databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct from January 2000 to August 2019. Eligibility criteria were used and quality evaluation was performed. Following the review of 4349 articles, 39 articles met the inclusion criteria. Aptasensors have recently been developed for the detection of vitamins by using optical methods, with a detection range from 74 pM to 204 pM, and lower limit of detection of 2.4 pM. Both electrochemical and optical methods have been used for detection of minerals, however electrochemical methods show a wider linear range and lower detection limits compared to optical methods with a wide linear range from 0.2 fM to 1.0 mM and limit of detection of 14.7 fM. The current report reviews recent developments in aptamer-based biosensors for detection of vitamins and minerals. Studies have shown that aptasensors' properties are suitable for the quantification of vitamins and minerals with high sensitivity, affinity, and specificity. Nevertheless, the limitations and future directions of aptamers require further research and new technological innovation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654729>Cluster patterns of behavioural risk factors among children: Longitudinal associations with adult cardio- risk factors.</a></h2><p>Much of what is known about childhood clusters of cardiovascular disease behavioural risk factors (RFs) comes from cross-sectional studies, providing little insight into the long-term health impacts of different behavioural cluster profiles. This study aimed to establish the longitudinal relationship between cluster patterns of childhood behavioural RFs and adult cardio- RFs. Data were from an Australian prospective cohort study of 1265 participants measured in 1985 (ages 9-15 yrs), and in 2004-06 (ages 26-36 yrs). At baseline, children self-reported smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity (PA), dietary behaviour and psychological well-being. At follow-up, participants completed questionnaires and attended study clinics where the following component indicators of the  (MetS) score were measured: waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and lipids. TwoStep cluster analyses were carried out to identify clusters in childhood. Linear regression was used to examine the longitudinal associations between cluster patterns of childhood behavioural RFs and adult cardio- RFs. Four childhood cluster patterns of behavioural RFs labelled 'most healthy', 'high PA', 'most unhealthy', and 'breakfast skippers' were identified. The unhealthier childhood clusters predicted a significantly higher adult MetS score ('most unhealthy': β = 0.10, 95%CI = 0.01, 0.19) and adult waist circumference ('most unhealthy': β = 2.29, 95%CI = 0.90, 6.67; 'breakfast skippers': β = 2.15, 95%CI = 0.30, 4.00). These associations were independent of adult behavioural RFs and socio-economic position. These findings emphasise the impact of multiple childhood behavioural RFs on important adult health outcomes and may be useful for the development of early intervention strategies, where identification of children at higher risk of poorer adult cardio- health is vital.Copyright © 2018.

Evidence has shown that physical activity can positively impact age-related health conditions, yet exercise trials in older adults with mental disorders are rare. Our study was a tailored and targeted pilot exercise intervention for older veterans with PTSD.Fifty-four older veterans with PTSD (mean age = 67.4 years, 90.7% male, 85.2% non-white) were randomized to supervised exercise (n=38) or wait-list usual care (WL; n=18) for 12 weeks. Physical activity (MET-min/wk) and aerobic endurance (assessed with the 6-minute walk test), were primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were physical performance (strength, mobility, balance), cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g., waist circumference), and health-related quality of life.At 12 weeks, a large effect of the intervention on physical activity levels (Cohen's d=1.37) was observed compared to WL. Aerobic endurance improved by 69 meters in the exercise group compared to 10 meters in WL, reflecting a moderate between-group effect (Cohen's d=.50). Between-group differences on 12-week changes in physical performance, cardiometabolic risk factors, and health-related quality of life ranged from small to large effects (Cohen's d=.28-1.48), favoring the exercise arm.Participation in supervised exercise improved aerobic endurance, physical performance, and health-related clinical factors in older veterans with PTSD; a medically complex population with multiple morbidity. Group exercise is a low-cost, low-stigma intervention and implementation efforts among older veterans with PTSD warrants further consideration.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America 2019.

The mechanisms by which maternal obesity can induce alterations in fetal and later neonatal metabolism are not fully elucidated due to its complexity and multifactorial causes. Two adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, are involved in fetal and postnatal growth trajectories, and both are altered in women with pregestational obesity. The placenta synthesizes leptin, which goes mainly to the maternal circulation and in lesser amount to the developing fetus. Maternal pregestational obesity and hyperleptinemia are associated with placental dysfunction and changes in nutrient transporters which directly affect fetal growth and development. By the other side, the embryo can produce its own leptin from early in development, which is associated to fetal weight and adiposity. Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, is downregulated in maternal obesity. High molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin is the most abundant form and with most biological actions. In maternal obesity lower total and HMW adiponectin levels have been described in the mother, paralleled with high levels in the umbilical cord. Several studies have found that cord blood adiponectin levels are related with postnatal growth trajectories, and it has been suggested that low adiponectin levels in women with pregestational obesity enhance placental insulin sensitivity and activation of placental amino acid transport systems, supporting fetal overgrowth. The possible mechanisms by which maternal pregestational obesity, focusing in the actions of leptin and adiponectin, affects the fetal development and postnatal growth trajectories in their offspring are discussed.Copyright © 2019.

The most feasible explanation for this association is the hypothesis of catch up. Some studies postulate a greater influence of catch up growth than the low birth weight itself in developing  and cardiovascular disease.This is a prospective cohort study of newborns with intrauterine growth restriction (defined as weight percentile at birth less than 10th) born during a one-year period. Clinical data of patients were recorded (gender, gestational age, data about breastfeeding and anthropometry during follow-up every 3 months). Some details of pregnancy and characteristics of the mother were also registered. Serum biochemical parameters (IGF-1, IGF-BP3, insulin, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, DLD cholesterol, triglycerides, HOMA) were collected at birth from cord blood, 9 and 12 months. Two main comparative groups were established: those GRF who made a catch-up growth (increase in weight Z score higher than 0,67) during the follow-up and those who did not get it.126 GRF children were born in the study period. 125 accepted the inclusion in the study and 67 of them completed the full monitoring for a year; 47 of them made recovery growth and 20 did not. A significant difference between both groups was found in glucose in umbilical cord and triglycerides at 12 months: GRF children with catch up growth showed lower glucose levels (p = 0.03) and higher levels of triglycerides (p = 0.03). There were no statistically significant differences in the rest of laboratory parameters analyzed (IGF-1, IGF-BP3, insulin, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, DLD cholesterol, HOMA at 9 and 12 months or triglycerides at 9 months).Those GRF with catch up growth during the first year of life have early changes in the triglycerides at the end of that period with higher levels than those GRF children without catch up growth. This finding could be useful to develop a tool for early detection of GRF children with higher  risk in order to prevent future pathology.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Here, we report clinical, biochemical and neuroimaging findings from nine unrelated children carrying GFM1 variants, 10 of which were not previously reported. All patients presented with neurological involvement-mainly axial hypotonia and dystonia during the neonatal period-with five diagnosed with West ; two children had liver involvement with cytolysis episodes or hepatic failure. While two patients died in infancy, six exhibited a stable clinical course. Brain MRI showed involvement of basal ganglia, brainstem and periventricular white matter. Mutant EFG1 and OXPHOS proteins were decreased in patient fibroblasts consistent with impaired mitochondrial translation.

We hypothesized that MetS confers an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in severely injured trauma patients.We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients from 2014 through 2018, excluding patients <16 years of age, ISS <16, and with incomplete height and/or weight documentation. MetS was defined as the presence of diabetes, hypertension, and a BMI ≥30 kg/m. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), complications, discharge location, and mortality.There were 4,491 patients meeting criteria of which 100 (2.2%) had MetS. Patients with MetS were older (64.0 vs 38.6 years, p<.0001) but similar in ISS (22 vs 22, p=.70). Hospital LOS was significantly longer with MetS (16.5 vs 11 days, p <.0001) as was ICU LOS (9 vs 5 days, p=.0002). MetS correlated with higher rates of AKI (19% vs 3.6%,p<.0001), ARDS (11.0% vs 4.6%, p=.01), cardiac arrest (10.0% vs 4.0%, p=.01), MI (2.0% vs 0.3%, p=.05), severe sepsis (8.0% vs 3.3%, p=.03), unplanned intubation (11.0% vs 5.0%, p=.02), unplanned ICU admission (13.0% vs 6.1%, p=.02), and non-home discharge (51.0% vs 30.2%, p=.0007). After controlling for age, GCS, ISS, gender, and mechanism, MetS remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.33-4.7, p=.004).MetS occurs infrequently in our severely injured trauma population but is strongly associated with increasing LOS as well as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, and renal complications. MetS also significantly and independently predicts death and should be identified early to facilitate prompt multidisciplinary treatment.Copyright © 2019.

Generally, normal individual can exhibit 2- to 10-folds rise in serum cortisol levels during stressful period. But patients with panhypopituitarism are more prone to develop  and haemodynamic instability particularly during stressful perioperative period. This can potentially increase significant morbidity and mortality.A 62-year-old female patient presented with breathlessness on exertion. Her coronary angiography revealed critical triple vessel coronary artery disease, and she was scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. She had been diagnosed with Sheehan's  (postpartum hypopituitarism) since 20 years. She was taking steroid and thyroxine regularly. After uneventful off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, patient had severe haemodynamic compromise with Addisonian crisis in the post-operative phase. Left ventricular dysfunction was refractory to maximal inotropic therapy. Addisonian crisis was treated with higher 'Stress doses' of intravenous hydrocortisone and routine oral thyroxin.Acute Addisonian crisis after stressful surgery is a life-threatening complication.

It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for . Current research has shown that hepatic fatty acid accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway. Mitochondria are the major sites of fatty acid β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of fatty acids. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty acid-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty acid accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and .Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680948>Characterization of the Therapeutic Profile of Albiflorin for the .</a></h2><p>Albiflorin (AF) is a small molecule (MW 481) isolated from , a plant used as a remedy for various conditions with pathogenesis shared by  diseases. Reported here is our characterization of its therapeutic profiles in three mouse models with distinctive pathological features of  (MetS). Our results firstly showed that AF alleviated high fat (HF) induced obesity and associated glucose intolerance, suggesting its therapeutic efficacy for MetS. In the type 2 diabetes (T2D) model induced by a combination of HF and low doses of streptozotocin, AF lowered hyperglycaemia and improved insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. In the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-like model resulting from a HF and high cholesterol (HF-HC) diet, AF reversed the increased liver triglyceride and cholesterol, plasma aspartate aminotransferase, and liver TNFα mRNA levels. Consistent with its effect in promoting glucose disposal in HF-fed mice, AF stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in L6 myotubes. However, these effects were unlikely to be associated with activation of insulin, AMPK, ER, or cellular stress signalling cascades. Further studies revealed that AF increased the whole-body energy expenditure and physical activity. Taken together, our findings indicate that AF exerts a therapeutic potential for MetS and related diseases possibly by promoting physical activity associated whole-body energy expenditure and glucose uptake in muscle. These effects are possibly mediated by a new mechanism distinct from other therapeutics derived from Chinese medicine.Copyright © 2019 Zhou, Fouda, Zeng, Li, Zhang, Xu and Ye.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661963>Nutritionally attenuating the human gut microbiome to prevent and manage .</a></h2><p> (MSyn) constitutes a litany of pathophysiological conditions such as central adiposity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia.

At the vascular level, T presents genomic and non-genomic effects, and both effects may overlap. The genomic actions assume that androgens can freely cross the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to nuclear androgen receptors, inducing gene transcription and protein synthesis. The non-genomic effects have a more rapid onset and may be related to the interaction with protein/receptor/ion channels of the plasma membrane.

Insulin resistance appears to be a key component underlying these  complications. Long-term, continuous, GH treatments in short children born SGA lead to a normalization of height through childhood to adulthood. Recombinant human GH has been proven to be relatively safe. We recommend early surveillance in a growth clinic for children born SGA without catch-up growth. Obesity, insulin resistance, and the risk of  increase with catch-up growth, but short stature and cognitive dysfunction increase without catch-up growth in children born SGA. A solution to this catch-up dilemma is breast feeding for a minimum of 6 to 12 mo. Because the overall prevalence of  risk factors is very low, routine evaluation of  parameters is not recommended for all children born SGA, but it may be useful to consider  evaluations in overweight or obese children born SGA.

Sterculic acid has been proposed as a potential tool for the treatment of MS since it inhibits the activity of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a central enzyme in lipid metabolism. We analyzed the effect of sterculic oil (SO) co-administration with 30% fructose in drinking water on the development of MS in male Wistar rats. After 8 weeks, 0.4% SO exerted a protective effect from MS development since parameters altered by fructose (blood pressure, insulin resistance, serum glucose and triglycerides, steatosis, and adiposity) were similar to those of control rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643938>Bile Acids.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are a large family of molecules that have a steroidal structure and are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and actively secreted along with cholesterol and phospholipids into the bile. Bile flowing from the liver is concentrated in the gallbladder and, in response to a meal, released into the upper intestine. In the intestines, bile acids act as detergents and help to emulsify fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. After participating in digestion in the small bowel, bile acids are almost completely (95%) reabsorbed in the distal ileum and then retaken up from portal blood by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The primary bile acids synthesized in the liver are cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid which are typically conjugated to glycine or taurine before secretion. In the intestine, the primary bile acids are often converted by colonic bacteria to the secondary bile acids, predominantly deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid. The reabsorbed bile acids are transported to the liver in portal blood. Conjugated bile acids are then retaken up by hepatocytes via the sodium taurocholate cotransporter (NTCT), while unconjugated bile acids are taken up by organic anion transporters that also take up bilirubin and other anions. The total bile acid pool in humans is tightly controlled by a coordinated regulation of expression of genes involved with synthesis, secretion, reabsorption and reuptake of bile acids by the liver. The major components of the bile acid pool are cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid with lesser amounts deoxycholic and lithocholic acid and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic acid. Bile acids also act as signaling molecules and are important in regulation of their own synthesis, uptake and secretion as well as control of cholesterol synthesis and regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. Bile acid levels are increased in the serum and liver in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholestasis and, perhaps because of their inherent detergent activities, can cause hepatocyte injury. Thus, increased bile acid levels in hepatocytes may account for some of the liver damage in cholestatic liver diseases. Bile acids can be used as therapeutic agents, particularly in patients with cholestatic liver diseases where administered bile acids (such as ursodeoxycholic acid) replace the more lipophilic and toxic bile acids that accumulate during cholestasis. Bile acids are also useful for the medical treatment (dissolution) of gallstones by increasing bile acid and decreasing cholesterol concentrations in bile (causing a less saturated bile). Bile acids can also be useful as replacement therapy in patients with bile acid synthetic defects. Finally, the other  effects of bile acids can be useful in treating  diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Four bile acids are currently approved for use in the United States and several others are under active investigation. Cholic acid is used for treatment of inherited defects in bile acid synthesis, chenodeoxycholic (chenodiol) and ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol) acid for gallstone dissolution, and obeticholic and ursodiol for chronic cholestatic liver diseases, specifically primary biliary cirrhosis. Obeticholic acid is under evaluation as therapy of other liver diseases including sclerosing cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Ursodiol is used off label to prevent, treat or ameliorate several uncommon forms of liver disease, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, sinusoidal obstruction , graft-vs-host disease, cystic fibrosis associated liver disease, parenteral nutrition related liver injury and even acute, drug induced liver injury. The long term efficacy in ameliorating the course of these diseases is, however, unproven. Separate documents are available in LiverTox for each of the currently available bile acids.

The purpose of this study is to explore the potential accuracy of this combination of three cytokines in screening PCOS.186 individuals were recruited for this study. Circulating Irisin, Betatrophin and ZAG concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The association between these serum biomarkers and PCOS was assessed by logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of these biomarkers for PCOS women.In women with PCOS, serum Irisin and Betatrophin levels were markedly elevated compared to those in healthy controls (p<0.01), while ZAG levels were lower (p<0.01). PCOS women with IR (M-value<6.28) had lower circulating ZAG concentrations, and higher circulating Irisin and Betatrophin levels relative to PCOS women without IR (M-value ≥ 6.28). ROC curve analyses showed that the AUC for Irisin, ZAG and Betatrophin for predicting PCOS were 0.77, 0.83 and 0.85, respectively. In a joint ROC curves analysis of these serum markers and other parameters, the results showed that the AUC was 0.93, and the sensitivity and specificity were 82.1 % and 92.3 %, respectively.When compared to using single cytokine, the analysis of Irisin, ZAG and Betatrophin elevates the accuracy in diagnosing PCOS.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668388>Focus on FKBP51: A molecular link between stress and  disorders.</a></h2><p>Obesity, Type 2 diabetes (T2D) as well as stress-related disorders are rising public health threats and major burdens for modern society.

Few studies have addressed the role of leptin in hypothyroid prediabetic patients and its effect on CHD risk factors.The aim of this study was to detect serum levels of leptin in hypothyroid prediabetic patients and their relationship with risk factors for CHD.The study included three groups; group A included 120 hypothyroid male patients with normal glucose tolerance, group B included 120 hypothyroid male patients with prediabetes, and group C included 120 healthy individuals matched for age and sex as a control group. All groups were subjected to assessment of history, clinical examination, and laboratory investigations including fasting and 2 h postprandial blood glucose, serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), free T3, free T4, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and fasting serum leptin.Serum leptin was significantly higher in groups A and B compared with group C (=0.0001), whereas there was no significant difference in serum leptin between groups A and B. In comparison with group A, the patients in group B had significantly higher serum TC (=0.02), LDL (=0.04), and lower serum HDL (=0.02). In group B, serum leptin correlated positively with serum TC (=0.0001), TG (=0.041), and LDL (=0.036), and negatively with serum HDL (=0.039).Hypothyroidism is associated with high serum leptin independent of prediabetic state.

The aim of this study was to analyze the ability of six anthropometric indices to identify MetS in the Polish population. The highest odds ratios for the occurrence of MetS, according to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), were noted for the following indices: waist-to-height ratio (WHtR, OR = 24.87) and Clínica Universidad de Navarra-body adiposity estimator (CUN-BAE, OR = 17.47) in men and WHtR (OR = 25.61) and body roundness index (BRI, OR = 16.44) in women. The highest odds ratios for the modified definition of MetS (without waist circumference) were found for the following indices: WHtR (OR = 7.32), BRI (OR = 6.57), and CUN-BAE (OR = 6.12) in women and CUN-BAE (OR = 5.83), WHtR (OR = 5.70), and body mass index (BMI, OR = 5.65) in men ( < 0.001 for all). According to the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses conducted for the identification of MetS, defined in accordance with IDF, the largest areas under the curve (AUCs) in men were observed for WHtR and CUN-BAE indices, whereas in women, they were observed for WHtR and BRI. In the analysis carried out for the identification of MetS (according to modified definition, without waist circumference), the AUCs were larger for WHtR and BRI in women, while in men, they were larger for CUN-BAE, BMI, and WHtR. BMI was also characterized by a relatively strong discriminatory power in identifying individuals with MetS. An optimal cut-off point for MetS, in accordance with the conventional definition, for both sexes was the value of BMI = 27.2 kg/m. The weakest predictor of the  was the ABSI (a body shape index) indicator. The most useful anthropometric indicator for the identification of MetS, both in men and in women in the Polish population, was WHtR.

PROK2 is also expressed in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) as an essential factor for neuro-and morphogenesis. Since the MOB was shown to be strongly involved in eating behavior, we hypothesized that PROK2 could be a new target in the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis, through its effects in the MOB. We also asked whether PROK2 could be associated with the pathophysiology of obesity, the  (MetS), and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in humans.We assessed in wild type mice whether the expression of Prok2 in the MOB is dependent on the nutritional status. We measured the effect of human recombinant PROK2 (rPROK2) acute injection in the MOB on food intake and olfactory behavior. Then, using a lentivirus expressing Prok2-shRNA, we studied the effects of Prok2 underexpression in the MOB on feeding behavior and glucose metabolism.  parameters and meal pattern were determined using calorimetric cages. In vivo 2-deoxyglucose uptake measurements were performed in mice after intraperitoneally insulin injection. Plasmatic PROK2 dosages and genetic associations studies were carried out respectively on 148 and more than 4000 participants from the D.E.S.I.R. (Data from an Epidemiologic Study on the Insulin Resistance ) cohort.Our findings showed that fasting in mice reduced Prok2 expression in the MOB. Acute injection of rPROK2 in the MOB significantly decreased food intake whereas Prok2-shRNA injection resulted in a higher dietary consumption characterized by increased feeding frequency and decreased meal size. Additionally, Prok2 underexpression in the MOB induced insulin resistance compared to scrambled shRNA-injected mice. In the human D.E.S.I.R. cohort, we found a significantly lower mean concentration of plasma PROK2 in people with T2D than in those with normoglycemia. Interestingly, this decrease was no longer significant when adjusted for Body Mass Index (BMI) or calorie intake, suggesting that the association between plasma PROK2 and diabetes is mediated, at least partly, by BMI and feeding behavior in humans. Moreover, common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in PROK2 gene were genotyped and associated with incident T2D or impaired fasting glycemia (IFG), MetS, and obesity.Our data highlight PROK2 as a new target in the MOB that links olfaction with eating behavior and energy homeostasis. In humans, plasma PROK2 is negatively correlated with T2D, BMI, and energy intake, and PROK2 genetic variants are associated with incident hyperglycemia (T2D/IFG), the MetS and obesity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

This may be related to dysbiosis and a reduction in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the gut microbiota caused by a decrease in the abundance of the Porphyromonadaceae family and, in particular, the  genus. It should also be noted that a high fat diet is also related to an increase in the genera , and , which have previously been related to dysbiotic processes. As diabetes mellitus type 2 is a risk factor for developing tuberculosis, these findings may prove useful in the search for new prophylactic strategies for this population subset.Copyright © 2019 Arias, Goig, Cardona, Torres-Puente, Díaz, Rosales, Garcia, Tapia, Comas, Vilaplana and Cardona.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646131>The association of vitamin D status and dietary calcium intake with individual components of the : a population-based study in Victoria, Australia.</a></h2><p>This study examined the associations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), dietary calcium (Ca) intake, and individual components of the  (MetS).We analyzed a population-based sample of 18-75-year-old adults (=3387) from the Victorian Health Monitor survey.After adjustment for sociodemographic, physical, and dietary factors, as well as other MetS components, every 10 nmol/l increment in 25-OHD was associated with reduced adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of elevated triglycerides (TG) [AOR: 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.74-0.84, <0.001], and higher fasting plasma glucose (AOR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.86-0.96, =0.002). After adjustment for confounders, every 500 mg/day increment in dietary Ca intake significantly reduced the odds of elevated diastolic blood pressure (AOR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.66-0.99, =0.038). When nine combinations of 25-OHD and Ca tertiles were examined, certain combinations were associated with reduced AOR for elevated TG (<0.001), when referenced against the combination of low 25-OHD (median: 33 nmol/l) and low Ca (median: 579 mg/day). At low 25-OHD, increasing Ca intake decreased the AOR for low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner, but at high 25-OHD; such effects of Ca were blunted.Higher vitamin D status and Ca intake or their combination were associated with reduced odds for a number of individual MetS components.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Our goal is to decipher the gene regulatory networks controlling EECs specification from enteroendocrine progenitors. In this context, we studied the role of the transcription factor Rfx6 which had been identified as the cause of Mitchell-Riley , characterized by neonatal diabetes and congenital malabsorptive diarrhea. We previously reported that Rfx6 was essential for pancreatic beta cell development and function; however, the role of Rfx6 in EECs differentiation remained to be elucidated.We examined the molecular, cellular, and  consequences of constitutive and conditional deletion of Rfx6 in the embryonic and adult mouse intestine. We performed single cell and bulk RNA-Seq to characterize EECs diversity and identify Rfx6-regulated genes.Rfx6 is expressed in the gut endoderm; later, it is turned on in, and restricted to, enteroendocrine progenitors and persists in hormone-positive EECs. In the embryonic intestine, the constitutive lack of Rfx6 leads to gastric heterotopia, suggesting a role in the maintenance of intestinal identity. In the absence of intestinal Rfx6, EECs differentiation is severely impaired both in the embryo and adult. However, the number of serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cells and mucosal 5-HT content are increased. Concomitantly, Neurog3-positive enteroendocrine progenitors accumulate. Combined analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA-Seq data revealed that enteroendocrine progenitors differentiate in two main cell trajectories, the enterochromaffin (EC) cells and the Peptidergic Enteroendocrine (PE) cells, the differentiation programs of which are differentially regulated by Rfx6. Rfx6 operates upstream of Arx, Pax6 and Isl1 to trigger the differentiation of peptidergic EECs such as GIP-, GLP-1-, or CCK-secreting cells. On the contrary, Rfx6 represses Lmx1a and Tph1, two genes essential for serotonin biosynthesis. Finally, we identified transcriptional changes uncovering adaptive responses to the prolonged lack of enteroendocrine hormones and leading to malabsorption and lower food efficiency ratio in Rfx6-deficient mouse intestine.These studies identify Rfx6 as an essential transcriptional regulator of EECs specification and shed light on the molecular mechanisms of intestinal failures in human RFX6-deficiencies such as Mitchell-Riley .Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

This condition is accompanied by an extensive series of relatively serious neuropsychiatric symptoms. The diagnosis of PANS is made by "exclusion", as the individual PANS symptoms overlap with a multiplicity of psychiatric disorders with onset in childhood. Several researchers accumulated evidence to support the hypothesis that PANS was closely associated with a variety of infections. In the last decade, metabolomics played an essential role in improving the knowledge of complex biological systems and identifying potential new biomarkers, as indicators of pathological progressions, or pharmacologic responses to therapy. The metabolome is considered the most predictive phenotype, capable to catch epigenetic differences, reflecting more closely the clinical reality at any given moment and thus providing extremely dynamic data. In the present work, we review the most recent hypothesis and suggested mechanisms of this condition and describe the case of a 10 year -year-old girl with PANS, before and after clarithromycin treatment. The main results of this case report are discussed from a metabolomics point of view. The alteration of several  pathways concerning the microbial activity highlights the possible role of the microbiome in the development of PANS. Furthermore, different  perturbations at the level of the protein biosynthesis, energy and amino acid metabolisms were observed and discussed. Based on our observations, we believe that metabolomics is a promising technology to unravel the mysteries of PANS in the near future.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641677>The Effect of an Education Program Based on Illness Perception on the Lifestyle of Patients with : A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to examine the effects of an education program based on illness perceptions on the lifestyle of patients with .This is a randomized controlled clinical trial on 80 patients with  referred to diabetic clinic affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences from August to November 2016.

This trend is driven largely by the recent surge in incidence of , non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Given the central role of the liver in lipid homeostasis, altered hepatic lipid metabolism has been identified as a contributing factor to hepatocellular carcinoma. Neoplastic cells are highly dependent on lipid metabolism as a source of energy and to support rapid cell division, and fatty acid derivatives play key roles in cell signaling. Aberrant expression of liver fatty acid–binding protein and changes in the ratio of saturated to unsaturated triacylglycerols have been shown to be associated with disease severity and subtype.

Data was analyzed for 144 subjects aged 2-19 who participated for a minimum of 12 consecutive months between 2002 and 2016. McNemar tests were used to determine differences in the proportion of participants who moved from abnormal values at baseline to normal at follow-up for a given clinical measure. Paired sample t-tests assessed differences in blood pressure and lipid levels. Multiple linear regression assessed the change in blood pressure or lipid levels associated with improvement in BMI% and BMI z-score.The majority were female (62.5%), mean age was 9.6, and 71% were Black. At baseline, 70.1% had severe obesity, systolic hypertension was present in 44, and 13.9% had diastolic hypertension. One-third had abnormally low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) at baseline, 35% had elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and 47% had abnormal total cholesterol (TC). The average difference in percentage points of BMI% at follow-up compared was - 3.0 (95% CI: - 5.0, - 1.1; p < 0.003).

Cystinosis is caused by mutations in the CTNS gene that encodes the lysosomal cystine carrier protein cystinosin. CTNS mutations result in either complete absence or reduced cystine transporting function of the protein. The diagnosis of nephropathic cystinosis is generally based on measuring leukocyte cystine level, demonstration of corneal cystine crystals by the slit lamp examination and confirmed by genetic analysis of the CTNS gene.A boy born to consanguineous Caucasian parents had the characteristic clinical features of the infantile nephropathic cystinosis including renal Fanconi  (polydipsia/polyuria,  acidosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, low molecular weight proteinuria, glycosuria, cystine crystals in the cornea) and elevated WBC cystine levels. Initially we performed RFLP analysis of the common in the Northern European population 57-kb deletion of proband's DNA, then a direct Sanger sequencing which revealed no mutations in the coding part of the CTNS gene. To confirm the diagnosis we performed RT-PCR analysis of total RNA obtained from patient-derived fibroblasts in combination with cDNA sequencing. This revealed the skipping of exon 4 and exon 5 in the CTNS in our patient. Therefore, we detected a novel 9-kb homozygous deletion in the CTNS gene at genomic DNA level, spanning region from intron 3 to intron 5. In order to identify the inheritance pattern of the deletion we analyzed DNA of proband's mother and father. Both parents were found to be heterozygous carriers of the CTNS mutation.Analysis of CTNS gene transcript allowed to identify a large homozygous deletion in the patient with infantile nephropathic cystinosis.

GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body insulin sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting fatty-acid β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651856>Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as a predictive marker of .</a></h2><p>Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) serves as a strong prognostic indicator for patients suffering from various diseases.

We used Cox proportional-hazard models (for 20-year CHD outcomes) and logistic regression (for 9-year diabetes outcomes) to compare incident disease risk associated with a race/ethnicity-specific MetS-severity Z-score (MetS-Z) calculated in participants who were fasting (≥8 h) or non-fasting. All analyses were adjusted for sex, race, education, income and smoking. MetS Z-scores were overall similar between participants who were always fasting vs. those non-fasting at Visits 1-3 (all values -0.1 to 0.4), while MetS-Z for participants who were non-fasting at Visit-4 were higher at each visit. Baseline MetS-Z was linked to future CHD when calculated from both fasting and non-fasting measurements, with hazard ratio (HR) for fasting MetS-Z 1.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42, 1.66) and for non-fasting 1.28 (CI 1.08, 1.51).

The summary ORs of MetS for the highest versus lowest categories were 1.23 (95% CI 1.10-1.38, I = 0, tau = 0, n = 5) for dietary GI, 1.06 (95% CI 0.89-1.25, I = 36.2%, tau = 0.0151, n = 6) for dietary GL. The summary OR was 1.12 (95% CI 1.00-1.26, I = 0, tau = 0, n = 3) per 5 GI units, 0.96 (95% CI 0.83-1.10, I = 33.4%, tau = 0.0059, n = 2) per 20 GL units.Dietary GI was positively associated with the prevalence of MetS. However, no significant association was found between dietary GL and the prevalence of MetS.

Patients of Met S were recruited from the Endocrinology and Diabetic Clinic of Sheikh Zayed Hospital Lahore, over the time span of 6 months from July to December 2016. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of ADRB3 was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism and of LXR-α by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction. The frequency of TT variant of ADRB3 T>C in Met S was 69 (34.5%) and in controls 89 (44.5%), frequency of TC 103 (51.5%) and 96 (48%), and of CC 28 (14%) and 15 (7.5%), respectively. In the recessive model (CC: TT + TC), CC genotype was found to be associated with the increased risk of Met S (P = 0.027; odds ratio [OR] = 2.09; confidence interval [CI] =1.08-4.03) and the association remained significant after controlling for the confounders such as age and sex. The frequency of GG variant of LXR-α G>A in Met S was 35 (17.5%) and in controls 15 (7.5%), GA 129 (64.5%) and 137 (68.5%), and AA 36 (18%) and 48 (24%), respectively.

A total of 130 420 participants (43 682 men and 86 738 women) were included in our study. Coffee consumption was categorized into 5 categories (0, <1, 1, 2-3, and ≥4 cups/day). We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervalS (CIs) using multivariate logistic regression. In this study population, the prevalence of MetS was 12 701 (29.1%) in men and 21 338 (24.6%) in women. High coffee consumption (≥4 cups/day) was associated with a lower prevalence of MetS compared with non-coffee consumers (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.70-0.90,  for trend <0.0001 in men; OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.62-0.78,  for trend <0.0001 in women). The multivariable-adjusted ORs for high fasting glucose decreased with increasing levels of coffee consumption in men (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.54-0.67,  for trend <0.0001) and women (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.63-0.79,  for trend <0.0001). For women, the multivariable-adjusted ORs for hypertriglyceridemia (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.75-0.93,  for trend = 0.0007) decreased with increasing levels of coffee consumption.

These infants have an uncertain long-term outcome and it is currently unclear around time of diagnosis, which infants are at higher risk of later fulfilling a CF diagnosis. In this study, we hypothesised that immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels, used in NBS as a marker of pancreatic disease and function, may reflect the degree of CFTR dysfunction in each individual and therefore would help to identify those with CRMS/CSPID who are later at risk for meeting the criteria of CF.In this longitudinal, prospective study, infants with CRMS/CFSPID and CF were recruited and followed in 9 CF clinics (Canada and Italy). We compared NBS IRT levels between CF and CRMS/CFSPID, and between children with CRMS/CFSPID→CF and CRMS/CFSPID→CRMS/CFSPID during the period of June 2007 to April 2016.Ninety eight CRMS/CFSPID and 120 CF subjects were enrolled. During the study period, 14 (14.3%) CRMS/CFSPID subjects fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for CF (CRMS/CFSPID→CF), while the diagnosis remained uncertain (CRMS/CFSPID→ CRMS/CFSPID) in 84 (85.7%) subjects. Significantly higher NBS IRT concentrations (ng/ml) were present in CF than CRMS/CFPSID (median (interquartile range): 143.8 (99.8-206.2) vs. 75.0 (61.0-105.9); P < 0.0001). Infants with CRMS/CFSPID→CF (n = 14) had significantly higher NBS IRT concentrations (ng/ml) than CRMS/CFSPID→ CRMS/CFSPID (n = 83) (median (interquartile range): 108.9 (72.3-126.8) vs. 73.7(60.0-96.0); P = 0.02).Amongst infants who tested positive on NBS for CF, there is a gradation of elevated NBS IRT concentrations. Infants with CF have higher NBS IRT levels than CRMS/CFPSID, and higher NBS IRT concentrations were present in infants with CRMS/CFSPID→CF than CRMS/CFSPID→ CRMS/CFSPID. NBS IRT concentrations, in concert with other factors, may have the potential to predict the likelihood of CF amongst infants with CRMS/CFSPID.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658057>Association of Cardiovascular and Alzheimer's Disease Risk Factors with Intracranial Arterial Blood Flow in Whites and African Americans.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a higher prevalence among African Americans. Targeting cardiovascular and  risk factors may be potential mechanisms to modify AD risk and address racial/ethnic disparities in AD dementia.This study investigated relationships among cardiovascular and  risk factors, APOE genotype, AD biomarkers, and intracranial arterial blood flow in Whites and African Americans enriched for AD risk.399 cognitively unimpaired adults from the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center completed physical and neuroimaging examinations. A 4D Flow MRI sequence (phase-contrast vastly under sampled isotropic projection imaging) measured intracranial arterial flow in the Circle of Willis. Linear mixed-effects regression models estimated relationships between risk factors and intracranial arterial flow and tested interactions with racial group, APOE genotype, and AD biomarkers, with separate models per risk factor.Higher fasting glucose was associated with lower intracranial arterial flow; no additional relationships between flow and risk factors were observed. Main effects of racial group were observed, without an interaction, indicating lower flow in African Americans compared to Whites. In race-stratified analyses, higher glucose and triglycerides were associated with lower flow for African Americans, but not for Whites. No main effects or interactions among risk factors, APOE, or AD biomarkers, and flow were observed.Elevated fasting glucose and triglycerides were associated with lower intracranial arterial flow; these relationships were more prominent in African Americans. Targeting  risk factors may impact intracranial arterial health. Additional research is needed to determine if this will impact disparities in dementia prevalence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653659>A uniparental isodisomy event introducing homozygous pathogenic variants drives a multisystem  disorder.</a></h2><p>Uniparental isodisomy (UPiD) is a rare genetic event that occurs when two identical copies of a single chromosome are inherited from one parent. Here we report a patient with a severe, multisystem  disorder who inherited two copies of chromosome 12 from her father. He was a heterozygous carrier of a variant in the muscle-specific enzyme 6-phosphofructokinase (PFKM) gene, and of a truncating variant in the pseudouridine synthase 1 (PUS1) gene (both on chromosome 12), resulting in a homozygous state of these mutations in his daughter. The PFKM gene functions in glycolysis and is linked to Tarui . The PUS1 gene functions in mitochondrial tRNA processing and is linked to myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA). Analysis of human dermal fibroblasts, which do not express PFKM, revealed a loss of PUS1 mRNA and PUS1 protein only in the patient cells compared to healthy controls. The patient cells also revealed a reduction of the mitochondrial-encoded protein MTCO1 while levels of the nuclear-encoded SDHA remained unchanged, suggesting a specific impairment of mitochondrial translation. Further destabilization of these cells is suggested by the altered levels of BAX, BCL-2, and TP53 proteins, alterations that become augmented upon exposure of the cells to DNA damage. The results illustrate the efficacy of UPiD events to reveal rare pathogenic variants in human disease, and demonstrate how these events can lead to cellular destabilization.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641249>Genetic contributions to NAFLD: leveraging shared genetics to uncover systems biology.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects around a quarter of the global population, paralleling worldwide increases in obesity and . NAFLD arises in the context of systemic  dysfunction that concomitantly amplifies the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. These interrelated conditions have long been recognized to have a heritable component, and advances using unbiased association studies followed by functional characterization have created a paradigm for unravelling the genetic architecture of these conditions. A novel perspective is to characterize the shared genetic basis of NAFLD and other related disorders. This information on shared genetic risks and their biological overlap should in future enable the development of precision medicine approaches through better patient stratification, and enable the identification of preventive and therapeutic strategies. In this Review, we discuss current knowledge of the genetic basis of NAFLD and of possible pleiotropy between NAFLD and other liver diseases as well as other related  disorders.

To determine the underlying mechanism for impaired bone formation, we modelled the disease by silencing SMS in human bone marrow - derived multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) derived from healthy donors. We found that silencing SMS in MSCs led to reduced cell proliferation and deficient bone formation in vitro, as evidenced by reduced mineralization and decreased bone sialoprotein expression. Furthermore, transplantation of MSCs in osteoconductive scaffolds into immune deficient mice shows that silencing SMS also reduces ectopic bone formation in vivo. Tag-Seq Gene Expression Profiling shows that deficient SMS expression causes strong transcriptome changes, especially in genes related to cell proliferation and  functions. Similarly, metabolome analysis by mass spectrometry, shows that silencing SMS strongly impacts glucose metabolism. This was consistent with observations using electron microscopy, where SMS deficient MSCs show high levels of mitochondrial fusion. In line with these findings, SMS deficiency causes a reduction in glucose consumption and increase in lactate secretion. Our data also suggests that SMS deficiency affects iron metabolism in the cells, which we hypothesize is linked to deficient mitochondrial function. Altogether, our studies suggest that SMS deficiency causes strong transcriptomic and  changes in MSCs, which are likely associated with the observed impaired osteogenesis both in vitro and in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670860>50 bp deletion in promoter superoxide dismutase 1 gene and increasing risk of cardiovascular disease in Mashhad stroke and heart atherosclerotic disorder cohort study.</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD), one of the main mortality causes worldwide is considered to be affected by general oxidative stress and inadequacy antioxidant system. Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), a cytosolic antioxidant enzyme has a key role in neutralizing the excessive prooxidant by scavenging the super oxide anions. SOD1 polymorphic variants exhibit the altered activity properties. In the current study, we are aimed to investigate the association between the SOD1 polymorphism and CVD prevalence. A 6-years case control follow up study was designed to genotype the 526 participants (311 controls and 215 cases) for studying the 50 bp INS/DEL polymorphism at SOD1 promoter gene and analyze their blood lipid profile and anthropometric characteristics. Among the two possible alleles of the SOD1 gene (Wild [W] and Mutant [M]) the meaningful association was detected between the Mutants' frequency and the prevalence of CVD patients (p-value <.001). The W and M allele refer to inserted and deleted 50 bp in the polymorphic site of the SOD1 promoter, respectively. The WM and MM genotypes' frequency which indicate the wild heterozygotes and Mutant homozygotes, respectively, were significantly correlated with the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (p-value <.001).

In this context, chrononutrition has appeared as a research field centered on the study of the interactions among biological rhythms, nutrition, and metabolism. This review summarizes the role of phenolic compounds in the modulation of biological rhythms, focusing on their effects in the treatment or prevention of chronic diseases. Heterotrophs are able to sense chemical cues mediated by phytochemicals such as phenolic compounds, promoting their adaptation to environmental conditions. This is called xenohormesis. Hence, the consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in phenolic compounds exerts several health benefits, mainly attributed to the product of their metabolism. However, the profile of phenolic compounds present in plants differs among species and is highly variable depending on agricultural and technological factors. In this sense, the seasonal consumption of polyphenol-rich fruits could induce important changes in the regulation of physiology and metabolism due to the particular phenolic profile that the fruits contain.

Insulin resistance is one of the primary factors contributing to  (MetS), causing elevated glucose and fatty acid concentrations in the blood. Smoking is associated with insulin resistance in a dose-dependent manner. It directly increases the risk for insulin resistance, mainly via hormone activation, and may indirectly cause insulin resistance due to its effects on abdominal obesity.

However, little is known either about developmental programming in subjects of normal birthweight, or about events between the ages which separate early programming and the occurrence of disease at late adulthood. We tested the hypothesis that circulating concentrations of leptin, adiponectin and insulin in young, healthy adults, born with a birth size within the normal range, are influenced by early life growth patterns. In an observational study of 188 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 25 years (97 males, 91 females) we investigated the association of  function with their birth size, their growth during childhood and their body composition. High plasma leptin in early adulthood, a risk factor for cardio-, was associated with low weight at age two years (correlation coefficient controlled for adult weight = -0.21, p<0.01). It was also positively associated with pre-prandial insulin and with HOMA (Homeostasis Model Assessment) insulin resistance. Leptin, leptin-adiponectin ratio and insulin correlated with lean mass, fat mass and percent fat (p<0.0001). In conclusion, high leptin in early adulthood was associated with both low weight at age two years and insulin resistance. We speculate that high leptin is developmentally programmed and can contribute to the association between low weight in early infancy and increased cardio- risk in adulthood in heathy subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668457>Circulating glutamate level as a potential biomarker for abdominal obesity and  risk.</a></h2><p>Circulating level of glutamate, a by-product of the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, has been positively correlated with visceral adipose tissue accumulation and waist circumference (WC).

The early identification of high-risk individuals is the key for halting these conditions. The world is facing a growing epidemic MetS although the magnitude in Egypt is unknown.  To describe MetS and its determinants among apparently healthy individuals residing in urban and rural communities in Egypt and to establish a model for MetS prediction.  A cross-sectional study was conducted with 270 adults from rural and urban districts in Alexandria, Egypt. Participants were clinically evaluated and interviewed for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and dietary habits. MetS was defined according to the harmonized criteria set by the AHA/NHLBI. The risk of ischemic heart diseases (IHDs), DM and fatty liver were assessed using validated risk prediction charts. A multiple risk model for predicting MetS was developed, and its performance was compared.  In total, 57.8% of the study population met the criteria for MetS and were at high risk for developing IHD, DM, and fatty liver. Silent CVD risk factors were identified in 20.4% of the participants. In our proposed multivariate logistic regression model, the predictors of MetS were obesity [OR (95% CI) = 16.3 (6.03-44.0)], morbid obesity [OR (95% CI) = 21.7 (5.3-88.0)], not working [OR (95% CI) = 2.05 (1.1-3.8)], and having a family history of chronic diseases [OR (95% CI) = 4.38 (2.23-8.61)]. Consumption of caffeine once per week protected against MetS by 27.8-fold. The derived prediction rule was accurate in predicting MetS, fatty liver, high risk of DM, and, to a lesser extent, a 10-year lifetime risk of IHD.  Central obesity and sedentary lifestyles are accountable for the rising rates of MetS in our society. Interventions are needed to minimize the potential predisposition of the Egyptian population to cardiometabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667610>Serum zonulin level is not elevated in patients with polycystic ovary  without .</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary  (PCOS) is a complex disorder with gynecological,  and carcinogenic effects. Increased intestinal permeability is related with obesity, insulin resistance, type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus. The existence of such a relationship between PCOS and intestinal permeability has come to an end. Zonulin can change intestinal permeability, and this effect is reversible. We studied the relation between zonulin and the hormonal and  parameters of PCOS.A total of 45 women with PCOS and 17 healthy women were included in the study. Histories were taken from all the participants, body mass indexes were calculated, and biochemical tests and suprapubic over ultrasonography were made. Zonulin was studied with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Serum zonulin levels were similar between PCOS and control groups (p = 0.893). In all participants, there were negative correlations between zonulin and the total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and non-HDL-cholesterol (respectively, p = 0.00, 0.018, 0.004, 0.002), there were boundary correlations with age and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (respectively, p = 0.052 and 0.058).

Little is known regarding thymus (THY) involution in this process. We sought to investigate the relationship between THY imaging detection/size and clinically relevant aging outcomes such as  (MetS), multimorbidity (MM), and frailty in PWH.This was a cross-sectional observational study including 665 HIV patients (81% males; median age, 53 years) attending Modena HIV  Clinic from 2014 to 2017. They underwent thoracic computed tomography scan as part of the medical assessment for cardiovascular disease, in which THY detection and size were reported using a semiquantitative score. Outcome measures were MetS, MM, and frailty.THY was detected in 27.0% of subjects; 71.1% showed THY size of grade 1-2, and 28.9% exhibited grade ≥3. Covariates that inversely correlated with THY detection were age, male gender, body mass index (BMI), and HIV duration. Covariates that inversely correlated with MetS were age, HIV duration, BMI, and THY grade 1-2. Covariates that inversely correlated with MM were age, HIV duration, and CD4 nadir. Covariates that inversely correlated with frailty were age, HIV duration, CD4 nadir, BMI, and THY detection.THY is inversely associated with MetS and frailty in PWH.© The Author(s) 2019.

Although surgical and non-surgical methods for reducing SAT exist, patients remain non-compliant because of potential adverse effects and cost. In this study, we developed a new minimally-invasive approach to achieve SAT reduction, using a microneedle (MN) patch prepared from gelatin, which is capable of regulating fat metabolism. Four gelatin types were used: three derived from fish (SA-FG, GT-FG 220, and GT-FG 250), and one from swine (SM-PG 280). We applied gelatin-based MN patches five times over 4 weeks to rats with high-fat diet (HD)-induced obesity, and determined the resulting amount of SAT. We also investigated the histological features and determined the expression levels of fat metabolism-associated genes in SAT using hematoxylin and eosin staining and western blotting, respectively. SAT decreased following treatment with all four gelatin MN patches. Smaller adipocytes were observed in the regions treated with SA-FG, GT-FG 250, and SM-PG 280 MNs, demonstrating a decline in fat accumulation. The expression levels of fat metabolism-associated genes in the MN-treated SAT revealed that GT-FG 220 regulates fatty acid synthase (FASN) protein levels. These findings suggest that gelatin MN patches aid in decreasing the quantity of unwanted SAT by altering lipid metabolism and fat deposition.Copyright © 2019 The Korean Society Of Toxicology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657510>The Buckwheat Iminosugar d-Fagomine Attenuates Sucrose-Induced Steatosis and Hypertension in Rats.</a></h2><p>This study examines the long-term functional effects of d-fagomine on sucrose- induced factors of  dysfunctions and explores possible molecular mechanisms behind its action.Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were fed a 35% sucrose solution with d-fagomine (or not, for comparison) or mineral water (controls) for 24 weeks.

To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free fatty acids (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the liver and utilization for fuel or gluconeogenesis in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte mitochondria were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major  controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like  condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Bcs1l mutant mice with severe CIII deficiency, energy deprivation and post-weaning lipolysis respond to fasting similarly to wild-type mice, suggesting largely normal systemic lipid mobilization and utilization mechanisms.Copyright © 2019.

Although obesity is usually defined as elevated body mass index (BMI), recent data indicate a superior role of waist circumference or hypertriglyceridemic waist (HTGW) over BMI in the assessment of cardiometabolic risk. In dyslipidemic patients, the specific contributions of risky waist, HTGW or BMI have not been evaluated as yet. 686 dyslipidemic subjects (322 males and 364 females) were enrolled into a cross-sectional study. In each subject basic antropometry (i.e. waist circumference, HTGW, BMI) and laboratory parameters of lipid profile and insulin resistance were determined. Cardiometabolic risk was given by fulfilling the criteria (harmonized definition) of . The significance of risky waist, HTGW and BMI were assessed by comparing the respective predictive values for the presence of . Dyslipidemic patients with risky waist, HTGW or high BMI have a more atherogenic lipid profile and higher insulin resistance compared to those without risky waist, HTGW or high BMI. Risky waist is stronger predictor of  (PPV 66 %, NPV 90 %) and thus poses a greater cardiometabolic risk than higher BMI per se does (PPV 42 %, NPV 97 %). The contribution of triglycerides (i.e. HTGW) to these predictive values is marginal (PPV 66 %, NPV 92 %). The present results highlight the superior role of waist circumference as a screening tool over BMI for the evaluation of cardiometabolic risk in dyslipidemic subjects. HTGW brings little additional benefit in risk stratification.

A total of 104,333 eligible men who participated in biennial examinations at least once from 2006 to 2015 were recruited. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the effects of MetS components on CRC risk.  During an 824,211.96 person-years follow-up, 394 CRC cases were verified. Participants with high waist circumference (≥90 vs. <90 cm) had a significantly higher risk of developing incident CRC (HR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.07-1.64). Compared with participants with no MetS components, the HRs (95% CI) of developing CRC for men with 1, 2, and ≥3 MetS components were 1.53 (1.01-2.32), 1.42 (0.94-2.14), and 1.70 (1.12-2.56), respectively. In addition, a statistically significant trend ( for trend =0.04) of increased CRC risk with an increasing number of abnormal MetS components was observed. Furthermore, compared with no MetS components, the combination of high waist circumference and elevated fasting blood glucose along with normal levels of the other 3 components, showed a 126% increased risk of CRC.  Our study suggests that CRC risk is correlated with the number of abnormal MetS components in Chinese men. Men with high waist circumference and elevated fasting blood glucose may have a higher CRC risk even if they do not meet the MetS diagnostic criteria.Copyright © 2019 Li, Chen, Wang, Feng, Lyu, Wei, Wen, Chen, Wu, Hang, Dai, Li and He.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657699>Are there any differences among psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in terms of  and cardiovascular risk factors?</a></h2><p>Although the frequency of  has been studied separately in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, there is no study that compares the prevalence of  in all three diseases.

The liver-related burden of NASH is likely to increase and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is probably to be the leading indication for liver transplantation by 2020, as a consequence of increased disease prevalence and of the lack of an effective treatment. The first step in the NAFLD development is represented by fat accumulation in the liver, a condition that is commonly associated with features of the . Notably, it has been acknowledged that the step from nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to NASH is key step in the NASH formation, and the mechanisms behind this transition have been extensively studied. Emerging evidence indicates that innate immunity is a driving force in NAFLD progression because it directly regulates all key pathogenic features of the disease processes, including  dysregulation, inflammation, and fibrosis. In this review, we summarize the currently available signaling pathways of NASH formation, including oxidative stress, NOD-like receptors (NLRs), mitochondria-associated pathways, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nuclear receptors, and other signal pathways, for the aim of a better understanding of this disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675161>Interaction of Gut Microbiota and High-sodium, Low-potassium Diet in Altering Plasma Triglyceride Profiles Revealed by Lipidomics Analysis.</a></h2><p>High-sodium and low-potassium (HNaLK) intake increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and .

One group (cluster 1), representing the majority of TG species detected, was downregulated, whereas the other group (cluster 2) was upregulated by antibiotic treatment. Interestingly, cluster 2 TGs were also regulated by the diet. Cluster 2 TGs exhibited greater carbon-chain length and double-bond content and included TGs composed of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, previously associated with reduced diabetes risk.The HNaLK diet interacts with gut bacteria to alter plasma lipid profiles, which may be related to its health effects.

However, whether this association is causal is still unclear. We aimed to test whether genetically lowered vitamin D levels were associated with MS and its  traits, using mendelian randomization (MR) methodology.Ten thousand six hundred fifty-five participants were enrolled from the SPECT-China study, which was performed in 23 sites in East China during 2014 to 2016. Using four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DHCR7, CYP2R1, GC and CYP24A1 genes with known effects on 25(OH) D concentrations, we created a genetic risk score (GRS) as instrumental variable (IV) to estimate the effect of genetically lowered 25(OH) D on MS and cardiometabolic risk factors. MS was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria.Lower measured 25(OH)D levels were associated with MS (OR 0.921, 95% CI 0.888, 0.954) after multivariable adjustment. However, the MR-derived odds ratio of genetically determined 25(OH) D for risk of MS was 0.977 (95% CI 0.966, 1.030).

Although gender differences in MetS are well documented, little is known about sex-specific differences in the pathogenesis of COPD, especially when combined with MetS. Consequently, it is not clear whether the same treatment regime has comparable efficacy in men and women diagnosed with MetS and COPD. In the present study using sodium glutamate, lipopolysaccharide, and cigarette smoke extract, we simulated lipid metabolism disorders, obesity, hyperglycemia, and pulmonary emphysema (comorbidity) in male and female C57BL/6 mice. We assessed the gender-specific impact of lipid metabolism disorders and pulmonary emphysema on angiogenic precursor cells (endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, cells of the lumen of the nascent vessel), as well as the biological effects of pegylated glucagon-like peptide 1 (pegGLP-1) in this experimental paradigm. Simulation of MetS/COPD comorbidity caused an accumulation of EPC (CD45CD31CD34), pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells in the lungs of female mice. In contrast, the number of cells involved in the angiogenesis decreased in the lungs of male animals. PegGLP-1 had a positive effect on lipids and area under the curve (AUC), obesity, and prevented the development of pulmonary emphysema. The severity of these effects was stronger in males than in females. Furthermore, PegGLP-1 stimulated regeneration of pulmonary endothelium. At the same time, PegGLP-1 administration caused a mobilization of EPC (CD45CD31CD34) into the bloodstream in females and migration of precursors of angiogenesis and vascular smooth muscle cells to the lungs in male animals. Gender differences in stimulatory action of pegGLP-1 on CD31 endothelial lung cells in vitro were not observed. Based on these findings, we postulated that the cellular mechanism of in vivo regeneration of lung epithelium was at least partly gender-specific.

Consequently, the effects of adolescent-onset mood and psychotic syndromes can have long term consequences. A key clinical challenge for youth mental health is to develop and test new systems that align with current evidence for comorbid presentations and underlying neurobiology, and are useful for predicting outcomes and guiding decisions regarding the provision of appropriate and effective care. Our highly personalised and measurement-based care model includes three core concepts: ▶ A multidimensional assessment and outcomes framework that includes: social and occupational function; self-harm, suicidal thoughts and behaviour; alcohol or other substance misuse; physical health; and illness trajectory. ▶ Clinical stage. ▶ Three common illness subtypes (psychosis, anxious depression, bipolar spectrum) based on proposed pathophysiological mechanisms (neurodevelopmental, hyperarousal, circadian). The model explicitly aims to prevent progression to more complex and severe forms of illness and is better aligned to contemporary models of the patterns of emergence of psychopathology. Inherent within this highly personalised approach is the incorporation of other evidence-based processes, including real-time measurement-based care as well as utilisation of multidisciplinary teams of health professionals. Data-driven local system modelling and personalised health information technologies provide crucial infrastructure support to these processes for better access to, and higher quality, mental health care for young people. CHAPTER 1: MULTIDIMENSIONAL OUTCOMES IN YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH CARE: WHAT MATTERS AND WHY?: Mood and psychotic syndromes present one of the most serious public health challenges that we face in the 21st century. Factors including prevalence, age of onset, and chronicity contribute to substantial burden and secondary risks such as alcohol or other substance misuse. Mood and psychotic syndromes most often emerge during adolescence and young adulthood, a period characterised by major physical and social change; thus, effects can have long term consequences. We propose five key domains which make up a multidimensional outcomes framework that aims to address the specific needs of young people presenting to health services with emerging mental illness. These include social and occupational function; self-harm, suicidal thoughts and behaviours; alcohol or other substance misuse; physical health; and illness type, stage and trajectory. Impairment and concurrent morbidity are well established in young people by the time they present for mental health care. Despite this, services and health professionals tend to focus on only one aspect of the presentation - illness type, stage and trajectory - and are often at odds with the preferences of young people and their families. There is a need to address the disconnect between mental health, physical health and social services and interventions, to ensure that youth mental health care focuses on the outcomes that matter to young people. CHAPTER 2: COMBINING CLINICAL STAGE AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS TO UNDERSTAND ILLNESS TRAJECTORIES IN YOUNG PEOPLE WITH EMERGING MOOD AND PSYCHOTIC SYNDROMES: Traditional diagnostic classification systems for mental disorders map poorly onto the early stages of illness experienced by young people, and purport categorical distinctions that are not readily supported by research into genetic, environmental and neurobiological risk factors. Consequently, a key clinical challenge in youth mental health is to develop and test new classification systems that align with current evidence on comorbid presentations, are consistent with current understanding of underlying neurobiology, and provide utility for predicting outcomes and guiding decisions regarding the provision of appropriate and effective care. This chapter outlines a transdiagnostic framework for classifying common adolescent-onset mood and psychotic syndromes, combining two independent but complementary dimensions: clinical staging, and three proposed pathophysiological mechanisms. Clinical staging reflects the progression of mental disorders and is in line with the concept used in general medicine, where more advanced stages are associated with a poorer prognosis and a need for more intensive interventions with a higher risk-to-benefit ratio. The three proposed pathophysiological mechanisms are neurodevelopmental abnormalities, hyperarousal and circadian dysfunction, which, over time, have illness trajectories (or pathways) to psychosis, anxious depression and bipolar spectrum disorders, respectively. The transdiagnostic framework has been evaluated in young people presenting to youth mental health clinics of the University of Sydney's Brain and Mind Centre, alongside a range of clinical and objective measures. Our research to date provides support for this framework, and we are now exploring its application to the development of more personalised models of care. CHAPTER 3: A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK FOR YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH: GUIDING HIGHLY PERSONALISED AND MEASUREMENT-BASED CARE USING MULTIDIMENSIONAL AND OBJECTIVE MEASURES: There is an urgent need for improved care for young people with mental health problems, in particular those with subthreshold mental disorders that are not sufficiently severe to meet traditional diagnostic criteria. New comprehensive assessment frameworks are needed to capture the biopsychosocial profile of a young person to drive highly personalised and measurement-based mental health care. We present a range of multidimensional measures involving five key domains: social and occupational function; self-harm, suicidal thoughts and behaviours; alcohol or other substance misuse; physical health; and illness type, stage and trajectory. Objective measures include: neuropsychological function; sleep-wake behaviours and circadian rhythms;  and immune markers; and brain structure and function. The recommended multidimensional measures facilitate the development of a comprehensive clinical picture. The objective measures help to further develop informative and novel insights into underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and illness trajectories to guide personalised care plans. A panel of specific multidimensional and objective measures are recommended as standard clinical practice, while others are recommended secondarily to provide deeper insights with the aim of revealing alternative clinical paths for targeted interventions and treatments matched to the clinical stage and proposed pathophysiological mechanisms of the young person. CHAPTER 4: PERSONALISING CARE OPTIONS IN YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH: USING MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASSESSMENT, CLINICAL STAGE, PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS, AND INDIVIDUAL ILLNESS TRAJECTORIES TO GUIDE TREATMENT SELECTION: New models of mental health care for young people require that interventions be matched to illness type, clinical stage, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and individual illness trajectories. Narrow -focused classifications often direct clinical attention away from other key factors such as functional impairment, self-harm and suicidality, alcohol or other substance misuse, and poor physical health. By contrast, we outline a treatment selection guide for early intervention for adolescent-onset mood and psychotic syndromes (ie, active treatments and indicated and more specific secondary prevention strategies). This guide is based on experiences with the Brain and Mind Centre's highly personalised and measurement-based care model to manage youth mental health. The model incorporates three complementary core concepts: ▶A multidimensional assessment and outcomes framework including: social and occupational function; self-harm, suicidal thoughts and behaviours; alcohol or other substance misuse; physical health; and illness trajectory. ▶Clinical stage. ▶Three common illness subtypes (psychosis, anxious depression, bipolar spectrum) based on three underlying pathophysiological mechanisms (neurodevelopmental, hyperarousal, circadian). These core concepts are not mutually exclusive and together may facilitate improved outcomes through a clinical stage-appropriate and transdiagnostic framework that helps guide decisions regarding the provision of appropriate and effective care options. Given its emphasis on adolescent-onset mood and psychotic syndromes, the Brain and Mind Centre's model of care also respects a fundamental developmental perspective - categorising childhood problems (eg, anxiety and neurodevelopmental difficulties) as risk factors and respecting the fact that young people are in a period of major biological and social transition. Based on these factors, a range of social, psychological and pharmacological interventions are recommended, with an emphasis on balancing the personal benefit-to-cost ratio. CHAPTER 5: A SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL TO SUPPORT HIGHLY PERSONALISED AND MEASUREMENT-BASED CARE IN YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH: Over the past decade, we have seen a growing focus on creating mental health service delivery models that better meet the unique needs of young Australians. Recent policy directives from the Australian Government recommend the adoption of stepped-care services to improve the appropriateness of care, determined by severity of need. Here, we propose that a highly personalised approach enhances stepped-care models by incorporating clinical staging and a young person's current and multidimensional needs. It explicitly aims to prevent progression to more complex and severe forms of illness and is better aligned to contemporary models of the patterns of emergence of psychopathology. Inherent within a highly personalised approach is the incorporation of other evidence-based processes, including real-time measurement-based care and use of multidisciplinary teams of health professionals. Data-driven local system modelling and personalised health information technologies provide crucial infrastructure support to these processes for better access to, and higher quality of, mental health care for young people.© 2019 AMPCo Pty Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649930>Cushing : The Role of MSCs in Wound Healing, Immunosuppression, Comorbidities, and Antioxidant Imbalance.</a></h2><p>Cushing  (CS), caused by glucocorticoid (GCs) excess, is strictly connected to onset of different  diseases and impaired wound healing. The source of excessively high levels of GCs allows the identification of endogenous and exogenous (iatrogenic) CS. Iatrogenic patients usually receive also anti-metabolites serving as the foundation to modern steroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy. Tissues mainly targeted by CS are bone and fat, both derived from progenitor cells named mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In addition, the pathogenic role of MSCs in other diseases sharing common properties with CS, such as an altered inflammatory profile and increased oxidative stress, has been identified. In this light, MSCs isolated from skin of control healthy subjects (C-MSCs), patients affected by endogenous CS (ENDO-MSCs), patients affected by iatrogenic CS (IATRO-MSCs) and patients affected by exogenous CS receiving steroid-sparing drugs (SS-MSCs), respectively, have been isolated and analyzed. ENDO- and IATRO-MSCs showed a reduced differentiative potential toward osteogenic and adipogenic lineages compared to C-MSCs, whereas SS-MSCs re-acquired the ability to differentiate, with a trend similar to control cells. In addition, MSCs from CS groups, compared to control MSCs, displayed a reduction in the secretion of cytokines (immune-suppression), a decreased expression of genes related to wound healing and a dysregulation of the enzymes/genes related to antioxidant capacity. In conclusion, our results suggest that the hallmarks of CS, such as wound healing impairment and immunosuppression, are already detectable in undifferentiated cells, which could be considered a potential therapeutic early target for control of CS.Copyright © 2019 Caffarini, Armeni, Pellegrino, Cianfruglia, Martino, Offidani, Di Benedetto, Arnaldi, Campanati and Orciani.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652121>Advances in the management of craniopharyngioma in children and adults.</a></h2><p>Background Childhood and adult-onset craniopharyngioma is a rare embryogenic tumor of the sellar, suprasellar, and parasellar region. Survival rates are high; however, tumor location and treatment sequalae including endocrine deficits, visual impairment,  complications, cognitive and psychosocial deficits can significantly impair patient's quality of life. There is considerable controversy regarding the optimal management of craniopharyngiomas. Subtotal resection of the tumor followed by targeted irradiation to avoid further hypothalamic damage is currently indicated. Novel insights in the tumor's molecular pathology present the possibility for targeted therapy possibly decreasing the rate and severity of treatment-associated morbidity. Conclusions Craniopharyngioma should be seen as a chronic disease. To achieve optimal outcomes a multidisciplinary team of specialized neurosurgeons, neuro-radiologists, neuro-oncologists, pathologists and endocrinologists should be involved in the diagnosis, planning of the surgery, irradiation and long-term follow-up.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638273>The cardiovascular risk profile of middle-aged women with polycystic ovary .</a></h2><p>Contradictory results have been reported regarding the association between polycystic ovary  (PCOS) and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Ten year Framingham risk score and the cardiovascular health score were calculated, and carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) was measured RESULTS: Mean age was 50.5 years (SD 5.5) in women with PCOS and 51.0 years (SD 5.2) in controls. Increased waist circumference, body mass index and hypertension were more often observed in women with PCOS (P<0.001). In women with PCOS the prevalence of type II diabetes and  was not significantly increased and lipid levels were not different from controls. cIMT was lower in women with PCOS (P<0.001). Calculated cardiovascular health and 10-year CVD risk were similar in women with PCOS and controls.Middle-aged women with PCOS exhibit only a moderately unfavorable cardiometabolic profile compared to age-matched controls, even though they present with an increased BMI and waist circumference. Furthermore, we found no evidence for increased (10-year) CVD risk or more severe atherosclerosis compared to controls from the general population.

Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity, especially in the kidneys, is an important mechanism linking obesity to hypertension. Some adipokines play important roles in elevating blood pressure (BP). Hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance stimulates sodium reabsorption, enhances sodium retention, and increases circulating plasma volume. Hyperinsulinemia also stimulates both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the SNS, resulting in the acceleration of atherosclerosis through the hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells, which contributes to increased peripheral vascular resistance. Obesity is associated with increased RAAS activity despite volume overload, as the tissue RAASs are stimulated in obese hypertensive individuals. Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated hypertension must also be considered in obese patients with resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea  (OSAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Some components of the gut microbiota contribute to BP control; therefore, gut dysbiosis caused by obesity might lead to increased BP. The ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat is higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, which may explain why Japanese patients are more susceptible to  disorders even though they are less obese than Caucasian individuals. Obesity-associated kidney dysfunction directly increases BP, leading to further deterioration of kidney function. A bodyweight reduction of more than 3% or 5 kg significantly lowers BP. Gastrointestinal bypass surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and its related  disorders, including hypertension. Because both obesity and hypertension are representative lifestyle-related disorders, lifestyle modification, especially to improve obesity, should be performed first as a treatment for hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683340>Markers of  in Patients with Pituitary Adenoma: A Case Series of 303 Patients.</a></h2><p>To assess the demographic characteristics and hormonal status of patients who presented to our clinic with pituitary adenoma and to demonstrate the presence, prevalence, and relationship of  parameters in these patients.

Our understanding of the mechanisms governing  redesign upon genomic instability, however, is highly rudimentary. Using Ercc1-defective mice and Xpg knock-out mice, we demonstrate that combined defects in transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) and in nucleotide excision repair (NER) directly affect bioenergetics due to declined transcription, leading to increased ATP levels. This in turn inhibits glycolysis allosterically and favors glucose rerouting through the pentose phosphate shunt, eventually enhancing production of NADPH-reducing equivalents. In NER/TCR-defective mutants, augmented NADPH is not counterbalanced by increased production of pro-oxidants and thus pentose phosphate potentiation culminates in an over-reduced redox state. Skin fibroblasts from the TCR disease Cockayne  confirm results in animal models. Overall, these findings unravel a mechanism connecting DNA damage and transcriptional stress to  redesign and protective antioxidant defenses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655510>Initial Regional Evaluation of Cystic Fibrosis Newborn Screening Program: Data from Mediterranean Coast of Turkey.</a></h2><p>Background/ aim: Since January 2015, Cystic Fibrosis Newborn Screening (CFNS) program has been implemented in Turkey. We aimed to evaluate the demographic, clinical and laboratory data of cases referred from the CFNS program, and to determine the most suitable cut-off value for immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT)-1 and immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT-2) that are used in CFNS program in Turkey.A total of 156 Turkish-Caucasian subjects were determined as positive cases during 3 years, January 2015-January 2018, and were referred to the Pediatric Pulmonology clinics of Akdeniz University Hospital, Antalya, Turkey, national CFNS program. The evaluation was made considering the IRT-1, IRT-2 values, demographic characteristics, sweat test results, CFTR genotypes, and diagnoses.Nine cases were diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Eight cases were diagnosed with CF-related  syndromes and three cases were determined as CF carriers. The ratio of CF to CF-related  was determined as 1.1:1. Considering the limits of the present CFNS program and IRT method, the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) for the referred cases was determined as 5.8%. When a cut-off value of 105.6 ng/ml was taken for IRT-1, sensitivity was 100%, specificity was 59% and PPV was 12.8%. For a cutoff value of 88.75 ng/ml for IRT-2, sensitivity was determined as 90%, specificity as 65% and PPV as 15.2%.This is the first detailed clinical study that has evaluated the data from the CFNS program in the Mediterranean coast of Turkey.

However, the underlying role of mitochondrial genetics has not yet been completely elucidated. Evaluation of D-loop nucleotide variations with respect to statistical significance and clinical data distribution.Genomic DNAs were extracted from the peripheral blood samples of patients with biopsy-proven 150 NASH as well as from 150 healthy individuals to explore the functional D-loop region responsible for the replication and transcription of the mitochondrial genome. DNA sequencing by capillary electrophoresis analysis was performed for the D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA containing the hypervariable region I, and restriction fragment length polymorphism with MnlI analysis was performed for the m.16189 T/C D-loop variant.The m.A16318C variant was detected only in patients with NASH and approached significance level. Based on clinical data, six variants associated with histological subgroups of NASH and NASH-complicated diseases were identified. In patients with NASH, the m.16129 AA genotype was associated with advanced-stage fibrosis; the m.16249 CC genotype was associated with advanced lobular inflammation and advanced-stage histological steatosis; the m.16296 TT genotype was associated with hypothyroidism; the m.16163 GG and m.16294 TT genotypes were associated with ; and the m.16256 TT+CT genotypes were associated with type II diabetes.

Therefore, insulin-sensitizing agents are suggested to improve both reproductive as well as  aspects of PCOS. This study aimed to compare the effects of metformin taken alone with that of a combination of metformin and pioglitazone on menstrual cycle, hormonal parameters, insulin resistance, and inflammatory biomarkers in women with PCOS. One hundred and six women with PCOS participated in the study. All subjects were randomized into two-arm intervention groups (Arm 1 and 2). Participants in Arm-1 received metformin (500 mg BD) daily while those in Arm-2 a combination of metformin (500 mg BD) and pioglitazone (15 mg BD) for 12 wks. Serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were measured using ELISA whereas insulin resistance was assessed using HOMA-IR. At baseline women with PCOS had significantly elevated circulating concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8.

The purpose of this study was to verify whether SPs mediate the relationship between stress and MetS.A 5-year prospective cohort study included 242 police officers from a rapid response unit engaged exclusively in maintaining law and order. Perceived stress levels were measured repeatedly with the demand-control-support and the effort-reward-imbalance questionnaires; insomnia symptoms were assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; excessive daytime sleepiness was measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. MetS and its components were evaluated at baseline and at follow-up.During 5-year follow-up period, 26 new cases of MetS were identified. Both occupational stress and SPs were significantly related to incident cases of MetS. Insomnia symptoms showed a highly significant association with MetS (aOR 11.038; CI95% 2.867-42.493). Mediation analysis confirmed that SPs mediate the relationship between stress and MetS. A reciprocal relationship was found between job stress and SPs. Work-related stress was a significant predictor of insomnia symptoms, short sleep duration, sleep dissatisfaction, and sleepiness. Compared to the reference group, police officers with SPs at baseline had significantly higher odds of reporting high stress at follow-up.SPs play a mediating role in the relationship between occupational stress and MetS.

Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal microbiota analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti-obesity property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness).

Both DM and hypertension are major risk factors, for end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular events and mortality. Strict blood pressure (BP) control in diabetics has been associated with a cardiovascular and renal risk decrease. Inhibitors of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) in the proximal tubule is a relatively novel class of agents for treatment of type 2 DM. Inhibition of SGLT-2 co-transporter combines proximal tubule diuretic and osmotic diuretic action leading to glucose reabsorption reduction and mild natriuretic and diuretic effects. On this basis, several studies showed that treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors can effectively decrease hyperglycemia but also increase BP control and reduce renal outcomes and cardiovascular mortality. Based on such evidence, the recent guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes now suggest that SGLT-2 inhibitors should be preferred among oral agents in combination with metformin, in patients at increased cardiovascular risk, chronic kidney disease or heart failure.

FibroScan can assess the level of liver fibrosis by using a liver stiffness score, and the level of liver steatosis by using the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) score. The logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve were applied to select significant predictors and assess their predictability. A final model that included all significant predictors that are found by univariate analysis, and a convenient model that excluded all invasive parameters were created.Of 1983 participants, 13.6% had a physical status that fulfilled MetS criteria.

This study included 154 patients with FMF (66 males and 88 females) and 154 controls (62 males and 92 females) with similar age and sex.MetS was more prevalent among the FMF patients compared to the controls (42.90% [95% CI: 34.9-51.1%) vs. 28.57% [95% CI: 21.6-36.4%); OR=1.88, 95% Cl: 1.17-3.01, P=0.009]. In the FMF group, we found higher SUA, number of MetS components, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and insulin compared to the control group (P<0.001, P<0.001, P=0.018, P=0.002, P=0.008, respectively). The prevalence of MetS (men: P<0.001, women: P<0.001) and number of MetS components (men: P<0.001, women: P<0.001) were significantly increased with increasing SUA quartiles in both sexes.The prevalence of MetS was higher in patients with FMF, and the prevalence of MetS and number of MetS components were significantly increased with increasing SUA quartiles in both men and women with FMF. SUA levels, as a biochemical marker, could be a strong and independent predictor of MetS in patients with FMF, and may provide substantial help with early diagnosis and management of MetS.© 2019 The Author(s).

The prevalence and the factors associated with the development of chronic CI in the population admitted to a Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) have not yet been clarified.An observational prospective cohort study was undertaken at the RICU of the University Hospital of Modena (Italy). Patients mechanically ventilated with ARF in RICU were enrolled. Demographics, severity scores (APACHEII, SOFA, SAPSII), and clinical condition (septic shock, pneumonia, ARDS) were recorded on admission. Respiratory mechanics and inflammatory- blood parameters were measured both on admission and over the first week of stay. All variables were tested as predictors of chronic CI through univariate and multivariate analysis.Chronic CI occurred in 33 out of 100 patients observed. Higher APACHEII, the presence of septic shock, diaphragmatic dysfunction (DD) at sonography, multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infection, the occurrence of a second infection during stay, and a C-reactive protein (CRP) serum level inceasing 7 days over admission were associated with chronic CI. Septic shock was the strongest predictor of chronic CI (AUC = 0.92 p < 0.0001).Chronic CI is frequent in patients admitted to RICU and mechanically ventilated due to ARF. Infection-related factors seem to play a major role as predictors of this .Copyright © 2019.

Diet composition may also affect their systemic concentrations during fasting and in the postprandial period. Hence, we studied the influence of sex steroids and obesity on the circulating levels of a panel of  cytokines in the fasting state and after single macronutrient challenges.On alternate days we submitted 17 women with polycystic ovary  (PCOS) (9 non-obese, 8 obese), 17 non-hyperandrogenic control women (9 non-obese, 8 obese) and 19 control men (10 non-obese, 9 obese) to isocaloric oral glucose, lipid and protein loads. Serum levels of omentin-1, vaspin, lipocalin-2, adipsin, PAI-1, chemerin, FGF-21 and FGF-23 were determined by Luminex multiplex technology.During fasting, obese patients presented higher levels of PAI-1, chemerin and adipsin but decreased FGF-23 and omentin-1 compared with non-obese subjects. Vaspin showed sexual dimorphism with lower levels in men than women with PCOS and female controls. Following macronutrient ingestion, most  cytokines presented a similar physiological response consisting of a decrease in circulating concentrations, which was inversely associated with the fasting levels of these molecules. Protein intake caused the major postprandial decrease whereas glucose did not significantly reduce PAI-1, FGF-23 and vaspin, and even increased FGF-21. Regardless of the macronutrient administered, vaspin levels showed a larger reduction in non-obese individuals while the decrease in PAI-1 was particularly noticeable in the obese subgroup. The postprandial reductions of omentin-1 and FGF-23 after glucose and protein loads were influenced by obesity. No major differences were found between patients with PCOS and male and female controls.Obesity, but not PCOS or sex, markedly influences  cytokine levels at fasting and after macronutrient ingestion. The observed postprandial decrease in their circulating concentrations might represent a physiological compensatory mechanism against food-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. This mechanism is altered by obesity and is differently modulated by macronutrients, suggesting a larger contribution of glucose to stressful postprandial responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658221>Perfluoroalkyl Substances and  in Firefighters: A pilot study.</a></h2><p>to compare association of Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) with  (MetS) profile among firefighters (FF) at airport to suburban FF METHODS:: cross sectional exploratory study, 47 male FF aged 18-62 years were enrolled from two fire departments in Ohio. Association between MetS outcome and log transformed serum concentrations of four PFASs was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression.PFASs serum concentrations were 18-74% higher in FF than the general population, and 21-62% higher in airport FF than suburban FF. Compared to US general population, an elevated risk of hypertension was noted in FF, but no significant association between PFASs and MetS was found.Current serum PFASs in FF are not associated with MetS risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671328>Searching food during the night: the role of video-polysomnography in the characterization of the night eating .</a></h2><p>To describe the video-polysomnographic (VPSG) features of the night eating  (NES), exploring the existence of potential subtypes.In this study, 20 consecutive patients with NES according to the most recent diagnostic criteria underwent an overnight VPSG. None of them presented with a sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). VPSG recordings were reviewed identifying all eating episodes. For each episode, eating latency (time delay from awakening to food intake), eating duration (time between eating onset to eating offset) and sleep latency after eating offset (time delay from eating offset to sleep) were calculated. Total episode duration was considered as the time between awakening and sleep latency after eating offset.Ten patients fulfilled the A1 core criterion for NES (evening hyperphagia with consumption of at least 25% of the daily caloric intake after the evening meal); within this group, eight patients also fulfilled the A2 criterion (at least two episodes of nocturnal eating per week) and were thus included in the evening hyperphagia (EH) subgroup. The remaining 10 patients satisfied only the A2 core criterion for NES, constituting the nocturnal ingestion (NI) subgroup. We recorded 20 eating episodes, seven in the EH group and 13 in the NI group. In the EH subgroup, three eating episodes occurred before sleep onset, one after an awakening from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage 1 sleep, two from NREM stage 2 and one from REM sleep. All 13 NI episodes occurred after an awakening from sleep (1 from NREM stage 1 sleep, 8 from NREM stage 2 and four from NREM stage 3). In EH patients, eating latency, total episode duration and sleep latency after eating offset were significantly longer than in NI patients.Our VPSG data from a case series of 20 patients referred to our center for nocturnal eating indicate potential different NES subtypes. This distinction may have an impact on patients' treatment and follow-up.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to investigate the potential role of 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning for the quantitative assessment of SSc-related active ILD.18F-FDG PET/CT scans and high resolution CT scans of eight SSc patients, including five with ILD, were analysed. For comparison, reference groups were included: eight SLE patients and four primary Sjögren's  (pSS) patients, all without ILD. A total of 22 regions of interest were drawn in each patient at apical, medial and dorsobasal lung levels. 18F-FDG uptake was measured as mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) in each region of interest. Subsequently, basal/apical (B/A) and medial/apical (M/A) ratios were calculated at patient level (B/A-p and M/A-p) and at tissue level (B/A-t and M/A-t).SUVmean values in dorsobasal ROIs and B/A-p ratios were increased in SSc with ILD compared with SSc without ILD (P = 0.04 and P = 0.07, respectively), SLE (P = 0.003 and P = 0.002, respectively) and pSS (P = 0.03 and P = 0.02, respectively). Increased uptake in the dorsobasal lungs and increased B/A-t ratios corresponded to both ground glass and reticulation on high resolution CT.Semi-quantitative assessment of 18F-FDG PET/CT is able to distinguish ILD from non-affected lung tissue in SSc, suggesting that it may be used as a new biomarker for SSc-ILD disease activity.© The Author(s) 2019.

We aimed to evaluate the utilization and outcome of severely obese patients with MetS who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG)  laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Using the 2015 and 2016  and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program database, data were obtained for patients with MetS undergoing LSG or LRYGB. There were 29,588 MetS patients (LSG: 58.7%  LRYGB: 41.3%). There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality (0.1% for LSG  0.2% for LRYGB, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.58, confidence interval (CI) 0.32-1.05,  = 0.07) or length of stay between groups (2 ± 2 for LSG  2.2 ± 2 days for LRYGB,  = 0.40). Compared with LRYGB, LSG was associated with significantly shorter operative time (78 ± 39  122 ± 54 minutes,  < 0.01), lower overall morbidity (2.3%  4.4%, AOR 0.53, CI 0.46-0.60,  < 0.01), lower serious morbidity (1.5%  2.3%, AOR 0.64, CI 0.53-0.76,  < 0.01), lower 30-day reoperation (1.2%  2.3%, AOR 0.52, CI 0.43-0.63,  < 0.01), and lower 30-day readmission (4.2%  6.6%, AOR 0.62, CI 0.55-0.69,  < 0.01). In conclusion, LSG is the predominant operation being performed for severely obese patients with MetS, and its popularity may in part be related to its improved perioperative safety profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653610>The Effect of  on the Occurrence of Restenosis After Carotid Endarterectomy.</a></h2><p>The  (MetS) is a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The effect of MetS on clinical outcome in patients with cerebrovascular disease remains largely unknown because conflicting results have been published. This study aimed to determine the influence of MetS on the occurrence of restenosis after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).All patients who underwent CEA between June 2003 and December 2014 in two tertiary academic referral centres in The Netherlands were included. MetS was defined if three or more of the following criteria were present: hypertension, obesity, high fasting serum blood glucose, high serum triglycerides, or low serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of ipsilateral restenosis after index surgery. The secondary outcome measure was (all cause) mortality during follow up. For the primary analysis, missing data were multiply imputed using multivariable imputation by chained equations. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to perform an adjusted analysis on the multiply imputed data sets.A total of 1668 CEA procedures (in 1577 patients) were performed. The presence or absence of MetS could not be determined in 263 patients because of missing data. There was no significant difference in freedom from restenosis in the MetS group vs. the no-MetS group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-1.23; p = .10) or in all cause mortality (HR 1.20; 95% CI 0.94-1.54; p = .14).This study shows that MetS does not predict restenosis after CEA. Also, the presence of MetS did not influence patient survival negatively.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It's unknown whether long-term consumption of maleic acid-modified starch is harmful to the human. However, many studies have indicated that maleic acid causes renal tubular damage in animal models, even as the associated pathways remain unclear. Sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH) is the most innovative of the label-free quantitative technologies, which have better quantification performance. Therefore, SWATH technology was used to investigate the effect of maleic acid on rat kidney proteome in this study.SD rats were treated with 0 mg/kg (control), 6 mg/kg (low-dose), 10 mg/kg (medium-dose) and 60 mg/kg (high-dose) of maleic acid. After kidney protein extraction, 28% SDS-PAGE was used, followed by in-gel digestion and desalting. Next, the samples were analyzed with ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with Q-TOF MS, and data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and SWATH technology were also used. The gene ontology and pathway analysis were accomplished. Ultimately, these protein biomarkers were validated by using scheduled high-resolution multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM ).Comparisons of the control group with the other three groups revealed that 95, 130, and 103 proteins were expressed at significantly different levels from in the control group in the low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively. According to the gene ontology analysis, the major processes that these proteins were involved in were  processes, biological regulation, cellular processes, and responses to stimuli; the major functions these proteins were involved in were binding, hydrolase activity, catalytic activity, and oxidoreductase activity; and the major cellular components they were involved in were the cytoplasm, extracellular region, membrane, and mitochondria. According to the KEGG pathway analysis, these proteins were involved in 35 pathways, 5 of which, including the carbohydrate metabolism, folate biosynthesis, renal tubular resorption, amino acid metabolism, and Ras signaling pathways, are discussed in this study. Ultimately, 19 proteins involved in 12 important pathways were validated by sMRM .It was demonstrated that maleic acid caused insufficient energy production, which might lead to a decrease in the activity of the sodium-potassium ATP pump and hydrogen ion ATP pump, which could have in turn caused renal tubular resorption and hydrogen ion regulation to be blocked, thus leading to the accumulation of hydrogen ions in the renal tubules, which would then result in renal tubular acidification followed finally by Fanconi .This article is protected by copyright.
