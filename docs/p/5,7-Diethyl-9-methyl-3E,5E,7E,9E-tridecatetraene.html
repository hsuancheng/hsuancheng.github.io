Mechanisms for avoidance of hypervalency and for spin delocalization and spin polarization.</a></h2><p>The results are reported of an ab initio study of bromine dioxide BrO2, 1, and of the T-shaped trans- and cis-dihydroxides 2 and 3 of dihydrogen bromate (HO)2BrO. The thermochemistry has been explored of potential synthetic routes to (HO)2BrO involving water addition to BrO2, hydroxyl addition to bromous acid HOBrO, 4, protonation/reduction of bromic acid HOBrO2, , via tautomers 6-8 of protonated bromic acid, and by reduction/protonation of bromic acid via radical anion [HOBrO2](-), 9. The potential  surface analyses were performed at the MP2(full)/6-311G* level (or better) and with the consideration of aqueous solvation at the SMD(MP2(full)/6-311G*) level (or better), and higher-level energies were computed at levels up to QCISD(full,T)/6-311++G(2df,2pd)//MP2. The addition of RO radical to bromous acid or bromite esters and the reduction of protonated bromic acid or protonated bromate esters are promising leads for possible synthetic exploration. Spin density distributions and molecular electrostatic potentials were computed at the QCISD(full)/6-311G*//MP2(full)/6-311G* level to characterize the electronic structures of 1-3. Both radicals employ maximally occupied (pseudo) π-systems to transfer electron density from bromine to the periphery. While the formation of the (3c-) π-system suffices to avoid hypervalency in 1, the formation of the (4c-) π-system in 2 or 3 still leaves the bromine formally hypervalent and (HO)2BrO requires delocalization of bromine density into σ*-SMOs over the trans O-Br-O moiety. Molecular orbital theory is employed to describe the mechanisms for the avoidance of hypervalency and for spin delocalization and spin polarization. The (4c-) π-system in 2 is truly remarkable in that it contains five π-symmetric spin molecular orbitals (SMO) with unique shapes.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26674732>Elevation of serum interleukins 8, 4, and 1β levels in patients with gastrointestinal low-grade B-cell lymphoma.</a></h2><p>Proinflammatory cytokines that are produced by helper T cells (Th) regulate immune reactions, facilitate class switching of B cells, and prolong the lifespan of B and T cells. Eradication therapy using antibiotics is sometimes effective against gastrointestinal (GI) malignant lymphoma, suggesting that the tumor development or progression is affected by the inflammatory microenvironment. In the present study, serum samples from 148 patients with various subtypes of malignant lymphoma were tested for 11 proinflammatory Th1/Th2 cytokines. In the comparison by subtype or GI lesions, serum interleukin (IL)-8 (P = 6.-05), IL-4 (P = 7.-05), and IL-1β (P = 0.0043) levels showed significant differences among subtypes, being particularly elevated in follicular lymphomas (FL) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. Serum IL-8 levels were elevated in GI-FL and MALT lymphomas, and serum IL-4 and IL-1 β levels were elevated in MALT lymphomas. These findings show that GI low-grade B-cell lymphoma could develop against the background of an inflammatory microenvironment. Thus, these cytokines may be useful as diagnostic markers and could provide new insights into tumor development.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26174627>Aberrant DNA methylation impacts gene expression and prognosis in breast cancer subtypes.</a></h2><p>DNA methylation has a substantial impact on gene expression, affecting the prognosis of breast cancer (BC) patients dependent on molecular subtypes. In this study, we investigated the prognostic relevance of the expression of genes reported as aberrantly methylated, and the link between gene expression and DNA methylation in BC subtypes. The prognostic value of the expression of 144 aberrantly methylated genes was evaluated in ER+/HER2-, HER2+, and ER-/HER2- molecular BC subtypes, in a meta-analysis of two large transcriptomic cohorts of BC patients (n = 1,938 and n = 1,640). The correlation between gene expression and DNA methylation in distinct gene regions was also investigated in an independent dataset of 104 BCs. Survival and Pearson correlation analyses were computed for each gene separately. The expression of 48 genes was significantly associated with BC prognosis (p < 0.05), and 32 of these prognostic genes exhibited a direct expression-methylation correlation. The expression of several immune-related genes, including CD3D and HLA-A, was associated with both relapse-free survival (HR = 0.42, p = 3.-06; HR = 0.35, p = 1.-08) and overall survival (HR = 0.50, p = .-04; HR = 0.68, p = 4.-02) in ER-/HER2- BCs. On the overall, the distribution of both positive and negative expression-methylation correlation in distinct gene regions have different effects on gene expression and prognosis in BC subtypes. This large-scale meta-analysis allowed the identification of several genes consistently associated with prognosis, whose DNA methylation could represent a promising biomarker for prognostication and clinical stratification of patients with distinct BC subtypes.© 2015 UICC.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25469663>Lutein derived fragments exhibit higher antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties than lutein in lipopolysaccharide induced  in rats.</a></h2><p>In the present study, we appraise the anti-inflammatory efficacy of lutein oxidative degradation derivatives mediated through UV-irradiation over lutein in counteracting the  induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats (n =  per group). UV-irradiated lutein fragments were identified as anhydrolutein (B, C40H54O), 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,4-dienylium (M1, C9H13), (2E,4E,6E,8E)-9-(4-hydroxy-2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-1en-1-yl)-3,7-dimethylnona-2,4,6,8-tetraen-1-ylium (M2, C20H29O), 4-[(1E,3E,,)-3,7,-dimethyldeca-1,3,,7-tetraen-1-yl]-3,,-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-ol (M3, C21H30O) and zeaxanthin (M4, C40H56O) and its isomers as 13'-Z zeaxanthin, 13'-Z lutein, all-trans zeaxanthin, and 9-Z lutein. Induction of  by LPS significantly increased the production of nitrites (3.3 fold in the serum and 2.6 fold in the liver), prostaglandin E2 (26 fold in the serum), and pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-α (6.6 fold in the serum), and interleukin-6 (4.8 fold in the serum). Oxidative derivatives of lutein, especially M1, M2 and M3, ameliorated acute  in rats by inhibiting the production of nitrites, malondialdehyde (MDA), PGE2, TNF-α, and IL-6 cytokines more efficiently than lutein in rats. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of derivatives might be related to the decrease of inflammatory cytokines and the increase of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S transferase, glutathione reductase), which would result in the reduction of iNOS, COX-2 and MDA and subsequently inflammatory responses.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26597855>Valence-band offset and forward-backward charge transfer in manganite/NiO and manganite/LaNiO3 heterostructures.</a></h2><p>The valence-band offset (VBO) of the La(0.67)Sr(0.33)MnO(3)/NiO (LSMO/NiO), LaMnO(3)/NiO (LMO/NiO), LSMO/LaNiO(3) (LSMO/LNO) and LMO/LaNiO(3) (LSMO/LNO) heterostructures has been investigated using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. The VBO values are calculated to be -0.72, -0.05, +1.43 and +1.51 eV for the LSMO/NiO, LSMO/LNO, LMO/LNO and LMO/NiO heterostructures, respectively. Hence, when compared with NiO and LNO, the valence band of LSMO is shifted to a lower binding , whereas that of LMO is shifted to a higher binding . In addition, the charge transfer at the interfaces has been depicted as Mn(3.3+) + 0.→ Mn(2.6+), Mn(3.3+) + 0.1e→ Mn(3.2+), Mn(3.0+)- 0.4e→ Mn(3.4+) and Mn(3.0+)- 0.→ Mn(3.+) for the LSMO/NiO, LSMO/LNO, LMO/LNO and LMO/NiO heterostructures, respectively. Thus, the charge transfer procedure can be described as electron hopping from NiO and LNO to LSMO in the LSMO/NiO and LSMO/LNO heterostructures, and electron hopping from LMO to NiO and LNO in the LMO/NiO and LSMO/LNO heterostructures. Therefore, the charge transfer is dependent on the VBO, and the charge transfer direction can be determined from the negative or positive values of the VBO.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28770304>Effects of concentration of corn distillers dried grains with solubles and enzyme supplementation on cecal microbiota and performance in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>With the increasing production of ethanol for biofuels, a by-product of corn-based ethanol fermentation, dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) is finding its way into the feed of agricultural animals including cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep, goats, aquaculture species and horses. Corn DDGS contains very high levels of non-starch polysaccharides and could be considered a good source of fibre. Despite knowledge of the role of the fibre in modulating intestinal microbiota and consequently influencing health, there is currently little information on the interactions between DDGS and intestinal microbiota. We assessed the changes in the cecal microbiota of broilers feed rations supplemented with DDGS (five concentrations: 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24% w/w) with and without presence of digestive enzymes. DDGS concentration was strongly positively correlated (P = 3., r = 0.74) with feed conversion efficiency (FCR), diminishing broiler performance with higher concentrations. Additionally, DDGS concentrations positively correlated with Richness index (P = 1., r = 0.), increasing the number of detectable species in the cecum. Among the most affected genera, Faecalibacterium (P = 0.032, r = -0.34) and Streptococcus (P = 7.9e, r = -0.39) were negatively correlated with DDGS, while Turicibacter (P = 2.8e, r = 0.52) was positively correlated with the DDGS concentration.

The VIVA LA FAMILIA Study was designed to genetically map childhood obesity and associated biological processes in the Hispanic population. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) entailed genotyping 1.1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the Illumina Infinium technology in 815 children. Measured genotype analysis was performed between genetic markers and obesity-related traits i.e., anthropometry, body composition, growth, metabolites, hormones, inflammation, diet,  expenditure, substrate utilization and physical activity. Identified genome-wide significant loci: 1) corroborated genes implicated in other studies (MTNR1B, ZNF259/APOA5, XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2), DARC, CCR3, ABO); 2) localized novel genes in plausible biological pathways (PCSK2, ARHGAP11A, CHRNA3); and 3) revealed novel genes with unknown function in obesity pathogenesis (MATK, COL4A1). Salient findings include a nonsynonymous SNP (rs1056513) in INADL (p = 1.2E-07) for weight; an intronic variant in MTNR1B associated with fasting glucose (p = 3.-08); variants in the APOA5-ZNF259 region associated with triglycerides (p = 2.-4.8E-08); an intronic variant in PCSK2 associated with total antioxidants (p = 7.6E-08); a block of 23 SNPs in XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2) associated with serum TSH (p = .-08 to 1.0E-09); a nonsynonymous SNP (p = 1.3E-21), an intronic SNP (p = 3.6E-13) in DARC identified for MCP-1; an intronic variant in ARHGAP11A associated with sleep duration (p = .0E-08); and, after adjusting for body weight, variants in MATK for total  expenditure (p = 2.-08) and in CHRNA3 for sleeping  expenditure (p = 6.0E-08).

Phylogenetic analysis of the isolate using five loci suggests that it is closely related to Nigrograna mackinnonii CBS 674.75. The main component of the polyene series was purified and identified as (3E,,)-nona-1,3,,7-tetraene (NTE), a novel natural product. Non-oxygenated hydrocarbons of this chain length are uncommon and desirable as gasoline-surrogate biofuels. The biosynthetic pathway for NTE production was explored using metabolic labeling and gas chromatography time of flight mass spectometer (GCMS). Two-carbon incorporation (13)C acetate suggests that it is derived from a polyketide synthase (PKS) followed by decarboxylation. There are several known mechanisms for such decarboxylation, though none have been discovered in fungi. Towards identifying the PKS responsible for the production of NTE, the genome of N. mackinnonii E5202H (ATCC SD-6839) was sequenced and assembled. Of the 32 PKSs present in the genome, 17 are predicted to contain sufficient domains for the production of NTE.

SRC-PEEK, bulk isotropic PEEK, and the in-house-made PEEK fibers were analyzed for thermal transitions (T, T) through differential scanning calorimetry, crystallinity, crystal size, crystalline orientation (Hermanns orientation parameter) through wide-angle x-ray scattering, and modulus, tensile strength, yield stress, and strain to failure through monotonic tensile testing. SRC-insulated pin-on-disk samples were compared with metal-on-metal control samples in pin-on-disk fretting corrosion experiments using fretting current and fretting mechanics measurements. Fifty-micron cyclic motion at 2. Hz was applied to the interface, first over a range of loads (0.-35 N) while held at -0.05 V versus Ag/AgCl and then over a range of voltages (-0. to 0. V) at a constant contact stress of 73 ± 19 MPa for SRC-PEEK and 209 ± 41 MPa for metal-on-metal, which were different for each group as a result of changes in true contact area due to variations in modulus between sample groups. Pins, disks, and SRC samples were imaged for damage (on alloy and SRC surfaces) and evidence of corrosion (on alloy pin and disk surfaces). SRC specimens were analyzed for traces of alloy transferred to the surface using  dispersive spectroscopy after pin-on-disk testing.SRC-PEEK showed improved mechanical properties to bulk PEEK (modulus = .0 ± 0.3 GPa, 2.8 ± 0.1 GPa, respectively, p < 0.001) and higher crystallinity to bulk PEEK (44.2% ± 3%, 39.% ± 0.%, respectively, p = 0.039), but had comparable crystalline orientation as compared with the initial PEEK fibers. SRC-PEEK reduced fretting currents compared with metal-on-metal controls by two to three orders of magnitude in both variable load (4.0E- ± 3.8E- μA versus 2.9E-3 ± 7.1E-4 μA, respectively, p = 0.018) and variable potential (7.-6 ± 4.-6 μA versus .3E-3 ± 1.4E-3 μA, respectively, p = 0.022) fretting corrosion testing. Minimal damage was observed on surfaces insulated with SRC-PEEK, whereas control surfaces showed considerable fretting corrosion damage and metal transfer.The SRC-PEEK gaskets in this study demonstrated higher crystallinity and crystalline orientation and improved monotonic tensile properties compared with bulk PEEK with the ability to effectively insulate Ti6Al4V and CoCrMo alloy surfaces and prevent the initiation of fretting corrosion under high contact-stress conditions.This novel SRC-PEEK material may offer potential as a thin film gasket material for modular tapers. Pending further in vitro and in vivo analyses, this approach may be able to preserve the advantages of modular junctions for surgeons while potentially limiting the downside risks associated with mechanically assisted crevice corrosion.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28466299>Streptomyces sp.

These loci, comprising common variants, explain <10% of the phenotypic variance in height. We searched for novel associations between height and common (minor allele frequency, MAF ≥%) or infrequent (0.% < MAF < %) variants across the exome in African Americans. Using a reference panel of 1692 African Americans and 471 Europeans from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI) Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), we imputed whole-exome sequence data into 13 719 African Americans with existing array-based GWAS data (discovery). Variants achieving a height-association threshold of P < -06 in the imputed dataset were followed up in an independent sample of 1989 African Americans with whole-exome sequence data (replication). We used P < 2.-07 (=0.05/196 779 variants) to define statistically significant associations in meta-analyses combining the discovery and replication sets (N = 15 708). We discovered and replicated three independent loci for association: 5p13.3/C5orf22/rs17410035 (MAF = 0.10, β = 0.64 cm, P = 8.3E-08), 13q14.2/SPRYD7/rs114089985 (MAF = 0.03, β = 1.46 cm, P = 4.8E-10) and 17q23.3/GH2/rs2006123 (MAF = 0.30; β = 0.47 cm; P = 4.-09). Conditional analyses suggested 5p13.3 (C5orf22/rs17410035) and 13q14.2 (SPRYD7/rs114089985) may harbor novel height alleles independent of previous GWAS-identified variants (r(2) with GWAS loci <0.01); whereas 17q23.3/GH2/rs2006123 was correlated with GWAS-identified variants in European and African populations. Notably, 13q14.2/rs114089985 is infrequent in African Americans (MAF = 3%), extremely rare in European Americans (MAF = 0.03%), and monomorphic in Asian populations, suggesting it may be an African-American-specific height allele.

For amsacrine, similar interspecies pharmacokinetic data were available but toxicity and protein-binding data were available for only 3 species. Significant linear relationships were obtained for CI-921 between log W and log Vss (liters) (r = 0.971, P = 0.006), and log W and log Cl (liters/h) (r = 0.911, P = 0.031) resulting in the allometric equations Vss = 1.22W0.68 and Cl = 0.91W0.51. For amsacrine these corresponding equations were Vss = 3.37W0.81 (r = 0.996, P less than 0.001), and Cl = 2.28W0.46 (r = 0.952, P = 0.012). When interspecies differences in plasma protein binding were taken into account, the allometric relationships improved and the exponents of the power equations increased. For CI-921 the allometric equations for the kinetic parameters calculated from plasma "free" concentrations were: Vssfu (liters) = 247W0.93 (r = 0.984, P = 0.002) and Clu (liters/h) = 186W0.76 (r = 0.961, P = 0.009). The dog was a noticeable outlier in the relationship between the log maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (mg/kg) of CI-921 and log W. Omission of the latter resulted in a highly significant allometric relationship, MTD = 23.6W-0.14 (r = -0.988, P = 0.012). For amsacrine there was no significant allometric relationship between MTD and W. CI-921s prolonged t1/2 in the dog and the dog's increased susceptibility to CI-921 toxicity suggested a relationship between MTD and t1/2 (h). A significant linear relationship was observed between in MTD and t1/2 (r = -0.994, P less than 0.001), from which the following equation was developed MTD = 47.-0.51t1/2 Combining the amsacrine toxicity data in the latter relationship yielded a similar equation MTD = 44.-0.51t1/2 (r = -0.933, P less than 0.0001). It was concluded that allometric equations may be developed for CI-921 and amsacrine from animal pharmacokinetic data which allow a reasonable prediction of Cl and Vss in patients, despite these agents being eliminated mainly by biotransformation. However, similar relationships between toxicity and body weight were susceptible to variation between individual species. Species differences in the toxicity of these agents were predictable from the t1/2. This study emphasized the importance of pharmacokinetic data in preclinical toxicity and efficacy testing of antitumor agents.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26869203>A semi-synthetic natural product blocks collagen induced arthritis by preferentially suppressing the production of IL-6.</a></h2><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune-inflammatory disease is characterized by dysregulation of signal transduction pathways, increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, enhanced leukocyte infiltration into synovial microvascular endothelium, extensive formation of hyper proliferative pannus, degradation of cartilage and bone erosion. Several compounds that abrogate cytokine production demonstrate a therapeutic effect in experimental models of arthritis. In this study, we report that a novel semi-synthetic natural product (Compound A) being a preferential IL-6 inhibitor, is efficacious in a murine model of arthritis. In vitro evaluations of pro-inflammatory cytokine production reveal that Compound A preferentially inhibits induced production of IL-6 and not TNF-α from THP-1 cells and isolated human monocytes. Furthermore, Compound A robustly inhibits the spontaneous production of IL-6 from pathologically relevant synovial tissue cells isolated from patients with active RA. In a physiologically relevant assay, Compound A selectively inhibits the activated T cell contact-mediated production of IL-6 from human monocytes. Compound A, at pharmacologically efficacious concentrations, does not significantly curtail the LPS-induced activation of p38 MAPKs. In the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model (i) macroscopic observations demonstrate that Compound A, administered subcutaneously in a therapeutic regimen, significantly and dose-dependently inhibits disease associated increases in articular index and paw thickness; (ii) histological analyses of paw tissues reveal that Compound A prominently diminishes joint destruction, hyperproliferative pannus formation and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Collectively, these results provide direct evidence that Compound A, a novel preferential IL-6 inhibitor, suppresses collagen-induced arthritis, and may be a potential therapeutic for treating patients with active RA.Copyright © 2016.

A detailed investigation into the generation of these metabolites has been overlooked.We investigated the kinetics of nitrite and S-nitrosothiol-hemoglobin (SNO-Hb) in plasma derived from inhaled NO subjects and how this modifies the cutaneous microvascular response.We enrolled 15 healthy volunteers. Plasma nitrite levels at baseline and during NO inhalation (15 minutes at 40 ppm) were 102 (86-118) and 114 (87-129) nM, respectively. The nitrite peak occurred at  minutes of discontinuing NO (131 (104-170) nM). Plasma nitrate levels were not significantly different during the study. SNO-Hb molar ratio levels at baseline and during NO inhalation were 4.-3 (2.-3-.8E-3) and 7.8E-3 (4.1E-3-13.0E-3), respectively. Levels of SNO-Hb continued to climb up to the last study time point (30 min: 10.6E-3 (.3E-3-15.-3)). The response to acetylcholine iontophoresis both before and during NO inhalation was inversely associated with the SNO-Hb level (r: -0.57, p = 0.03, and r: -0.54, p = 0.04, respectively).Both nitrite and SNO-Hb increase during NO inhalation. Nitrite increases first, followed by a more sustained increase in Hb-SNO. Nitrite and Hb-SNO could be a mobile reservoir of NO with potential implications on the systemic microvasculature.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p></html>
