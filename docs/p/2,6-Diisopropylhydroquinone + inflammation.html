It is common, with an estimated prevalence of around 10% to 20%. Patients experience symptoms of nasal obstruction, anterior rhinorrhoea/post-nasal drip and sneezing. Several subgroups of non-allergic rhinitis can be distinguished, depending on the trigger responsible for symptoms; these include occupation, cigarette smoke, hormones, medication, food and age. On a cellular molecular level different disease mechanisms can also be identified. People with non-allergic rhinitis often lack an effective treatment as a result of poor understanding and lack of recognition of the underlying disease mechanism. Intranasal corticosteroids are one of the most common types of medication prescribed in patients with rhinitis or rhinosinusitis symptoms, including those with non-allergic rhinitis. However, it is unclear whether intranasal corticosteroids are truly effective in these patients.To assess the effects of intranasal corticosteroids in the management of non-allergic rhinitis.The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2019, Issue 7); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 July 2019.Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intranasal corticosteroids, delivered by any means and in any volume, with (a) placebo/no intervention or (b) other active treatments in adults and children (aged ≥ 12 years).We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were patient-reported disease severity and a significant adverse effect - epistaxis. Secondary outcomes were (disease-specific) health-related quality of life, objective measurements of airflow and other adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.We included 34 studies (4452 participants); however, only 13 studies provided data for our main comparison, intranasal corticosteroids versus placebo. The participants were mainly defined as patients with perennial rhinitis symptoms and negative allergy tests. No distinction between different pheno- and endotypes could be made, although a few studies only included a specific phenotype such as pregnancy rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, rhinitis medicamentosa or senile rhinitis. Most studies were conducted in a secondary or tertiary healthcare setting. No studies reported outcomes beyond three months follow-up. Intranasal corticosteroid dosage in the review ranged from 50 µg to 2000 µg daily. Intranasal corticosteroids versus placebo Thirteen studies (2045 participants) provided data for this comparison. These studies used different scoring systems for patient-reported disease severity, so we pooled the data in each analysis using the standardised mean difference (SMD). Intranasal corticosteroid treatment may improve patient-reported disease severity as measured by total nasal symptom score compared with placebo at up to four weeks (SMD -0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.15 to -0.33; 4 studies; 131 participants; I = 22%) (low-certainty evidence). However, between four weeks and three months the evidence is very uncertain (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.20; 3 studies; 85 participants; I = 0%) (very low-certainty evidence). Intranasal corticosteroid treatment may slightly improve patient-reported disease severity as measured by total nasal symptom score change from baseline when compared with placebo at up to four weeks (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.05; 4 studies; 1465 participants; I = 35%) (low-certainty evidence). All four studies evaluating the risk of epistaxis showed that there is probably a higher risk in the intranasal corticosteroids group (65 per 1000) compared to placebo (31 per 1000) (risk ratio (RR) .10, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.57; 4 studies; 1174 participants; I = 0%) (moderate-certainty evidence). The absolute risk difference (RD) was 0.04 with a number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) of 25 (95% CI 16.7 to 100). Only one study reported numerical data for quality of life. It did report a higher quality of life score in the intranasal corticosteroids group (152.3 versus 145.6; SF-12v2 range 0 to 800); however, this disappeared at longer-term follow-up (148.4 versus 145.6) (low-certainty evidence). Only two studies provided data for the outcome objective measurements of airflow. These data could not be pooled because they used different methods of outcome measurement. Neither found a significant difference between the intranasal corticosteroids and placebo group (rhinomanometry SMD -0.46, 95% CI -1.06 to 0.14; 44 participants; peak expiratory flow rate SMD 0.78, 95% CI -0.47 to .03; 11 participants) (very low-certainty evidence). Intranasal corticosteroids probably resulted in little or no difference in the risk of other adverse events compared to placebo (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.12; 3 studies; 1130 participants; I = 0%) (moderate-certainty evidence). Intranasal corticosteroids versus other treatments Only one or a few studies assessed each of the other comparisons (intranasal corticosteroids versus saline irrigation, intranasal antihistamine, capsaicin, cromoglycate sodium, ipratropium bromide, intranasal corticosteroids combined with intranasal antihistamine, intranasal corticosteroids combined with intranasal antihistamine and intranasal corticosteroids with saline compared to saline alone). It is therefore uncertain whether there are differences between intranasal corticosteroids and other active treatments for any of the outcomes reported.Overall, the certainty of the evidence for most outcomes in this review was low or very low. It is unclear whether intranasal corticosteroids reduce patient-reported disease severity in non-allergic rhinitis patients compared with placebo when measured at up to three months. However, intranasal corticosteroids probably have a higher risk of the adverse effect epistaxis. There are very few studies comparing intranasal corticosteroids to other treatment modalities making it difficult to draw conclusions.Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Herein we review advances in the field and highlight therapeutic implications.Pre-clinical and translational human trials have elucidated complement-dependent mechanisms of post-transplant ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Immune cell-derived, and intracellular, complement activation are newly linked to proinflammatory T cell immunity relevant to allograft rejection. Complement-induced immune regulation, including C5a ligation of C5a receptor  on T cells, C5a/C5a receptor 1 interactions on regulatory myeloid cells, and C1q binding to CD8 T cells can inhibit proinflammatory T cells and/or prolong murine allograft survival. Pilot trials of complement inhibition to treat/prevent human I/R- or antibody-initiated allograft injury show promise.The complement system participates in allograft injury through multiple context- dependent mechanisms involving various components and receptors. These new insights along with development and implementation of individualized complement inhibitory strategies have potential to improve transplant outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676701>Acute Calcium Pyrophosphate Crystal Arthritis Flare Rate and Risk Factors for Recurrence.</a></h2><p>Little is known about acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis flare rates and risk factors for recurrence. We characterized flares and determined the rate and predictors of acute CPP crystal arthritis flares in an academic medical center cohort.We performed a retrospective cohort study among a random sample of patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis identified in the Partners HealthCare electronic medical record, 1991- 2017. Flare was defined as self-limited, acute-onset synovitis with synovial fluid calcium pyrophosphate crystals and/or chondrocalcinosis, not better explained by another cause. We calculated incidence rates (IR) for acute CPP crystal arthritis flare among all subjects and by sex. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) for recurrent flare using univariate Cox models that accounted for within-person correlated data.We identified 70 patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis with a total of 111 flares. Recurrent flares occurred in 24% of patients; half of flares occurred in a previously unaffected joint. The acute CPP crystal arthritis flare rate was 11.4 (95% CI 8.-15.4) per 100 person-years overall, 14. (95% CI 9.6-20.1) in women, and 7.1 (95% CI 3.4-13.0) in men. Cancer (HR .98, 95% CI 1.33-6.68) and chronic kidney disease (HR .92, 95% CI 1.10-7.76) were associated with a higher rate for recurrent flare.Recurrent flares occurred in approximately one-fourth of patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis and often occurred in previously unaffected joints. Acute CPP crystal arthritis flare rate was twice as high in women than men.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672639>Effect of Beta-Blockade on the Expression of Regulatory MicroRNA after Severe Trauma and Chronic Stress.</a></h2><p>Beta-blockade administration after lung contusion, hemorrhagic shock, and chronic stress has been shown to improve bone marrow function, decrease hypercatecholaminemia, and reduce . MicroRNAs (miR) are critical biologic regulators that can downregulate gene expression by causing messenger RNA degradation or inhibition of translation. This study sought to expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the reduced inflammatory response after the administration of beta-blockade (BB) in our rodent trauma model.Male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 8 to 9 weeks were randomized to lung contusion, hemorrhagic shock with daily restraint stress (LCHS/CS) or LCHS/CS plus propranolol (LCHS/CS+BB). Restraint stress occurred  hours daily after LCHS. Propranolol (10 mg/kg) was given daily until day 7. Total RNA and miR were isolated from bone marrow and genome-wide miR expression patterns were assayed. Bone marrow cytokine expression was determined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction.LCHS/CS led to significantly increased bone marrow expression of interleukin (IL) 1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, nitric oxide, and plasma C-reactive protein. There were marked differences in expression of 45 miRs in the LCHS/CS+BB group compared with the LCHS/CS group when using a p value <0.001. Rno-miR-27a and miR-25 were upregulated 7- to 8-fold in the rodents who underwent LCHS/CS+BB compared with LCHS/CS alone, and this correlated with reduced bone marrow expression of IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, nitric oxide, and reduced plasma C-reactive protein in the LCHS/CS+BB group.The genomic and miR expression patterns in bone marrow after LCHS/CS differed significantly compared with rodents that received propranolol after LCHS/CS. The use of BB after severe trauma can help mitigate persistent  by upregulating Rno-miR-27a and miR-25 and reducing inflammatory cytokines in those who remain critically ill.Copyright © 2019 American College of Surgeons.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of AGP on feed intake and rectal temperature in sheep. Ewes were ovariectomized, implanted with a cannula into a lateral ventricle of the brain, and kept indoors in individual pens. Feed intake and rectal temperature was determined for sheep in all experiments. In the first experiment, ewes (n = 4) received 1 of 4 treatments [0 (control), 0.012 (low), 0.06 (medium), or 0.30 (high) mg / kg BW AGP] into the lateral ventricle (ICV). All sheep received all treatments in a Latin square design balanced for carryover effects with 10 d between treatments. In the second experiment, ewes (n = 10) received one of two treatments (0 and 3 mg / kg BW of AGP) intravenously (IV) in a completely randomized design. In the third experiment, ewes (n = 19) received peripheral treatments (IV) of an antipyretic [0 (control) or . mg / kg BW flunixin meglumine (FLU)] 30 minutes before receiving central AGP [0 (control) or 0.3 mg / kg BW of AGP] in a completely randomized design. All data were analyzed using a mixed model analysis of variance and tested for effects of treatment, time, and the interaction of treatment and time. Cumulative 48-h feed intake after administration of treatments was also determined. In the first experiment there was no effect of ICV treatment (P = 0.37) on feed intake rate or on cumulative feed intake (P = 0.31). There was an effect of ICV treatment (P = 0.002) on rectal temperatures, which were greater (P < 0.05) after the high dose of centrally administered AGP. In the second experiment there was no effect of AGP administration IV on feed intake rate (P = 0.98), on cumulative feed intake (P = 0.41) or on rectal temperature (P = 0.71). In the third experiment there was an effect of central AGP treatment (P < 0.0001) and an interaction of central AGP and time (P < 0.0001) on rectal temperature, whereas FLU had no effect (P = 0.93), demonstrating that AGP increased rectal temperatures regardless of antipyretic treatment. These results indicate that central AGP increases rectal temperature in sheep by pathways that do not involve prostaglandins. Further research is needed to determine if AGP may be an important integrator of energy balance and .© The Author(s) 2019.

Limited information is available on the impact of the various cART regimens on /immunoactivation. The aim of this work was to explore the impact of elvitegravir, dolutegravir, raltegravir (integrase strand transfer inhibitors, INSTIs) and atazanavir (protease inhibitor, PI) on several soluble markers of immune activation and  during the first year of effective combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART). We conducted an observational retrospective cohort study in HIV-infected cART-naïve patients who initiated an INSTI or atazanavir regimen between March 2015 and February 2016 and a serum sample was available at baseline, 6 and 12 months after initiation. We compared the trend of D-Dimer, TNF- α, IL-, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, CCL4/MIP1-β, CCL5/RANTES, s-CD14, s-CD163, hs-CRP levels among the 4 arms of treatment. Percentage of variation from baseline was also measured for all markers. A total of 36 patients were included. We observed heterogeneous modifications in  markers among arms. In particular, we noted that EVG have significant negative effect on s-CD14, hs-CRP, IL-6 and D-Dimer in respect to other INSTIs and this different effect occurs mainly during the first 6 months of cART. IL-7 values increased in the three arms with INSTIs (significantly only in EGV, 159.8%, p = 0.0003) and decreased significantly in patients on PI (-48.96%; p = 0.04) over the period.

This pilot study investigates whether inflammatory cytokines-interleukins IL-6, -8, -10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-can be used as early biomarkers of radiation-induced adverse health effects in occupationally exposed individuals. The study included 33 workers externally exposed to gamma radiation from the nuclear industry with cumulated doses from 0.11 to 190 mSv and 42 non-exposed controls of comparable age and socio-economic status. IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, TNFα and IL-10 were analyzed by enzyme-linked assay (ELISA) in blood plasma samples. Total antioxidant status (TAS) of blood plasma was determined by a colorimetric assay. The radiation-exposed and control groups measured significantly different levels of MCP-1, TNFα and IL-10. Seventy-five percent of radiation workers had either high MCP-1 levels or low IL-10 levels and 30% had all three cytokines dysregulated. Approximately 50% of workers showed upregulated antioxidant status, which appeared to compensate the pro-inflammatory cytokine shift in these individuals. In contrast, only % of the control subjects were found to have three dysregulated cytokines, and all of them measured within the normal TAS range. The present study may represent an important step towards the establishment of a reliable set of biomarkers for health-risk estimation in population cohorts exposed to low radiation doses.© The Author(s) 2019.

In cancer, epigenetic modifications affect the expression of Enhancer of Zester Homolog  (EZH2), and silenced disabled homolog  interacting protein gene (DAB2IP) (onco-suppressor gene) by Histone H3 tri-methylation in lysine 27 (H3K27me3). In"ex vivo"studies, we assessed EZH2, H3K27me3 and DAB2IP immunoreactivity in bronchial epithelial cells from COPD patients (smokers, ex-smokers), Smoker and control subjects. In"in vitro" experiments we studied the effect of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on EZH2/H3K27me3/DAB2IP expression, apoptosis, invasiveness, and vimentin expression in 16HBE, primary cells, and lung cancer cell lines (A549) long-term exposed to CSE. Finally, in "in vitro"studies, we tested the effect of GSK343 (selective inhibitor of EZH2). EZH2 and H3K27me3 expression was higher, while DAB2IP was lower levels, in bronchial epithelium from COPD and Smokers than in Controls. CSE increased EZH2, H3K27me3 expression and decreased DAB2IP, cell apoptosis and invasiveness in epithelial cells. GSK343 restored the effects of CSE. Cigarette smoke affects EZH2 expression, and reduced DAB2IP via H3K27me3 in COPD patients. The molecular mechanisms associated with EZH2 expression, generate a dysregulation of cell apoptosis, mesenchymal transition, and cell invasiveness in bronchial epithelial cells, encouraging the progression of airway  toward lung cancer in COPD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678301>Associations of Prenatal Dietary Inflammatory Potential with Childhood Respiratory Outcomes in Project Viva.</a></h2><p> during pregnancy may be a factor in the developmental programming of asthma and wheeze in childhood.To examine associations of inflammatory potential of prenatal diet with respiratory outcomes in early and mid-childhood.Among 1,424 mother-child pairs in Project Viva, a pre-birth cohort, we examined associations of Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) (1 trimester,  trimester, and average of 1 and  trimester) scores in relation to: ever asthma and wheezing in the past year (early childhood and mid-childhood); current asthma and lung function (mid-childhood), and wheeze trajectory during 1-9 years. We used multivariable linear and logistic regression modeling, adjusting for relevant confounders.In a fully adjusted analysis, a more pro-inflammatory diet was associated with an early vs. never wheeze trajectory (1 and  trimester average 4 vs. 1 quartile: OR=1.89, 95% CI: 1.14, 3.13). A more pro-inflammatory diet during pregnancy also was associated with lower forced expiratory flow (FEF) in mid-childhood (1 and  trimester average 4 vs. 1 quartile: β -132 ml, 95% CI: -249, -14). Results were evident for 1, but not , trimester DII and wheeze trajectory and mid-childhood FEF. Other child respiratory outcomes, including ever asthma, were not related to any DII measure during pregnancy.Pro-inflammatory diet during pregnancy is associated with wheeze trajectory during early childhood and decrements in small airways caliber in mid-childhood, but not other respiratory outcomes in the offspring.Copyright © 2019.

Although metformin is a well-known antidiabetic drug, it also confers protection against a series of diseases through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However, whether metformin affects PM-induced adverse health effects has not been investigated. In this study, we exposed wild-type (WT) and AMPKα mice to PM every other day via intratracheal instillation for 4 weeks. After PM exposure, the AMPKα mice developed more severe lung injury and cardiac dysfunction than were developed in the WT mice; however the administration of metformin was effective in attenuating PM-induced lung injury and cardiac dysfunction in both the WT and AMPKα mice. In the PM-exposed mice, metformin treatment resulted in reduced systemic and pulmonary , preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, suppressed induction of pulmonary and myocardial fibrosis and oxidative stress, and increased levels of mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, pretreatment with metformin significantly attenuated PM-induced cell death and oxidative stress in control and AMPKα-depleted BEAS-2B and H9C2 cells, and was associated with preserved expression of mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes. These data support the notion that metformin protects against PM-induced adverse health effects through a pathway that appears independent of AMPKα. Our findings suggest that metformin may also be a novel drug for therapies that treat air pollution associated disease.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, systemic administration of CCR2 antagonists is associated with marked increases in CCL2, a CCR2 ligand, in the blood. This heretofore unexplained phenomenon complicates interpretation of in vivo responses to CCR2 antagonism. We report that CCL2 elevation after pharmacological CCR2 blockade is due to interruption in a balance between CCL2 secretion by a variety of cells and its uptake by constitutive internalization and recycling of CCR2. We observed this phenomenon in response to structurally diverse CCR2 antagonists in wild-type mice, and also found substantially higher CCL2 plasma levels in mice lacking the CCR2 gene. Our findings suggest that CCL2 is cleared from blood in a CCR2-dependent but G protein (Gα, Gα or Gα)-independent manner. This constitutive internalization is rapid: on a given monocyte, the entire cell surface CCR2 population is turned over in <30 minutes. We also found that constitutive receptor internalization/recycling and ligand uptake are not universal across monocyte-expressed chemokine receptors. For example, CXCR4 does not internalize constitutively. In summary, we describe a mechanism that explains the numerous preclinical and clinical reports of increased CCL2 plasma levels following in vivo administration of CCR2 antagonists. These findings suggest that constitutive CCL2 secretion by monocytes and other cell types is counteracted by constant uptake and internalization by CCR2-expressing cells. The effectiveness of CCR2 antagonists in disease settings may be dependent upon this critical equilibrium.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668919>Tristetraprolin posttranscriptionally downregulates PFKFB3 in cancer cells.</a></h2><p>The enzyme 6-phosphofructo--kinase/fructose-,6-bisphosphatases 3 (PFKFB3) catalyzes the first committed rate-limiting step of glycolysis and is upregulated in cancer cells. The mechanism of PFKFB3 expression upregulation in cancer cells has not been fully elucidated. The PFKFB3 3'-UTR is reported to contain AU-rich elements (AREs) that are important for regulating PFKFB3 mRNA stability. However, the mechanisms by which PFKFB3 mRNA stability is determined by its 3'-UTR are not well known. We demonstrated that tristetraprolin (TTP), an ARE-binding protein, has a critical function regulating PFKFB3 mRNA stability. Our results showed that PFKFB3 mRNA contains three AREs in the 3'-UTR. TTP bound to the 3rd ARE and enhanced the decay of PFKFB3 mRNA. Overexpression of TTP decreased PFKFB3 expression and ATP levels but increased GSH level in cancer cells. Overexpression of PFKFB3 cDNA without the 3'-UTR rescued ATP level and GSH level in TTP-overexpressing cells. Our results suggested that TTP post-transcriptionally downregulated PFKFB3 expression and that overexpression of TTP may contribute to suppression of glycolysis and energy production of cancer cells in part by downregulating PFKFB3 expression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

They are often characterized by marked genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity, complicating diagnostic work in clinical practice and molecular diagnosis.To develop and evaluate a next-generation sequencing panel targeting genes causing neuroinflammation or mimicking neuroinflammation.Cohort study in which a total of 257 genes associated with monogenic neuroinflammation and/or cerebral vasculopathy, including monogenic noninflammatory diseases mimicking these entities, were selected. A customized enrichment capture array, the neuroinflammation gene panel (NIP), was created. Targeted high-coverage sequencing was applied to DNA samples taken from eligible patients referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, United Kingdom, between January 1, 2017, and January 30, 2019, because of onset of disease early in life, family history, and/or complex neuroinflammatory phenotypes.The main outcome was the percentage of individuals with definitive molecular diagnoses, variant classification, and clinical phenotyping of patients with pathogenic variants identified using the NIP panel. The NIP panel was initially validated in 16 patients with known genetic diagnoses.The NIP was both sensitive (95%) and specific (100%) for detection of known mutations, including gene deletions, copy number variants, small insertions and deletions, and somatic mosaicism with allele fraction as low as 3%. Prospective testing of 60 patients (30 [50%] male; median [range] age, 9.8 [0.8-20] years) presenting with heterogeneous neuroinflammatory phenotypes revealed at least 1 class 5 (clearly pathogenic) variant in 9 of 60 patients (15%); 18 of 60 patients (30%) had at least 1 class 4 (likely pathogenic) variant. Overall, a definitive molecular diagnosis was established in 12 of 60 patients (20%).The NIP was associated with molecular diagnosis in this cohort and complemented routine laboratory and radiological workup of patients with neuroinflammation. Unexpected genotype-phenotype associations in patients with pathogenic variants deviating from the classic phenotype were identified.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifty C57BL/6 mice with caerulein-induced AP were divided into the untreated control group (N=10), the untreated AP model group (N=10), the MaR1-treated (low-dose, 0.1 μg) AP model group (N=10), the MaR1-treated (middle-dose, 0.5 μg) AP model group (N=10), and the MaR1-treated (high-dose, 1 μg) AP model group (N=10). Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) measured serum levels of amylase, lipase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), and IL-6 and mRNA was measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the ratio of reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) were measured. Histology of the pancreas included measurement of acinar cell apoptosis using the terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay. Western blot measured Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), MyD88, and phospho-NF-kappaB p65, and apoptosis-associated proteins Bcl-, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-9. RESULTS Following treatment with MaR1, serum levels of amylase, lipase, TNF-alpha, IL-1ß, and IL-6 decreased, MDA and protein carbonyl levels decreased, SOD and the GSH/GSSG ratio increased in a dose-dependent manner. In the MaR1-treated AP mice,  of the pancreas and the expression of inflammatory cytokines, pancreatic acinar cell apoptosis, Bcl- expression, and expression of TLR4, MyD88, and p-NF-kappaB p65 were reduced, but Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-9 expression increased.

In this article, we review the current state of knowledge and findings of studies investigating the cardiovascular effects of PM in rats and mice. The six main areas covered in this review include: I) nature of particulate matter and toxicity mechanisms, II) systemic , III) heart rate and heart rate variability, IV) histopathological effects, V) atherosclerosis, VI) thrombosis, and VI) myocardial infarction. This review showed that animal model studies have been successful to bring new insights into the mechanisms underlying PM-induced cardiovascular diseases. However, there are some areas that the exact mechanisms are still unclear. In conclusion, investigating the cardiovascular effects of PM in vivo or interpreting the results should attempt to justify the role of different PM compositions, which may vastly affect the overall cytotoxicity of particles.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Cell viability was determined using 3-(4,5- Dimethylthiazol--yl)-,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and the IC50 values of PPIs were measured. The most sensitive cell line A375 was used for further investigation. The cytotoxic effects of LANSO on these cells were assessed using Annexin-V Propidium Iodide (AV-PI) flow cytometry. As of action mechanism; anti-inflammatory effects of each PPIs and PPIs-DOXO combination therapy on LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages were assessed.Dose and time dependence cytotoxic activity of PPIs on human cancer cell lines were founded. Unlike DOXO; All PPIs had a selective cytotoxic effect in the normal fibroblasts. Unlike the equipotent OMP and ESOM; LANSO was the most potent drug with IC50 values at 72h of 99, 217, 272, 208, 181μM against A375, A549, CACO-, MCF-7, and PANC-1, respectively. AV-PI flow cytometry revealed dose-dependent apoptotic effects of LANSO alone and substantially enhanced in DOXO-co-treatments. Interestingly unlike ESOM and OMP, LANSO proved more effective than indomethacin in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. None of the tested compounds, as well as indomethacin, exerted any cytotoxicity against RAW 264.7 macrophages. PPIs-DOXO lacked potential synergistic combination antiinflammation therapies.This study provides evidence that PPIs induce a direct and differential cytotoxic activity against human cancer cell line by the induction of the apoptosis. Moreover, PPIs increases cancer cell lines sensitivity to doxorubicin via apoptosis augmentation. Nevertheless, PPIs-DOXO lacked potential synergistic combination therapies in neither antiproliferation nor anti-.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677385>No Increased Risk of Colorectal Neoplasia in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Postinflammatory Polyps.</a></h2><p>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who have postinflammatory polyps (PIPs) may have an increased risk of developing colorectal neoplasia. Current guidelines recommend an intensified surveillance strategy in these patients, although the evidence for this recommendation is conflicting. The aim of our study was to assess whether IBD patients with PIPs are at increased risk of colorectal neoplasia.We established a retrospective cohort in a tertiary IBD center with IBD patients undergoing colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance in the current era. We compared cumulative incidences of colorectal neoplasia since IBD diagnosis between patients with and without PIPs and corrected for confounders. Second, we compared the risk of receiving a colectomy.In our cohort with >22 years of median follow-up, 154 of 519 patients had PIPs. PIPs were associated with extensive disease (odds ratio [OR], .76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.61-4.42; P < 0.001) and with more severe  at colonoscopy (OR, 3.54; 95% CI, .28-5.50; P < 0.001). After correction for confounders, the presence of PIPs was not associated with development of colorectal neoplasia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.28; 95% CI, 0.85-1.93; P = 0.24) or with development of advanced neoplasia (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.52-3.68; P = 0.52). There was a higher risk of colectomy in patients with PIPs (HR, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.55-7.54; P = 0.002).In this cohort, PIPs were associated with disease extent, , and higher rates of colectomy. However, the presence of PIPs was not associated with the development of neoplasia. These findings suggest that patients with PIPs may not need an intensified surveillance strategy.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Prednisolone acetate and difluprednate are the two main products for this purpose. However, it is unclear which one should be used in terms of effectiveness and safety.Systematic review and meta-analysis.Medline via PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of science and clinicaltrials.gov were searched through 10 January 2018, and updated on 20 July 2019, in addition to researching the references' lists of the relevant articles.Randomised-controlled trials (RCTs) comparing difluprednate and prednisolone acetate regardless of the dosing regimen used.Two independent authors assessed the included RCTs regarding the risk of bias using the Cochrane tool. Relevant data were extracted, and meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used to appraise the evidence quality.We included six RCTs with 883 patients: 441 received difluprednate and 442 received prednisolone acetate. The evidence quality was graded as moderate for corneal oedema and intraocular pressure and low for anterior chamber (AC) clearance. After small incision cataract surgery, difluprednate was superior in clearing AC cells at 1 week (OR=.5, p>0.00001) and at  weeks (OR=.5, p=0.04), as well as clearing the AC flare at  weeks (OR=6.7, p=0.04). After phacoemulsification, difluprednate was superior in terms of corneal clarity at 1 day (OR=.6, p=0.02) and 1 week after surgery (OR=1.96, p=0.0007). No statistically significant difference was detected between both agents at 1 month in effectiveness. Also, both agents were safe, evaluated by the ocular hypertension (OR=1.23, p=0.8).With low-to-moderate certainty, difluprednate and prednisolone acetate are safe agents for controlling the  after cataract surgery. Difluprednate showed significant superiority in terms of AC cells and AC flare at  weeks postoperatively.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of GnRH analog (GnRHa) and GnRHa plus recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment on final height in healthy girls with EP.Fifty EP girls (sexual maturity rating: -3) with chronological age (CA) 9.22 ± 0.56 and bone age (BA) 9.74 ± 0.59 years were treated with GnRHa (Triptorelin) at a dose of 100 μg/kg body weight (BW) as intramuscular every 28 days for .82 ± 0.57 years; 45 EP girls with CA 9.84 ± 0.57 and BA 10.14 ± 1.02 years were also treated with the same GnRHa plus rhGH (Norditropin) at a dose of 0.1 unit/kg BW daily for 6 days in a week for .55 ± 0.6 years. In the control group, 33 EP girls followed for the same period without treatment. Height, weight, and body mass index of girls and parents were assessed. Predicted adult height (PAH) at the start and the end of the study and target height were assessed.PAH at the end of the study in the GnRHa group was not different with untreated girls. PAH at the end of the treatment in GnRHa plus rhGH group was significantly higher than both untreated and GnRHa group. PAH at the end of therapy in GnRHa plus rhGH group was significantly more than their target height.GnRHa therapy has a benefit effect in achievement of target height. Combination therapy with GnRHa plus rhGH increased their PAH more than both untreated and GnRHa groups.Copyright: © 2019 Advanced Biomedical Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675169>Factors Predictive of Radiographic Progression in Ankylosing Spondylitis.</a></h2><p>Using a longitudinal observational cohort of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients, we sought to identify progression rates, and factors predictive of spinal progression. As a secondary aim we analyzed the effect of tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) treatment on radiographic progression.AS patients who had baseline and follow-up cervical and lumbar X-rays were included in the study. Radiographic damage was assessed by the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spinal Score (mSASSS). A change of  mSASSS units in  years was defined as progression. The characteristics of the study group such as demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment history were collected.There were 350 patients in the study. The mean mSASSS increased from 9.3 (15.8) units at baseline to 17.7 (21.7) units by the 6th year. Change in mSASSS scores between the 0 to ,  to 4 and 4 to 6 years were 1.23 (.68), 1.47 (.86), and 1.52 (3.7) units respectively. Overall 24.3% of the group progressed in  years' time. Male sex (HR .46, 95%CI 1.05, 5.76), presence of baseline damage (HR 7.98, 95%CI 3.98, 16), increased inflammatory markers (logCRP; HR 1.35, 95%CI 1.07, 1.70) and TNFi use (HR 0.82, 95%CI 0.70, 0.96) were predictive of radiographic progression. There was a 20% reduction in the rate of progression with TNFi.Male sex, presence of baseline damage, active disease state and higher inflammatory markers confer a high-risk group for disease progression. Treatment with TNFi showed a disease modifying effect by slowing the rate of radiographic progression.© 2019, American College of Rheumatology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669540>15-Keto prostaglandin E induces heme oxygenase-1 expression through activation of Nrf2 in human colon epithelial CCD 841 CoN cells.</a></h2><p>Prostaglandin E (PGE) plays a key role in -associated carcinogenesis. NAD-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) catalyzes the oxidation of the 15(S)-hydroxyl group of PGE to generate 15-keto PGE. 15-PGDH has been known as a tumor suppressor in various malignancies including colon cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumor-suppressive function of 15-PGDH remain largely unresolved. In this study, we found that 15-keto PGE upregulated the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a representative antioxidative and anti-inflammatory enzyme, at both transcriptional and translational levels in human colon epithelial CCD 841 CoN cells. A redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) plays a critical role in the regulation of HO-1 and other cytoprotective proteins. 15-Keto PGE induced translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus and antioxidant response element-driven luciferase activity. Furthermore, the silencing of the Nrf2 gene abolished 15-keto PGE-induced HO-1 expression in CCD 841 CoN cells. 15-Keto PGE activated AKT signaling, and the pharmacological AKT inhibitor, LY294002 suppressed the 15-keto PGE-induced HO-1 expression. 15-Keto PGE generates the reactive oxygen species which is suppressed by the general antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine. N-acetyl-l-cysteine treatment attenuated the 15-keto PGE-induced phosphorylation of GSK3β, transcriptional activity of Nrf2, and subsequently HO-1 expression. However, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE lacking the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety failed to induce reactive oxygen species, HO-1 expression and nuclear translocation of Nrf2. In conclusion, 15-keto PGE induces HO-1 expression through Nrf2 activation in human colon epithelial cells.Copyright © 2019.

A formulation containing 1% Naltrexone HCl in XemaTop™ base was compounded, characterized and evaluated in vitro as a possible treatment for psoriasis. A three-dimensional psoriasis tissue model was exposed to the formulation for  or 5 days and analyzed for the level of markers of cellular proliferation, and inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Using immunohistochemical staining, the level of Ki67 protein significantly decreased in the drug-treated tissues. Western blot analysis showed 86% and 53% down-regulation of other proliferation markers PCNA and CYCLIN D1, respectively, after 5-day exposure. The pro-survival Wnt/β-catenin pathway was compromised as indicated by 57% decrease in the level of β-CATENIN and down-regulation of its down-stream targets including CYCLIN D1 (decreased by 53%), c-MYC (63%), c-JUN (92%) and MET (96%) proteins. Likewise, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was significantly inhibited by 1% Naltrexone HCl in XemaTop™, suggesting protein synthesis was affected. The production of IL-6 was inhibited by 70% in drug-treated tissues. These results suggest that the compounded drug is efficacious in down-regulating molecular markers associated with the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Low-dose Naltrexone in XemaTop™ was stable within 180 days when stored under refrigerated or ambient conditions. These results provide a basis for a clinical evaluation of 1% Naltrexone HCl in XemaTop™ in psoriasis patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679791></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666841>Predictive Value of Hematologic Indices in the Diagnosis of Acute Coronary Syndrome.</a></h2><p>Distinguishing between Acute Coronary Syndrom (ACS) and SCAD (Stable Coronary Artery Disease) requires advanced laboratory instrument and electrocardiogram.

A µm scale signaling assembly, the central supramolecular signaling cluster (cSMAC), forms at the center of the interface of T cells activated by antigen-presenting cells. We have determined that it is composed of multiple complexes of a supramolecular volume of up to 0.5 µm and associated with extensive membrane undulations. To determine cSMAC function, we have systematically manipulated the localization of three adaptor proteins, LAT, SLP-76, and Grb2. cSMAC localization varied between the adaptors and was diminished upon blockade of the costimulatory receptor CD28 and deficiency of the signal amplifying kinase Itk. Reconstitution of cSMAC localization restored IL- secretion which is a key T cell effector function as dependent on reconstitution dynamics. Our data suggest that the cSMAC enhances early signaling by facilitating signaling interactions and attenuates signaling thereafter through sequestration of a more limited set of signaling intermediates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668529>Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders in South of Tunisia: A rare entity with low seroprevalence of anti-aquaporin 4 autoantibodies.</a></h2><p>Screening for anti-aquaporin 4 (anti-AQP4) antibodies, a specific marker of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), is part of the immunological investigation performed in a context of central nervous system (CNS)  with optic neuritis and/or myelitis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence and the diagnostic value of anti-AQP4 antibodies in Tunisian patients with such inflammatory neurological conditions.During 3years, 170 consecutive serum samples of Tunisian patients with CNS inflammatory disorders and optico-spinal involvement were tested in our laboratory for anti-AQP4 antibodies using indirect immunofluorescence on transfected cells.The global seroprevalence of anti-AQP4 in our study was 4.1% (7 cases/170). The diagnosis of NMOSD was made for the 7 seropositive patients and for  seronegative patients, which leads to a seroprevalence of 77.7% in our NMOSD subgroup. The detection of anti-AQP4 allowed the diagnosis of NMOSD in 4 patients with incomplete clinical presentation and 5 patients with positive antinuclear antibodies. In one case, seropositivity was detected in a second sample, one year after an initial seronegativity.NMOSD seem to represent a rare etiology of optic neuritis and/or myelitis in Tunisian patients. Despite its low global seroprevalence in our study population, anti-AQP4 appears to be a very clinically relevant marker for NMOSD diagnosis.

Work related rhinitis was more common in acrylate than isocyanate-induced asthma (p<0.001). The increase in post-challenge fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) was significantly greater in acrylate-induced OA (26.0, 8.-38.0 ppb) than in OA induced by other LMW agents (3.0, -1.0-10.0 ppb, p<0.001) or isocyanates (5.0, .0-16.0 ppb, p=0.010). Multivariable models confirmed that OA induced by acrylates was significantly and independently associated with a post-challenge increase in FeNO (≥17.5 ppb).Acrylate-induced OA shows specific characteristics, concomitant work-related rhinitis and exposure-related increases in FeNO, suggesting that acrylates may induce asthma through different immunological mechanisms than other LMW agents.

Pulmonary manifestations of IgG4-RD include pulmonary solid nodules, thickening of bronchovascular bundles, interstitial involvement, and ground glass opacities. Here we present a rare case of IgG4-RD with tracheobronchial nodules and review the relevant literature.A 52-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a history of intermittent cough for 27 months and recurrent wheezing for 17 months. He had been diagnosed with asthma prior to admission and was responsive to oral prednisone (30 mg/day, with gradual tapering). Bronchoscopy performed  years prior to admission showed tracheal and bronchial mucosal hyperemia, edema, and miliary nodules. Pathological tests showed chronic  with focal lymphocytic infiltration in the bronchial mucosa. The patient had recurrent cough and wheezing after prednisone was stopped or the dose reduced. At the time of admission to our hospital, his serum immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) level had increased to 7.35 g/L. Following bronchoscopy, the IgG4 expression in the bronchial mucosa was compared with that observed during the last two bronchoscopies. Bronchoscopy performed 7 months prior to admission revealed IgG4+ plasma cell infiltration in the bronchial tissue, with > 10 IgG4+ plasma cells per high power field and an IgG4+/IgG+ cell ratio of > 40%. The current bronchoscopy revealed a decrease in IgG4 expression in the bronchial tissue, probably because of the intermittent prednisone treatment. The case fulfilled the comprehensive clinical diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD. He received prednisone and azathioprine, and he has never developed recurrence.Our case exhibited three important clinical indication: First, tracheobronchial miliary nodules could be the presentation of IgG4-related disease. Second, IgG4-related disease with pulmonary involvement has close connection with asthma. Last, IgG4-related disease can be very sensitive to prednisone, the infiltration of IgG4 positive plasma cells decreased after prednisone treatment and symptoms significantly improved in our case. In conclusion, we reported the first case of IgG4-RD presenting with miliary nodules on the tracheal and bronchial tube walls combined with asthma.

Mammals have only one member, TRPA1, which is widely expressed in sensory neurons and in non-neuronal cells (such as epithelial cells and hair cells). TRPA1 owes its name to the presence of 14 ankyrin repeats located in the N-terminus of the channel, an unusual structural feature that may be relevant to its interactions with intracellular components. TRPA1 is primarily involved in the detection of an extremely wide variety of exogenous stimuli that may produce cellular damage. This include a plethora of electrophilic compounds that interact with nucleophilic amino acid residues in the channel, and many other chemically-unrelated compounds whose only common feature seems to be their ability to partition in the plasma membrane. TRPA1 has been reported to be activated by cold, heat and mechanical stimuli, and its function is modulated by multiple factors, including Ca, trace metals, pH, and reactive oxygen, nitrogen and carbonyl species. TRPA1 is involved in acute and chronic pain, , plays a role in the pathophysiology of nearly all organ systems and is an attractive target for the treatment of related diseases.

Moreover, treatment of Mtb-infected marmosets with a cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase inhibitor controls disease progression and reduces lesion-associated , but most lesions become cavitary. Deletion of both NDH- encoding genes (Δndh- mutant) reveals that the essentiality of NDH- as shown in standard growth media is due to the presence of fatty acids. The Δndh- mutant is only mildly attenuated in mice and not differently susceptible to clofazimine, a drug in clinical use proposed to engage NDH-.

Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the role and the underlying mechanism of Wnt5a/receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor  (Ror2) pathways in the promotion of AS process through affecting lipid accumulation and . In atherosclerotic clinical samples, Wnt5a levels were measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. In vivo experiments were conducted by using apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE) mice model. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were applied for in vitro studies. Wnt5a was highly expressed in both of atherosclerotic clinical samples and apoE mice. The knockdown of Wnt5a significantly inhibited cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory response. Additionally, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced  aggravated the cholesterol accumulation and decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression in VSMCs. Depletion of intracellular cholesterol by β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) led to the upregulation of ABCA1 and the inhibition of . Conversely, the overexpression of Wnt5a inhibited ABCA1 expression, facilitated cholesterol accumulation, impared cholesterol efflux, promoted NF-κB nuclear translocation and the inflammatory cytokines secretion. Moreover, the knockdown of Ror2 increased ABCA1 expression and reduced Wnt5a-induced cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, the knockdown of ABCA1 enhanced cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory response. Therefore, Wnt5a/Ror2 pathway was critical in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and inflammatory response, which might be a promising therapeutic target for AS therapy.Copyright © 2019.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy that has led to many cancer-related deaths. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic aspect of Treg cells in CRC patients. Data showed that tumor-infiltrating FOXP3 Treg cells expressed granzyme B immediately following resection, indicating that granzyme B-expressing Treg cells were present directly ex vivo. In the tumor-associated lymph nodes (LNs) and circulating lymphocytes, however, granzyme B-expressing Treg cells were only scarcely found. We then attempted to stimulate granzyme B expression in circulating Treg cells. Granzyme B upregulation in Treg cells could not be activated by standard T cell receptor (TCR) activation through anti-CD3/CD28 and IL- but required stimulation with bacterial products, such as with heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus. Interestingly, granzyme B expression was highly concentrated in TIM-3 Treg cells, a Treg subset previously shown to be enriched in the tumor microenvironment and presented increased suppressive capacity. These TIM-3 Treg cells presented higher cytolytic capacity toward autologous T conventional cells than the TIM-3- Treg cells, in a manner that was dependent on granzyme B but not TIM-3. Overall, we found that granzyme B-expressing Treg cells were enriched in the tumors from CRC patients and had the potential to eliminate autologous T conventional cells.Copyright © 2019.

Hence, PVA/PEI solutions were electrospun at different PVA/PEI mass ratios of 100/0, 85/15, 75/25, and 65/35. SEM observations illustrated the diameters of 125-161 nm for collected fibers. FTIR and DSC characterizations were utilized to examine microstructural changes of fibers. In-vitro drug release revealed that the amount of drug loaded in PVA/PEI fibers increased by enhancing PEI content due to abundant amine terminated groups as well as hollow interior between branches. The maximum concentration of released drug equal to 130.69 mg/L was achieved for PVA/PEI (75/25) fibers which is about .5 times higher than drug-loaded PVA fibers. An increase of 34% in drug release characteristic of fibrous structure comparing to as-cast film was also obtained at 24 h of immersion time. The decreased release rate of ibuprofen was shown for drug-loaded PVA and PVA/PEI fibers heat-treated at 140 °C and 120 °C, respectively. By assessing drug release mechanism through so-called Peppas kinetic model, it was found that heat treatment changed release mechanism from swelling-controlled to diffusion-controlled for drug-loaded PVA/PEI fibers. Overall, ibuprofen-loaded PVA/PEI fibrous membrane presents a substantial potential for drug delivery systems with anti- and analgesic-eluting applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675385>Urinary tract infection, , and cognition in phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness Study.</a></h2><p>Schizophrenia is associated with an increased prevalence of infections throughout the life span. Previous studies have found an association between urinary tract infection (UTI) and acute psychosis. We investigated the prevalence and correlates of UTI in a large cohort of patients with schizophrenia.We estimated the prevalence of UTI at the baseline visit of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) schizophrenia trial. We then investigated associations between UTI and inflammatory markers, psychopathology, and cognition, controlling for potential confounding factors.The prevalence of probable UTI at baseline in the CATIE trial was 1.% (n = 13 of 1,061 participants). Compared with participants with a normal urinalysis (n = 387), after controlling for potential confounders, UTI was a significant predictor of greater impairments (approximately 1 standard deviation difference) in the cognition composite score (beta = -0.153, P = .002), and poorer working memory (beta = -0.190, P < .001). There were no differences in psychopathology scores between participants with probable UTI and those with a normal urinalysis.Urinary tract infections in patients with schizophrenia may have an impact on cognition.

CRP has been found to be elevated in patients with mood disorders (especially unipolar disorders (UD) and in schizophrenia (SZ)) but also to be lowered by antidepressants.The objectives were (i) to determine the prevalence of major depression, antidepressant prescription and remission under antidepressant in a stabilized population of SZ and UD patients consulting in a daily hospital, and (ii) to determine if CRP was a marker of major depression and remission under antidepressant in these SZ and UD populations.Abnormal CRP was defined by a CRP blood level ≥ 3 mg/L. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Calgary Depression Rating Scale score. The clinicians were blinded of the CRP status of the patient.411 patients were included (272 SZ and 139 UD). 171 (41.6%) were diagnosed with current major depression (74 (27.%) for SZ and 97 (69.8%) for UD). 86 SZ (31.6%) and 119 UD (85.6%) were treated by antidepressant. Only 28/74 (37.8%) of the SZ subjects with major depression were administered antidepressants vs. 87/97 (89.7%) for UD. The non-remission rate under antidepressant was 28/86(32.6%) for SZ and 87/119 (73.1%) for UD. Overall, 105 (40.1%) of SZ and 39 (28.1%) of UD patients were found to have abnormal CRP blood levels. Abnormal CRP levels were significantly associated with increased MDD and more strongly with increased rates of non-remission under antidepressants in SZ patients, independently of age, gender, psychotic symptomatology, functioning, tobacco smoking and metabolic syndrome. This result was not replicated in UD patients, which suggests that CRP may be a specific marker of major depression and remission under antidepressant in SZ patients.The development of biomarkers in psychiatry may orientate specific etiologic therapies in patients with mental disorders. The present findings suggest that major depression is frequent in SZ patients and that increased CRP levels are associated with non-remission under antidepressants in this population. Anti-inflammatory strategies may be particularly useful in this specific population.Copyright © 2018.

Increased sympathetic drive is a hallmark of HF and is associated with disease progression and higher mortality risk. Several mechanisms contribute to enhanced sympathetic activity in HF, however these pathways are still incompletely understood. Previous work suggests that  and activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) increases sympathetic drive. Importantly, chronic  in several brain regions is commonly observed in aged populations, and a growing body of evidence suggests neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in HF. In animal models of HF, central inhibition of RAS and pro-inflammatory cytokines normalizes sympathetic drive and improves cardiac function. The precise molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to neuroinflammation and its effect on HF progression remain undetermined. This review will summarize the most recent advances in the field of neuroinflammation and autonomic control in HF. In addition, we will focus on cellular and molecular mediators of neuroinflammation in HF with a focus on brain regions involved in sympathetic control. Finally, we will comment on what is known about neuroinflammation in the context of preserved vs. reduced ejection fraction HF. Integrative physiology of heart failure progression: Heart failure (HF) is characterized by chronic , Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) overactivity, sympathoexcitation, and cardiac dysfunction. Sympathoexcitation and RAS activation occur early in HF progression as a compensatory response to hemodynamic challenges. Chronic activation of these compensatory mechanisms becomes maladaptive and has toxic effects on cardiac muscle leading to electrophysiological abnormalities and initiation of fibrotic processes. RAS activation also enhances chemoreflex sensitivity (further exacerbating sympathetic activation) and promotes diffuse . Both systemic and brain RAS and  feeds back to exacerbate sympathoexcitation, generating a vicious cycle that contributes to further cardiac dysfunction. This article is protected by copyright.

There are few reports on how VB6 mediates weaned piglet intestinal health. This study purposed to investigate dietary VB6 effects on growth, diarrhea rates, and intestinal morphology and function in weaned piglets fed a high-crude protein (22% CP) diet. Eighteen 21-day old weaned [(Yorkshire × Landrace) × Duroc] piglets with body weights of 7.03 ± 0.15 (means ± SEM) kg were randomly assigned into 3 VB6-containing dietary treatments. Vitamin B6 content was: 0 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, and 7 mg/kg respectively. The feeding period lasted 14 days. The results showed that no siginificant difference existed for the growth performance. The 7 mg/kg VB6 group had a tendency to decrease diarrhea rate (P = 0.065). Blood biochemical parameters analysis demonstrated that total protein, cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein significantly increased in the 7 mg/kg VB6 group (P < 0.05). In the jejunum, no significant differences were detected for villus height, villus width, crypt depth, villus height and crypt depth ratios, and positive Ki67 counts and the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines. Vitamin B6 significantly increased the mRNA expression of SLC6A19 and SLC6A20 (P < 0.05) and decreased mRNA expression of SLC36A1 (P < 0.05). In the ileum, VB6 significantly increased villus height and villus width (P < 0.05) while decreased positive Ki67 cell counts for 7 mg/kg VB6 group (P < 0.05). Vitamin B6 had significantly increased the mRNA expression of IL-1β, TNF-α，COX- and TGF-β (P < 0.05). Vitamin B6 also had significantly increased mRNA expression of SLC6A19，SLC7A6, SLC7A7 and SLC36A1 (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that dietary supplementation with VB6 may affect the intestinal morphology and absorption and metabolism of protein in weaned piglets fed a high-protein diet by altering the expression of intestinal inflammatory cytokines and amino acid transporters.© The Author(s) 2019.

We have recently shown 30-d exposure to increased inspired CO (InCO) leads to a steady-state ventilation that exceeds the level predicted by the sustained acidosis and the acute CO/H chemoreflex, suggesting plasticity within respiratory control centers. Based on data showing brainstem changes in aminergic and inflammatory signaling during carotid body denervation-induced hypercapnia, we hypothesized chronic hypercapnia  will lead to similar changes. We found that: ) increased InCO increased IL-1β in the medullary raphe (MR), ventral respiratory column, and cuneate nucleus after 24 h, but not after 30 d of hypercapnia; ) the number of serotonergic and total neurons were reduced within the MR and ventrolateral medulla following 30 d of increased InCO; ) markers of tryptophan metabolism were altered following 24 h, but not 30 d of InCO; and ) there were few changes in brainstem amine levels following 24 h or 30 d of increased InCO. We conclude that these changes may contribute to initiating or maintaining respiratory neuroplasticity during chronic hypercapnia but alone do not account for ventilatory acclimatization to chronic increased InCO.-Burgraff, N.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the relationship between chronic exposure to Pb and oral anti-inflammatory potential of preschool children. For this analysis, 574 preschool children from .5 to 6 years of age were recruited between November and December 2017, in which 357 preschool children were from Guiyu (n = 357), an e-waste-contaminated town, and 217 from Haojiang Shantou. We measured the levels of child blood Pb, salivary sialic acid, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and investigated the prevalence of dental caries in deciduous teeth. The medians of blood Pb levels, serum IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly higher in the Guiyu children than in Haojiang children. Concomitantly, salivary sialic acids were lower in the Guiyu children [9.58 (3.97, 18.42) mg/dL] than in Haojiang [17.57 (5.95, 24.23) mg/dL]. Additionally, the prevalence of dental caries in deciduous teeth was significantly higher in the Guiyu children than in Haojiang (62.5% vs. 53.9%). Blood Pb levels were negatively correlated with salivary sialic acids, in which IL-6 played as a mediator of the association between blood Pb levels and saliva sialic acid concentrations according to the mediation model. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the potential association between chronic Pb exposure and the anti-inflammatory ability of oral sialic acids among preschool children. These results suggest that the chronic Pb exposure can reduce salivary sialic acid levels, attenuate oral anti-inflammatory potential and increase the potential risk of dental caries in deciduous teeth among preschool children in an e-waste site.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The identification of compounds that trigger the immunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependent allergic reaction remain the means to improve the quality of life by limiting patient's exposure to critical allergens. Information concerning the treatment and onset of allergic disorders including atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and bronchial asthma has been provided by the research over the past decade. Recent studies also indicated that allergic  is associated closely with their exacerbation and progression and indeed is the basic pathophysiology of allergic diseases. As a result of immunological and molecular biological studies our understanding of the mechanism of allergic  with regard to therapeutic agents has improved. While much effort has been paid to developing a new anti-allergic agent, the allergic disease has yet to be completely conquered. The more extensive research will allow the development of new therapeutics to combat allergic diseases. Currently, with respect to mechanism of action anti-allergy drugs are classified into five types including histamine H antagonists, leukotriene antagonists, Th cytokine inhibitors, thromboxane A inhibitors and mediator-release inhibitors. The use of two or more anti-allergy agents together is not acknowledged at present, but this will be the subject of research in the future because with different mechanisms of action anti-allergy agents used at the same time will theoretically increase their effects. This review article focuses on anti-allergy agents highlighting their applications, clinical trials and recent advancement on drugs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Free radicals mediated oxidative stress is a critical player in HC-associated pathophysiological insults including atherosclerosis. Unwanted side effects associated with statins, COX- inhibitors, and other synthetic drugs limit their use. Thus, modulation of oxidative stress during HC using green pharmaceuticals seems an appropriate approach against deleterious CV consequences without noticeable side-effect. In this regard, owing to an abundance of proteins, fiber and optimal ratios of omega 6 PUFA: omega-3 PUFA in Hempseed (HS), we aim to exploit its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties to ameliorate HC- associated CV effects.Comparing the antioxidant capacity of protein and lipid fractions of HS using ABTS and DPPH assays, HS was supplemented to high-fat diets (HFD) induced hypercholesterolemic wistar rats. After treatment schedules, lipid profiles, histological and ultrastructural investigations, gene and protein expressions of inflammatory markers, markers of oxidative stress were studied and correlated with biophysical parameters such as ECG and impedance/conductance across the aorta. HS demonstrating in vitro free radical scavenging activity, ameliorated the signs of HC as seen with improved lipid profiles, aortic tissue damage and ECG patterns compared to HFD groups. HS administration also relieved the COX- mediated , which correlated well with the improved redox status in the tissue.Current study evidently demonstrates that the anti-hypercholesterolemic effects of HS are mediated through redox-sensitive modulation of inflammatory pathways.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

PI was limited to the small bowel in 5 patients, the right colon in 5, and small bowel and colonic in 1. All 3 mortalities had CD, small intestinal PI and portal/mesenteric venous gas. The systematic literature search identified 9 articles describing 58 patients with IBD and PI. These cases were mostly included in larger cohorts of PI patients without extractable data on presentation or outcomes in the IBD subpopulation.Ours appears to be the first reporting of presentations and outcomes, outside of case reports, for those with PI and IBD.

Selenium is a nutritionally essential trace metalloid well documented to elicit compelling pharmacological activities in vitro and in vivo. Report on the influence of selenium on arsenic-mediated behavioral derangement is lacking in literature. Hence, to fill this knowledge gap, rats were either exposed to arsenic per se in drinking water at 60 µg AsONa/L or co-administered with inorganic selenium at 0.25 mg/kg or organic selenium diphenyl diselenide (DPDS) at .5 mg/kg body weight for 45 successive days. Neurobehavioural data from rats in a new environment using video-tracking software evinced that inorganic and organic forms of selenium significantly (p < 0.05) abrogated arsenic-induced motor and locomotor insufficiencies such as increased negative geotaxis and fecal pellets numbers as well as the diminution in grip strength, body rotation, maximum speed, absolute turn angle and total distance travelled. The augmentation in the behavioral activities in rats co-administered with arsenic and both forms of selenium was substantiated using track and occupancy plots analyses. Selenium mitigated arsenic-induced decreases in glutathione level and acetylcholinesterase activity as well as the increase in oxidative stress and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Moreover, selenium diminished inflammatory parameters (myeloperoxidase activity, nitric oxide, tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1 beta levels), caspase-3 activity and ameliorated histological lesions in the cerebellum, cerebrum and liver of the rats. Collectively, selenium abated arsenic-induced behavioral derangements via anti-, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic mechanisms in rats.Copyright © 2019.

All patients were treated with the same -week course of prednisolone acetate 1% drops four times per day. The clinical parameters evaluated were surface dimensions determined by slitlamp biomicroscopy, cross-sectional dimensions determined by AS-OCT, and symptom scores determined by patient surveys. Pretreatment and 1-month posttreatment values were compared with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Patients were followed up to 1 year after treatment.Twenty-two eyes from 22 patients (4 men and 18 women) with an average age of 37.7±8.8 (range, 27-57) years and an average duration of symptoms of 22 (range, 5-60) days were included.

We evaluated their correlations with the post-surgical long-term outcomes of patients with mass-forming (MF) intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).The subjects of this study were 52 patients who underwent hepatic resection for MF-ICC at our hospital. We measured the cutoff values of NLR, LMR and PLR, using receiver operating characteristic curves, and compared the survival rates of patients with high vs. those with low values. We also evaluated a prognostic scoring system based on significant inflammatory biomarkers.The cutoff values for NLR, LMR, and PLR were 1.93, 4.78, and 98, respectively. The high-NLR and low-LMR groups had significantly worse prognoses than the low-NLR and high-LMR groups. We designed a scoring system using the  score (IS) based on NLR and LMR values, stratifying patients into three groups with scores of 0, 1, or . The IS was significantly correlated with overall survival (OS), with 5-year survival rates by the IS score of 100% for 0, 61% for 1, and 32% for  (P = 0.011). The IS was found to be an independent predictor of OS in multivariate analysis.Our IS scoring system may predict long-term outcomes after surgery for MF-ICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677037>Isoquercetin regulates SREBP-1C via AMPK pathway in skeletal muscle to exert antihyperlipidemic and anti-inflammatory effects in STZ induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a cluster of metabolic diseases that exhibits high blood glucose levels accompanied by hyperlipidemia and . DM is the primary risk factor contributes majorly to cardiovascular disease (CVD) mediated morbidity and mortality. The incidence of dyslipidemia seems to attribute considerably to the initiation of CVDs. The beneficial action of isoquercetin on hyperlipidemia and related signaling pathways are not documented yet, hence we decide to carry out this study. The experimental rats were divided into five groups: Group 1, control rats; group , isoquercetin control (40 mg/kg b.w); group 3, diabetic rats (STZ-40 mg/kg b.w); group 4, diabetic + isoquercetin (40 mg/kg b.w); and group 5, diabetic + glibenclamide (600 µg/kg b.w). The animals were sacrificed at the end of the experimental duration of 45 days. Results of our analysis reveal that isoquercetin have a major impact on the tissue lipid profile, isoquercetin strongly regulates the expression of various lipid-metabolizing enzymes, C-reactive protein, expression of various inflammatory genes, SREBP-1C genes and proteins and AMP-activated protein kinase-α (AMPK) signaling pathway genes and proteins. Results recommend that isoquercetin can be effective in mitigating the consequences of hyperlipidemia and DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677553>(-)-Epicatechin and NADPH oxidase inhibitors prevent bile acid-induced Caco- monolayer permeabilization through ERK1/ modulation.</a></h2><p>Secondary bile acids promote gastrointestinal (GI) tract permeabilization both in vivo and in vitro. Consumption of high fat diets increases bile acid levels in the GI tract which can contribute to intestinal permeabilization and consequent local and systemic . This work investigated the mechanisms involved in bile acid (deoxycholic acid (DCA))-induced intestinal epithelial cell monolayer permeabilization and the preventive capacity of (-)-epicatechin (EC). While EC prevented high fat diet-induced intestinal permeabilization in mice, it did not mitigate the associated increase in fecal/cecal total and individual bile acids. In vitro, using differentiated Caco- cells as a model of epithelial barrier, EC and other NADPH oxidase inhibitors (VAS-2870 and apocynin) mitigated DCA-induced Caco- monolayer permeabilization. While EC inhibited DCA-mediated increase in cell oxidants, it did not prevent DCA-induced mitochondrial oxidant production. Prevention of DCA-induced ERK1/ activation with EC, VAS-2870, apocynin and the MEK inhibitor U0126, also prevented monolayer permeabilization, stressing the key involvement of ERK1/ in this process and its redox regulation. Downstream, DCA promoted myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation which was related to MLC phosphatase (MLCP) inhibition by ERK1/. DCA also decreased the levels of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin, which can be related to MMP- activation and consequent ZO-1 and occludin degradation. Both events were prevented by EC, NADPH oxidase and ERK1/ inhibitors. Thus, DCA-induced Caco- monolayer permeabilization occurs mainly secondary to a redox-regulated ERK1/ activation and downstream disruption of TJ structure and dynamic. EC's capacity to mitigate in vivo the gastrointestinal permeabilization caused by consumption of high-fat diets can be in part related to its capacity to inhibit bile-induced NADPH oxidase and ERK1/ activation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

This study aimed to study the influence of dexmedetomidine (Dex) on NPP. Chronic constriction injury (CCI) was operated to form the NPP rat model. The OX42 and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the nerve growth factors (NGFs), and the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) proteins were separately detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or Western blot. Inflammatory factors were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results demonstrated that Dex obviously alleviated CCI-stimulated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Meanwhile, the expressions of interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, chemokine c-X3-c-motif ligand 1, and C-C motif chemokine ligand  were greatly increased in CCI rats, but these effects were reversed by Dex. In addition, Dex promoted the expressions of NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophins-3 (NT-3), and NT-4 in CCI rats. Moreover, the RNA or protein expression levels of OX42 and GFAP were significantly increased in CCI rats, while Dex inhibited the expressions of OX42 and GFAP. Furthermore, Dex blocked JAK/STAT signaling pathway by decreasing p-JAK and p-STAT in CCI rats. Dex had the potential to alleviate NPP by regulating JAK/STAT pathway in CCI rat.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677355>The impact of hypoxaemia on vascular function in lowlanders and high altitude indigenous populations.</a></h2><p>Exposure to hypoxia elicits widespread physiological responses that are critical for successful acclimatization; however, these responses may induce apparent maladaptive consequences. For example, recent studies conducted in both the laboratory and field (e.g. high-altitude) have demonstrated that endothelial function is reduced in hypoxia. Herein, we review the several proposed mechanism(s) pertaining to the observed reduction in endothelial function in hypoxia including: a) changes in blood flow patterns (i.e. shear stress), b) increased  and production of reactive oxygen species (i.e. oxidative stress), c) heightened sympathetic nervous activity, and d) increased red blood cell concentration and mass leading to elevated nitric-oxide scavenging. Although some of these mechanism(s) have been examined in lowlanders, less in known about endothelial function in indigenous populations who have chronically adapted to environmental hypoxia for millennia (e.g. the Peruvian, Tibetan, and Ethiopian highlanders). There is some evidence indicating that healthy Tibetan and Peruvian (i.e. Andean) highlanders have preserved endothelial function at high-altitude, but less is known about the Ethiopian highlanders. However, Andean highlanders suffering from chronic mountain sickness, which is characterized by an excessive production of red blood cells, have markedly reduced endothelial function. This review will provide a framework and mechanistic model for vascular endothelial adaptation to hypoxia in lowlanders and highlanders. Elucidating the pathways responsible for vascular adaption/maladaptation to hypoxia has potential clinical implications for disease featuring low oxygen delivery (e.g. heart failure, pulmonary disease). In addition, a greater understanding of vascular function at high-altitude will clinically benefit the globally estimated 85 million high-altitude residents. Abstract Figure: Overview of the conventional mechanism(s) that govern endothelial function in normoxic and hypoxic humans. This figure depicts the primary mechanism(s) governing changes in endothelial-dependent vascular smooth muscle vasodilation. Chronic, hypoxia (normobaric and hypobaric) results in 1) an increase in pro-atherogenic shear stress, ) heightened sympathetic nervous activity, 3) elevations in oxidative-nitrosative-inflammatory (OXINOS) stress defined by a free radical/-mediated reduction in vascular nitric oxide bioavailability, and 4) during chronic hypoxia exposure leading to increased red blood cell concentration - increased red blood cell mediated nitric oxide scavenging. Arterial segments that are chronically exposed to low, and oscillatory shear stress preferentially develop atherosclerotic lesions (Caro et al., 1969; Ku et al., 1985). Increased pro-atherogenic shear stress during hypoxia may be related to increased sympathetic nervous system outflow, which results in increased norepinephrine (i.e. NE) release sympathetic ganglia (T1-T5, upper body vasculature; T6-L2, lower body vasculature) onto α and β adrenergic receptors, which signal for smooth muscle vasoconstriction and vasodilation, respectively. A stimulus (e.g. shear stress) results in a release of endothelial endogenous calcium, which binds to calmodulin, and activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). The production of eNOS converts L-arginine into L-citrulline, and while doing so, releases nitric oxide. The newly produced nitric oxide is able to diffuse across the endothelial cell membrane and into the nearby smooth muscle cells. Within the smooth muscle cells, nitric oxide activates guanylate cyclase, and guanylate cyclase converts guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) into cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP). The cGMP upregulates cGMP dependent protein kinase G (PKG), which acts to inhibit myosin light chain kinase resulting in smooth muscle cell relaxation (Adelstein et al., 1978; Kerrick & Hoar, 1981). Upregulated cGMP also phosphorylates voltage-gated potassium channels resulting in potassium cellular extrusion, contributing to smooth muscle relaxation (Irvine et al., 2003). In addition, there is some evidence that suggests that NO may independently activate voltage-gated potassium channels (Bolotina et al., 1994). This article is protected by copyright.

One of the mechanisms associated with the regulation of intracellular calcium is linked to ERK (Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase) and its phosphorylated condition (pERK). ERK phosphorylation is important for intracellular signal transduction and participates in regulating neuroplasticity and inflammatory responses. The aim of this study is to analyse the expression of two CaBPs and pERK in astrocytes and neurons in rat trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc) after experimental periapical  on the left mandibular first molar. At seven days post-treatment, the periapical inflammatory stimulus induces an increase in pERK expression both in S100b positive astrocytes and Calbindin D28k positive neurons, in the ipsilateral Vc with respect to the contralateral side and control group. pERK was observed coexpressing with S100b in astrocytes and in fusiform Calbindin D28k neurons in lamina I. These results could indicate that neural plasticity and pain sensitization could be maintained by ERK activation in projection neurons at 7 days after the periapical .Sociedad Argentina de Investigación Odontológica.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669433>Rate and predictors of bacteremia in afebrile community-acquired pneumonia.</a></h2><p>Although blood cultures (BCs) are the gold standard for detecting bacteremia, the utility of BCs in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is controversial. This study describes the proportion of patients with CAP and afebrile bacteremia and identifies the clinical characteristics predicting the necessity for BCs in afebrile patients.Bacteremia rates were determined in 4349 CAP patients enrolled in the multi-national cohort study CAPNETZ and stratified by presence of fever at first patient contact. Independent predictors of bacteremia in afebrile patients were determined retrospectively using logistic regression analysis.Bacteremic pneumonia was present in 190 of 2116 (8.9%) febrile patients, 101 of 2149 (4.7%) afebrile patients and 1 of 23 (4.3%) hypothermic patients. Bacteremia rates increased with the CURB-65 score from 3.5% in patients with CURB-65 score of 0 to 17.1% in patients with CURB-65 score of 4. Patients with afebrile bacteremia exhibited the highest 28-day mortality rate (9.9%). Positive pneumococcal urinary antigen test (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 4.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) .6-8.), C-reactive protein >200 mg/l (AOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.9-5.) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) ≥30 mg/dl (AOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.9-5.3) were independent positive predictors and antibiotic pre-treatment (AOR 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.1-0.6) was an independent negative predictor of bacteremia in afebrile patients.A relevant proportion of patients with bacteremic CAP was afebrile. These patients had an increased mortality rate compared to patients with febrile bacteremia or non-bacteremic pneumonia. Therefore, the relevance of fever as an indicator for BC necessity merits reconsideration.Copyright © 2019.

The advanced lung cancer  index (ALI) is thought to be able to reflect systemic  better than current biomarkers. However, the prognostic significance of the ALI in various types of cancer remains unclear. Our meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively investigate the relationship between the ALI and oncologic outcomes to help physicians better assess the prognosis of cancer patients.The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases were searched for relevant studies. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated and pooled from the included studies. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the reliability of the articles. Finally, Begg's test, Egger's test, and the funnel plot were applied to assess the significance of publication bias.In total, 1736 patients from nine studies were included in our meta-analysis. The median cutoff value for the ALI was 23. (range, 15.5-37.66) in the analyzed studies. The meta-analysis showed that there was a statistically significant relationship between a low ALI and worse overall survival (OS) in various types of cancer (HR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.41-1.99, P < 0.001). Moreover, results from subgroup meta-analysis showed that the ALI had a significant prognostic value in non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (P < 0.05 for all).These results showed that a low ALI was associated with poor OS in various types of cancer, and the ALI could act as an effective prognostic biomarker in cancer patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673418>Cartilage-gut-microbiome axis: a new paradigm for novel therapeutic opportunities in osteoarthritis.</a></h2><p>DNA of gut microbiota can be found in synovium of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. This finding could result from the translocation of still alive bacteria from gut to joints through blood, since the diversified dormant microbiota of healthy human blood can be transiently resuscitated in vitro. The recent finding of gut microbiome in human cartilage, which differed between osteoarthritis and controls, suggests that a similar trafficking of dead or alive bacteria from gut microbiota physiologically occurs between gut and epiphysial bone marrow. Subchondral microbiota could enhance cartilage healing and transform components of deep cartilage matrix in metabolites with immunosuppressive properties. The differences of microbiome observed between hip and knee cartilage, either in osteoarthritis or controls, might be the counterpart of subtle differences in chondrocyte metabolism, themselves in line with differences in DNA methylation according to joints. Although bacteria theoretically cannot reach chondrocytes from the surface of intact cartilage, some bacteria enter the vascular channels of the epiphysial growth cartilage in young animals, whereas others can infect chondrocytes in vitro. In osteoarthritis, the early osteochondral plate angiogenesis may further enhance the ability of microbiota to locate close to the deeper layers of cartilage, and this might lead to focal dysbiosis, low-grade , cartilage degradation, epigenetic changes in chondrocytes and worsening of osteoarthritis. More studies on cartilage across different ethnic groups, weights, and according to age, are needed, to confirm the silent presence of gut microbiota close to human cartilage and better understand its physiologic and pathogenic significance.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Iron fortificants adversely affect the infant gut microbiota, while co-provision of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) mitigates most of the adverse effects. Whether variations in maternal HMO profile can influence the infant response to iron and/or GOS fortificants is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine HMO profiles and the secretor/non-secretor phenotype of lactating Kenyan mothers and investigate their effects on the maternal and infant gut microbiota, and on the infant response to a fortification intervention with 5 mg iron (.5 mg as sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate and .5 mg as ferrous fumarate) and 7.5 g GOS. We studied mother-infant pairs ( = 80) participating in a 4-month intervention trial in which the infants (aged 6.5-9.5 months) received daily a micronutrient powder without iron, with iron or with iron and GOS. We assessed: (1) maternal secretor status and HMO composition; () effects of secretor status on the maternal and infant gut microbiota in a cross-sectional analysis at baseline of the intervention trial; and (3) interactions between secretor status and intervention groups during the intervention trial on the infant gut microbiota, gut , iron status, growth and infectious morbidity. Secretor prevalence was 72% and HMOs differed between secretors and non-secretors and over time of lactation. Secretor status did not predict the baseline composition of the maternal and infant gut microbiota. There was a secretor-status-by-intervention-group interaction on  ( = 0.021), Z-scores for length-for-age ( = 0.022) and weight-for-age ( = 0.018), and soluble transferrin receptor ( = 0.041). In the no iron group, longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea was higher among infants of non-secretors (23.8%) than of secretors (10.4%) ( = 0.001). In conclusion, HMO profile may modulate the infant gut microbiota response to fortificant iron; compared to infants of secretor mothers, infants of non-secretor mothers may be more vulnerable to the adverse effect of iron but also benefit more from the co-provision of GOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668400>Protective effects of lactoferrin on injured intestinal epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Lactoferrin has been used as a milk supplement to prevent disease progression in necrotizing enterocolitis. However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. We hypothesize that lactoferrin administration can modulate intestinal epithelial cell injury.We established an in vitro model of epithelial cell injury by treating rat intestinal epithelial cells IEC-18 and human Caco- cells with hydrogen peroxide (HO), while lactoferrin was added as treatment at the same time. Live/dead cells were detected by immunofluorescence. Gene expression of inflammatory markers interleukin-6 (IL-6), intestinal stem cells (Lgr5), and proliferation marker (Wnt/β-catenin) were measured. Data was presented as mean ± SEM and compared using one-way ANOVA. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant.Compared to control cells, HO induced cell death in both IEC-18 and Caco- cells, whereas treatment with lactoferrin maintained cell viability. In addition, lactoferrin reduced gene expression of IL-6, while it increased gene expression of Lgr5 and Wnt/β-catenin.Intestinal cell injury can be induced by exposure to HO, mimicking epithelial damage during intestinal injury. This damage can be reversed by lactoferrin administration by reducing  and inducing cell proliferation. Lactoferrin can be a potential pharmacological intervention for the prevention and recovery of intestinal epithelial injury.Copyright © 2019.

We investigated associations of low bone mineral density (BMD) at various bone sites with five year all-cause and CVD mortality in ESRD patients.In a post hoc analysis of 426 ESRD patients (median age 56 years, 62% men) starting dialysis, BMD (whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, DXA), body composition, nutritional status (subjective global assessment, SGA), handgrip strength (%HGS), Framingham CVD risk score (FRS) and biochemical biomarkers of nutrition and  were assessed. We used the Fine and Gray competing risk regression analysis to assess survival analysis.In multivariate logistic regression analysis, %HGS and intact parathyroid hormone associated with low tertile of: BMD, BMD and BMD, after adjusting for FRS, SGA, %HGS, s-albumin, hsCRP, lean body mass index and year of recruitment. Patients with high FRS had low BMD (p < 0.001). Low tertile of BMD (sHR, 1.53), BMD (sHR 1.54) and BMD (sHR 1.60) associated with increased all-cause mortality whereas no such associations were found for the trabecular bone rich sites BMD arm, leg, trunk, rib or spine. Low tertile of BMD (sHR 1.94), BMD (sHR 1.68), BMD (sHR .25) and BMD (sHR .45) associated with increased CVD mortality whereas BMD at other sites did not associate with CVD mortality.Low head and pelvis BMD, and low total BMD, as assessed by whole-body DXA, were independent predictors of increased risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. Cortical BMD appeared to have stronger association to survival in ESRD than trabecular BMD.Copyright © 2019.

The cornerstone of eczema management is to repair and maintain skin barrier and hydration, as well as to reduce . Wet wrap therapy (WWT) is a widely used adjunct to achieve this. The conventional material used for WWT is viscose, which presents drawbacks including discomfort, high cost, and poor durability. Here, we explore the possibility of using customized nanotextile (nanopolyester) for WWT, hoping to prove that this material is non-inferior to viscose in clinical effectiveness and patient acceptance.Patients aged 0-18 years with moderate to severe eczema were randomized to receive either viscose (Tubifast™) or nanotextile for WWT. Patients were instructed to apply WWT daily overnight for  weeks. Patients' disease severity score (IGA, SCORAD) and quality of life (QoL) score (IDQOL/CDLQI) were measured on day 0, 7, and 14 of treatment. Patient survey was conducted to collect patients' feedback about garment use.Fifty-three children aged 7 months to 17 years were recruited (27 in Tubifast™ and 26 in nanotextile group). Patients in both groups showed significant improvement in disease severity and QoL from baseline (P < .001), and such improvement was similar in both groups. However, nanotextile garment was significantly more comfortable (.73/10 vs 5.12/10, P = .001), easier to wear (.78/10 vs 5.24/10, P = .003), and cooler (.43/10 vs 3.96/10, P = .033) from patients' feedback.This study demonstrates that nanomaterial is as effective as conventional viscose in WWT, while superior in patient acceptability. Nanotextile for WWT has good potential in eczema management, especially in patients with suboptimal response to topicals alone.© 2019 The Authors.

Sterile endophthalmitis uncommonly complicates office-based IVTA injection. The authors report a new complication of IVTA depot injection at the end of PPV.Retrospective records review of all patients treated at the Cincinnati Eye Institute with PPV between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2017, who developed a triad of sterile endophthalmitis, atrophic retinal breaks under the depot IVTA in the inferior retina, and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). Eyes with flap tears, solely superior breaks, or stretch holes from proliferative vitreoretinopathy causing RRD were excluded.Eight eyes of eight patients (four males and four females; mean age: 73.7 years) who received 4 mg or 8 mg IVTA depot at the end of PPV surgery presented at a mean of 23.5 days following PPV with RRD (one macula-involving, seven macula-sparing), requiring treatment with PPV in six eyes and laser retinopexy alone in two eyes. Seven eyes that underwent membrane peeling (MP) received IVT to prevent cystoid macular edema (CME) and one eye with prior MP was treated for CME. Mean vitreous  was + cell at 1 week postoperatively. Two patients had documented sterile endophthalmitis within the first week requiring vitreous cultures and antibiotics injections. Visual acuity (VA) for eyes requiring PPV for RD repair declined from 20/90 preoperatively to 20/212 at 6 months postoperatively. VA for eyes amenable to laser alone improved from 20/53 to 20/35. All eyes remained attached, with the exception of one patient who refused further treatment after developing recurrent detachment from PVR.Particle-induced sterile endophthalmitis from IVTA depot at the end of PPV surgery resulted in atrophic inferior retinal breaks and RRD as a newly described entity coined "erosive retinopathy." All retinal detachment surgeries required silicone oil tamponade. Poor visual outcome at 6 months was common for eyes requiring PPV for RD repair. The authors recommend avoiding IVTA depot injection at the end of PPV.

The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the energy status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by insulin and amino acid availability, and its metabolic actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing resistance to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive  and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino acid supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; ) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Preclinical studies suggest that the host response to an injurious challenge is age-dependent. In ARDS patients, we investigated whether the association between age and mortality is mediated through age-related differences in the host response.This was a prospective longitudinal observational cohort study, performed in the ICUs of two university-affiliated hospitals. The systemic host response was characterized in three predefined age-groups, based on the age-tertiles of the studied population: young (18 to 54 years, N = 209), middle-aged (55 to 67 years, N = 213), and elderly (67 years and older, N = 196). Biomarkers of , endothelial activation, and coagulation were determined in plasma obtained at the onset of ARDS. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. A mediation analysis was performed to examine whether age-related differences in biomarker levels serve as potential causal pathways mediating the association between age and mortality.Ninety-day mortality rates were 30% (63/209) in young, 37% (78/213) in middle-aged, and 43% (84/196) in elderly patients. Middle-aged and elderly patients had a higher risk of death compared to young patients (adjusted odds ratio, 1.5 [95% confidence interval 1.0 to .3] and .1 [1.4 to 3.4], respectively). Relative to young patients, the elderly had significantly lower systemic levels of biomarkers of  and endothelial activation. Tissue plasminogen activator, a marker of coagulation, was the only biomarker that showed partial mediation (proportion of mediation, 10 [1 to 28] %).Little evidence was found that the association between age and mortality in ARDS patients is mediated through age-dependent differences in host response pathways. Only tissue plasminogen activator was identified as a possible mediator of interest.This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier  , date of registration July 23, 2013).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665127>miR-34b Alleviates High Glucose-Induced  and Apoptosis in Human HK- Cells via IL-6R/JAK2/STAT3 Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND It is well established that  and apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells caused by hyperglycemia contribute to the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Although microRNAs (miRNAs) are known to have roles in -related disorders, the exact role of miR-34b in DN has not been defined, and the regulatory mechanism has been unclear. This study aimed to clarify the role of miR-34b in DN pathogenesis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Expression of miR-34b, IL-6R, and other key factors of , apoptosis (TNF-alpha, IL-1ß, IL-6, caspase-3) in high glucose (HG)-induced HK- cells were measured by real-time PCR, Western blot, and flow cytometric cell apoptosis assays. We used luciferase reporter assay to detect the target of miR-34b. Moreover, the targeting gene of miR-34b and its downstream JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway were explored. RESULTS It was demonstrated that miR-34b overexpression inhibited apoptosis and expression levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1ß, IL-6, and caspase-3 in HG-treated HK- cells. We also found that IL-6R is a direct target of miR-34b, which could rescue  and apoptosis in HG-treated HK- cells transfected with miR-34b mimic. Furthermore, we showed that overexpression of miR-34b inhibited the IL-6R/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in HG-treated HK- cells. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that overexpression of miR-34b improves  and ameliorates apoptosis in HG-induced HK- cells via the IL-6R/JAK2/STAT3 pathway, indicating that miR-34b could be a promising therapeutic target in DN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676600>Hydrogen peroxide gates a voltage-dependent cation current in  neuroendocrine cells.</a></h2><p>Non-selective cation channels promote persistent spiking in many neurons from a diversity of animals. In the hermaphroditic marine-snail, , synaptic input to the neuroendocrine bag cell neurons triggers various cation channels, causing an ∼30-min afterdischarge of action potentials and the secretion of egg-laying hormone. During the afterdischarge, protein kinase C (PKC) is also activated, which in turn elevates HO, likely by stimulating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase. The present study investigated if HO regulates cation channels to drive the afterdischarge. In single, cultured bag cell neurons, HO elicited a prolonged, concentration- and voltage-dependent inward current, associated with an increase in membrane conductance and a reversal potential of ∼+30 mV. Compared to normal saline, the presence of Ca-free, Na-free, or Na/Ca-free extracellular saline, lowered the current amplitude and left-shifted the reversal potential, consistent with a non-selective cationic conductance. Preventing HO reduction with the glutathione peroxidase inhibitor, mercaptosuccinate, enhanced the HO-induced current, while boosting glutathione production with its precursor, N-acetylcysteine, or adding the reducing agent, dithiothreitol, lessened the response. Moreover, the current generated by the alkylating agent, N-ethylmaleimide, occluded the effect of HO The HO-induced current was inhibited by tetrodotoxin as well as the cation channel blockers, 9-phenanthrol and clotrimazole. In current-clamp, HO stimulated burst firing, but this was attenuated or prevented altogether by the channel blockers. Finally, HO evoked an afterdischarge from whole bag cell neuron clusters recorded  by sharp-electrode. HO may regulate a cation channel to influence long-term changes in activity and ultimately reproduction.Hydrogen peroxide (HO) is often studied in a pathological context, such as ischemia or . However, HO also physiologically modulates synaptic transmission and gates certain transient receptor potential channels. That stated, the effect of HO on neuronal excitability remains less well-defined. Here, we examine how HO influences  bag cell neurons, which elicit ovulation by releasing hormones during an afterdischarge. These neuroendocrine cells are uniquely identifiable and amenable to recording as individual cultured neurons or a cluster from the nervous system. In both culture and the cluster, HO evokes prolonged, afterdischarge-like bursting by gating a non-selective voltage-dependent cationic current. Thus, HO, which is generated in response to afterdischarge-associated second messengers, may prompt the firing necessary for hormone secretion and procreation.Copyright © 2019 the authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671219>Prediagnostic Circulating  Biomarkers and Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Case-Cohort Study in Japan.</a></h2><p>Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the predominant histologic subtype of esophageal cancer worldwide. Measurements of circulating -related biomarkers may inform etiology or provide non-invasive signatures for early diagnosis. We therefore examined levels of  molecules for associations with ESCC risk. Using a case-cohort study designed within the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study, we measured baseline plasma levels of 92 biomarkers using a multiplex assay in a subcohort of 410 randomly selected participants and 66 participants with incident ESCC (including 4 cases that occurred in the subcohort). ESCC hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for -4 quantiles of each biomarker by Cox proportional hazards regression models with age as the time metric, adjusted for sex, smoking and alcohol use. Twenty analytes were undetectable in nearly all samples. Of the remaining 72, 12 biomarkers (FGF19, ST1A1, STAMBP, AXIN1, CASP8, NT3, CD6, CDCP1, CD5, SLAMF1, OPG and CSF1) were associated with increased ESCC risk (P <0.05) with HRs per quantile 1.28-1.65. Seven biomarkers (CXCL6, CCL23, CXCL5, TGFA, CXCL1, OSM and CCL4) were inversely associated with HRs 0.57-0.72. FGF19, CASP8, STAMBP, ST1A1 and CCL-4 met statistical significance with false discovery rate correction. Associations did not differ <5 vs. ≥5 years between blood collection and ESCC diagnosis. CASP8, STAMBP and ST1A1 were strongly correlated (p<0.05). This study expands the range of  molecules associated with the development of this highly lethal neoplasia. Correlations among these novel biomarkers suggest a possible shared pathway. These findings need replication and could further delineate ESCC's molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis.

All patients had follow-up biopsy (Bx) after treatment.33 (9.1%) patients had diagnosis of AMR. Mean follow-up was 35 ± 20 months. 28.5% of patients had poor clinical progression at the last follow-up. Of the 25 patients with functional grafts, the mean serum creatinine was 1.6 ± 0.6 mg/dL for live and .1 ± 1.0 mg/dL for deceased transplant recipients. In diagnostic biopsies, there were 61% MTR. In follow-up Bx, after treatment, both C4d positivity and the severity of rejection had decreased while the mean chronic allograft damage index (CADI) score and transplant glomerulopathy showed an increase.With effective antibody mediated rejection (AMR) therapy, renal function parameters were significantly improved. Histologically, improvement in tubulointerstitial  may be responsible for this process. However, progressive chronic changes, particularly in the glomeruli, are noteworthy. .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673422>Canada-Denmark MRI scoring system of the spine in patients with axial spondyloarthritis: updated definitions, scoring rules and inter-reader reliability in a multiple reader setting.</a></h2><p>To validate the Canada-Denmark (CANDEN) MRI scoring system for the spine in axial spondyloarthritis with updated lesion definitions.Lesion definitions in the CANDEN system were updated and illustrated by a consensus set of reference images.

Here, we aimed to determine the normal reference values for USPIO-enhanced MRI in patients with a prior cardiac transplant and examine whether USPIO-enhanced MRI could detect myocardial  in patients with transplant rejection.Ten volunteers and 11 patients with cardiac transplant underwent T2, T2* and late gadolinium enhancement 1.5T MRI, with further T2* imaging at 24 hours after USPIO (ferumoxytol, 4 mg/kg) infusion, at baseline and 3 months.Ten patients with clinically stable cardiac transplantation were retained for analysis. Myocardial T2 values were higher in patients with cardiac transplant versus healthy volunteers (53.8±5. vs 48.6±1.9 ms, respectively; p=0.003). There were no differences in the magnitude of USPIO-induced change in R2* in patients with transplantation (change in R2*, 26.6±7.3 vs 22.0±10.4 s in healthy volunteers; p=0.28).

Baseline clinical factors such as asthma may portend the development of pneumonitis due to pre-existing airway  prior to immunotherapy.The purpose of the study was to investigate whether a prior diagnosis of asthma is associated with an increased risk of immune-related pneumonitis in patients undergoing cancer immunotherapy.Patients at the Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health undergoing immunotherapy were identified on an IRB-approved protocol. Clinical charts were reviewed for asthma documented in the medical records and CT scans were reviewed during and after treatment. Pneumonitis was defined as the onset of new pulmonary symptoms with characteristic imaging findings during or after a patient's first course of immunotherapy that could not be readily explained as infection or a progression of malignancy. It was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.A total of 187 patients were included. A diagnosis of asthma was found in the records of 26 cases (13.9%). Pneumonitis was found in 10 cases (5.35%); 50% were grade  and 50% were grade 3-4. Two of the grade 3-4 cases (40%) occurred in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Three patients with asthma developed pneumonitis (11.5% of patients with asthma), all grade 3-4. Only 28.6% of the non-asthma-pneumonitis cases were grade 3-4. All (100%) of the asthma-pneumonitis patients were former smokers, while 71.4% of the non-asthma-pneumonitis patients were former smokers.A history of asthma may be associated with a higher grade of pneumonitis if it develops, and a history of smoking may augment this relationship.© 2019 S.

The nitric oxide (NO) concentration in exhaled gas (FeNO) has been used as an indicator of POT, but the effect of SCUBA diving on FeNO has rarely been studied. The study presented here aimed to assess alterations to pulmonary function and FeNO following a 12-h dive using breathing apparatus with a relatively high partial pressure of oxygen.Six healthy, male, non-smoking military SCUBA divers were recruited (age 31.8 ± .7 years, height 179 ± 0.09 cm, and body weight 84.6 ± 14 kg). Each diver completed a 12-h dive using a demand-controlled semi-closed-circuit rebreather. During the 12 h of immersion, divers were subjected to 672 oxygen toxicity units (OTU). A complete pulmonary function test (PFT) was completed the day before and immediately after immersion. FeNO was measured using a Nobreath™ Quark (COSMED™, Rome, Italy), three times for each diver. The first datapoint was collected before the dive to establish the "basal state", a second was collected immediately after divers emerged from the water, and the final measurement was taken 24 h after the dive.Despite prolonged inhalation of a hyperoxic hyperbaric gas mixture, no clinical pulmonary symptoms were observed, and no major changes in pulmonary function were detected. However, a major decrease in FeNO values was observed immediately after emersion [0-12 ppb (median, 3.8 ppb)], with a return to baseline [-60 ppb (median, 26 ppb) 24 h later (3-73 ppb (median, 24.7 ppb)].These results suggest that if the OTU remain below the recommended limit values, but does alter FeNO, this type of dive does not persistently impair lung function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669718>The effect of the inhalation of and topical exposure to zinc oxide nanoparticles on airway  in mice.</a></h2><p>Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) are widely used in the manufacturing of many commercial products.

Our previous study suggested that the oropharyngeal aspiration of ZnONPs could cause eosinophilic airway  and increase T helper  (Th2) cytokine expression in the absence of allergens in mice. ZnO has been used topically as a sunscreen and a therapeutic agent for dermatological conditions. To understand whether inhalation and topically applied ZnONPs might cause or exert an adjuvant effect on the development of allergic airway  in mice, C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to filtered air or .5 mg/m ZnONPs via whole-body inhalation for 5 h a day over 5 days, and BALB/c mice were topically exposed to ZnONPs using modified mouse models of atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma. Ovalbumin (OVA) solution was used as an allergen in the topical exposure experiments. A significantly increased eosinophil count and mixed Th1/Th2 cytokine expression were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) after ZnONP inhalation. However, only mild eosinophilia and low Th2 cytokine expression were detected in the BALF after oropharyngeal OVA aspiration in the high-dose ZnONP topical treatment group.

Of all cancer-related deaths, 15 to 20% are associated with , where proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the tumorigenesis process. The current study investigated the effects of the polyphenolic compound butein (',3,4,4'-tetrahydroxychalcone) on cell proliferation and survival, as well as its modulatory effect on the release of proinflammatory cytokines in MDA-MB-231 (Caucasian) and MDA-MB-468 (African American) TNBC cell. The results obtained showed that butein decreased cell viability in a time and dose-dependent manner, and after 72-h of treatment, the cell proliferation rate was reduced in both cell lines. In addition, butein was found to have higher potency in MDA-MB-468, exhibiting anti-proliferative effects in lower concentrations. Apoptosis assays demonstrated that butein (50 μM) increased apoptotic cells in MDA MB-468, showing 60% of the analyzed cells in the apoptotic phase, compared to 20% in MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, butein downregulated both protein and mRNA expression of the proinflammatory cytokine, CCL2, and IKBKE in TNFα-activated Caucasian cells, but not in African Americans. This study demonstrates butein potential in cancer cell suppression showing a higher cytotoxic, anti-proliferative, and apoptotic effects in African Americans, compared to Caucasians TNBC cells. It also reveals the butein inhibitory effect on CCL2 expression with a possible association with IKBKE downregulation in MDA-MB-231 cells only, indicating that Caucasians and African Americans TNBC cells respond differently to butein treatment. The obtained findings may provide an explanation regarding the poor therapeutic response in African American patients with advanced TNBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673224>Upregulation of the IL-33/ST2 pathway in dry eye.</a></h2><p>Dry eye (DE) is a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that results in symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. Although the pathogenesis of dry eye has not been fully understood, the role of increased tear osmolarity has been established. There is increasing evidence that dry eye is an inflammatory disease. This article aims to investigate the potential pathogenicity of inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-33 and its receptor ST2 in dry eye.Human conjunctival epithelial cells (HConECs) were stimulated with hyperosmolality to produce a dry eye cell model. Real-time PCR evaluated the IL-33 mRNA level, and western blotting assessed IL-33 protein expression. Clinical data (sex, age, ocular surface disease index [OSDI] score, tear film breakup time, Schirmer test, and corneal fluorescein staining [CFS]) of patients with DE were collected. Conjunctival impression cytology (CIC) specimens were collected to detect the protein expression of IL-33 and ST2 with western blotting. Tears were collected with Schirmer strips, and analyzed using multiplex assay kits to examine IL-33 and its downstream factors IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13.The IL-33 mRNA level of the HConECs increased in the hyperosmotic state (relative 4.35-fold upregulation, p<0.001). The IL-33 protein expression of HConECs also showed higher levels in the hyperosmotic state (relative .22-fold upregulation, p<0.01). A total of 25 patients with dry eye and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled. There were no statistically significant differences in age and sex between the two groups. The OSDI score, tear film breakup time, Schirmer test, and ocular surface staining of the two groups were statistically significantly different. The IL-33 and ST2 protein levels were increased in patients with DE versus controls (IL-33: relative 9.25-fold upregulation, p<0.001; ST2: relative 4.35-fold upregulation, p<0.05). The concentrations of IL-33, IL-13, and IL-5 in tears increased in patients with DE versus controls (IL-33: 3.00-fold upregulation, p<0.0001; IL-13: 6.65-fold upregulation, p<0.0001; IL-5: 16.54 -fold upregulation, p=0.01). IL-13 and IL-5 were statistically significantly correlated with IL-33. The level of IL-33 was positively correlated with the OSDI score and CFS, but was negatively correlated with the Schirmer I test and the tear film breakup time (TBUT). The level of IL-13 was positively correlated only with the CFS, and was negatively correlated with the Schirmer I test. The level of IL-5 was positively correlated with the OSDI score and CFS. We failed to detect the concentration of IL-4, as most samples were below the detection limit.The IL-33 mRNA and protein levels of HConECs increased under hyperosmolality. The IL-33 and ST2 protein levels were higher in the CIC of patients with DE, and have correlations with disease severity. Moreover, the concentrations of IL-13 and IL-5 released from activated type  helper T (Th2) cells increased in the tears of patients with DE. The IL-33/ST2 pathway might play a priming role in the regulation of  of the ocular surface.Copyright © 2019 Molecular Vision.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677056>The Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio is a Prognostic Biomarker in An Ethnically Diverse Patient Population with Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.</a></h2><p>The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is associated with decreased overall survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) in studies including few minority patients. We investigated the association between NLR and survival in patients with advanced PAC in an ethnically diverse population.We retrospectively evaluated 226 patients with advanced PAC treated at Montefiore Medical Center between 2006 and 2015. Adjusted Cox proportion hazard regression models were utilized to derive effect estimates for survival duration.Patients with a NLR ≤ 5 (126 patients, median age 66 years) were more likely to be non-Hispanic Black (30.8% vs. 20%), while patients with a NLR > 5 (70 patients, median age 66 years) were more likely to be non-Hispanic White (21.4% vs. 12.%) or Hispanic (44.3% vs. 34%). A NLR > 5 compared with a NLR ≤ 5 was significantly associated with a worse overall survival when adjusted for a priori and exploratory variables from the univariate analysis (median survival 7.4 vs. 12 months, HR 1.650, 95% CI 1.139, .390).In an ethnically diverse population, elevated NLR is an independent marker of poor prognosis and a potentially valuable factor in driving therapeutic decisions and defining prognosis for patients in the locally advanced or metastatic for PAC setting, meriting investigation in prospective clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671427>Inhibition of hypothalamic inhibitor κ B kinase β/nuclear transcription factor κ B pathway attenuates metabolism and cardiac dysfunction in type  diabetic rats.</a></h2><p> and oxidative stressplay important roles in energy imbalance and its complications.Recent research indicates that hypothalamic  may contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and cardiac dysfunction, but the mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that suppression of proinflammatory pathway of IKKβ/NF-κBin the hypothalamuscan improve energy balance and cardiac function in type  diabetic (T2D)rats.Normal rats and T2D rats received bilateral hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) infusions of IKKβ inhibitor SC-514 or vehicle via osmotic minipump.Metabolic phenotyping, immunohistochemical analyses, and biochemical analyses were used to investigate the outcomes of inhibition of the hypothalamic IKKβ. Echocardiography and glucometer were used for measuring cardiac function and blood glucose,respectively. Blood samples were collected for the evaluation of circulating proinflammatory cytokines (PICs). Heart was harvested for cardiacmorphology evaluations. The ARC was harvested and analyzed for IKKβ, NF-κB, PICs, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NAD(P)H (gp91phox,p47phox) oxidase activitylevels and neuropeptides.Compared with normal rats, T2D rats were characterized by hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, cardiac dysfunction, as well as higher ARC levels of IKKβ, NF-κB, PICs, ROS, gp91phox and p47phox. ARC infusion of IKKβ inhibitor SC-514 attenuated all these changes in T2D rats, but not in normal rats.Our results indicate that hypothalamic IKKβ/NF-κB pathway plays a key role in modulatingenergy imbalance and cardiac dysfunction, suggesting its potential therapeutic role during type 2diabetes.© 2019 S.

The reported prevalence rate of complete IgA deficiency in healthy children ranges from 1:170 to 1:400, and as a solitary condition, it is often considered of limited clinical importance. However, patients with IgA deficiency can develop recurrent respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, as well as allergic and autoimmune diseases. In children referred for recurrent respiratory tract infections, the observed prevalence rate increases more than tenfold. This review discusses several aspects of IgA deficiency in children, including immunologic and microbiome changes in early childhood and the potential consequences of this condition in later life. It illustrates the importance of early identification of children with impaired IgA production who deserve appropriate clinical care and follow-up.Copyright © 2018.

K1.3 ion channel is a voltage-gated potassium channel and has been validated as a drug target for autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases like psoriasis. Here we experimentally test the direct interaction between monoterpenes and K1.3 ion channel. Our electrophysiological analysis determined that monoterpenes (geraniol, nerol, β-citronellol, citral and linalool) have inhibitory effects on K1.3 ion channel. Representatively, geraniol reversibly blocked K1.3 currents in a voltage-dependent manner with an IC of 490.50 ± 1.04 μM at +40 mV in HEK293T cells. At the effective concentrations, geraniol also inhibited cytokine secretion of activated human T cells, including IL-, TNF-α and IFN-γ. In an imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like animal model, geraniol administration significantly reduced psoriasis area and severity index scores, ameliorated the deteriorating histopathology and decreased the degree of splenomegaly. Together, our findings not only suggest that monoterpenes may serve as lead molecules for the development of K1.3 inhibitors, but also indicate that geraniol could be considered as a promising therapeutic candidate to treat autoimmune diseases.Copyright © 2018.

Its role has become clear in pathological conditions such as fibrosis and . From translational research to laboratory medicine, considerable efforts have been made to elucidate the features of sST2 biomarker and to consider its contribution to HF management. In this review, we summarized the results from recent works concerning sST2, and particularly we focused on the interest of sST2 in conditions for which classical biomarkers value interpretation is misleading. Indeed, despite other HF biomarkers, sST2 was proved to be independent from common comorbidities such as renal dysfunction and hypertension. Thus, sST2 showed promise for a combined strategy with natriuretic peptides, mainly for specific categories of patients. Particular attention was paid to findings on sST2 in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), a form of HF for which reliable and specific biomarkers are awaited.

There has been concern about the effects of EMFs on the human body. Th9 cells, which are characterized by the generation of interleukin-(IL-9), are a recently defined subset of T helper (Th) cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of extremely low-frequency (60 Hz) EMFs, such as those generated by household power sources, at 0.8 mT intensity on CD4 T cells. The exposure of CD4 T cells to such EMFs under Th9-polarizing conditions increased IL-9 secretion and gene expression of transcription factors that are important for Th9 development. The expression of GATA3 increased in the early stage, and the phosphorylation of STAT5 and STAT6, which regulate the expression of GATA3, increased. In addition, EMFs increased the expression of IL- by the T cells. In conclusion, the differentiation of CD4 T cells to the Th9 phenotype was increased by exposure to extremely low-frequency EMFs, and this appeared to be dependent on the IL- signaling pathway. Furthermore, co-cultures of EMF-exposed Th9 cells and mast cells showed an increased expression of mast cell proteases, FcεR1α, and mast cell-derived inflammatory cytokines compared with co-cultures of non-EMF-exposed Th9 cells and mast cells.

Although atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP, respectively) produced in the heart control circulatory homeostasis through their common receptor, NPR1, the physiological and pathophysiological roles of endogenous ANP/BNP in the perinatal period are not fully understood.  To clarify the physiological and pathophysiological roles of the endogenous ANP/BNP-NPR1 system during the perinatal period, the phenotype of female wild-type and conventional or tissue-specific Npr1-knockout mice during the perinatal period was examined, especially focusing on maternal heart weight, blood pressure, and cardiac function.  In wild-type mice, lactation but not pregnancy induced reversible cardiac hypertrophy accompanied by increases in fetal cardiac gene mRNAs and ERK1/ phosphorylation. Npr1-knockout mice exhibited significantly higher plasma aldosterone level than did wild-type mice, severe cardiac hypertrophy accompanied by fibrosis, and left ventricular dysfunction in the lactation period. In addition, Npr1-knockout mice showed a high mortality rate over consecutive pregnancy-lactation cycles. In the hearts of Npr1-knockout mice during or after the lactation period, an increase in interleukin-6 mRNA expression, phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and activation of the calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells pathway were observed. Pharmacological inhibition of the mineralocorticoid receptor or neuron-specific deletion of the mineralocorticoid receptor gene significantly ameliorated cardiac hypertrophy in lactating Npr1-knockout mice. Anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody administration tended to reduce cardiac hypertrophy in lactating Npr1-knockout mice.  These results suggest that the characteristics of lactation-induced cardiac hypertrophy in wild-type mice are different from exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy, and that the endogenous ANP/BNP-NPR1 system plays an important role in protecting the maternal heart from interleukin-6-induced  and remodeling in the lactation period, a condition mimicking peripartum cardiomyopathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669069>Deletion of Chitinase-3-like 1 accelerates stroke development through enhancement of Neuroinflammation by STAT6-dependent M2 microglial inactivation in Chitinase-3-like 1 knockout mice.</a></h2><p>Chitinase 3-like 1 (Chi3L1) plays a major role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. We investigated the effect of Chi3L1 knockout on stroke development. Ischemia/reperfusion was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in Chi3L1 knockout and wildtype mice. Significantly increased infarct volume and decreased neurological deficit scores at 24 h after ischemia/reperfusion were found in Chi3L1 knockout mice compared to wildtype mice. Moreover, ischemic neuronal cell death was increased in Chi3L1 knockout mice through increased oxidative stress and release of IL-6 and IL-1β but IL-10 and IL-4 were reduced. Furthermore, expression of -related proteins (iNOS, COX-, Iba-1, and GFAP) was significantly increased in Chi3L1 knockout mice compared to wildtype. In microglia isolated from MCAO-injured Chi3L1 knockout mice, expression of M1 markers (iNOS, CD86, IL-1β, and IL-6) was increased and M2 markers (Arg1, Mrc1, IL-10, and IL-4Ra) was decreased. In BV- cells, knockdown of Chi3L1 increased TNF-α- and INF-γ-induced expression of iNOS, COX-, and Iba-1, but decreased the expression of Arg1, MRC1, and IL-4 receptor-alpha (IL-4Rα). Expression of IL-4Rα, an important factor of M2 polarization, and its downstream signals p-JAK1, p-JAK3, and p-STAT6, was much reduced in the knockout mice. Additionally, in BV- cells, knockdown of Chi3L1 by siRNA Chi3L1 decreased rhTNF-α- and INF-γ-induced expression of IL-4Rα, p-JAK1, p-JAK3, and p-STAT6. Furthermore, treatment with AS1517499 abolished Chi3L1 knockdown-induced reduced IL-4Rα and Arg1 but not CD86 expression. Our results indicate that deletion of Chi3L1 accelerates stroke development through enhancement of neuroinflammation by markedly decreasing STAT6-dependent M2 macrophage polarization.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) has been observed prominently in obese and diabetic individuals, while alcoholic liver disease is common in alcoholic persons. Fatty liver disease, such as steatohepatitis, leads to fibrosis, cirrhosis and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) against high-fat diet (HFD) and ethanol (EtOH)-induced hepatotoxicity in rats.Male Wistar rats (150-200 g) were fed HFD (58% calories from fat) and EtOH (3-15% in drinking water) for 12 weeks. 7,8-DHF was administered intraperitoneally at the dose of 5 mg/kg/day for the last four weeks. After 12 weeks, biochemical, ELISA, RT-PCR, and histological studies have been carried out.Biochemical analyses revealed the involvement of oxidative stress and  in the liver of HFD and EtOH-fed rats. 7,8-DHF treatment significantly reduced HFD and EtOH-induced oxidative stress as evidenced by the reduction of lipid peroxidation and augmentation of reduced glutathione level. Moreover, IL-1β level was found significantly reduced in 7,8-DHF treated EtOH, HFD and EtOH+HFD groups. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR results indicated down-regulation of Nrf- and HO-1 and up-regulation of NF-κB and iNOS mRNA expression level in the liver of HFD and EtOH-fed rats, which was ameliorated by 7,8-DHF treatment.The present study suggested that 7,8-DHF could be an effective pharmacological intervention in combating HFD and EtOH-induced hepatotoxicity.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

The histopathological changes and the immune indices were evaluated in mice model. Genechip was conducted to identify genes and pathways regulated by ACS in HepG2..15 cells.In this study, we confirmed that ACS treatment prominently inhibited production of HBV DNA, Hepatitis Be Antigen (HBeAg), and Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in HepG2..15 cells. ACS treatment also decreased serum HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA level in rAAV8-1.3HBV transfected mice, which is in accordance with the in vitro results. Moreover, HBV infection-induced liver  was significantly relieved by ACS, which could be observed in H&E staining and immunohistochemistry of HBcAg. ACS treatment elevated IFN-γ level in mice serum and increased CD4 T cell percentage in splenocytes. KEGG pathway analysis showed that phenylalanine metabolism pathway and tyrosine metabolism pathway were greatly regulated by ACS treatment.ACS exerted potent inhibitory effects on HBV replication both in vivo and in vitro, which may provide basis for its potential clinical usage.Copyright © 2019.

Its more severe type, namely nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may result in the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD, and especially NASH, are also associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) predisposes to NAFLD development and progression via insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. It has also been reported that the majority of T2DM patients have NAFLD/NASH, thus potentially further increasing their cardiometabolic risk. Current guidelines recommend to screen for NAFLD in all T2DM patients and vice-versa. Lifestyle remains the first-line therapeutic option for NAFLD/NASH. Among antidiabetic drugs, pioglitazone was shown to improve histological features of NASH. More recently, there is an increasing interest regarding the effects of newer anti-diabetic drugs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), sodium glucose cotransporter  inhibitors (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on NAFLD/NASH. The present narrative review considers the up-to-date data on the impact of DPP-4i, SGLT2i, and GLP-1 RAs on biochemical and/or histological markers of NAFLD/NASH. The potential clinical implications of these findings in daily practice are also discussed. Taking into consideration the global increasing prevalence of NAFLD/NASH, therapeutic options that can prevent or treat this disease will exert considerable benefits on human health.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Pin1 interacts with the motif containing phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro of substrates and enhances cis-trans isomerization of peptide bonds, thereby controlling the functions of these substrates. Importantly, the Pin1 expression level is highly upregulated in most cancer cells and correlates with malignant properties, and thereby with poor outcomes. In addition, Pin1 was revealed to promote the functions of multiple oncogenes and to abrogate tumor suppressors. Accordingly, Pin1 is well recognized as a master regulator of malignant processes. Recent studies have shown that Pin1 also binds to a variety of metabolic regulators, such as AMP-activated protein kinase, acetyl CoA carboxylase and pyruvate kinase2, indicating Pin1 to have major impacts on lipid and glucose metabolism in cancer cells. In this review, we focus on the roles of Pin1 in metabolic reprogramming, such as "Warburg effects", of cancer cells.

High rates of mortality and tissue damage have been reported in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis. Bovine lactoferrin (BLF) is a well-known 80-kDa glycoprotein in the transferrin family that inhibits sepsis in low-birth-weight neonates. The present study investigated the protective effects of BLF in a rat model of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). The wet/dry ratio, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant markers, total protein, total cell count, inflammatory markers and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels were assessed. Histopathological analysis was also carried out. BLF treatment reduced the wet/dry ratio of lung tissue by 30.7% and 61.3%, and lipid peroxidation by 22.3% and 67%, at concentrations of 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) and catalase were increased by more than 50% under treatment with 200 mg/kg BLF. Inflammatory markers, neutrophils, lymphocytes and total cell count were reduced by more than 50% under treatment with 200 mg/kg BLF. BLF treatment significantly reduced MPO activity, by 28.% and 74.3%, at concentrations of 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Neutrophilic infiltration and edema were observed in control rats.

Quercetin is known for its anti-allergic properties but its effects on conjunctivitis are less well understood.In this study, we evaluated the anti-allergic effects of quercetin in animal models of conjunctivitis, and explored its molecular mechanism(s) of action in cultured human mast cells (MCs).Quercetin inhibited the ovalbumin (OVA) induced expression of IgE, HA, IL-4, TNF-α and substance-P in the peripheral blood of AC mouse models. Quercetin also attenuated OVA induced MC degranulation, eosinophil number, substance P concentrations, and mRNA IL-4/TNF-α expression in the conjunctival tissue of AC models. In vitro analysis showed that quercetin reduced DNP-HSA/IgE induced calcium (Ca2+) influx, and suppressed degranulation and chemokine release in LAD2 cells (human primary mast cell). Quercetin also inhibited DNP-HSA/IgE induced Lyn/PLCγ/IP3R-Ca2+ activation, Lyn/ERK1/ signaling, and Lyn/NF-κB activation in LAD2 cells, all of which promote . When added alone, quercetin had no effect on PLCγ1 phosphorylation or expression, but potently inhibited Lyn and phosphorylation-Lyn. Quercetin (200 μM) and Lyn inhibitors (Bafetinib, 10 μM) inhibit the activity of Lyn kinase, and quercetin can reduce the activation of Lyn kinase by Lyn agonist (Tolimidone, 10 μM). These data can be preliminarily determined that quercetin can inhibit allergic conjunctivitis as a Lyn kinase inhibitor.This study illustrated the use of quercetin for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis, which might act through its ability to inhibit Lyn/PLCγ/IP3R-Ca, Lyn/ERK1/, and Lyn/NF-κB signaling.

The patients are followed-up for 6 months. The primary endpoint is the myocardial salvage index measured by cardiac MRI (CMR) 3-7 days after the intervention. Secondary endpoints include final infarct size measured by CMR and plasma markers of myocardial necrosis. Efficacy and safety assessments during follow-up include blood sampling, echocardiography and CMR.Based on previous experience the study is considered feasible and safe.

Despite many studies on AR therapy, the drugs of treatment for AR remain limited in effect. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the effects of saikosaponin A (SSA) on nasal , T helper (Th) and Th17 cytokines, retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor (ROR)-γt, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3, and nuclear factor (NF)-κB signalings in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced AR mice model. OVA-induced AR mice exhibited increase in nasal symptoms, histological alteration, OVA-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E/IgG1, ROR-γt, STAT3 and NF-κB signalings. However, the administration of SSA significantly decreased allergic symptoms including nasal rubbing and sneezing. Additionally, histological alterations such as mucosa layer thickness, goblet cell hyperplasia, eosinophils and mast cell infiltration in nasal tissues dramatically improved by treatment with SSA. Also, SSA treatment decreased the levels of OVA-specific IgE/IgG in serum and the levels of Th2 and Th17 cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-17 in nasal lavage fluid (NALF). Moreover, SSA inhibited the activation of transcription factor ROR-γt, STAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 in both NALF and lung. Futher, SSA could also significantly inhibit the expressions of NF-κB p65 and phosphorylated NF-κB p65 in NALF and lung. These present results suggested that SSA may attenuate OVA-induced allergic rhinitis through regulating the expression of IL-6/ROR-γt/STAT3/IL-17/NF-κB signaling. The results indicate that SSA may be used as a therapeutic candidate for allergic rhinitis disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The ischemia model was established by infusion of endothelin-1 (ET-1) into the animal's hippocampus using stereotaxic surgery. Physical, cognitive and combination training groups exposed to voluntary running wheel exercise or modified Barnes maze cognitive task or combination of this interventions for 4 weeks, respectively. Next, Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition (NOR) tasks were used to assess recognition and spatial learning and memories. Western blotting was used to evaluate the protein levels of Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor 1 (TNFR1), cytochrome c, Bcl--associated X protein (Bax), B-cell lymphoma  (Bcl-), and cleaved caspase-3 in the hippocampal tissue. Hippocampal ischemia significantly impaired recognition and spatial learning and memory with an increase of inflammatory and apoptotic proteins in the hippocampus tissue. Interventions in combination or separately significantly improved performance of ischemia-received animals in memory tasks. Furthermore, both physical and cognitive paradigms also reduced inflammatory and apoptotic factors in the hippocampus of ischemia-received rats. These findings indicate that physical and cognitive training separately or in combination attenuates the deleterious effect of ischemia on cognition through its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties.Copyright © 2019.

Biosynthesized gold nanoparticles are the ideal alternatives spotlighted by many researchers to treat various diseases. In the present study we synthesized gold nanoparticles using the root extract of Paeonia mountan, woody trees which are used in traditional Chinese medicine to be prescribed for diverse diseases. The synthesis of gold nanoparticles was confirmed with UV-Vis spectroscopic analysis and characterized using FTIR, HR-TEM, EDAX and XRD analysis. The cytotoxicity property of synthesized gold nanoparticles was assessed using MTT assay in the murine microglial BV2 cells. The neuroprotective effect of synthesized gold nanoparticles in inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharides triggered murine microglial BV2 cells was evaluated using nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2 and inflammatory cytokines assays such as IL-6&IL-1β. Further to confirm in vivo effect of synthesized nanoparticles, the nanoparticles were treated to Parkinson induced C57BL/6 mice. Behavioral, biochemical and molecular analysis were performed to estimate the potency of synthesized gold nanoparticles against the Parkinson induction in mice model. Our characterization results prove the gold nanoparticles synthesized using Paeonia mountan fulfills the requirement of ideal nanodrug and it potentially inhibited the  in in vitro murine microglial BV2.

The anti-inflammatory effects of baicalin have been proposed in a mouse model of experimental sepsis. Here, we investigated its protective effects and associated mechanisms with respect to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced injury in Caenorhabditis elegans.Worms were stimulated by LPS (100 μg/mL), with baicalin (1, 10, 100 μmol/L), for 24 h. Animal survival rates and behaviors (reversal and omega turn) were then determined. Further, levels of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Western blotting was also performed to determine the protein expression levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), Bax, and Bcl-. The activities of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) contents were determined using corresponding kits.Baicalin (10, 100 μmol/L) improved LPS-stimulated C. elegans survival and rescued behavioral phenotypes. It also suppressed the oxidative stress related to LPS injury by decreasing MDA levels and increasing SOD activity. Moreover, the inflammatory response was inhibited as evidenced by decreased levels of cytokines including IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-α. In addition, baicalin treatment significantly decreased cleaved Bax levels and increased Bcl- expression in C. elegans treated with LPS. Simultaneously, the expression of NF-κB and TLR4 was significantly decreased.Baicalin treatment protects against LPS-induced injury by decreasing oxidative stress, repressing the inflammatory cascade, and inhibiting apoptosis.© 2019 S.

In this study, we aim to investigate whether L-Arabinose could inhibit colitis by modulating gut microbiota. L-Arabinose was administrated in mice daily in a DSS-induced colitis model. The histological analysis, disease index and the expression of inflammatory genes were measured. 16S-rRNA sequence analysis was performed to investigate gut microbiota. Intriguingly, we found that L-Arabinose could repress DSS-induced colitis and inhibit p38-/p65-dependent  activation. Besides that, our data revealed that L-Arabinose modulated gut microbiota disturbed by DSS treatment. Additionally, by antibiotic treatment, the perturbed gut microbiota was responsible for the suppressive effects of L-Arabinose on DSS-induced colitis. Lastly, Caco- cells was used to confirm the protective effects of L-Arabinose. As expected, the expression levels of pro-inflammatory proteins in Caco- cells treated with L-Arabinose in absence or presence of TNFα. Our work suggested that L-Arabinose exert anti- effect in DSS-induced colitis. These beneficial effects may be related to the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota regulated by L-Arabinose.

However, interest in functional verification and industrial applications of sericin has been growing for several years. We used ultrasonication to simplify the extraction process of the silk peptide under low salt conditions at 20 °C, instead of using the conventional conditions of high salt and temperature. The concentration of the silk peptide was measured to determine the optimized extraction time and solvent, which were 4 h and 0.1 N NaOH, respectively. The molecular weight of the enzyme-treated silk peptide was measured using SDS-PAGE and GPC. Silk peptide treated with papain after ultrasound had a molecular weight of less than 5 kDa, and the papain treated-silk peptide reduced solar ultraviolet-induced COX- expression through inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. This is the first study investigating simultaneous extraction of fibroin and sericin, which can be used for mass production of food materials.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Despite extensive research in animal models and numerous promising treatment trials, there is still no curative treatment for AD. Astrocytes, the most common cell type of the central nervous system, have been shown to play a role in the major AD pathologies, including accumulation of amyloid plaques, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Here, we show that inflammatory stimulation leads to metabolic activation of human astrocytes and reduces amyloid secretion. On the other hand, the activation of oxidative metabolism leads to increased reactive oxygen species production especially in AD astrocytes. While healthy astrocytes increase glutathione (GSH) release to protect the cells, Presenilin-1-mutated AD patient astrocytes do not. Thus, chronic  is likely to induce oxidative damage in AD astrocytes. Activation of NRF2, the major regulator of cellular antioxidant defenses, encoded by the NFE2L2 gene, poses several beneficial effects on AD astrocytes. We report here that the activation of NRF2 pathway reduces amyloid secretion, normalizes cytokine release, and increases GSH secretion in AD astrocytes. NRF2 induction also activates the metabolism of astrocytes and increases the utilization of glycolysis. Taken together, targeting NRF2 in astrocytes could be a potent therapeutic strategy in AD.© 2019 The Authors.

Severe bacterial infections causing sepsis always result in profound physiological changes, including fever, hypotension, arrhythmia, necrosis of tissue, systemic multi-organ dysfunction and finally death. LPS challenge-induced inflammatory responses during sepsis may increase the likelihood of the arrhythmogenesis. Lemnalol is known to possess potent anti-inflammatory effects. This study examined whether Lemnalol (0.1 μM) could modulate the electrophysiological characteristics and calcium homeostasis of atrial myocytes under the influence of LPS (1μg/mL). Under challenge with LPS, Lemnalol-treated LA myocytes, had a longer AP duration at 20%, 50% and 90% repolarization of the amplitude, compared to the LPS-treated cells. LPS-challenged LA myocytes showed increased late sodium current, Na-Ca exchanger current, transient outward current, rapid component of delayed rectifier potassium current, tumor necrosis factor-α, NF-κB and increased phosphorylation of ryanodine receptor (RyR), but a lower L-type Ca current than the control LA myocytes. Exposure to Lemnalol reversed the LPS-induced effects. The LPS-treated and control groups of LA myocytes, with or without the existence of Lemnalol. showed no apparent alterations in the sodium current amplitude or Cav1. expression. The expression of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium transport ATPase (SERCA2) was reduced by LPS treatment, while Lemnalol ameliorated the LPS-induced alterations. The phosphorylation of RyR was enhanced by LPS treatment, while Lemnalol attenuated the LPS-induced alterations. In conclusion, Lemnalol modulates LPS-induced alterations of LA calcium homeostasis and blocks the NF-κB pathways, which may contribute to the attenuation of LPS-induced arrhythmogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665264>, but Not the Underlying Disease or Its Location, Predicts Oral Iron Absorption Capacity in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Anaemia is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], its two main aetiologies being iron deficiency anaemia [IDA] and anaemia of chronic  [ACI]. Impaired intestinal iron absorption due to inflammatory cytokines is thought to play a role in ACI. We undertook for the first time a controlled prospective study investigating effects of differing underlying diseases, disease locations, and types of iron deficiency or anaemia on oral iron absorption in adult IBD patients with and without .This study was a comparative, single-centred open clinical trial in adults with IBD [n = 73] and healthy controls [n = 22]. Baseline parameters included blood count, iron status [ferritin, transferrin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, hepcidin, serum iron], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP] and interleukin-6. Iron absorption was tested using one oral, enteric-coated capsule containing 567.7 mg iron[II]-glycine-sulphate complex. Serum iron was determined 60/90/120/180/240 min after ingestion.Iron absorption capacity was shown to be influenced by  and anaemia or iron deficiency [ID] type but not by underlying disease type or localisation. The ACI group showed a significantly lower iron absorption capacity than all others. Whereas hsCRP levels [-0.387, p < 0.001], IL-6 [-0.331, p = 0.006], ferritin [-0.531, p < 0.001], and serum hepcidin [-0.353, p = 0.003] correlated negatively with serum iron change at  h, transferrin showed a positive correlation at the same time point [0.379, p < 0.001].Underlying disease type and localisation appear to have little effect on iron absorption capacity, whereas lack of response to oral iron correlates well with serum markers of .

Although a large number of irreversible-acting MAGL inhibitors have been discovered over the past years, there are only few compounds known so far which inhibit the enzyme in a reversible manner. Therefore, much effort is put into the development of novel chemical entities showing reversible inhibitory behavior, which is thought to cause less undesired side effects. To explore a wide range of chemical structures as MAGL binders, we have applied a virtual screening approach by docking small molecules into the crystal structure of human MAGL (hMAGL) and envisaged a library of 45 selected compounds which were then synthesized. Biochemical investigations included the determination of the inhibitory potency on hMAGL and two related hydrolases, i.e. human fatty acid amide hydrolase (hFAAH) and murine cholesterol esterase (mCEase). The most promising candidates from theses analyses, i.e. three ω-quinazolinonylalkyl aryl ureas bearing alkyl spacers of three to five methylene groups, exhibited IC values of 20-41 µM and reversible, detergent-insensitive behavior towards hMAGL. Among these compounds, the inhibitor 1-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-3-(4-(4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolin--yl)butyl)urea (96) was selected for further kinetic characterization, yielding a dissociation constant K = 15.4 µM and a mixed-type inhibition with a pronounced competitive component (α = 8.94). This mode of inhibition was further supported by a docking experiment, which suggested that the inhibitor occupies the substrate binding pocket of hMAGL.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, recent studies have suggested that they display isoform-specific roles in muscle and fat. To determine whether such isoform-specificity is observed with respect to alcoholic liver disease (ALD) progression, we examined the role of Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 in hepatic , and pro-fibrogenic proliferation and migration using Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells (HSC), and hepatocytes in an ethanol and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced two-hit model in vitro and in vivo. We determined that siRNA-directed silencing of Akt2, but not Akt1, significantly suppressed cell inflammatory markers in HSC and Kupffer cells. Although both Akt1 and Akt2 inhibited cell proliferation in HSC, only Akt2 inhibited cell migration. Both Akt1 and Akt2, but not Akt3, inhibited fibrogenesis in hepatocytes and HSC. In addition, our in vivo results show that administration of chronic ethanol, binge ethanol and LPS (EBL) in wild-type C57BL/6 mice activated all three Akt isoforms with concomitant increases in activated forms of phosphoinositide dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), mammalian target-of-rapamycin complex  (mTORC2), and PI3K, resulting in upregulation in expression of inflammatory, proliferative, and fibrogenic genes. Moreover, pharmacological blocking of Akt2, but not Akt1, inhibited EBL-induced  while blocking of both Akt1 and Akt2 inhibited pro-fibrogenic marker expression and progression of fibrosis. Our findings indicate that Akt isoforms play unique roles in , cell proliferation, migration, and fibrogenesis during EBL-induced liver injury.

Most epidemiological evidence on the association between BPA and diabetes is from cross-sectional studies or longitudinal studies with single urinary measurements. No prospective study has examined exposure to BPA analogs such as bisphenol S (BPS) in relation to incident type  diabetes.We aimed to investigate whether exposure to BPA and BPS, assessed at up to two time points, was associated with the incidence of type  diabetes.We performed a case-cohort study on 755 participants without diabetes at baseline and followed-up over 9 y as part of the French prospective cohort Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome (D.E.S.I.R.). BPA-glucuronide (BPA-G) and BPS-glucuronide (BPS-G) were assessed in fasting spot urine samples collected during the health examinations at baseline and 3 y later. Associations with incident diabetes were examined using Prentice-weighted Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders.A total of 201 incident cases of type  diabetes were diagnosed over the follow-up, including 30 in the subcohort. Compared with participants with the lowest average BPA exposure (below the first quartile), participants in the second, third, and fourth quartile groups of exposure had a near doubling of the risk of type  diabetes, with a hazard ratio  .56 (95% CI: 1.16, 5.65), .35 (95% CI: 1.07, 5.15), and 1.56 (95% CI: 0.68, 3.55), respectively. The detection of BPS-G in urine at one or both time points was associated with incident diabetes, with an  .81 (95% CI: 1.74, 4.53).This study shows positive associations between exposure to BPA and BPS and the incidence of type  diabetes, independent of traditional diabetes risk factors. Our results should be confirmed by recent, population-based observational studies in different populations and settings. Overall, these findings raise concerns about using BPS as a BPA substitute.

This study aimed to evaluate supplemental effects of dietary nucleotides on intestinal health and growth performance in newly weaned pigs. Fifty newly weaned pigs (19-d-old, 25 barrows and 25 gilts, 4.76 ± 0.42 kg BW) were individually housed and allotted to 5 treatments with increasing nucleotide supplementation (0, 50, 150, 250, and 500 mg/kg) based on a randomized complete block design with the initial BW and sex as blocks. Dietary nucleotides were provided from YT500 (Hinabiotech, Guangzhou, China). Pigs were fed for 21 d based on  phases (Phase 1: 11 d and Phase : 10 d) and experimental diets were formulated to meet or exceed nutrient requirements suggested by NRC (2012). Feed intake and BW were recorded. Titanium oxide (0.4%) was added as an indigestible marker from d 17. Plasma collected on d 18 was used to measure tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Pigs were euthanized on d 21 to collect tissues to evaluate TNF-α, IL-6, MDA, morphology, and crypt cell proliferation rate in the jejunum. Ileal digesta were collected to measure ileal nutrient digestibility. Data were analyzed using contrasts in the MIXED procedure of SAS. Nucleotide supplementation increased (P < 0.05) ADFI in phase 1. Nucleotide supplementation at 50 and 150 mg/kg increased (P < 0.05) ADG in Phase 1, whereas increased (P < 0.05) ADFI and tended to increase (P = 0.082) ADG in overall. Increasing nucleotide supplementation changed (quadratic, P < 0.05) villus height-crypt ratio (at 247 mg/kg) and decreased (linear, P < 0.05) crypt cell proliferation rate in the jejunum. Increasing nucleotide supplementation reduced (P < 0.05) jejunal IL-6 (at 50 and 150 mg/kg) and tended to change (quadratic, P = 0.074) plasma MDA (at 231 mg/kg). Nucleotide supplementation at 50 and 150 mg/kg increased (P < 0.05) ileal digestibility of energy and ether extract. In conclusion, nucleotide supplementation at a range of 50 to 250 mg/kg in the diets seems to be beneficial to newly weaned pigs by enhancing growth performance possibly due to reduced intestinal  and oxidative stress as well as improved intestinal villi structure and energy digestibility.© The Author(s) 2019.

Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type  diabetes, in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and insulin-mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human obesity, and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte metabolism. In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed 5-fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in obesity, reduced levels after surgery-induced weight loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate measures of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte ipolysis and insulin signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.5--fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in obesity and insulin resistance, which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We also found that TNF-α-enhanced protein expressions of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB translocation were synergistically reduced by the combined curcumin and luteolin in EA.hy 926 cells while the individual chemical did not have this inhibitory effect. Consistently,  weeks dietary intake of combined curcumin (500 mg/kg) and luteolin (500 mg/kg) in C57BL/6 mice synergistically prevented TNF-α-stimulated adhesion of mouse monocytes to aortic endothelium ex vivo as well as the TNF-α-increased aortic protein expression of MCP-1 and VCAM-1. Therefore, combined curcumin and luteolin at physiological concentrations synergistically inhibits TNF-α-induced monocytes adhesion to endothelial cells and expressions of MCP-1 and VCAM-1 via suppressing NF-κB translocation into the nucleus.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The chemical-induction of hepatocarcinogenesis was performed by injection of DEN intraperitoneally at 150 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) twice/week for two weeks, followed by oral administration of 2AAF at 20 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) twice/week for two weeks. The DEN/2AAF-administered rats were co-treated with quercetin and naringenin at dose level of 10 mg/kg b. w. by oral gavage for 20 weeks. The treatment of DEN/2AAF-administered rats with quercetin and naringenin significantly prevented the elevations in serum levels of liver function indicators (ALT, AST, ALP, γ-GT, total bilirubin and albumin) and liver tumor biomarkers including AFP, CEA and CA19.9. The cancerous histological lesions and inflammatory cells infiltration in liver of DEN/2AAF-administered rats were remarkably suppressed by treatments with quercetin and naringenin. The hepatic oxidative stress markers including NO level and lipid peroxidation significantly decreased while the SOD, GPx and CAT activities and GSH content significantly increased in DEN/2AAF-administered rats treated with quercetin and naringenin when compared to DEN/2AFF-administered control rats. Furthermore, the lowered mRNA expression of liver IL-4, P53 and Bcl- in of DEN/2AAF-administered rats were significantly counteracted by treatment with quercetin and naringenin.

LSM was compared in patients with normal total bilirubin (TB) versus abnormal TB for each group of fibrosis stage, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and  grade. Logistic regression and ROC analyses were performed to assess the benefit of adding TB and to LSM for fibrosis staging.Nine hundred and seventy-three patients were analyzed. Within the same fibrosis stage, LSMs showed significantly higher value in patients with abnormal TB than those with normal TB. Increased LSM for abnormal TB was generally found within different sub-groups of patients (≤ F2 or ≥ F3; ALT <  × upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT ≥  × ULN; METAVIR activity grade ≤ 1 or ≥ ). Patients with abnormal TB level showed higher optimal cutoff values: 10.46 kPa for ≥ F2, 10.94 kPa for ≥ F3, and 15.88 kPa for F4, than those with normal TB (7.62 kPa, 8.26 kPa, and 11.01 kPa, respectively). LSM assessed fibrosis stage (≥ F2, ≥ F3, F4) showed higher false positive rate in patients with abnormal TB level (44.6%, 45.1%, 39.6%) than those with normal TB (20.7%, 17.1%, 14.4%). However, the area under the ROC curve did not change appreciably when adding TB to LSM for fibrosis stage.Intrahepatic cholestasis showed slight effect on LSM in patients with CHB, also leading to overestimation of liver fibrosis stages. But adding TB level to LSM did not improve the overall diagnostic performance of liver fibrosis stage.• Intrahepatic cholestasis showed slight effect on liver stiffness measurements (LSMs) in chronic HBV patients. • Patients with abnormal total bilirubin (TB) level showed higher optimal cutoff values and false positive rate. • When taking into account intrahepatic cholestasis, the diagnostic performance of LSM for liver fibrosis staging in patients with chronic HBV infection will not improve.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675274>Relevant Features in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Determined Using Machine Learning for Feature Selection.</a></h2><p> We investigated the prevalence and the most relevant features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, (NAFLD) in which the  of hepatocytes can lead to increased cardiovascular risk, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and the need for liver transplant.

However, the role of eicosanoids in tuberculosis remains controversial. To investigate the specific role of LTB in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, we used 5-lipoxygenase-deficient (5-LO) mice and WT (sv129) mice inoculated intranasally with LTB (encapsulated in PLGA microspheres). We showed that deficiency of the 5-LO pathway was related to resistance to Mtb infection. LTB inoculation increased susceptibility to Mtb in 5-LO mice but not in WT mice, resulting in worsening of lung  and tissue damage. In infected WT mice, most supplementary LTB was metabolized to the inactive form 12-oxo-LTB in the lung. A high amount of PGE was detected during Mtb infection, and pharmacological inhibition of COX- induced a significant reduction of bacterial load and an improved innate immune response in the lungs, independently of baseline LTB levels. COX- inhibition with celecoxib significantly reduced PGE levels, enhanced IFN-γ production and NO release, and increased macrophage phagocytosis of Mtb. The results suggest that a balance between PGE/LTB is essential in the pathogenesis process of tuberculosis to prevent severe . Moreover, optimal levels of PGE are required to induce an effective innate response in the early phase of Mtb infection. Thus, pharmacological modulation of eicosanoid production may provide an important host-directed therapy in tuberculosis.Copyright © 2019.

The amnion is the strength component of FM and must weaken for FM to rupture. It is unclear whether GM-CSF weakens amnion (AM) directly, or initially targets choriodecidua (CD) which secondarily releases agents to act on amnion.Full thickness FM fragments were treated with/without GM-CSF. Some were preincubated with alpha-lipoic acid (LA), a known inhibitor of FM weakening. The FM fragments were then strength-tested. Separately, FM fragments were initially separated to AM and CD. AM fragments were cultured with Medium ± GM-CSF and then strength-tested. In other experiments, CD fragments were cultured with Medium, GM-CSF, LA, or LA + GM-CSF. Conditioned medium from each group was then incubated with AM. AM was then strength-tested. Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) and Tissue Inhibitors of Matrix Metalloproteinases (TIMPs) were analyzed by Mutiplex Elisa.GM-CSF weakened intact FM which was blocked by LA. GM-CSF did not weaken isolated AM. However, GM-CSF conditioned CD media weakened AM and this weakening was inhibited by LA. GM-CSF treatment of CD increased MMPs , 9, and 10, and decreased TIMPs 1-3.

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and bisphenols (A [BPA], Tetrabromobisphenol A [TBBPA], and ,4,6-Tribromophenol [TBP]) are common environmental pollutants known to increase the risk for spontaneous preterm birth (PTB). We hypothesized that placental exposure to these environmental pollutants causes exosome cargo changes that reflect exposure associated placental response.Full-term, C-section placenta explants were treated with PBDE congeners (47, 100, 153, 209), TBBPA, TBP or BPA for 24 h. Exosomes were isolated from media by sequential ultracentrifugation and purified by size exclusion chromatography. Exosomes were characterized by electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and Western blot. Proteomics identified differentially expressed exosomal proteins and Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) determined biological functions and pathways represented by identified proteins.Regardless of treatment, placental expressed exosomes markers (PLAP, CD9, CD63, 81 and ALIX), had a size distribution between 50 and 175 nm and were present in the conditioned medium at 5-8 x 10 exosomes/mL. Proteomic analysis identified 2598 proteins which demonstrated that specific pollutants caused differential expression of specific proteins, including alarmin, High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1), MAPK14 (p38 MAPK) and GSK3β.

However, the cause of reduced myometrial P4 responsiveness that promotes contractions at labour is not fully determined. Uterine stretch occurs with advancing gestation but most in vitro experimental models do not take this into consideration. We aimed to examine whether tissue-level myometrial stretch influences the ability of P4 to regulate pro-labour protein abundance by using myometrial biopsies from term gestation pregnant women to assess the impact of 24 h exposure to combinations of (i) stretch-mediated tension, (ii) P4 (100 nM) and (iii) an anti-progestin, RU-486 (1 μM). Firstly, we observed baseline COX- and Cx43 protein levels increased, whereas P4 content along with calponin-1 and progesterone receptor (PR) protein abundance decreased, in vehicle-treated tissues. P4 supplementation subtly reduced COX- levels in un-stretched tissues. Spontaneous and oxytocin-augmented contractility were unchanged by tissue culture exposure to P4 and/or RU-486. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β; 1 ng/ml) enhanced COX- protein and PGE content in un-stretched tissues. Overall, tissue stretch may, in part, regulate P4-sensitive pro-labour protein levels, but this is likely to be reliant on interaction with other in utero factors that were absent in our tissue cultures. More complex culture conditions should be evaluated in future to aid further development of a physiologically relevant model to improve our understanding of in utero myometrial P4 responsiveness.Copyright © 2019.

This lack of benefit has been attributed to closure methods of the defect, with subsequent spinal cord tethering at the repair site. Hence, a regenerative patch or material with antiinflammatory and anti-scarring properties may alleviate comorbidities with improved outcomes. The authors' primary objective was therefore to compare cryopreserved human umbilical cord (HUC) versus acellular dermal matrix (ADM) patches for regenerative repair of in utero SB lesions in an animal model.In vivo studies were conducted in retinoic acid-induced SB defects in fetuses of Sprague-Dawley rats. HUC or ADM patches were sutured over the SB defects at a gestational age of 20 days. Repaired SB defect tissues were harvested after 48-52 hours. Tissue sections were immunofluorescently stained for the presence of neutrophils, macrophages, keratinocytes, meningeal cells, and astrocytes and for any associated apoptosis. In vitro meningeal or keratinocyte cell coculture experiments with the ADM and HUC patches were performed. All experiments were scored quantitatively in a blinded manner.Neutrophil counts and apoptotic cells were lower in the HUC-based repair group (n = 8) than in the ADM patch repair group (n = 7). In the HUC patch repair group, keratinocytes were present on the outer surface of the patch, meningeal cells were present on the inner surface of the patch adjacent to the neural placode, and astrocytes were noted to be absent. In the ADM patch repair group, all 3 cell types were present on both surfaces of the patch. In vitro studies showed that human meningeal cells grew preferentially on the mesenchymal side of the HUC patch, whereas keratinocytes showed tropism for the epithelial side, suggesting an inherent HUC-based cell polarity. In contrast, the ADM patch studies showed no polarity and decreased cellular infiltration.The HUC patch demonstrated reduced acute  and apoptosis together with superior organization in regenerative cellular growth when compared with the ADM patch, and is therefore likely the better patch material for in utero SB defect repair. These properties may make the HUC biomaterial useful as a "meningeal patch" during spinal cord surgeries, thereby potentially reducing tethering and improving on spinal cord function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668752>Age-related metabolic changes of pre-weaned Simmental calves fed whole bulk milk and ad libitum calf starter.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to investigate blood biomarkers encompassing the metabolic status of Simmental calves, with emphasis on weekly differences in the pre-weaning period. Ten Italian Simmental calves were used for the experiment and were offered 6 L of bulk whole milk/d from an open-bucket starting at day  from birth and through 5 weeks. Blood samples were collected at birth and weekly to assess biochemical indicators related to energy metabolism and liver function, minerals, markers of , and oxidative stress. Body weight (BW), heart girth (HG), and solid feed intake were positively affected by aging. Calves increased solid feed intake consumption after  week and reached a BW gain of 28.16 kg at 5 weeks. Most of blood biomarkers were affected by age, mostly concerned the period after birth and day 1, whereas no changes were observed for haptoglobin, urea, β-hydroxybutyrate, Na, and K. The amount of milk fed to calves throughout this study contributes to the maintenance of glucose concentration over time, coupled also with a considerable amount of starter intake. Glucose levels associated to the high ADG (0.89 ± 0.09 kg/d, mean ± SEM) suggest that calves experienced a positive energy balance throughout the entire pre-weaning period. Similar levels of haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin, together with a gradual increase of albumin, reflect good liver functionality and a stable condition regarding the inflammatory status. These results suggest that blood biomarkers of Simmental calves in the pre-weaning phase vary with growing stages.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the effects of salt on monocytes and macrophages in vitro and in vivo by performing a randomized crossover trial in which 11 healthy human subjects adhered to a -week low-salt and high-salt diet. We demonstrate that salt increases monocyte expression of CCR2, a chemokine receptor that mediates monocyte infiltration in inflammatory diseases. In line with this, we show a salt-induced increase of plasma MCP-1, transendothelial migration of monocytes, and skin macrophage density after high-salt diet. Macrophages demonstrate signs of an increased proinflammatory phenotype after salt exposure, as represented by boosted LPS-induced cytokine secretion of IL-6, TNF, and IL-10 in vitro, and by increased HLA-DR expression and decreased CD206 expression on skin macrophages after high-salt diet.

In the study, we investigated the effect of aqueous extract of FC (FC-AE) and elucidated its mechanism in non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells and a xenograft model of nude mice.CCK-8 and plate colony formation assay were used to evaluate the effect of FC-AE in A549 cells in vitro, and the gene expression profile of FC-AE on A549 cells was assessed by RNA sequencing system. Then, the effects of FC-AE on cell cycle and apoptosis of A549 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. In combination with RNA-seq data, RT-PCR and western blot were used to evaluate the expression of proteins related to apoptosis and immune regulation. A xenograft model of nude mice was used to assess the effect of FC-AE in vivo.CCK-8 and plate cloning assays showed that FC-AE inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of A549 cells. A549 cells treated with FC-AE can triggered apoptosis. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of RNA-seq data showed that most of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were related to immune response, apoptosis and cell cycle process. Several immune and apoptotic DEGs were identified by qRT-PCR which were consistented with RNA-seq data. In nude mice, FC-AE reduced the tumor size and promoted the secretion of cytokines IL12 and IFNγ. FC-AE up-regulated the two members (STAT1 and STAT4) of STATs and their target genes (IFNγ and IL-12, respectively) protein expressions, and actively regulates Bcl-/Bax family proteins which resulted in cellular apoptosis in A549 cells.Our finding suggests that FC-AE mediates apoptosis through a STAT1 and STAT4-mediated co-regulatory network, which may be the key novel mechanism for its antitumor activity. The F. cirrhosa may be a promising antitumor drug for modulating immune responses to improve cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019.

The role of miR-10a-5p was further investigated in cell culture, and in adipose tissue remodeling induced by CL treatment and high fat feeding.Macrophage-specific deletion of Dicer elevated pro-inflammatory gene expression and prevented CL-induced de novo beige adipogenesis in gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT). Co-culture of ASCs with ATMs of wild type mice promoted brown adipocyte gene expression upon differentiation, but co-culture with ATMs of Dicer KO mice did not. Bioinformatic analysis of RNA expression profiles identified miR-10a-5p as a potential regulator of  and differentiation in ATMs and ASCs, respectively. CL treatment increased levels of miR-10a-5p in ATMs and ASCs in gWAT. Interestingly, CL treatment elevated levels of pre-mir-10a in ATMs but not in ASCs, suggesting possible transfer from ATMs to ASCs. Elevating miR-10a-5p levels inhibited proinflammatory gene expression in cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages and promoted the differentiation of C3H10T1/ cells into brown adipocytes. Furthermore, treatment with a miR-10a-5p mimic in vivo rescued CL-induced beige adipogenesis in Dicer KO mice. High fat feeding reduced miR-10a-5p levels in ATMs of gWAT, and treatment of mice with a miR-10a-5p mimic suppressed pro-inflammatory responses, promoted the appearance of new white adipocytes in gWAT, and improved systemic glucose tolerance.These results demonstrate an important role of macrophage-generated microRNAs in adipogenic niches and identify miR-10a-5p as a key regulator that reduces adipose tissue  and promotes therapeutic adipogenesis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Although Forkhead Box M1 (FoxM1) is a well-defined oncogenic transcription factor that is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its role in liver  has never been explored.We generated hepatocyte-specific FoxM1 conditional transgenic (TG) mice using the Cre-loxP and Tetracycline (Tet)-on systems to induce FoxM1 expression in a hepatocyte-specific and time-dependent manner.After treatment of Tet-derivatives doxycycline (DOX) to induce FoxM1, TG mice exhibited spontaneous development of hepatocyte death with elevated serum ALT levels and hepatic infiltration of macrophages. The removal of DOX in TG mice completely removed this effect, suggesting that spontaneous  in TG mice occurs in a hepatocyte FoxM1-dependent manner. In addition, liver  in TG mice was associated with increased levels of hepatic and serum chemokine (C-C motif) ligand  (CCL2). In vitro transcriptional analysis confirmed that CCL2 is a direct target of FoxM1 in murine hepatocytes. After receiving FoxM1 induction since birth, all TG mice exhibited spontaneous HCC with liver fibrosis at 12 months of age. Hepatic expression of FoxM1 was significantly increased in liver injury models. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of FoxM1 reduced liver  in models of liver injury.Hepatocyte FoxM1 acts as a crucial regulator to orchestrate liver  linking to hepatocarcinogenesis. Thus, hepatocyte FoxM1 may be a potential target not only for the treatment of liver injury but also for the prevention toward HCC.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Safety (March 2017 cut-off) and efficacy, including patient-reported outcomes, were evaluated.In the double-blind phase, patients receiving sarilumab or adalimumab monotherapy showed meaningful improvements in disease activity; sarilumab was superior to adalimumab for improving signs, symptoms and physical function. Overall, 320/369 patients completing the 24-week double-blind phase entered OLE (155 switched from adalimumab; 165 continued sarilumab). Sarilumab safety profile was consistent with previous reports. Treatment-emergent adverse events were similar between groups; no unexpected safety signals emerged in the first 10 weeks postswitch. Among switch patients, improvement in disease activity was evident at OLE week 12: 47.1%/34.8% had changes ≥1. in Disease Activity Score (28 joints) (DAS28)-erythrocyte sedimentation rate/DAS28-C-reactive protein. In switch patients achieving low disease activity (LDA: Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≤10; Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) ≤11) by OLE week 24, 70.7%/69.5% sustained CDAI/SDAI LDA at both OLE weeks 36 and 48. Proportions of switch patients achieving CDAI ≤.8 and SDAI ≤3.3 by OLE week 24 increased through OLE week 48. Improvements postswitch approached continuation-group values, including scores ≥normative values.During this OLE, there were no unexpected safety issues in patients switching from adalimumab to sarilumab monotherapy, and disease activity improved in many patients. Patients continuing sarilumab reported safety consistent with prolonged use and had sustained benefit.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

Univariate analysis showed that the tumor stage and grade, the presence of metastasis, white blood cell count, platelet count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and globulin were significantly associated with the disease-specific survival (all P < 0.05). At multivariate analysis, only the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio had an independent effect (hazard ratio .131; P = 0.035). The predictive accuracy of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was the best among the laboratory variables. The predictive accuracy of the basic pathological factors was significantly increased by incorporating the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio prognosticator.The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio before inguinal lymph node dissection might be useful for predicting the prognosis of patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma.© 2019 The Japanese Urological Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680288></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668052>Association between Abdominal Obesity and Oxidative Stress in Korean Adults.</a></h2><p>Obesity causes several changes in the body and is associated with both  and oxidative stress. However, the relationship between abdominal obesity, diacron-reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs), and biological antioxidant potential (BAP) levels in Korean adults has not yet been proved. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between d-ROMs, BAP levels, and abdominal obesity in the Korean adult population using clinical data.A total of ,367 individuals, aged 18-86 years, were identified from health check-up examination records at a university hospital, between January 2015 and August 2016. Clinical and biochemical parameters, including waist circumference, lipid profile, alcohol drinking status, and smoking status, were investigated. Oxidative stress levels, viz., d-ROM concentration and antioxidant capacity, viz., BAP, were measured.Subjects with abdominal obesity presented significantly higher levels of d-ROMs compared to those with a normal waist circumference (P<0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, alcohol drinking status; smoking status; and triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein levels were found to have a significant positive correlation with abdominal obesity (P<0.001). BAP did not significantly correlate with abdominal obesity.We observed a positive association between abdominal obesity and d-ROM concentration. This result indicates that abdominal obesity can increase oxidative stress and may affect the pathways involved in obesity, such as the inflammatory pathway. Such correlation analyses were helpful in revealing the causes, as well as methods to reduce, oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674692>Frontline Science: Cytokine-mediated developmental phenotype of mouse eosinophils: IL-5-associated expression of the Ly6G/Gr1 surface Ag.</a></h2><p>Eosinophils have broad and extensive immunomodulatory capacity; recent studies have focused on the roles of distinct eosinophil subsets in specific tissue microenvironments. Ly6G is a GPI-linked leukocyte surface Ag understood primarily as a marker of mouse neutrophils, although its full function is not known. Here, we show that Ly6G/Gr1, detected by mAbs 1A8 (anti-Ly6G) and RB6-8C5 (anti-Gr1), is detected prominently on a significant fraction of eosinophils from mouse bone marrow and bone marrow-derived culture, with fractions expressing this Ag increasing in IL-5-enriched microenvironments. Among our findings, we identified SiglecF Gr1 eosinophils in bone marrow from naïve, allergen-challenged and IL-5 transgenic mice; SiglecF Gr1 eosinophils were also prominent ex vivo in bone marrow-derived eosinophils (bmEos) in IL-5-enriched culture. Reducing the IL-5 concentration 20-fold had no impact on the rate of generation of SiglecF bmEos but did result in a marked increase in the Gr1 fraction (from 17.4 ± % to 30 ± .3%, ***P < 0.005). Reducing the IL-5 concentration also enhanced chemotaxis; SiglecF Gr1 bmEos were considerably more responsive to eotaxin-1 than were their SiglecF Gr1 counterparts. These results suggest that (i) IL-5 regulates the expression of Ly6G/Gr1, either directly or indirectly, in cells of the eosinophil lineage, (ii) eosinophils generated in response to high concentrations of IL-5 can be distinguished from those generated under homeostatic conditions by expression of the Ly6G/Gr1 cell surface Ag, and (iii) expression of Ly6G/Gr1 may have an impact on function, directly or indirectly, including the potential to undergo chemotaxis in response to eotaxin-1.©2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665614>Protective Effects of Olmesartan and L-carnitine on Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity in Rats.</a></h2><p>Doxorubicin (DOX), anthracycline antibiotic, is an important antineoplastic agent due to its high antitumor efficacy in hematological, as well as in solid malignancies. The present study aimed to investigate the possible protective effect of olmesartan (Olm), L-carnitine (L-CA) and their combination in cardiotoxicity induced by doxorubicin (DOX) in rats. Male albino rats were randomly divided into seven experimental groups (n=8): Group I: normal control, group II: L-CA, Group III: Olm, Group IV: DOX. The other three groups were treated with Olm (10 mg/kg), L-CA (300 mg/kg) and their combination for  weeks, after induction of cardiotoxicity by a single dose of DOX (20 mg/kg). In results, DOX showed a significant elevation in serum troponin I, CK-MB, and LDH, together with increased  manifested by the rise of TNF-α, ICAM-1, IL-1, MPO, NF-k β and TGF-β in cardiac tissues. While, DOX-induced oxidative stress by increasing in MDA and decreasing in SOD and GSH in heart tissues. In addition, caspase-3 activity was boosted as indication of increased apoptosis. On the other hand, administration of L-CA and Olm attenuated the DOX-evoked disturbances in the above mentioned parameters. In addition, DOX exhibited echocardiographic changes and severe histopathological changes, which were significantly reversed by L-CA and Olm treatment.

Sixty multiparous, pregnant lactating Holstein cows with somatic cell count <200,000/mL were blocked by days in milk and milk yield and randomly assigned to receive a daily top-dressed dietary supplement containing 1 or 3 mg of vitamin D (1mgD or 3mgD), or 1 or 3 mg 25(OH)D (1mg25D or 3mg25D) for 28 d (n = 15/treatment). Cows were kept in a freestall barn and fed a total mixed ration in individual feeding gates. Individual dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield were recorded daily, and milk and blood samples were collected at 0, 7, 14, and 21 d relative to the start of treatment. At 21 d, cows fed 1mgD and 3mg25D received an intramammary challenge with Streptococcus uberis. Cows were observed for severity of mastitis, and blood and milk samples were collected every 12 h to measure . The 1mg25D and 3mg25D cows had greater serum 25(OH)D concentrations at 21 d compared with 1mgD and 3mgD cows (62 ± 7, 66 ± 8, 135 ± 15, and 232 ± 26 ng/mL for 1mgD, 3mgD, 1mg25D, and 3mg25D, respectively). The 3mg25D cows had greater concentrations of Ca and P in serum at 21 d compared with other treatments (Ca = .38, .4, .37, and .48 ± 0.02 mM, 1.87, 1.88, and .10 ± 0.08 mM for 1mgD, 3mgD, 1mg25D, and 3mg25D, respectively). Yields of milk and milk components, DMI, body weight, and concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and Mg in serum did not differ among treatments. Abundance of mRNA transcripts for interleukin-1β (IL1β) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in milk somatic cells before S. uberis challenge were increased in cows fed 25(OH)D compared with cows fed vitamin D. Furthermore, IL1β, iNOS, β-defensin 7, and β-defensin 10 in milk somatic cells increased as concentrations of 25(OH)D increased in serum. Cows fed 3mg25D had less severe mastitis at 60 and 72 h after challenge with S. uberis compared with cows fed 1mgD. Concentrations of bacteria, somatic cells, and serum albumin in milk after challenge did not differ between treatments; however, an interaction between treatment and day was detected for lactate dehydrogenase in milk. Expression of adhesion protein CD11b on milk neutrophils after the S. uberis challenge was greater among 3mg25D cows compared with 1mgD cows. Transcripts of CYP24A1 and iNOS in milk somatic cells during mastitis also were greater in 3mg25D cows compared with 1mgD cows. Feeding 25(OH)D increased serum 25(OH)D more effectively than supplemental vitamin D, resulting in increased serum mineral concentrations, increased expression of vitamin D-responsive genes, and altered immune responses to intramammary bacterial challenge.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

The aim of this project was to investigate if stimulation of beta-oxidation and mitochondrial proliferation by the mitochondrial-targeted compound -(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic acid (1-triple TTA) would influence metabolites of the Trp-Kyn-NAD pathway. We wished to investigate how carnitine depletion by meldonium-treatment influenced these metabolites. After dietary treatment of male Wistar rats with 1-triple TTA for three weeks, increased hepatic mitochondrial- and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation resulted. The plasma content of total carnitines decreased compared to control animals, whereas hepatic genes involved in CoA biosynthesis were upregulated by 1-triple TTA treatment. The plasma Trp level and individual metabolites in the kynurenine pathway were increased by 1-triple TTA, associated with decreased hepatic gene expression of indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase. 1-triple TTA treatment increased conversion of Trp to nicotinamide (Nam) as the plasma content of quinolinic acid, Nam and N1-methylnicotinamide (mNam) increased, accompanied with suppression of hepatic gene expression of α-amino-α-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase. A positive correlation between mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and Trp-derivatives was found. Almost identical results were obtained by 1-triple TTA in the presence of meldonium, which alone exerted minor effects. Moreover, the plasma Kyn:Trp ratio (KTR) correlated negatively to mitochondrial function. Whether increased flux through the Trp-NAD pathway increased redox status and lowered  locally and systemically should be considered.Copyright © 2019.

Due to its pathological similarities to type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM), such as β-amyloid deposition, oxidative stress, , disordered glucose metabolism, impaired signaling pathways of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), we speculate that AD is another form of brain diabetes. Clarifying the relationship between T2DM and AD is important for us to better understand the exact pathological mechanisms of AD. Silibinin, a polyphenolic flavonoid extracted from the seeds of Silybum marianum, exerts hepatoprotective, anti- diabetic and neuroprotective effects. Streptozotocin (STZ), which is used to disrupt the insulin signal transduction pathway, could well mimic the sporadic AD models by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection. Therefore, we selected ICV injection of STZ (ICV-STZ) to investigate the neuroprotective effects of silibinin in rats and to make a foundation for further exploring the relationship between AD and T2DM. ICV-STZ obviously caused memory damage, sharply reduced the number of nissl bodies and destroyed morphological structure of hippocampal neuronal cells, while silibinin attenuated the damages. Moreover, silibinin significantly decreased STZ-induced tau hyperphosphorylation (ser404) in hippocampus and cerebral cortex, markedly inhibited apoptosis of neurons induced by STZ, and up-regulated insulin signal transduction pathway. Silibinin exerts neuroprotective effect in STZ-treated rats, indicating the potential of silibinin for the treatment of AD patients with T2DM in future.Copyright © 2019.

SLE is associated with hypercoagulability. Activated coagulation factors such as tissue factor and VIIa complex and factor Xa activate protease-activated receptor  (PAR2). PAR2 promotes cytokine production through mitogen-activated protein kinase or nuclear factor kappa B signaling, and previous reports demonstrated that inhibition of PAR2 alleviated kidney injuries such as diabetic kidney disease and renal fibrosis in animal models. However, the involvement of PAR2 in the pathogenesis of SLE remains unclear. We therefore administered a selective PAR2 peptide antagonist, FSLLRY-NH2, to SLE-prone 4-month-old MRL-Fas mice for 4 weeks. Treatment with FSLLRY-NH2 caused the significant increases in the glomerular mesangial proliferation, glomerular deposition of both immunoglobulin G and complement factor C3d, and glomerular infiltration of Mac2-positive macrophages and CD3-positive T cells, compared with MRL-Fas mice treated with saline. In addition, the treatment with the PAR2 antagonist increased renal expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (Tnfa) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (Mcp1) mRNA. Collectively, these results suggest that inhibition of PAR2 may increase the severity of  in lupus nephritis; namely, opposite to previous observations, PAR2 has anti-inflammatory properties.

While low-grade  may impair immune response, it is unknown whether inflammatory markers are associated with infection risk in this clinical population. Using 2003-2013 data from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study (3,597 participants with CKD), we assessed the association of baseline plasma levels of four inflammatory markers (interleukin-6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α], interleukin-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1RA], and transforming growth factor-β [TGF-β]), with incident hospitalization with major infection (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis and osteomyelitis, and bacteremia and sepsis). During follow-up (median 7.5years), 36% (n=1,290) had incident hospitalization with major infection. In multivariable Cox analyses with each inflammatory marker modeled as a restricted cubic spline, higher levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were monotonically associated with increased risk of hospitalization with major infection (HR at 95thvs.5thpercentile, .11 [95%CI,1.68,.66] for IL-6 and 1.88 [1.51,.33] for TNF-α), while corresponding associations for IL-1RA or TGF-β were non-significant. Thus, higher plasma levels of IL-6 and TNF-α, but not IL-1RA or TGF-β, were significantly associated with increased risk of hospitalization with major infection. Future studies should investigate whether inflammatory pathways that involve IL-6 and TNF-α increase susceptibility to infection among individuals with CKD.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the mechanisms by which its mediates the anti-inflammatory effects are not completely understood. Using an allergic murine model of asthma, we investigated whether Ang-1(1-7)/MAS1 receptor axis a): inhibits allergic  via modulation of Src-dependent transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and downstream signaling effectors such as ERK1/, and b): directly inhibits neutrophil and/or eosinophil chemotaxis ex vivo. Ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic  resulted in increased phosphorylation of Src kinase, EGFR, and ERK1/. In addition, OVA challenge increased airway cellular influx, perivascular and peribronchial , fibrosis, goblet cell hyper/metaplasia and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Treatment with Ang-(1-7) inhibited phosphorylation of Src kinase, EGFR, ERK1/, the cellular and histopathological changes and AHR. Ang-(1-7) treatment also inhibited neutrophil and eosinophil chemotaxis ex vivo. These changes were reversed following pre-treatment with A779. These data show that the anti-inflammatory actions of Ang-(1-7)/ MAS1 receptor axis are mediated, at least in part, via inhibition of Src-dependent transactivation of EGFR and downstream signaling molecules such as ERK1/. This study therefore shows that inhibition of the Src/EGRF/ERK1/ dependent signaling pathway is one of the mechanisms by which the Ang-(1-7)/ MAS1 receptor axis mediates it anti-inflammatory effects in diseases such as asthma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662636> Nematicidal Potential of Camel Milk on  Gastro-intestinal Nematode of Rodents.</a></h2><p>Following our previous findings on the  anthelmintic effect of camel milk on , the current study aimed at investigating its  effect.

Patients with similar activity levels may have different prognosis and molecular abnormalities. In this study, we aimed to measure the main differences in drug-induced gene expression signatures across SLE patients and to evaluate the potential for clinical data to build a machine learning classifier able to predict the SLE subset for individual patients. SLE transcriptomic data from two cohorts were compared with drug-induced gene signatures from the CLUE database to compute a connectivity score that reflects the capability of a drug to revert the patient signatures. Patient stratification based on drug connectivity scores revealed robust clusters of SLE patients identical to the clusters previously obtained through longitudinal gene expression data, implying that differential treatment depends on the cluster to which patients belongs. The best drug candidates found, mTOR inhibitors or those reducing oxidative stress, showed stronger cluster specificity. We report that drug patterns for reverting disease gene expression follow the cell-specificity of the disease clusters.

We have measured 25(OH)D concentration, markers of  including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and markers of oxidative stress including malondialdehyde (MDA) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) by using standard methods.We stratified control and T2DM groups by 25(OH)D concentration and it indicates that in severe deficiency and sufficiency category IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and Ox-LDL were significantly different while in moderate deficiency category only MDA was significantly different, among control and T2DM groups. In an insufficiency category, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, MDA, and Ox-LDL were significantly different among control and T2DM groups. Correlation analysis indicates a negative correlation of 25(OH)D with IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and Ox-LDL among total subjects. Further, logistics regression analysis demonstrated a significant association of different categories of 25(OH)D with IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and Ox-LDL before and after adjustment to body mass index and waist to hip ratio.This study suggest that vitamin D may have significant implications in the prevention of  and oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019.

Unlike for other rheumatic diseases, no specific biomarkers are available in clinical practice for diagnosing SpA. The aim of the present study was to search new potential biomarkers for SpA diagnosis by focusing on the innate immune response. An evaluation was made of the mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, TGF-β1, S100A8, S100A9) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP3, MMP8, MMP9) in blood mononuclear cells of SpA patients (n=64) with respect to controls (n=100). In parallel, the pattern of intracellular calcium flows of blood monocytes was verified in order to ascertain whether any specific fingerprint characterizes innate immune cells in SpA patients. Inflammatory cytokines and MMPs expression levels were not correlated with SpA, while in this disease a reduced expression of the S100A8 and a decreased frequency of monocytes showing intracellular calcium flows were observed. In conclusion, no specific signs of systemic  are detectable in SpA, but the disease affects the "on-off" mechanisms that regulate the concentration of intracellular calcium and calcium-related proteins. This potentially pave the way for the discovery of new biomarkers.Copyright © 2019.

Icariin, a flavonol glucoside, extracted from Herba Epimedii, offers various pharmacological activities, including reducing  and an antioxidant effect. We aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of icariin focussing on both HO-1/Nrf2 and NF-kB pathways. Acute  was induced in rats via carrageenan in this study. Icariin was injected in a dose of 50 mg/kg. Icariin significantly reduced paw swelling in carrageenan-injected animals. It also ameliorated carrageenan-induced paw histopathological alterations. Icariin significantly increased paw enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. It decreased paw lipid peroxidation. Icariin decreased paw levels of inflammatory cytokines and NF-kB. The immunohistochemical analysis showed that icariin significantly increased Nrf2 gene expression while decreasing NF-kB and COX- gene expression. RT-PCR analysis revealed that icariin injection significantly increased both Nrf2 and HO-1 expression of mRNA. The results of this study collectively show that icariin improved carrageenan-induced paw edema by modulating HO-1/Nrf2 and NF-ĸB signaling.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Accumulating findings suggest that low-grade  is a causative factor in T2DM and that circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines are associated with insulin resistance. However, inflammatory cytokine profiles and their correlations with T2DM development/ progression in  rats have not been studied. In this study, we found that the  rats had considerably high plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1α. Abundant cecal IL-1α mRNA expression and cecal  with infiltrating IL-1α-producing macrophages was observed in  rats. Bone marrow derived macrophages from  rats expressed high levels of IL-1α upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Furthermore,  infection, which delays the onset of T2DM, reduced both plasma and cecal IL-1α levels in  rats. These results suggest that macrophage infiltration and IL-1α secretion comprise an important part of T2DM development and that  infection inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in  rats.© 2018 M.

Lipid peroxidation product-mediated cross-linking of proteins in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) causes HDL dysfunction and contributes to atherogenesis. Although HNE is relatively well studied, the role of ONE in atherosclerosis and in modifying HDL is unknown. Here, we found that individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) had significantly higher ONE-ketoamide (lysine) adducts in HDL (54.6 ± 33.8 pmol/mg) than healthy controls (15.3 ± 5.6 pmol/mg). ONE crosslinked apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) on HDL at a concentration of > 3 mol ONE per 10 mol apoA-I (0.3 eq.), which was 100-fold lower than HNE, but comparable to the potent protein crosslinker isolevuglandin. ONE-modified HDL partially inhibited HDL's ability to protect against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor α (Tnfα) and interleukin-1β (Il-1β) gene expression in murine macrophages. At 3 eq., ONE dramatically decreased apoA-I exchange from HDL, from ~46.5% to ~18.4% (P < 0.001). Surprisingly, ONE modification of HDL or apoA-I did not alter macrophage cholesterol efflux capacity. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that Lys-12, Lys-23, Lys-96, and Lys-226 in apoA-I are modified by ONE ketoamide adducts. Compared with other dicarbonyl scavengers, pentyl-pyridoxamine (PPM) most efficaciously blocked ONE-induced protein cross-linking in HDL and also prevented HDL dysfunction in an in vitro model of . Our findings show that ONE-HDL adducts cause HDL dysfunction and are elevated in individuals with FH who have severe hypercholesterolemia.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674069>MAGNETIC RESONANCE ENTEROGRAPHY (MRE) FOR PREDICTING THE CLINICAL COURSE OF CROHN'S DISEASE STRICTURES.</a></h2><p>Background and aims Strictures are the commonest Crohn's disease complication but their natural history is unknown. This study aimed to characterise , predict prognosis, and understand the impact of drug therapy using Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE).Patients with a stricture diagnosed on MRE over a 5-year period were reviewed for MRE disease extent and , clinical course, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), response to anti-TNF therapy, endoscopic dilatation, hospitalization and surgery.136 patients had 235 (77 one and 59 ≥ two) strictures.46% of patients underwent surgery after a median 6 months; median follow-up for those not requiring surgery was 41 months. Predictors of surgery: Hospitalization due to obstruction predicted subsequent surgery (OR .50; 95% CI 1.06-5.90) while anti-TNF therapy commenced at stricture diagnosis was associated with a reduced risk (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.05-0.99). MRE characteristics associated with surgery were proximal bowel dilatation ≥30mm diameter (OR, .98; 95% CI 1.36-6.55), stricture bowel wall thickness ≥10mm (OR .42; 95% CI 1.11-5.27), and stricture length >5cm (OR .56; 95% CI 1.21-5.43). 81% of patients with these 3 adverse MRE features required surgery versus 17% if none were present (P<0.001). Accuracy for these 3 MRE variables predicting surgery was high (AUC 0.76).MRE findings in Crohn's disease strictures are highly predictive of the disease course and the need for future surgery. MRE may also identify who would benefit from treatment intensification. Anti-TNF therapy is associated with reduced risk of surgery and appears to alter the natural history of this complication.This article is protected by copyright.

Due to calcium demand increasing with lactation onset, most cows become hypocalcemic immediately postpartum, which likely contributes to poorer immune function because calcium is important for immune cell signaling. To overcome postpartum hypocalcemia, we fed transition cows synthetic zeolite A (sodium aluminosilicate) precalving and hypothesized that it would alter calcium and thus neutrophil function during the transition period. Multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows in late gestation were randomly allocated to an untreated control group (n = 10) or a treatment group in which each cow received 500 g of zeolite A daily (n = 10) for 14 d prior to the expected calving date (actual duration = 17 ± 3 d prepartum). The cows grazed pasture, and each was supplemented with  kg/d of maize silage (dry matter basis), with or without zeolite, until calving. Blood samples for neutrophil isolation and analysis of plasma indicators of mineral status, energy status, liver function, and  were collected pretreatment (covariate; d -19); on d -14 and -7 precalving; on the day of calving (d 0); and on d 1, 4, 7, and 28 postcalving. Neutrophils were isolated and gene expression was analyzed using microfluidic gene expression arrays. Neutrophil respiratory burst was assessed using stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and flow cytometry. Plasma calcium and phosphorus revealed a treatment by time interaction; cows offered zeolite had greater plasma calcium concentrations at d 0, 1, and 4 postcalving and plasma phosphorus concentrations were lower in zeolite-treated cows during the precalving period until d 1 postcalving compared with control animals. Zeolite treatment downregulated neutrophil gene expression of CXCR4 and S100A8 and tended to lower gene expression for other immune mediators (CXCR1, IFNG, S100A12, and S100A9) compared with the control. Zeolite treatment did not affect neutrophil respiratory burst or expression of the other genes investigated. Plasma concentrations of cytokine IL-6 were reduced with zeolite treatment, which was most evident immediately postcalving (d 0, 1, and 7). Overall, feeding zeolite precalving had few effects on neutrophil gene expression and function; however, the lower gene expression of neutrophil inflammatory mediators may be due to altered availability of dietary minerals prepartum and indicates that zeolite A may control  during the transition period.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

Studies have found that enhancement of autophagy, an intracellular catabolic process, may limit the pathologic progression of OA. Chloramphenicol is a potent activator of autophagy; however, the effects of chloramphenicol on articular cartilage are unknown.Using human OA knee chondrocytes in vitro, we asked, does chloramphenicol (1) activate autophagy in chondrocytes; () protect chondrocytes from IL-1β-induced apoptosis; and (3) reduce the expression of matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-13 and IL-6 (markers associated with articular cartilage degradation and joint ). Using an in vivo rabbit model of OA, we asked, does an intra-articular injection of chloramphenicol in the knee (4) induce autophagy; (5) reduce OA severity; and (6) reduce MMP-13 expression?Human chondrocytes were extracted from 10 men with OA undergoing TKA. After treatment with 25 μg/mL, 50 μg/mL, or 100μg/mL chloramphenicol, the autophagy of chondrocytes was detected with Western blotting, transmission electron microscopy, or an autophagy detection kit. There were four groups in our study: one group was untreated, one was treated with 100 μg/mL chloramphenicol, another was treated with 10 ng/mL of IL-1β, and the final group was treated with 10 ng/mL of IL-1β and 100 μg/mL of chloramphenicol. All groups were treated for 48 hours; cell apoptosis was detected with Western blotting and flow cytometry.  marker IL-6 in the cell culture supernatant was detected with an ELISA. Articular cartilage degradation-related enzyme MMP-13 was analyzed with Western blotting. A rabbit model of OA was induced by intra-articular injection of type II collagenase in 20 male 3-month-old New Zealand White rabbits' right hind leg knees; the left hind leg knees served as controls. Rabbits were treated by intra-articular injection of saline or chloramphenicol once a week for 8 weeks. Autophagy of the articular cartilage was detected with Western blotting and transmission electron microscopy. Degeneration of articular cartilage was analyzed with Safranin O-fast green staining and the semi-quantitative index Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) grading system. Degeneration of articular cartilage was evaluated using the OARSI grading system. The expression of MMP-13 in articular cartilage was detected with immunohistochemistry.Chloramphenicol activated autophagy in vitro in the chondrocytes of humans with OA and in an in vivo rabbit model of OA. Chloramphenicol inhibited IL-1-induced apoptosis (flow cytometry results with chloramphenicol, 25.33 ± 3.51%, and without chloramphenicol, 44.00 ± 3.61%, mean difference, 18.67% [95% CI 10.60 to 26.73]; p = 0.003) and the production of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 (ELISA results, with chloramphenicol, 720.00 ± 96.44 pg/mL, without chloramphenicol, 966.67 ± 85.05 pg/mL; mean difference 74.24 pg/mL [95% CI 39.28 to 454.06]; p = 0.029) in chondrocytes. After chloramphenicol treatment, the severity of cartilage degradation was reduced in the treatment group (OARSI 6.80 ± .71) compared with the control group (12.30 ± .77), (mean difference 5.50 [95% CI 1.50 to 9.50]; p = 0.013). Furthermore, chloramphenicol treatment also decreased the production of MMP-13 in vitro and in vivo.Chloramphenicol reduced the severity of cartilage degradation in a type II collagen-induced rabbit model of OA, which may be related to induction of autophagy and inhibition of MMP-13 and IL-6.Our study suggests that an intra-articular injection of chloramphenicol may reduce degeneration of articular cartilage and that induction of autophagy may be a method for treating OA. The animal model we used was type II collagen-induced OA, which was different from idiopathic OA and post-traumatic OA. Therefore, we need to use other types of OA models (idiopathic OA or a surgically induced OA model) to further verify its effect, and the side effects of chloramphenicol also need to be considered, such as myelosuppression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666055>Dysuria due to benign prostatic hyperplasia of the median lobe with ketamine-associated uropathy in a young male.</a></h2><p>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) rarely occurs in children or young males.

Despite decades of extensive research on understanding its underlying mechanism and developing the pharmacological treatment, very little is known about the biological alterations leading to epileptogenesis. Due to this gap, the currently available antiepileptic drug therapy is symptomatic in nature and is ineffective in 30% of the cases. Mounting evidences revealed the pathophysiological role of neuroinflammation in epilepsy which has shifted the focus of epilepsy researchers towards the development of neuroinflammation-targeted therapeutics for epilepsy management. Markedly increased expression of key inflammatory mediators in the brain and blood-brain barrier may affect neuronal function and excitability and thus may increase seizure susceptibility in preclinical and clinical settings. Cyclooxygenase- (COX-), an enzyme synthesizing the proinflammatory mediators, prostaglandins, has widely been reported to be induced during seizures and is considered to be a potential neurotherapeutic target for epilepsy management. However, the efficacy of such therapy involving COX- inhibition depends on various factors viz., therapeutic dose, time of administration, treatment duration, and selectivity of COX- inhibitors. This article reviews the preclinical and clinical evidences supporting the role of COX- in seizure-associated neuroinflammation in epilepsy and the potential clinical use of COX- inhibitors as a future strategy for epilepsy treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666086>Mesenchymal stromal cell conditioned media for lung disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical studies.</a></h2><p> plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many lung diseases.

Meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed to generate random effect size using standardized mean difference (SMD).A total of 10 studies met inclusion. Lung diseases included bronchopulmonary dysplasia, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. CdM decreased inflammatory cells (1.02 SMD, 95% CI 0.86, 1.18) and cytokines (0.71 SMD, 95% CI 0.59, 0.84).

Our objective was to delineate the protective effect and the underlying mechanism of Saxa-in comparison with Dexamethasone (Dexa) - in airway  induced by ovalbumin (OVA) in mice.Mice were OVA-sensitized and challenged for the induction of acute asthma. Mice were orally administrated Saxa or Dexa. Total and differential cell counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and total protein concentrations were assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB), reduced glutathione (GSH), and total nitrate/nitrite products (NOx) levels as well as myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung tissues were measured. Histopathological examination of the lung specimens was carried out using the hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining.Histopathological examination revealed that both Saxa and Dexa ameliorated OVA-induced inflammatory changes and significantly reduced total and differential leukocyte counts, LDH and total protein level in BALF upon comparison with OVA group. In addition, both treatments significantly mitigated OVA-induced oxidative stress as evidenced by diminished lung NOx level and MPO activity and elevated GSH level. The elevation of TLR4 and NF-kB levels in lung tissue were ameliorated by Saxa and Dexa administration.Saxa had marked antiasthmatic effect in OVA-induced allergic asthma through modulation of TLR4 and NF-κB signaling.

We therefore designed this study to firstly determine the association between hyperglycemia and short term and longer term outcomes in patients presenting with ACS and secondly evaluate the prognostic role of diabetes, body mass index (BMI) and the novel biomarker Cyr61 on outcomes.The prospective Special Program University Medicine-Acute Coronary Syndrome (SPUM-ACS) cohort enrolled 2168 patients with ACS between December 2009 and October 2012, of which 2034 underwent PCI (93.8%). Patients were followed up for 12 months. Events were independently adjudicated by three experienced cardiologists. Participants were recruited from four tertiary hospitals in Switzerland: Zurich, Geneva, Lausanne and Bern. Participants presenting with acute coronary syndromes and who underwent coronary angiography were included in the analysis. Patients were grouped according to history of diabetes (or HbA1c greater than 6%), baseline blood sugar level (BSL; < 6, 6-11.1 and > 11.1 mmol/L) and body mass index (BMI). The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac events (MACE) which was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke and all-cause death. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary endpoint, revascularisations, bleeding events (BARC classification) and cerebrovascular events (ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke or TIA).Patients with hyperglycemia, i.e. BSL ≥ 11.1 mmol/L, had higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine kinase (CK), higher heart rates and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and increased N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. At 30 days and 12 months, those with BSL ≥ 11.1 mmol/L had more MACE and death compared to those with BSL < 6.0 mmol/L or 6.0-11.1 mmol/L (HR-ratio 4.78 and 6.6; p < 0.001).

Animals were anesthetized after 48 h; their colon tissue samples were isolated for macroscopic and histopathological examination. The expression of receptor of CXC chemokine was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) technique.Heavy infiltration of neutrophils, coagulative necrosis, and ulcers were observed in H and E staining, which pathologically proved the UC model. qRT-PCR results indicated that CXCR2 as one of the important ELR chemokine family receptors bears the highest expression in the UC group (32 fold) than the control group ( ≤ 0.05). In addition, other CXCRs of this group including CXCR1 did not possess any change ( > 0.05). In contrast, RLR negative chemokine family receptors did not show any changes with the normal group.The results showed that CXCR2 is the only receptor for CXCL family which was remarkably upregulated in experimental UC and that CXCR2 might play a significant role in the pathogenesis of UC.Copyright: © 2019 Advanced Biomedical Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663504>Effect of Non-Surgical Periodontal Therapy on the Serum Sialic Acid Levels in Diabetic Patients with Periodontitis.</a></h2><p>Sialic acid (SA), a family of acetylated derivatives of neuraminic acid, an acute phase reactant by itself. It usually occurs as a terminal component at the non-reducing end of carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids. SA participates in multiple physiological functions, such as cell-to-cell interactions, cell migration and proliferation. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by rise in blood glucose level. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the periodontal tissue, leading to destruction of bone surrounding the tooth and ultimately tooth loss. There is a two way relationship between diabetes mellitus and periodontitis. Periodontitis is the sixth complication of diabetes along with retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, macrovascular disease, and altered wound healing. Inflammatory mediators like interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha produced during periodontal  can interfere with the actions of insulin receptors and worsen the glycemic control of diabetic patients. Periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss, affecting over 300 million people and bacteria associated with periodontitis are also linked with systemic problems like endocarditis, atherosclerosis. Recent work has highlighted a major role for the host sugar sialic acid in the biofilm physiology and host-pathogen interactions of T. forsithya, a key periodontal pathogen. There exists a need for a biomarker, for early detection of disease evolution and more robust therapy efficacy measurements. Serum sialic acids were estimated in Indian population by diphenylamine method and Thiobarbituric acid method. The average values were 68 ± .6 mg percent by DPA method and 56 ± 5 mg percent by TBA (thiobarbituric acid assay) method. Age and sex showed no influence on serum sialic acid level. Objectives of the present study was to compare (TSSA) level in healthy subjects, subjects with (CMP) with and without (NIDDM) and its effect on non-surgical periodontal therapy. In the present study, the participants were divided into three groups: Group A, B and C. Group A consists of systemically healthy subjects, Group B consists of subjects with (CMP) while Group C consists of subjects with (CMP) with (NIDDM) and results of this study indicated that, at baseline, there were significant differences between Group A, B and Group C with respect to all the clinical parameters, including (GI), (OHI-S), (PPD), (CAL), (TSSA) and (HbA1c) levels. Thus (TSSA) level could be considered as novel biomarker in the progression of periodontal disease and diabetic status. Periodontitis could be considered as a potential, modifiable, and independent risk factor for the development of diabetes. Early detection of elevated (TSSA) level may help in interpreting the progression of periodontitis, risk of development of diabetes mellitus in future and also to prevent complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672435>Contemporary cardiovascular outcomes in Taiwanese patients undergoing endovascular therapy for symptomatic lower extremity peripheral arterial disease.</a></h2><p>To investigate contemporary cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in Taiwanese patients with symptomatic low extremity peripheral artery disease treated with endovascular therapy.An observational cohort study with up to 155 months of follow-up was conducted using a single-center registry database between July 2005 and June 2017. Long-term outcomes and predictors of future CV events were analyzed in 936 patients with 1246 affected legs.This study cohort comprised 21% claudicants and 79% critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients. Compared with claudicants, CLI patients had higher rates of medical comorbidities, tissue , and lesion complexities. During the study period, 349 patients died (130 CV deaths and 219 non-CV deaths), 306 had non-fatal CV events. The rates of 5-year freedom from all-cause mortality, major CV events (MACEs), and non-fatal CV events were 54.9%, 67.1%, and 56.6% respectively. For CLI patients, independent factors for all-cause mortality were age (odds ratio [OR] 1.03), atrial fibrillation (OR 1.79), albumin (OR 0.62), hematocrit (OR 0.96), body mass index (OR 0.94), C-reactive protein (OR 1.18), dialysis (OR .16), and non-ambulance (OR .05). Congestive heart failure, dialysis, and non-ambulance independently predicted the MACEs (OR .04, 1.93, and 1.67, respectively). For claudicants, coronary artery disease (CAD) was the essential factor for all-cause mortality (OR .24), MACE (OR .76) and non-fatal CV events (OR 1.82).Long-term survival and MACE-free rates were significantly worse in CLI patients than in claudicants. Malnutrition and  were associated with long-term survival. CAD, low hematocrit, dialysis, CHF, and ambulatory status predicted future CV events.Copyright © 2019 Formosan Medical Association.

Because immunomodulators are pivotal to DKD pathophysiology, anti-inflammatory agents may be useful for treating DKD. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of micheliolide (MCL), a novel guaianolide sesquiterpene lactone with well-known anti-inflammatory effects, on DKD. Treatment with dimethylaminomicheliolide (DMAMCL), the pro-drug of MCL currently under clinical trial in oncology, protected the kidneys against proteinuria, renal failure, histopathological injury, and  in db/db mice. This effect was associated with metadherin (Mtdh) downregulation. We observed aberrant upregulation of Mtdh in the kidneys of db/db mice and high-glucose (HG)-induced mouse tubular epithelial cells (mTECs). Downregulation of Mtdh obviously inhibited nuclear factor-κB signaling activation and suppressed its downstream inflammatory cytokines, such as monocyte chemotactic peptide-1, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6 in HG-induced mTECs, which was similar to the effect of MCL. Mtdh overexpression largely reversed the anti-inflammatory role of MCL. Moreover, MCL downregulated Mtdh by both inhibiting the transcription level and promoting ubiquitin-mediated degradation. These findings suggest that DMAMCL is a promising anti-inflammatory agent useful for preventing renal injury in DKD by inhibiting Mtdh-mediated renal .Copyright © 2019.

We aimed to determine the prevalence of LSTVs and to assess their associations with sacroiliitis by standard radiography and MRI in a population with suspected axial spondyloarthritis.The data were from the DESIR cohort of 688 patients aged 18-50 years with inflammatory low back pain for ⩾3 months but <3 years suggesting axial spondyloarthritis. The baseline pelvic radiographs were read by two blinded readers for the presence and type (Castellvi classification) of LSTVs. Associations between LSTVs and other variables collected at baseline and at the diagnosis were assessed using the χ test (or Fisher's exact test) or the Mann-Whitney test.LSTV was found in 200/688 (29.1%) patients. Castellvi type was Ia in 54 (7.8%), Ib in 76 (11.0%), IIa in 20 (.9%), IIb in 12 (1.7%), IIIa in 7 (1.0%), IIIb in 21 (3.0%) and IV in 10 (1.4%) patients.

However, its role in predicting therapeutic response to phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors is incompletely understood.The aim of this study was to understand the relationship among hs-CRP, mechanism of ED, and therapeutic response of ED to tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor.A total of 282 men (mean age 36.6 ± 12.0 years) with ED were included. All subjects underwent detailed evaluation, including estimation of a 6-item abbreviated version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-6) score, penile Doppler studies, and measurement of hs-CRP. IIEF-6 scoring and hs-CRP measurement were repeated after 6 weeks of tadalafil therapy (10 mg/day). The patients were categorized into vasculogenic and nonvasculogenic ED groups based on penile Doppler findings.The main outcome measure was the therapeutic response to tadalafil, in relation to the mechanism of ED and hs-CRP levels.Vasculogenic ED was much less common (23.8% of the subjects) than non-vasculogenic ED. Subjects with vasculogenic ED were older, had higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, had more severe (mean IIEF-6 score 9. ± 4.6 vs 14.8 ± 4.7; P < .001) and longer duration ED, and responded less favorably to therapy (response rate 10.4% vs 75.0%; P < .001). Those showing improvement with tadalafil had lower hs-CRP at baseline (median 1.5 mg/L [interquartile range 0.9-.3] vs .0 mg/L [interquartile range 1.1-3.1; P = .034]) and had proportionately greater reduction in its level. However, on multivariate analysis, only shorter duration of ED (P = .008), non-vasculogenic origin (P = .025), and higher IIEF-6 score at baseline (P = .013) were independent predictors of response to treatment.Serum hs-CRP is elevated in patients who are less likely to respond to vasodilator therapy but does not have an independent predictive value for this purpose.This is the largest study to evaluate the relationship among the mechanism of ED, serum hs-CRP level, and therapeutic response of ED to tadalafil. All patients underwent a penile Doppler study to characterize the type of ED. The limitations were nonrandomized nature of the study and nearly 22% dropout rate.Serum hs-CRP level is higher in vasculogenic ED compared with non-vasculogenic ED, and is associated with poorer response to tadalafil therapy. However, this association is not independent of underlying risk factors and mechanism of ED. Jamaluddin, Bansal M, Srivastava GK, et al.

The MTT assay was used for cellular viability assessment. Viability of cells was observed using inverted light microscope 24, 48 and 72 h after exposure of the cells to various concentrations of TQ (1, .5, 5, 10, 50 and 100 μg/ml) and Cis-platinum (0.5, 1, 1.5, , 3, 6 and 12.5 μg/ml). Moreover, apoptosis was analyzed with a flow-cytometry method. The untreated cells were considered as control group.Morphological changes such as reduced cell number and increased intercellular distance and reduced cell viability in ACHN and GP-293cell lines were observed in both TQ and Cis-platinum groups; however, Cis-platinum had greater effect on ACHN cell line than GP-293 cell line. In addition, GP-293 cell line was more sensitive to TQ compared to ACHN cell line. Furthermore, TQ and Cis-platinum had apoptotic effects on both ACHN and GP-293 cell lines.Our findings demonstrated that TQ and Cis-platinum had cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on both cell lines, However, GP-293 cell line was more sensitive to TQ.

Classic white light endoscopy shows some pathognomonic signs of LPR in children, such as thickening of pharyngo-laryngeal mucus, the cobblestoning aspect of pharyngeal mucosa, arytenoid edema/hyperemia, nodular thickening/true vocal cord edema, hypertrophy of the posterior commissure, subglottic edema. The NBI (Narrow Band Imaging) technology, generally used in oncology, allows to study neoangiogenesis and hypervascularization of the mucosa, common aspects in both chronic  and neoplastic transformation. The aim of our study was to evaluate the added value of this technology in identifying the main laryngopharyngeal reflux sign in a pediatric population.We evaluated at the Otolaryngology Unit of the "Fondazione Policlinico A. Gemelli" hospital and the Airway Surgery Unit of the "Bambino Gesù" Children's Hospital 35 patients aged from  months to 16 years divided into two groups in the period between November 2017 and May 2018. Group A included patients with clinical suspicion of LPR after gastroenterologist evaluation and Group B included patients who underwent an endoscopic evaluation for the assessment of recurrent respiratory symptoms such as stridor, recurrent croup, wheezing and persistent cough. We performed an endoscopic evaluation by white light and NBI for each patient, comparing the results of both methods to evaluate signs of pharyngo-laryngeal reflux and to calculate the value of reflux finding score (RFS).The analysis of the data showed: for Group A an average value of RFS with white light of 11,84 (range 8-17, standard deviation ,52 ± 0,57) and with NBI of 13,63 (range 10-17, standard deviation ,13 ± 0,49); for Group B the analysis of the data showed an average value of RFS with white light of 10,06 (range 8-14, standard deviation ,32 ± 0,58) and with NBI of 12,50 (range 9-18, standard deviation ,63 ± 0,65). The comparison between the two methods resulted significant. Furthermore evaluation by NBI allowed to highlight other signs of pharyngo-laryngeal reflux, characteristic of pediatric age and not included in RFS, in particular cobblestone aspect of the hypopharingeal mucosa, phlogosis of the tonsillar crypts and adenoid surface, hyperemia and hypervascularization of subglottic and tracheal mucosa.Although still preliminary our results represent an interesting starting point for further studies, because they underline the potentiality of NBI endoscopy in LPR evaluation and how this technology could improve the identification of reflux signs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon  and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

Alpinetin has been shown to improve intestinal barrier homeostasis under colitis condition, but the mechanism is still unclear. Here, we showed that alpinetin significantly improved transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in TNF-α-stimulated Caco- cells, which was mainly mediated by inhibiting the apoptosis. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that alpinetin markedly increased the production of autophagosomes, along with obvious regulation of LC3B-II, beclin-1, p62, Atg7 and Atg5 expressions. In addition, it also markedly repressed the activation of mTORC1 signaling pathway, which was ascribed to TSC2 rather than p-AKT, p-ERK, p-AMPKα or PTEN expressions in Caco- and NCM460 cells. Furthermore, the enrichment of H3K9me3 at TSC2 promoter region was decreased and ubiquitin proteasome degradation of suv39h1 was increased. Additionally, alpinetin activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and promoted co-localization of AhR with suv39h1 in the cytoplasm. The relationship between alpinetin-regulated AhR/suv39h1/TSC2/mTORC1 signals, autophagy and apoptosis of Caco- and NCM460 cells was confirmed by using CH223191, siAhR, siTSC2 and chloroquine. Finally, CH223191 and leucine abolished alpinetin-mediated inhibition of intestinal epithelial cells apoptosis, improvement of intestinal epithelial barrier and amelioration of colitis.Copyright © 2019.

However, excessive activation is associated with inflammatory and metabolic diseases. Several TLR2 antagonists have been described but pharmacological characterization is still at an early stage. Previously, we identified the potent and selective TLR2 antagonist MMG-11 by computational modelling and experimental validation.Here, we characterized the TLR2 antagonists MMG-11 and CU-CPT22 as well as the TIR-domain binding TLR2 antagonist C29 in TLR-overexpressing promoter cells as well as human and mouse macrophages. In line with our recent studies, MMG-11 abrogated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and NF-κB activation induced by different bacterial TLR2 agonists. MMG-11 preferentially inhibited TLR2/1 signaling in promoter cells stably expressing TLR2 heterodimers and mouse macrophages. Furthermore, the TLR2 antagonist blocked ligand-induced interaction of TLR2 with MyD88 and reduced MAP kinase and NF-κB activation. MMG-11 and CU-CPT22 but not C29 displaced PamCSK in an indirect binding assay confirming the competitive mode of action of MMG-11 and CU-CPT22. Isobologram analysis revealed additive and synergistic effects when the non-competitive antagonist C29 was combined with the competitive antagonist MMG-11 or CU-CPT22, respectively. In conclusion, we provide evidence that MMG-11 acts as a competitive antagonist with a predominance for the TLR2/1 heterodimer in human and mouse cells. Our results also indicate that MMG-11 is a model compound for studying TLR2 signaling.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the present study was to compare the CRP levels of PD patients with vs patients without freezing of gait (FOG). Patients and controls participating in the COPPADIS-2015 study that performed blood extraction for determining molecular serum biomarkers were included. Patients with FOG were identified as those with a score of 1 or greater on item-3 of the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOG-Q). Immunoassay was used for determining ultrasensitive CRP (US-CRP) level (mg/dL). In the PD group (n = 225; 61.8 ± 9.5 years old, 61.8% males), 32% of the patients presented FOG but none in the control group (n = 65; 60.3 ± 6.1 years old, 56.9% males) (p < 0.0001).

In this context, here we describe protein complexes with a new 'complexing excipient' - vitamin B-targeted poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(glutamic acid) copolymers. These form complexes in sub-200 nm size with a model protein, suitable for cellular targeting and intracellular delivery. Initially we confirmed expression of vitamin B-internalization receptor (CD320) by Calu-3 cells of the in vitro lung epithelial model used, and demonstrated enhanced B receptor-mediated cellular internalization of B-targeted complexes, relative to non-targeted counterparts or protein alone. To develop an inhalation formulation, the protein complexes were spray dried adopting a standard protocol into powders with aerodynamic diameter within the suitable range for lower airway deposition. The cellular internalization of targeted complexes from dry powders applied directly to Calu-3 model was found to be -3 fold higher compared to non-targeted complexes. The copolymer complexes show no complement activation, and in vivo lung tolerance studies demonstrated that repeated administration of formulated dry powders over a 3 week period in healthy BALB/c mice induced no significant toxicity or indications of lung , as assessed by cell population count and quantification of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α pro-inflammatory markers. Importantly, the in vivo data appear to suggest that B-targeted polymer complexes administered as dry powder enhance lung retention of their protein payload, relative to protein alone and non-targeted counterparts. Taken together, our data illustrate the potential developability of novel B-targeted poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(glutamic acid) copolymers as excipients suitable to be formulated into a dry powder product for the inhalation delivery of proteins, with no significant lung toxicity, and with enhanced protein retention at their in vivo target tissue.Copyright © 2019.

ELISA studies confirmed increased maternal plasma levels of complement 4, prothrombin, and C-reactive protein in BN compared to LEW pregnancies. LEW pregnancies showed higher maternal plasma levels of transthyretin and haptoglobin than BN pregnancies. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that BN pregnancies are characterized by activation of pro-coagulant, reactive oxygen species, and immune-mediated chronic  pathways, and suggested increased interleukin 6 and decreased transforming growth factor-β1 as potential upstream events. Plasma cytokine analysis revealed that pregnant BN dams have a switch from anti- to pro-inflammatory cytokines with the opposite switch observed in pregnant LEW dams.BN rats show a maternal pro-inflammatory response to pregnancy that likely contributes to the reproductive outcomes observed in this rat strain.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Although various HS-imaging techniques using fluorescence and luminescence have been developed, only one radionuclide imaging using Cu-labeled cyclen complex was reported. Thus, we tried to develop Tc-labeled HS imaging agents.Various α-hydroxy acids such as glycolate, L-lactate, D-lactate, D-gluconate, D-glucoheptonate, D-glucuronate, D-glucarate, and citrate were labeled with Tc in the presence of stannous chloride. The labeled compounds were incubated with 0. mM of NaHS, and reactive sulfur species and then analyzed by ITLC/normal saline to detect the formation of insoluble complex. Matrigels containing various concentrations of NaHS were xenografted on the shoulder of normal mice, and an imaging study was performed after intravenous injection of [Tc]Tc-gluconate. We also obtained autoradiography image of a rat brain with a temporary brain ischemia after intravenous injection of [Tc]Tc-gluconate.[Tc]Tc-gluconate showed the highest formation of insoluble complex (87.8 ± 3.6%) after incubation with 0. mM NaHS. The other reactive species such as glutathione, cysteine, sulfite, sulfate, thiosulfate, and NO did not form insoluble complex representing the reaction being specific to HS. The Matrigel containing  μmol NaHS showed uptake of [Tc]Tc-gluconate, which proved the feasibility as the specific HS imaging agent in vivo. Temporary ischemic lesion of rat brain showed high radioactivity accumulation representing the feasibility as endogenous HS imaging agents.We proved that Tc-labeled α-hydroxy acid especially [Tc]Tc-gluconate is a novel endogenous HS imaging agent, which might contribute to study and diagnosis of various diseases related with  and hypoxia.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We sought to evaluate the clinical and genetic risk factors associated with AI-associated arthralgia (AIAA).We performed a cross-sectional study among postmenopausal women with stage 0-III breast cancer who were prescribed a third-generation AI for adjuvant therapy. The primary outcome was patient-reported AIAA occurrence. We extracted and assayed germline DNA for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes implicated in estrogen and  pathways. Multivariable logistic regression models examined the association between demographic, clinical, and genetic factors and AIAA. Analyses were restricted to White participants.Among 1049 White participants, 543 (52%) reported AIAA. In multivariable analyses, women who had a college education [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 1.49, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.00-.20], had a more recent transition into menopause (<10 years) (5-10 years AOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.09-.22; <5 years AOR 1.78, 95% CI 1.18-.67), were within one year of starting AIs (AOR 1.61, 95% CI 1.08-.40), and those who received chemotherapy (AOR 1.38, 95% CI 1.02-1.88) were significantly more likely to report AIAA. Additionally, SNP rs11648233 (HSD17B2) was significantly associated with higher odds of AIAA (AOR .21, 95% CI 1.55-3.16).Time since menopause and start of AIs, prior chemotherapy, and SNP rs11648233 within the HSD17B2 gene in the estrogen pathway were significantly associated with patient-reported AIAA. These findings suggest that clinical and genetic factors involved in estrogen withdrawal increase the risk of AIAA in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway detects cytosolic DNA and induces innate immunity. Here, we investigate the role of mitochondrial damage and subsequent activation of the cGAS-STING pathway using a genetically engineered animal model of cisplatin-induced AKI and cultured tubular cells. Cisplatin induced mtDNA leakage into the cytosol-probably through BCL--like protein 4 (BAX) pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane-in tubules, with subsequent activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, thereby triggering  and AKI progression, which is improved in STING-deficient mice. STING knockdown in cultured tubular cells ameliorates inflammatory responses induced by cisplatin. mtDNA depletion and repletion studies support tubular inflammatory responses via the cGAS-STING signal activation by cytosolic mtDNA. Therefore, we conclude that mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent activation of the mtDNA-cGAS-STING pathway is a critical regulator of kidney injury.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Piroxicam and sulindac sulfide are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) that decrease the incidence and progression of several types of cancer. However, their role in suppressing the interactions between TAMs and cancer cells remain unclear. Herein, we studied the impact of human monocytes conditioned media (CM) on cellular proliferation of ER-dependent MCF-7 and ER-independent MDA-MB-231 cells, and the effects of piroxicam and sulindac sulfide on the expression levels of RAS, COX-, IL-6, IL-1β and PAR-4 (qRT-PCR), BCL- and BAX (western blot), Caspase-3, VEGF-a and PGE (ELISA), MMP- and -9 (zymography) in the stimulated cells. Our results showed that CM caused a significant increase in cells survival through significant increase in RAS expression which resulted in upregulation of COX-, PGE, BCL-, IL-6, IL-1β, VEGF-A and MMP-9 and down regulation of PAR-4. Treatment with one of the NSAIDs used in this study produced a time and concentration dependent growth inhibition of stimulated cells by inhibiting RAS expression. Suppression of RAS was accompanied by downregulation of its downstream signaling of IL-1β, IL-6, COX- and PGE, activation of apoptotic machinery through upregulation of PAR-4 and caspase-3, as well as, inhibition of BCL-, VEGF-A, MMP- and MMP-9. In conclusion, our data support the role of piroxicam and sulindac sulfide in suppressing -driven breast cancer progression and identifies promising novel target in RAS and PAR-4 signaling.Copyright © 2019.

Phytochemicals have been described as protective agents against rheumatoid arthritis-linked testicular impairment. The current study aimed to investigate the potential protective effects of ellagic acid on rheumatoid arthritis-evoked testicular dysfunction vis-à-vis the reference anti-inflammatory celecoxib.Ellagic acid (50 mg/kg/day) and celecoxib (5 mg/kg/day) were administered orally for 20 days in adjuvant-induced arthritic rats.Current data revealed that ellagic acid counteracted rheumatoid arthritis-evoked testicular histopathologic changes and disrupted sperm characteristics and lowered the gonadosomatic index with comparable efficacy to celecoxib. Ellagic acid also enhanced the testicular steroidogenesis via upregulating the gene expression of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein with consequent boosting of serum testosterone. Notably, ellagic acid attenuated the testicular inflammatory responses through suppression of myeloperoxidase, tumor necrosis factor-α and cyclo-oxygenase- protein expression together with enhancing the anti-inflammatory signal interleukin 10. It also curbed the redox alterations via lowering the production of lipid peroxides and nitric oxide and elevation of the anti-oxidant reduced glutathione. In support of testicular cell survival, ellagic acid combated testicular apoptosis through downregulating caspase-3 protein expression.The present work accentuates the beneficial actions of ellagic acid in rheumatoid arthritis-incurred testicular impairment and disrupted spermatogenesis via combating the inflammatory, oxidative and apoptotic aberrations.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The present study investigates the efficacy of tryptanthrin, a bioactive compound in indigo naturalis, against non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and the signalling events involved.Efficacy of tryptanthrin against NMSC was assessed using DMBA/PMA-induced skin carcinogenesis model in Swiss albino mice. Immunostaining for PCNA and ki-67 was used to mark proliferating cells in tissues. Haematoxylin and eosin staining and toluidine staining were employed to assess , and TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptosis in tissues. The signalling events were evaluated using Western blot, imunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. MTT assay and clonogenic assay were performed to assess the viability and proliferation of cancer cells, in vitro.In mice, topical application of tryptanthrin suppressed skin carcinogenesis. It attenuated , impeded the proliferation of hair follicle (HF) cells and suppressed the activation of β-catenin, a major driver of HF cell proliferation. Additionally tryptanthrin suppressed the activation of ERK1/ and p38, both of which promote β-catenin activation and lowered the expression of c-Myc and cyclin-D1. Tryptanthrin suppressed the proliferation of the human NMSC cell line, A431 and abrogated EGF-induced activation of β-catenin and subsequent cytoskeletal rearrangement.The study demonstrates with molecular evidence that tryptanthrin is an effective suppressor of NMSC.© 2019 The Authors.
