<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25841205> fate of cardiac glycosides and flavonoids upon fermentation of aqueous sea squill (Drimia maritima L.) extracts.</a></h2><p>Sea squill (Drimia maritima L.) extracts have been used for centuries for the medical treatment of heart diseases. A procedure for the preparation of Drimia extracts applied for such purposes comprising a fermentation step is described in the German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia (GHP). However, little is known about the secondary metabolite profile of such extracts and the fate of these components upon processing and storage. Thus, in the present study sea squill extracts were monitored during fermentation and storage by HPLC-DAD-MS(n) and GC-MS to characterise and quantitate individual cardiac glycosides and phenolic compounds. For this purpose, a previously established HPLC method for the separation and quantitation of pharmacologically relevant cardiac glycosides (bufadienolides) was validated. Within 12 months of storage, total  contents decreased by about 50%, which was attributed to microbial and plant enzyme activities. The metabolisation and degradation rates of individual  glycosides significantly differed, which was attributed to differing structures of the aglycones. Further degradation of  aglycones was also observed. Besides reactions well known from human  studies, dehydration of individual compounds was monitored. Quantitatively predominating flavonoids were also metabolised throughout the fermentation process. The present study provides valuable information about the profile and stability of individual cardiac glycosides and phenolic compounds in fermented Drimia extracts prepared for medical applications, and expands the knowledge of cardiac glycoside conversion upon microbial fermentation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Among four  compounds, a dose-dependent cytotoxicity was observed in these cancer cells after treatment with gamabufotalin and arenobufagin. The IC50 values of the two compounds were 3-5 times higher in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than these values for both cancer cell lines. However, similar phenomena were not observed for two other  compounds, telocinobufagin and bufalin. These results thus suggest that gamabufotalin and arenobufagin possess selective cytotoxic activity against tumor cells rather than normal cells. Moreover, a clear dose-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, a well-known hallmark of necrosis, was observed in both cancer cells treated with gamabufotalin, suggesting that gamabufotalin-mediated cell death is predominantly associated with a necrosis-like phenotype. Of most importance, treatment with as little as 8 ng/ml of gamabufotalin, even an almost non-toxic concentration to PBMCs, efficiently downregulated the percentages of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulator T (Treg) cells in mitogen-activated PBMCs. Given that Treg cells play a critical role in tumor immunotolerance by suppressing antitumor , these results suggest that gamabufotalin may serve as a promising candidate, as an adjuvant therapeutic agent by manipulating Treg cells to enhance the efficacy of conventional anticancer drugs and lessen their side-effects. These findings provide insights into the clinical application of gamabufotalin for cancer patients with glioblastoma/pancreatic cancer based on its cytocidal effect against tumor cells as well as its depletion of Treg cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26485758>Arenobufagin intercalates with DNA leading to G2 cell cycle arrest via ATM/ATR pathway.</a></h2><p>Arenobufagin, a representative , is the major active component in the traditional Chinese medicine Chan'su. It possesses significant antineoplastic activity in vitro. Although  has been found to disrupt the cell cycle, the underlying mechanisms of this disruption are not defined. Here, we reported that arenobufagin blocked the transition from G2 to M phase of cell cycle through inhibiting the activation of CDK1-Cyclin B1 complex; The tumor suppressor p53 contributed to sustaining arrest at the G2 phase of the cell cycle in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Moreover, arenobufagin caused double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) and triggered the DNA damage response (DDR), partly via the ATM/ATR-Chk1/Chk2-Cdc25C signaling pathway. Importantly, we used a synthetic biotinylated arenobufagin-conjugated chemical probe in live cells to show that arenobufagin accumulated mainly in the nucleus. The microscopic thermodynamic parameters measured using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) also demonstrated that arenobufagin directly bound to DNA in vitro. The hypochromicity in the UV-visible absorption spectrum, the significant changes in the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of DNA, and the distinct quenching in the fluorescence intensity of the ethidium bromide (EB)-DNA system before and after arenobufagin treatment indicated that arenobufagin bound to DNA in vitro by intercalation. Molecular modeling suggested arenobufagin intercalated with DNA via hydrogen bonds between arenobufagin and GT base pairs. Collectively, these data provide novel insights into arenobufagin-induced cell cycle disruption that are valuable for the further discussion and investigation of the use of arenobufagin in clinical anticancer chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26577491>Identification of the hydroxylated derivatives of bufalin: phase I metabolites in rats.</a></h2><p>Bufalin was a typical bioactive , existed in the traditional Chinese medicine Chan Su with the high content of 1-5%. The in vivo metabolites (1-5) of bufalin were prepared by various chromatographic techniques from the bile samples of SD rats, which were administrated with bufalin orally. Their structures were determined on the basis of the widely spectroscopic data, including HRESIMS, 1D-, and 2D NMR. And 1-3, 5 were new compounds. In the in vitro cytotoxicity assay, metabolites (1-5) showed weaker cytotoxic effects than bufalin against human cancer cell lines A549 and H1299, which indicated that the  was a significant pathway for the detoxification of bufalin. Structures analyses indicated that metabolites 1-5 were hydroxylated derivatives of bufalin. This study suggested that Phase I  catalyzed by CYP450 enzymes was one of the  ways of bufalin, which may promote the excretion of bufalin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26657289>Gamabufotalin, a major derivative of , inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis by suppressing VEGFR-2 signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Gamabufotalin (CS-6), a main active compound isolated from Chinese medicine Chansu, has been shown to strongly inhibit cancer cell growth and inflammatory response. However, its effects on angiogenesis have not been known yet. Here, we sought to determine the biological effects of CS-6 on signaling mechanisms during angiogenesis. Our present results fully demonstrate that CS-6 could significantly inhibit VEGF triggered HUVECs proliferation, migration, invasion and tubulogenesis in vitro and blocked vascularization in Matrigel plugs impregnated in C57/BL6 mice as well as reduced vessel density in human lung tumor xenograft implanted in nude mice. Computer simulations revealed that CS-6 interacted with the ATP-binding sites of VEGFR-2 using molecular docking. Furthermore, western blot analysis indicated that CS-6 inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 kinase and suppressed the activity of VEGFR-2-mediated signaling cascades. Therefore, our studies demonstrated that CS-6 inhibited angiogenesis by inhibiting the activation of VEGFR-2 signaling  and CS-6 could be a potential candidate in angiogenesis-related disease therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26869342>Metabolites profiling of 10 bufadienolides in human liver microsomes and their cytotoxicity variation in HepG2 cell.</a></h2><p>Bufadienolides, a class of polyhydroxy steroids, exhibit significant antitumor activity. In this study, a total of 39 metabolites from 10 bufadienolides were detected and identified by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The results showed that hydroxylation and dehydrogenation were the major   of bufadienolides in human liver microsomes (HLMs). CYP3A4 was found to be the major  enzyme and CYP2D6 only mediated the dehydrogenation reaction. A systematic validated cytotoxicity evaluation method for  metabolites at equal equivalents was established. Hellebrigenin (1), hellebrigenol (2), arenobufagin (3), bufotalin (5), and bufalin (6) were selected to determine their cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells before and after incubation in HLMs. All the test samples were enriched by a validated solid-phase extraction (SPE) method. Although the cytotoxicities of metabolites were weaker than those of the parent compounds to different degrees, their effects were still strong.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26662961>The effects of bufadienolides on HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cells.</a></h2><p>HER2 is a proto-oncogene frequently amplified in human breast cancer, its overexpression is correlated with tamoxifen resistance and decreased recurrence-free survival. Arenobufagin and bufalin are homogeneous bufadienolides of cardiac glycosides agents. In this research, we studied the effects of arenobufagin and bufalin on cellular survival and proliferation of HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cells and the mechanism under the results including the direct effect on HER2 downstream . Our results showed that arenobufagin and bufalin could significantly inhibit the proliferation and survival of HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cells, along with the declination of SRC-1, SRC-3, nuclear transcription factor E2F1, phosphorylated AKT, and ERK. And the combination of each  in low dose with tamoxifen could significantly enhance the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cells. All above suggest that arenobufagin and bufalin may be potential therapy adjuvants for HER2 overexpressing breast cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27428326>Proteasome Inhibition Contributed to the Cytotoxicity of Arenobufagin after Its Binding with Na, K-ATPase in Human Cervical Carcinoma HeLa Cells.</a></h2><p>Although the possibility of developing cardiac steroids/cardiac glycosides as novel cancer therapeutic agents has been recognized, the mechanism of their anticancer activity is still not clear enough. Toad venom extract containing bufadienolides, which belong to cardiac steroids, has actually long been used as traditional Chinese medicine in clinic for cancer therapy in China. The cytotoxicity of arenobufagin, a  isolated from toad venom, on human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells was checked. And, the protein expression profile of control HeLa cells and HeLa cells treated with arenobufagin for 48 h was analyzed using two-dimensional electrophoresis, respectively. Differently expressed proteins in HeLa cells treated with arenobufagin were identified and the pathways related to these proteins were mapped from KEGG database. Computational molecular docking was performed to verify the binding of arenobufagin and Na, K-ATPase. The effects of arenobufagin on Na, K-ATPase activity and proteasome activity of HeLa cells were checked. The protein-protein interaction network between Na, K-ATPase and proteasome was constructed and the expression of possible intermediate proteins ataxin-1 and translationally-controlled tumor protein in HeLa cells treated with arenobufagin was then checked. Arenobufagin induced apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest in HeLa cells. The cytotoxic effect of arenobufagin was associated with 25 differently expressed proteins including proteasome-related proteins, calcium ion binding-related proteins, oxidative stress-related proteins, metabolism-related enzymes and others. The results of computational molecular docking revealed that arenobufagin was bound in the cavity formed by the transmembrane alpha subunits of Na, K-ATPase, which blocked the pathway of extracellular Na+/K+ cation exchange and inhibited the function of ion exchange. Arenobufagin inhibited the activity of Na, K-ATPase and proteasome, decreased the expression of Na, K-ATPase α1 and α3 subunits and increased the expression of WEE1 in HeLa cells. Antibodies against Na, K-ATPase α1 and α3 subunits alone or combinated with arenobufagin also inhibited the activity of proteasome. Furthermore, the expression of the possible intermediate proteins ataxin-1 and translationally-controlled tumor protein was increased in HeLa cells treated with arenobufagin by flow cytometry analysis, respectively. These results indicated that arenobufagin might directly bind with Na, K-ATPase α1 and α3 subunits and the inhibitive effect of arenobufagin on proteasomal activity of HeLa cells might be related to its binding with Na, K-ATPase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26905927>Mutations to the cardiotonic steroid binding site of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase are associated with high level of resistance to gamabufotalin in a natricine snake.</a></h2><p>Although toads are defended by  toxins, some snakes have evolved resistance to bufadienolides and feed heavily on toads. We compared resistance in Nerodia rhombifer, which possesses mutations that confer target-site resistance, to Pituophis catenifer, which lacks those mutations. Even at the highest dosage tested, Nerodia showed no effects, whereas the lowest dose was lethal to Pituophis.

Research shows that the main anti-tumor components in .  have free type structure and conjunct type structure. To identify and clarify the difference between bufogenin and bufotoxin contained in Bufonis Venenum, which was from B. bufo gargarizans, an UPLC-TQ-MS method has been established. UPLC-TQ-MS method was used to identify and quantify the major bufadienolides in Bufonis Venenum. UPLC-TQ-MS assay with positive ion mode was performed on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C, (2.1 mm x 100 mm, 1.7 µm) with the mobile phase consisting of 0. 1% aqueous formic and acidacetonitrile in gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.4 mL · min⁻¹ and the column temperature was set at 35 °C. By comparing their retention time and high resolution mass data of Bufonis Venenum extracts, 37 effective components were primarily identified by MS/MS analysis in positive ion mode. Twenty-six of them were free-type bufadienolides (bufogenin), 11 of them were conjugated bufadienolides. There were significant differences in the main composition between fresh and processed Bufonis Venenum. The study found that the chemical composition of toad venom through great changes after processing, conjunct type content is much less, free type content as well change.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28249773>Toad toxin-resistant snake (Thamnophis elegans) expresses high levels of mutant Na/K-ATPase mRNA in cardiac muscle.</a></h2><p>Toads are chemically defended by bufadienolides, which are lethal to most predators. These toxins exert their lethal effects by binding to and disabling the Na/K-ATPases of cell membranes. Many species of snakes exhibit resistance to the effects of bufadienolides due to target-site insensitivity of the Na/K-ATPase. Mutations that confer resistance have previously been identified in ATP1a3, the gene that codes for the Na/K-ATPase α-3 paralog. We have found that this mutant gene is expressed at a significantly elevated level in heart tissue compared to gut, kidney, and liver of the -resistant snake, Thamnophis elegans. Furthermore, we found that exposure to bufadienolides elicits a significant increase in the expression levels of ATP1a3 in the heart, but not in the kidneys, liver, or gut 1h after exposure. We suggest that upregulation of ATP1a3 in the heart plays an important role in the physiological processes involved in tolerance of bufadienolides among genetically resistant snakes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report that resibufogenin, a member of  family, suppresses the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC) through induction of necroptosis in vivo.SW480 cells with stably expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein were xenografted to BALB/c-nu mice to observe the growth of tumors. Liver metastasis was observed by injection of MC38 cells beneath the splenic capsule of mice. Protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and western blot.Consolidated in vitro results indicate that resibufogenin has anti-proliferative activity on CRC cells. PI staining and transmission electron microscope imaging suggest that the cell death induced by resibufogenin are mainly through necrosis, which is further confirmed by the ineffectiveness of z-VAD, a pan-caspase general inhibitor. In particular, resibufogenin induced necrosis is substantially abrogated in receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts. The RIP3-dependent necrosis has been classified as necroptosis. Resibufogenin triggeres necroptosis through upregulating RIP3 and phosphorylating mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein at Ser358. Resibufogenin also activates the expression of PYGL, GLUD1 and GLUL in a RIP3-dependent manner. Resibufogenin exerts cytotoxic effect by inducing reactive oxygen species accumulation which can be neutralized by N-acetylcysteine. Remarkably, resibufogenin significantly suppresses liver-metastasis from spleen implantation. The anti-neoplastic effect of this compound can be abrogated by RIP3 knockdown.Resibufogenin suppresses growth and metastasis of CRC through RIP3-mediated necroptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30261260>Bufadienolides from Kalanchoe daigremontiana modulate the enzymatic activity of plasmin - In vitro and in silico analyses.</a></h2><p>Plasmin (EC 3.4.21.7) is a key enzyme of the fibrinolytic system, responsible for the degradation of fibrin clot and maintaining blood fluidity. Hence, alterations of the fibrinolytic capacity of blood plasma may contribute to thrombotic or bleeding complications. The aim of this study was to determine effects of a -rich fraction, isolated from roots of Kalanchoe daigremontiana (0.05-50 μg/ml) on enzymatic properties of plasmin. Hydrolysis of a synthetic substrate S-2251 (H-D-Valyl-l-leucyl-l-lysine-p-nitroaniline dihydrochloride) by plasmin revealed that the -rich fraction had a diverse effect on this enzyme, dependently on the concentration range. While the lower concentrations of the examined fraction (0.05-2.5 μg/ml) significantly enhanced the amidolytic activity of plasmin, at 25-50 μg/ml concentrations, the enzyme was evidently inhibited (by about 60%). The Lineweaver-Burk plot indicated on an uncompetitive inhibition of plasmin. Inhibitory effects (up to 80%) were also found in the streptokinase-induced plasminogen activation to plasmin. Docking results suggest that only some of compounds (mostly bersaldegenin 1-acetate (10), bryotoxin (13) and hovetrichoside C (17)) were bound to plasminogen/plasmin, depending on the presence or absence of the substrate in the active site. The obtained findings suggest allosteric regulation of plasminogen activation and plasmin activity by components of the examined fraction.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, different herbal extracts used in phytotherapy have been screened after searching innovative natural anti-cancer components.Twenty steroid glycosides were examined for accordance to their potential of inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in the osteosarcoma cell line 143B. Cell proliferation was examined using a CASY counter. Effects of cardiac glycosides on induction of apoptosis were evaluated by Annexin V-APC and flow cytometry, caspase activity assay and measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential.The study revealed that various steroid glycosides suppress cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Further investigations indicated apoptotic induction by 17 of the 20 tested cardenolides and bufadienolides.  proscillaridin A, arenobufagin, and cardenolides evomonoside, convallatoxol and ouabain waged strongest apoptotic induction, associated with breakdown of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspases -8 and -9. In contrast, the  resibufogenin and cardenolide uzarin had no effect on proliferation inhibition, apoptotic induction or change in mitochondrial membrane potential.These results indicate that bufadienolides proscillaridin A and arenobufagin and cardenolide evomonoside, or related natural compounds might be promising new starting points for development of novel anti-cancer agents for treatment of osteosarcoma.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28666968>In vitro phase I  of gamabufotalin and arenobufagin: Reveal the effect of substituent group on  stability.</a></h2><p>Bufadienolides are a major class of bioactive compounds derived from amphibian skin secretion.

Two mono-hydroxylated products of GB and AB were detected in the incubation mixtures, and they were accurately identified as 1- and 5-hydroxylated bufadienolides by NMR and HPLC-MS techniques. Reaction phenotyping studies demonstrated that CYP3A mediated the  of the two bufadienolides with a high specific selectivity. Further kinetic evaluation demonstrated that the  stability of GB and AB were better than other reported bufadienolides. Additionally, the CYP3A5 preference for hydroxylation of AB was observed, which was different to the selectivity of CYP3As for bufadienolides suggested by our previous report.

Neovascularization is a surprisingly early event during the multistage progression of cancer. Cinobufagin, an important  originating from Chan Su, has been clinically used to treat cancer in China since the Tang dynasty. Here, we show that cinobufagin suppresses colorectal cancer (CRC) growth in vivo by downregulating angiogenesis. The hierarchized neovasculature is significantly decreased and the vascular network formation is disrupted in HUVEC by cinobufagin in a dose-dependent way. Endothelial apoptosis is observed by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction which can be neutralized by N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). Expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) is reduced and phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2481 and Akt at Ser473 is downregulated in HUVEC. Endothelial apoptosis is triggered by cinobufagin by stimulation of Bax and cascade activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3. Increased endothelial apoptosis rate and alterations in the HIF-1α/mTOR pathway are recapitulated in tumor-bearing mice in vivo. Further, the anti-angiogenesis function of cinobufagin is consolidated based on its pro-apoptotic effects on an EOMA-derived hemangioendothelioma model. In conclusion, cinobufagin suppresses tumor neovascularization by disrupting the endothelial mTOR/HIF-1α pathway to trigger ROS-mediated vascular endothelial cell apoptosis. Cinobufagin is a promising natural anti-angiogenetic drug that has clinical translation potential and practical application value.© 2019 The Authors.

This study aimed to character the  pathway(s) of BFT and to identify the key drug metabolizing enzyme(s) responsible for hepatic  of BFT in human, as well as to explore the related molecular mechanism of enzymatic selectivity. The major metabolite of BFT in human liver microsomes (HLMs) was fully identified as 5β-hydroxylbufotalin by LC-MS/MS and NMR techniques. Reaction phenotyping and chemical inhibition assays showed that CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were key enzymes responsible for BFT 5β-hydroxylation. Kinetic analyses demonstrated that BFT 5β-hydroxylation in both HLMs and human CYP3A4 followed the biphasic kinetics, while BFT 5β-hydroxylation in CYP3A5 followed substrate inhibition kinetics. Furthermore, molecular docking simulations showed that BFT could bind on two different ligand-binding sites on both CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, which partially explained the different kinetic behaviors of BFT in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. These findings are very helpful for elucidating the phase I  of BFT in human and for deeper understanding the key interactions between CYP3A enzymes and bufadienolides, as well as for the development of -type drugs with improved pharmacokinetic and safety profiles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30181060>Hybrids of arenobufagin and benzoisoselenazol reducing the cardiotoxicity of arenobufagin.</a></h2><p>Arenobufagin is a naturally occurring  showing promising antitumor activity accompanied however with apparent cardiac toxicity. Following the recent discovery that oxidative damage possibly be an important cause of the cardiac toxicity of cardenolides, a strategy fusing the antitumor agent arenobufagin with a benzoisoselenazol fragment, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, has been developed. Six novel hybrids were synthesized and their ROS scavenging activities as well as their in vitro cytotoxicity against the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, an adriamycin-resistant subline HepG2/ADM, and the human myocardial cell line AC16 were evaluated. The results indicate that the hybrids exhibit various degrees of in vitro ROS scavenging activities, and weaker cytotoxicity than that of arenobufagin against the myocardial cell line AC16. These findings suggest the feasibility of a strategy in which the cardiotoxicity of the potential antitumor agent arenobufagin is reduced.Copyright © 2018.

Marinobufagenin binding to Na/K-ATPase initiates profibrotic cell signaling, and heightened marinobufagenin levels are implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension, preeclampsia, and chronic kidney disease. Steroids are derived from cholesterol through the traditional steroidogenesis pathway initiated by enzyme CYP11A1, and via the acidic bile acid pathway, which is controlled by enzyme CYP27A1. The mechanism of marinobufagenin biosynthesis in mammals, however, remains unknown.Here, we show that post-transcriptional silencing of the CYP27A1 gene in human trophoblast and rat adrenocortical cells reduced the expression of CYP27A1 mRNA by 70%, reduced total bile acids 2-fold, and marinobufagenin levels by 67% when compared with nontreated cells or cells transfected with nontargeting siRNA. In contrast, silencing of the CYP11A1 gene did not affect marinobufagenin production in either cell culture, but suppressed production of progesterone 2-fold in human trophoblast cells and of corticosterone by 90% in rat adrenocortical cells when compared with cells transfected with nontargeting siRNA. In vivo, in a high-salt administration experiment, male and female Dahl salt-sensitive rats became hypertensive after 4 weeks on a high-NaCl diet, their plasma marinobufagenin levels doubled, and adrenocortical CYP27A1 mRNA and protein increased 1.6-fold and 2.0-fold.Therefore, the endogenous steroidal Na/K-ATPase inhibitor, marinobufagenin, is synthesized in mammalian placenta and adrenal cortex from cholesterol through the novel acidic bile acid pathway.

The aim of this study is to investigate the anticancer activity of cinobufotalin, a  isolated from toad venom, in cultured HCC cells, and to study the underlying mechanisms. We found that cinobufotalin (at nmol/L) significantly inhibited HCC cell growth and survival while inducing considerable cell apoptosis. Further, cinobufotalin inhibited sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) activity and induced pro-apoptotic ceramide production. Ceramide synthase-1 small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-depletion inhibited cinobufotalin-induced ceramide production and HCC cell apoptosis. On the other hand, the glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitor 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) facilitated cinobufotalin-induced ceramide production and cell apoptosis. SphK1 inhibitor II (SKI-II), similar to cinobufotalin, increased cellular ceramide level and promoted HCC cell apoptosis. Finally, we observed that cinobufotalin inactivated Akt-S6K1 signaling in HepG2 cells, which was again inhibited by ceramide synthase-1 shRNA-depletion.

We identified three bufadienolides-the steroid-like compounds arenobufagin, gamabufotalin, and telocinobufagin-from the boreal toad, Anaxyrus boreas, through liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Compounds were detected both after inducing skin gland secretions and in constitutive mucosal rinses from toads. We described the antimicrobial properties of each  against Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), an amphibian fungal pathogen linked with boreal toad population declines. All three bufadienolides were found to inhibit Bd growth at similar levels. The maximum Bd inhibition produced by arenobufagin, gamabufotalin, and telocinobufagin were approximately 50%, in contrast to the complete Bd inhibition shown by antimicrobial skin peptides produced by some amphibian species. In addition, skin mucus samples significantly reduced Bd viability, and bufadienolides were detected in 15 of 62 samples. Bufadienolides also appeared to enhance growth of the anti-Bd bacterium Janthinobacterium lividum, and thus may be involved in regulation of the skin microbiome. Here, we localized skin bacteria within the mucus layer and granular glands of toads with fluorescent in situ hybridization. Overall, our results suggest that bufadienolides can function in antifungal defense on amphibian skin and their production is a potentially convergent trait similar to antimicrobial peptide defenses found on the skin of other species. Further studies investigating  expression across toad populations, their regulation, and interactions with other components of the skin mucosome will contribute to understanding the complexities of amphibian immune defense.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28347742>Corticosteroid responses of snakes to toxins from toads (bufadienolides) and plants (cardenolides) reflect differences in dietary specializations.</a></h2><p>Toads are chemically defended by cardiotonic steroids known as bufadienolides. Resistance to the acute effects of bufadienolides in snakes that prey on toads is conferred by target-site insensitivity of the toxin's target enzyme, the Na/K-ATPase. Previous studies have focused largely on the molecular mechanisms of resistance but have not investigated the physiological mechanisms or consequences of exposure to the toxins. Adrenal enlargement in snakes often is associated with specialization on a diet of toads. These endocrine glands are partly composed of interrenal tissue, which produces the corticosteroids corticosterone and aldosterone. Corticosterone is the main hormone released in response to stress in reptiles, and aldosterone plays an important role in maintaining ion balance through upregulation of Na/K-ATPase. We tested the endocrine response of select species of snakes to acute cardiotonic steroid exposure by measuring circulating aldosterone and corticosterone concentrations. We found that Rhabdophis tigrinus, which specializes on a diet of toads, responds with lower corticosterone and higher aldosterone compared to other species that exhibit target-site resistance to the toxins but do not specialize on toads. We also found differences between sexes in R. tigrinus, with males generally responding with higher corticosterone and aldosterone than females. This study provides evidence of physiological adaptations, beyond target-site resistance, associated with tolerance of bufadienolides in a specialized toad-eating snake.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with WEHI-3 cells to develop leukemia and then were treated with oral treatment with bufalin at different doses (0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. At the end of treatment, all mice were weighted and blood was collected; liver and spleen tissues were collected for cell marker, phagocytosis, natural killer (NK) cell activity and T- and B-cell proliferation measurements by using flow cytometric assays.When compared with the leukemia control group, bufalin increased the body weight, but reduced liver and spleen weights, and reduced CD3, CD16 and Mac-3 cell markers at 0.4 mg/kg treatment and increased CD11b marker at 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg treatment. Furthermore, bufalin at 0.4 mg/kg increased phagocytosis by macrophages isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and at 0.1 mg/kg by those from the peritoneal cavity. Bufalin (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) increased NK cell cytotoxic activity at effector:target ratio of 50:1. Bufalin increased B-cell proliferation at 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg treatment but only increased T-cell proliferation at 0.1 mg/kg. Bufalin increased glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase level at all dose treatments, increased glutamic pyruvic transaminase level only at 0.1 mg/kg treatment, but reduced the level of lactate dehydrogenase at all dose levels in mice with WEHI-3 cell-induced leukemia in vivo.Bufalin increased immune responses by enhancing phagocytosis in mice with leukemia mice.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

For that reason, this protein is also a crucial target for different anti-thrombotic therapies. The work is based on in vitro evaluation of the inhibitory effect of -rich fraction, isolated from roots of Kalanchoe daigremontiana (1-50μg/ml) on enzymatic properties of a serine proteinase - thrombin. The efficacy of the inhibition of amidolytic activity of thrombin (measured as a hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate S-2238, Chromogenix) attained about 10 and 66%, respectively. The IC, established for the examined  fraction was 2.79μg/ml, while the IC calculated for argatroban (reference compound) was 0.78μg/ml. Linearization conducted using Lineweaver-Burk plot indicated that the K. daigremontiana fraction contains compounds that are uncompetitive inhibitors of thrombin. K. daigremontiana fraction was also able to reduce the proteolytic activity of thrombin towards its physiological substrate, i.e. fibrinogen. Additionally, this study is supported by in silico analysis of interactions of the most common compounds, identified in the examined in Kalanchoe extract to crystal structure of this enzyme.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to dietary alkaloids, -like compounds and indolealkylamines have been identified in certain species of Melanophryniscus. Our study reports, for the first time, the co-occurrence of large quantities of both alkaloids sequestered from the diet and an endogenously biosynthesized indolalkylamine in skin secretions from individual specimens of Melanophryniscus moreirae from Brazil. GC/MS analysis of 55 individuals of M. moreirae revealed 37 dietary alkaloids and the biosynthesized indolealkylamine bufotenine. On average, pumiliotoxin 267C, bufotenine, and allopumilitoxin 323B collectively represent ca. 90 % of the defensive chemicals present in an individual. The quantity of defensive chemicals differed between sexes, with males possessing significantly less dietary alkaloid and bufotenine than females. Most of the dietary alkaloids have structures with branched-chains, indicating they are likely derived from oribatid mites. The ratio of bufotenine:alkaloid quantity decreased with increasing quantities of dietary alkaloids, suggesting that M. moreirae might regulate bufotenine synthesis in relation to sequestration of dietary alkaloids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29853035>Revealing of endogenous Marinobufagin by an ultra-specific and sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS assay in pregnant women.</a></h2><p>Marinobufagenin (MBG) is a  cardiac inotrope implicated in volume expansion-mediated hypertensive states including essential hypertension and preeclampsia (PE). Endogenous MBG is an inhibitor of the α1-isoform of Na,K-ATPase with vasoconstrictive and cardiotonic properties, causing hypertension and natriuresis. Elevated endogenous MBG-like material levels have been described by immunoassays in salt-sensitive pregnant and preeclamptic rats as well as in preeclamptic human patients. The rise of endogenous MBG-like material appears prior the development of the main symptoms of PE, leading us to consider MBG as one of the potential biomarkers for PE. The weak specificity and the high variability of the published immunoassays gives no certification about endogenous MBG existence. This led us to set-up a highly specific and sensitive analytical method to detect MBG in plasma at low levels relying on liquid chromatography combined to mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) with recording of 7 highly specific MRM transitions for MBG. Pure MBG standard used in the method development was obtained by purification from the Bufo marinus toad venom. d-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was used as internal standard. An increasing organic gradient with mobile phase A and B composed of 97:3 (v/v) HO: MeOH and 50:45:5 (v/v/v) MeOH:IPA:HO at pH 4.5 respectively was used on a Pursuit 3 PFP column (100 mm × 3 mm; 3 µm) to allow elution and separation of the plasmatic compounds. Chromatographic analyses of plasma samples were preceded by a precipitation of proteins pretreatment. The developed UHPLC-MS/MS assay has been applied to early-pregnant women plasma samples allowing us to investigate MBG plasma levels. Thanks to the high specificity of the assay we were able to authenticate and certify the presence of endogenous MBG in early-pregnant women plasma with the use of the 7 selected specific mass transitions. These pioneering preliminary results are giving a promising perspective for early preeclampsia risk assessment in pregnant women.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The preparation sold in the capital city of Paraguay to treat cancer that is advertised as made using the toad was analyzed by HPLC-MS-MS. The effect of the R. schneideri venom and the preparation was investigated on human breast cancer cells. The antiprotozoal activity was evaluated on Leishmania braziliensis, L. infantum and murine macrophages.From the venoms of R. ornata, R. schneideri and R. scitula, some 40 compounds were identified by spectroscopic and spectrometric means. Several minor constituents are reported for the first time. The preparation sold as made from the toad did not contained bufadienolides or compounds that can be associated with the toad but plant compounds, mainly phenolics and flavonoids. The venom showed activity on human breast cancer cells and modified the cell cycle proliferation. The antiprotozoal effect was higher for the R. schneideri venom and can be related to the composition and relative ratio of constituents compared with R. ornata and R. scitula.The preparation sold in the capital city of Paraguay as containing the toad venom, used popularly to treat cancer did not contain the toad venom constituents. Consistent with this, this preparation was inactive on proliferation of human breast cancer cells. In contrast, the toad venoms of Rhinella species altered the cell cycle progression, affecting the proliferation of malignant cells. The findings suggest that care should be taken with the providers of the preparation and that the crude drug present a strong activity towards human breast cancer cell lines. The antiprotozoal effect of the R. schneideri venom was moderate while the venom of R. ornata was devoid of activity and that of R. scitula was active at very high concentration.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This study assessed the cell-specific effect of CINO on SK-OV-3, CRL-1978 and CRL-11731 ovarian cancer cells which differ in terms of their respective karyotypes.Cell cultures were treated with CINO (0.1, 1, 5 and 10 μM) for 24, 48, and 72 h. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were measured using CellTiter, Cytoselect, and FluoroBlock assays, respectively. Expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was evaluated by western blot analysis. Cell viability was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Immunofluorescence was performed using Annexin-V staining and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was measured using MitoTracker™ Red.CINO at 0.5 μM inhibited SK-OV-3, CRL-1978, and CRL-11731 proliferation, migration, and invasion.

However, we generally know little about the energy- and time-demands of developing toxicity in animals, which determines the efficiency of chemical defence and its trade-off with other risk-induced phenotypic responses. In this study we examined how immersion into norepinephrine solution inducing the release of stored toxins, administration of mild stress mimicking predator attack or simple handling during experimental procedure affected the quantity and number of toxin compounds present in common toad (Bufo bufo) tadpoles as compared to undisturbed control individuals, and investigated how fast toxin reserves were restored. We found that total  quantity (TBQ) significantly decreased only in the norepinephrine treatment group immediately after treatment compared to the control, but this difference disappeared after 12 h; there were no consistent differences in TBQ between treatments at later samplings. Interestingly, in the norepinephrine treatment approximately half of the compounds characterized by >700 m/z values showed the same changes in time as TBQ, but several bufadienolides characterized by <600 m/z values showed the opposite pattern: they were present in higher quantities immediately after treatment. The number of  compounds was not affected by any treatments, but was positively related to TBQ. Our study represents the first experimental evidence that toxin quantities returned to the original level following induced toxin release within a very short period of time in common toad tadpoles and provide additional insights into the physiological background of chemical defence in this model vertebrate species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27384878>Quantitative proteomics reveals molecular mechanism of gamabufotalin and its potential inhibition on Hsp90 in lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Gamabufotalin (CS-6) is a major  of Chansu, which shows desirable metabolic stability and less adverse effect in cancer therapy. CS-6 treatment inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC in a nanomolar range. And CS-6 could induce G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in A549 cells. However, its molecular mechanism in antitumor activity remains poorly understood. We employed a quantitative proteomics approach to identify the potential cellular targets of CS-6, and found 38 possible target-related proteins. Among them, 31 proteins were closely related in the protein-protein interaction network. One of the regulatory nodes in key pathways was occupied by Hsp90. Molecular docking revealed that CS-6 interacted with the ATP-binding sites of Hsp90. In addition, CS-6 inhibited the chaperone function of Hsp90 and reduced expression of Hsp90-dependent client proteins. Moreover, CS-6 markedly down-regulated the protein level of Hsp90 in tumor tissues of the xenograft mice. Taken together, our results suggest that CS-6 might be a novel inhibitor of Hsp90, and the possible network associated with CS-6 target-related proteins was constructed, which provided experimental evidence for the preclinical value of using CS-6 as an effective antitumor agent in treatment of NSCLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28595013>Fibroblast Activation Protein α Activated Tripeptide  Antitumor Prodrug with Reduced Cardiotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Bufadienolides are the major pharmacologic constituents of traditional Chinese medicine Chan'su, which is frequently used clinically for cancer treatment in China. Motivated by reducing or avoiding the cardiac toxicity of bufadienolides, we have designed, synthesized, and evaluated the fibroblast activation protein α (FAPα) activated tripeptide arenobufagin prodrugs with the purpose of improving the safety of arenobufagin (a representative ). Among these FAPα-activated prodrugs, 3f exhibited the best hydrolytic efficiency by recombinant human FAPα (rhFAPα) and was activated in tumors. The LD of 3f was 6.5-fold higher than that of arenobufagin. We also observed that there are nonapparent changes in echocardiography, pathological section of cardiac muscle, and the lactate dehydrogenase activities (LDH) in 3f-treatment tumor-bearing mice, even when the dose reached 3 times the amount of parent drug arenobufagin that was used. Compound 3f also exhibits significant antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. The improved safety profile and favorable anticancer properties of 3f warrant further studies of the potential clinical implications.

To provide a novel insight into therapeutic strategies against glioblastoma, the cytotoxicity of arenobufagin and hellebrigenin was investigated in the human glioblastoma cell line, U-87. Similar dose-dependent cytotoxicity was observed in the cells, whereas no detectable toxicity was confirmed in mouse primary astrocytes. Treatment with each drug downregulated the expression levels of Cdc25C, Cyclin B1 and survivin, which occurred in parallel with G2/M phase arrest. Necrotic-like cell death was only observed in the cells treated with a relatively high concentration (>100 ng/ml). These results indicate that the two drugs exhibited distinct cytotoxicity against cancerous glial cells with high potency and selectivity, suggesting that growth inhibition associated with G2/M phase arrest and/or necrosis were attributed to their toxicities. Activation of the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was also observed in treated cells. Notably, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB203580, itself caused a significant decrease in cell viability, and further enhanced the cytotoxicity of the two drugs, suggesting an important pro-survival role for p38 MAPK. Given that p38 MAPK serves an essential role in promoting glioblastoma cell survival, developing a novel combination regimen of arenobufagin/hellebrigenin plus a p38 MAPK inhibitor may improve the efficacy of the two drugs, and may provide more therapeutic benefits to patients with glioblastoma. The qualitative assessment demonstrated the existence of arenobufagin in the cerebrospinal fluid of arenobufagin-treated rats, supporting its clinical application.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28260175>Involvement of the Bufadienolides in the Detection and Therapy of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.</a></h2><p>The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents a major challenge for clinicians as well as basic scientists. The mortality rate for ARDS has been maintained within the range of 40-52%. The authors have examined the involvement of the "cardiotonic steroids" in the pathogenesis and therapy of ARDS. We have studied the possible role of the , marinobufagenin (MBG), in the pathogenesis of ARDS in both a rat model of ARDS and in patients afflicted with that disorder. In addition, the potential therapeutic benefit of an antagonist of MBG, resibufogenin (RBG), in an animal model has been evaluated.A syndrome resembling human ARDS was produced in the rat by exposing the animals to 100% oxygen for 48 h. In other animals, RBG was administered to these "hyperoxic" rats, and the serum MBG was measured. In human ICU patients, urinary samples were examined for levels of MBG, and the values were compared to those obtained from other ICU patients admitted with diagnoses other than ARDS.(1) Exposure of rats to hyperoxia produced a histologic picture which resembled that of human ARDS. (2) Serum levels of MBG in the "hyperoxic" rats substantially exceeded those obtained in animals exposed to ambient oxygen levels and were reduced to normal by RBG. (3) In ARDS patients, substantial elevations in urinary MBG were obtained compared to those in non-ARDS ICU patients.MBG may serve as an important biomarker for the development of ARDS, and RBG may represent a preventative/therapy in this disorder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25946161>Molecular structure-affinity relationship of bufadienolides and human serum albumin in vitro and molecular docking analysis.</a></h2><p>The development of bufadienolides as anti-tumor agents is limited due to poor pharmacokinetic properties regarding drug half-lives and toxicity in vivo. These serious factors might be improved by increasing the drug/albumin-binding ratio. This study therefore investigated the relationship between the structural properties of nine bufadienolides and their affinities for human serum albumin (HSA) by a fluorescence spectroscopy-based analysis and molecular docking. Fluorescence quenching data showed that the interaction of each  with HSA formed a non-fluorescent complex, while thermodynamic parameters revealed negative ΔS and ΔH values, corresponding to changes in enthalpy and entropy, respectively. The structural differences between the various bufadienolides markedly influenced their binding affinity for HSA. With the exception of a C = O bond at the C12 position that decreased the binding affinity for HSA, other polar groups tended to increase the affinity, especially a hydroxyl (OH) group at assorted  sites. The rank order of binding affinities for drugs with tri-hydroxyl groups was as follows: 11-OH > 5-OH > 16-OH; in addition, 16-acetoxy (OAc), 10-aldehyde and 14-epoxy constituents notably enhanced the binding affinity. Among these groups, 11-OH and 16-acetyl were especially important for a seamless interaction between the bufadienolides and HSA. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis revealed that either an 11-OH or a 16-OAc group spatially close to a five-membered lactone ring significantly facilitated the anchoring of these compounds within site I of the HSA pocket via hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) with Tyr150 or Lys199, respectively. In summary,  structure strongly affects binding with HSA, and 11-OH or 16-OAc groups improve the drug association with key amino acid residues. This information is valuable for the prospective development of bufadienolides with improved pharmacological profiles as novel anti-tumor drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29524286>MALDI-MS argininyl  esters fingerprint from parotoid gland secretions of Rhinella arenarum: Age, gender, and seasonal variation.</a></h2><p>In many amphibians, the granular glands can be grouped in special regions forming macroglands.

Many clinical cases showed that Chan su has severe side-effects on the CNS, causing shortness of breath, breathlessness, seizure, coma and cardiac arrhythmia. We used whole-cell recordings from brain slices to determine the effects of bufadienolides on excitability of a principal neuron in main olfactory bulb (MOB), mitral cells (MCs), and the cellular mechanism underlying the excitation. At higher concentrations, cinobufagin and resibufogenin induced irreversible over-excitation of MCs indicating a toxic effect. At lower concentrations, they concentration-dependently increased spontaneous firing rate, depolarized the membrane potential of MCs, and elicited inward currents. The excitatory effects were due to a direct action on MCs rather than an indirect phasic action. Bufadienolides and ouabain had similar effects on firing of MCs which suggested that bufadienolides activated neuron through a ouabain-like effect, most likely by inhibiting Na+/K+-ATPase. The direct action of  on brain Na+ channels was tested by recordings from stably Nav1.2-transfected cells. Bufadienolides failed to make significant changes of the main properties of Nav1.2 channels in current amplitude, current-voltage (I-V) relationships, activation and inactivation.

Perrier.The methanolic fraction was extracted from the plant roots and contained 0.48 mg bufadienolides/mg of dry mass (11α,19-dihydroksytelocinobufagin, bersaldegenin-1-acetate, bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate, 19-(acetyloxy)-3β,5β,11α,14-tetrahydroxyl-12-oxo-bufa-20,22-dienolide and 19-(acetyloxy)-1β,3β,5β,14-tetrahydroxyl-bufa-20,22-dienolide, mainly). The cytotoxicity of K. daigremontiana fraction was evaluated in an in vitro experimental model of blood platelets. The viability of blood platelets was determined on the basis of a release of lactate dehydrogenase.The fraction scavenged DPPH radicals, with EC of 21.80 μg/mL. Studies on an experimental model of blood plasma under peroxynitrite-induced oxidative stress revealed that the plant preparation had moderate antioxidant properties. Levels of 3-nitrotyrosine and thiol groups indicated that the protective effect of K. daigremontiana was significant mainly for its concentration of 50 μg/mL. No effect was found in prevention of oxidation of low-molecular plasma thiols (glutathione, cysteine and cysteinylglycine). Simultaneously, measurements of lipid hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) indicated that the examined fraction might be effective antioxidant at broader concentration range, that is 1-5 and 25-50 μg/mL for hydroperoxides and TBARS generation, respectively. No cytotoxicity was observed at the concentration range of 1-50 μg/mL.Based on the obtained results, we suggest that antioxidant activity may additionally contribute to beneficial properties of K. daigremontiana-derived extracts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30562827>A -Enriched Fraction of Bryophyllum pinnatum Inhibits Human Myometrial Contractility In Vitro.</a></h2><p> has been used since the 1970s to prevent premature labour, first in anthroposophic hospitals and, more recently, also in the main Swiss perinatal centres. However, it is not known which compounds in  leaves contribute to the tocolytic effect. Here we studied the effects of a flavonoid-enriched fraction, the corresponding flavonoid aglycon mixture, a -enriched fraction, and  leaf press juice on human myometrial contractility . The strength (area under the curve and amplitude) and frequency of contractions were recorded using strips of human myometrium mounted in an organ bath system. Cell viability assays were performed with the human myometrium hTERT-C3 and PHM1 - 41 cell lines. Repeated addition of the flavonoid-enriched fraction, flavonoid aglycon mixture, -enriched fraction, or  leaf press juice led to a progressive decrease of contraction strength, without jeopardising the vitality of myometrium strips. The -enriched fraction was the most active, since 1 µg/mL of the -enriched fraction lowered the area under the curve to 40.1 ± 11.8% of the initial value, whereas 150 µg/mL of the flavonoid-enriched fraction, 6.2 µg/mL of the flavonoid aglycon mixture, and 10 µg/mL of the  leaf press juice were required to achieve comparable inhibition. A progressive increase of contraction frequency was observed, except in the case of the flavonoid aglycon mixture, which did not affect frequency. None of the test substances decreased myometrial cell viability, even at concentrations of 500 µg/mL of the flavonoid-enriched fraction, 40 µg/mL of the flavonoid aglycon mixture, 3.8 µg/mL of the -enriched fraction, and 75 µg/mL of the  leaf press juice, i.e., higher than those used in the myometrium experiments. Given the concentrations of flavonoids in the flavonoid-enriched fraction and  leaf press juice, and of bufadienolides in the -enriched fraction and  leaf press juice, it appears that bufadienolides may be mainly responsible for the relaxant effect.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27616454>Antiproliferative activity and chemical composition of the venom from the Amazonian toad Rhinella marina (Anura: Bufonidae).</a></h2><p>Little is known on the composition of Peruvian Amazon toad venoms.

The main free  was marinobufagin 7 while marinobufotoxin 15 and bufalitoxin 9 were the main  argininyl diacid derivatives. The alkaloids dehydrobufotenin 28 and bufotenidin 29 were present in both venoms. The main difference in the venoms was the relative ratio of argininyl diacids from bufadienolides to free bufadienolides. The argininyl diacids included derivatives from bufalin, marinobufagin, telocinobufagin, hellebrigenin, resibufogenin and bufotalinin. Four compounds, including undecadienoyl aginine 6 and three argininyl diacids from bufadienolides were tentatively identified for the first time in the samples. The venom showed a strong antiproliferative effect towards MRC-5 normal human lung fibroblasts (0.063-0.247 μg/mL), AGS human gastric adenocarcinoma cells (0.076-0.272 μg/mL), SK-MES-1 human lung cancer cells (0.154-0.296 μg/mL), J82 human bladder carcinoma cells (0.169-0.212 μg/mL), and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia (0.071-0.283 μg/mL). The antiproliferative effect is mediated by ROS production and cell cycle arrest in human breast cancer cells (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231). This is the first report on the composition of R. marina venom from the Peruvian Amazon pointing out the need to include different venom samples to get a better picture from the activity and composition of South American toad defense substances.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
