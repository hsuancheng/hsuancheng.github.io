Even if the role of IL-17 in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases has been reported extensively, its role in tumor is still controversial. Some reports show that Th17 cells eradicate tumors, while others reveal that they promote the initiation and early growth of tumors. Herein, we review the role of IL-17 in the involvement of some common dermatologic diseases: , atopic dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, acne, vitiligo, melanoma, and nonmelanoma skin cancers.© 2019 The International Society of Dermatology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661080>Evaluation of Mobile Apps Targeted at Patients With Spondyloarthritis for Disease Monitoring: Systematic App Search.</a></h1><p>There are many apps developed for patients with spondyloarthritis in the market, but their purpose and quality are not objectively evaluated.The objective of this study was to identify and evaluate existing publicly available, high-quality apps that use validated measurement instruments for monitoring spondyloarthritis disease activity.We conducted a review of apps available on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store based on a combination of keywords and inclusion and exclusion criteria. Validated disease activity measurement instruments were identified. Data regarding app characteristics, including the presence of validated disease activity measurement, were extracted. The Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) was used to review the apps for user experience.A total of 1253 apps were identified in the app stores, and 5 apps met the criteria and were further analyzed. Moreover, 2 apps (MySpA and Group for Research and Assessment of  and Psoriatic Arthritis App) contained some of the validated disease activity monitoring instruments for specific spondyloarthritis subtypes. These 2 apps were also rated good on the MARS (with total mean scores ≥4 out of 5), whereas the other apps scored poorly in comparison.There are 2 high-quality spondyloarthritis disease activity monitoring apps publicly available, but they only target 2 spondyloarthritis subtypes-ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. There is a lack of high-quality apps that can measure disease activity for other spondyloarthritis subtypes, and no app that consolidates all validated disease activity instruments across subtypes was available.©Yu Heng Kwan, Wei Jie Ong, Mengfei Xiong, Ying Ying Leung, Jie Kie Phang, Charmaine Tze May Wang, Warren Fong.

Control of the intractable inflammation is a primary goal of HS treatments. Benefit of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies against HS have been reported, and adalimumab has been approved for HS in Europe, the USA and Japan. However, the alternative therapies for anti-TNF antibodies have not been established yet. We experienced a case of HS which developed during the infliximab treatment for Crohn's disease (CD) and was well managed by ustekinumab (UST). We reviewed the articles relating to ustekinumab treatments for HS. Twenty-four HS patients, 16 women and eight men, have been treated with ustekinumab. The average age was 35.7 ± 10.8 years (mean ± SD). All were of Hurley stage II or III. Ten (10/24, 41.6%) had received anti-TNF drugs including infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept prior to UST treatment for HS. Although the initial doses varied from 45 mg s.c. to 390 mg i.v., all cases were treated with 45 or 90 mg s.c. every 8 or 12 weeks at the regular dose, by following the regimen for  or CD. HS in most of the cases started to improve after 3-5 months of UST initiation, and some achieved complete remission. To our knowledge, our case is the first Asian HS patient improved by UST. Overall, UST is useful for HS and could be an alternative treatment if HS patients do not respond to other medications including anti-TNF drugs.© 2019 Japanese Dermatological Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643619>Tildrakizumab.</a></h1><p>Tildrakizumab is humanized monoclonal antibody to interleukin-23 that is used to treat moderate-to-severe plaque .

However, most of the variations are located in non-coding region with high frequency and small effect size. Pathogenetic variants are rarely reported except HLA-C*0602 with the odds ratio being approximately 4.0 in Chinese population. Although rare variations still account for a small proportion of phenotypic variances in complex diseases, their effect on phenotypes is large. Recently, more and more studies focus on the low-frequency functional variants and have achieved a certain amount of success.Whole genome sequencing and sanger sequencing was performed on 8 MZ twin pairs discordant for  to scan and verified the de novo mutations (DNMs). Additionally, 665 individuals with about 20 years' medical history versus 2054 healthy controls and two published large population studies which had about 8 years' medical history (including 10,727 cases versus 10,582 controls) were applied to validate the enrichment of rare damaging mutations in two DNMs genes. Besides, to verify the pathogenicity of candidate DNM in C3, RNA-sequencing for CD4, CD8 T cells of twins and lesion, non-lesion skin of  patients were carried out. Meanwhile, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was used to detect the level of C3, C3b in the supernatant of peripheral blood.A total of 27 DNMs between co-twins were identified. We found six of eight twins carry HLA-C∗0602 allele which have large effects on . And it is interesting that a missense mutation in SPRED1 and a splice region mutation in C3 are found in the  individuals in the other two MZ twin pairs without carrying HLA-C*0602 allele. In the replication stage, we found 2 loss-of-function (LOF) variants of C3 only in 665 cases with about 20 years' medical history and gene-wise analysis in 665 cases and 2054 controls showed that the rare missense mutations in C3 were enriched in cases (OR = 1.91, P = 0.0028). We further scanned the LOF mutations of C3 in two published studies (about 8 years' medical history), and found one LOF mutation in the case without carrying HLA-C*0602. In the individual with DNM in C3, RNA sequencing showed the expression level of C3 in skin was significant higher than healthy samples in public database (TPM fold change = 1.40, P = 0.000181) and ELISA showed protein C3 in peripheral blood was higher (~2.2-fold difference) than the other samples of twins without DNM in C3.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that DNM in C3 is the likely pathological mutations, and it provided a better understanding of the genetic etiology of  and additional treatments for this disease.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Atopic dermatitis predominantly began in childhood with only a very discrete incidence peak in adulthood. Scalp, extremity, chest and abdomen involvement was common to both diseases. Scalp/hairline, elbows, nails, intergluteal cleft, umbilicus, knees and legs were most frequently affected in  patients. In AD, periocular, neck, ante-cubital fossae, back of the hands, interdigital areas, and popliteal fossae were commonly affected.  (but not AD) patients were generally more overweight and obese, physically inactive, and had a positive smoking history compared to general population. Both diseases experienced more frequent flares with increasing disease severity. Patients generally displayed uncontrolled disease despite being on systemic therapies. Itch, skin pain, and troubled sleep were much more severe in AD patients, whereas joint pain was more common in  patients.We identified important similarities and differences in the clinical characteristics of adults with  and AD; these should help clinicians to prioritize and improve patient management.© 2019 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620817>[Treatment of  via lifestyle changes].</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635942>[Lower risk of severe infections in  with certain biologics versus methotrexate].</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616625>Emerging treatment options for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque  and psoriatic arthritis: evaluating bimekizumab and its therapeutic potential [Corrigendum].</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676700>Imaging Techniques: Options for the Diagnosis and Monitoring of Treatment of Enthesitis in Psoriatic Arthritis.</a></h1><p>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) affects up to 30% of patients with  and may include musculoskeletal manifestations such as enthesitis. Enthesitis is associated with joint damage, and early detection and treatment are essential to management of the disease. Traditionally assessed by clinical examination and conventional radiography, entheseal inflammation can now be more accurately assessed earlier in the disease using techniques such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and molecular imaging. However, there is little consensus on the optimum definition for diagnosing enthesitis in PsA or on the ideal scoring system for measuring response to treatment. This review aims to summarize the benefits and limitations of different imaging modalities in the assessment of enthesitis. It also proposes that adoption of standardized definitions and validation of scoring systems and imaging techniques in clinical trials will allow the efficacy of new treatment options to be assessed more accurately.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611943>Possible role of BMP-4 in the hyper-pigmentation of psoriatic plaques after anti-TNF-α treatment.</a></h1><p> over-expresses several inflammatory mediators, which impacts the activity of melanocytes. Tyrosinase (Tyr) and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) are the primary regulators of melanogenesis. Furthermore, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) modulate various pathobiologic processes including inflammation, melanogenesis and melanomagenesis. To determine the association between  and melanogenesis, psoriatic lesional skin was screened through gene expression, immunohistochemistry, immunogold staining and melanin content assays. The present study detected a decreased expression of Tyr, MITF and BMP-4 in psoriatic lesional skin compared with healthy skin. Tyr, BMP-4 and melanin content were also evaluated in the psoriatic lesional skin of patients receiving adalimumab therapy, before and after 16 weeks of treatment. TNF-α blockade modulated the Tyr, BMP-4 and melanin content of the patient skin lesions, which supported the hypothesis that hyper-pigmentation may occur in areas of psoriatic plaque after biological treatment. The present study confirmed the influence of the psoriatic pro-inflammatory network on melanogenesis, exerting an inhibitory effect mediated by TNF-α.

Considerable effort has been put forth to identify proteins that comprise the hair cell mechanotransduction apparatus. TMC1, a member of the transmembrane channel-like (TMC) family, was identified as a core protein of the mechanotransduction complex in hair cells. However, the inability of TMC1 to traffic through the endoplasmic reticulum in heterologous cellular systems has hindered efforts to characterize its function and fully identify its role in mechanotransduction. We developed a novel approach that allowed for the detection of uncharacterized protein regions, which preclude trafficking to the plasma membrane (PM) in heterologous cells. Tagging N-terminal fragments of TMC1 with Aquaporin 3 (AQP3) and GFP fusion reporter, which intrinsically label PM in HEK293 cells, indicated that residues at the edges of amino acid sequence 138-168 invoke intracellular localization and/or degradation. This signal is able to preclude surface localization of PM protein AQP3 in HEK293 cells. Substitutions of the residues by alanine or serine corroborated that the information determining the intracellular retention is present within amino acid sequence 138-168 of TMC1 N-terminus. This novel signal may preclude the proper trafficking of TMC1 to the PM in heterologous cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617856>Decision-Analytic Modeling for Time-Effectiveness of the Sequence of Induction Treatments for Moderate to Severe Plaque .</a></h1><p>Systemic  treatments vary in efficacy and cost but also in time until onset of action. Patients with no response to a first induction treatment are typically switched to another, and some patients require several treatments before they see an improvement.To determine the most cost-effective sequence of induction treatment through a comparative time-effectiveness analysis of different systemic treatment sequences currently licensed in Germany for moderate to severe plaque .This time-effectiveness analysis used a decision-analytic model set in the German health care system. The population simulated to receive the treatment sequences consisted of adult men and women with  vulgaris or plaque type  eligible for systemic treatment. Systematic reviews were performed to generate model input values. Data were collected from November 1 through December 15, 2017, and analyzed from January through August 2018.Five treatment sequences frequently used in Germany, identified through an online expert survey (response rate, 10 of 15 [66.7%]), and 4 theoretical sequences starting with a biological agent. Treatments included methotrexate sodium (MTX), cyclosporine (CSA), fumaric acid esters (FAE), adalimumab (ADA), ixekizumab (IXE), infliximab (INF), and secukinumab (SEC).Two health states were defined: responder (patients achieving a  Area Severity Index [PASI] ≥75) and nonresponder (PASI <75). Probability values were defined as response rates of PASI-75. Treatment effects were determined by the mean change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score. Time until onset of action was assessed as weeks until 25% of patients reach PASI-75. Individual time-effectiveness ratios were calculated per treatment sequence as time until onset of action (in weeks) per minimally important difference (MID) in DLQI and were subsequently ranked.Treatment sequences starting with a biological agent, including IXE-INF-SEC (1.4 weeks per DLQI-MID), INF-IXE-SEC (2.05 weeks per DLQI-MID), SEC-IXE-ADA (2.1 weeks per DLQI-MID), and ADA-IXE-SEC (2.8 weeks per DLQI-MID) were more time-effective than frequently used treatment sequences, including MTX-SEC-ADA (6.8 weeks per DLQI-MID), MTX-ADA-IXE (7.0 weeks per DLQI-MID), MTX-ADA-SEC (7.2 weeks per DLQI-MID), MTX-FAE-ADA (10.05 weeks per DLQI-MID), and FAE-MTX-CSA (11.5 weeks per DLQI-MID). The results were robust to deterministic sensitivity analyses.When allocating monetary resources, policy makers and regulators may want to consider time until patients experience an MID in their quality of life as an additional outcome measure.PROSPERO Identifier: CRD42017074218.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615919>Effect of Secukinumab on the Different GRAPPA-OMERACT Core Domains in Psoriatic Arthritis: A Pooled Analysis of 2049 Patients.</a></h1><p>To compare the efficacy of secukinumab with that of placebo across the updated Group for Research and Assessment of  and Psoriatic Arthritis and Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (GRAPPA-OMERACT) individual PsA core domains using pooled data from 4 phase 3 psoriatic arthritis (PsA) studies and 1 phase 3 ankylosing spondylitis (AS) study.Data were pooled from 2049 patients with PsA participating in 4 on-label phase 3 PsA studies (FUTURE 2-5), and the efficacy of each GRAPPA-OMERACT PsA core domain (musculoskeletal disease activity, skin disease activity, pain, patient global assessment, physical function, health-related quality of life, fatigue, and systemic inflammation) was assessed using multiple measures and definitions specific to each domain.

However, the data regarding the difference in the periodontal health status of the  patients and the nonpsoriasis controls are limited and inconsistent; hence, a specialized meta-analysis that quantitatively compared the periodontal status between the  and nonpsoriasis subjects by evaluating the related clinical periodontal indexes was needed. The aim of this meta-analysis was to quantitatively evaluate whether the periodontal status of  patients is worse than that of nonpsoriasis subjects.  We searched PubMed and EMBASE for all eligible studies that compared the periodontal status between  patients and nonpsoriasis subjects. The studies were screened based on pre-established inclusion criteria. After extracting the available periodontal indexes from the included studies, the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated by pooling the mean and standard deviations (SD) of each index.  In total, 8 studies, including 812  patients and 772 nonpsoriasis subjects, were included in our meta-analysis, and the publication dates ranged from 2013 to 2019; eight periodontal indexes were analyzed.

The drug survival rate for six biologic agents used for the treatment of  was investigated. We reviewed the clinical records of 315 treatment series of 205 patients with moderate to severe  treated with adalimumab (103 cases), infliximab (70 cases), ustekinumab (66 cases), secukinumab (38 cases), brodalumab (12 cases) and ixekizumab (26 cases). In our study, ustekinumab revealed a trend towards higher drug survival among the six biologic agents. Ustekinumab had a higher drug survival rate than infliximab and secukinumab with significant differences by log-rank test among all patients and among biologic-naive (bio-naive) patients. There was no significant difference in drug survival between bio-naive and biologic-experienced (non-naive) patients in the treatment courses with adalimumab, infliximab, ustekinumab, secukinumab and ixekizumab. The dose augmentation therapy in infliximab-treated patients was associated with longer drug survival. Of all patients, 25 cases with generalized pustular  (GPP) were included, who functioned as the negative predictor for drug persistence with a hazard ratio of 1.87 (95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.11; P = 0.016).

To integrate information among multiple studies at the pathway level, pathway-based meta-analysis can be performed. Paired or partially paired samples are common in biomedical research. However, there are currently no existing pathway-based meta-analysis methods appropriate for paired or partially paired study designs. In this study, we developed a pathway-based meta-analysis approach for paired or partially paired samples. Meta-analysis on the transcriptomics profiles were conducted using p-value-based, rank-based, and effect size-based algorithms. The application of our approach was demonstrated using partially paired data from  transcriptomics studies. Upon combining six transcriptomics studies, genes related to the cell cycle and DNA replication pathways are found to be highly perturbed in psoriatic lesional skin samples. Results were validated externally with independent RNA-Seq data. Comparison with existing pathway meta-analysis methods revealed consistent results, with our method showing higher detection power. This study demonstrated the utility of our newly developed pathway-based meta-analysis that allows the incorporation of partially paired or paired samples. The proposed framework can be applied to omics data including but not limited to transcriptomics data.This article is protected by copyright.

Despite restrict cigarette smoking ban in indoor or some outdoor locations, the risk of non-smokers to be exposed to environmental cigarette smoke is not yet eliminated. Beside the well-known effects of cigarette smoke to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, a growing literature has shown during the last 3 decades its noxious effects also on cutaneous tissues. Being the largest organ as well as the interface between the outer environment and the body, human skin acts as a natural shield which is continuously exposed to harmful exogenous agents. Thus, a prolonged and/or repetitive exposure to significant levels of toxic smoke pollutants may have detrimental effects on the cutaneous tissue by disrupting the epidermal barrier function and by exacerbating inflammatory skin disorders (i.e. , atopic dermatitis). With the development of very complex skin tissue models and sophisticated cigarette smoke exposure systems it has become important to better understand the toxicity pathways induced by smoke pollutants in more realistic laboratory conditions to find solutions for counteracting their effects. This review provides an update on the skin models currently available to study cigarette smoke exposure and the known pathways involved in cutaneous toxicity. In addition, the article will briefly cover the inflammatory skin pathologies potentially induced and/or exacerbated by cigarette smoke exposure.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Patients susceptible to hepatotoxicity on exposure to dapsone is constantly on the rise. Dapsone (4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone) is clinically used alone or in combination with rifampicin for the treatment of a variety of dermatological disorders such as acne, dermatitis herpetiformis, ,  infections, leprosy and  pneumonia in AIDS patients. However, the clinical use of dapsone is limited because of dose-dependent adverse hematological reactions. The cholestatic injury caused by dapsone and its - hydroxylated metabolites hinders bile flow and causes oxidative stress and hepatic necrosis, further, leading to hemolysis responsible for hepatitis due to iron overload in the liver. Hence, clinicians' awareness of the hepatotoxic potential of dapsone is highly warranted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644159>Tumor Necrosis Factor Antagonists.</a></h1><p>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha is a bioactive cytokine that is an important component of the inflammatory and pain pathways. Inhibition of TNF can decrease the inflammatory response, and this approach has been used in therapy of autoimmune conditions, most effectively in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (also known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis), , psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Five anti-TNF antagonists have been developed and introduced into clinical medicine: a mouse-human chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF (infliximab), two human monoclonal antibodies to TNF (adalimumab and golimumab), a humanized Fab fragment of anti-TNF linked to polyethylene glycol (certolizumab), and a soluble recombinant form of the TNF cellular receptor (etanercept) which, on binding, blocks the activity of TNF. These TNF antagonists have potent activity in several autoimmune diseases marked by excessive production of this proinflammatory cytokine. All five of these agents are approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis and are considered “disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs” (DMARDs), having been shown to decrease pain, improve function, and ameliorate progressive joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis. The monoclonal antibodies to TNF have also been shown to be effective in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and inflammatory bowel disease. The five agents rarely cause serum aminotransferase elevations, but have been linked to rare instances of clinically apparent, acute liver injury which often resembles autoimmune hepatitis and can be severe or require corticosteroid therapy. TNF antagonists are also immunosuppressive and can lead to reactivation of latent infections such as tuberculosis and hepatitis B. Severe and even fatal instances of reactivation of hepatitis B have been linked to several anti-TNF agents, and routine screening for HBsAg before starting therapy with these agents is recommended. Patients with HBsAg should receive prophylaxis with an oral antiviral agent during therapy with one of the TNF antagonists. Among the TNF antagonists, infliximab has been most frequently and etanercept least frequently linked to liver injury, including asymptomatic serum aminotransferase elevations, induction of clinically apparent autoimmune hepatitis, and reactivation of hepatitis B. However, infliximab has been most extensively used and studied than the other anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies, and liver injury due to these agents is probably class specific. For these reasons, all five of these agents should be considered potentially hepatotoxic, etanercept perhaps less so that the others.

Exposure was dispensation for IL-17 (ixekizumab or secukinumab), IL-12/23 (ustekinumab) or TNF (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab and infliximab). The outcome was infection requiring hospitalisation after biologic initiation. Incidence rates (IRs) per 100 person-years were computed, and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for inverse probability of treatment-weighted propensity scores.A total of 11 560 new treatment episodes were included. Overall, 190 serious infections (2% of treatment episodes) were identified in 9264 person-years of follow-up. Class-specific IRs were similar among IL-17 and TNF, yet significantly lower for IL-12/23. After adjustment for propensity scores, there was no increased risk with IL-17 compared with either TNF (HR=0.89, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.66) or IL-12/23 (HR=1.12, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.03). By contrast, IL-23/23 were associated with a lower risk of infections than TNF (HR=0.59, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.90).Relative to TNF and IL-17, IL-12/23 inhibitors were associated with a reduced risk of serious infection in biologic-naïve patients with PsO or PsA.

To align the way people interact with each other using messaging platforms with the chatbot architecture, we propose these very same channels for the chatbot-patient interaction, paying special attention to security and privacy issues. Finally, we present a monitored-data study performed in different chronic diseases, and we present a prototype implementation tailored for one specific chronic disease, , showing how this new architecture allows the change, the addition or the improvement of different parts of the chatbot in a dynamic and flexible way, providing a substantial improvement in the development of chatbots used as virtual assistants for chronic patients.Copyright © 2019.

Myocardial infarction or stroke can also be a result of underlying haemostasis disorders. Disorders in fibrinolysis and thrombosis in patients with  have been observed by many authors.This study points to the key role played by the tissue factor (TF) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) in the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation and the potential influence of microvascular disorders in inflamed psoriatic skin on TF and TFPI activity.The study included 47 patients with active  vulgaris, hospitalized in the Dermatological Ward of the Regional Specialist Hospital, Research and Development Centre in Wroclaw, as well as 18 people from the control group.There were significant differences in the blood concentrations of TF and TFPI in patients with  when compared to the control group. A low TFPI concentration in psoriatic patients may indicate an increased risk of atherosclerosis. Interpretation of a decreased level of TF in patients with  is difficult because it seems to be at odds with observations among patients with other atherosclerosis risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes or smoking.It appears that further studies are necessary to explain this problem, perhaps to include an evaluation of TF levels in psoriatic skin.Copyright: © 2019 Termedia Sp. z o. o.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638325>Blaschkoid : An unusual variant of  that needs to be diagnosed early and treated aggressively.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696747>Association between infliximab concentrations and clinical response in : a prospective cohort study.</a></h1><p> Infliximab (IFX) trough concentrations (C) have been linked to treatment efficacy in psoriatic patients.

In this study, we applied smoothing methods to estimate coefficients in time-dependent rate model, and we also showed its application in data of  patients.  In the present study,  patients who experienced relapse that led to hospitalization during 2005 and 2014 in the Dermatology Department of Imam Khomeini hospital in Tehran were examined. To investigate the rate of relapse during a year, time-dependent rate model was used and variability of the effects was assessed using Wald test. Both b-spline and kernel methods were used to estimate time varying coefficients in rates model. Finally, results from methods were compared based on the obtained estimates.  Based on the results of the Wald test, the effect of season on the occurrence of  was significantly different (p<0.01). Also according to the estimated coefficients from both b-spline and kernel methods, there was little difference between them.  In situations in which the effect of a variable is different at different times, using time-dependent coefficients rate model can lead to a better estimate of the effect of variable on the response. On the other hand, smoothing methods can smooth the effects of the variables that vary over time.© 2019 Iran University of Medical Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625919>Low serum testosterone levels in male  patients correlate with disease severity.</a></h1><p> is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with a genetic and autoimmune background.

Recently, it has been found that oral microbiota are involved in arthritis pathogenesis. Microbiome composition and its functional implications have been associated with the prevention of bone loss and/or reducing fracture risk. The link between gut-oral microbiota and joint inflammation in animal models of arthritis has been established, and it is now receiving increasing attention in human studies. Recent papers have demonstrated substantial alterations in the gut and oral microbiota in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). These alterations resemble those established in systemic inflammatory conditions (inflammatory bowel disease, spondyloarthritides, and ), which include decreased microbial diversity and a disturbance of immunoregulatory properties.

Treatment of the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated THP-1 cells with SBKT subdued the enhanced release of intracellular reactive nitrogen species and expression of NF-κB protein, in a concentration-dependent manner. This was accompanied by a reduction in the release of downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines: Interleukin-1ß and interleukin-6. Tumor necrosis factor-α released in the stimulated THP-1 cells were also inhibited by SBKT dose of 5 µl/ml.  oral and topical treatment with SBKT in the Carrageenan-stimulated paw edema model, showed a significant decrease in paw volume and edema. In the 12-O tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) stimulated CD-1 mice -like model, concurrent oral and tropical SBKT treatments substantially reduced ear edema and ear biopsy weights. Histopathologically, significant reduction in ear epidermal thickness and skin lesion scores was observed in the SBKT-treated animals. In conclusion, SBKT showed anti-inflammatory and anti--like efficacies in healing chemical-induced inflammation and . The possible mode of action of SBKT was found through inhibition of reactive nitrogen species, and downregulation of NF-κB protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, the present data suggest that Sea buckthorn oil can be used as an anti-inflammatory and anti-psoriatic nutraceutical.Copyright © 2019 Balkrishna, Sakat, Joshi, Joshi, Sharma, Ranjan, Bhattacharya and Varshney.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665730>Tofacitinib in Pediatric : An Open-Label Trial to Study Its Safety and Efficacy in Children.</a></h1><p> is a chronic, multifactorial, inflammatory disorder, with an estimated prevalence of 0.71% in children.

SERPINB2 has been shown to be upregulated in the inflammation and infections. Here we aimed to study the relationship between miR-146a/b and SERPINB2 and to delineate the role of SERPINB2 in association of plaque . We report increased SERPINB2 expression in the skin of  patients, which was in a positive relationship with  severity and in a negative relationship with miR-146a/b in psoriatic lesions. In cultured keratinocytes, both cellular and secreted SERPINB2 levels were strongly induced in response to IFN-γ and TNF-α. Interestingly, SERPINB2 mRNA was down-regulated by IL-17A and the combination of TNF-α and IL-17A at timepoints when miR-146a was increased. The predicted binding site for miR-146a/b in 3' untranslated region of SERPINB2 revealed no activity in luciferase assay, while siRNA silencing of miR-146a/b direct targets IRAK1 and CARD10 resulted in reduced expression of SERPINB2, suggesting that miR-146a/b indirectly control SERPINB2 expression in the skin. The siRNA silencing of SERPINB2 increased the expression of IL-8, CXCL5 and CCL5 and migration of neutrophils revealing its anti-inflammatory role in keratinocytes.

Cytokines secreted by infiltrated inflammatory cells contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. TIPE2, one of the four family members of Tumor necrosis factor-α induced protein-8 (TNFAIP8), is a negative regulator of innate and adaptive immunity and plays essential roles in the maintenance of immune tolerance. However, studies on the role of TIPE2 during the development of autoimmune diseases have generated contradictory results. In the current study, we sought to determine the role of TIPE2 during the development of IMQ-induced  and Experimental Autoimmune Uveitis (EAU) in mice. Our study revealed that, while TIPE2-deficiency alleviates , it exacerbates the development of EAU. Further studies demonstrated that, although TIPE2-deficient T cells produced more IL-17A, they do not migrate efficiently to the local inflammatory site, i.e., the skin. This in turn led to the decreased IL-17A production in the skin and consequently reduced the severity of  in TIPE2-deficient mice. However, although TIPE2-deficient T cells still produced more IL-17A in EAU model, they migrate into the inflamed eye as efficient as TIPE2-sufficient T cells, and consequently exacerbates the development of EAU in TIPE2-deficient mice. Taken together, these results indicate that TIPE2 may either promote or suppress autoimmunity depending on the specific inflammatory microenvironment in different types of autoimmune diseases.Copyright © 2019 Liu, He, Geng, Wang and Ruan.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669719>Geraniol targets K1.3 ion channel and exhibits anti-inflammatory activity in vitro and in vivo.</a></h1><p>Naturally occurring monoterpenes are known for their various pharmacological activities including anti-inflammation. K1.3 ion channel is a voltage-gated potassium channel and has been validated as a drug target for autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases like . Here we experimentally test the direct interaction between monoterpenes and K1.3 ion channel. Our electrophysiological analysis determined that monoterpenes (geraniol, nerol, β-citronellol, citral and linalool) have inhibitory effects on K1.3 ion channel. Representatively, geraniol reversibly blocked K1.3 currents in a voltage-dependent manner with an IC of 490.50 ± 1.04 μM at +40 mV in HEK293T cells. At the effective concentrations, geraniol also inhibited cytokine secretion of activated human T cells, including IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-γ. In an imiquimod-induced -like animal model, geraniol administration significantly reduced  area and severity index scores, ameliorated the deteriorating histopathology and decreased the degree of splenomegaly. Together, our findings not only suggest that monoterpenes may serve as lead molecules for the development of K1.3 inhibitors, but also indicate that geraniol could be considered as a promising therapeutic candidate to treat autoimmune diseases.Copyright © 2018.

As hypoxia in the epidermis is important for maintaining skin homeostasis, we examined the regulation of TSLP expression by hypoxic conditions in normal skin epithelial tissues. TNF-α-induced expression of TSLP in human keratinocyte HaCaT and in mouse keratinocyte PAM212 cell lines were inhibited under hypoxic condition (1% O2), although the mRNA expressions of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and VEGF-A were not inhibited. Hypoxia-mimicking conditions, which include NiCl2, CoCl2, and DMOG, an inhibitor of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzymes, also selectively inhibited TNF-α-induced TSLP expression. These results suggested that inactivation of prolyl hydroxylase by hypoxia and hypoxia-mimicking conditions is involved in the repression of TNF-α-induced TSLP expression. Interestingly, the inhibition of TSLP production by hypoxic treatment was significantly reversed by treatment with the HIF-2α antagonist but not with the HIF-1α inhibitor. DMOG-induced inhibition of TSLP promoter activity was dependent on the -71 to +185 bp promoter region, suggesting that the binding of HIF-2 to hypoxia response element (HRE) in this region repressed the TSLP expression. These results indicated that hypoxia and hypoxia-mimicking conditions inhibited TSLP expression via HIF-2 and HRE-dependent mechanisms.

Skin biopsies and blood samples were collected on day 0, 4, 14, 42 and 84; and processed for microarray gene expression analysis. Furthermore, in vitro experiments with human keratinocytes and synovial fibroblasts were conducted.Secukinumab improved clinical scores and histological  features. Moreover, secukinumab altered the skin transcriptome. The major transcriptional shift appeared between day 14 and day 42 after treatment initiation, though already at day four, 80 genes were differentially expressed. NFKBIZ (the gene encoding IκBζ) was reduced already after four days of treatment in the skin. NFKBIZ expression correlated to PASI, and NFKBIZ mRNA levels in the skin decreased during anti-IL-17A treatment. Moreover, specific NFKBIZ signature genes were significantly altered during anti-IL-17A treatment. Finally, we identified Act1, p38 MAPK, JNK, and NF-κB as key signaling pathways in NFKBIZ/IκBζ regulation.Our results define a crucial role for IκBζ in the anti-psoriatic effect of secukinumab. Because IκBζ signature genes were regulated already after four days of treatment, this strongly indicates that IκBζ plays a crucial role for the anti-psoriatic effects mediated by anti-IL-17A treatment.Copyright © 2019.

The similarities lead to dataset-to-dataset networks visualizing the landscape of a large portion of biological data.

TNF inhibitors still represent the first biologic after conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) in the majority of patients according to registry data. This was possibly because they were historically the first biological agents available (biological DMARDS with a different mechanism of action or targeted synthetic DMARDs did not become available until 2006s), and so switching from one to another was frequent in the case of an inadequate response and/or side effects. TNF inhibitors are also efficacious for other inflammatory joint and spine diseases, and have been approved for inflammatory bowel disease, uveitis and . In addition, national registries have provided long-term safety data and demonstrated their beneficial effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, approximately 30-40% of patients discontinue anti-TNF treatment because of primary failure, secondary loss of response, or intolerance. The options for managing anti-TNF treatment failures include switching to an alternative anti-TNF (cycling) or to another class of targeted drug with a different mechanism of action (swapping). The aim of this review is to evaluate the pros and cons of whether it is more appropriate to choose a second anti-TNF biological agents after the failure of the first or swap treatment early.Copyright © 2019.

We have previously demonstrated the role of obese adipose-derived stem cells (ob-ASC) and adipocytes (AD) in the mediation of inflammation through promotion of Th17 cells and activation of monocytes. Such an inflammation resulted in impaired ob-ASC adipogenesis and AD insulin response. In the present study, we investigated the role of IL-17A in the impairment of these functions.With this aim, we used Secukinumab, a potent human anti-IL17A monoclonal antibody which has been approved for the treatment of some IL-17A related inflammatory diseases, notably . This antibody was added or not to phytohemagglutinin A-activated co-cultures of ob-ASC and mononuclear cells. The conditioning media of those co-cultures were harvested and added to AD ongoing differentiation from ob-ASC. Adipogenesis, insulin sensitivity and secretion of inflammatory cytokines were then measured using qRT-PCR, Western blots and ELISAs, respectively.Surprisingly, we did not observe any direct effect of IL-17A on ob-ASC adipogenesis, despite sensitivity of ob-ASC to IL-17A. Moreover, IL-17A blockade, with the help of Secukinumab, did not lead to the recovery of adipogenesis and insulin response, when these functions were impaired by the presence of an inflammatory conditioning medium. However, the up-regulation of IL6 and IL1B mRNA expression by AD submitted to inflammatory conditioning medium was inhibited in the presence of Secukinumab, which indicates that IL-17A may play a role in the propagation of inflammation towards AD.we show herein that IL-17A does not play a major role in the impairment of adipogenesis and/or insulin resistance mediated by an inflammatory environment, but contributes to the propagation of inflammation in human obese adipose tissues. This suggests a beneficial effect of anti-IL17A mAb in inflammatory pathologies, where obesity contributes to poorer response to biologic treatments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional systemic drugs and biologic agents are used for the treatment of moderate to severe PsO and recent research emphasizes understanding patient goals and preferences for treatment, to improve overall outcomes.An online survey was administered to collect data from 500 adult patients with moderate to severe PsO in the USA. Patients were required to have current or previous systemic therapy use and were excluded if aged 75 or older. Data on demographics, disease burden, treatment use, and patients' treatment goals and expectations were collected. Descriptive and multivariate analyses examined the factors that predict treatment goals. Subgroup analyses were performed for age, gender, severity, comorbid psoriatic arthritis (PsA), location of PsO, and biologic experience. All analyses were conducted using SAS v9.4 and R v3.4.Of the 500 adult patients included, 71.6% reported moderate PsO. Patients had a mean (SD) score of 62.4 (23.0) for skin pain, 60.0 (26.3) for fatigue, and 6.6 (2.1) for itch on a scale of 0-100, 0-100, and 0-10 respectively. Mean (SD) score for quality of life (QoL), assessed using Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), was 18.3 (7.3), with more than 90% having moderate/very large/extremely large effect on life.

By inducing glycosuria, SGLT2i predispose to genital infections. In addition, rare occurrence of Fournier's gangrene (FG) has been reported. We aimed to investigate such association through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event (AE) reporting system (FAERS).We mined the FAERS up to 2018q3 (before FDA warning about SGLT2i-associated FG) to retrieve reports including FG as an AE and SGLT2i as suspect or concomitant drugs, and calculated proportional reporting ratios (PRR).We retrieved 47 cases of FG and 17 cases of other severe AEs of the genital area associated with SGLT2i. Patients with FG were ~10 years older than those with other severe genital AEs. Overall, 77% occurred in men. Three patients were concomitantly treated with systemic immunosuppressive drugs. Increased reporting frequency emerged for SGLT2i compared with other drugs, with a PRR ranging from 5 to 10. The disproportional reporting of FG with SGLT2i remained robust and consistently significant when restricting to the period when SGLT2i were available, to reports filed for glucose-lowering medications or for drugs with the diabetes indication, and after refining the definition of FG. FG was disproportionally associated with  and with the combination of immunosuppressants and SGLT2i.Although causality cannot be demonstrated, SGLT2i may predispose to FG and other severe genital AEs. Since the use of SGLT2i is expected to increase significantly, clinicians should be aware of these severe, although rare, AEs and their predisposing factors.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Among the various drugs used to treat , tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors seemed to increase the incidence of demyelinating diseases while IL-17A inhibitors seemed to reduce the activity of multiple sclerosis.The aim of this study is to find out if the use of Secukinumab in patients with  and multiple sclerosis would be both beneficial and safe.A 45-years-old woman affected by  and psoriatic arthritis was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis during the treatment for . She performed follow-up visits at the Dermo-Rheuma Center of Spedali Civili Hospital in Brescia and, after several different therapies, was finally treated with Secukinumab. Outpatient follow-up visits were performed every two months valuating PASI, joint involvement with CASPAR and DAPSA score and the neurological state with a clinical evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging.A significant improvement of both  and psoriatic arthritis was observed with Secukinumab 300 mg administered monthly. PASI 75 was reached at 4 weeks of therapy, PASI 90 at 6 weeks and PASI 100 at 12 weeks. At 24 months of treatment PASI 100 was still maintained, no neurological symptoms were reported and multiple sclerosis remained stable over time.The blockade of IL-17A with Secukinumab could be a safe and very promising therapeutic option for patients with  and multiple sclerosis.© 2019 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622280>Keratinocyte-derived IκBζ drives  and associated systemic inflammation.</a></h1><p>The transcriptional activator IκBζ is a key regulator of , but which cells mediate its pathogenic effect remains unknown. Here we found that IκBζ expression in keratinocytes triggers not only skin lesions, but also systemic inflammation in mouse  models. Specific depletion of IκBζ in keratinocytes was sufficient to suppress the induction of imiquimod- or IL-36-mediated . Moreover, IκBζ ablation in keratinocytes prevented the onset of psoriatic lesions and systemic inflammation in keratinocyte-specific IL-17A transgenic mice. Mechanistically, this  protection was mediated by the fact that IκBζ deficiency in keratinocytes abrogated the induction of specific pro-inflammatory target genes, including Cxcl5, Cxcl2, Csf2 and Csf3, in response to IL-17A or IL-36. These IκBζ-dependent genes trigger the generation and recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes that are needed for skin inflammation. Consequently, our data uncover a surprisingly pivotal role of keratinocytes and keratinocyte-derived IκBζ as key mediators of  and -related systemic inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634384>The impact of diet on .</a></h1><p>Because  is a chronic and inflammatory disease, many patients seek alternative therapies and lifestyle modifications to supplement their treatments and help relieve symptoms. Both the disease and the modifications are multifactorial, making it difficult to quantify the effectiveness of a single change. A review of the available literature reveals that most diets have mixed impacts on , though some individual foods have seen more prominence in studies. Foods and supplements with systemic anti-inflammatory effects seem to have a higher chance of improving  symptoms. Overall, additional large-population studies with a higher statistical power are needed to review these studies. We suggest web-based national cohort surveys as a possible method to quickly gather a large amount of data for future studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611879>The Pathogenic Role of Dysregulated Epigenetic Modifications in Autoimmune Diseases.</a></h1><p>Autoimmune diseases can be chronic with relapse of inflammatory symptoms, but it can be also acute and life-threatening if immune cells destroy life-supporting organs, such as lupus nephritis. The etiopathogenesis of autoimmune diseases has been revealed as that genetics and environmental factors-mediated dysregulated immune responses contribute to the initiation and development of autoimmune disorders. However, the current understanding of pathogenesis is limited and the underlying mechanism has not been well defined, which lows the development of novel biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies for autoimmune diseases. To improve this, broadening and deepening our understanding of pathogenesis is an unmet need. As genetic susceptibility cannot explain the low accordance rate of incidence in homozygous twins, epigenetic regulations might be an additional explanation. Therefore, this review will summarize current progress of studies on epigenetic dysregulations contributing to autoimmune diseases, including SLE, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), , type 1 diabetes (T1D), and systemic sclerosis (SSc), hopefully providing opinions on orientation of future research, as well as discussing the clinical utilization of potential biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for these diseases.Copyright © 2019 Wu, Chen, Zhu, Zhao and Lu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673756>Resolution of plaque-type : what is left behind (and reinitiates the disease).</a></h1><p> is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that involves numerous types of immune cells and cytokines resulting in an inflammatory feedback loop and hyperproliferation of the epidermis. A more detailed understanding of the underlying pathophysiology has revolutionized anti-psoriatic treatment and led to the development of various new drugs targeting key inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17A and IL-23. Successfully treated psoriatic lesions often resolve completely, leaving nothing visible to the naked eye. However, such lesions tend to recur within months at the exact same body sites.

This analysis evaluated the consistency of response in the Asian subpopulation in VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2. Study designs were identical through week 24; patients were randomized to guselkumab, placebo, or adalimumab. Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA),  Area and Severity Index (PASI), safety, and pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity data from VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 were pooled and compared by race (Asian, n = 199; non-Asian, n = 1630). At week 16, treatment differences between guselkumab and placebo were 78.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 66.9-89.6) and 76.4 (95% CI, 72.7-80.2) percentage points for IGA 0/1 (score of 0 or 1) and 70.1 (95% CI, 60.0-80.1) and 68.5 (95% CI, 64.9-72.2) percentage points for PASI 90 (≥90% improvement) in the Asian and non-Asian populations, respectively. Treatment differences between guselkumab and adalimumab were 31.1 (95% CI, 17.7-44.6) and 16.1 (95% CI, 11.2-21.0) percentage points for IGA 0/1 and 24.9 (95% CI, 9.4-40.5) and 23.2 (95% CI, 17.7-28.6) percentage points for PASI 90 in the Asian and non-Asian populations, respectively. Similar results were observed at week 24. Safety was generally similar between populations and among treatment groups. Median serum guselkumab concentrations over time were comparable between the populations. Comparable responses between the Asian and non-Asian populations in this analysis suggest that the overall efficacy, safety, and the resulting benefit/risk analyses from VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 are applicable to Asian populations.© 2019 Janssen Research & Development, LLC.

The link between psoriatic condition and obesity is based on shared pathophysiological pathways where local and systemic inflammation promote each other; PsO is an inflammatory, immune-mediated disease, and the adipose tissue is the source of proinflammatory adipokines. Moreover, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an important comorbidity of PsO that reduces quality of life and makes difficult the patient's management. Treatment of obese subjects with moderate to severe PsO, even more if PsA is present, is challenging because of reduced efficacy of several systemic drugs and increased risk of adverse events. Secukinumab, a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and neutralizes interleukin 17A, shows efficacy on PsO in all body weight groups, even in the highest, whose response has a slight downward trend. Clinical features of two obese subjects, affected by PsO and PsA, successfully treated with secukinumab, are described.Copyright © 2019 by S.

CRMO is a diagnosis of exclusion, resulting in often-delayed diagnosis with over one year on average from onset of symptoms to time of diagnosis. Initial diagnosis is rare in adults and previously undocumented in the elderly (age greater than 65). We highlight a case of a 74-year-old elderly Caucasian female with a history of palmoplantar pustular  who presented with pelvic and hip pain. Imaging findings included multiple bony lesions on x-rays, increased uptake in the left side of the pelvis, ileum, proximal sternum, and bilateral medial clavicles on nuclear bone scan. Bone biopsy histologic results of marrow fibrosis and plasma cell infiltrate indicative of chronic inflammation lead to the diagnosis of CRMO. This case highlights that while CRMO is typically a disease with childhood onset, it, while rare, can also present in adults and now has presented in the elderly, remaining an important part of the differential diagnosis of bone pain in adults and the elderly in addition to infectious osteomyelitis and malignancy when imaging reveals multiple bony lesions.

Retinoids have multiple actions and play important roles in regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, vision, bone growth, tumor suppression and immunity. The effects of retinoids are thought to be mediated by their binding to and activation of the retinoic acid and retinoid X receptors which regulate gene expression, important in normal growth and differentiation. Vitamin A in doses that have medical effects was found to be toxic, particularly when given long term. Modification of the vitamin A structure led to retinoid molecules that had many of its beneficial, but fewer of its adverse effects. Oral retinoids in use in the United States include acitretin for  and isotretinoin for severe nodular acne. Tretinoin is used topically and several other retinoids have been developed for therapy of uncommon forms of cancer (alitretinoin, bexarotene). The commonly used retinoids have many of the side effects of vitamin A including dry skin, cheilosis and nosebleeds and hair loss, but are not stored in the liver and do not cause the typical form of chronic liver disease associated with excessive vitamin A intake. Both acitretin and isotretinoin are teratogenic and embryotoxic and are contraindicated in women who are or intend to become pregnant. Retinoids have been implicated in causing mild-to-moderate elevations in routine liver tests, but these elevations are usually asymptomatic and transient, resolving spontaneously even with continued therapy. Marked elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during retinoid therapy are uncommon, and dose adjustment or drug discontinuation are rarely required for liver test abnormalities. Nevertheless, laboratory monitoring is recommended with routine liver tests at baseline and one month later, and testing thereafter only if abnormalities were found or symptoms arise. Several retinoids (acitretin, etretinate, retinal acetate) have been associated with a clinically apparent acute liver injury which typically arises during the first 3 months of therapy, has many features of hypersensitivity and can be severe and even fatal. Interestingly, isotretinoin often causes mild serum aminotransferase elevations and is commonly listed as having frequent adverse effects on the liver, but it has not been convincingly linked to instances of severe clinically apparent, acute liver injury with jaundice. Two retinoids used in dermatology, acitretin and isotretinoin, are discussed in this record and their combined references of retinoids are provided at the end of this introductory section.

This reaction is typically associated with an intense itch at the reaction site. Upon activation, cutaneous mast cells release powerful mediators, such as histamine, tryptase, cytokines, and growth factors that can directly stimulate corresponding receptors on itch-mediating sensory nerves. These include, e.g., H1- and H4-receptors, protease-activated receptor-2, IL-31 receptor, and the high-affinity receptor of nerve growth factor (TrkA). On the other hand, sensory nerves can release neuropeptides, including substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide, that are able to stimulate mast cells to release mediators leading to potentiation of the reciprocal interaction, inflammation, and itch. Even though mast cells are well recognized for their role in allergic skin whealing and urticaria, increasing evidence supports the reciprocal function between mast cells and sensory nerves in neurogenic inflammation in chronic skin diseases, such as  and atopic dermatitis, which are often characterized by distressing itch, and exacerbated by psychological stress. Increased morphological contacts between mast cells and sensory nerves in the lesional skin in  and atopic dermatitis as well as experimental models in mice and rats support the essential role for mast cell-sensory nerve communication in consequent pruritus. Therefore, we summarize here the present literature pointing to a close association between mast cells and sensory nerves in pruritic skin diseases as well as review the essential supporting findings on pruritic models in mice and rats.Copyright © 2019 Siiskonen and Harvima.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631555>Dermatological complications of therapy with biologics in inflammatory autoimmune diseases.</a></h1><p>Cutaneous adverse events (CAEs) occur in up to 10 % of patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID) treated with antitumor necrosis factor (TNF)α agents.

Respondents routinely asked about IBD (91%),  (81%), acute anterior uveitis (49%), peripheral arthritis (71%), genitourinary/gut infection (56%), enthesitis (30%) and dactylitis (20%). Eighty-seven per cent were aware of the association between axSpA and HLA-B27. Only 29% recognized that axSpA was common in women. Forty per cent recommend an X-ray (pelvic in 80%) and, if normal, 27% would recommend MRI of the sacroiliac joints and whole spine. Forty-four per cent were aware of biologic therapies. Forty-three per cent were confident with the process of onward referral to rheumatology via the general practitioner (GP). The principal perceived barrier to onward referral was reluctance by the GP to accept their professional opinion.Overall knowledge of ankylosing spondylitis is good, but the term axSpA is poorly understood. Specific learning needs include gender preponderance, awareness of acute anterior uveitis and the availability of biological therapies.

Criterion validity of presence of EAMs, osteoporosis and fractures was assessed as agreement (kappa) between patients' self-reported and physician-confirmed disease. Construct validity of the mSCQ including EAMs, osteoporosis and/or fractures (SpA-SCQ) was assessed by testing hypotheses about correlations with demographics, physical function, work ability, health utility and disease activity, and was compared with construct validity of the rheumatic disease comorbidity index.In total, 3984 patients contributed to the analyses. Agreement between patient-reported and physician-reported EAMs was substantial to almost perfect (uveitis ĸ = 0.81, IBD ĸ = 0.73,  ĸ = 0.86).

Correlations with the different constructs were stronger for the both mSCQ and SpA-SCQ (rBASFI = 0.34; rEQ-5D = -0.33) compared with the rheumatic disease comorbidity index (rBASFI = 0.24; rEQ-5D = -0.21).The mSCQ is a valid self-report instrument to assess the influence of comorbidities on health outcomes in patients with SpA. Adding EAMs and/or osteoporosis or fractures does not improve validity of the mSCQ.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Rheumatology.

Epigenetic modifications include DNA methylation, histone modification, and gene silencing via the action of microRNAs. Epigenetic dysregulation has been implicated in many disease processes. In the field of dermatology, epigenetic regulation has been extensively explored as a pathologic mechanism in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), which has led to the successful development of epigenetic therapies for CTCL. In recent years, the potential role of epigenetic regulation in the pathogeneses of inflammatory skin diseases has gained greater appreciation. In particular, epigenetic changes in  and atopic dermatitis have been increasingly studied, with DNA methylation the most rigorously investigated to date. In this review, we provide an overview of DNA methylation in inflammatory skin diseases with an emphasis on  and atopic dermatitis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692558>Effect of narrowband ultraviolet B therapy on serum levels of CD26/dipeptidyl-peptidase IV and truncated forms of substance P in  patients with pruritus.</a></h1><p>While pruritus affects approximately 60-90% of  patients, the pathogenesis of the condition remains unclear. CD26/dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (CD26/DPPIV) and truncated forms of substance P (SP) have been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriatic itch. The aim of this study was to determine the serum levels of soluble CD26/DPPIV and truncated forms of SP in response to narrowband ultraviolet B (NBUVB) therapy.The peripheral blood of 13 participants with moderate to severe  ( area and severity index (PASI) ≥10) who presented with pruritus symptoms and 12 -free participants were collected. Seven of the 13 patients agreed to be treated with NBUVB. The PASI was evaluated. Additionally, the clinical assessment of itch was performed with the visual analog scale (VAS) and the itch severity scale (ISS).The results showed that the levels of truncated SP were significantly higher in participants with  compared to participants without . (302.20±56.87 vs 234.96±78.01 pg/ml, <0.05). After irradiation, truncated SP significantly decreased from 288.85±66.22 pg/ml to 252.13±49.78 pg/ml, <0.05. The CD26/DPPIV levels were lower in  participants compared to the healthy participants (526.34±145.35 vs 593.19±84.92 ng/ml, >0.05) and increased significantly after NBUVB therapy (518.13±173.0 ng/ml to 592.7±193.9 ng/ml, <0.05). NBUVB therapy caused alterations to the serum levels of truncated SP and CD26/DPPIV.The decreased serum levels of truncated SP and increased levels of CD26/DPPIV post-NBUVB treatment observed in this study provides insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of the treatment; this may be used in the prospective monitoring and development of improved -related pruritus therapeutics. Further studies, comprising a larger cohort, are required to confirm these results.© 2019 Kongthong et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639095>Application of medicinal plants in several dermatovenerological entities.</a></h1><p>Treatment of skin conditions with medicinal plants has been an ongoing human activity lasting over thousands of years.

Pinitol, conservatively used in ayurvedic medicine, has been shown to disclose an antiinflammatory effect, hold back the T-helper cells, and postpone cardiovascular diseases. In the present study we aimed to reveal the effect of D-pinitol on imiquimod (IMQ)-induced -like skin inflammation in a mouse model via the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway genes. In the current study, we found that D-pinitol ameliorated the skin abrasion and abridged epithelial thickness, inflammation numbers, and collagen-occupied regions in IMQ-induced -like mice. The same results (epithelial thickness, inflammation numbers, and collagen-occupied regions) we achieved in dorsal skin regions. In addition, D-pinitol modified the lipid profile and antioxidant enzyme levels, which means that the IMQ-induced group showed elevated malondialdehyde when compared to D-pinitol. Downregulated expression of glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase in the IMQ-induced group was incomparable with D-pinitol, control, and standard group. Additionally, inflammatory and NF-kB pathway gene levels in the psoriatic mouse skin, which includes tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin [IL]-6, IL-17A, IL-23,TRAF3, NIK, IKKα, and RelB, were dramatically increased or decreased by treatment with D-pinitol. Histological and morphometric studies disclose the efficiency of D-pinitol. Finally, we found that D-pinitol reserved the TRAF3, NIK, IKKα, and RelB in the psoriatic skin, signifying that it restrains the commencement of NF-κB signaling pathways. The present results suggest that D-pinitol could prove to have tremendous preventive potential against the treatment and prevention of inflammatory disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639244>Assessing the readability of online resources for  treatment.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638166>The JAK inhibitor tofacitinib ameliorates immune‑mediated liver injury in mice.</a></h1><p>The prevalence of immune‑mediated liver diseases such as autoimmune liver disease or viral hepatitis has increased in recent years, and the side effects of pre‑existing treatments are a worldwide problem. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells play important roles in the development of immune‑mediated hepatitis and may serve as potential therapeutic targets. Tofacitinib, a new Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, is under investigation for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; it is also helpful in treating ulcerative colitis and . The roles of tofacitinib were investigated in conferring protection against immune‑mediated liver injury in mice. T cell‑mediated hepatitis was induced by concanavalin A (ConA). The mice in the treatment groups were administered with tofacitinib intragastrically before the ConA injection. Histopathological examination was performed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and the serum transaminase and inflammatory cytokine levels were determined using an automatic biochemistry analysis apparatus or cytometric bead array (CBA) kits. Flow cytometric analysis was used to detect Tregs and Th17 cells. Tofacitinib significantly decreased the hepatic injury induced by ConA and prominently decreased the liver transaminase level. The secretion of several anti‑inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)‑10 was upregulated in mice from the treatment group, compared to that in mice treated with ConA alone, while the expression of interferon‑γ (IFN‑γ) and tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α) decreased. Tofacitinib treatment increased the number of Tregs and reduced the number of Th17 cells. Furthermore, tofacitinib could relieve liver fibrosis under conditions of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The present results indicated that tofacitinib improved immune‑mediated hepatitis and restored the impaired Treg/Th17 cell ratio, which suggests that it may serve as a novel treatment approach for immune‑mediated liver diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652354>Benserazide is a novel inhibitor targeting PKM2 for melanoma treatment.</a></h1><p>The M2 splice isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) is a key enzyme for generating pyruvate and ATP in the glycolytic pathway, whereas the role of PKM2 in tumorigenesis remains a subject of debate. In this study, we found PKM2 is highly expressed in melanoma patients and the malignance is positively corelated with high PKM2 activity and glycolytic capability in melanoma cells. Suppression of PKM2 expression by knocking down markedly attenuated malignant phenotype both in vitro and in vivo, and restoration of PKM2 expression in PKM2 depleted cells could rescue melanoma cells proliferation, invasion and metastasis. With the data indicating PKM2 as a potential therapeutic target, we performed screening for PKM2 inhibitors and identified benserazide (Ben), a drug currently in clinical use. We demonstrated that Ben directly binds to and blocks PKM2 enzyme activity, leading to inhibition of aerobic glycolysis concurrent up-regulation of OXPHOS. Of note, despite PKM2 is very similar to PKM1, Ben does not affect PKM1 enzyme activity. We showed that Ben significantly inhibits cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo. The specificity of Ben was demonstrated by the findings that, suppression of PKM2 expression diminishes the efficacy of Ben in inhibtion of melanoma cell growth; ectopic PKM2 expression in normal cells sensitizes cells to Ben treatment. Interestingly, PKM2 activity and aerobic glycolysis are up-regulated in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells. As a result, BRAFi-resistant cells exhibit a heightened sensitivity to suppression of PKM2 expression or treatment with Ben both in vitro and in vivo. This article is protected by copyright.

Since S1P induces differentiation of keratinocytes, we examined whether modulation of S1P lyase and altered intracellular S1P levels regulate proliferation and differentiation of human neonatal epidermal keratinocytes (HEKn). To identify the physiological functions of S1P lyase in skin, we inhibited S1P lyase in HEKn with an S1P lyase-specific inhibitor (SLI) and with SGPL1-specifc small interference RNA (siSGPL1). In HEKn, pharmacological treatment with the SLI caused G1 arrest by upregulation of p21 and p27 and induced keratin 1, an early differentiation marker. Similarly, genetic suppression by siSGPL1 arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase and activated differentiation. In addition, enzyme suppression by siSGPL1 upregulated keratin 1 and differentiation markers including involucrin and loricrin. When hyperproliferation of HEKn cells was induced by interleukin-17 (IL-17) and IL-22, pharmacologic inhibition of S1P lyase by SLI decreased proliferation and activated differentiation of HEKn cells simultaneously. In addition, SLI administration ameliorated imiquimod-induced psoriatic symptoms including erythema, scaling, and epidermal thickness in vivo. We thus demonstrated that S1P lyase inhibition reduces cell proliferation and induces keratinocyte differentiation and that inhibition may attenuate psoriasiform changes. Collectively, these findings suggest that S1P lyase is a modulating factor for proliferation and differentiation, and support its potential as a therapeutic target for  in human keratinocytes.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693324>Biologics versus Immunomodulators for the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis: A Review of Comparative Clinical Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness [Internet].</a></h1><p>INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a disease involving inflammation conditions located in colon and small intestines. Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are two primary types of IBD with different characteristics. UC is a mucosal disease that often affects the rectum and all or part of the colon. Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish UC and CD clinically. The symptoms commonly seen in the patients with UC include diarrhea, rectal bleeding, tenesmus, passage of mucus, and crampy abdominal pain. The inflammation may cause major consequences, particularly a fibrostenotic obstructing pattern or a penetrating fistulous pattern. Depending on disease severity, the options of conventional treatment for IBD include 5-aminosalicylic acid agents, glucocorticoids, antibiotics, and immunomodulators. Immunomodulators include azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, and cyclosporine, and modify the activities of the immune system. The use of immunomodulators are associated with minor or severe adverse events, such as headache, infection, and certain cancers. Due to such risks, the use of immunomodulators needs to be closely monitored. Conventionally, a “step-up” treatment strategy usually include a sequential use of aminosalicylates, steroids, immunomodulators, and finally biologics. Medications such as 5-aminosalicylic acids or prednisolone are tried first. Biologics or pharmacological immunomodulators are particularly useful when patients are not responsive to steroids for induction or relapse prevention. BIOLOGICS: Recent advances in IBD treatment include biologics (also called biologic agents or biologic therapies), particularly for patients unresponsive to conventional therapy. Biologics are protein-based molecules that can block inflammation in several immune-related diseases. The first biologic approved for IBD is infliximab, a chimeric immunoglobulin (IgG)1 antibody against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. The usual dose of infliximab is to repeat infusion 5mg/kg every eight weeks. Infliximab was approved by Health Canada to treat rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque , CD, fistulizing Crohn disease (FCD), and UC. Currently, three types of biologics are approved for the treatment of one or both primary types of IBD: anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab), anti-integrin agents (vedolizumab) and anti-interleukin (IL) 12/23 IgG1 kappa agents (ustekinumab). PLACE IN THERAPY: Health Canada has approved several biologics or biosimilars for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in patients without adequate response to conventional therapy, including infliximab and vedolizumab. Although, infliximab and other biologics are often reserved for patients unresponsive to conventional therapy, some practitioners argue that early adoption of biologics or immunomodulators may be beneficial to patients with IBD. The benefits of early adoption may include avoiding toxic effects of immunomodulators and fewer adverse effects related to conventional therapy. It is uncertain whether early adoption of biologics or immunomodulators may be beneficial to patients with UC. This study aims to review the literature and understand the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of biologics and immunomodulators among UC patients naïve to both types of drugs.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664747>Evaluation of changes in expression pattern of oxidative stress genes under the influence of adalimumab.</a></h1><p>The  therapy consists of the inhibition of cytokines involved in inducing and development this disease. The aim of the study was to evaluate the changes in the expression of genes related to the oxidative stress phenomenon in the culture of normal human dermal fibroblasts of NHDF exposed to adalimumab. NHDF culture was exposed to adalimumab for 2, 8, 24 h periods. The control consisted of the same cells not exposed to adalimumab. The oligonucleotide microarrays HG-U133A 2.0 were used to analyze the changes in gene expression in NHDF culture. Analysis showed that there are 3881 ID mRNA involved in the induction and development of oxidative stress, the expression of which changes significantly due to the exposure of NHDF cells to adalimumab (p <0.05) among 1369 ID mRNA of them. These include genes associated with apoptosis, the p38 MAPK pathway and the PDGF pathway, and above all with pathways not yet classified. Studies have shown that 2 genes: NR4A2 and IL1RN, whose expression has changed the most, expressed as Fold Change (FC) seem to be the most promising molecular markers to monitor therapy and loss of cell sensitivity to treatment.

However, many disorders can affect the nail, among them are the onychomycosis and . Systemic oral therapy has been applied to treat these diseases, even presenting disadvantages including side effects, drug interactions, contraindications, toxicity, high cost and low patient compliance. A great option to succeed in dealing with the problems associated to oral therapy is the topical administration of drugs. However, nail composition, low diffusion through ungual route and reduced tissue bioavailability for topical treatments are limiting factors. These drawbacks can be overcome by promoting penetration through the nails by employing penetration enhancers.The review focuses on patents that highlight permeation enhancers applied to nail drug delivery to the treatment of onychomycosis and .Literature and patent searches were conduced regarding the topic of interest.The substantial literature and patent search revealed that permeation enhancers, especially chemicals, are great strategies for promoting ungual delivery of drugs.Nail topical therapy containing permeation enhancers is an attractive option to delivering localized treatments.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678057>Nanoparticle-coupled topical methotrexate can normalize immune responses and induce tissue remodeling in .</a></h1><p>Methotrexate (MTX) is an anti-proliferative drug used for treating inflammatory diseases including . Nevertheless, its use in localized therapy is impeded due to poor transdermal penetration. We show that MTX coupled with gold-nanoparticles (GNPs) demonstrates superior anti-inflammatory efficacy compared to MTX-alone in an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mouse model, significantly reducing γδ T cells, CD4 T cells, and neutrophils. Furthermore, it was well tolerated upon systemic and topical administration. In an AGR129 human xenograft mouse model, two-week topical treatment with MTX-GNPs inhibited skin hyperplasia significantly better than topical calcipotriol-betamethasone (TCB) and led to profound tissue remodeling, involving upregulation of extracellular matrix reorganization and downregulation of cornification and keratinization processes. The number of resident T cells in the grafts as well as IL-17 production drastically decreased upon MTX-GNP treatment. While both MTX and MTX-GNPs directly prevented proliferation and induced apoptosis of T cells, suppression of cytokine production was a shared mechanism of GNP and MTX-GNPs. In conclusion, MTX-GNPs influence immune and stromal components of the skin, leading to potent inhibition of pathogenesis in preclinical . MTX-GNPs surpass the efficacy of conventional MTX and standard of care, emerging as a non-steroidal, topical alternative for  treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We evaluated the performance of 5 mainstream CNN models (ResNet50, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet121, and Xception) on a subset of BCC and pigmented nevi of this dataset. We also analyzed the basis of the diagnosis results in the form of heatmaps. We compared the optimal CNN classification model with 30 professional dermatologists.  Results: The Xiangya Skin Disease Dataset contains 150 223 clinical images with lesion annotations, covering 543 skin diseases, and each image in the dataset contains support for pathological gold standards and the patient's overall medical history. On the test set of 349 BCC and 497 pigmented nevi, the optimal CNN model was Xception, and its classification accuracy can reach 93.5%, of which the area under curve (AUC) values were 0.974 and 0.969, respectively. The results of the heatmap showed that the CNN model can indeed learn the characteristics associated with disease identification. The ability of the Xception model to identify clinical images of BCC and Nevi was basically comparable to that of professional dermatologists.  Conclusion: This study is the first assistant diagnosis study for skin tumor based on Chinese ethnic clinical dataset. It proves that CNN model has the ability to distinguish between Chinese ethnicity's BCC and Nevi, and lays a solid foundation for the following application of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and treatment for skin tumors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624648>The Role of Ultrasound in Assessing Hand Joints and Tendons in Psoriatic Arthritis.</a></h1><p>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis, usually involving peripheral joints, associated with cutaneous , in the absence of rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies.The study included 28 patients diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis according to CASPAR criteria, presenting pain or swelling of the small joints of the hands and wrists, hospitalized in the Department of Rheumatology of the Emergency Clinical County Hospital of Craiova during 2016-2018.In the 28 patients, a total of 840 joints were examined clinically and by ultrasound. From the clinical point of view, out of the total, 32 joints were swollen while 59 joints were tender. Dactylitis was evidenced in 20/280 examined digits upon physical examination. MUS revealed the presence of synovial proliferation in 108/840 sites (12.85%), with grade 1 synovitis in 4 joints (3.7%), grade 2 in 94 joints (87.03%) and grade 3 in 10 joints (9.25%). Out of 280 examined fingers 5.71% presented dactylitis, the third digit being the most commonly targeted. Grade 2 tenosynovitis was found in 40 of the examined tendons, whereas 8 tendons presented with grade 3 tenosynovitis. The most frequently involved were the flexor tendons of the digits (38 out of 40 tendons with inflammatory changes), followed by the extensor carpi ulnaris and flexor carpi radialis tendons.Ultrasound has proven its utility in assessing joint and tendon inflammation to a higher extent that clinically expected.

A 4mm punch skin biopsy was taken from the psoriatic plaques of patients and normal skin of controls. ACh level was measured in the tissues by colorimetric method, while mAChR and nAChR gene expression was determined by real time PCR.The level of ACh was significantly higher in patients (5.95±2.69) than in controls (1.12±0.34) (p=0.000). mAChR and nAChR expressions were significantly higher in patients compared to control (p=0.000). A significant positive correlation was detected between the expression of nAChR in patients and the duration of  (r =0.463, p=0.010), and the BMI of the patients correlated positively with both nAChR (r =0.404, p=0.027) and mAChR expression (r =0.448, p=0.013).Abnormalities in the cutaneous extra-neuronal cholinergic system could be involved in  pathogenesis. The high expression of nAChRs in patients with longer disease durations might represent an attempt of the body to regulate the inflammatory cascade in psoriatic lesions.

It is currently unclear how complement integrates into our current model of molecular pathogenesis in HS and whether is represents a central component of pathogenesis, or a neutrophil-associated bystander. Levels of C5a in serum and tissue correlate with disease activity and degree of neutrophilic infiltrates in HS. C5a has been associated with Th17 immune axis activation in , rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease with strong similarities to TH17 activation in HS. Porphyromonas species (which are identified in the HS microbiome) are able to cleave inactive C5 into C5a implicating the cutaneous microbiome as an activator of complement. C3a and C5a are associated with activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, implicated in the inflammatory drive in HS. Complement receptors are present upon dendritic cells, monocytes, fibroblasts, and adipocytes which may broaden the potential contribution of complement to multiple aspects of HS pathogenesis. Dysregulation of complement receptor pathways have been documented in obesity, insulin resistance and polycystic ovarian syndrome leading to the possibility that complement may explain the epidemiological associations between these conditions and HS. The therapeutic potential of complement inhibitors in HS may be related to the therapeutic target (complement receptor or complement subunit), and the presence of alternate receptors (such as C5aR2) or ligands (including C3a, PAMPs and DAMPs). Integrating complement into the known pathogenesis of HS may aid in explaining the contradictory results between Phase 2 studies of C5a antagonists. It also allows for the identification of existing knowledge gaps to target further clinical investigation and research.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Advanced understanding of this pathway has led to the development of targeted inhibitors of Janus kinases (JAKinibs). As a class, JAK inhibitors effectively treat a multitude of hematologic and inflammatory diseases. Growing evidence suggests that JAK inhibitors are efficacious in atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata, , and vitiligo. Additional evidence suggests that JAK inhibition might be broadly useful in dermatology, with early reports of efficacy in several other conditions. JAK inhibitors can be administered orally or used topically and represent a promising new class of medications. Here we review the evolving data on the role of the JAK-STAT pathway in inflammatory dermatoses and the potential therapeutic benefit of JAK-STAT antagonism.Copyright © 2019 Howell, Kuo and Smith.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623858>[French adaptation of a new score for global assessment of  severity: The Simplified  Index (SPI)].</a></h1><p>Although several scores exist to assess  severity, most have marked limitations that rule out their use in routine clinical practice. A new score, the Simplified  Index (SPI), has recently been developed and validated in adults in Britain for such use. It has separate components for current severity (SPI-s), psychosocial impact (SPI-p) and past history and interventions (SPI-p), and it is suitable for either professional assessment or patient self-assessment. The aim of this work was to produce a validated translation of SPI into French (as spoken in France).The index was translated and validated using a strict methodology comprising respectively five and eight phases for the professional (proSPI) and self-administered instruments (saSPI). Translation of the saSPI instrument also involved a cognitive debriefing with five  patients.Linguistic discrepancies and subtle differences of meaning arising during the process were closely examined. The developer of the instrument ensured conceptual accuracy. A panel of health experts guaranteed that medical terms were correctly translated. Five patients with plaque  (two female and three male of median age 45 years [range: 31-78]) tested the SPI-p version during cognitive interviews and found the questionnaire clear and easy to understand.Validated French translations of both SPI instruments are now available for use in routine clinical practice. Further investigations are currently underway to validate the psychometric properties of the instrument.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Treatment of PsA dramatically changed since the introduction of anti-TNF drugs which have shown to reduce the symptoms and signs of the disease and slow the radiographic progression. Despite the introduction of new molecules with different mechanisms of action, the role of anti-TNF in the treatment of all disease manifestations of this intriguing disease is still central. : The aim of this paper is to review the role of anti-TNF drugs in the treatment of different disease domains in PsA (peripheral and axial joints, skin, enthesis, patient's reported outcomes, extra-articular manifestations), reporting data from randomized clinical trials and observational studies. An extensive literature search was performed on PubMed, with no limits or filters. The following search terms were used: "anti-TNF", "Psoriatic Arthritis". : Despite the emergence of different new treatments, anti-TNF therapy remains central in the management of all disease domains in PsA patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655064>Skin Patterning in  by Spatial Interactions between Pathogenic Cytokines.</a></h1><p>Disorders of human skin manifest themselves with patterns of lesions ranging from simple scattered spots to complex rings and spirals. These patterns are an essential characteristic of skin disease, yet the mechanisms through which they arise remain unknown. Here we show that all known patterns of , a common inflammatory skin disease, can be explained in terms of reaction-diffusion. We constructed a computational model based on the known interactions between the main pathogenic cytokines: interleukins IL-17 and IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor TNF-α. Simulations revealed that the parameter space of the model contained all classes of psoriatic lesion patterns. They also faithfully reproduced the growth and evolution of the plaques and the response to treatment by cytokine targeting. Thus the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, such as , may be readily understood in the framework of the stimulatory and inhibitory interactions between a few diffusing mediators.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Transdermal drug delivery offers a desirable alternative to the conventional approaches, but the performances of current available skin penetration enhancement techniques are not so satisfactory. To address these limitations, we developed a dissolving microneedle (MN) patch made of hyaluronic acid (HA) with excellent water-solubility, biocompatibility, biodegradability and mechanical property. The amount of MTX encapsulated in the needles of the patch could be controlled during fabrication process for precise dosage. Interestingly, the MTX-loaded MNs successfully penetrated imiquimod (IMQ)-induced thickened epidermis in mice and delivered the drug intralesionally. Meanwhile, fast dissolution of HA endowed the MNs with operability for patients. We found the MTX-loaded MNs not only showed well-maintained inhibitory effect in vitro but also alleviated the -like skin inflammation in mice. Moreover, the MTX-loaded MNs were significantly more efficacious than taking the same dose of drug orally. Consequently, a higher oral dose of MTX was required for a comparable amelioration, which in turn increased its systemic toxicity.

To investigate the pathophysiological impact of dermokine, we generated mice deficient for two (βγ) or all dermokine isoforms (αβγ). Both variants, especially dermokine αβγ-deficient mice exhibited scale and wrinkle formation resembling ichthyosis accompanied by transepidermal water imbalance at the neonatal stage. When reared under low humidity several dermokine αβγ-deficient mice died by postnatal day 21. Moreover, the cornified envelope (CE) was vulnerable, and skin barrier lipid ceramides were reduced in the epidermis of dermokine αβγ-deficient mice. cDNA microarray and quantitative RT-PCR assays of the epidermis revealed upregulation of small proline-rich protein and late CE family members, as well as antimicrobial peptides in dermokine αβγ-deficient mice. These barrier gene signatures were similar to that seen in , whereas recent studies demonstrated that congenital ichthyosis has gene profiles resembling . In line with these findings, adult dermokine αβγ-deficient mice exhibited aggravated phenotypes in -like dermatitis models but not in allergic dermatitis models.

Monoclonal antibodies are typically derived from a clonal expansion of antibody producing malignant human plasma cells. The initial monoclonal antibodies were created by fusing spleen cells from an immunized mouse with human or mouse myeloma cells (malignant self-perpetuating antibody producing cells), and selecting out and cloning the hybrid cells (hybridomas) that produced the desired antibody reactivity. These initial monoclonal products were mouse antibodies and were very valuable in laboratory and animal research and diagnostic assays, but were problematic as therapeutic agents because of immune reactions to the foreign mouse protein. Subsequently, production of chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibodies and means of further “humanizing” them and producing fully human recombinant monoclonal antibodies were developed. The conventions used in nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies indicate whether they are mouse (-omab), chimeric (-ximab), humanized (-zumab) or fully human (-umab). Monoclonal antibodies have broad clinical and experimental medical uses. Many of the initial monoclonal antibodies used in clinical medicine were immunomodulatory agents with activity against specific immune cells, such as CD4 or CD3 lymphocytes, which are important in the pathogenesis of rejection after solid organ transplantation. Subsequently, monoclonal antibodies were prepared against specific cytokines (anti-cytokines), which were believed to play a role in cell and tissue damage in immunologically mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, alkylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and , among others. In addition, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies were developed, aimed at blocking or inhibiting the activity of specific enzymes, cell surface transporters or signaling molecules and have been used in cancer chemotherapy and to treat severe viral infections. Use of monoclonal antibodies is currently broadening to therapy of other severe, nonmalignant conditions including asthma, atopic dermatitis, migraine headaches, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis and viral or bacterial infections. Thus, the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies do not fall into a single class and have broad therapeutic uses. As of 2018, more than 60 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are approved and in use in the United States. Monoclonal antibodies are generally well tolerated. Because they are large proteins (typically 150-200,000 daltons in size) they require parenteral, often intravenous, administration. Circulating proteins are metabolized by many cells, but particularly by hepatocytes. Proteins undergo hepatic uptake by endocytosis and are either degraded or recycled to the cell surface for secretion. The hepatic metabolism of antibodies often determines their half-life. Proteins are broken down by cellular proteases into small peptides and amino acids that can used to synthesize other proteins. Metabolism of proteins does not generate toxic intermediates and, therefore, monoclonal antibodies are unlikely to induce drug induced liver injury via production of toxic metabolites. On the other hand, the peptides that are generated by the metabolism of the exogenously administered protein may ultimately be presented as foreign epitopes and generate an immune response. In addition, the primary effect of the monoclonal antibody may generate a response, either immune or otherwise, that leads to an immune mediate hepatic injury. Finally, monoclonal antibodies that suppress the immune system may cause reactivation of latent infections, including tuberculosis and hepatitis B.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689137>Risk of atypical mycobacterial infections in  patients during IL-17 inhibitor therapy.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662800>Cardiovascular risk factors in psoriatic disease:   psoriatic arthritis.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671471>Discovery of IgG4 Anti-Gliadin Autoantibody as a Potential Biomarker of  Using an Autoantigen Array.</a></h1><p> is a complex immunological skin disease.

Treatment with beta-adrenoceptor (ADRB) antagonists (beta-blockers) is associated with induction or aggravation of -like skin inflammation, yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Herein, we identify lysosomotropic beta-blockers as critical inducers of IL23A in human monocyte-derived Langerhans-like cells under sterile-inflammatory conditions. Cytokine release was not mediated by cAMP, suggesting the involvement of ADRB-independent pathways. NFKB/NF-κB and MAPK14/p38 activation was required for propranolol-induced IL23A secretion whereas the NLRP3 inflammasome was dispensable. MAPK14 regulated recruitment of RELB to  promoter regions. Without affecting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, propranolol increased lysosomal pH and induced a late-stage block in macroautophagy/autophagy. Propranolol specifically induced reactive oxygen species production, which was critical for IL23A secretion, in Langerhans-like cells.

We aimed to determine whether anti-HDL antibodies (aHDL) are present in patients with . Sixty-seven patients with  were compared with a healthy control group. Epidemiologic and clinical data were recorded. IgG and IgM aHDL, IgG anti-apolipoprotein A-I (aApoA-I), anti-apolipoprotein E (aApoE), and anti-paraoxonase 1 (aPON1) antibodies, as well as VCAM-1, IL-6, and TNF-α were assessed by ELISA. Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) were measured by immunoturbidimetric immunoassay. Patients with  had higher titers of IgG aHDL (p < 0.001), IgG aApoA-I (p = 0.001) and aApoE antibodies (p < 0.001). IgG aHDL and aApoE titers were higher in patients with severe  (p = 0.010 and p = 0.018, respectively). Multiple regression analysis, considering all clinical and biological variables, showed that aApoE, IL-6, and aPON1 are the biological variables that best explain aHDL variability. This is the first report showing the presence of aHDL, aApoA-I, and aApoE antibodies in patients with . These antibodies were associated with increased disease severity and may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in . They may fulfill the clinical need for biomarkers of cardiovascular risk associated with  that would help to stratify patients for prevention and therapeutic approaches.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633682>Precision Implementation of Minimal Erythema Dose (MED) Testing to Assess Individual Variation in Human Inflammatory Response.</a></h1><p>Minimal erythema dose (MED) testing is frequently used in clinical settings for determining the smallest amount of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation necessary to produce erythema (inflammatory reddening) on the surface of the skin. In this context, the MED is regarded as a key factor in determining starting doses for UV phototherapy for common skin conditions such as  and eczema. In research settings, MED testing also has potential to be a powerful tool for assessing within- and between-persons variation in inflammatory responses. However, MED testing has not been widely adopted for use in research settings, likely owing to a lack of published guidelines, which is a barrier to obtaining reproducible results from this assay. Also, protocols and equipment for establishing MED vary widely, making it difficult to compare results across laboratories. Here, we describe a precise and reproducible method to induce and measure superficial erythema using newly designed protocols and methods that can easily be adapted to other equipment and laboratory environments. The method described here includes detail on procedures that will allow extrapolation of a standardized dosage schedule to other equipment so that this protocol can be adapted to any UV radiation source.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687468>Eczematous eruption after guselkumab treatment for .</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612467>Biological therapy for pustular : a systematic review.</a></h1><p>The anecdotic evidence of the benefits from biologic agents for  is extensive. However, data on the efficacy of biologic agents for pustular  are limited.To update the data on the efficacy and safety of biologic agents for the management of pustular . A systematic review of published data regarding biologic therapies on PubMED database, used in the management of pustular  from 2012 was undertaken.A total of 209 articles were identified, and 43 articles were selected for inclusion. TNF-α inhibitors were used in 205 patients, and 86 patients received ustekinumab, secukinumab, brodalumab, ixekizumab and IL-1 inhibitors. Overall response was favorable for most modalities. No serious adverse events were reported. Inconsistent measures of treatment response and study variability limited the overall evaluation of data.Infliximab and ustekinumab have the most evidence of efficacy and safety for the treatment of pustular . Recent evidence supports the use of IL-17 antagonists. Prospective controlled and comparative trials are needed to further explore the efficacy and safety of biologic agents in order to establish objective recommendations for the management of this challenging condition.© 2019 The International Society of Dermatology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661476>[Humanized Mouse Models as a Tool to Study Proinflammatory Cytokine Overexpression].</a></h1><p>Dysregulated proinflammatory cytokine expression may result in the development of severe pathologies, such as rheumatoid arthritis, , and neurodegenerative diseases. Transgenic mice and, in particular, those with controllable systemic overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines have recently become an essential instrument to study the molecular mechanisms underlying disease development. Importantly, many of the models are humanized by introducing a human cytokine gene, while leaving or removing the respective endogenous mouse gene. Humanized mice are especially valuable for biomedical research as they provide a relevant model to develop therapies based on blocking the pathogenic activity of a cytokine or to establish the functional significance of genome polymorphisms. The review discusses the available humanized mouse models with overexpression of key proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-ip, and IL-6) and inflammatory cytokines with more specific functions (IL-8, IL-17, and IL-32) and their significance for basic and clinical research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664863>Dermatology nurses view on factors related to Danish  patients' adherence to topical drugs: A focus group study.</a></h1><p> Topical medications are first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate , but adherence is low, which negatively affects patients' outcomes and quality of life. Nurses can play a central role in patient care, particularly in improving adherence. To explore the experience of dermatology nurses with  patients' adherence to topical drugs.: We conducted a semi-structured focus group study with 6 dermatology nurses and 2 dermatology nursing students. Participants were recruited from a dermatology hospital outpatient clinic. Data were analyzed by a systematic text condensation method with a phenomenological-hermeneutic approach. Nurses experienced that factors such as social inequality, patient-centered nursing, and patients' quality of life can have an influence on adherence. Optimal adherence to topical treatments is a complex exercise and is influenced by many different factors. Involving nurses when prescribing topical treatments may be beneficial since they are one of the most trustworthy professions and have a holistic view on  severity, patient preferences, health care resources available and socioeconomic factors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627796>, Second Edition.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644231>Ixekizumab.</a></h1><p>Ixekizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody to interleukin-17A which acts as an antiinflammatory agent and is used to treat moderate-to-severe plaque .

We aimed to analyze and correlate known existing data on the epidemiological, clinical, histological, and immunological features of anti-p200 pemphigoid. We performed a review using Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases (1900-2018). Case reports and series of patients were included. A total of 68 eligible studies that comprised 113 anti-p200 pemphigoid patients were included in the qualitative analysis, where there was a mean age of onset of 65.5 years. All patients presented with bullae/vesicles, and 54.3% had urticarial plaques. A similarity to bullous pemphigoid was reported in 66.1% of cases, but palmoplantar (51.4%), cephalic (40.3%), and mucosal (38.5%) involvement, besides frequent development of scars/milia (15.7%), were reported. Autoantibodies against recombinant laminin γ1 were detected in the sera of 73.1% of patients.  was present in 28.3% of anti-p200 pemphigoid patients, particularly among Japanese patients (56.4%). The incidence of pustular  in this subgroup, was significantly greater than in the normal population. In conclusion, the diagnosis of anti-p200 pemphigoid may be suspected when a subepidermal autoimmune blistering disease develops in a younger age group, along with significant acral and cephalic distribution and mucosal involvement.Copyright © 2019 Kridin and Ahmed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663659>Pre-clinical evidences for the efficacy of tryptanthrin as a potent suppressor of skin cancer.</a></h1><p>Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of indigo naturalis, a traditional Chinese medicine ingredient, against , a skin disease characterized by keratinocyte hyperproliferation and inflammation. The present study investigates the efficacy of tryptanthrin, a bioactive compound in indigo naturalis, against non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and the signalling events involved.Efficacy of tryptanthrin against NMSC was assessed using DMBA/PMA-induced skin carcinogenesis model in Swiss albino mice. Immunostaining for PCNA and ki-67 was used to mark proliferating cells in tissues. Haematoxylin and eosin staining and toluidine staining were employed to assess inflammation, and TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptosis in tissues. The signalling events were evaluated using Western blot, imunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. MTT assay and clonogenic assay were performed to assess the viability and proliferation of cancer cells, in vitro.In mice, topical application of tryptanthrin suppressed skin carcinogenesis. It attenuated inflammation, impeded the proliferation of hair follicle (HF) cells and suppressed the activation of β-catenin, a major driver of HF cell proliferation. Additionally tryptanthrin suppressed the activation of ERK1/2 and p38, both of which promote β-catenin activation and lowered the expression of c-Myc and cyclin-D1. Tryptanthrin suppressed the proliferation of the human NMSC cell line, A431 and abrogated EGF-induced activation of β-catenin and subsequent cytoskeletal rearrangement.The study demonstrates with molecular evidence that tryptanthrin is an effective suppressor of NMSC.© 2019 The Authors.
