Therefore, rats were fed on fructose (10%w/v) for 6 weeks. Rats in treatment groups received amlodipine 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg of DB-Cr separately in concurrent to fructose. Various parameters of  perturbations were assessed at the end of study. Further, DB-Cr was analyzed using LC-MS technique. DB-Cr exerted remarkable antihypertensive effect whereas, sympathetic hyperactivity and hyperinsulinemia in these rats was significantly blunted, further, endothelium functionality was successfully restored. LC-MS analysis of DB-Cr revealed the presence of a variety of chemical constituents (41) including quinic , scopolin, gingerol, Robinetin 3-rutinoside, KAPA and maleic . In conclusion,  possess the potential to combat the fructose mediated hypertension and  perturbations, which may partially be due to its chemical constituents.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673296>Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor of atherosclerosis in patients with .</a></h1><p> (MetS) is a clinical condition potentially promoting the development of atherosclerotic disease. To date, the clinical impact of elevated serum homocysteine (Hcy) levels in MetS is still under discussion. The aim of this cross sectional study was to evaluate the relationship between MetS and hyperhomocysteinemia and the potential role of Hcy in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic complications of MetS.We recruited 300 outpatients with MetS. All patients underwent a medical history collection, physical examination, blood sampling and carotid ultrasound echo-color Doppler. According to Hcy levels, MetS patients were divided into two groups: "normal" (< 10.7 μmol/l; n = 140, group 1) and "high" Hcy (≥ 10.7 μmol/l; n = 160, group 2). Comparisons between groups were made by Student's t-test or Chi-square test. The effects of potential covariates on group differences were evaluated by general linear models. The relationships between continuous variables were assessed by simple or multiple correlation and by linear regression. Multiple regression models were built to evaluate the effects of Hcy, together with other potential risk factors, on carotid atherosclerosis.Patients with high Hcy were predominantly male and slightly older than group 1 patients. Smokers and non-smokers exhibited similar Hcy levels, nor was a statistical relationship between pack-years and Hcy observed. Group 2 showed lower levels of folic , vitamin D, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR) than group 1, but higher levels of C-peptide, uric  and triglycerides. In all patients, Hcy was positively correlated with C-peptide and uric  and negatively with folic  and e-GFR. Intima-media thickness (IMT) and carotid stenosis degree were significantly higher in patients with high Hcy and a positive relationship between Hcy and both IMT and carotid stenosis was detected in all patients. Finally, Hcy atherogenic effects were independent of other well-known atherosclerosis risk factors.Our results highlight a link between MetS and hyperhomocysteinemia and a direct effect of Hcy on atherogenic process during MetS. Early correction of folic  levels may contribute to prevent cardiovascular complications in MetS patients.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31509781>Improvement on  in high fat diet-induced obese mice through modulation of gut microbiota by sangguayin decoction.</a></h1><p>Our previous research found that Sangguayin (SGY) deccoction made by four dietary and medicinal plant components (Leaf of Morus alba L., Root of Pueraria lobata (Willd.)

Nevertheless, it remained unclear what the role of gut microbiota in the hypoglycaemia effects of SGY.This study aimed to examine the beneficial effects of Sangguayin Deccoction against  and and its regulating role in gut microbiota and hepatic metabolome.C57BL/6J mice were divided to a normal chow diet (NCD), high-fat diet (HFD), and high-fat diet with Sangguayin Decoction (HFD-SGY, oral dose of 250 mg/kg/d) for 16 weeks. Next generation sequencing was applied for analyzing the gut microbial community of colonic contents. Further, untargeted metabolomic analysis based on LC-MS was used for determining the changes of hepatic metabolites. Hepatic genes expression were measured by quantitative PCR.SGY supplement decreased blood glucose level and glucose intolerance. Illumina MiSeq sequencing revealed that SGY increased Verrucomicrobia phylum, resulting in a bloom of Akkermansia, and eventually upregulated the contents of Lachoclostridium and Roseburia. Additionally, dietary SGY decreased bacteria including Faecalibaculum, and Blautia. Moreover, the hepatic lipid metabolism was notably altered by SGY treatment. The oxidation of glutamione metabolism idecreasees, production of poly-unsaturated fatty  (PUFA) got significant increase in liver tissue. The reversion of PUFA metabolism by SGY may act through PPARα mediated Fads1 and Fads2 gene expression. The altered metabolites in liver showed intimate correlatship with modified genera.Data indicated that SGY reshaped gut microbial structure and improved PUFA metabolism. These functions of SGY may alter hepatic lipid metabolism, conferring preventative effects against high-fat diet induced .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated whether manual therapy (MT), in a chronic post-ischemia pain (CPIP) model, is capable of reducing pain behavior and oxidative stress. Male Swiss mice were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion (IR) to mimic CRPS-I. Animals received ankle joint mobilization 48h after the IR procedure, and response to mechanical stimuli was evaluated. For biochemical analyses, mitochondrial function as well as oxidative stress thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS), protein carbonyls, antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) levels were determined. IR induced mechanical hyperalgesia which was subsequently reduced by acute MT treatment. The concentrations of oxidative stress parameters were increased following IR with MT treatment preventing these increases in malondialdehyde (MDA) and carbonyls protein. IR diminished the levels of SOD and CAT activity and MT treatment prevented this decrease in CAT but not in SOD activity. IR also diminished mitochondrial complex activity, and MT treatment was ineffective in preventing this decrease. In conclusion, repeated sessions of MT resulted in antihyperalgesic effects mediated, at least partially, through the prevention of an increase of MDA and protein carbonyls levels and an improvement in the antioxidant defense system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31506465>Patched1 haploinsufficiency severely impacts intermediary metabolism in the skin of Ptch1/ODC transgenic mice.</a></h1><p>The study of dominantly heritable cancers has provided insights about tumor development. Gorlin  (GS) is an autosomal dominant disorder wherein affected individuals develop multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) of the skin. We developed a murine model of Ptch1 haploinsufficiency on an ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) transgenic background (Ptch1/ODC/C57BL/6) that is more sensitive to BCCs growth as compared with Ptch1/ODC/C57BL/6 littermates. Ptch1/ODC/C57BL/6 mice show an altered  landscape in the phenotypically normal skin, including restricted glucose availability, restricted ribose/deoxyribose flow and NADPH production, an accumulation of α-ketoglutarate, aconitate, and citrate that is associated with reversal of the tricarboxylic  cycle, coupled with increased ketogenic/lipogenic activity via acetyl-CoA, 3-hydroybutyrate, and cholesterol metabolites. Also apparent was an increased content/acetylation of amino-, glutamine and glutamate, in particular. Accordingly,  alterations due to a single copy loss of Ptch1 in Ptch1/ODC/C57BL/6 heterozygous mice may provide insights about the cancer prone phenotype of BCCs in GS patients, including biomarkers/targets for early intervention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31530060>Intrauterine growth restriction: the controversial role of perinatal adipocytokines in the prediction of  adult disease.</a></h1><p>"Prenatal/fetal programming," implying structural/functional disorders of developing tissues/organs, consequent to an adverse intrauterine environment leading to asymmetric intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), predisposes to  and noncommunicable diseases in adulthood, in the framework of the "Developmental Origins of Health and Disease" (DOHaD) concept.

The domino donor gets a deceased donor or a segment of live-donor liver through the deceased donor organ allocation system. Waitlist mortality for the domino recipient exceeds morbidity associated with getting the donor disease. Between 2015 and 2017, four patients with three  disorders at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh underwent DLT with domino allografts from maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) patients. These included patients with propionic acidemia (PA) (n = 1), Crigler-Najjar (CN)  type-1 (n = 2), and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency (CPSD) (n = 1). Mean follow-up was 1.6 years (range 1.1-2.1 years). Total bilirubin levels normalized postoperatively in both CN patients and they maintain normal allograft function. The PA patient had normal to minimal elevations of isoleucine and leucine, and no other abnormalities on low protein diet supplemented with a low methionine and valine free formula. No  crises have occurred. The patient with CPSD takes normal baby food. No elevation in ammonia levels have been observed in any of the patients. DLT for a select group of  diseases alleviated the recipients of their  defect with minimal evidence of transferrable-branched chain amino  elevations or clinical MSUD despite increased protein intake.

SIRT1 is a  sensor of cellular energy and exerts essential functions on energy metabolism, oxidative stress response, apoptosis, or aging. Importantly, SIRT1 deacetylates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), the master regulator of energy metabolism involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty  utilization. However, the exact role of SIRT1 in controlling cardiac energy metabolism is still incompletely understood and conflicting results have been obtained. We generated a cardio-specific inducible model of Sirt1 gene deletion in mice () to decipher the role of SIRT1 in control conditions and following cardiac stress induced by pressure overload. SIRT1 deficiency induced a progressive cardiac dysfunction, without overt alteration in mitochondrial content or properties. Sixteen weeks after  deletion an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a higher rate of oxidative damage were observed, suggesting disruption of the ROS production/detoxification balance. Following pressure overload, cardiac dysfunction and alteration in mitochondrial properties were exacerbated in  mice. Overall the results demonstrate that SIRT1 plays a cardioprotective role on cardiac energy metabolism and thereby on cardiac function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462242>The effects of Pandanus amaryllifolius (Roxb.) leaf water extracts on fructose-induced  rat model.</a></h1><p> is a non-communicable disease inclusive of risk factors such as central obesity, hypertension, hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia. In this present study, we investigated the ability of Pandanus amaryllifolius (PA) leaf water extract to reverse the cluster of diseases in an established rat model induced by fructose in drinking water.Thirty healthy adult male Wistar rats (150-180 g) were randomly divided into three groups which included control (C; n = 6), PA extract (PAE; n = 6) and  (MetS; n = 18). Food and fluid were given ad libitum for 8 weeks. These groups differed in fluid intake whereby rats received tap water, 10% of PA leaf water extracts and 20% of fructose in drinking water in group C, PAE and MetS, respectively. After 8 weeks, the MetS group was further subdivided into three subgroups namely MetS1 (n = 6), MetS2 (n = 6) and MetS3 (n = 6). The C, PAE and MetS1 were sacrificed. MetS1 group was sacrificed as the control for . MetS2 and MetS3 groups were treated with only tap water and 10% of PA leaf water extract respectively for another 8 weeks.

Understanding the lipidomic and transcriptomic profiles of WAT upon cold exposure provides insights into the adaptive changes associated with this process.Here, we applied mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to provide a comprehensive resource for describing the lipidomic or transcriptome profiles in cold-induced inguinal WAT (iWAT). We showed that short-term (3-day) cold exposure induces browning of iWAT, increases energy expenditure, and results in loss of body weight and fat mass. Lipidomic analysis shows that short-term cold exposure leads to dramatic changes of the overall composition of lipid classes WAT. Notably, cold exposure induces significant changes in the acyl-chain composition of triacylglycerols (TAGs), as well as the levels of glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids in iWAT. RNA-seq and qPCR analysis suggests that short-term cold exposure alters the expression of genes and pathways involved in fatty  elongation, and the synthesis of TAGs, sphingolipids, and glycerophospholipids. Furthermore, the cold-induced lipid dynamics and gene expression pathways in iWAT are contrary to those previously observed in , neurodegenerative disorders, and aging, suggesting beneficial effects of cold-induced WAT browning on health and lifespan.We described the significant alterations in the composition of glyphospholipids, glycerolipids, and sphingolipids and expression of genes involved in thermogenesis, fatty  elongation, and fatty  metabolism during the response of iWAT to short-term cold exposure.

During pregnancy, the dynamics of gut microbiota is involved in physiological adaptation. The disturbed profile of microbiome is associated with maternal complications, such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which further transfers to the offspring and influence their  and immunological functions in the long term. Prebiotics targeting the gut microbiota and modulating  and immune functions have been shown to be effective in non-pregnant populations with . Hence, we propose the use of a prebiotic supplement, oligosaccharide-sialic  (OS) from the first trimester until delivery in pregnant women, can benefit maternal/new-born gut microbiome, glucose metabolism and innate immunity.In this prospective double-blinded randomised clinical trial, recruited singleton pregnancies will be stratified by body mass index (BMI) and randomly assigned to consume the OS preparation or placebo daily from the first trimester. At seven later time points (before and after recruitment in the first trimester, in the middle and third trimesters, before delivery, at birth and 42 days postpartum), compliance will be evaluated and/or biological samples will be collected. Along with maternal clinical information, questionnaires on lifestyle and infant development will be recorded. The primary outcomes are the effect of OS on the maternal-offspring gut microbiome and GDM incidence. The secondary outcomes are maternal glycolipid biochemical parameters, cytokine profiles, weight gain during pregnancy and infant morbidities, growth and development. The study aims to validate the effects of OS on reducing maternal morbidity within different BMI groups. The multiple dimensional dataset generated from the study includes clinical and lifestyle-related information, various biological markers and associated protective or risk factors for morbidity and prognosis. An extended follow-up through 42 days after birth could further explore the intrauterine influence on the long-term health of offspring.This protocol has been approved by Peking University First Hospital, National Unit of Clinical Trial Ethics Committee (reference number: 164).

It has a unique function in the treatment of gastrointestinal dysfunction including irritable bowel  (IBS), is a common functional bowel disease. Its main symptoms are recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation or alternations between diarrhea and constipation. There are obvious differences in metabolites between TCM syndromes. By comparing the body fluid metabolism maps of model animals, metabolomics can discover disease biomarkers, analyze the differences in  pathways and understand the pathological process and the  pathways of substances in the body. Thus, the evaluation of animal models tends to be comprehensive and objective. This may provide further understanding between the interaction between Tong Xie Yao Fang and the IBS model.To evaluate the effect of Tong Xie Yao Fang on IBS rats by using metabolomics method.Wistar rats were used to establish IBS models, and then randomly divided into four groups: A model control group and three Tong Xie Yao Fang treatment groups (high, medium and low doses). A normal, non-IBS group was established. The rats were treated for 2 wk. On days 0 and 14 of the experimental model, urine was collected for 12 h and was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Nine potential biomarkers were identified, and six major  pathways were found to be related to IBS.In the study of metabonomics, nine potential biomarkers including L-serine, 4-methylgallic , L-threonine, succinylacetone, prolyl-hydroxyproline, valyl-serine, acetyl citrate, marmesin rutinoside and 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan were identified in urine, which were assigned to amino , organic , succinyl and glycosides. Furthermore, the  pathway of L-serine, L-threonine and 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan was found in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, which mainly involved the metabolism of cysteine and methionine, vitamin B6 metabolism, serotonin synapse, tryptophan metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, digestion, absorption of protein and amino  metabolism.

Our research efforts have led to the identification of adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, with the former shown to activate AMP kinase in the liver and the latter shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α signaling thereby increasing fatty  oxidation. Again, adiponectin upregulates mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle thereby improving glucose/lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. These findings suggested that activation of adiponectin/AdipoR signaling could represent a viable therapeutic approach to lifestyle-linked diseases associated with prevalent obesity thus contributing to healthy longevity in humans. Indeed, they have led to the successful discovery of AdipoRon, a small-molecule AdipoR-activating compound. Thus far, AdipoRon has been found not only to improve insulin resistance in mice but to prolong their lifespan shortened by high-fat diet. Additionally, our structure-based drug discovery research has led to AdipoR being identified as an entirely novel structure having a zinc iron bound within its seven-transmembrane domain as well as an opposite orientation to that of G protein-coupled receptors. It is expected that increasing insight into AdipoR signaling will facilitate the structure-based optimization of candidate small-molecule AdipoR-activating compounds for human use as well as the development of molecularly targeted and calorie-limiting/exercise-mimicking agents for lifestyle-linked diseases.© The Japan Diabetes Society 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385327>Targeted Analysis Reveals Alteration in Pathway in 5p minus Individuals.</a></h1><p>Cri du Chat or 5p minus  is characterized by a deletion located on the chromosome 5 short (-p) arm and has an incidence rate of 1 in 50,000 individuals worldwide.

We report that over-expression of MKL1, but not MKL2, activated the CRP promoter whereas depletion or inhibition of MKL1 repressed the CRP promoter. MKL1 potentiated the induction of the CRP promoter activity by PA treatment. Importantly, MKL1 knockdown by siRNA or pharmaceutical inhibition by CCG-1423 attenuated the induction of endogenous CRP expression in hepatocytes. Similarly, primary hepatocytes isolated from wild type (WT) mice produced more CRP than those isolated from MKL1 deficient (KO) mice when stimulated with PA. Mechanistically, the sequence-specific transcription factor CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPβ) interacted with MKL1 and recruited MKL1 to activate CRP transcription. Reciprocally, MKL1 modulated C/EBPβ activity by recruiting the chromatin remodeling protein BRG1 to the CRP promoter to alter histone modifications. In conclusion, our data delineate a novel epigenetic mechanism underlying augmented hepatic inflammation during NASH pathogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antioxidant and xanthine oxidase inhibitory potential.The enzyme kinetic studies performed on rutin derivatives showed a potential inhibitory effect on XO ability in competitive manner with IC value ranging from 04.708 to 19.377 µM and   was revealed as most active derivative. Molecular simulation revealed that new rutin derivatives interacted with the amino  residues PHE798, GLN1194, ARG912, GLN 767, ALA1078 and MET1038 positioned inside the binding site of XO. Results of antioxidant activity revealed that all the derivatives showed very good antioxidant potential.Taking advantage of molecular docking, this hybridization of two natural constituent could lead to desirable xanthine oxidase inhibitors with improved activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340443>Interaction of Dietary Linoleic  and α-Linolenic  with rs174547 in  Gene on  Components among Vegetarians.</a></h1><p>Fatty  desaturase 1 () gene controls the fatty  metabolism pathway in the human body. The lower intake of α-linolenic  (ALA) than linoleic  (LA) among vegetarians may disrupt the fatty  metabolism and limit the conversion of ALA to anti-inflammatory products such as eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the interaction of rs174547 in  gene with LA and ALA on  (MetS) components. A total of 200 Chinese and Indian vegetarians in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, Malaysia participated in the present study. The data on socio-demographic characteristics, vegetarianism practices, dietary practices, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure (BP), and overnight venous fasting blood samples were collected from the vegetarians. The rs174547 in  gene was significantly associated with MetS and its components such as waist circumference (WC) and fasting blood glucose (FBG). Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that vegetarians with TT genotype of rs174547 in  gene had higher odds for MetS, larger WC, higher BP, and a lower level of HDL-c. Two-way ANOVA analysis showed that LA interacts with rs174547 in  gene to affect HDL-c ( < 0.05) among vegetarians. The present findings suggest the need to develop dietary guidelines for vegetarians in Malaysia. Prospective studies are also needed to affirm the interaction between LA and rs174547 in  gene on HDL-c among Malaysian vegetarians.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571412>Impact of Acipimox Therapy on Free Fatty  Efflux and Endothelial Function in the : A Randomized Trial.</a></h1><p>Insulin resistance is associated with increased lipolysis and elevated concentrations of free fatty  (FFA), which in turn contribute to impaired vascular function.

According to epidemiological studies, father's transmission of environmental effects in addition to mother's can influence offspring health. Moreover, maternal prenatal dietary folic  (FA) may beneficially impact offspring health. The objective is to investigate whether prenatal FA supplementation can overcome the deleterious effects of prenatal exposure to POPs on lipid homeostasis and inflammation in three generations of male rat descendants through the paternal lineage. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (F0) were exposed to a POPs mixture (or corn oil) +/- FA supplementation for 9 weeks before and during gestation. F1 and F2 males were mated with untreated females. Plasma and hepatic lipids were measured in F1, F2, and F3 males after 12-h fast. Gene expression of inflammatory cytokines was determined by qPCR in epididymal adipose tissue. In F1 males, prenatal POPs exposure increased plasma lipids at 14 weeks old and hepatic lipids at 28 weeks old and prenatal FA supplementation decreased plasma total cholesterol at 14 weeks old. Prenatal POPs exposure decreased plasma triglycerides at 14 weeks old in F2 males. No change was observed in inflammatory markers. Our results show an impact of the paternal lineage on lipid homeostasis in rats up to the F2 male generation. FA supplementation of the F0 diet, regardless of POPs exposure, lowered plasma cholesterol in F1 males but failed to attenuate the deleterious effects of prenatal POPs exposure on plasma and hepatic lipids in F1 males.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643551>Gout Medications.</a></h1><p>Gout is a common  disorder caused by high body uric  levels, and marked by episodic deposition of uric  crystals in joints (acute gouty arthritis) and other tissues such as the kidney (urate nephropathy or nephrolithiasis). The underlying condition appears to be an increase in total body uric  stores and is usually marked by hyperuricemia. Hyperuricemia is typically defined as serum uric  levels greater than 7.0 mg/dL. Gout is more common in men than women and usually has its onset in 4th or 5th decade of life. Approximately 1% of adult Americans report having gout and 5% have some degree of hyperuricemia. Management of gout can be directed at treatment of acute attacks of gouty arthritis or to long term maintenance therapy directed at preventing attacks or decreasing the risk of uric  nephropathy or nephrolithiasis. Treatment of acute attacks usually rests on use of nonsteroid antiinflammatory agents such as indomethacin, naproxen, sulindac or celecoxib. Colchicine (1961: Colbenemid and others) is used both during acute episodes and in chronic maintenance therapy. However, the major approach to long term prevention of gout and the complications of uric  nephropathy is the use of uricosuric  such as probenecid (1951: Benuryl) and benzbromarone (not available in the United States) and/or inhibitors of xanthine oxidase, such as the xanthine derivative allopurinol (1966: Aloprim) and the newer nonnucleoside xanthine oxidase inhibitors such as febuxostat (2009: Uloric, Adenuric). Newer approaches to gout include use of lesinurad (Zurampic: 2015), a drug that inhibits the reabsorption of uric  in the distal tubules of the kidney, and use of recombinant enzymes that metabolize uric  such as pegloticase (Kystexxa), which is used in combination with xanthine oxidase inhibitors ito treat severe gout, and rasburicase (Elitek: 2002) which is used to treat the hyperuricemia associated with tumor lysis  induced by cancer chemotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628327>Trisomy 21 activates the kynurenine pathway via increased dosage of interferon receptors.</a></h1><p>Trisomy 21 (T21) causes Down  (DS), affecting immune and neurological function by ill-defined mechanisms. Here we report a large metabolomics study of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, showing in independent cohorts that people with DS produce elevated levels of kynurenine and quinolinic , two tryptophan catabolites with potent immunosuppressive and neurotoxic properties, respectively. Immune cells of people with DS overexpress IDO1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the kynurenine pathway (KP) and a known interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene. Furthermore, the levels of IFN-inducible cytokines positively correlate with KP dysregulation. Using  tracing assays, we show that overexpression of IFN receptors encoded on chromosome 21 contribute to enhanced IFN stimulation, thereby causing IDO1 overexpression and kynurenine overproduction in cells with T21. Finally, a mouse model of DS carrying triplication of IFN receptors exhibits KP dysregulation.

Up to 10% of individuals with PTEN CS, CS-like , or BRRS have germline SDHx (succinate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial complex II) variants, which modify cancer risk. PTEN contributes to  reprogramming; this is a well-established role in a cancer context. Relatedly, SDH sits at the crossroad of the electron transport chain and tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle, two central bioenergetic pathways. Intriguingly, PTEN and SDH individuals have reduced SDH catalytic activity, resulting in succinate accumulation; this indicates a common genotype-independent biochemical alteration. Here, we conducted a TCA targeted metabolomics study on 511 individuals with CS, CS-like , or BRRS with various genotypes (PTEN or SDHx, mutant or wild type [WT]) and phenotypes (cancer or ASD) and a series of 187 population controls. We found consistent TCA cycle metabolite alterations in cases with various genotypes and phenotypes compared to controls, and we found unique correlations of individual metabolites with particular genotype-phenotype combinations. Notably, increased isocitrate (p = 1.2 × 10), but reduced citrate (p = 5.0 × 10), were found to be associated with breast cancer in individuals with PTEN/SDHx. Conversely, increased lactate was associated with neurodevelopmental disorders regardless of genotype (p = 9.7 × 10); this finding was replicated in an independent validation series (n = 171) enriched for idiopathic ASD (PTEN, p = 5.6 × 10). Importantly, we identified fumarate (p = 1.9 × 10) as a pertinent metabolite, distinguishing individuals who develop ASD from those who develop cancer. Our observations suggest that TCA cycle metabolite alterations are germane to the pathobiology of PTEN-related CS and BRRS, as well as genotype-independent ASD, with implications for potential biomarker and/or therapeutic value.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

We present 1 case with Bartter , due to a novel compound heterozygous mutation in the KCNJ1 gene encoding the ATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.A patient was admitted to our hospital because of weakness, polyuria, and polydipsia. At presentation to our hospital, the female Chinese patient was 34 years old and her physical examination was normal. Laboratory studies revealed hypokalemia,  alkalosis, hypercalciuria, hyperparathyroidemia, and hyper-reninemia. In addition, urinary potassium was obviously higher. Computer tomography scan confirmed the patient had the bilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis.Blood samples were received from the patient and her parents, and deoxyribonucleic  was extracted. The genetic analysis of SLC12A1, SLC12A3, KCNJ1, CLCNKB, BSND, and CASR was performed. The compound heterozygous KCNJ1 gene mutation was validated using conventional Sanger sequencing methods.The patient was treated with potassium supplementation.

In order to evaluate the molecular mechanisms responsible for this sex specific response we performed a comprehensive  phenotyping, SILAC-based quantitative proteomics and characterized the involved signaling pathways by western blot analysis and gene expression. WT and VLCAD mice showed strong sex-dependent differences in basal metabolism and expression of proteins involved in the distinct  pathways, even more prominent after treatment with octanoate. The investigation of molecular mechanisms responsible for the sexual dimorphisms delineated the selective activation of the ERK/mTORc1 signaling pathway leading to an increased biosynthesis and elongation of fatty  in VLCAD females. In contrast, octanoate induced the activation of ERK/PPARγ pathway and the subsequent upregulation of peroxisomal β‑oxidation in males.

However, the specific interplay between KYDS and intestinal microbiota, and the intrinsic regulation mechanism of You-gui pill (YGP) on KYDS' gut microbiota remains largely unknown so far.In the present study, fecal metabonomics combined with 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis were used to explore the mutual effect between KYDS and intestinal flora, and the intrinsic regulation mechanism of YGP on KYDS's gut microbiota. Rats' feces from control (CON) group, KYDS group and YGP group were collected, and metabolomic analysis was performed using H NMR technique combined with multivariate statistical analysis to obtain differential metabolites. Simultaneously, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis based on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform and ANOVA analysis were used to analyze the composition of the intestinal microbiota in the stool samples and to screen for the significant altered microbiota at the genus level. After that, MetaboAnalyst database and PICRUSt software were apply to conduct  pathway analysis and functional prediction analysis of the screened differential metabolites and intestinal microbiota, respectively. What's more, Pearson correlation analysis was performed on these differential metabolites and gut microbiota.Using fecal metabonomics, KYDS was found to be associated with 21 differential metabolites and seven potential  pathways. These metabolites and  pathways were mainly involved in amino  metabolism, energy metabolism, methylamine metabolism, bile  metabolism and urea cycle, and short-chain fatty  metabolism. Through 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, we found that KYDS was related to eleven different intestinal microbiotas. These gut microbiota were mostly involved in amino  metabolism, energy metabolism, nervous, endocrine, immune and digestive system, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. Combined fecal metabonomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, we further discovered that KYDS was primarily linked to three gut microbiotas (i.e. Bacteroides, Desulfovibrio and [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes_group) and eleven related metabolites (i.e. deoxycholate, n-butyrate, valine, isoleucine, acetate, taurine, glycine, α-gluconse, β-glucose, glycerol and tryptophan) mediated various  disorders (amino  metabolism, energy metabolism, especially methylamine metabolism, bile  metabolism and urea cycle, short-chain fatty  metabolism. nervous, endocrine, immune and digestive system, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism).

This study was designed to identify the molecular mediators of kidney injury associated with  with or without hyperglycemia. We compared renal gene expression profiles in Zucker lean (ZL), Zucker obese (ZO), and Zucker diabetic (ZD) rats using cDNA microarray with quantitative verification of selected transcripts by real-time PCR. Compared to the 20-week-old ZL control (glucose: 110 ± 8 mg/dL), both prediabetic ZO (glucose: 157 ± 11 mg/dL) and diabetic ZD (glucose: 481 ± 37 mg/dL) rats displayed hyperlipidemia and kidney injury with a high degree of proteinuria. cDNA microarray identified 25 inflammation and injury-related transcriptomes whose expression levels were similarly increased in ZO and ZD kidneys. Among them, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) was found to be the most highly upregulated in both ZO and ZD kidneys. Immunofluorescence staining of kidney sections revealed a strong correlation between lipid overload and KIM-1 upregulation in proximal tubules of ZO and ZD rats. In cultured primary renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs), administration of saturated fatty  palmitate resulted in an upregulation of KIM-1, osteopontin, and CD44, which was greatly attenuated by U0126, an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. Moreover, knockdown of KIM-1 by siRNA interference inhibited palmitate-induced cleaved caspase-3, osteopontin, and CD44 proteins in primary TECs. Our results indicate that KIM-1 expression is upregulated in renal lipotoxicity and may play an important role in fatty -induced inflammation and tubular cell damage in obesity and diabetic kidney disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406461>Nanoformulations of natural products for management of .</a></h1><p> is a common  disorder which has become a public health challenge worldwide. There has been growing interest in medications including natural products as complementary or alternative choices for common chemical therapeutics regarding their limited side effects and ease of access. Nanosizing these compounds may help to increase their solubility, bioavailability, and promisingly enhance their efficacy. This study, for the first time, provides a comprehensive overview of the application of natural-products-based nanoformulations in the management of . Different phytochemicals including curcumin, berberine, Capsicum oleoresin, naringenin, emodin, gymnemic , resveratrol, quercetin, scutellarin, stevioside, silybin, baicalin, and others have been nanosized hitherto, and their nanosizing method and effect in treatment and alleviating  have been reviewed and discussed in this study. It has been discovered that there are several pathways or molecular targets relevant to  disorders which are affected by these compounds. Various natural-based nanoformulations have shown promising effect in treatment of , and therefore can be considered as future candidates instead of or in conjunction with pharmaceutical drugs if they pass clinical trials successfully.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31452582>Importance of Flaxseed and its Components in the Management of Hypertension.</a></h1><p>This review paper describes the effects of flaxseed and its components (flax oil, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside [SDG], flax lignan complex [FLC], and flaxseed protein hydrolysate [FPH]) on blood pressure (BP) in Sprague Dawley rats (SDR), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and humans. Flaxseed, flax oil, and FLC had variable effects on BP in humans, while SDG and FPH significantly reduced the BP in SDR and SHR. The effect of SDG was dose-dependent and long lasting. The lowering of BP is mediated through inhibition of soluble epoxide by  -linolenic  in flax oil, stimulation of guanylate cyclase and inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by SDG, and inhibition of renin and ACE activity by FPH. Flaxseed, flax oil, and FLC have variable effects on BP (none, slight, and significant). They are effective in lowering BP in individuals with hypertension and  but ineffective in healthy individuals' ineffectiveness of flaxseed and its compounds in lowering BP may be due to their low doses, long interval of dosing, short duration of consumption, and patient status. In conclusion, the data at present suggest that flaxseed, flax oil, and FLC cannot serve as therapeutic agents for the treatment of hypertension. However, they can be used as an adjunct in the treatment of hypertension. A clinical trial should be conducted of these agents with higher doses which would be given twice daily for long duration. Pure SDG and FPS may serve as therapeutic agents for the treatment of hypertension but they have not been tried in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553663>Sex modifies the consequences of extended fructose consumption on liver health, motor function, and physiological damage in rats.</a></h1><p>Sex-differences are evident in the presentation of  symptoms. Shifting sex hormones that signal the onset of puberty combined with a poor diet consumed in adolescence are likely to have sex-specific, long-term impacts on adult physiology. Here, we expanded upon existing literature to elucidate the sex-specific mechanisms driving physiological deficits following high fructose consumption. Male and female Wistar rats were fed a high fructose diet (55% fructose) beginning post-weaning for a duration of 10 weeks. Female rats on the fructose diet displayed elevated weight gain and extensive liver pathology consistent with markers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Males fed a high fructose diet exhibited increased circulating glucose along with moderate hepatic steatosis. Levels of cytokines and gene expression of inflammatory targets were not altered by fructose consumption in either sex. However, circulating levels of markers for liver health, including alanine transaminase, uric , and markers for epithelial cell death, were altered by fructose consumption. Combined with elevated circulating triglycerides, it was evident that liver health had deteriorated significantly and that a number of factors were at play. Both adult fructose-fed male and female rats displayed motor deficits that correlated with aberrant structural changes at the neuromuscular junction - however these deficits were exacerbated in males. These data indicate that consumption of a high fructose diet begun in adolescence leads to adult pathology that is modified by sex. Identifying these sex-specific changes has implications for treating clinical presentation of  and related disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462125>Lipidomics biomarkers in women with polycystic ovary  (PCOS) using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight electrospray in a positive ionization mode mass spectrometry.</a></h1><p>Polycystic ovary  (PCOS), characterized by oligo-anovulation and androgen excess is considered a high-risk condition for  disorders. Herein, untargeted metabolomics analysis was applied to women with PCOS, aiming to provide deeper insights into lipidomics biomarkers signature of PCOS, for better diagnosis and management. This was a cross-sectional study in which 15 Caucasian women with PCOS and 15 Caucasian healthy, age-matched women were enrolled. Lipidomics analysis was performed using Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole Time of Flight Electrospray Mass Spectrometry. Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis retrieved the most important discriminative metabolites. Significantly increased levels of triacylglycerol (18:2/18:2/0-18:0) in addition to cholestane-3beta, 5alpha, 6beta-triol (18:0/0:0) and cholestane-5alpha (18:1/0:0) appeared as valuable variables to differentiate subjects with PCOS from controls. Acyl-carnitine 2-hydroxylauroylcarnitine was significantly elevated in PCOS in opposition to decreased phosphocholines metabolites (18:1/18:4, 18:3/18:2), to suggest a  pattern linked to lipid peroxidation. A high fat intake or reduced fat energy consumption during nighttime due to diminished ability to switch to lipid oxidation during fasting time possibly contribute to hypertriglyceridemia found in PCOS. Furthermore, inflammatory mediators including metabolites of the prostaglandin (PG) E2 pathway and oxo-leukotrienes (LT) were increased in patients with PCOS. Potential lipidomics biomarkers were identified that could stratify between women with PCOS and healthy controls. The results show particular alterations in acylglycerols, PGs and LTs and phosphocholines and carnitine metabolites. The lipidomics profiles of PCOS indicate a higher risk of developing  diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415568>A conserved role of the insulin-like signaling pathway in diet-dependent uric  pathologies in Drosophila melanogaster.</a></h1><p>Elevated uric  (UA) is a key risk factor for many disorders, including , gout and kidney stones. Despite frequent occurrence of these disorders, the genetic pathways influencing UA metabolism and the association with disease remain poorly understood. In humans, elevated UA levels resulted from the loss of the of the urate oxidase (Uro) gene around 15 million years ago. Therefore, we established a Drosophila melanogaster model with reduced expression of the orthologous Uro gene to study the pathogenesis arising from elevated UA. Reduced Uro expression in Drosophila resulted in elevated UA levels, accumulation of concretions in the excretory system, and shortening of lifespan when reared on diets containing high levels of yeast extract. Furthermore, high levels of dietary purines, but not protein or sugar, were sufficient to produce the same effects of shortened lifespan and concretion formation in the Drosophila model. The insulin-like signaling (ILS) pathway has been shown to respond to changes in nutrient status in several species. We observed that genetic suppression of ILS genes reduced both UA levels and concretion load in flies fed high levels of yeast extract. Further support for the role of the ILS pathway in modulating UA metabolism stems from a human candidate gene study identifying SNPs in the ILS genes AKT2 and FOXO3 being associated with serum UA levels or gout. Additionally, inhibition of the NADPH oxidase (NOX) gene rescued the reduced lifespan and concretion phenotypes in Uro knockdown flies. Thus, components of the ILS pathway and the downstream protein NOX represent potential therapeutic targets for treating UA associated pathologies, including gout and kidney stones, as well as extending human healthspan.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523780>Effect of changes in adherence to Mediterranean diet on nutrient density after 1-year of follow-up: results from the PREDIMED-Plus Study.</a></h1><p>The prevalence of overweight/obesity and related manifestations such as  (MetS) is increasing worldwide. High energy density diets, usually with low nutrient density, are among the main causes. Some high-quality dietary patterns like the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) have been linked to the prevention and better control of MetS. However, it is needed to show that nutritional interventions promoting the MedDiet are able to improve nutrient intake.To assess the effect of improving MedDiet adherence on nutrient density after 1 year of follow-up at the PREDIMED-Plus trial.We assessed 5777 men (55-75 years) and women (60-75 years) with overweight or obesity and MetS at baseline from the PREDIMED-Plus trial. Dietary changes and MedDiet adherence were evaluated at baseline and after 1 year. The primary outcome was the change in nutrient density (measured as nutrient intake per 1000 kcal). Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models were fitted to analyse longitudinal changes in adherence to the MedDiet and concurrent changes in nutrient density.During 1-year follow-up, participants showed improvements in nutrient density for all micronutrients assessed. The density of carbohydrates (- 9.0%), saturated fatty  (- 10.4%) and total energy intake (- 6.3%) decreased. These changes were more pronounced in the subset of participants with higher improvements in MedDiet adherence.The PREDIMED-Plus dietary intervention, based on MedDiet recommendations for older adults, maybe a feasible strategy to improve nutrient density in Spanish population at high risk of cardiovascular disease with overweight or obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31397254>Nutrient and hormone composition of milk is altered in rodent dams post-bariatric surgery.</a></h1><p>Although bariatric surgery is approved for a woman of child-bearing age with an interest in subsequent pregnancy, reports of in utero growth issues during pregnancy have garnered a closer look at the impact of maternal surgical weight loss on the pre- and postpartum periods. Offspring of dams having received vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) are born small-for-gestational age and have increased risk for  later in life. Here, we aimed to determine whether the postnatal catch-up growth trajectory of bariatric offspring may be affected by milk composition. Milk samples were collected at postnatal day 15/16 from dams having received VSG surgery and fed a high-fat diet (HFD) (H-VSG), Sham surgery and fed chow (C-Sham), or Sham surgery and fed HFD (H-Sham). Milk obtained from H-VSG dams had elevated glucose (P < 0.05) and significantly reduced triglyceride content (P < 0.01). Milk from H-Sham dams had the lowest amount of milk protein (P < 0.05). Fatty  composition measured by fractionation was largely not affected by surgery but rather maternal diet. No difference was observed in milk leptin levels; however, insulin, adiponectin, and growth hormone levels were significantly increased in milk from H-VSG animals. H-Sham had the lowest level of immunoglobulin (Ig)A, whereas IgG was significantly reduced in H-VSG. Taken together, the quality of milk from H-VSG dams suggests that milk composition could be a factor in reducing the rate of growth during the lactation period.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450550>Association of Low Serum l-Carnitine Levels with Peripheral Arterial Stiffness in Patients Who Undergo Kidney Transplantation.</a></h1><p>l-carnitine is an important co-factor in fatty- metabolism, and its deficiency is associated with insulin resistance, which is independently associated with arterial stiffness. This study evaluated the relationship between serum l-carnitine level and peripheral arterial stiffness (PAS) in kidney transplantation (KT). Fasting blood samples were collected from 65 patients who underwent KT. We measured the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, and 36 patients (55.4%) had PAS. Patients with PAS had a significantly higher percentage of diabetes ( = 0.001), hypertension ( = 0.033), and  ( = 0.044); higher waist circumference ( = 0.010), systolic blood pressure ( = 0.002), serum triglyceride level ( = 0.040), insulin level ( = 0.002), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( = 0.002); lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( = 0.036) and serum l-carnitine levels ( < 0.001); older age ( = 0.041); and a longer KT duration ( = 0.025) than those without PAS. Statistical analysis revealed an independent association between PAS in KT and KT duration (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.003-1.054,  = 0.029) and serum l-carnitine levels (95% CI: 0.842-0.998,  = 0.044). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the diagnostic power of l-carnitine to predict PAS was 0.789 (95% CI: 0.670-0.881,  < 0.001).

From April 2015 to October 2017, 15,492 consecutive patients with diabetes diagnosed within 1 year and aged ≥30 years were recruited from 46 tertiary care hospitals in 24 cities across China. Glutamic  decarboxylase autoantibody was assayed centrally and clinical data were collected locally. Classic type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were defined using the criteria of American Diabetes Association, Immunology of Diabetes Society and World Health Organization. MetS was defined using Chinese Diabetes Society's criteria. Logistic regression analysis was used to obtain odds ratios (OR) of determinants of MetS.  The overall prevalence of MetS was 66.5%, with the highest prevalence in T2DM (68.1%), followed by those in LADA (44.3%) and T1DM (34.2%) ( < 0.05 for all comparisons). After adjustment for traditional risk factors, T2DM had a 2.8-fold [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.36-3.37] MetS risk compared with LADA, whereas T1DM had significantly lower OR than LADA (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50-0.92). After further adjustment for insulin resistance, the OR of T2DM vs. LADA was slightly reduced but the OR of T1DM vs. LADA was greatly attenuated to non-significance (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.70-1.33). In addition to types of diabetes, age, gender, geographical residence, education attainment, alcohol consumption and HOMA2-IR were independent determinants of MetS.  MetS was highly prevalent, not only in T2DM but also in T1DM and LADA in Chinese newly diagnosed patients; higher risk of MetS in LADA than in T1DM was partially attributable to higher insulin resistance in LADA.Copyright © 2019 Li, Cao, Tang, Yan, Zhou, Liu, Ji, Yang and Zhou.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574898>Plasma  Signature and Abnormalities in HIV-Infected Individuals on Long-Term Successful Antiretroviral Therapy.</a></h1><p>Targeted metabolomics studies reported  abnormalities in both treated and untreated people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLHIV).

We report here the results of a multi-omic study to identify drivers of anoikis escape, including transcriptomic analysis, global non-targeted metabolomics, and a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (GeCKO) screen of HGSOC cells cultured in adherent and suspension settings. Our combined approach identified known pathways, including NOTCH signaling, as well as novel regulators of anoikis escape. Newly identified genes include effectors of fatty  metabolism, ACADVL and ECHDC2, and an autophagy regulator, ULK1. Knockdown of these genes significantly inhibited suspension growth of HGSOC cells, and the  profile confirmed the role of fatty  metabolism in survival in suspension. Integration of our datasets identified an anoikis-escape gene signature that predicts overall survival in many carcinomas.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

This chronic thyrotoxicosis leads to progressive deterioration in bodyweight, tachycardia, and muscle wasting, predisposing affected individuals to substantial morbidity and mortality. Treatment that safely alleviates peripheral thyrotoxicosis and reverses cerebral hypothyroidism is not yet available. We aimed to investigate the effects of treatment with the T analogue Triac (3,3',5-tri-iodothyroacetic , or tiratricol), in patients with MCT8 deficiency.In this investigator-initiated, multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 2, pragmatic trial, we investigated the effectiveness and safety of oral Triac in male paediatric and adult patients with MCT8 deficiency in eight countries in Europe and one site in South Africa. Triac was administered in a predefined escalating dose schedule-after the initial dose of once-daily 350 μg Triac, the daily dose was increased progressively in 350 μg increments, with the goal of attaining serum total T concentrations within the target range of 1·4-2·5 nmol/L. We assessed changes in several clinical and biochemical signs of hyperthyroidism between baseline and 12 months of treatment. The prespecified primary endpoint was the change in serum T concentrations from baseline to month 12. The co-primary endpoints were changes in concentrations of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free and total thyroxine (T), and total reverse T from baseline to month 12. These analyses were done in patients who received at least one dose of Triac and had at least one post-baseline evaluation of serum throid function. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number .Between Oct 15, 2014, and June 1, 2017, we screened 50 patients, all of whom were eligible. Of these patients, four (8%) patients decided not to participate because of travel commitments. 46 (92%) patients were therefore enrolled in the trial to receive Triac (median age 7·1 years [range 0·8-66·8]). 45 (98%) participants received Triac and had at least one follow-up measurement of thyroid function and thus were included in the analyses of the primary endpoints. Of these 45 patients, five did not complete the trial (two patients withdrew [travel burden, severe pre-existing comorbidity], one was lost to follow-up, one developed of Graves disease, and one died of sepsis). Patients required a mean dose of 38.3 μg/kg of bodyweight (range 6·4-84·3) to attain T concentrations within the target range. Serum T concentration decreased from 4·97 nmol/L (SD 1·55) at baseline to 1·82 nmol/L (0·69) at month 12 (mean decrease 3·15 nmol/L, 95% CI 2·68-3·62; p<0·0001), while serum TSH concentrations decreased from 2·91 mU/L (SD 1·68) to 1·02 mU/L (1·14; mean decrease 1·89 mU/L, 1·39-2·39; p<0·0001) and serum free T concentrations decreased from 9·5 pmol/L (SD 2·5) to 3·4 (1·6; mean decrease 6·1 pmol/L (5·4-6·8; p<0·0001). Additionally, serum total T concentrations decreased by 31·6 nmol/L (28·0-35·2; p<0·0001) and reverse T by 0·08 nmol/L (0·05-0·10; p<0·0001). Seven treatment-related adverse events (transiently increased perspiration or irritability) occurred in six (13%) patients. 26 serious adverse events that were considered unrelated to treatment occurred in 18 (39%) patients (mostly hospital admissions because of infections). One patient died from pulmonary sepsis leading to multi-organ failure, which was unrelated to Triac treatment.Key features of peripheral thyrotoxicosis were alleviated in paediatric and adult patients with MCT8 deficiency who were treated with Triac. Triac seems a reasonable treatment strategy to ameliorate the consequences of untreated peripheral thyrotoxicosis in patients with MCT8 deficiency.Dutch Scientific Organization, Sherman Foundation, NeMO Foundation, Wellcome Trust, UK National Institute for Health Research Cambridge Biomedical Centre, Toulouse University Hospital, and Una Vita Rara ONLUS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the fact that oxidative stress has been demonstrated  and in animal models of AT and NBS, the involvement of redox homeostasis disorders is still unclear in the  phenotype of AT and NBS patients. Our study is the first to compare both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants as well as oxidative damage between AT and NBS subjects. Twenty two Caucasian children with AT and twelve patients with NBS were studied. Enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants - glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD) and uric  (UA); redox status-total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP); and oxidative damage products-8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), advanced glycation end products (AGE), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) protein adducts, and 8-isoprostanes (8-isop) were evaluated in serum or plasma samples. We showed that CAT, SOD and UA were significantly increased, while TAC and FRAP levels were statistically lower in the plasma of AT patients compared to controls. In NBS patients, only CAT activity was significantly elevated, while TAC was significantly decreased as compared to healthy children. We also showed higher oxidative damage to DNA (↑8-OHdG), proteins (↑AGE, ↑AOPP), and lipids (↑4-HNE, ↑8-isop) in both AT and NBS patients. Interestingly, we did not demonstrate any significant differences in the antioxidant defense and oxidative damage between AT and NBS patients. However, in AT children, we showed a positive correlation between 8-OHdG and the α-fetoprotein level as well as a negative correlation between 8-OHdG and IgA. In NBS, AGE was positively correlated with IgM and negatively with the IgG level. Summarizing, we demonstrated an imbalance in cellular redox homeostasis and higher oxidative damage in AT and NBS patients. Despite an increase in the activity/concentration of some antioxidants, the total antioxidant capacity is overwhelmed in children with AT and NBS and predisposes them to more considerable oxidative damage. Oxidative stress may play a major role in AT and NBS phenotype.Copyright © 2019 Maciejczyk, Heropolitanska-Pliszka, Pietrucha, Sawicka-Powierza, Bernatowska, Wolska-Kusnierz, Pac, Car, Zalewska and Mikoluc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31371402>The distinct phenotypic signatures of dispersal and stress in an arthropod model: from physiology to life history.</a></h1><p>Dispersing individuals are expected to encounter costs during transfer and in the novel environment, and may also have experienced stress in their natal patch. Given this, a non-random subset of the population should engage in dispersal and show divergent stress-related responses. This includes physiological shifts as expressed in the metabolome, which form a major part of responses to stress. We analyzed how  profiles and life-history traits varied between dispersers and residents of the model two-spotted spider mite , and whether and how these syndromes varied with exposure to a stressful new host plant (tomato). Regardless of the effect of host plant, we found a physiological dispersal  where, relative to residents, dispersers were characterized by lower leaf consumption and a lower concentration of several amino , indicating a potential dispersal-foraging trade-off. As a possible consequence of this lower food intake, dispersers also laid smaller eggs. Responses to tomato were consistent with this plant being a stressor for   , including reduced fecundity and reduced feeding. Tomato-exposed mites laid larger eggs, which we interpret as a plastic response to food stress, increasing survival to maturity. Contrary to what was expected from the costs of dispersal and from previous meta-population level studies, there was no interaction between dispersal status and host plant for any of the examined traits, meaning stress impacts were equally incurred by residents and dispersers. We thus provide novel insights into the processes shaping dispersal and the feedbacks on ecological dynamics in spatially structured populations.© 2019.

All women underwent clinical-anamnestic examination. Diagnoses of insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea  (OSAS) were made according to the results of specialized somnological questionnaires and polysomnographic monitoring. A multidimensional discriminant analysis was used to reveal the most informative parameters among the hormonal and  parameters studied (melatonin 06.00-07.00h; 12.00-13.00h; 18.00-19.00h; 23.00-00.00h; lipid profile, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defense system).The most informative indicators of the  system in Caucasians with insomnia are morning, evening, night melatonin, ketodienes and conjugated trienes, oxidized glutathione (GSSG); with insomnia and OSAS: morning, day, night melatonin, substrates with conjugated double bonds, total cholesterol; in Asian women with insomnia: evening, night melatonin, superoxide dismutase activity (SOD), diene conjugates, active products of thiobarbituric , cholesterol of very low density lipoproteins; in women with insomnia and OSAS: morning, day melatonin, SOD, GSSG. The recalculation of the informativeness of each attribute as a percentage showed the prevalence of the influence of the antioxidant protection system parameters over those of lipid peroxidation processes. The contribution of melatonin to the total share of the antioxidant protection system components is more than 60%.Both in Caucasian and Asian women with sleep disorders, there is stress in the antioxidant defense system, where melatonin is the largest contributor.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31353728>Antidiabetic activity-guided isolation of gallic and protocatechuic  from Hibiscus sabdariffa calyxes.</a></h1><p>We isolated and identified gallic and protocatechuic  as the antidiabetic principles in Hibiscus sabdariffa using solvent extraction, column chromatographic fractionation, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Ethylacetate fraction of the aqueous extract of H. sabdariffa inhibited α-amylase and α-glucosidase with IC of 411.73 and 433.93 μg/ml, respectively. Furthermore, fractions I and II obtained from column chromatography inhibited α-amylase with IC of 27.03 and 20.12 μg/ml, and α-glucosidase with IC of 24.30 and 22.29 μg/ml, respectively. In addition, the principles reduced the serum glucose and lipid peroxide levels of diabetic rats and with an improvement in the rat lipid profiles and antioxidant defenses. Fractions I and II were identified as protocatechuic  and gallic , respectively, using  H and  C NMR. Protein-ligand docking showed that these compounds form multiple favorable interactions with the active-site residues of the two glycosidases. Overall, protocatechuic and gallic  emerge as natural antidiabetic agents. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Hibiscus sabdariffa (Zoborodo) is a refreshment drink for ceremonial gatherings in Nigeria. Also, its pharmacological use includes diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, , and hepatoprotection. The consumption of this food drink could improve diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, , and liver disease.

Most traditional methods are expensive and time-consuming; therefore, developments of rapid, simple, specific, and sensitive methods for the assessment of vitamins and minerals in biological samples are of high importance in research. Aptamers are synthetic nucleic  single-stranded DNA or RNA that can be synthesized . They can be engineered to be analyte-specific and have been suggested as a substitute for monoclonal antibodies, due to their high sensitivity and affinity. In addition, aptamers can be chemically synthesized and readily modified for use as biosensors. These features make aptamers a promising tool for the detection of biological analytes. In this review, we provide an overview of the potential use of aptamer-based biosensors. Search terms were conducted on several online databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct from January 2000 to August 2019. Eligibility criteria were used and quality evaluation was performed. Following the review of 4349 articles, 39 articles met the inclusion criteria. Aptasensors have recently been developed for the detection of vitamins by using optical methods, with a detection range from 74 pM to 204 pM, and lower limit of detection of 2.4 pM. Both electrochemical and optical methods have been used for detection of minerals, however electrochemical methods show a wider linear range and lower detection limits compared to optical methods with a wide linear range from 0.2 fM to 1.0 mM and limit of detection of 14.7 fM. The current report reviews recent developments in aptamer-based biosensors for detection of vitamins and minerals. Studies have shown that aptasensors' properties are suitable for the quantification of vitamins and minerals with high sensitivity, affinity, and specificity. Nevertheless, the limitations and future directions of aptamers require further research and new technological innovation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654701>Adipokines underlie the early origins of obesity and associated  comorbidities in the offspring of women with pregestational obesity.</a></h1><p>Maternal pregestational obesity is a well-known risk factor for offspring obesity, , cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms by which maternal obesity can induce alterations in fetal and later neonatal metabolism are not fully elucidated due to its complexity and multifactorial causes. Two adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, are involved in fetal and postnatal growth trajectories, and both are altered in women with pregestational obesity. The placenta synthesizes leptin, which goes mainly to the maternal circulation and in lesser amount to the developing fetus. Maternal pregestational obesity and hyperleptinemia are associated with placental dysfunction and changes in nutrient transporters which directly affect fetal growth and development. By the other side, the embryo can produce its own leptin from early in development, which is associated to fetal weight and adiposity. Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, is downregulated in maternal obesity. High molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin is the most abundant form and with most biological actions. In maternal obesity lower total and HMW adiponectin levels have been described in the mother, paralleled with high levels in the umbilical cord. Several studies have found that cord blood adiponectin levels are related with postnatal growth trajectories, and it has been suggested that low adiponectin levels in women with pregestational obesity enhance placental insulin sensitivity and activation of placental amino  transport systems, supporting fetal overgrowth. The possible mechanisms by which maternal pregestational obesity, focusing in the actions of leptin and adiponectin, affects the fetal development and postnatal growth trajectories in their offspring are discussed.Copyright © 2019.

The study included 465 (266 males and 199 females) subjects, with mean age of 34.4 years and 32.0 years for males and females respectively. Anthropometric measures were obtained using standard protocols. Visceral adiposity was estimated using sex specific VAI.  Fasting blood sample was obtained for serum analyses of lipid profiles, glucose, protein and uric . Pearson's correlation was used to test the association between adiposity measures with MetS indices while Student's t test was used for group comparison. The results of the study showed that the adiposity indices significantly correlate with  indices. Visceral adiposity index was superior to other adiposity measures and Waist to hip ratio was the strongest anthropometric correlate of MetS components. In conclusion, WHR is the strongest anthropometric correlate of MetS components. Body adiposity index, NC and HC are weaker adiposity tools.

The You-gui pill (YGP) is a classic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula for the treatment of KYDS and has been widely used to warm and recuperate KYDS clinically for hundreds of years in China. However, it is unknown whetherthe corresponding targets and  pathways can also be found via using metabonomics based on one platform (e.g., H NMR) to study different biological samples of KYDS. At the same time, relevant reports on further molecular verification (e.g., RT-qPCR analysis) of these targets associated with biomarkers and  pathways have not yet, to our knowledge, been seen in KYDS's research. In the present study, a comprehensive strategy integrating systems pharmacology and H NMR-based urinary metabonomics analysis was proposed to identify the target proteins and  pathways that YGP acts on KYDS. Thereafter, further validation of target proteins in kidney tissue was performed through quantitative real-time PCR analysis (RT-qPCR). Furthermore, biochemical parameters and histopathological analysis were studied. As a result, seven target proteins (L-serine dehydratase; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; spermidine synthase; tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, glutamine synthetase; 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase; glycine amidinotransferase) in YGP were discovered to play a therapeutic role in KYDS via affecting eight  pathways (glycine, serine and threonine metabolism; butanoate metabolism; TCA cycle, etc.). Importantly, three target proteins (i.e., 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase; glutamine synthetase; and glycine amidinotransferase) and two  pathways (butanoate metabolism and dicarboxylate metabolism) related to KYDS, to our knowledge, had been newly discovered in our study. The mechanism of action mainly involved energy metabolism, oxidative stress, ammonia metabolism, amino  metabolism, and fatty  metabolism. In short, our study demonstrated that targets and  pathways for the treatment of KYDS by YGP can be effectively found via combining with systems pharmacology and urinary metabonomics. In addition to this, common and specific targets and  pathways of KYDS treated by YGP can be found effectively by integration with the analysis of different biological samples (e.g., serum, urine, feces, and tissue). It is; therefore, important that this laid the foundation for deeper mechanism research and drug-targeted therapy of KYDS in future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474092>Proximal renal tubular acidosis with and without Fanconi .</a></h1><p>Proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is caused by a defect in bicarbonate (HCO) reabsorption in the kidney proximal convoluted tubule. It usually manifests as normal anion-gap  acidosis due to HCO wastage. In a normal kidney, the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop and more distal nephron segments reclaim all of the HCO not absorbed by the proximal tubule. Bicarbonate wastage seen in type II RTA indicates that the proximal tubular defect is severe enough to overwhelm the capacity for HCO reabsorption beyond the proximal tubule. Proximal RTA can occur as an isolated  or with other impairments in proximal tubular functions under the spectrum of Fanconi . Fanconi , which is characterized by a defect in proximal tubular reabsorption of glucose, amino , uric , phosphate, and HCO, can occur due to inherited or acquired causes. Primary inherited Fanconi  is caused by a mutation in the sodium-phosphate cotransporter (NaP-II) in the proximal tubule. Recent studies have identified new causes of Fanconi  due to mutations in the  and the  genes. Fanconi  can also be one of many manifestations of various inherited systemic diseases, such as cystinosis.

Parenteral hydroxocobalamin (P-OHCbl) is the mainstay of therapy, but the optimal dose has not been determined. Despite early treatment, long-term complications may develop. We have analyzed the biochemical and clinical responses in five patients with early onset of different types of ICM defects (cblC: patients 1-3; cblA: patient 4; cblX: patient 5) following daily P-OHCbl dose intensification (DI). In patient 4, P-OHCbl was started at age 10 years and in patient 5 at age 5 years. OHCbl was formulated at either, 5, 25, or 50 mg/mL. P-OHCbl was intravenously or subcutaneously (SQ) delivered, subsequently by placement of a SQ injection port except in patient 4. In all patients, homocysteine and methylmalonic  levels, demonstrated an excellent response to various P-OHCbl doses. After age 36 months, patients 1-3 had a close to normal neurological examination with lower range developmental quotient. In patient 3, moderate visual impairment was present. Patient 4, at age 10 years, had normal renal, visual and cognitive function. In cblX patient 5, epilepsy was better controlled. In conclusion, P-OHCbl-DI caused an excellent control of metabolites in all patients. In the three cblC patients, comparison with patients, usually harboring identical genotype and similar  profile, was suggestive of a positive effect, in favor of clinical efficacy. With P-OHCbl-DI, CblA patient has been placed into a lower risk to develop renal and optic impairment.

It has two known enzymatic activities, acting as both a phosphodiesterase and a phospholipase. The majority of its biological effects have been associated with its ability to liberate lysophosphatidic  (LPA) from its substrate, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). LPA has diverse pleiotropic effects in the central nervous system (CNS) and other tissues via the activation of a family of six cognate G protein-coupled receptors. These LPA receptors (LPARs) are expressed in some combination in all known cell types in the CNS where they mediate such fundamental cellular processes as proliferation, differentiation, migration, chronic inflammation, and cytoskeletal organization. As a result, dysregulation of LPA content may contribute to many CNS and PNS disorders such as chronic inflammatory or neuropathic pain, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, -induced brain damage, traumatic brain injury, hepatic encephalopathy-induced cerebral edema, macular edema, major depressive disorder, stress-induced psychiatric disorder, alcohol-induced brain damage, HIV-induced brain injury, pruritus, and peripheral nerve injury. ATX activity is now known to be the primary biological source of this bioactive signaling lipid, and as such, represents a potentially high-value drug target. There is currently one ATX inhibitor entering phase III clinical trials, with several additional preclinical compounds under investigation. This review discusses the physiological and pathological significance of the ATX-LPA-LPA receptor signaling axis and summarizes the evidence for targeting this pathway for the treatment of CNS diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594827>Distinct Gut Microbiota Induced by Different Fat-to-Sugar-Ratio High-Energy Diets Share Similar Pro-obesity Genetic and Metabolite Profiles in Prediabetic Mice.</a></h1><p>Gut microbiota play important roles in host metabolism, especially in diabetes. However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different microbiota is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different fat-to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the microbiota and early-stage . The two diets resulted in different microbiota but similar diabetic states. Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic , cholestan-3-ol (5β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with lipogenesis and inflammation. Our study suggests that different -inducing diets may result in different microbiota but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of obesity and . Various types of diet can lead to type 2 diabetes. The gut microbiota in type 2 diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut microbiota induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease. Here we found that high-energy diets with two different fat-to-sugar ratios can both cause obesity and prediabetes but enrich different gut microbiota. Still, these different gut microbiota have similar genetic and metabolite compositions. The microbial metabolites in common between the diets modulate lipid accumulation and macrophage inflammation  and  This work suggests that studies that only use 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine how the microbes respond to diet and associate with diabetic state are missing vital information.Copyright © 2019 Shan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336561>Linseed Components Are More Effective Than Whole Linseed in Reversing Diet-Induced  in Rats.</a></h1><p>Linseed is a dietary source of plant-based ω-3 fatty  along with fiber as well as lignans including secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG).

Plasma levels of Ad are reduced in obesity, which contributes to type 2 diabetes. Therefore, agents that activate the Ad signaling pathway could ameliorate  diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Here, we report the identification of a high-affinitive agonist antibody against Ad receptors. The antibody was selected by using phage display of human combinatorial antibody libraries. The selected antibody induced phosphorylation of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and AMPK in skeletal muscle cells and stimulated glucose uptake and fatty- oxidation (FAO) in myotubes. In addition, the antibody significantly lowered blood glucose levels during a glucose challenge in normal mice as well as basal blood glucose levels in a type 2 diabetic mouse model.

Consecutive gout patients were recruited between August 2017 and December 2018. Demographic information, clinical characteristics and comorbidities were collected. BC was assessed by bioelectric impedance analysis including body fat percentage (BF%), trunk and limb BF%, appendicular skeletal muscle index. Overfat was defined by BF% ≥25% for male and ≥35% for female. The association between BC and serum uric  (sUA) was evaluated by multiple linear regression.  A total of 362 gout patients were recruited with median age 38 (30, 52) years, 96.1% (348/362) were male. Mean sUA was (551±133) μmol/L.

Male gout patients with overfat showed more affected joints [4(2, 6) vs. 2(2, 5)], higher sUA [(576±126)μmol/L vs. (523±134) μmol/L], higher prevalence of dyslipidemia [70.1%(131/187) vs. 54.0%(87/161)],  [60.8%(118/187) vs. 28.0%(47/161)], fatty liver [58.2%(113/187) vs. 35.1%(59/161)] and hypertension [44.4%(83/187) vs. 25.5%(41/161)] than male patients with normal fat (all <0.05). Their BF%, trunk BF% and limb BF% were positively correlated with the numbers of affected joints, sUA, , fatty liver, and hypertension, respectively (=0.154-0.435, all <0.05). Multivariable linear regression suggested that BF% (=4.29, =0.020) and trunk BF% (=9.11, =0.007), but not limb BF%, were positively correlated with sUA.  Overfat is very common in gout patients.

Resveratrol, a natural polyphenolic compound, has been reported to inhibit preadipocyte differentiation. However, the effect of resveratrol on human visceral preadipocyte (HPA-v) differentiation remains largely unknown. LIM domain only 3 (LMO3) promotes human preadipocyte differentiation by enhancing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) transcriptional activity, which is the master regulator of adipogenesis. The purpose of our study was to determine the effect of resveratrol (0-50 μM) on HPA-v proliferation and differentiation, and the role of LMO3 in resveratrol-mediated regulation of HPA-v differentiation. Resveratrol inhibited HPA-v proliferation and differentiation in a dose-dependent manner, and significantly decreased the mRNA expression levels of PPARG, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (CEBPA), fatty -binding protein 4 (FABP4), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and fatty  synthase (FAS) (p < 0.05) at 10, 20, and 50 μM. The mRNA and protein levels of LMO3 were significantly reduced by ≥20 μM resveratrol (p < 0.05), and overexpression of LMO3 partially attenuated resveratrol-induced reduction of HPA-v differentiation by enhancing the PPARG transcriptional activity. Together, our study suggested that resveratrol reduced HPA-v proliferation and differentiation, as well as LMO3, which was partially responsible for the reduction of resveratrol-mediated adipocyte differentiation.© 2019 AOCS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31353703>Crocin attenuates -induced osteoporosis in rats.</a></h1><p>In the current study, anti-osteoporotic activities of crocin were evaluated in a rat model of -induced osteoporosis.  was confirmed by increased body weight gain, increased fasting blood glucose, hyperinsulinemia, elevated mean arterial blood pressure, and increased serum triglycerides level. Crocin (5 or 10 mg/kg) protected against histological and architectural alteration in bone tissues. Further, it ameliorated the decline in the bone formation markers serum alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin level and inhibited the rise in the bone resorption markers serum tartrate-resistant  phosphatase and collagen cross-linking carboxyterminal telopeptide, type I. Crocin anti-inflammatory properties were confirmed by a significant decline in serum interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α. Crocin mitigated oxidative stress in femur distal epiphysis tissues. Mechanically, crocin enhanced both the longitudinal and perpendicular forces of femurs. The current data highlight a protective activity that can be attributed, at least partly, to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:  is a serious health problem. Its prevalence is present in approximately 25% of all adults. Complications of  include osteoporosis. This poses high risk of fractures and represents a heavy health, social, and economic burden. The current study highlights the antiosteoporotic activities of crocin in an experimental model of osteoporosis. Thus, crocin and/or other structurally related carotenoids can be lead compounds for synthesizing more potent and bioavailable molecules.

The biochemical consequences, underlying clinical manifestations, and potential therapeutic targets, remain to be better understood. We tested the hypothesis that lipid dyshomeostasis in mitochondrial disorders goes beyond mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation, particularly in liver. This was achieved using comprehensive untargeted and targeted lipidomics in a case-control cohort of patients with Leigh  French-Canadian variant (LSFC), a mitochondrial disease caused by mutations in LRPPRC, and in mice harboring liver-specific inactivation of Lrpprc (H-Lrpprc-/-). We discovered a plasma lipid signature discriminating LSFC patients from controls encompassing lower levels of plasmalogens and conjugated bile , which suggest perturbations in peroxisomal lipid metabolism. This premise was reinforced in H-Lrpprc-/- mice, which compared with littermates recapitulated a similar, albeit stronger peroxisomal  signature in plasma and liver including elevated levels of very-long-chain acylcarnitines. These mice also presented higher transcript levels for hepatic markers of peroxisome proliferation in addition to lipid remodeling reminiscent of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases. Our study underscores the value of lipidomics to unveil unexpected mechanisms underlying lipid dyshomeostasis ensuing from mitochondrial dysfunction herein implying peroxisomes and liver, which likely contribute to the pathophysiology of LSFC, but also other rare and common mitochondrial diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664610>Design, synthesis, molecular docking and in vitro evaluation of benzothiazole derivatives as 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitors.</a></h1><p>11-Beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) regulates cortisol levels mainly in adipose, hepatic and brain tissues. There is a relationship between the high activity of this enzyme and the development of obesity and  disorders. The inhibition of 11β-HSD1 has been shown to attenuate the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance,  and other diseases mediated by excessive cortisol production. In this work, fifteen benzothiazole derivatives substituted with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups were designed to explore their affinity for 11β-HSD1 using in silico methods. The results show that (E)-5-((benzo[d]thiazol-2-ylimino)(methylthio)methylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic  (C1) has good physicochemical properties and favorable interactions with 11β-HSD1 through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the catalytic site formed by Y183, S170 and Y177. Furthermore, C1 was synthesized and evaluated in vitro and ex vivo using clobenzorex (CLX) as a reference drug in obese Zucker rats. The in vitro results showed that C1 was a better inhibitor of human 11β-HSD1 than CLX. The ex vivo assay results demonstrated that C1 was capable of reducing 11β-HSD1 overexpression in mesenteric adipose tissue. Therefore, C1 was able to decrease the activity and expression of 11β-HSD1 better than CLX.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31510101>Microbiota, Microbial Metabolites, and Barrier Function in A Patient with Anorexia Nervosa after Fecal Microbiota Transplantation.</a></h1><p>The change in the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites in a patient suffering from severe and enduring anorexia nervosa (AN) and diagnosed with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth  (SIBO) was investigated. Microbial gut dysbiosis is associated with both AN and SIBO, and therefore gut microbiome changes by serial fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a possible therapeutic modality. This study assessed the effects of FMT on gut barrier function, microbiota composition, and the levels of bacterial  products. The patient treatment with FMT led to the improvement of gut barrier function, which was altered prior to FMT. Very low bacterial alpha diversity, a lack of beneficial bacteria, together with a great abundance of fungal species were observed in the patient stool sample before FMT. After FMT, both bacterial species richness and gut microbiome evenness increased in the patient, while the fungal alpha diversity decreased. The total short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) levels (molecules presenting an important source of energy for epithelial gut cells) gradually increased after FMT. Contrarily, one of the most abundant intestinal neurotransmitters, serotonin, tended to decrease throughout the observation period. Overall, gut microbial dysbiosis improvement after FMT was considered. However, there were no signs of patient clinical improvement. The need for an in-depth analysis of the donor´s stool and correct selection pre-FMT is evident.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430206>Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) as a therapeutic target for  and recent developments in ACC1/2 inhibitors.</a></h1><p>: Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC) is an essential rate-limiting enzyme in fatty  metabolism.

Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of GORD in subjects with IHD who present with acute coronary  (ACS) and to determine whether GORD may serve as a trigger for ischaemic events.Twenty patients with isolated reflux oesophagitis and 39 with acute coronary  (ACS with concomitant GORD) were studied. Twenty-two subjects comprising normal volunteers and those who were admitted for minor surgical trauma were used as normal controls. All subjects underwent oesophago-gastroduodenal endoscopy (EGD) and  instillation with hydrochloric  (0.1 M), as well as nuclear imaging (sestaMIBI) with technetium. Ischaemia was detected by ST depression using ECG monitoring for one hour during and immediately after EGD.Of the 111 subjects with ACS, 39 (35.1%) had erosive GORD and comprised the study group. Subjects with ACS had more incidence of diabetes (p = 0.001), hypertension (p = 0.002), a history of smoking (p = 0.006) and elevated serum triglyceride levels (p = 0.008) compared to the GORD group. Risk-factor clustering in the form of the  was more common in ACS subjects (44 vs 5%; p = 0.008). ST depression was documented in 8/39 (20.5%) patients in the ACS group and 5/20 (25%) in the GORD group (p = 0.958). Reversible perfusion defects on sestaMIBI scan were seen in 35.6% of the ACS subjects.Although GORD is common in subjects with ACS, we have not been able to show that GORD may serve as a trigger for ischaemia in these subjects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31396301>Antioxidant Effects of Oral Ang-(1-7) Restore Insulin Pathway and RAS Components Ameliorating Cardiometabolic Disturbances in Rats.</a></h1><p>In prevention studies of  (MetS), Ang-(1-7) has shown to improve the insulin signaling. We evaluated the HPCD/Ang-(1-7) treatment on lipid metabolism, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components, oxidative stress, and insulin pathway in the liver and gastrocnemius muscle and hepatic steatosis in rats with established MetS. After 7 weeks of high-fat (FAT) or control (CT) diets, rats were treated with cyclodextrin (HPCD) or HPCD/Ang-(1-7) in the last 6 weeks. FAT-HPCD/empty rats showed increased adiposity index and body mass, gene expression of ACE/ANG II/AT1R axis, and oxidative stress. These results were accompanied by imbalances in the insulin pathway, worsening of liver function, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia. Oral HPCD/Ang-(1-7) treatment decreased  and , increased  gene expression in the liver, and restored thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), insulin receptor substrate (), glucose transporter type 4 (), and serine/threonine kinase 2 () gene expression in the liver and gastrocnemius muscle improving hepatic function, cholesterol levels, and hyperglycemia in MetS rats.

Increased oxidative stress in adipose tissue contributes to the development of insulin resistance and  in obesity. The present study aimed to investigate the role of peroxisomal fitness in maintaining adipocyte function, which has been underrated in the obesity research area.Reduced peroxisomal gene expressions in white adipose tissue (WAT) of obese mice suggested a close correlation between peroxisomes and obesity. Pex5 siRNA increased cellular ROS and inflammatory mediators in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. On the other hands, H2O2 or TNFα treatment significantly decreased biogenesis- and function-related peroxisomal proteins, suggesting a positive feedback loop of ROS/inflammation and peroxisomal dysfunction. Correspondingly, catalase (a major peroxisomal antioxidant)-knockout mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) exhibited suppressed peroxisomal proteins along with increased oxidative stress and accelerated obesity. In response to fenofibrate (a peroxisomal proliferator) treatment, WAT of HFD-fed wild type mice showed not only increases in peroxisomal biogenesis and fatty  oxidation, but also attenuated features of adipocyte dysfunction and obesity. However, these results were not observed in PPAR-α null obese mice.

Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in population across different regions. According to epidemiological studies, CVD risk markers in childhood obesity are one of the significant risk factors for adulthood CVD, but have received disproportionally little attention. This review has examined the evidence for the presence of traditional cardiac biomarkers (nonspecific; lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, myoglobulin, glycogen phosphorylase isoenzyme BB, myosin light chains, ST2, and ischemia-modified albumin) and novel emerging cardiac-specific biomarkers (cardiac troponins, natriuretic peptides, heart-type fatty -binding protein, and miRNAs). Besides, noninvasive anatomical and electrophysiological markers (carotid intima-media thickness, coronary artery calcification, and heart rate variability) in CVDs and obesity are also discussed. Modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors associated with  in the progression of CVD, such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, inflammation, and adipocytokines are also outlined. These underlying prognostic risk factors predict the onset of future microvascular and macrovascular complications.

In this study, we aimed to understand the effects of low-dose Bisphenol-A on the human mature adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells, obtained from subcutaneous mammary adipose tissue of overweight female patients, undergoing surgical mammary reduction. 24 and/or 48 hours exposure to BPA 0.1 nM elicited significant increase of the inflammatory molecules interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), Monocyte chemo-attractant protein 1α (MCP1α) and induced G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 30 (GPR30) levels more than 2-fold both in mature adipocytes and SVF cells. These effects were similar to that obtained in presence of GPR30-specific agonist G1 (100 nM) and were reverted by G15 (1 µM), a GPR30-selective antagonist. As a result of BPA-GPR30 signaling activation, Fatty  Synthase (FAS) and leptin mRNA levels were significantly higher upon BPA exposure (p<0.05) in mature adipocytes, with an opposite effect on adiponectin (ADIPOQ). In addition, an increase in SVF cell proliferation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, was observed, compared to untreated cells. G15 reverted all of these effects. Interestingly, the action of BPA on SVF cell growth was mimicked by IL-8 treatment and was reverted by incubation with anti-IL8 antibodies. All these data suggest that BPA at 0.1nM, a 10 times lower concentration than environmental exposure, increases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines via GPR30 both in mature mammary adipocytes and in SVF cells with a possible involvement of IL-8.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362653>Bile  and Farnesoid X Receptor: Novel Target for the Treatment of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy.</a></h1><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) has become an increasingly common disease with high disability and mortality rates. Diabetes complications are the main cause of diabetes death and about 50% of diabetic patients died from heart disease in developed countries reported by World Health Organization. Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) has been considered as a high incidence and serious complication of DM and plays a key role in the incidence and development of diabetes related heart failure. Metabolism dysregulation is regarded as an important and earlier factor occurred in the pathogenesis of DCM. Insulin resistance, oxidative stress, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction also contribute to the development of DCM. Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) is a member of nuclear receptor superfamily, and plays a critical role in regulating lipid and glucose metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation. FXR is activated by primary bile  (BAs) such as chenodeoxycholic , cholic  and synthetic agonists such as obeticholic . BAs are the main active ingredients of many natural products and traditional medicines, especially bile or gallstones in animals, such as calculus bovis. Due to the regulatory effect of FXR on glucose and lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation, the treatment of BAs and FXR agonists for  and DCM have gained more attention. This review will focus on the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy and the regulatory effect of BAs and FXR on DCM.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31468681>Impact of bariatric surgery on serum uric  levels and the incidence of gout-A meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Gout is characterized by high serum uric  (SUA) levels and arthritis. It is associated with obesity and . Bariatric surgery has been associated with decreased SUA levels and overall gout incidence. This meta-analysis aims to summarize the current evidence on bariatric surgery, gout and SUA levels. A literature review was performed on papers published from 2000 up till December 2018. Original studies investigating the impact of bariatric surgery on SUA levels or gout incidence were evaluated. Twenty studies with a total of 5,233 patients were analysed. Majority (n=14) had a follow-up duration of at least 12 months. The mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 45.2kg m . The mean preoperative SUA level was 6.5mg dL . Subgroup analysis demonstrated a mean decrease in SUA levels (-0.73mg dL ) from the third postoperative month onwards, which was sustained until the third postoperative year (-1.91mg dL ). There was a rise in SUA levels in the first post-operative month. Meta-regression analyses demonstrated a proportionate linear relationship between the change in BMI and SUA levels. Post-bariatric surgery weight loss is associated with reduced SUA levels and decreased incidence of gout attacks. However, this is only evident from the third post-operative month onwards.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31548551>First demonstration of protective effects of purified mushroom polysaccharide-peptides against fatty liver injury and the mechanisms involved.</a></h1><p>Fatty liver (FLD) disease is a consequence of , which is a health problem worldwide with a phenomenal rise in prevalence. In this study, two hepatoprotective polysaccharide-peptides were extracted from the mushroom Auricularia polytricha followed by chromatographic fractionation of the extract on the ion exchanger DEAE-cellulose and gel filtration on Sephadex-200 to yield two purified fractions: APPI and APPII. The monosaccharide compositions, FT-IR, N-terminal sequences, internal peptide sequences and molecular weights of the two fractions were determined. Furthermore, their hepatoprotective effect on human hepatoma HepG2 cells in vitro and in an animal model of fatty liver disease was evidenced by the findings that APPI and APPII diminished lipid deposit in cells, blood and the liver, increased cellular antioxidant activity and viability, and protected the liver against injury. The mechanistic study revealed that APPI and APPII activated the adiponectin pathway, up-regulated expression of genes controlling free fatty  (FFA) oxidation, such as AMPK, CPTl, ACOX1 and PPARα genes, enhanced lipid metabolism, preserved hepatic function, promoted the antioxidant defense system and reduced lipid peroxidation.

Serum lipids and blood glucose are risk factors for . Thus, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of HUA and its relationship with serum lipids and blood glucose.A total of 59,074 cases (32,623 males and 26,451 females) from three hospitals in Lanzhou city from January 2015 to December 2018 were grouped according to serum uric  (SUA) level to analyze the differences in age, total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerol (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), fasting blood glucose (FBG), creatinine (Cr), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The changes of prevalence of HUA among different age and gender groups was analyzed. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation of SUA level with clinical indicators. The risk factors of HUA were analyzed by using binary logistic regression analysis. ROC curve was used to analyze the independent risk factors of elevated SUA.The overall prevalence rate of HUA was 19.87% and the prevalence rate of males was significantly higher than that of females (28.35% vs. 9.41%, χ2 = 3,289.143, p < 0.01). The prevalence rates of HUA from 2015 - 2018 were 19.54%, 19.31%, 18.64%, and 21.81%, respectively. Compared with the normal SUA group, TC, TG, and LDL significantly increased in the HUA group. The correlation analysis showed that SUA was negatively correlated with gender and HDL, and positively correlated with age, FBG, TC, TG, and LDL. The logistic regression analysis revealed that TG, TC, and LDL were risk factors for HUA. The ROC curve analysis showed that the risk of HUA significantly increased when TG was above 1.645 mmol/L.The overall prevalence of HUA in physical examination population has generally been at a high level in the past 4 years.

It begins with the accumulation of fat in the liver (simple steatosis), which if untreated can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Chrysin is a flavonoid present in bee propolis and many other plants. The objective of this study was to determine if chrysin can ameliorate NAFLD induced by feeding a high fructose diet (HFD) in rats. The rats were divided into five groups: normal control, HFD control, chrysin (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg p.o. body weight). Biochemical estimations were carried out in the serum and liver of rats. The gene expressions of SREBP-1c and PPAR α were determined in the liver. The histopathology of the liver was also studied. Chrysin caused a significant decrease in the serum fasting glucose and improved the insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and liver enzymes. It caused a significant decrease in the liver weight and hepatic free fatty , triglyceride, and cholesterol content. Chrysin exerted antioxidant effects, reduced carbonyl content, advanced glycation end products, collagen, TNF-α, and IL-6 concentrations in the liver. Chrysin significantly reduced the hepatic gene expression of SREBP-1c and increased that of PPAR-α. The histopathology of liver of rats treated with chrysin showed significant decrease in the steatosis, ballooning, and lobular inflammation when compared to the HFD control group. Thus, chrysin demonstrated anti-steatotic, antiglycating, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic effects and seems to be a promising molecule for the management of NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31392628>Alterations of HDL particle phospholipid composition and role of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.</a></h1><p>The increased cardiovascular risk in RA (rheumatoid arthritis) cannot be explained by common quantitative circulating lipid parameters. The objective of the study was to characterize the modifications in HDL phosphosphingolipidome in patients with RA to identify qualitative modifications which could better predict the risk for CVD. Nineteen patients with RA were compared to control subjects paired for age, sex, BMI, and criteria of . The characterization of total HDL phosphosphingolipidome was performed by LC-MS/MS. RA was associated with an increased HDL content of lysophosphatidylcholine and a decreased content of PC (phosphatidylcholine), respectively, positively and negatively associated with cardiovascular risk. A discriminant molecular signature composed of 18 lipids was obtained in the HDL from RA patients. The detailed analysis of phospholipid species showed that molecules carrying omega-3 FA (fatty ), notably docosahexaenoic  (C22:6 n-3), were depleted in HDL isolated from RA patients. By contrast, two PE (phosphatidylethanolamine) species carrying arachidonic  (C20:4 n-6) were increased in HDL from RA patients. Furthermore, disease activity and severity indexes were associated with altered HDL content of 4 PE and 2 PC species. In conclusion, the composition of HDL phosphosphingolipidome is altered during RA. Identification of a lipidomic signature could therefore represent a promising biomarker for CVD risk. Although a causal link remains to be demonstrated, pharmacological and nutritional interventions targeting the normalization of the FA composition of altered phospholipids could help to fight against RA-related inflammation and CVD risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599081>A novel variant in LPL gene is associated with familial combined hyperlipidemia.</a></h1><p>Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) is a common genetic disorder characterized by increased fasted serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B-100. Molecular genetic techniques such as next generation sequencing have been very successful methods for rare variants finding with a moderate-to large effect. In this study, we characterized a large pedigree from MASHAD study in northeast Iran with coinheritance of FCHL and early-onset coronary heart disease. In this family, we used whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing to determine the disease-associated gene. We identified a novel variant in the LPL gene, leading to a substitution of an asparagine for aspartic  at position 151. The D151N substitution cosegregated with these characters in all affected family members in the pedigree but it was absent in all unaffected members in this family. We speculated that the mutation D151N in LPL gene might be associated with FCHL and early-onset coronary heart disease in this family.

Male Paigen diet-fed mice lacking  had significant biliary hyperplasia, increased serum bile  concentration, and increased hepatic pathology. In contrast, female mice were similarly impacted by Paigen diet feeding regardless of  status. Upon Paigen diet challenge, male   mice had altered expression of genes encoding hepatic bile  transporters and cholesterol and fatty  metabolism proteins, including , , , , , and  Untargeted lipidomic profiling in liver tissue revealed 132 lipid species, including sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, and glycerolipids, that differed significantly in abundance depending on  status in male mice.

A fructose tolerance test has been previously developed to evaluate the relative ability of fructose to raise uric  in individuals. However, the effect of fructose to raise uric  in people with diabetes has not been studied.People with type 2 diabetes (n = 143) and without diabetes controls (n = 132) with similar body mass index (BMI) underwent an oral fructose tolerance test. As a comparison, participants also had their uric  levels measured after an oral glucose tolerance test on a different day.Serum uric  was lower in people with type 2 diabetes compared to controls with a similar BMI, especially those with poor glucose control (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] ≥ 8%). Fructose administration raised serum uric  in both groups, with a lower absolute rise in people with diabetes. People with diabetes with a blunted rise in serum uric  had higher baseline serum uric  concentrations and a higher BMI.

Bile flowing from the liver is concentrated in the gallbladder and, in response to a meal, released into the upper intestine. In the intestines, bile  act as detergents and help to emulsify fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. After participating in digestion in the small bowel, bile  are almost completely (95%) reabsorbed in the distal ileum and then retaken up from portal blood by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The primary bile  synthesized in the liver are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  which are typically conjugated to glycine or taurine before secretion. In the intestine, the primary bile  are often converted by colonic bacteria to the secondary bile , predominantly deoxycholic  and lithocholic . The reabsorbed bile  are transported to the liver in portal blood. Conjugated bile  are then retaken up by hepatocytes via the sodium taurocholate cotransporter (NTCT), while unconjugated bile  are taken up by organic anion transporters that also take up bilirubin and other anions. The total bile  pool in humans is tightly controlled by a coordinated regulation of expression of genes involved with synthesis, secretion, reabsorption and reuptake of bile  by the liver. The major components of the bile  pool are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  with lesser amounts deoxycholic and lithocholic  and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic . Bile  also act as signaling molecules and are important in regulation of their own synthesis, uptake and secretion as well as control of cholesterol synthesis and regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. Bile  levels are increased in the serum and liver in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholestasis and, perhaps because of their inherent detergent activities, can cause hepatocyte injury. Thus, increased bile  levels in hepatocytes may account for some of the liver damage in cholestatic liver diseases. Bile  can be used as therapeutic agents, particularly in patients with cholestatic liver diseases where administered bile  (such as ursodeoxycholic ) replace the more lipophilic and toxic bile  that accumulate during cholestasis. Bile  are also useful for the medical treatment (dissolution) of gallstones by increasing bile  and decreasing cholesterol concentrations in bile (causing a less saturated bile). Bile  can also be useful as replacement therapy in patients with bile  synthetic defects. Finally, the other  effects of bile  can be useful in treating  diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Four bile  are currently approved for use in the United States and several others are under active investigation. Cholic  is used for treatment of inherited defects in bile  synthesis, chenodeoxycholic (chenodiol) and ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol)  for gallstone dissolution, and obeticholic and ursodiol for chronic cholestatic liver diseases, specifically primary biliary cirrhosis. Obeticholic  is under evaluation as therapy of other liver diseases including sclerosing cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Ursodiol is used off label to prevent, treat or ameliorate several uncommon forms of liver disease, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, sinusoidal obstruction , graft-vs-host disease, cystic fibrosis associated liver disease, parenteral nutrition related liver injury and even acute, drug induced liver injury. The long term efficacy in ameliorating the course of these diseases is, however, unproven. Separate documents are available in LiverTox for each of the currently available bile .

In our previous trial, a shift in GM structure caused by a complex fiber-rich diet was associated with the health improvement of obese Prader-Willi  (PWS) children. The pre- and post-intervention GMs (pre- and post-group, respectively) from one child were then transplanted into gnotobiotic mice, which resulted in significantly different physiological phenotypes, each of which was similar to the phenotype of the corresponding GM donor. This study was designed to investigate the miRNA-gene regulatory networks involved in causing these phenotypic differences. Using the post-group as a reference, we systematically identified and annotated the differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs and genes in the colon and liver of the pre-group in the second and fourth weeks after GM inoculation. Most of the significantly enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways were observed in the liver and were in the second week after GM transplantation. We screened 23 key genes along with their 73 miRNA regulators relevant to the host phenotype changes and constructed a network. The network contained 92 miRNA-gene regulation relationships, 51 of which were positive, and 41 of which were negative. Both the colon and liver had upregulated pro-inflammatory genes, and genes involved in fatty  oxidation, lipolysis, and plasma cholesterol clearance were downregulated in only the liver. These changes were consistent with lipid and cholesterol accumulation in the host and with a high inflammation level. In addition, the colon showed an impacted glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) signaling pathway, while the liver displayed decreased insulin receptor signaling pathway activity. These molecular changes were mainly found in the second week, 2 weeks before changes in body fat occurred. This time lag indicated that GM dysbiosis might initially induce cholesterol and lipid metabolism-related miRNA and gene expression disorder and then lead to lipid accumulation and obesity development, which implicates a causative role of GM dysbiosis in obesity development rather than a result of obesity. This study provides fundamental molecular information that elucidates how dysbiotic GM increases host inflammation and disturbs host lipid and glucose metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434117>Herd health monitoring in dairy farms - discover  diseases. An overview.</a></h1><p>The transition period, 3 weeks before and 3 weeks after calving, is inevitably accompanied by a negative energy balance, which sometimes causes  disturbances, such as ketosis. Subclinical ketosis (SCK) is defined as an increase in the β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration to ≥ 1.2 mmol/l in the blood. According to a recent study, a value of ≥ 0.7 mmol/l of non-esterified fatty  (NEFA) in the blood indicates the potential development of the poor  adaption  (PMAS). With a herd prevalence of 21 %, and an incidence of approximately 40 % within the first 2 weeks after calving, SCK is a relevant herd health problem. The milk yield decreases in the first 2 weeks postpartum by 3-5.3 kg/d for each ketotic cow, and the total milk reduction through the whole lactation period of 305 days averages 112 kg (SD 89 kg). Although the cow does not display any clinical signs of ketosis at this stage, the risk of developing associated production diseases like retained placenta, metritis, displaced abomasum, lameness and clinical ketosis increases and the expected performance in terms of milk production will decrease. The herd health status deteriorates and the risk for early culling increases. Another impact factor is the financial aspect, which includes costs for early death, reduced milk production, reproduction losses, and associated production diseases. In the literature, the calculated costs per SCK case vary between $ 78 and $ 289. The gold standard diagnostic test for SCK is the photometric measurement of BHB in blood. This method is accurate, but results are delayed due to the required laboratory analysis. There are also some rapid cow-side tests, i. e. urine or milk strip tests available to identify ketotic cows. The common disadvantage of these methods is that they are not suitable for herd health monitoring because of the need to collect samples from each cow manually and the high rates of false negative results. However, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is suitable for herd health monitoring. It is already being used for the analysis of milk composition. This inexpensive, rapid and simple technique has a specificity of 83.8 % and a sensitivity of 82.4 %. Therefore, FTIR is an early and easy method for detecting ketotic cows, that could help reduce financial and performance losses associated with ketosis.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559311>Spontaneous tumor lysis  in T-cell malignancy: two case reports.</a></h1><p>Tumor lysis  (TLS) refers to a constellation of  abnormalities that result from release of intracellular solutes (potassium, phosphate, and nucleic  metabolites) from rapidly dying tumor cells. While TLS most commonly occurs following chemotherapy, spontaneous TLS can rarely occur in rapidly dividing liquid or solid malignancies. Here, we report the cases of two patients who presented with non-specific symptoms and were found to have spontaneous TLS. Work-up in both cases led to a diagnosis of T-cell malignancy (i.e., acute lymphoblastic leukemia and angioimmunoblastic lymphoma). Given that spontaneous TLS can be the first manifestation of an underlying malignancy, all physicians should be familiar with this oncologic emergency.

Additional data collected included height, weight, body mass index, blood test results (C-reactive protein, albumin, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase [γ-GTP], total cholesterol, neutral fat, amylase, urea nitrogen, creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, uric , platelets), the epidural fat-occupying ratio in each vertebra from L1/2 to L5/S1 on MRI, and liver CT values.In 30 cases, the average occupying ratio of epidural fat was ≥40% (SEL), and in 45 cases, liver CT values were <40 HU (fatty liver). Correlation analysis between average occupying ratio of epidural fat and various measurements showed liver CT value (r = -0.574, P <  0.001), body weight (r = 0.304, P =  0.002), γ-GTP (r = 0.370, P =  0.01), and uric  (r = 0.201, P =  0.04) to be independent explanatory factors. Multivariate analysis revealed that SEL was associated with liver CT value (odds ratio 0.774, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.689-0.871) and body weight (odds ratio 1.063, 95% CI 1.016-1.135).There was a strong correlation between epidural fat and liver fat deposits suggesting an association between SEL and systemic fat deposition.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Alteration of the intestinal barrier is associated with enhanced intestinal permeability and development of numerous pathological diseases including gastrointestinal and cardiometabolic diseases. Among the metabolites that play an important role within intestinal health, L Tryptophan (Trp) is one of the nine essential amino  supplied by diet, whose metabolism appears as a key modulator of gut microbiota, with major impacts on physiological, and pathological pathways. Recently, emerging evidence showed that the Trp catabolism through one major enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) expressed by the host affects Trp metabolism by gut microbiota to generate indole metabolites, thereby altering gut function and health in mice and humans. In this mini review, I summarize the most recent advances concerning the role of Trp metabolism in host-microbiota cross-talk in health, and  diseases. This novel aspect of IDO1 function in intestine will better explain its complex roles in a broad range of disease states where the gut function affects local as well as systemic health, and will open new therapeutic strategies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493746>An integrated metabolomics strategy to reveal dose-effect relationship and therapeutic mechanisms of different efficacy of rhubarb in constipation rats.</a></h1><p>The ambiguity of dose-effect relationship of many traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) has always influenced their rational use in TCM clinic. Rhubarb, a preferred representative of cathartic TCM, is currently widely used that results in a diversity of its dosage. The aim of this study was to use an integrated metabolomics strategy to simultaneously reveal dose-effect relationship and therapeutic mechanisms of different efficacy of rhubarb in constipation rats. Six doses of rhubarb (0.135, 0.27, 0.81, 1.35, 4.05, and 8.1 g/kg) were examined to elucidate the laxative and fire-purging effects by pathological sections and UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. The results showed that there existed serious lesions in the stomach and colon of model rats. And conditions were basically improved to some extent in rhubarb-treated groups. Through relative distance calculation based on metabolomics score plots, it suggested that the effective dose threshold (EC-EC range) of rhubarb was from 0.31 to 4.5 g/kg (corresponding to 3.44-50.00 g in the clinic) in rat serum and 0.29-2.1 g/kg (corresponding to 3.22-23.33 g in the clinic) in feces. Then, 33 potential biomarkers were identified in total. Functional pathway analysis revealed that the alterations of these biomarkers were associated with 15  pathways, mainly including arachidonic  metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, primary bile  biosynthesis and sphingolipid metabolism. Of note, different doses of rhubarb could alleviate endogenous disorders to varying degrees through regulating multiple perturbed pathways to the normal state, which might be in a dose-dependent manner and involved in therapeutic mechanisms. To sum up, integrated serum and fecal metabolomics obtained that rhubarb ranging from 0.31 to 2.1 g/kg is safe and effective for constipation treatment. Also, our findings showed that the robust metabolomics techniques would be promising to be more accurately used in the dose-effect studies of complex TCM, and to clarify  pathogenesis and action mechanisms in Chinese medicine.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the expression level and actions of leptin, a vast adipocytokine regulating energy metabolism, appear to be strongly associated with epigenetics. Therefore, the aim of this review was to summarize the current knowledge of the epigenetic regulation of leptin as well as the leptin-induced epigenetic modifications in  disorders and associated phenomena. The collected data indicated that the deregulation of leptin expression and secretion that occurs during the course of  diseases is underlain by a variation in the level of promoter methylation, the occurrence of histone modifications, along with miRNA interference. Furthermore, leptin was proven to epigenetically regulate several miRNAs and affect the activity of the histone deacetylases. These epigenetic modifications were observed in obesity, gestational diabetes,  and concerned various molecular processes like glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, liver fibrosis, obesity-related carcinogenesis, adipogenesis or fetal/early postnatal programming. Moreover, the circulating miRNA profiles were associated with the plasma leptin level in , and miRNAs were found to be involved in hypothalamic leptin sensitivity. In summary, the evidence suggests that leptin is both a target and a mediator of epigenetic changes that develop in numerous tissues during  disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638838>Nutritional factors influencing plasma adiponectin levels: results from a randomised controlled study with whole-grain cereals.</a></h1><p>Data from intervention studies about the effects of a high intake of whole-grain cereals on adiponectin expression are still inconclusive. We evaluated the effects of whole-grain or refined cereals on fasting and postprandial serum adiponectin in people at high cardiovascular risk. According to a randomised controlled parallel group design, participants with  were assigned to an isoenergetic diet based on either whole-grain cereal (WGC) or refined cereal (RC) products for 12-weeks. Anthropometric and biochemical measures were taken. Compared to baseline, fasting and postprandial serum adiponectin levels increased after both RC and WGC. In the WGC and RC groups combined, adiponectin concentrations significantly increased after 12-week intervention, and are directly associated with plasma SCFAs and acetate. Only increasing whole-grain cereals may not influence adiponectin levels, which could be modified by a fibre rich, low-fat, low-glycemic index diet, possibly through changes in gut microbiota, as suggested by the relation with SCFAs.

Here, the plasma  phenotype of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n = 167), idiopathic-developmental delay (i-DD, n = 51), and Down  (DS, n = 31), as compared to typically developed (TD, n = 193) controls was investigated in a subset of children from the case-control Childhood Autism Risk from Genetics and the Environment (CHARGE) Study. Metabolome profiles were obtained using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and analyzed in an untargeted manner. Forty-nine metabolites were identified and quantified in each sample that included amino , organic , sugars, and other compounds. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed significant associations between 11 plasma metabolites and neurodevelopmental outcome. Despite the varied origins of these developmental disabilities, we observed similar perturbation in one-carbon metabolism pathways among DS and ASD cases. Similarities were also observed in the DS and i-DD cases in the energy-related tricarboxylic  cycle. Other metabolites and pathways were uniquely associated with DS or ASD. By comparing  signatures between these conditions, the current study expands on extant literature demonstrating  alterations associated with developmental disabilities and provides a better understanding of overlapping vs specific biological perturbations associated with these disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581549>Exogenous Ketones Lower Blood Glucose Level in Rested and Exercised Rodent Models.</a></h1><p>Diseases involving inflammation and oxidative stress can be exacerbated by high blood glucose levels. Due to tight  regulation, safely reducing blood glucose can prove difficult. The ketogenic diet (KD) reduces absolute glucose and insulin, while increasing fatty  oxidation, ketogenesis, and circulating levels of β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB), acetoacetate (AcAc), and acetone. Compliance to KD can be difficult, so alternative therapies that help reduce glucose levels are needed. Exogenous ketones provide an alternative method to elevate blood ketone levels without strict dietary requirements. In this study, we tested the changes in blood glucose and ketone (βHB) levels in response to acute, sub-chronic, and chronic administration of various ketogenic compounds in either a post-exercise or rested state. WAG/Rij (WR) rats, a rodent model of human absence epilepsy, GLUT1 deficiency  mice (GLUT1D), and wild type Sprague Dawley rats (SPD) were assessed. Non-pathological animals were also assessed across different age ranges. Experimental groups included KD, standard diet (SD) supplemented with water (Control, C) or with exogenous ketones: 1, 3-butanediol (BD), βHB mineral salt (KS), KS with medium chain triglyceride/MCT (KSMCT), BD acetoacetate diester (KE), KE with MCT (KEMCT), and KE with KS (KEKS). In rested WR rats, the KE, KS, KSMCT groups had lower blood glucose level after 1 h of treatment, and in KE and KSMCT groups after 24 h. After exercise, the KE, KSMCT, KEKS, and KEMCT groups had lowered glucose levels after 1 h, and in the KEKS and KEMCT groups after 7 days, compared to control. In GLUT1D mice without exercise, only KE resulted in significantly lower glucose levels at week 2 and week 6 during a 10 weeks long chronic feeding study. In 4-month and 1-year-old SPD rats in the post-exercise trials, blood glucose was significantly lower in KD and KE, and in KEMCT groups, respectively. After seven days, the KSMCT group had the most significantly reduced blood glucose levels, compared to control. These results indicate that exogenous ketones were efficacious in reducing blood glucose levels within and outside the context of exercise in various rodent models of different ages, with and without pathology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31366638>What is the most important determinant of cardiometabolic risk in 60-65-year-old subjects: physical activity-related behaviours, overall energy expenditure or occupational status?

The subjects were tested for major cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, anthropometric indices, blood pressure, lipid levels, glucose, uric  and homocysteine. PA-EE and PA-HRB were assessed with PA questionnaires.Blue-collar workers displayed higher anthropometric indices, blood pressure and higher PA-EE in comparison with other two groups. PA-HRB had a positive impact on body mass indices, lipids, glucose, uric  and the prevalence of , with no such relationship observed for PA-EE.The greatest cardiovascular risk was observed in the blue-collar workers group. Only PA-HRB had a positive association with cardiometabolic risk profile. No relationship was observed for PA-EE. Thus, promoting everyday life and leisure time PA behaviours is crucial for preventing cardiometabolic risk in pre-elderly subjects, even in blue-collar workers with high work-related EE.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

This condition is accompanied by an extensive series of relatively serious neuropsychiatric symptoms. The diagnosis of PANS is made by "exclusion", as the individual PANS symptoms overlap with a multiplicity of psychiatric disorders with onset in childhood. Several researchers accumulated evidence to support the hypothesis that PANS was closely associated with a variety of infections. In the last decade, metabolomics played an essential role in improving the knowledge of complex biological systems and identifying potential new biomarkers, as indicators of pathological progressions, or pharmacologic responses to therapy. The metabolome is considered the most predictive phenotype, capable to catch epigenetic differences, reflecting more closely the clinical reality at any given moment and thus providing extremely dynamic data. In the present work, we review the most recent hypothesis and suggested mechanisms of this condition and describe the case of a 10 year -year-old girl with PANS, before and after clarithromycin treatment. The main results of this case report are discussed from a metabolomics point of view. The alteration of several  pathways concerning the microbial activity highlights the possible role of the microbiome in the development of PANS. Furthermore, different  perturbations at the level of the protein biosynthesis, energy and amino  metabolisms were observed and discussed. Based on our observations, we believe that metabolomics is a promising technology to unravel the mysteries of PANS in the near future.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31455269>Whole exome sequencing reveals two novel compound heterozygous mutations in TWNK as a cause of the hepatocerebral form of mitochondrial DNA depletion : a case report.</a></h1><p>Although Mitochondrial DNA depletion  (MDS) can be classified into three forms: myopathic, encephalomyopathic and hepatocerebral form, it is difficult to identify its form due to its clinical heterogeneity. Therefore, it is very important to conduct molecular genetic analysis on suspected patients.

He was onset of mild jaundice with leukodystrophy and high lactate and phenylderivatives for urine organic  on the 7th day. Whole exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing were performed to screen and confirm the suspicious pathogenic mutations. The results revealed this proband carried two compound heterozygous mutations in TWNK: c.1186 C > T / p.Pro396Ser and c.1844 G > C / p.Gly615Ala inherited by an autosomal recessive form from his parents, of which protein conservative analysis and structural modeling supported the pathogenicity of the two mutations. Unfortunately, the conditions described above were not improved until he was discharged from the hospital on the 23rd day and died at 4 months of age.In this study, we investigated a Chinese family with the hepatocerebral form of MDS and conducted WES and Sanger sequencing to explore the causative mutations for this proband born from non-consanguineous and healthy parents. We identified two novel TWNK c.1186 C > T/ c.1844 G > C compound heterozygous mutations which were probably the disease-causing mutations of hepatocerebral form of MDS and described the clinical manifestations of the proband, which expanded the phenotypic spectrum of MDS caused by variants in TWNK.

Various lifestyle factors, especially changes in dietary habits, extreme temperatures, unusual light-dark cycles, substance abuse, and other stressful factors, are also established modifiers of the endocannabinoid system and its extended version, the endocannabinoidome. The endocannabinoidome is a complex lipid signaling system composed of a plethora (>100) of fatty -derived mediators and their receptors and anabolic and catabolic enzymes (>50 proteins) which are deeply involved in the control of energy metabolism and its pathological deviations. A strong link between the endocannabinoidome and another major player in metabolism and dysmetabolism, the gut microbiome, is also emerging. Here, we review several examples of how lifestyle modifications (westernized diets, lack or presence of certain nutritional factors, physical exercise, and the use of cannabis) can modulate the propensity to develop  by modifying the crosstalk between the endocannabinoidome and the gut microbiome and, hence, how lifestyle interventions can provide new therapies against cardiometabolic risk by ensuring correct functioning of both these systems.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664805>The Role of Lipids in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fastest growing cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with few treatment options and a 70% recurrence rate. This trend is driven largely by the recent surge in incidence of , non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Given the central role of the liver in lipid homeostasis, altered hepatic lipid metabolism has been identified as a contributing factor to hepatocellular carcinoma. Neoplastic cells are highly dependent on lipid metabolism as a source of energy and to support rapid cell division, and fatty  derivatives play key roles in cell signaling. Aberrant expression of liver fatty –binding protein and changes in the ratio of saturated to unsaturated triacylglycerols have been shown to be associated with disease severity and subtype.

Several medicinal plants, including spices, are used in Cameroon as herbal medicines and are traditionally employed for the treatment of several ailments such as diabetes and related diseases. In this study, we chemically characterized eleven Cameroonian spice extracts and evaluated their effects on some enzyme activities relevant to carbohydrate and lipid digestion and cardio- diseases. Hydroethanolic spice extracts were characterized by GC-MS analysis and screened for their ability to modulate the activity of α-glucosidase, α-amylase, pancreatic lipase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Among the spice extracts tested, those from Xylopia parviflora showed the widest inhibitory spectrum, with a relevant effect on all enzyme activities. Dichrostachys glomerata and Aframomum citratum extracts were more selective. The selected and strong activity of some plants, such as that of Aframomum citratum on pancreatic lipase and that of Xylopia aethiopica on ACE, suggests their specific use in obesity and hypertension, respectively. Chemical analysis indicated that for some spice extracts such as Xylopia parviflora and Aframomum citratum their secondary metabolites (chlorogenic , pimaric , and catechin and its derivatives) could potentially justify the biological properties observed.

This research aimed to systematically review the effects of OA on the main components of MetS as well as oxidative stress in clinical trials and experimental animal studies. Databases searched included PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane, and CINAHL from 2013 to 2019. Thus, both animal studies ( = 23) and human clinical trials ( = 1) were included in our review to assess the effects of OA formulations on parameters concerning insulin resistance and the MetS components. The methodological quality assessment was performed through using the SYRCLE's Risk of Bias for animal studies and the Jadad scale. According to the studies in our review, OA improves blood pressure levels, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance. Although there is scientific evidence that OA has beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of MetS and insulin resistance, more experimental studies and randomized clinical trials are needed to guarantee its effectiveness.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604922>TFPa/HADHA is required for fatty  beta-oxidation and cardiolipin re-modeling in human cardiomyocytes.</a></h1><p>Mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency, due to mutations in hydratase subunit A (HADHA), results in sudden infant death  with no cure. To reveal the disease etiology, we generated stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes from HADHA-deficient hiPSCs and accelerated their maturation via an engineered microRNA maturation cocktail that upregulated the epigenetic regulator, HOPX.  Here we report, matured HADHA mutant cardiomyocytes treated with an endogenous mixture of fatty  manifest the disease phenotype: defective calcium dynamics and repolarization kinetics which results in a pro-arrhythmic state. Single cell RNA-seq reveals a cardiomyocyte developmental intermediate, based on  gene expression. This intermediate gives rise to mature-like cardiomyocytes in control cells but, mutant cells transition to a pathological state with reduced fatty  beta-oxidation, reduced mitochondrial proton gradient, disrupted cristae structure and defective cardiolipin remodeling. This study reveals that HADHA (tri-functional protein alpha), a monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase-like enzyme, is required for fatty  beta-oxidation and cardiolipin remodeling, essential for functional mitochondria in human cardiomyocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31426291>Antioxidant Versus Pro-Apoptotic Effects of Mushroom-Enriched Diets on Mitochondria in Liver Disease.</a></h1><p>Mitochondria play a central role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression and in the control of cell death signalling during the progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Associated with the , NAFLD is mostly driven by insulin-resistant white adipose tissue lipolysis that results in an increased hepatic fatty  influx and the ectopic accumulation of fat in the liver. Upregulation of beta-oxidation as one compensatory mechanism leads to an increase in mitochondrial tricarboxylic  cycle flux and ATP generation. The progression of NAFLD is associated with alterations in the mitochondrial molecular composition and respiratory capacity, which increases their vulnerability to different stressors, including calcium and pro-inflammatory molecules, which result in an increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that, altogether, may ultimately lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. This may activate further pro-inflammatory pathways involved in the progression from steatosis to steatohepatitis (NASH). Mushroom-enriched diets, or the administration of their isolated bioactive compounds, have been shown to display beneficial effects on insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation by regulating nutrient uptake and lipid metabolism as well as modulating the antioxidant activity of the cell. In addition, the gut microbiota has also been described to be modulated by mushroom bioactive molecules, with implications in reducing liver inflammation during NAFLD progression. Dietary mushroom extracts have been reported to have anti-tumorigenic properties and to induce cell-death via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. This calls for particular attention to the potential therapeutic properties of these natural compounds which may push the development of novel pharmacological options to treat NASH and HCC. We here review the diverse effects of mushroom-enriched diets in liver disease, emphasizing those effects that are dependent on mitochondria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336554>Association of body mass index with serum calcium and phosphate levels.</a></h1><p>It has been shown that several environmental and physiological factors can affect on the serum levels of calcium and phosphate. The objective of the present study was explored the relationship between serum calcium and phosphate levels with anthropometric and hematological markers.908 subjects were recruited from the Mashhad stroke and heart atherosclerosis disorder (MASHHAD) program. Anthropometric parameters, liver/kidney function tests (e.g., Urea nitrogen, creatinine, urea and uric , creatinine, AST, ALT) were determined in all participants. Serum concentrations of calcium and phosphate were measured using Autoanalyzer BT3000P (Pars Azmoon kit, Tehran, Iran). SPSS software was used for statistical analyses.We observed that obese subjects had a lower level of serum calcium (p˂0.05). Moreover, a relationship was detected between serum phosphate level and different menopausal status (p˂0.05). Serum calcium and phosphate did not change by increasing age in the population. Additionally, there was a correlation between lymphocyte count with serum phosphate level (p˂0.05). No statistically different were detected for the levels of calcium/phosphate with respect to smoking status, physical activity, lipid profile, liver and renal function markers.We found an association between serum calcium and BMI as well as with serum phosphate and menopausal status.Copyright © 2019 Diabetes India.

Oxidative stress is an important component of cardio- risk seen in PCOS.A total of 95 women with PCOS and 95 healthy controls were included in this observational study. Serum PON1 activity and stress markers were measured by spectrophotometric methods. Circulating TF level was measured by ELISA.We found decreased PON1 activity and increased TF levels in women with PCOS compared to healthy controls. Fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, testosterone, LDL-C, MDA, PC and SOD activity were significantly increased whereas FGIR, QUICKI, HDLC, CAT and TAC were significantly decreased in PCOS women than controls. We observed a positive association of PON1 activity with FGIR, QUICKI, HDL-C and TAC, and its negative association was observed with LH, testosterone, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR in PCOS women. We further observed a positive association of TF with waist, waist to hip ratio, BMI, glucose 1hr, cholesterol, LDL-C, SGPT, uric  and SOD activity in PCOS women.Decreased PON1 activity and raised circulating TF levels are respective indicators of pro-inflammatory and procoagulant status in PCOS women. The imbalanced oxidant/antioxidant status further supports the evidences that PCOS is an oxidant state. Further, the association of PON1 activity and TF levels with the clinical, laboratory findings and stress marker levels suggest that these factors taken together are involved in aggravating the pro-inflammatory status in PCOS women.Copyright © 2019 Diabetes India.

Secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively neutralizes interleukin-17A (IL-17A), has shown significant and sustained efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis.This was an exploratory post hoc analysis of pooled data from three phase 3 studies in plaque psoriasis patient populations. The objective was to show the course of  and liver parameters under secukinumab, etanercept, or placebo treatment over time. A further objective was to assess the impact of selected comorbidities and  characteristics on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), as a surrogate marker of systemic inflammation.Data from the phase 3 randomised controlled trials (FIXTURE [], ERASURE [], and SCULPTURE []; n=3010) were included in this analysis. Patients were treated with secukinumab 150 mg or 300 mg, placebo or etanercept 50 mg (FIXTURE only) as active comparator. A set of  and liver parameters was longitudinally assessed over 52 weeks. Multivariate regression analyses assessed the impact of selected comorbidities and  characteristics on hs-CRP levels at baseline and under treatment.Secukinumab treatment reduced hs-CRP levels. Body weight and uric  levels tended to decrease over 52 weeks with secukinumab. Secukinumab showed a neutral effect on fasting plasma glucose, lipid parameters and liver enzymes. Psoriatic arthritis, , obesity, impaired glucose metabolism, and hyperuricemia were each associated with increased hs-CRP levels at baseline. Concomitant obesity attenuated the decline in hs-CRP under treatment.These analyses suggest neutral to favourable long term trends in  and liver parameters under secukinumab treatment.  comorbidities were associated with increased hs-CRP levels, reflecting the role of systemic inflammatory processes in their pathophysiology.© 2019 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614852>Grape Seeds Proanthocyanidins: An Overview of In Vivo Bioactivity in Animal Models.</a></h1><p>Over the last decade, proanthocyanidins (PACs) are attracting attention not only from the food industry but also from public health organizations due to their health benefits. It is well-known that grapes are a good source of PACs and for that reason, the industry is also focused on grape by-products identification and bioactivity evaluation. Grape seeds extract (GSPE) is a rich source of PACs, mainly composed of monomeric catechin and epicatechin, gallic  and polymeric and oligomeric proanthocyanidins. Thus, this review encompasses the state-of-art structure and the most recent evidence about the impact of GSPE on chronic diseases, with a focus on oxidative stress, inflammation and  (MeS)-related disorders such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular risk disease in vivo to offer new perspectives in the field that allow further research. Despite the controversial results, is undeniable that PACs from grape seeds are highly antioxidants, thus, the capacity of GSPE to improve oxidative stress might mediate the inflammation process and the progress of MeS-related pathologies. However, further well-design animal studies with standardized dosages and GSPE composition are necessary to shed light into the cause-effect relationship in a more accurate way to later allow a deeper study of the effect of GSPE in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617618>Immunoreactive insulin stability in horses at risk of insulin dysregulation.</a></h1><p>Diseases associated with insulin dysregulation (ID), such as equine  and pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction, are of interest to practitioners because of their association with laminitis. Accurate insulin concentration assessment is critical in diagnosing and managing these diseases.To determine the effect of time, temperature, and collection tube type on insulin concentrations in horses at risk of ID.Eight adult horses with body condition score >6/9.In this prospective study, subjects underwent an infeed oral glucose test 2 hours before blood collection. Blood samples were divided into ethylenediaminetetraacetic , heparinized, or serum tubes and stored at 4 or 20°C. Tubes were centrifuged and analyzed for insulin by a chemiluminescent assay over 8 days. Changes in insulin concentrations were compared with a linear mixed effects model.An overall effect of time, tube type and temperature was identified (P = .01, P = 0.001, and P = 0.001, respectively). Serum and heparinized samples had similar concentrations for 3 days at 20°C and 8 days at 4°C; however, after 3 days at 20°C, heparinized samples had significantly higher insulin concentrations (P = .004, P = .03, and P = .03 on consecutive days). Ethylenediaminetetraacetic  samples had significantly lower insulin concentrations regardless of time and temperature (P = .001 for all comparisons).These results suggest an ideal protocol to determine insulin concentrations involves using serum or heparinized samples with analysis occurring within 3 days at 20°C or 8 days at 4°C.© 2019 The Authors.

A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. As insulin resistance is closely associated with , this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body insulin sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting fatty- β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31556363>The effects of dietary fatty  in the physiological outcomes of maternal high-fat diet on offspring energy homeostasis in mice.</a></h1><p>The early-life origins of disease hypothesis has been applied to obesity research and modeled through overnutrition, usually with a high-fat diet (HFD). Since the obesity epidemic coincided with societal change in dietary fat consumption, rather than amount, manipulation of fatty  (FA) profile is an under-investigated area of study. Additionally, the binding of FAs to nuclear receptors may have persistent intergenerational, extranutritive endocrinological effects that interact with the actions of reproductive steroids causing sex-dependent effects. To determine the role of FA type in the effects underlying maternal HFD, we fed wild-type C57BL6/J mating pairs, from preconception through lactation, a HFD with high saturated fat levels from coconut oil or high linoleic  (LA) levels from vegetable oil. Male and female offspring body weight and food intake were measured weekly for 25 weeks. Assays for glucose metabolism, body composition, and calorimetry were performed at 25 weeks. Plasma  peptides and liver mRNA were measured terminally. Obesity was primarily affected by adult rather than maternal diet in males, yet in females, maternal HFD potentiated the effects of adult HFD. Maternal HFD high in LA impaired glucose disposal in males weaned onto HFD and insulin sensitivity of females. Plasma leptin correlated with adiposity, but insulin and insulin receptor expression in the liver were altered by maternal LA in males. Our results suggest that maternal FA profile is most influential on offspring glucose metabolism and that adult diet is more important than maternal diet for obesity and other parameters of .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494022>Sphingolipid dyshomeostasis in the brain of the mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA.</a></h1><p>Gangliosides are complex glycosphingolipids that are vital for proper brain development and function. Alterations in ganglioside metabolism are evident in neurological disorders including the inherited  disease mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA/Sanfilippo A ). Here we sought to comprehensively analyse alterations in ganglioside metabolism within the brain of a naturally occurring MPS IIIA mouse model at early (one month) and late (six months of age) stages of disease progression, as well as the impact on related sphingolipids in the ganglioside  pathway. The simple gangliosides G and G were elevated in the brain stem, cerebellum and sub-cortex of the MPS IIIA mouse at one month of age, but not in the cortex. By six months accumulation was significant throughout the brain, with G gangliosides also elevated. Elevations in other sphingolipids were limited to the upstream synthetic precursors, ceramide and dihexosylceramide (DHC) species containing 18:0 and 20:0 acyl chains, likely due to the abundance of these fatty  in the elevated gangliosides. In contrast, sphingomyelin, sulphatide and DHC containing a 24:1 fatty , were all decreased in the brain stem of the MPS IIIA mice, suggestive of alterations in myelination. These perturbations in sphingolipid metabolism could provide an avenue for therapeutic intervention by manipulation with specific drugs that target the production of these lipids.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The virus can be separated into etiologies that contain multiple heterologous low and highly pathogenic strains. Recently, the United States has begun to see an increase in heterologous type 2 PRRSV strains of higher virulence (HP-PRRSV). The high pathogenicity of these strains can drastically alter host immune responses and the ability of the animal to maintain homeostasis. Because the loss of host homeostasis can denote underlying changes in gene and regulatory element expression profiles, the study aimed to examine the effect PRRSV infections has on miRNA and tRNA expression and the roles they play in host tolerance or susceptibility.  Using transcriptomic analysis of whole blood taken from control and infected pigs at several time points (1, 3, 8 dpi), the analysis returned a total of 149 statistically significant (FDR ⫹ 0.15) miRNAs (n = 89) and tRNAs (n = 60) that were evaluated for possible pro- and anti-viral effects. The tRNA differential expression increased in both magnitude and count as dpi increased, with no statistically significant expression at 1 dpi, but increases at 3 and 8 dpi. The most abundant tRNA amino  at 3 dpi was alanine, while glycine was the most abundant at 8 dpi. For the miRNAs, focus was put on upregulation that can inhibit gene expression. These results yielded candidates with potential anti- and pro-viral actions such as Ssc-miR-125b, which is predicted to limit PRRSV viral levels, and Ssc-miR-145-5p shown to cause alternative macrophage priming. The results also showed that both the tRNAs and miRNAs displayed expression patterns.  The results indicated that the HP-PRRSV infection affects host homeostasis through changes in miRNA and tRNA expression and their subsequent gene interactions that target and influence the function of host immune, , and structural pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451009>Improvement of Lipoprotein Profile and  Endotoxemia by a Lifestyle Intervention That Modifies the Gut Microbiota in Subjects With .</a></h1><p>Background  (MetS) is a serious health problem over the world; thus, the aim of the present work was to develop a lifestyle intervention to decrease the dysbiosis of gut microbiota and reduce the biochemical abnormalities of MetS. Methods and Results The prevalence of MetS was evaluated in 1065 subjects of Mexico City, Mexico, and the gut microbiota in a subsample. Subjects with MetS were selected for a pragmatic study based on a lifestyle intervention with a low-saturated-fat diet, reduced-energy intake, with functional foods and physical activity, and a second group was selected for a randomized control-placebo study to assess the gut microbiota after the dietary intervention. Prevalence of MetS was 53%, and the higher the body mass index, the higher the gut microbiota dysbiosis. The higher the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance, the lower the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. The pragmatic study revealed that after 15 days on a low-saturated-fat diet, there was a 24% reduction in serum triglycerides; and after a 75-day lifestyle intervention, MetS was reduced by 44.8%, with a reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, small low-density lipoprotein particles, glucose intolerance, lipopolysaccharide, and branched-chain amino . The randomized control-placebo study showed that after the lifestyle intervention, there was a decrease in the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota associated with a reduction in the Prevotella/ Bacteroides ratio and an increase in the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Conclusions A lifestyle intervention significantly decreased MetS components, small low-density lipoprotein particle concentration, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and  endotoxemia, reducing the risk of atherosclerosis.

While studies of animals that became extinct can be informative, it is the survivors that provide clues for mechanisms of adaptation when conditions are adverse. Here, we describe a survival pathway used by many species as a means for providing adequate fuel and water, while also providing protection from a decrease in oxygen availability. Fructose, whether supplied in the diet (primarily fruits and honey), or endogenously (via activation of the polyol pathway), preferentially shifts the organism towards the storing of fuel (fat, glycogen) that can be used to provide energy and water at a later date. Fructose causes sodium retention and raises blood pressure and likely helped survival in the setting of dehydration or salt deprivation. By shifting energy production from the mitochondria to glycolysis, fructose reduced oxygen demands to aid survival in situations where oxygen availability is low. The actions of fructose are driven in part by vasopressin and the generation of uric . Twice in history, mutations occurred during periods of mass extinction that enhanced the activity of fructose to generate fat, with the first being a mutation in vitamin C metabolism during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (65 million years ago) and the second being a mutation in uricase that occurred during the Middle Miocene disruption (12-14 million years ago). Today, the excessive intake of fructose due to the availability of refined sugar and high-fructose corn syrup is driving 'burden of life style' diseases, including obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure.© 2019 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31489674>Dietary chia seeds (Salvia hispanica) improve acute dyslipidemia and steatohepatitis in rats.</a></h1><p>Chia seeds (Salvia hispanica L.) are rich in omega fatty . Dyslipidemia and steatohepatitis are diseases that require effective treatments in obese and non-obese patients. The aim was to evaluate the effect of chia intake on acute tyloxapol (TI)-induced dyslipidemia, on acute carbon tetrachloride (TC)-induced steatohepatitis, and on mixed damage (TC+TI) in non-obese rats. Four experimental groups were fed for 4 weeks a diet with established rodent food (DE), and four groups were fed a diet with 15% added chia (DC). Plasma samples were analyzed for total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, biochemical liver damage markers, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Liver samples were used to quantify glycogen, catalase, lipid peroxidation, and TNF-α. A histopathological analysis was performed. DC intake partially or totally prevented steatohepatitis, and reduced lipids in the dyslipidemic groups. The hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective effects of chia may be correlated to its high content of α-linolenic  (omega-3) and phenolics. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:  is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which are currently the most common causes of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. Dyslipidemia is a significant risk factor for NAFLD and NASH. Non-obese patients may have NAFLD or NASH.  and dyslipidemia are more strongly associated with NAFLD in non-obese than in obese patients. This is the first study evaluating the hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective effects of chia seed intake on acute dyslipidemia and/or steatohepatitis caused by the individual or combined administration of the inducers tyloxapol and carbon tetrachloride, respectively, in non-obese rats. The pharmacological effects of dietary chia are correlated to its high content of omega-3 and omega-6 (1:1), protein, dietary fiber, and phenolics. The results suggest that inclusion of chia in diets of non-obese patients with dyslipidemia and/or NAFLD/NASH may improve their health state and preventing cirrhosis or HCC.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31405672>Effect of Omega-3 and vitamin E co-supplementation on serum lipids concentrations in overweight patients with  disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</a></h1><p>Results of the studies assessed the effect of omega-3 and vitamin E co-supplementation on lipid profile in patients with  (MS) are contradictory.

We thus generated fatty -binding protein 4 (Fabp4)-GDF5 transgenic (TG) mice and showed that GDF5 TG mice developed a relative lean phenotype on a high-fat diet (HFD) and showed increased insulin sensitivity. Over expression of GDF5 in adipose tissues greatly promoted the thermogenic process in sWAT after cold or β3-agonist treatment. In TG mice, sWAT showed an important thermogenic effect as the thermogenic gene expression was markedly increased, which was consistent with the typical features of beige adipocytes. Moreover, knockdown of the protein GDF5 impaired browning program in sWAT after thermogenic stimuli. Enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) signaling was also identified in sWAT of HFD-fed GDF5 mice, and thermogenesis in mature adipocytes induced by GDF5 protein could be partly blocked by a p38 MAPK inhibitor. Taken together, our data suggest that GDF5 could improve insulin sensitivity and prevent , the adaptive thermogenesis in sWAT could mediate the obesity resistance effects of GDF5 in mice and partially resulted in the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474470>Metabolomics study on the therapeutic effect of traditional Chinese medicine Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu decoction in coronary heart disease based on LC-Q-TOF/MS and GC-MS analysis.</a></h1><p>The present study aims is to investigate the  mechanism of Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu decoction (XFZYD) in the treatment of blood-stasis  in Coronary Heart Disease (CHD).

Recent studies have shown that plasma level of SHBG is related to some components of  (MetS); however, in contrast, few articles failed to show any associations between SHBG and MetS. So, this study was conducted to investigate the relationship between Components of  and Plasma Level of Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin. In this study, after measuring the plasma level of SHBG in 84 individuals, the relation between MetS and the plasma level of SHBG was investigated. After evaluating the plasma level of SHBG and  abnormalities in men and women, we investigated the factors which mentioned above in two groups including patients with and without MetS. Also, the  abnormalities which evaluated in this study including plasma level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, serum uric  (SUA), Albumin, lipid profiles and etc. according to five components of MetS. Our result shows that SHBG could contributed to some laboratory parameters such as LDL-C (P<0.05), total cholesterol (P<0.05), triglycerides (P<0.05) and etc. in men, but not in women. On the other hand, we observed that concentration of SHBG is higher in patients with MetS (P<0.05); however, results from our experiment showed that there is no relation between lower level of SHBG and five components of MetS such as central obesity, raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (P>0.05), reduced HDL-C (P>0.05), raised triglycerides (P>0.05) and raised blood pressure (P>0.05) in both men and women.

It is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane. CI oxidizes NADH generated from the tricarboxylic  cycle to NAD, in a series of redox reactions that culminates in the reduction of ubiquinone, and the transport of protons from the matrix across the inner membrane to the intermembrane space. The resulting proton-motive force is consumed by ATP synthase to generate ATP, or harnessed to transport ions, metabolites and proteins into the mitochondrion. CI is also a major source of reactive oxygen species. Accordingly, impaired CI function has been associated with a host of chronic  and degenerative disorders such as diabetes, cardiomyopathy, Parkinson's disease (PD) and Leigh . Studies on Drosophila have contributed to our understanding of the multiple roles of CI in bioenergetics and organismal physiology.

Testosterone treatment of hypogonadal patients decrease fat mass, increase lean body mass and improve insulin sensitivity, but whether this extend to patients with KS is presently unknown.In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, BMI-matched cross-over study, 13 males with KS (age: 34.8 yrs); BMI: 26.7 kg/m2) received testosterone (Andriol®) 160 mg per day (T) or placebo treatment for 6 months. Thirteen age and BMI-matched healthy controls were recruited. DEXA scan, abdominal CT scan and a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, muscle strength and maximal oxygen uptake measurement were performed.Total lean body mass and body fat mass were comparable between testosterone naïve KS and controls using DEXA, whereas visceral fat mass, total abdominal and intra-abdominal fat by CT was increased (P<0.05). Testosterone decreased total body fat (P=0.01) and abdominal fat by CT (P=0.04). Glucose disposal was similar between testosterone naïve KS and controls (P=0.3), and unchanged during T (P=0.8). Free fatty  suppression during the clamp was impaired in KS and maximal oxygen uptake was markedly lower in KS, but both were unaffected by treatment. T increased hemoglobin and IGF-I.Testosterone treatment in adult males with KS for 6 month leads to favorable changes in body composition with reductions in fat mass, including abdominal fat mass, but does not change measures of glucose homeostasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31390801>A Dietary Intervention of Bioactive Enriched Foods Aimed at Adults at Risk of : Protocol and Results from PATHWAY-27 Pilot Study.</a></h1><p>Around a quarter of the global adult population have  (MetS) and therefore increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and diabetes. Docosahexaenoic , oat beta-glucan and grape anthocyanins have been shown to be effective in reducing MetS risk factors when administered as isolated compounds, but their effect when administered as bioactive-enriched foods has not been evaluated.The overall aim of the PATHWAY-27 project was to evaluate the effectiveness of bioactive-enriched food consumption on improving risk factors of MetS. A pilot study was conducted to assess which of five bioactive combinations provided within three different food matrices (bakery, dairy or egg) were the most effective in adult volunteers. The trial also evaluated the feasibility of production, consumer acceptability and gastrointestinal tolerance of the bioactive-enriched food.The study included three monocentric, parallel-arm, double-blind, randomised, dietary intervention trials without a placebo. Each recruiting centre tested the five bioactive combinations within a single food matrix.The study was completed by 167 participants (74 male, 93 female). The results indicated that specific bioactive/matrix combinations have effects on serum triglyceride or HDL-cholesterol level without adverse effects.The study evidenced that bioactive-enriched food offers a promising food-based strategy for MetS prevention, and highlighted the importance of conducting pilot studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551786> Profiling Analysis of Patients With Coronary Heart Disease Undergoing Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction Treatment.</a></h1><p>Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is one of the effective complementary and alternative therapies used to improve the prognosis of CHD patients. Xuefu Zhuyu (XFZY) decoction, a classical traditional Chinese medication for regulating Qi and promoting blood circulation, has a clinical benefit in CHD; however, the underlying mechanism is not clear. Recently, it was found that the metabolites involved in amino  metabolism and the tricarboxylic  cycle were altered in CHD patients with Qi and Yin deficiency . To understand the material foundation of Qi, it is of great significance to study the differential metabolites involved in Qi during treatment of CHD with Qi-regulating and blood-promoting herbs. In this study, we investigated the  profiles of serum in CHD patients by nontargeted metabolomics analysis to detect differential metabolites between the XFZY decoction group and placebo group. Ten CHD patients were enrolled and treated with placebo granules or XFZY decoction granules in a random and double-blind manner. Serum samples of all patients were evaluated by untargeted high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. In total, 513 metabolites were detected in the serum of CHD patients, and six of these metabolites participating in seven  pathways were significantly different between CHD patients treated with XFZY decoction and the placebo group. Among the six differential metabolites, FA (20:2)-H and tetracarboxylic  (24:0), involved in fatty  metabolism; cis-aconitic , which participates in the tricarboxylic  cycle; 2-deoxy-D-glucose, involved in glucose metabolism; and N-acetylglycine, involved in amino  metabolism, were decreased, whereas spermine, which participates in amino  metabolism, was increased as compared with the placebo group. Our findings, combined with the perspective of biological functions, indicate that 2-deoxy-D-glucose and spermine might constitute the partial material foundation of Qi in CHD patients treated with XFZY decoction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374204>Bi-allelic TARS Mutations Are Associated with Brittle Hair Phenotype.</a></h1><p>Brittle and "tiger-tail" hair is the diagnostic hallmark of trichothiodystrophy (TTD), a rare recessive disease associated with a wide spectrum of clinical features including ichthyosis, intellectual disability, decreased fertility, and short stature. As a result of premature abrogation of terminal differentiation, the hair is brittle and fragile and contains reduced cysteine content. Hypersensitivity to UV light is found in about half of individuals with TTD; all of these individuals harbor bi-allelic mutations in components of the basal transcription factor TFIIH, and these mutations lead to impaired nucleotide excision repair and basal transcription. Different genes have been found to be associated with non-photosensitive TTD (NPS-TTD); these include MPLKIP (also called TTDN1), GTF2E2 (also called TFIIEβ), and RNF113A. However, a relatively large group of these individuals with NPS-TTD have remained genetically uncharacterized. Here we present the identification of an NPS-TTD-associated gene, threonyl-tRNA synthetase (TARS), found by next-generation sequencing of a group of uncharacterized individuals with NPS-TTD. One individual has compound heterozygous TARS variants, c.826A>G (p.Lys276Glu) and c.1912C>T (p.Arg638), whereas a second individual is homozygous for the TARS variant: c.680T>C (p.Leu227Pro). We showed that these variants have a profound effect on TARS protein stability and enzymatic function. Our results expand the spectrum of genes involved in TTD to include genes implicated in amino  charging of tRNA, which is required for the last step in gene expression, namely protein translation. We previously proposed that some of the TTD-specific features derive from subtle transcription defects as a consequence of unstable transcription factors. We now extend the definition of TTD from a transcription  to a "gene-expression" .Copyright © 2019 American Society of Human Genetics. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This can lead to hyperinsulinemia and further reduce insulin sensitivity. Insulin resistance is one of the primary factors contributing to  (MetS), causing elevated glucose and fatty  concentrations in the blood. Smoking is associated with insulin resistance in a dose-dependent manner. It directly increases the risk for insulin resistance, mainly via hormone activation, and may indirectly cause insulin resistance due to its effects on abdominal obesity. Nicotine may be the factor underlying these potential mechanisms. With the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes on the rise, and considering the role of smoking and its relationship to insulin resistance, smoking reduction or cessation may be a viable option for those who are at risk or already identified as insulin resistant. Therefore, smoking cessation or reduction would serve as a beneficial component in any diabetes prevention or treatment plan.© 2017 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632111>The Impact Of Hyperuricemia On Cardiometabolic Risk Factors In Patients With Diabetes Mellitus: A Cross-Sectional Study.</a></h1><p>Hyperuricemia (HUA) is linked to a variety of non-communicable diseases such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension, with evidence showing its role in the development of diabetes mellitus (DM). Our study's main aim was to explore the associations of HUA with other traditional risk factors in Romanian patients with DM and to assess the impact of the increase of serum UA on DM complications and HbA1c.In this cross-sectional, non-interventional study, we enrolled, according to a population-based, consecutive-case principle, 133 patients previously diagnosed with DM. HbA1c, uric , lipid profile, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, glomerular filtration rate, TSH and FT measurements were performed, while the diagnosis of retinopathy and of diabetic neuropathy was established using standardized methods.An increased uric  level was associated with a significant increase in the risk for development of stroke (OR=1.526; p=0.004). A weak, positive and statistically significant correlation can also be observed between the BMI and the presence of hyperuricemia (r=0.131; p=0.034), and between the triglyceride levels and hyperuricemia (r= 0.173; p=0.004). Glomerular filtration rate was correlated to hyperuricemia in a strong and negative manner, having an important statistical significance (r=-0.818; p=0.003). In our study, UA levels and HbA1c were negatively correlated, without reaching statistical significance.Serum UA is strongly correlated with the BMI, triglyceride level and GFR in Romanian patients with DM and HUA is significantly associated with a higher risk of stroke in these individuals.© 2019 Gaita et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647997>TAZ encodes tafazzin, a transacylase essential for cardiolipin formation and central to the etiology of Barth .</a></h1><p>Tafazzin, which is encoded by the TAZ gene, catalyzes transacylation to form mature cardiolipin and shows preference for the transfer of a linoleic  (LA) group from phosphatidylcholine (PC) to monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) with influence from mitochondrial membrane curvature.

The prevalence of CVD is closely linked to the prevalence of obesity because obesity is commonly associated with  abnormalities that are important risk factors for CVD, including insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, and type-2 diabetes, atherosclerotic dyslipidaemia, endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. Women have a more beneficial traditional CVD risk profile (lower fasting plasma glucose, less atherogenic lipid profile) and a lower absolute risk for CVD than men. However, the relative risk for CVD associated with hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia is several-fold higher in women than in men. The reasons for the sex differences in CVD risk associated with  abnormalities are unclear but could be related to differences in the mechanisms that cause hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia in men and women, which could influence the pathogenic processes involved in CVD. In the present paper, we review the influence of a person's sex on key aspects of metabolism involved in the cardiometabolic disease process, including insulin action on endogenous glucose production, tissue glucose disposal, and adipose tissue lipolysis, insulin secretion and insulin plasma clearance, postprandial glucose, fatty , and triglyceride kinetics, hepatic lipid metabolism and myocardial substrate use. We conclude that there are marked differences in many aspects of metabolism in men and women that are not all attributable to differences in the sex hormone milieu. The mechanisms responsible for these differences and the clinical implications of these observations are unclear and require further investigation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31349848>RNASET2-deficient leukoencephalopathy mimicking congenital CMV infection and Aicardi-Goutieres : a case report with a novel pathogenic variant.</a></h1><p>Ribonucleases (RNases) are crucial for degradation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). RNASET2 as a subtype of RNASEs is a 256 amino  protein, encoded by RNASET2 gene located on chromosome six. Defective RNASET2 leads to RNASET2-deficient leukoencephalopathy, a rare autosomal recessive neurogenetic disorder with psychomotor delay as its main clinical symptom. The clinical findings can be similar to congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and Aicardi-Goutieres  (AGS).Herein, we presented a patient with motor delay, neurological regression, infrequent seizures and microcephaly at 5 months of age. Brain imaging showed white matter involvement, calcification and anterior temporal cysts. Basic  tests, serum and urine CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were requested. According to clinical and imaging findings, screening of RNASET2 and RMND1 genes were performed. The clinical data and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of previous reported individuals with RNASET2-deficient leukodystrophy were also reviewed and compared to the findings of our patient.Brain MRI findings were suggestive of RNASET2-deficient leukoencephalopathy, AGS and CMV infection. Basic  tests were normal and CMV PCR was negative. Molecular study revealed a novel homozygous variant of c.233C > A; p.Ser78Ter in exon 4 of RNASET2 gene compatible with the diagnosis of RNASET2-deficient leukoencephalopathy.RNASET2-deficiency is a possible diagnosis in an infant presented with a static leukoencephalopathy and white matter involvement without megalencephaly. Due to overlapping clinical and radiologic features of RNASET2-deficient leukoencephalopathy, AGS and congenital CMV infections, molecular study as an important and helpful diagnostic tool should be considered to avoid misdiagnosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491513>MDG-1, an Ophiopogon polysaccharide, restrains process of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease via modulating the gut-liver axis.</a></h1><p>MDG-1, a β-D-fructan polysaccharide extracted from the roots of Ophiopogon japonicus, had preventive effect against obesity and hyperlipidemia in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity mice. Interestingly, MDG-1, as an inulin-type fructan, is poorly absorbed and its possible mechanism against lipid disturbance remained unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the benefits of MDG-1 treatment on NAFLD model and elucidate mechanism from the perspective of gut-liver axis, especially about gut microbiota, short chain fatty  (SCFAs) and hepatic lipid metabolism. In this study, after two months HFD feeding, C57BL/6J male mice were randomly divided into HFD group and various MDG-1 dose group. Results showed that MDG-1 markedly blocked weight gain, and ameliorated lipid accumulation, liver damage and macrovesicular steatosis. MDG-1 could restore gut microbiota balance and increase relative abundance of beneficial bacteria, especially SCFAs-producing bacteria. After degradation and utilization by the gut microbiota, MDG-1 could increase the contents of acetic  and valeric , thus regulating inflammatory responses and hepatic lipid metabolism. Specifically, MDG-1 enhanced expression of hepatic phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, accompanying by regulating hepatic adipogenesis and adipocyte differentiation, thereby inhibiting progress of NAFLD.

Loss of HCRT (ligands or receptors) causes the sleep disorder narcolepsy with cataplexy in humans and in animal models.

The aim of the present study was to assess the potential of using glutamate level to identify individuals with abdominal obesity and a high cardiometabolic risk.The study sample included 99 men and 99 women. Fasting serum glutamate was measured using the Biocrates p180 kit. Anthropometric and  variables were used to identify individuals with abdominal obesity (WC ≥ 95 cm in both sexes), the hypertriglyceridemic waist (HTW) phenotype and the  (MetS). Mean (±SD) age was 34.1 ± 10.1 years, mean BMI was 29.0 ± 6.2 kg/m and mean WC was 92.7 ± 16.5 cm. Glutamate was strongly correlated with WC (r = 0.66 for men; r = 0.76 for women, both p < 0.0001) and multiple markers of  dysfunction, particularly fasting triglyceride level (r = 0.59 for men; r = 0.57 for women, both p < 0.0001), HDL-cholesterol level (r = -0.45, p < 0.0001 in both sexes) and the HOMA-IR index (r = 0.65 for men; r = 0.60 for women, both p < 0.0001). Logistic regressions showed that glutamate had an excellent accuracy to identify individuals with abdominal obesity (ROC_AUC: 0.90 for both sexes), a good accuracy to identify those with the HTW phenotype (ROC_AUC: 0.82 for men; 0.85 for women) and fair-to-good accuracy for the MetS (ROC_AUC: 0.78 for men; 0.89 for women).Glutamate level may represent an interesting potential biomarker of abdominal obesity and  risk.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

The objective was therefore to assess insulin and amino  responses following intake of a high protein meal in healthy horses and those with EMS. Six mature horses diagnosed with EMS and six age-matched control horses without EMS were used. Horses were fed 2g/kg body mass (BM) of a high protein pellet (31% crude protein) at time 0 and 30min, for a total of 4g/kg BM, following an overnight fast. Blood samples collected during a 4h period were analysed for plasma glucose, insulin, amino  and urea concentrations. Glucose concentrations were not different between groups (P=0.2). Horses with EMS had a 9-fold greater insulinemic response to the consumption of a high protein meal compared with controls (P=0.046). Post-prandial levels of histidine, citrulline, tyrosine, valine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine and ornithine were higher in horses with EMS (P<0.05). Baseline urea nitrogen concentrations were not significantly different between groups (P=0.1).

Mechanistic analyses of excess sucrose-induced progression of  have been focused mainly on abnormal hepatic lipogenesis, and the exact contribution of excess sucrose to  disorders remains controversial. Considering that carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms exhibit clear circadian rhythms, here we investigated the possible contribution of diurnal oscillations to responses of hepatic lipid metabolism to excess sucrose. We found that excess sucrose dose-dependently promotes fatty liver and hyperlipidemia in in rats fed a high-sucrose diet (HSD). We observed that excess sucrose enhances the oscillation amplitudes of the expression of clock genes along with the levels of hepatic lipid and carbohydrate metabolism-related mRNAs that increase lipogenesis. We did not observe similar changes in the levels of the transcription factors regulating the expression of these genes. This suggested that the excess sucrose-induced, circadian rhythm-dependent amplification of lipogenesis is post-transcriptionally regulated via the stability of  gene transcripts. Of note, our findings also provide evidence that fructose causes some of the HSD-induced, circadian rhythm-dependent alterations in lipogenic gene expression. Our discovery of HSD-induced circadian rhythm-dependent alterations in lipogenesis at the post-transcriptional level may inform future studies investigating the complex relationships among sucrose uptake, circadian rhythm, and  enzyme expression.

An additional, unusual increase in Aβ39 indicates a rarely observed product line deviation in the generation of the shorter Aβ species. Our observations extend the range of PSEN1 mutations to be considered in familial dementia.

Monosodium L-glutamate (MSG) may cause  diseases such as obesity. Meanwhile, the Chinese population has undergone rapid transition to a high-fat diet. There is little information available on the effect of MSG and fat alone, or in combination, on free fatty  (FFAs), lipid metabolism and FFA receptors.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of MSG and fat alone, or in combination, on intestinal luminal FFAs and expression of gastrointestinal FFA receptors. The aim was also to test whether dietary fat and/or MSG could affect expression of genes related to fatty  metabolism.A total of 32 growing pigs were used and fed with four iso-nitrogenous and iso-caloric diets. Pigs in the four treatments received diets with one of two fat concentrations levels (4.4 and 9.4%) and one of two MSG dose levels (0 and 3%), in which most of the fat were brought by soybean oil. The concentration of short chain fatty  (SCFAs) in cecum and colon, long chain fatty  (LCFAs) in ileum, cecum and colon, and FFAs receptors expression in hypothalamus and gastrointestinal tract were determined.MSG and/or fat changed intestinal luminal SCFAs, levels of LCFAs, and showed an antagonistic effect on most of LCFAs. Simultaneously, MSG and/or fat decreased the expression of FFA receptors in hypothalamus and gastrointestinal tract. MSG and/or fat promoted fat deposition through different ways in back fat.Our results support that MSG and/or fat can alter intestinal luminal FFAs composition and concentration, especially LCFAs, in addition, the expression of FFA receptors in ileum and hypothalamus could be decreased. Moreover, MSG and/or fat can promote protein deposition in back fat, and affect the distribution and metabolism of fatty  in the body tissues and the body's ability to perceive fatty ; these results provide a reference for the occurrence of fat deposition and obesity caused by high-fat and monosodium glutamate diet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31414336>Role of angiotensin type 2 receptor in improving lipid metabolism and preventing adiposity.</a></h1><p>Recent studies on mice with null mutation of the angiotensin type 2 receptor (ATR) gene have implicated the involvement of ATR in regulating adipocyte size and obesity, a major risk factor for . However, the outcome from these studies remains inconclusive. Therefore, current study was designed to test whether pharmacological activation of ATR regulates adiposity and lipid metabolism. Male mice (5-weeks old) were pre-treated with vehicle or ATR agonist (C21, 0.3 mg/kg, i.p., daily, for 4 days) and fed normal diet (ND). Then these animals were subdivided into ND and high-fat diet (HFD) regimen and concomitantly treated with vehicle or C21 through day 14. Vehicle-treated HFD-fed mice demonstrated an increase in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) weight and adipocyte size, which were associated with increased eWAT expression of the lipogenic regulators, fatty  binding protein and fatty  synthase, decreased expression of adipose triglyceride lipase and increased expression of hormone-sensitive lipase. Interestingly, C21 pre-treatment altered HFD-induced changes in lipogenic and lipolytic regulators. C21 pre-treatment prevented decrease in expression of uncoupler protein-1 in brown adipose in HFD-fed mice, which was associated with increased core temperature. In addition, C21 pre-treatment ameliorated plasma-free fatty , triglycerides, insulin and tumor necrosis factor-α in HFD-fed mice. Ex-vivo study in isolated primary epididymal adipocytes revealed that C21 inhibits long chain fatty  transporter, via a nitric oxide synthase/guanylate cyclase/protein kinase G-dependent pathway.

There is limited information about the association of plasma phospholipid fatty  (FAs) with obesity and the MetS among black South Africans.To investigate the association of dietary FAs and plasma phospholipid FA patterns, respectively, with measures of adiposity (body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio) and the MetS in black South Africans.Factor analysis was used to identify FA patterns from 11 dietary FAs and 26 individual plasma phospholipid FAs. Cross-sectional association of the identified patterns with measures of adiposity and the MetS was investigated. A random sample of 711 black South African adults aged 30 to 70 years (273 men, 438 women) from the North West Province was selected from the South African leg of the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study. Sequential regression models adjusted for confounders were applied to investigate the association between dietary FAs and plasma phospholipid FA patterns with measures of adiposity and the MetS.Two patterns were derived from dietary FAs and six patterns from plasma phospholipid FAs that explained the cumulative variance of 89 and 73%, respectively. The association of FA patterns with adiposity and the MetS was weaker for dietary FA patterns than for plasma phospholipid FA patterns. The plasma phospholipid FA pattern with high loadings of saturated FAs (high-Satfat) and another with high loadings of n-3 very-long-chain PUFAs (n-3 VLC-PUFAs) were positively associated with measures of adiposity and the MetS, while patterns with positive loadings of LC monounsaturated fatty  (n-9 LC-MUFA) and a positive loading of n-3 essential FAs (n-3 EFA) showed inverse associations with the MetS and some measures of adiposity.The n-9 LC-MUFA and n-3 EFA patterns seemed to provide possible protective associations with adiposity and the MetS, whereas the high-Satfat and n-3 VLC-PUFA patterns were associated with adiposity and the MetS in our study participants.

Insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia are hallmarks of  (MetS). However, the role of SCG3 in MetS remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between serum SCG3 levels and  parameters in subjects with and without MetS. This was a case control study, and 295 subjects were recruited. Serum SCG3 concentrations were compared between groups. Associations between SCG3 levels and clinico- parameters were also examined. We found serum SCG3 levels were higher in the MetS group than non-MetS group (122.6 ± 79.2 vs. 90.6 ± 58.5 nmol/L,  = 0.009). Specifically, elevated SCG3 levels were found in subjects with high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, central obesity, or hypertriglyceridemia. Additionally, MetS was an independent factor of serum SCG3 levels in multivariate linear regression analyses. Moreover, FPG, free fatty , and waist circumference were positively associated with serum SCG3 concentrations after adjusting for insulin levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and cardiovascular risk factors. In conclusion, serum SCG3 concentrations were higher in subjects with MetS and were independently associated with FPG levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636850>Intracutaneous Delivery of Gelatins Reduces Fat Accumulation in Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue.</a></h1><p>Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) accumulation is a constitutional disorder resulting from . Although surgical and non-surgical methods for reducing SAT exist, patients remain non-compliant because of potential adverse effects and cost. In this study, we developed a new minimally-invasive approach to achieve SAT reduction, using a microneedle (MN) patch prepared from gelatin, which is capable of regulating fat metabolism. Four gelatin types were used: three derived from fish (SA-FG, GT-FG 220, and GT-FG 250), and one from swine (SM-PG 280). We applied gelatin-based MN patches five times over 4 weeks to rats with high-fat diet (HD)-induced obesity, and determined the resulting amount of SAT. We also investigated the histological features and determined the expression levels of fat metabolism-associated genes in SAT using hematoxylin and eosin staining and western blotting, respectively. SAT decreased following treatment with all four gelatin MN patches. Smaller adipocytes were observed in the regions treated with SA-FG, GT-FG 250, and SM-PG 280 MNs, demonstrating a decline in fat accumulation. The expression levels of fat metabolism-associated genes in the MN-treated SAT revealed that GT-FG 220 regulates fatty  synthase (FASN) protein levels. These findings suggest that gelatin MN patches aid in decreasing the quantity of unwanted SAT by altering lipid metabolism and fat deposition.Copyright © 2019 The Korean Society Of Toxicology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657510>The Buckwheat Iminosugar d-Fagomine Attenuates Sucrose-Induced Steatosis and Hypertension in Rats.</a></h1><p>This study examines the long-term functional effects of d-fagomine on sucrose- induced factors of  dysfunctions and explores possible molecular mechanisms behind its action.Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were fed a 35% sucrose solution with d-fagomine (or not, for comparison) or mineral water (controls) for 24 weeks.

To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free fatty  (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the liver and utilization for fuel or gluconeogenesis in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte mitochondria were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major  controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like  condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Bcs1l mutant mice with severe CIII deficiency, energy deprivation and post-weaning lipolysis respond to fasting similarly to wild-type mice, suggesting largely normal systemic lipid mobilization and utilization mechanisms.Copyright © 2019.

In contrast to breastfed infants, excessive protein in IMF is associated with overweight and symptoms of  in formula-fed infants. Moreover, the beta-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) content in cow milk is 3-4 g/L, whereas it is not present in human milk. It is considered to be a major reason for cow milk allergy in infants. In this respect, to modify protein composition, increasing the ratio of alpha-lactalbumin (α-Lac) to β-Lg would be a pragmatic approach to develop a hypoallergenic IMF with low protein content. Such a formula would ensure the necessary balance of essential amino , as 123 and 162 amino  residues are available in α-Lac and β-Lg, respectively. Hence, in this study, a pasteurized form of hypoallergenic and low-protein ready-to-feed (RTF) formula, a new product, is developed to retain heat-sensitive bioactives and other components. Therefore, the effects of high pressure processing (HPP) under 300-600 MPa at approximately 20-40 °C and HTST pasteurization (72 °C for 15 and 30 s) were investigated and compared. The highest ratio of α-Lac to β-Lg was achieved after HPP (600 MPa for 5 min applied at 40.4 °C), which potentially explains the synergistic effect of HPP and heat on substantial denaturation of β-Lg, with significant retention of α-Lac in reconstituted IMF. : This investigation showed the potential production of a pasteurized RTF formula, a niche product, with a reduced amount of allergenic β-Lg.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564943>High-fat diet-induced kidney alterations in rats with : endothelial dysfunction and decreased antioxidant defense.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to investigate changes in renal function and the AGE-RAGE axis in the kidney of a non-genetic animal model of  (MetS) induced by high-fat diet (HFD). Additionally, we evaluated the protective effect of pyridoxamine (PM), a vitamin B6 analog with anti-AGE effects, in the context of diet-related renal endothelial dysfunction.In Wistar rats, the MetS animal model was induced by 20 or 28 weeks of HFD feeding. When indicated, a subgroup of animals was treated daily with PM (60 mg/kg) for 2 months. Tissue perfusion in renal microcirculation was examined by laser speckle contrast imaging. Oxidative stress was analyzed by thiobarbituric  reactive species and the inflammatory markers by ELISA (TNF-α and IL-1β). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze eNOs, IL-6, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), NADPH oxidase subunit 47 (N47), catalase, and receptor for AGE (RAGE) gene expression.Wistar rats fed a HFD showed negligible alteration in renal function, decrease in catalase mRNA transcripts and catalase enzyme activity compared to control (CTL) animals. Increased levels of IL-1β were observed in the kidney of MetS-induced rats. HFD-fed rats exhibited kidney endothelial dysfunction, with no significant differences in basal microvascular blood flow. PM significantly improved kidney vasorelaxation in HFD-fed rats. eNOS, VCAM, and RAGE gene expression and AGE content were not altered in kidneys of HFD-induced MetS rats in comparison to CTLs.Our findings suggest that HFD-induced microvascular dysfunction precedes the decline in renal function, and could be related to antioxidant machinery defects and inflammation activation in the kidney. PM showed a vasoprotective effect, and thus, could be an important contributory factor in ameliorating diet-induced renal damage.© 2019 Rangel Silvares et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31436750>Phytol and its metabolites phytanic and pristanic  for risk of cancer: current evidence and future directions.</a></h1><p>This review summarizes the current evidence on the potential role of phytol, a microbial metabolite of chlorophyl A, and its metabolites, phytanic and pristanic , in carcinogenesis. Primary food sources in Western diets are the nut skin for phytol and lipids in dairy, beef and fish for its metabolites. Phytol and its metabolites gained interest as dietary compounds for cancer prevention because, as natural ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α and -γ and retinoid X receptor, phytol and its metabolites have provided some evidence in cell culture studies and limited evidence in animal models of anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti- properties at physiological concentrations. However, there may be a narrow range of efficacy, because phytol and its metabolites at supra-physiological concentrations can cause in vitro cytotoxicity in non-cancer cells and can cause morbidity and mortality in animal models. In human studies, evidence for a role of phytol and its metabolites in cancer prevention is currently limited and inconclusive. In short, phytol and its metabolites are potential dietary compounds for cancer prevention, assuming the challenges in preventing cytotoxicity in non-cancer cells and animal models and understanding phytol metabolism can be mitigated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31464016>Beneficial effects of celery (Apium graveolens) on : A review of the existing evidences.</a></h1><p>The  (MetS) is a cluster of multiple conditions that includes hypertension, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, and hyperglycemia disorders. Most studies revealed that the MetS is accompanied with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and insulin resistance. It can be said that, in treating or preventing the MetS and its components, lifestyle adjustment and weight loss have a vital role. According to various studies, among natural compounds, celery (Apium graveolens) is one of the most important sources of phytochemicals such as phenolic , flavones, flavonols, and antioxidants such as vitamin C, beta-carotene (Provitamin A), and manganese. These antioxidants have a role in decreasing the oxidative damage. The phytochemicals in celery decrease the activity of proinflammatory cytokines and prevent inflammation. Also, flavonoids in celery suppress cardiovascular inflammation. Oxidative stress and inflammation in the blood stream are the main risk factors in increasing cardiovascular disease, especially atherosclerosis. Celery phthalides leads to expanding of smooth muscle in the blood vessels and lower blood pressure. As a result, the most active ingredients in celery (A. graveolens (have shown hypolipidemic, antidiabetic, and hypotensive properties.

We found that p-synephrine suppressed the 3T3-L1 cell adipogenesis by reducing the expression level of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), which subsequently led to a reduction in the fatty -binding protein 4 (aP2) expression. p-Synephrine treatment markedly activated the protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) pathway and sequentially inhibited glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activity. Inhibition of GSK3β activity by LiCl was found to partially ameliorate the above-mentioned effects. All these data suggested that p-synephrine exhibited the anti-adipogenic effects via the regulation of Akt signaling pathway and the suppression of adipogenesis-related proteins. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Citrus aurantium often uses as herbal or dietary supplement in various countries around the world, including in Seville, Spain and South Africa. In traditional Chinese herbs, it is referred to as "Fructus aurantii immaturus," "Zhi shi," or "Zhi ke," and has been used for hundreds of years for various digestive problems. Its primary protoalkaloid, p-synephrine, exhibited lipolytic effects and energy expenditure, which has rapidly replaced ephedrine as an "ephedra-free" alternative dietary supplement. The current study firstly demonstrated the anti-adipogenic effects of p-synephrine in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, which was due to the regulation of Akt signaling pathway and the subsequent suppression of adipogenesis-related proteins. The present study may offer invaluable opinions into the mechanisms of body weight/fat-losing activities of p-synephrine in theory, and scientific experimental evidence on dietary supplement in practice. p-Synephrine could be utilized for the preventive and therapeutic uses against .© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675161>Interaction of Gut Microbiota and High-sodium, Low-potassium Diet in Altering Plasma Triglyceride Profiles Revealed by Lipidomics Analysis.</a></h1><p>High-sodium and low-potassium (HNaLK) intake increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and .

Lipidomic data were then analyzed using various statistical and bioinformatics tools, which detected numerous lipid species altered by the treatments, and consistently demonstrated interactions between the gut microbiota and the HNaLK diet in altering circulating lipids, mainly triglycerides (TGs). We identified two distinct TG groups, differentially regulated by antibiotic treatment. One group (cluster 1), representing the majority of TG species detected, was downregulated, whereas the other group (cluster 2) was upregulated by antibiotic treatment. Interestingly, cluster 2 TGs were also regulated by the diet. Cluster 2 TGs exhibited greater carbon-chain length and double-bond content and included TGs composed of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty , previously associated with reduced diabetes risk.The HNaLK diet interacts with gut bacteria to alter plasma lipid profiles, which may be related to its health effects.

Their role in the reduction of lipid deposits in liver tissue is not unequivocal. CLA contain an equimolar mixture of two isomers of linoleic : trans-10,cis-12 CLA and cis-9,trans-11. Only one isomer - trans-10,cis-12 CLA exhibits fat-reducing properties, cis-9,trans-11 CLA does not. The main goal of this study was to determine if CLA isomers affect the activation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) in liver cells and tissue. FoxO1 is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulation of lipid and carbohydrates metabolism. In vitro and in vivo models of our study were HepG2 cells and C57BL/6J mice. Methods used in the study were qPCR - quantification of FoxO1 gene expression, Western blot - posttranslational phosphorylation of FoxO1, Oil Red O (ORO) - lipid staining and ELISA - quantification of apoB100. In both models trans-10,cis-12 CLA diminished FoxO1 gene expression: decrease by 44.1 ± 20.9% SD in the cells and 65.4 ± 29.8% SD in mice. The lowest accumulation of lipids (drop of 37.2 ± 1.7% SD) and the highest increase of apoB100 protein (74 ± 12.8% SD) were detected in the medium of cells cultured with trans-10,cis-12 CLA. Both isomers of linoleic  have different effects on lipid metabolism. Isomer c9,t11 CLA accelerates lipogenesis, whereas isomer t10,c12 CLA activates secretion of lipids in HepG2 cells. In contrast to the in vitro study, unfortunately this pro-health property of t10,c12 CLA was not confirmed in the in vivo model.

The mechanistic link explaining this association is the pattern of lipid partitioning in the face of excess calories and energy surplus. A tight relation exists between typical lipid deposition patterns, specifically within the skeletal muscle and liver, as well as the intra-abdominal compartment and whole body insulin sensitivity. The impact of lipid deposition within insulin responsive tissues such as the liver and skeletal muscle relates to the ability of fatty  derivates to inhibit elements of the insulin signal transduction pathway. Strengthening the relation of obesity and reduced insulin sensitivity are the observations that weight gain reduces insulin sensitivity while weight loss increases it. This manifests as the appearance of cardiovascular risk factor clustering with weight gain and its recovery in the face of weight loss.

Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly obesity-associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced  distress. Further comprehensive research has to be conducted to brace its clinical relevance, reproducibility and efficacy for aiding human health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340670>Diesel Exhaust Induces Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Hyperlipidemia, and Liver Steatosis.</a></h1><p>Air pollution is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as dyslipidemia and . Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on lipid metabolism in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized fatty  9-HODE (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d, 5 days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of 9-HODE and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with oleic . As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and oleic  did not alter de novo lipogenesis but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse liver, with DE particles and oleic  also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased lipid catabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31396550>Cocaine-Induced Brugada Pattern.</a></h1><p>Brugada phenocopies are clinical entities etiologically distinct from congenital Brugada ; differentiation is crucial for management.A 29 year-old male with a history of cocaine abuse, brought in by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) after he was found unresponsive and given naloxone. He was found altered but arousable with verbal stimuli. He reported snorting a white powder to get "high". He denied family history of sudden death or previous history of syncope. His ECG on presentation showed coved, ≥2 mm ST elevation with T-wave inversion in V2 consistent with Brugada EKG pattern (Figure 1). His troponin was trending up with elevated creatinine 1.6 mg/dl, liver enzymes and lactic , and urine toxicology was positive for cocaine.The presentation of altered mental status is multifactorial:  derangement, drugs misuse and Brugada. Finding Brugada EKG pattern should be investigated to differentiate congenital Brugada  and Brugada phenocopies. This patient has no family history of sudden death and no prior history of syncope. Serial EKG showed a gradual resolution of the coved and ST elevation in V2.our case demonstrates the importance of careful history taking including family history, as well as serial ECGs and treating the possible underlying etiology such as drugs abuse or electrolytes abnormality. It is also warranted to differentiate between Brugada phenocopies from congenital Brugada  because therapeutic strategies are quite different with each diagnosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461988>Exhaled Breath Analysis in Obstructive Sleep Apnea : A Review of the Literature.</a></h1><p> Obstructive sleep apnea  (OSAS) represents an independent risk factor for cardiovascular,  and neurological events. Polysomnography is the gold-standard for the diagnosis, however is expensive and time-consuming and not suitable for widespread use. Breath analysis is an innovative, non-invasive technique, able to provide clinically relevant information about OSAS. This systematic review was aimed to outline available evidence on the role of exhaled breath analysis in OSAS, taking into account the techniques' level of adherence to the recently proposed technical standards.  Articles reporting original data on exhaled breath analysis in OSAS were identified through a computerized and manual literature search and screened. Duplicate publications, case reports, case series, conference papers, expert opinions, comments, reviews and meta-analysis were excluded. : Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) is higher in OSAS patients than controls, however its absolute value is within reported normal ranges. FeNO association with AHI is controversial, as well as its change after continuous positive airway pressure (C-PAP) therapy. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is  in OSAS, cytokines and oxidative stress markers are elevated, they positively correlate with AHI and normalize after treatment. The analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by spectrometry or electronic nose is able to discriminate OSAS from healthy controls. The main technical issues regards the dilution of EBC and the lack of external validation in VOCs studies.  Exhaled breath analysis has a promising role in the understanding of mechanisms underpinning OSAS and has demonstrated a clinical relevance in identifying individuals affected by the disease, in assessing the response to treatment and, potentially, to monitor patient's adherence to mechanical ventilation. Albeit the majority of the technical standards proposed by the ERS committee have been followed by existing papers, further work is needed to uniform the methodology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410156>Role and effective therapeutic target of gut microbiota in NAFLD/NASH.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most prevalent chronic liver disease in the world, is affected by numerous extrinsic and intrinsic factors, including lifestyle, environment, diet, genetic susceptibility,  and gut microbiota. Accumulating evidence has proven that gut dysbiosis is significantly associated with the development and progression of NAFLD, and several highly variable species in gut microbiota have been identified. The gut microbiota contributes to NAFLD by abnormal regulation of the liver-gut axis, gut microbial components and microbial metabolites, and affects the secretion of bile . Due to the key role of the gut microbiota in NAFLD, it has been regarded as a potential target for the pharmacological and clinical treatment of NAFLD. The present review provides a systematic summary of the characterization of gut microbiota and the significant association between the gut microbiota and NAFLD. The possible mechanisms of how the gut microbiota is involved in promoting the development and progression of NAFLD were also discussed. In addition, the potential therapeutic methods for NAFLD based on the gut microbiota were summarized.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500345>Reconstitution in Proteoliposomes of the Recombinant Human Riboflavin Transporter 2 (SLC52A2) Overexpressed in .</a></h1><p>the  gene encodes for the riboflavin transporter 2 (RFVT2). This transporter is ubiquitously expressed. It mediates the transport of Riboflavin across cell membranes.

NAFLD is a multisystem disease that is characterized by hepatic fat accumulation due in part to dysregulated energy metabolism network through epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation. DNA methylation affects fetal programing and disease risk via regulation of gene transcription; it is affected by methyl donor nutrients such as vitamin B , methionine, folic , vitamin B , and choline. Although several studies have documented the role of several maternal methyl donor nutrients on obesity-induced NAFLD in offspring, currently, data are lacking on its impact on CVD risk as an endpoint. The aim of this paper is to use current knowledge to construct a postulation for the potential role of a comprehensive gestational methyl donor nutrients supplementary approach on the susceptibility of offspring to developing -related cardiovascular complications.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into two groups: healthy and rats with MetS, and then depending on dietary patterns on six groups: healthy rats fed with Sd, healthy rats fed with Sd and SAE, rats with MetS fed with HFd, rats with MetS fed with HFd and SAE, rats with MetS fed with Sd, and rats with MetS fed with Sd and SAE. 4 weeks later, after an overnight fast (12-14 h), blood for determination of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), index of lipid peroxidation (measured as TBARS), and FA was collected. Increased FA and lipid concentration found in MetS rats were reduced when changing dietary habits from HFd to Sd with or without SAE consumption. Consumption of SAE slightly affects the FA profiles, mostly palmitoleic  in healthy rats and PUFA in MetS + HFd rats. Nevertheless, in a high-fat diet, SAE supplementation significantly decreases n-6/n-3 ratio, thereby decreasing systemic inflammation. Further researches are warranted to confirm these effects in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554528>Randomized trial of chronic supplementation with a nutraceutical mixture to subjects with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).</a></h1><p>A mixture of natural ingredients, namely docosahexaenoic  (DHA), phosphatidylcholine, silymarin, choline, curcumin and D-α-tocopherol, was studied in subjects with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Primary end-points were serum levels of hepatic enzymes; other parameters of liver function,  and inflammation were secondary end-points. The coagulation-fibrinolysis balance was also thoroughly investigated, as NAFLD is associated with haemostatic alterations, which might contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk of this condition. Study design: double-blind, randomized, multicenter, controlled trial on two parallel groups. Subjects with NAFLD (18-80 years, either sex) received the active or control treatment for three months. All assays were performed before and at the end of supplementation, on 113 total subjects. The hepatic enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase decreased after treatment from 23.2% to 3.7%, reaching statistical significance only for AST levels. However, there were no differences between control and active groups.  and inflammatory variables were unchanged, except for a slight (less than 10%) increase of cholesterol and glucose levels after the active treatment. Coagulation-fibrinolytic parameters were unaffected by either treatment. In conclusion, chronic supplementation with the mixture of dietary compounds was well tolerated and apparently safe in NAFLD subjects. The trial failed to demonstrate any efficacy on relevant physio-pathological markers, but its protocol and results may be useful to design future studies with natural compounds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541119>2-Aminoadipic  (2-AAA) as a potential biomarker for insulin resistance in childhood obesity.</a></h1><p>Insulin resistance is an important clinical feature of , which includes obesity and type 2 diabetes. Increased adipose energy storage in obesity promote insulin resistance and other  adverse effects. To identify a new link between adipocyte and insulin resistance, we performed targeted metabolite profiling of differentiated adipocytes and studied the association between adipogenic metabolites and insulin resistance. We found a correlation between 2-aminoadipic  (2-AAA) and adipogenic differentiation. Also, circulatory 2-AAA was positively associated with obesity-related factors (fat mass, fat percent, waist circumference, BMI, BMI z-score, triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR) at baseline and after 2 years in the children cohort study. Of these factors, increased BMI z-score and HOMA-IR were the primary independent factors associated with higher 2-AAA levels, and the baseline 2-AAA level was an indicator of the BMI z-score after 2 years. To validate the relationship between 2-AAA and obesity-related factors, we analyzed changes in 2-AAA levels following obesity intervention programs in two independent studies. In both studies, changes in 2-AAA levels during the intervention period were positively correlated with changes in the BMI z-score and HOMA-IR after adjusting for confounders. Moreover, the 2-AAA levels were increased in cell and mouse models of obesity-related insulin resistance. Excess 2-AAA levels led to impaired insulin signaling in insulin-sensitive cells (liver, skeletal muscle and adipose cells) and caused abnormal gluconeogenesis. Our results demonstrate that 2-AAA is associated with adipogenesis and insulin resistance. In this regard, 2-AAA could be a potential biomarker of obesity and obesity-related  disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387271>Relationship of the Phytochemicals from Coffee and Cocoa By-Products with their Potential to Modulate Biomarkers of  In Vitro.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to compare the phytochemicals from coffee and cocoa by-products and their relationship with the potential for reducing markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, adipogenesis, and insulin resistance in vitro. We characterized the phytochemical profile of extracts from coffee husk, coffee silverskin, and cocoa shell and evaluated their in vitro biological activity in RAW264.7 macrophages and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Pearson correlations and principal component regressions were performed to find the contribution of phytochemicals and underlying mechanisms of action. Coffee husk and silverskin extracts were mainly composed of caffeine and chlorogenic . Major components in cocoa shell included theobromine and protocatechuic . Both coffee and cocoa by-product extracts effectively reduced inflammatory markers in macrophages and adipocytes (NO, PGE, TNF-α, MCP-1, and IL-6) and the production of reactive oxygen species (21.5-66.4%). Protocatechuic and chlorogenic , together with caffeine, were suggested as main contributors against inflammation and oxidative stress. Furthermore, extracts reduced lipid accumulation (4.1-49.1%) in adipocytes by regulating lipolysis and inducing adipocyte browning. Gallic and chlorogenic  were associated with reduced adipogenesis, and caffeine with adipocyte browning. Extracts from coffee and cocoa by-products also modulated the phosphorylation of insulin receptor signaling pathway and stimulated GLUT-4 translocation (52.4-72.9%), increasing glucose uptake. The insulin-sensitizing potential of the extracts was mainly associated with protocatechuic . For the first time, we identified the phytochemicals from coffee and cocoa by-products and offered new insights into their associations with biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, adipogenesis, and insulin resistance in vitro.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679358>Relationship between  and Uric  Levels in Patients with Familial Mediterranean Fever.</a></h1><p>This study aims to investigate the prevalence of  (MetS) in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and the relationship between serum uric  (SUA) concentrations and MetS status by sex in patients with FMF.This cross-sectional study included all attack-free patients previously diagnosed with FMF who referred to the rheumatology clinic for follow-up between October 2018 and January 2019. This study included 154 patients with FMF (66 males and 88 females) and 154 controls (62 males and 92 females) with similar age and sex.MetS was more prevalent among the FMF patients compared to the controls (42.90% [95% CI: 34.9-51.1%) vs. 28.57% [95% CI: 21.6-36.4%); OR=1.88, 95% Cl: 1.17-3.01, P=0.009]. In the FMF group, we found higher SUA, number of MetS components, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and insulin compared to the control group (P<0.001, P<0.001, P=0.018, P=0.002, P=0.008, respectively). The prevalence of MetS (men: P<0.001, women: P<0.001) and number of MetS components (men: P<0.001, women: P<0.001) were significantly increased with increasing SUA quartiles in both sexes.The prevalence of MetS was higher in patients with FMF, and the prevalence of MetS and number of MetS components were significantly increased with increasing SUA quartiles in both men and women with FMF. SUA levels, as a biochemical marker, could be a strong and independent predictor of MetS in patients with FMF, and may provide substantial help with early diagnosis and management of MetS.© 2019 The Author(s).

This narrative review assessed the recent epidemiological and clinical research that examined the consumption of dairy-derived saturated fatty  (SFA) on  risk. In addition, this review evaluated studies of individual SFA to gain insight into the potential mechanisms at play with intake of a diet enriched with these dairy-derived fatty . This work underscores that SFA are a heterogenous class of fatty  that can differ considerably in their biological activity within the body depending on their length and specific chemical structure. In summary, previous work on the impact of dairy-derived SFA consumption on disease risk suggests that there is currently insufficient evidence to support current dietary guidelines which consolidate all dietary SFA into a single group of nutrients whose consumption should be reduced, regardless of dietary source, food matrix, and composition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635032>Plasma Metabolomics Identifies Lipid and Amino  Markers of Weight Loss in Patients with Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer.</a></h1><p>Cachexia is a multifactorial wasting  associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. Diagnosis can be difficult and, in the clinical situation, usually relies upon reported weight loss. The 'omics' technologies allow us the opportunity to study the end points of many biological processes. Among these, blood-based metabolomics is a promising method to investigate the pathophysiology of human cancer cachexia and identify candidate biomarkers. In this study, we performed liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based metabolomics to investigate the  profile of cancer-associated weight loss. Non-selected patients undergoing surgery with curative intent for upper gastrointestinal cancer were recruited. Fasting plasma samples were taken at induction of anaesthesia. LC/MS analysis showed that 6 metabolites were highly discriminative of weight loss. Specifically, a combination profile of LysoPC 18.2, L-Proline, Hexadecanoic , Octadecanoic , Phenylalanine and LysoPC 16:1 showed close correlation for eight weight-losing samples (≥5% weight loss) and nine weight-stable samples (<5%weight loss) between predicted and actual weight change (r = 0.976,  = 0.0014). Overall, 40 metabolites were associated with ≥5% weight loss. This study provides biological validation of the consensus definition of cancer cachexia (Fearon et al.) and provides feasible candidate markers for further investigation in early diagnosis and the assessment of therapeutic intervention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31357483>The IDO  Trap Hypothesis for the Etiology of ME/CFS.</a></h1><p>Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue  (ME/CFS) is a debilitating noncommunicable disease brandishing an enormous worldwide disease burden with some evidence of inherited genetic risk. Absence of measurable changes in patients' standard blood work has necessitated ad hoc symptom-driven therapies and a dearth of mechanistic hypotheses regarding its etiology and possible cure. A new hypothesis, the indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)  trap, was developed and formulated as a mathematical model. The historical occurrence of ME/CFS outbreaks is a singular feature of the disease and implies that any predisposing genetic mutation must be common. A database search for common damaging mutations in human enzymes produces 208 hits, including IDO2 with four such mutations. Non-functional IDO2, combined with well-established substrate inhibition of IDO1 and kinetic asymmetry of the large neutral amino  transporter, LAT1, yielded a mathematical model of tryptophan metabolism that displays both physiological and pathological steady-states. Escape from the pathological one requires an exogenous perturbation. This model also identifies a critical point in cytosolic tryptophan abundance beyond which descent into the pathological steady-state is inevitable. If, however, means can be discovered to return cytosolic tryptophan below the critical point, return to the normal physiological steady-state is assured. Testing this hypothesis for any cell type requires only labelled tryptophan, a means to measure cytosolic tryptophan and kynurenine, and the standard tools of tracer kinetics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573550>The gut microbiome and .</a></h1><p>The  (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors that, if left untreated, will often progress to greater  defects such as type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

In this Review we present the existing recent literature that supports the gut microbiome's potential influence on the various risk factors of MetS. The interplay of the intestinal microbiota with host metabolism has been shown to be mediated by a myriad of factors, including a defective gut barrier, bile  metabolism, antibiotic use, and the pleiotropic effects of microbially produced metabolites.

Due to the increasing prevalence of , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has evolved into a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma development. Herein, we investigated whether a dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) supplementation improves the outcome of progressive NAFLD.Feeding three high-fat diets, differing in n-3 and n-6 PUFA contents and ratios (n-3/n-6: 1:8, 1:1, 5:1), the impact of n-3 PUFAs and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios on NAFLD-related liver fibrosis and tumorigenesis was analyzed in 12- and 20-week-old streptozotocin/high-fat diet (STZ/HFD)-treated mice.Feeding of n-3 PUFA-rich diets (1:1 and 5:1) resulted in increased hepatic n-3 PUFA content and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio with decreased hepatic lipid accumulation. In 20-week-old mice, n-3 PUFA-rich diets alleviated tumor load significantly, with reduced liver/body weight index, tumor size, and tumor number. Finally, these effects were accompanied by a significant improvement of survival of these mice.Herein, we showed that increased n-3 PUFA content and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios lead to improved survival and attenuated tumor progression in STZ/HFD-treated mice. Thus, n-3 PUFAs could be the basis for new therapeutic options against NAFLD-related tumorigenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385063>Cross-sectional association between non-soy legume consumption, serum uric  and hyperuricemia: the PREDIMED-Plus study.</a></h1><p>To assess the association between the consumption of non-soy legumes and different subtypes of non-soy legumes and serum uric  (SUA) or hyperuricemia in elderly individuals with overweight or obesity and .A cross-sectional analysis was conducted in the framework of the PREDIMED-Plus study. We included 6329 participants with information on non-soy legume consumption and SUA levels. Non-soy legume consumption was estimated using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Linear regression models and Cox regression models were used to assess the associations between tertiles of non-soy legume consumption, different subtypes of non-soy legume consumption and SUA levels or hyperuricemia prevalence, respectively.Individuals in the highest tertile (T3) of total non-soy legume, lentil and pea consumption, had 0.14 mg/dL, 0.19 mg/dL and 0.12 mg/dL lower SUA levels, respectively, compared to those in the lowest tertile (T1), which was considered the reference one.

A comprehensive study on plasma metabolites was conducted, and metabolites were compared between the OAB and control groups.Age was significantly higher in the OAB group, while prostate volume did not differ between the groups. A 24-h bladder diary revealed that nocturnal urine volume, 24-h micturition frequency, nocturnal micturition frequency, and the nocturnal index were significantly higher in the OAB group, whereas maximum voided volume was significantly lower in this group. The metabolomics analysis identified 79 metabolites from the plasma of participants. The multivariate analysis showed that increases in the fatty  (22:1), erucic  and palmitoleic , and a decrease in cholic  correlated with incidence of male OAB. A decrease in acylcarnitine (18:2)-3 and an increase in cis-11-eicosenoic  also appeared to be associated with OAB in males.OAB in males may occur through the abnormal metabolism of fatty  and bile .

In contrast, its genesis in non-canonical (secondary) 3-MGAs, a growing-up group of disorders encompassing more than a dozen of inherited  diseases, is a mystery still remaining unresolved for three decades. To puzzle out this anthologic problem of metabolism, three clues were considered: (i) the variety of disorders suggests a common cellular target at the cross-road of  and signaling pathways, (ii) the response to leucine loading test only discriminative for primary but not secondary 3-MGAs suggests these latter are disorders of extramitochondrial HMG-CoA metabolism as also attested by their failure to increase 3-hydroxyisovalerate, a mitochondrial metabolite accumulating only in primary 3-MGAs, (iii) the peroxisome is an extramitochondrial site possessing its own pool and displaying metabolism of HMG-CoA, suggesting its possible involvement in producing extramitochondrial 3-methylglutaconate (3-MG). Following these clues provides a unifying common basis to non-canonical 3-MGAs: constitutive mitochondrial dysfunction induces AMPK activation which, by inhibiting early steps in cholesterol and fatty  syntheses, pipelines cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA to peroxisomes where a rise in HMG-CoA followed by local dehydration and hydrolysis may lead to 3-MGA yield. Additional contributors are considered, notably for 3-MGAs associated with hyperammonemia, and to a lesser extent in CLPB deficiency.  and signaling itineraries followed by the proposed scenario are essentially sketched, being provided with compelling evidence from the literature coming in their support.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Subsequently, the impact of omega-3 on PCOS, omega-3 and inflammation, omega-3 and insulin resistance, omega-3 and adipokines, omega-3 and lipid metabolism, omega-3 and endothelial function and omega-3 and hormonal factors were discussed. There are multiple mechanisms by which -3 PUFAs may exert their beneficial effects on PCOS, including anti-obesity, glycemic and hormonal hemostasis, anti-inflammatory, regulation of adipokine production and enhancement of endothelial function -3 PUFAs are a promising agent in relieving complications associated with PCOS. Although most of the studies in patients with PCOS reported an improvement in most complications after administration of omega-3 supplements, there is a distinct dearth of studies investigating the dietary intake of these types of fatty . Moreover, favorable effects regarding the improvement of dyslipidemia, regulation of adipokines, regulation of hormonal factors and enhancement of endothelial function are limited. Therefore, more trials are warranted to investigate palatable mechanisms for clarifying the  and hormonal effects of these agents in PCOS.Copyright © 2019 Salek et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336134>Lignans from Schisandra sphenanthera protect against lithocholic -induced cholestasis by pregnane X receptor activation in mice.</a></h1><p>Cholestasis is a clinical  caused by toxic bile  retention that will lead to serious liver diseases. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) and obeticholic  (OCA) are the only two FDA-approved drugs for its treatment. Thus, there is a clear need to develop new therapeutic approaches for cholestasis. Here, anti-cholestasis effects of the lignans from a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, Schisandra sphenanthera, were investigated as well as the involved mechanisms.Adult male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into 9 groups including the control group, LCA group, LCA with specific lignan treatment of Schisandrin A (SinA), Schisandrin B (SinB), Schisandrin C (SinC), Schisandrol A (SolA), Schisandrol B (SolB), Schisantherin A (StnA) and Schisantherin B (StnB), respectively. Mice were treated with each drug (qd) for 7 days, while the administration of lithocholic  (LCA) (bid) was launched from the 4th day. Twelve hours after the last LCA injection, mice were sacrificed and samples were collected. Serum biochemical measurement and histological analysis were conducted. Metabolomics analysis of serum, liver, intestine and feces were performed to study the  profile of bile . RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis were conducted to determine the hepatic expression of genes and proteins related to bile  homeostasis. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to investigate the transactivation effect of lignans on human pregnane X receptor (hPXR). RT-qPCR analysis was used to detect induction effects of lignans on hPXR-targeted genes in HepG2 cells.Lignans including SinA, SinB, SinC, SolA, SolB, StnA, StnB were found to significantly protect against LCA-induced intrahepatic cholestasis, as evidenced by significant decrease in liver necrosis, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. More importantly, serum total bile  (TBA) and total bilirubin (Tbili) were also significantly reduced. Metabolomics analysis revealed these lignans accelerated the metabolism of bile  and increased the bile  efflux from liver into the intestine or feces. Gene analysis revealed these lignans induced the hepatic expressions of PXR-target genes such as Cyp3a11 and Ugt1a1. Luciferase reporter gene assays illustrated that these bioactive lignans can activate hPXR. Additionally, they can all upregulate hPXR-regulate genes such as CYP3A4, UGT1A1 and OATP2.These results clearly demonstrated the lignans from Schisandra sphenanthera exert hepatoprotective effects against LCA-induced cholestasis by activation of PXR. These lignans may provide an effective approach for the prevention and treatment of cholestatic liver injury.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It's unknown whether long-term consumption of maleic -modified starch is harmful to the human. However, many studies have indicated that maleic  causes renal tubular damage in animal models, even as the associated pathways remain unclear. Sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH) is the most innovative of the label-free quantitative technologies, which have better quantification performance. Therefore, SWATH technology was used to investigate the effect of maleic  on rat kidney proteome in this study.SD rats were treated with 0 mg/kg (control), 6 mg/kg (low-dose), 10 mg/kg (medium-dose) and 60 mg/kg (high-dose) of maleic . After kidney protein extraction, 28% SDS-PAGE was used, followed by in-gel digestion and desalting. Next, the samples were analyzed with ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with Q-TOF MS, and data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and SWATH technology were also used. The gene ontology and pathway analysis were accomplished. Ultimately, these protein biomarkers were validated by using scheduled high-resolution multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM ).Comparisons of the control group with the other three groups revealed that 95, 130, and 103 proteins were expressed at significantly different levels from in the control group in the low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively. According to the gene ontology analysis, the major processes that these proteins were involved in were  processes, biological regulation, cellular processes, and responses to stimuli; the major functions these proteins were involved in were binding, hydrolase activity, catalytic activity, and oxidoreductase activity; and the major cellular components they were involved in were the cytoplasm, extracellular region, membrane, and mitochondria. According to the KEGG pathway analysis, these proteins were involved in 35 pathways, 5 of which, including the carbohydrate metabolism, folate biosynthesis, renal tubular resorption, amino  metabolism, and Ras signaling pathways, are discussed in this study. Ultimately, 19 proteins involved in 12 important pathways were validated by sMRM .It was demonstrated that maleic  caused insufficient energy production, which might lead to a decrease in the activity of the sodium-potassium ATP pump and hydrogen ion ATP pump, which could have in turn caused renal tubular resorption and hydrogen ion regulation to be blocked, thus leading to the accumulation of hydrogen ions in the renal tubules, which would then result in renal tubular acidification followed finally by Fanconi .This article is protected by copyright.

Supplementation of rumen-protected choline (RPC) has attracted major research efforts during the last decade, assuming that choline improves liver function by increasing very low-density lipoprotein exportation from the liver, thereby improving  profiles, milk production, and reproduction. However, the effects of RPC on production, health, and reproduction have been inconsistent. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of RPC supplementation, starting from d 20 (± 12.2) ante partum to d 53 (± 31.0) postpartum, on feed intake, milk production performance and  profiles of dairy cows early postpartum. Data analyses from 27 published studies showed an increase in postpartal dry matter intake (from on average 19.1 to 19.9 kg/d;  < 0.01) and milk yield (from on average 31.8 to 32.9 kg/d;  = 0.03) in cows receiving RPC. Milk fat yield and milk protein yield were also increased ( ≤ 0.05), without changing milk protein and fat contents. However, no interactive effects between cow's milk yield level and RPC-supplementation as well as no dose-dependent effects of RPC supplementation were observed. Supplementing the diet with RPC showed no effects on blood metabolites (non-esterified fatty , beta-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, and cholesterol), independent of the milk yield level of the cows. An effect on liver triacylglycerol contents, incidence of ketosis, and mastitis could not be confirmed across all studies included in this meta-analysis. Also, the positive effects of RPC supplementation on reproductive performance were not consistent findings. In conclusion, supplementing RPC in lactating dairy cows showed positive effects on dry matter intake which likely caused the improved milk yield. However, RPC supplementation did not improve the  health status of the cows. As several factors might be related to the responses to RPC, further research is needed to explore the precise mechanisms of RPC action in lactating cows, especially with regards to feed intake improvement and its related  health-promoting potential in early lactating dairy cows.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31344950>Association of Adherence to The Mediterranean Diet with Urinary Factors Favoring Renal Lithiasis: Cross-Sectional Study of Overweight Individuals with .</a></h1><p>Our purpose was to study the relationship of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) with urinary factors that favor the formation of renal calcium and uric  stones in overweight and obese participants who had . This cross-sectional study examined 267 participants. A well-known MedDiet score (range 0-9) was calculated for each patient, and patients were then categorized has having low (≤3), medium (4-5), or high (≥6) adherence to the MedDiet. Baseline characteristics and urinary parameters were also analyzed. High calcium salt urinary crystallization risk (CaUCR) and high uric  urinary crystallization risk (UrUCR) were calculated from urinary parameters using pre-defined criteria. More than half of patients with MedDiet scores ≤3 had high UrUCR (55.4%) and high CaUCR (53.8%). In contrast, fewer patients with high adherence (≥6) to the MedDiet had high UrUCR (41.2%) and high CaUCR (29.4%). Relative to those with low adherence, individuals with high adherence had a prevalence ratio (PR) of 0.77 for a high UrUCR (95% CI: 0.46-1.12; p for trend: 0.069) and a PR of 0.51 for a high CaUCR (95% CI: 0.26-0.87; p for trend: 0.012) after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, type 2 diabetes, and total energy intake. Our findings indicate that greater adherence to the MedDiet was associated with a reduced CaUCR and a reduced UrUCR. This suggests that adequate dietary management using the MedDiet patterns may prevent or reduce the incidence and recurrence of calcium salt and uric  renal stones.</p></html>
