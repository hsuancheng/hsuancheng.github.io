Because peroxisomes consume oxygen for H2O2 production and are induced by WY-14,643 treatment, it is possible that peroxisomal beta-oxidation can account for some of this increase in cellular respiration. Therefore, cyanide, an inhibitor of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase, was infused into livers of WY-14,643-fed rats (0.1% WY-14,643 in laboratory rat chow for 1, 21, and 105 days) to assess peroxisomal cyanide-insensitive respiration. As expected, the addition of cyanide abolished oxygen uptake nearly completely; however, after approximately 20 min oxygen consumption unexpectedly returned to basal levels in 105-day WY-14,643-treated animals but not in untreated controls. Urea synthesis, a process dependent upon ATP, was decreased and remained low during cyanide infusion in livers from both groups, indicating that mitochondria were not responsible for this unusual increase in oxygen uptake in the presence of cyanide. Methanol metabolism, which requires oxygen to form H2O2, was decreased from 37 +/- 5 to 6 +/- 1 micromol/g/hr in all groups treated with cyanide; however, it was increased significantly about 20 min later to 25 micromol/g/hr in livers from WY-14,643-treated rats, indicating that oxygen for peroxisomal H2O2 production is involved in cellular respiration in the presence of cyanide. Fasting abolished the recovery of both oxygen uptake and methanol metabolism in WY-14,643-fed rats, suggesting that ATP for acyl CoA synthetase, an enzyme which metabolizes fatty acids to acyl CoA compounds, is provided by . Indeed, oleate significantly increased methanol metabolism in fed control rats from 8 +/- 4 to 26 +/- 3 micromol/g/hr in the presence of cyanide, indicating that fatty  supply is necessary for peroxisomal respiration. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that when mitochondrial respiration is inhibited, livers from rats fed WY-14,643 chronically have the unique ability of metabolizing fatty acids through the peroxisome using glycolytic ATP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3114584>Effects of phorbol esters, A23187 and vasopressin on oleate metabolism in isolated rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Studies were conducted to compare the metabolic effects of vasopressin, 4 beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and A23187 on ketogenesis and oleate metabolism in isolated hepatocytes from fed rats. Vasopressin inhibited the formation of -soluble products from [1-14C]oleate (0.25 mM, 0.5 mM and 1 mM), the inhibition being most marked at low (0.25 mM) concentration of oleate. Conversion of [1-14C]oleate into 14CO2 and esterified products was stimulated by vasopressin. The stimulatory effect of this hormone on 14CO2 production was most marked at high (1 mM) concentration of oleate, whereas that on [1-14C]oleate esterification was most marked at low (0.25 mM) concentration of oleate. These vasopressin actions were abolished when hepatocytes were incubated in the absence of calcium in the medium. Our results strongly suggest that both increase in esterification and increase in oxidation to CO2 contribute to the anti-ketogenic action of vasopressin when oleate is added as substrate, although the relative extent of their contribution varies according to the oleate concentration. The anti-ketogenic action of vasopressin was mimicked by PMA but not by A23187. PMA also caused a stimulation of [1-14C]oleate esterification although the effect was diminished at 1 mM [1-14C]oleate. A23187 failed to affect [1-14C]oleate esterification. The metabolic effects of PMA were elicited in the absence of extracellular calcium, too. Conversion of [1-14C]oleate into 14CO2 was only slightly increased by both PMA and A23187 when 1 mM [1-14C]oleate was added as substrate. The marked stimulatory effect of vasopressin on 14CO2 production from [1-14C]oleate was not reproduced even by the combination of PMA and A23187.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17612624>Upregulation of cellular triacylglycerol - free fatty  cycling by oleate is associated with long-term serum-free survival of human breast cancer cells.</a></h2><p>We previously showed that exogenous oleate protects human breast cancer cells against palmitate-induced apoptosis in part by increasing esterification of this free fatty  (FFA) into triacylglycerol (TG). Here, we studied the mechanism whereby oleate protects these cells against apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal. The metabolism of FFA, TG, and glucose, in parallel with long-term cell survival in the absence of serum, was investigated in a panel of human breast cancer cell lines and in nontransformed MCF-10A cells after treatment with exogenous oleate. Short-term (3-24 h) exposure of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells to exogenous oleate resulted in a dose-dependent long-term (10 day) serum-free survival that correlated with the accumulation of TG in lipid droplets and with upregulation of lipolysis. Both effects persisted for several days after oleate removal. Rapid TG lipolysis and FFA re-esterification, supported by high rates of  that provide the glycerol backbone for TG synthesis, are consistent with the presence of very active TG-FFA cycling in human breast cancer cells. Only the cancer cell lines capable of accumulating TG showed long-term serum-free survival after oleate treatment. The results suggest that upregulation of TG-FFA cycling induced by oleate may be involved in maintenance of human breast cancer cell survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30028518>Multi-omics analysis points to altered platelet functions in severe food-associated respiratory allergy.</a></h2><p>Prevalence and severity of allergic diseases have increased worldwide. To date, respiratory allergy phenotypes are not fully characterized and, along with inflammation progression, treatment is increasingly complex and expensive. Profilin sensitization constitutes a good model to study the progression of allergic inflammation. Our aim was to identify the underlying mechanisms and the associated biomarkers of this progression, focusing on severe phenotypes, using transcriptomics and metabolomics.Twenty-five subjects were included in the study. Plasma samples were analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS and LC-MS, respectively). Individuals were classified in four groups-"nonallergic," "mild," "moderate," and "severe"-based on their clinical history, their response to an oral challenge test with profilin, and after a refinement using a mathematical metabolomic model. PBMCs were used for microarray analysis.We found a set of transcripts and metabolites that were specific for the "severe" phenotype. By metabolomics, a decrease in carbohydrates and pyruvate and an increase in lactate were detected, suggesting aerobic . Other metabolites were incremented in "severe" group: lysophospholipids, sphingosine-1-phosphate, sphinganine-1-phosphate, and lauric, myristic, palmitic, and  fatty acids. On the other hand, carnitines were decreased along severity. Significant transcripts in the "severe" group were found to be downregulated and were associated with platelet functions, protein synthesis, histone modification, and fatty  metabolism.We have found evidence that points to the association of severe allergic inflammation with platelet functions alteration, together with reduced protein synthesis, and switch of immune cells to aerobic .© 2018 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Weak organic acids in lignocellulosic hydrolysate can hamper the use of this renewable resource for fuel and chemical production. Plasma-membrane remodeling has recently been found to be involved in acquiring tolerance to organic acids, but the mechanisms responsible remain largely unknown. Therefore, it is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms of  tolerance of  for developing robust industrial strains.We have performed a comparative analysis of lipids and fatty acids in  grown in the presence of four different weak acids. The general response of the yeast to  stress was found to be the accumulation of triacylglycerols and the degradation of steryl esters. In addition, a decrease in phosphatidic , phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine, and an increase in phosphatidylinositol were observed. Loss of cardiolipin in the mitochondria membrane may be responsible for the dysfunction of mitochondria and the dramatic decrease in the rate of respiration of  under  stress. Interestingly, the accumulation of ergosterol was found to be a protective mechanism of yeast exposed to organic acids, and the  gene in ergosterol biosynthesis played a key in ergosterol-mediated  tolerance, as perturbing the expression of this gene caused rapid loss of viability. Interestingly, overexpressing  resulted in the increased levels of  (18:1n-9) and an increase in the unsaturation index of fatty acids in the plasma membrane, resulting in higher tolerance to acetic, formic and levulinic , while this change was found to be detrimental to cells exposed to lipophilic cinnamic .Comparison of lipid profiles revealed different remodeling of lipids, FAs and the unsaturation index of the FAs in the cell membrane in response of  to acetic, formic, levulinic and cinnamic , depending on the properties of the .

In cells from fed animals incubated without exogenous substrate, ATP level and ketone body production are higher in males (+25% and +100%) and lactate production is higher (+64%) in females; oleate enhances mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation in hepatocytes from fed male rats but not from fed females; in cells from starved animals oleate increases gluconeogenesis in both sexes at saturating levels of gluconeogenic substrates. However, at physiological levels (1 mM lactate and 0.1 mM pyruvate), this activation can only be detected in cells from males. In both sexes, oleate activation is abolished by adenosine which reduces in parallel the mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate; chloroadenosine, an A2-receptor agonist, increases glycogenolysis strongly in hepatocytes from male animals (+80%) but only very slightly in female cells (+12%).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28459558>Transcriptome Analysis of Genes Involved in Lipid Biosynthesis in the Developing Embryo of Pecan (Carya illinoinensis).</a></h2><p>Pecan (Carya illinoinensis) is an important woody tree species because of the high content of healthy oil in its nut. Thus far, the pathways and key genes related to oil biosynthesis in developing pecan seeds remain largely unclear. Our analyses revealed that mature pecan embryo accumulated more than 80% oil, in which 90% was unsaturated fatty acids with abundant . RNA sequencing generated 84,643 unigenes in three cDNA libraries prepared from pecan embryos collected at 105, 120, and 165 days after flowering (DAF). We identified 153 unigenes associated with lipid biosynthesis, including 107 unigenes for fatty  biosynthesis, 34 for triacylglycerol biosynthesis, 7 for oil bodies, and 5 for transcription factors involved in oil synthesis. The genes associated with fatty  synthesis were the most abundantly expressed genes at 120 DAF. Additionally, the biosynthesis of oil began to increase while crude fat contents increased from 16.61 to 74.45% (165 DAF). We identified four SAD, two FAD2, one FAD6, two FAD7, and two FAD8 unigenes responsible for unsaturated fatty  biosynthesis. However, FAD3 homologues were not detected. Consequently, we inferred that the linolenic  in developing pecan embryos is generated by FAD7 and FAD8 in plastids rather than FAD3 in endoplasmic reticula. During pecan embryo development, different unigenes are expressed for plastidial and cytosolic . Plastidial  is more relevant to lipid synthesis than cytosolic . The 18 most important genes associated with lipid biosynthesis were evaluated in five stages of developing embryos using quantitative PCR (qPCR). The qPCR data were well consistent with their expression in transcriptomic analyses. Our data would be important for the metabolic engineering of pecans to increase oil contents and modify fatty  composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1855245>Hydrodynamic and energetic aspects of exogenous free fatty  perfusion in the isolated rat heart during high flow anoxia and reoxygenation: a 31P magnetic resonance study.</a></h2><p>The aim was to show differences between the effects of various dietary long chain fatty acids (palmitic, , linoleic, alpha and gamma linolenic acids) perfused in isolated rat hearts subjected to a sequence of high flow anoxia and subsequent reoxygenation.Isolated working rat hearts perfused with selected exogenous fatty acids were allowed an initial 30 min equilibration period followed by 60 min of high flow anoxia and 40 min of reoxygenation. Ventricular function and tissue contents of phosphorylated metabolites were monitored concomitantly using standard procedures and 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy respectively.Hearts were removed from male Wistar rats weighing 350-400 g. Results from eight hearts were pooled for each of the five fatty acids perfused.High coronary flow maintained during anoxia led to an increased extracellular washout of lactate and only to mild intracellular acidosis, limiting myocardial damage by metabolites of anaerobic . Under these conditions, marked differences between the classes of perfused fatty acids were observed. Hearts which received  showed the most depressed ventricular function and a greater depletion in high energy phosphates content. These deleterious effects were completely reversed by the separate administration of two fatty  metabolism blocking agents, nicotinic  and oxfenicine. Cardioprotection was enhanced by perfusion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic , alpha and gamma linolenic acids). Hearts perfused either with glucose or with palmitic  behaved similarly and showed an intermediate functional and metabolic postanoxic recovery.This study documents the relation between the chemical structure of exogenous fatty acids used in heart perfusion and their ability to improve or impair postanoxic myocardial recovery. The cardioprotective effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids was documented by simultaneous evaluation of mechanical performance and metabolic response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6091151>Short-chain fatty  fermentation products of plant fiber affect glucose metabolism of isolated rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) produced during fermentation of plant fibers and absorbed from the colon may affect hepatic glucose metabolism.

Acetate, butyrate, and long-chain fatty acids significantly increased glucose production from lactate. However, propionate and valerate significantly decreased glucose production from lactate.

Consequently, investigations into the diagnosis, treatment and the basic metabolism of cancer cells have been directed by this perception. However, the data on cancer metabolism are equivocal, and in this study we have sought to clarify the issue. Using an innovative system we have measured the total ATP turnover of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, the contributions to this turnover by oxidative and glycolytic ATP production and the contributions to the oxidative component by glucose, lactate, glutamine, palmitate and oleate. The total ATP turnover over approx. 5 days was 26.8 micromol of ATP.10(7) cells(-1).h(-1). ATP production was 80% oxidative and 20% glycolytic. Contributions to the oxidative component were approx. 10% glucose, 14% glutamine, 7% palmitate, 4% oleate and 65% from unidentified sources. The contribution by glucose ( and oxidation) to total ATP turnover was 28.8%, glutamine contributed 10.7% and glucose and glutamine combined contributed 40%. Glucose and glutamine are significant fuels, but they account for less than half of the total ATP turnover. The contribution of aerobic  is not different from that in a variety of other non-transformed cell types.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25528561>Palmitoleic  (n-7) increases white adipocytes GLUT4 content and glucose uptake in association with AMPK activation.</a></h2><p>Palmitoleic  was previously shown to improve glucose homeostasis by reducing hepatic glucose production and by enhancing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Herein we tested the hypothesis that palmitoleic  positively modulates glucose uptake and metabolism in adipocytes.For this, both differentiated 3 T3-L1 cells treated with either palmitoleic  (16:1n7, 200 μM) or palmitic  (16:0, 200 μM) for 24 h and primary adipocytes from mice treated with 16:1n7 (300 mg/kg/day) or  (18:1n9, 300 mg/kg/day) by gavage for 10 days were evaluated for glucose uptake, oxidation, conversion to lactate and incorporation into fatty acids and glycerol components of TAG along with the activity and expression of lipogenic enzymes.Treatment of adipocytes with palmitoleic, but not  (in vivo) or palmitic (in vitro) acids, increased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 mRNA levels and protein content. Along with uptake, palmitoleic  enhanced glucose oxidation (aerobic ), conversion to lactate (anaerobic ) and incorporation into glycerol-TAG, but reduced de novo fatty  synthesis from glucose and acetate and the activity of lipogenic enzymes glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and ATP-citrate lyase. Importantly, palmitoleic  induction of adipocyte glucose uptake and metabolism were associated with AMPK activation as evidenced by the increased protein content of phospho(p)Thr172AMPKα, but no changes in pSer473Akt and pThr308Akt. Importantly, such increase in GLUT4 content induced by 16:1n7, was prevented by pharmacological inhibition of AMPK with compound C.In conclusion, palmitoleic  increases glucose uptake and the GLUT4 content in association with AMPK activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24040298>Inhibition of lipolysis by mercaptoacetate and etomoxir specifically sensitize drug-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cell to paclitaxel.</a></h2><p>Chemoresistance is a major cause of treatment failure in patients with lung cancer. Although the extensive efforts have been made in overcoming chemoresistance, the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. Cancer cells reprogram cellular metabolism to satisfy the demands of malignant phenotype. To reveal roles of cancer metabolism in regulating chemoresistance, we profiled the metabolic characteristics in paclitaxel-resistant lung cancer cells by flux assay. Glucose and oleate metabolism were significantly different between resistant and non-resistant cells. In addition, targeting metabolism as a strategy to overcome drug resistance was investigated using specific metabolic inhibitors. Inhibition of  and oxidative phosphorylation by 2-deoxyglucose and malonate, respectively, potentiated the effects of paclitaxel on nonresistant lung adenocarcinoma cells but not paclitaxel-resistant cells. By contrast, inhibition of lipolysis by mercaptoacetate or etomoxir synergistically inhibited drug-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation.

Exogenous phospholipase C inhibited ketogenesis in the presence of 0.5 mM oleate. Experiments employing [1-14C]oleate, however, indicated that the mechanism involved in the anti-ketogenic action of exogenous phospholipase C is distinct from that of vasopressin. The decreased rate of the production of -soluble products from [1-14C]oleate in response to vasopressin could be explained by the sum of the increased rates of 14CO2 formation and [1-14C]oleate esterification. By contrast, exogenous phospholipase C suppressed not only the formation of -soluble products but also 14CO2 production and [1-14C]oleate esterification. Indeed, phospholipase C greatly inhibited [1-14C]oleate uptake into hepatocytes. It is suggested that the alteration of the architecture of plasma membrane by exogenous phospholipase C may lead to the disturbance of oleate uptake and consequent general suppression of oleate metabolism. Exogenous phospholipase A2, arachidonic  and OAG increased ketogenesis regardless of the presence of oleate. The ketogenic effects may be attributed to the supply of fatty acids by these agents to hepatocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3778417>The role of fatty acids in ischemic tissue injury: difference between  and palmitic .</a></h2><p>Guinea pig hearts were subjected to low-flow perfusion (0.3 ml/g fresh weight/min) with an oxygen depleted perfusate.

However, few data are available regarding the effects of α-LA-OA on  metabolism. In this study, we measured glycolysis and mitochondrial functions in HeLa cells in response to α-LA-OA using the XF flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA). The gene expression of enzymes involved in glycolysis, tricarboxylic  cycle, electron transfer chain, and ATP synthesis were also evaluated. Our results show that α-LA-OA significantly enhanced the basal glycolysis and glycolytic capacity. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, including the basal respiration, maximal respiration, spare respiratory capacity and ATP production were also improved in response to α-LA-OA. The enhanced mitochondrial functions maybe partly due to the increased capacity of utilizing fatty acids and glutamine as the substrate. However, the gene expressions of pyruvate kinase M2, lactate dehydrogenase A, aconitate hydratase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 were inhibited, suggesting an insufficient ability for the glycolysis process and the tricarboxylic  cycle. The increased expression of acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2, a central enzyme involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids, would enhance the unbalance due to the decreased expression of electron transfer flavoprotein β subunit, which acts as the electron acceptor. These results indicated that α-LA-OA may induce oxidative stress due to conditions in which the ATP production is exceeding the  demand. Our results may help clarify the mechanism of apoptosis induced by reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial destruction.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

Our results indicate that palmitate inhibited  and lactate dehydrogenase fluxes while activating citric  cycle (CAC) flux and glutamine uptake. This decoupling of  and CAC fluxes occurred during the period following palmitate exposure but preceding the onset of apoptosis. Oleate co-treatment restored most fluxes to their control levels, resulting in steatotic lipid accumulation while preventing apoptosis. In addition, palmitate strongly increased the cytosolic NAD(+)/NADH ratio, whereas oleate co-treatment had the opposite effect on cellular redox. We next examined the influence of amino acids on these free fatty -induced phenotypic changes. Increased medium amino acids enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and apoptosis in PA-cells but not in PA/OA-cells. Overloading the medium with non-essential amino acids induced apoptosis, but essential amino  overloading partially ameliorated apoptosis. Glutamate was the most effective single amino  in promoting ROS. Amino  overloading also increased cellular palmitoyl-ceramide; however, ceramide synthesis inhibitors had no effect on measurable indicators of apoptosis.

Chronic exposure to either of the circulating fatty  oleate or palmitate has different effects on the beta-cell. Whereas palmitate causes functional impairment of the beta-cell and apoptosis, oleate has only minor negative effects on beta-cell function and mass. The aim of the present study was to delineate mechanisms by which the fatty acids affect the beta-cell differently. In particular, the aim was to identify beta-cell proteins exclusively regulated by palmitate. INS-1E cells were cultured for 24h in medium supplemented with palmitate or oleate. After culture, cells were lysed and subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Proteins specifically regulated by palmitate were excised from the gel and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using MALDI-TOF MS. Proteins exclusively regulated by palmitate were classified into proteins of carbohydrate or protein metabolism and Ca(2+) or mRNA binding proteins.

However, EEP and EEH significantly reduced  production by the biofilms and also inhibited the activity of F-ATPase (60-65%). Furthermore, both extracts significantly reduced the incidence of smooth surface caries in vivo without displaying a reduction of the percentage of S. sobriuns in the animals' plaque (P < 0.05). However, only EEH was able to reduce the incidence and severity of sulcal surface caries (P < 0.05). The data suggest that the cariostatic properties of propolis type 6 are related to its effect on  production and  tolerance of cariogenic streptococci; the biological activities may be attributed to its high content of fatty acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21871874>The effect of lipids on the enzymatic activity of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase from B. stearothermophilus.</a></h2><p>6-Phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1), a major regulatory enzyme in the  pathway, is a cytoplasmic enzyme with complicated allosteric kinetics. Here we investigate the effects of lipids on the activity of PFK from Bacillus stearothermophilus (BsPFK), to determine whether BsPFK shares any of the membrane binding or lipid binding properties reported for some mammalian PFKs. Our results show that large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) composed of either the phospholipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) or of 1:1 (mole ratio) DOPC and the fatty ,  (OA), cause a three-fold increase in V(max), depending on the lipid concentration and vesicle composition, but no change in K(m). Further studies show lipids do not reverse the allosteric inhibitory effects of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) on BsPFK. SDS/PAGE studies do not show significant binding of the BsPFK tetramer to the surface of the phospholipid vesicles, suggesting that modulation of catalytic activity is due to binding of lipid monomers. By simulating the kinetics of BsPFK interaction with vesicles and lipid monomers we conclude that the change in BsPFK catalytic activity with respect to lipid concentration is consistent with monomer abstraction from vesicles rather than direct uptake of lipid monomers from solution.Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The addition of extra glucose also increased the mRNA levels for these apos. Increased radioactivity was also found in these apolipoproteins by immunoprecipitation after metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine for 48 h. However, in a pulse-chase experiment (15 min labeling, 2 h chase), glucose was found to increase apoA-I synthesis but not apoB synthesis. More labeled apoB appeared in the medium during the chase because glucose inhibited its intracellular degradation. The effect of glucose on secretion of these apos could be mimicked by fructose and mannose but not by 6-deoxyglucose, showing that the hexoses must enter the cells and be phosphorylated. In contrast, the addition of 0.5 mM oleate had a weak inhibitory effect on secretion of apoA-I whereas it increased the secretion of apoB by more than twofold. The combination of 10 mM glucose and 0.5 mM oleate had no greater effect than glucose alone on apoA-I secretion but increased apoB secretion by fourfold. ii) Inhibiting  (by glucosamine) lowered secretion of both apoA-I and apoB, while inhibiting lipogenesis (using 8-Br-cyclic AMP or 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furancarboxylic  (TOFA)) did not affect apoA-I secretion but clearly decreased that of apoB. However, the inhibitory effect of TOFA on apoB secretion was much smaller in the presence of 0.5 mM oleate instead of extra glucose. Actinomycin-D and cycloheximide strongly suppressed the stimulatory effect of glucose on secretion of both apolipoproteins. Actinomycin-D also suppressed basal secretion of apoA-I but surprisingly stimulated that of apoB. These observations indicate that in HepG2 cells secretion of apoA-I is strongly dependent on ongoing protein synthesis and can be boosted by glucose, whereas that of apoB is primarily driven by internal (via lipogenesis from glucose) or external supply of fatty acyl-residues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564396>Assessment of the metabolic pathways associated with glucose-stimulated biphasic insulin secretion.</a></h2><p>Biphasic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion involves a rapid first phase followed by a prolonged second phase of insulin secretion. The biochemical pathways that control these 2 phases of insulin secretion are poorly defined. In this study, we used a gas chromatography mass spectroscopy-based metabolomics approach to perform a global analysis of cellular metabolism during biphasic insulin secretion. A time course metabolomic analysis of the clonal β-cell line 832/13 cells showed that glycolytic, tricarboxylic , pentose phosphate pathway, and several amino acids were strongly correlated to biphasic insulin secretion. Interestingly, first-phase insulin secretion was negatively associated with L-valine, trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline, trans-3-hydroxy-L-proline, DL-3-aminoisobutyric , L-glutamine, sarcosine, L-lysine, and thymine and positively with L-glutamic , flavin adenine dinucleotide, caprylic , uridine 5'-monophosphate, phosphoglycerate, myristic , capric , , linoleic , and palmitoleic . Tricarboxylic  cycle intermediates pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate, and succinate were positively associated with second-phase insulin secretion. Other metabolites such as myo-inositol, cholesterol, DL-3-aminobutyric , and L-norleucine were negatively associated metabolites with the second-phase of insulin secretion. These studies provide a detailed analysis of key metabolites that are either negatively or positively associated with biphasic insulin secretion. The insights provided by these data set create a framework for planning future studies in the assessment of the metabolic regulation of biphasic insulin secretion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11535127>Fatty  and amino  modulation of glucose cycling in isolated rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>We studied the influence of glucose/glucose 6-phosphate cycling on glycogen deposition from glucose in fasted-rat hepatocytes using S4048 and CP320626, specific inhibitors of glucose-6-phosphate translocase and glycogen phosphorylase respectively. The effect of amino acids and oleate was also examined. The following observations were made: (1) with glucose alone, net glycogen production was low. Inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate translocase increased intracellular glucose 6-phosphate (3-fold), glycogen accumulation (5-fold) without change in active (dephosphorylated) glycogen synthase (GSa) activity, and lactate production (4-fold). With both glucose 6-phosphate translocase and glycogen phosphorylase inhibited, glycogen deposition increased 8-fold and approached reported in vivo rates of glycogen deposition during the fasted-->fed transition. Addition of a physiological mixture of amino acids in the presence of glucose increased glycogen accumulation (4-fold) through activation of GS and inhibition of glucose-6-phosphatase flux. Addition of oleate with glucose present decreased glycolytic flux and increased the flux through glucose 6-phosphatase with no change in glycogen deposition. With glucose 6-phosphate translocase inhibited by S4048, oleate increased intracellular glucose 6-phosphate (3-fold) and net glycogen production (1.5-fold), without a major change in GSa activity. It is concluded that glucose cycling in hepatocytes prevents the net accumulation of glycogen from glucose. Amino acids activate GS and inhibit flux through glucose-6-phosphatase, while oleate inhibits  and stimulates glucose-6-phosphatase flux. Variation in glucose 6-phosphate does not always result in activity changes of GSa. Activation of glucose 6-phosphatase flux by fatty acids may contribute to the increased hepatic glucose production as seen in Type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7838147>Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids interfere with the insulin/glucose activation of L-type pyruvate kinase gene transcription.</a></h2><p>L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) is a key glycolytic enzyme regulating the flux of metabolites through the pyruvate-phosphoenolpyruvate cycle (1). The regulation of L-PK is complex involving both hormones and nutrients. We have found that feeding rats diets containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) significantly inhibits hepatic pyruvate kinase enzyme activity (> 60%) and suppresses mRNAPK abundance (> 70%). Studies with primary hepatocytes indicate that PUFA act directly on hepatocytes. Specifically, arachidonic (20:4, omega 6) and eicosapentaenoic (20:5, omega 3)  suppressed both mRNAPK llevels and the activity of a transfected PKCAT (-4300/+12) fusion gene by > 70%. This is due to an inhibition of the insulin/glucose-mediated transactivation of L-PKCAT. Deletion analysis localized PUFA-regulated cis-acting elements to a region within the L-PK proximal promoter, i.e. between -197 and -96 base pairs. This region binds two transcription factors involved in the hormone/nutrient regulation of L-PK gene transcription, i.e. a major late transcription factor-like factor and HNF-4. Linker scanning mutation analysis localized the PUFA-regulated cis-acting elements to the vicinity of the HNF-4 binding site. Thus, PUFA-regulated factors abrogate the insulin/glucose activation of L-PK gene transcription by targeting the HNF-4 elements. These studies suggest that PUFA may have significant effects on hepatic carbohydrate metabolism by inhibiting the L-PK side of the pyruvate-phosphoenolpyruvate cycle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29320411>Inihibition of Glycolysis by Using a Micro/Nano-Lipid Bromopyruvic Chitosan Carrier as a Promising Tool to Improve Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Glucose consumption in many types of cancer cells, in particular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), was followed completely by over-expression of type II hexokinase (HKII). This evidence has been used in modern pharmacotherapy to discover therapeutic target against glycolysis in cancer cells. Bromopyruvate (BrPA) exhibits antagonist property against HKII and can be used to inhibit glycolysis. However, the clinical application of BrPA is mostly combined with inhibition effect for healthy cells particularly erythrocytes. Our strategy is to encapsulate BrPA in a selected vehicle, without any leakage of BrPA out of vehicle in blood stream. This structure has been constructed from chitosan embedded into  layer and then coated by dual combination of folic  (FA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA). With FA as specific ligand for cancer folate receptor and BSA that can be an easy binding for hepatocytes, they can raise the potential selection of carrier system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26392817>Non-targeted metabolomics of  double-mutant cardiomyocytes reveals a novel role for SWI/SNF complexes in metabolic homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes utilize either BRG1 or  as alternative catalytic subunits to alter the position of nucleosomes and regulate gene expression. Genetic studies have demonstrated that SWI/SNF complexes are required during cardiac development and also protect against cardiovascular disease and cancer. However,  constitutive null mutants do not exhibit a cardiomyocyte phenotype and inducible  conditional mutations in cardiomyocyte do not demonstrate differences until stressed with transverse aortic constriction, where they exhibit a reduction in cardiac hypertrophy. We recently demonstrated the overlapping functions of  and  in vascular endothelial cells and sought here to test if this overlapping function occurred in cardiomyocytes.  double mutants died within 21 days of severe cardiac dysfunction associated with glycogen accumulation and mitochondrial defects based on histological and ultrastructural analyses. To determine the underlying defects, we performed nontargeted metabolomics analysis of cardiac tissue by GC/MS from a line of  double-mutant mice, which lack both  and  in cardiomyocytes in an inducible manner, and two groups of controls. Metabolites contributing most significantly to the differences between  double-mutant and control-group hearts were then determined using the variable importance in projection analysis. Increased cardiac linoleic  and  suggest alterations in fatty  utilization or intake are perturbed in  double mutants. Conversely, decreased glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, and myoinositol suggest that  and glycogen formation are impaired. These novel metabolomics findings provide insight into SWI/SNF-regulated metabolic pathways and will guide mechanistic studies evaluating the role of SWI/SNF complexes in homeostasis and cardiovascular disease prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21643007>Conserved features of cancer cells define their sensitivity to HAMLET-induced death; c-Myc and .</a></h2><p>HAMLET is the first member of a new family of tumoricidal protein-lipid complexes that kill cancer cells broadly, while sparing healthy, differentiated cells. Many and diverse tumor cell types are sensitive to the lethal effect, suggesting that HAMLET identifies and activates conserved death pathways in cancer cells. Here, we investigated the molecular basis for the difference in sensitivity between cancer cells and healthy cells. Using a combination of small-hairpin RNA (shRNA) inhibition, proteomic and metabolomic technology, we identified the c-Myc oncogene as one essential determinant of HAMLET sensitivity. Increased c-Myc expression levels promoted sensitivity to HAMLET and shRNA knockdown of c-Myc suppressed the lethal response, suggesting that oncogenic transformation with c-Myc creates a HAMLET-sensitive phenotype. Furthermore, HAMLET sensitivity was modified by the glycolytic state of tumor cells. Glucose deprivation sensitized tumor cells to HAMLET-induced cell death and in the shRNA screen, hexokinase 1 (HK1), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 1 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α modified HAMLET sensitivity. HK1 was shown to bind HAMLET in a protein array containing ∼8000 targets, and HK activity decreased within 15 min of HAMLET treatment, before morphological signs of tumor cell death. In parallel, HAMLET triggered rapid metabolic paralysis in carcinoma cells. Tumor cells were also shown to contain large amounts of  and its derivatives already after 15 min. The results identify HAMLET as a novel anti-cancer agent that kills tumor cells by exploiting unifying features of cancer cells such as oncogene addiction or the Warburg effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30602451>Minerval (2-hydroxyoleic ) causes cancer cell selective toxicity by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation and compromising bioenergetic compensation capacity.</a></h2><p>This work tests bioenergetic and cell-biological implications of the synthetic fatty  Minerval (2-hydroxyoleic ), previously demonstrated to act by activation of sphingomyelin synthase in the plasma membrane (PM) and lowering of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) and their carcinogenic signaling. We show here that Minerval also acts, selectively in cancer cell lines, as an ATP depleting uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). As a function of its exposure time, Minerval compromised the capacity of glioblastoma U87-MG cells to compensate for aberrant respiration by up-modulation of . This effect was not exposure time-dependent in the lung carcinoma A549 cell line, which was more sensitive to Minerval. Compared with OxPhos inhibitors FCCP (uncoupler), rotenone (electron transfer inhibitor), and oligomycin (F1F0-ATPase inhibitor), Minerval action was similar only to that of FCCP. This similarity was manifested by mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization, facilitation of oxygen consumption rate (OCR), restriction of mitochondrial and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial fragmentation. Additionally, compared with other OxPhos inhibitors, Minerval uniquely induced ER stress in cancer cell lines. These new modes of action for Minerval, capitalizing on the high fatty  requirements of cancer cells, can potentially enhance its cancer-selective toxicity and improve its therapeutic capacity.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4395181>The regulation of triglyceride synthesis and fatty  synthesis in rat epididymal adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>1. Adipose tissues from rats fed a balanced diet were incubated in the presence of glucose (20mm) with the following additions: insulin, anti-insulin serum, insulin+acetate, insulin+pyruvate, insulin+lactate, insulin+phenazine methosulphate, insulin+oleate+albumin, insulin+adrenaline+albumin, insulin+6-N-2'-O-dibutyryl 3':5'-cyclic AMP+albumin. 2. Measurements were made of the whole tissue concentrations of adenine nucleotides, hexose phosphates, triose phosphates, glycerol 1-phosphate, 3 phosphoglycerate, 6-phosphogluconate, long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, -soluble CoA, citrate, isocitrate, malate and 2-oxoglutarate, and of the release into the incubation medium of lactate, pyruvate and glycerol after 1h of incubation. 3. Fluxes of [(14)C]glucose carbon through the major pathways of glucose metabolism were calculated from the yields of (14)C in various products after 2h of incubation. Fluxes of [(14)C]acetate, [(14)C]pyruvate or [(14)C]lactate carbon in the presence of glucose were also determined. 4. Measurements were also made of the whole-tissue concentrations of metabolites in tissues taken directly from Nembutal-anaesthetized rats. 5. Whole tissue mass-action ratios for phosphofructokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase and the combined (aldolasextriose phosphate isomerase) reaction were similar in vivo and in vitro. The reactants of phosphofructokinase appeared to be far from mass-action equilibrium. In vitro, the reactants of hexokinase also appeared to be far from mass-action equilibrium. 6. Correlation of observed changes in glycolytic flux with changes in fructose 6-phosphate concentration suggested that phosphofructokinase may show regulatory behaviour. The enzyme appeared to be activated in the presence of oleate or adrenaline and to be inhibited in the presence of lactate or pyruvate. 7. Evidence is presented that the reactants of lactate dehydrogenase and glycerol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase may be near to mass-action equilibrium in the cytoplasm. 8. No satisfactory correlations could be drawn between the whole-tissue concentrations of long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, citrate and glycerol 1-phosphate and the observed rates of triglyceride and fatty  synthesis. Under the conditions employed, the concentration of glycerol 1-phosphate appeared to depend mainly on the cytoplasmic [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratios. 9. Calculated hexose monophosphate pathway flux rates roughly correlated with fatty  synthesis rates and with whole tissue [6-phosphogluconate]/[glucose 6-phosphate] ratios. The relative rates of production of NADPH for fatty  synthesis by the hexose monophosphate pathway and by the ;malic enzyme' are discussed. It is suggested that all NADH produced in the cytoplasm may be used in that compartment for reductive synthesis of fatty acids, lactate or glycerol 1-phosphate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8498503>Fatty acids are potent modulators of lactate utilization in isolated hepatocytes from fed rats.</a></h2><p>This work reports the roles of the concentration of lactate and of fatty acids on lactate uptake by liver cells isolated from fed or 24-h starved rats. Hepatocytes isolated from fed rats released lactate and pyruvate. The addition of lactate shifted the lactate balance from net release to net utilization, with a threshold at approximately 2 mM. Lactate favored its own utilization by 1) increasing the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (L/P) and 2) inhibiting hepatic . The addition of oleate to the cells elicited 1) a net reduction of the release of lactate and pyruvate in basal conditions, 2) a marked decrease in the threshold of lactate utilization, down to values close to 0.5 mM, and 3) an important stimulation of the utilization of lactate, at physiological concentrations of 2-3 mM. These changes in lactate utilization induced by oleate were accompanied by a parallel increase of the L/P. Oleate acted by decreasing the cellular concentrations of pyruvate. Such an effect was mediated by 1) an inhibition of  and 2) a rise in pyruvate utilization toward glucose. Moreover, it seems that the capacity of various fatty acids to stimulate lactate utilization depends on their rate of oxidation by the liver. In liver cells isolated from 24-h starved rats, in keeping with the activation of gluconeogenesis, lactate was utilized by hepatocytes even at low concentrations. Because of the low  and of the high utilization of pyruvate in these cells, the presence of oleate only induced a moderate increase of lactate utilization (+32%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9065785>Unsaturated fatty acids enhance cell yields and perturb the energy metabolism of an antibody-secreting hybridoma.</a></h2><p>Growth of the murine B-lymphocyte cell line CC9C10 and the myeloma SP2/0 was enhanced significantly by the presence of the unsaturated fatty acids,  and linoleic acids in serum-free culture. The cellular content of linoleic and  acids gradually increased during continuous culture passage, with no evidence of regulatory control. Over 10 culture passages in the presence of these fatty acids, the unsaturated/saturated fatty  ratio of all cellular lipid fractions increased substantially. Most of the fatty  accumulated in the polar lipid fraction (more than 74%) and only a small proportion was oxidized to CO2 (0.5%). Linoleic  caused a decrease to one-eighth in the rate of metabolism of glutamine and a 1.4-fold increase in the rate of metabolism of glucose. There was no change in the relative flux of glucose through the pathways of , pentose phosphate or the tricarboxylic  cycle. The changes in energy metabolism were reversed when the cells were removed from fatty -supplemented medium. The most plausible explanation for these effects is the observed decrease in the rate of uptake of glutamine into cells loaded with linoleic . Growth of the CC9C10 cells in linoleic  caused the Km of glutamine uptake to increase from 2.7 to 23 mM, whereas glucose uptake was unaffected.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6273686>Comparative studies on fatty  synthesis, glycogen metabolism, and gluconeogenesis by hepatocytes isolated from lean and obese Zucker rats.</a></h2><p>Hepatocytes isolated from genetically obese female Zucker rats and lean female Zucker rats were compared. Hepatocytes from fed obese rats exhibited greater rates of fatty  synthesis, more extensive accumulation of lactate and pyruvate from their glycogen stores, increased rates of net glucose utilization but produced less ketone bodies from exogenous fatty acids and had lower citrate levels than hepatocytes from lean rats. Lipogenesis was not as sensitive to dibutyryl cyclic AMP (DBcAMP) inhibition in hepatocytes from obese rats but glycogenolysis was stimulated to the same extent by this nucleotide in both preparations. Ketogenesis was less sensitive to stimulation by DBcAMP in hepatocytes from obese rats. A difference in sensitivity of lipogenesis to DBcAMP was not found when lactate plus pyruvate was added to the incubation medium, suggesting that a greater rate of  by hepatocytes from obese rats accounts for their relative insensitivity to DBcAMP. Citrate levels were elevated by DBcAMP to a greater extent in hepatocytes from obese rats. Hepatocytes prepared from lean rats starved for 48 hr were glycogen depleted and lacked significant capacity for lipogenesis and glycogen synthesis. In contrast, hepatocytes isolated from starved obese rats retained considerable amounts of liver glycogen and exhibited detectable rates of lipogenesis and glycogen synthesis. Hepatocytes prepared from starved lean rats gave faster apparent rates of lactate gluconeogenesis than hepatocytes prepared from starved obese rats. Thus, hepatocytes prepared from obese Zucker rats are more glycogenic, glycolytic, and lipogenic but less ketogenic and glucogenic than hepatocytes prepared from lean rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19635747>Lipid and protein accumulation in developing seeds of three lupine species: Lupinus luteus L., Lupinus albus L., and Lupinus mutabilis Sweet.</a></h2><p>A comparative study was carried out on the dynamics of lipid accumulation in developing seeds of three lupine species. Lupine seeds differ in lipid content; yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus L.) seeds contain about 6%, white lupine (Lupinus albus L.) 7-14%, and Andean lupine (Lupinus mutabilis Sweet) about 20% of lipids by dry mass. Cotyledons from developing seeds were isolated and cultured in vitro for 96 h on Heller medium with 60 mM sucrose (+S) or without sucrose (-S). Each medium was additionally enriched with 35 mM asparagine or 35 mM NaNO3. Asparagine caused an increase in protein accumulation and simultaneously decreased the lipid content, but nitrate increased accumulation of both protein and lipid. Experiments with [1-14C]acetate and [2-14C]acetate showed that the decrease in lipid accumulation in developing lupine seeds resulted from exhaustion of lipid precursors rather than from degradation or modification of the enzymatic apparatus. The carbon atom from the C-1 position of acetate was liberated mainly as CO2, whereas the carbon atom from the C-2 position was preferentially used in anabolic pathways. The dominant phospholipid in the investigated lupine seed storage organs was phosphatidylcholine. The main fatty  in yellow lupine cotyledons was linoleic , in white lupine it was , and in Andean lupine it was both linoleic and  acids.

Herein, we measured the oil content and fatty  compositions of high- and low-oil tea oil camellia seeds and investigated the global gene expression profiles by RNA-seq. The results showed that at the early, second and third seed developmental stages, a total of 64, 253, and 124 genes, respectively, were significantly differentially expressed between the high- and low-oil cultivars. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the identified differentially expressed transcription factors (TFs; ABI3, FUS3, LEC1, WRI1, TTG2 and DOF4.6) revealed some critical GO terms associated with oil biosynthesis and fatty  accumulation, including , zinc ion binding, positive regulation of fatty  biosynthetic process, triglyceride biosynthetic process, seed coat development, abscisic -mediated signaling pathway and embryo development. Comprehensive comparisons of transcriptomic profiles and expression analysis of multigenes based on qRT-PCR showed that coordinated high expression of the upstream genes ,  and  directly increased the relative levels of C16:0-ACP, which provided enough precursor resources for  biosynthesis. Continuous high expression of the  gene accelerated  synthesis and accumulation, and coordinated low expression of the downstream genes  and  decreased the consumption of  for conversion.

Treatment of erythrocytes with PLA2 induced a marked shape change (i.e., crenation) and significantly increased the rate of lactate production from glucose. Available evidence indicated that there is no relevance of this cell-shape change to the alteration of . The lack of a detectable effect of papain treatment on  in PLA2-treated cells suggested that the increase in  by PLA2 treatment might not be caused by the conformational change of band-3 protein through modulation of membrane phospholipids. The result of the measurement of lactate production in the presence and absence of ouabain did not support the idea that hydrolysis of phospholipids by PLA2 treatment makes plasma membranes leaky to Na+ and consequently enhances  through activation of Na+/K(+)-ATPase. The action of PLA2 on  was abolished by extraction of free fatty acids in the cell membrane with bovine serum albumin. Loading erythrocytes with free fatty  (, linoleic , or arachidonic ) caused a significant increase in . Analysis of glycolytic intermediates suggested that the enhancement of  was induced by activation of 6-phosphofructokinase. The data, thus, indicate that treatment of human erythrocytes with PLA2 significantly accelerates glucose utilization and suggest that the stimulation of  is caused by activation of 6-phosphofructokinase through liberation of free fatty acids of membrane phospholipids by PLA2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21327189>Tracking cellular metabolomics in lipoapoptosis- and steatosis-developing liver cells.</a></h2><p>Palmitate (PA) is known to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and apoptosis in liver cells, whereas concurrent treatment of oleate (OA) with PA predominately induces steatosis without ROS in liver cells. We previously reported that PA treatment induces the decoupling of  and tricarboxylic  cycle (TCA cycle) fluxes, but OA co-treatment restored most metabolic fluxes to their control levels. However, the mechanisms by which metabolites are linked to metabolic fluxes and subsequent lipoapoptotic or steatotic phenotypes remain unclear. To determine the link, we used GC-MS-based polar and non-polar metabolic profiling in lipoapoptosis- or steatosis-developing H4IIEC3 hepatoma cells, to examine the metabolome at different time points after treatment with either PA alone (PA cells) or both PA and OA (PA/OA cells). Metabolic profiles revealed various changes in metabolite levels for TCA cycle intermediates, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) intermediates, and energy storage metabolites between PA and PA/OA cells. For example, adenosine was markedly increased only in PA cells, whereas gluconate was increased in PA/OA cells. To assess the interaction among these metabolites, the metabolite-to-metabolite correlations were calculated and correlation networks were visualized. These correlation networks demonstrate that a dissociation among PPP metabolites was introduced in PA-treated cells, and this dissociation was restored in PA/OA-treated cells. Thus, our data suggest that abnormal PPP fluxes, in addition to increased adenosine levels, might be related to the decoupling of  and the resulting lipoapoptotic phenotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28223357>Lipid sensing by mTOR complexes via  synthesis of phosphatidic .</a></h2><p>mTOR, the mammalian target of rapamycin, integrates growth factor and nutrient signals to promote a transformation from catabolic to anabolic metabolism, cell growth, and cell cycle progression. Phosphatidic  (PA) interacts with the FK506-binding protein-12-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain of mTOR, which stabilizes both mTOR complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. We report here that mTORC1 and mTORC2 are activated in response to exogenously supplied fatty acids via the  synthesis of PA, a central metabolite for membrane phospholipid biosynthesis. We examined the impact of exogenously supplied fatty acids on mTOR in KRas-driven cancer cells, which are programmed to utilize exogenous lipids. The induction of mTOR by  was dependent upon the enzymes responsible for  synthesis of PA. Suppression of the  synthesis of PA resulted in G cell cycle arrest. Although it has long been appreciated that mTOR is a sensor of amino acids and glucose, this study reveals that mTOR also senses the presence of lipids via production of PA.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18590915>Cyclic GMP signaling in cardiomyocytes modulates fatty  trafficking and prevents triglyceride accumulation.</a></h2><p>While the balance between carbohydrates and fatty acids for energy production appears to be crucial for cardiac homeostasis, much remains to be learned about the molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship. Given the reported benefits of cGMP signaling on the myocardium, we investigated the impact of its chronic activation on cardiac energy metabolism using mice overexpressing a constitutively active cytoplasmic guanylate cyclase (GC(+/0)) in cardiomyocytes. Ex vivo working GC(+/0) heart perfusions with (13)C-labeled substrates revealed an altered pattern of exogenous substrate fuel selection compared to controls, namely a 38+/-9% lower contribution of exogenous fatty acids to acetyl-CoA formation, while that of carbohydrates remains unchanged despite a two-fold increase in . The lower contribution of exogenous fatty acids to energy production is not associated with changes in energy demand or supply (contractile function, oxygen consumption, tissue acetyl-CoA or CoA levels, citric  cycle flux rate) or in the regulation of beta-oxidation (acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, tissue malonyl-CoA levels). However, GC(+/0) hearts show a two-fold increase in the incorporation of exogenous oleate into triglycerides. Furthermore, the following molecular data are consistent with a concomitant increase in triglyceride hydrolysis: (i) increased abundance of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) protein (24+/-11%) and mRNA (22+/-4%) as well as (ii) several phosphorylation events related to HSL inhibitory (AMPK) and activation (ERK 1/2) sites, which should contribute to enhance its activity. These changes in exogenous fatty  trafficking in GC(+/0) hearts appear to be functionally relevant, as demonstrated by their resistance to fasting-induced triglyceride accumulation. While the documented metabolic profile of GC(+/0) mouse hearts is partly reminiscent of hypertrophied hearts, the observed changes in lipid trafficking have not been previously documented, and may be part of the molecular mechanism underlying the benefits of cGMP signaling on the myocardium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6477518>Influence of oleate oxidation on pyruvate production and utilization in hepatocytes isolated from fed rats. Effect of 2-[5-(4-chlorophenyl)pentyl]oxiran-2-carboxylate.</a></h2><p>Oleate (0.35 and 1.5 mM) decreases, in a concentration-dependent manner, lactate and pyruvate concentrations in hepatocytes, isolated from fed rats, incubated without exogenous substrate. The glycolytic flux, estimated at 18 mM-glucose by [6-3H]-glucose detritiation and apparent production of lactate and pyruvate, is decreased by oleate. The measurement of glycolytic intermediates shows a cross-over at the phosphofructokinase level, which might result from an increased citrate concentration. All those effects are dependent on oleate oxidation in mitochondria, since they are suppressed by 1 microM-2-[5-(4-chlorophenyl)pentyl]oxiran-2-carboxylate (POCA), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial entry of oleate, but not of its uptake by hepatocytes. The decrease of lactate and pyruvate also results from an oleate-induced enhancement of pyruvate utilization by hepatocytes, as shown by the increase of 14CO2 formation from [1-14C]- and [3-14C]-pyruvate, especially at low (0.4 mM) pyruvate concentration. Those oleate effects are also suppressed by POCA. They might be due to an enhanced flux through pyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate dehydrogenase, as a result of an oleate-induced increase in the mitochondrial concentrations of pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. Thus oleate oxidation inhibits production of lactate and pyruvate in fed-rat hepatocytes, as it does in other tissues. But, in the liver, it also enhances the mitochondrial utilization of pyruvate. The physiological implications of those findings are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27303373>Microbiome-Metabolome Responses in the Cecum and Colon of Pig to a High Resistant Starch Diet.</a></h2><p>Currently, knowledge about the impact of long-term intake of high resistant starch diet on pig hindgut microbiota and metabolite profile is limited. In this study, a combination of the pyrosequencing and the mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics techniques were used to investigate the effects of a raw potato starch (RPS, high in resistant starch) diet on microbial composition and microbial metabolites in the hindgut of pig. The results showed that Coprococcus, Ruminococcus, and Turicibacter increased significantly, while Sarcina and Clostridium decreased in relative abundances in the hindgut of pigs fed RPS. The metabolimic analysis revealed that RPS significantly affected starch and sucrose metabolites, amino  turnover or protein biosynthesis, lipid metabolites, , the pentose phosphate pathway, inositol phosphate metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism. Furthermore, a Pearson's correlation analysis showed that Ruminococcus and Coprococcus were positively correlated with glucose-6-phosphate, maltose, arachidonic , 9, 12-octadecadienoic , , phosphate, but negatively correlated with α-aminobutyric . However, the correlation of Clostridium and Sarcina with these compounds was in the opposite direction. The results suggest that RPS not only alters the composition of the gut microbial community but also modulates the metabolic pathway of microbial metabolism, which may further affect the hindgut health of the host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24414069>Beneficial effects of acute inhibition of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in the failing heart.</a></h2><p>In vitro studies suggested that glucose metabolism through the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP) can paradoxically feed superoxide-generating enzymes in failing hearts. We therefore tested the hypothesis that acute inhibition of the oxPPP reduces oxidative stress and enhances function and metabolism of the failing heart, in vivo. In 10 chronically instrumented dogs, congestive heart failure (HF) was induced by high-frequency cardiac pacing. Myocardial glucose consumption was enhanced by raising arterial glycemia to levels mimicking postprandial peaks, before and after intravenous administration of the oxPPP inhibitor 6-aminonicotinamide (80 mg/kg). Myocardial energy substrate metabolism was measured with radiolabeled glucose and , and cardiac 8-isoprostane output was used as an index of oxidative stress. A group of five chronically instrumented, normal dogs served as control. In HF, raising glycemic levels from ∼ 80 to ∼ 170 mg/dL increased cardiac isoprostane output by approximately twofold, whereas oxPPP inhibition normalized oxidative stress and enhanced cardiac oxygen consumption, glucose oxidation, and stroke work. In normal hearts glucose infusion did not induce significant changes in cardiac oxidative stress. Myocardial tissue concentration of 6P-gluconate, an intermediate metabolite of the oxPPP, was significantly reduced by ∼ 50% in treated versus nontreated failing hearts, supporting the inhibitory effect of 6-aminonicotinamide. Our study indicates an important contribution of the oxPPP activity to cardiac oxidative stress in HF, which is particularly pronounced during common physiological changes such as postprandial glycemic peaks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2316646>Glucose is required to maintain ATP/ADP ratio of isolated bovine cerebral microvessels.</a></h2><p>Isolated bovine cerebral microvessels (ICMV) were incubated with different metabolic fuels to determine the effect of each of them on microvessel energy state. With no fuel added to the medium, the ATP/ADP generally decreased from initial values of 1.5-3 down to 1-1.5 over 4 h; the ATP content also declined approximately 50%. In contrast, with glucose present, the ATP/ADP increased, and the ATP content was maintained. Pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, glutamate, and oleate were ineffective; oleate added together with carnitine gave some improvement but less than with glucose. Oxygen consumption by ICMV did not differ appreciably in fuel-free or glucose-containing medium. Addition of an inhibitor of fatty  oxidation, 2-tetradecylglycidate, depressed the ATP/ADP. These results suggest that ICMV require  to maintain both their content of ATP and their ATP/ADP. They also suggest that endogenous lipid is an important fuel for isolated microvessels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29146491>Respiratory stress in mitochondrial electron transport chain complex mutants of Candida albicans activates Snf1 kinase response.</a></h2><p>We have previously established that mitochondrial Complex I (CI) mutants of Candida albicans display reduced oxygen consumption, decreased ATP production, and increased reactive oxidant species (ROS) during cell growth. Using the Seahorse XF96 analyzer, the energetic phenotypes of Electron Transport Chain (ETC) complex mutants are further characterized in the current study. The underlying regulation of energetic changes in these mutants is determined in glucose and non-glucose conditions when compared to wild type (WT) cells. In parental cells, the rate of oxygen consumption remains constant for 2.5 h following the addition of glucose, oligomycin, and 2-DG, but glycolysis is highly active upon the addition of glucose. In comparison, over the same time period, electron transport complex mutants (CI, CIII and CIV) have heightened activities in both oxygen consumption and glycolysis upon glucose uptake. We refer to the response in these mutants as an "explosive respiration," which we believe is caused by low  levels and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Accompanying this phenotype in mutants is a hyperphosphorylation of Snf1p which in Saccharomyces cerevisiae serves as an energetic stress response protein kinase for maintaining  homeostasis. Compared to wild type cells, a 2.9- to 4.4-fold hyperphosphorylation of Snf1p is observed in all ETC mutants in the presence of glucose. However, the explosive respiration and hyperphosphorylation of Snf1 can be partially reduced by the replacement of glucose with either glycerol or  in a mutant-specific manner. Furthermore, Inhibitors of glutathione synthesis (BSO) or anti-oxidants (mito-TEMPO) likewise confirmed an increase of Sfn1 phosphorylation in WT or mutant due to increased levels of ROS. Our data establish the role of the C. albicans Snf1 as a surveyor of cell  and ROS levels. We interpret the "explosive respiration" as a failed attempt by ETC mutants to restore  and ROS homeostasis via Snf1 activation. An inherently high OCR baseline in WT C. albicans with a background level of Snf1 activation is a prerequisite for success in quickly fermenting glucose.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Stimulation of oxygen consumption, ketogenesis and CO2 production following addition of octanoate and oleate in perfused rat liver.</a></h2><p>Changes in metabolic rates (oxygen consumption, ketogenesis, 14CO2 production from labelled fatty acids, ) following the addition of octanoate or oleate were studied in isolated livers from fed and starved rats perfused with Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer in a non-recirculating system. The following results were obtained. The infusion of fatty acids caused a large increase in the rate of oxygen consumption. The effect was greater with octanoate than with oleate and was half-maximal with fatty  concentrations (free plus albumin bound) around 0.1 mM. The effects of oleate were only partially suppressed when the perfusate contained albumin concentrations near the physiological range. When fatty acids were oxidized at high rates, the glycolytic rate was diminished by 50%. The increase in oxygen consumption could not be explained fully by the increased ATP demand for fatty  metabolism or by a compensation for the diminished extramitochondrial ATP generation. In the presence of phenylalkyl oxirane carboxylic , an inhibitor of the transport of long-chain acyl-CoA derivates into the mitochondria, ketogenesis and 14CO2 production from labelled oleate were strongly inhibited, whereas the increase in oxygen consumption was only slightly affected. In the presence of antimycin A, the increase in oxygen consumption due to fatty acids was totally abolished. Following pretreatment of rats with ciprofibrate (induction of enzymes for peroxisomal beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids), ketogenesis (but not 14CO2 production) from oleate was enhanced threefold. The increase in oxygen consumption, however, was not affected. In conclusion, the increase in hepatic oxygen consumption due to addition of fatty acids reflects a mitochondrial process; it is, in part, independent of the ATP demand of the cell. An uncoupling-like effect of fatty acids on the respiratory chain and its possible physiological significance in ketogenesis are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11292656>Metabolic adaptations in skeletal muscle overexpressing GLUT4: effects on muscle and physical activity.</a></h2><p>To understand the long-term metabolic and functional consequences of increased GLUT4 content, intracellular substrate utilization was investigated in isolated muscles of transgenic mice overexpressing GLUT4 selectively in fast-twitch skeletal muscles. Rates of , glycogen synthesis, glucose oxidation, and free fatty  (FFA) oxidation as well as glycogen content were assessed in isolated EDL (fast-twitch) and soleus (slow-twitch) muscles from female and male MLC-GLUT4 transgenic and control mice. In male MLC-GLUT4 EDL, increased glucose influx predominantly led to increased . In contrast, in female MLC-GLUT4 EDL increased glycogen synthesis was observed. In both sexes, GLUT4 overexpression resulted in decreased exogenous FFA oxidation rates. The decreased rate of FFA oxidation in male MLC-GLUT4 EDL was associated with increased lipid content in liver, but not in muscle or at the whole body level. To determine how changes in substrate metabolism and insulin action may influence energy balance in an environment that encouraged physical activity, we measured voluntary training activity, body weight, and food consumption of MLC-GLUT4 and control mice in cages equipped with training wheels. We observed a small decrease in body weight of MLC-GLUT4 mice that was paradoxically accompanied by a 45% increase in food consumption. The results were explained by a marked fourfold increase in voluntary wheel exercise. The changes in substrate metabolism and physical activity in MLC-GLUT4 mice were not associated with dramatic changes in skeletal muscle morphology. Collectively, results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of altering muscle substrate utilization by overexpression of GLUT4. The results also suggest that as a potential treatment for type II diabetes mellitus, increased skeletal muscle GLUT4 expression may provide benefits in addition to improvement of insulin action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10818268>The muscle fatty  binding protein of spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii).</a></h2><p>Fatty  binding protein was purified from skeletal muscle of the spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii), an estivating species. While estivating, this animal relies on the fatty  oxidation for energy. Hence we were interested in the behaviour of fatty  binding protein under conditions of elevated urea (up to 200 mM) and potassium chloride such as exist during estivation. Also we examined whether there were interactions between glycolytic intermediates and the binding ability of the protein. The amount of bound fatty  (a fluorescence assay using cis-parinarate) was not affected (P < 0.05) by glucose, fructose 6-phosphate or phosphoenolpyruvate at physiological concentrations. By contrast, glucose 6-phosphate increased the amount of bound cis-parinarate but the apparent dissociation constant was not different from the control. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate but not fructose 2,6-phosphate decreased cis-parinarate binding by 40%, commensurate with doubling the apparent dissociation constant (1.15-2.62 microM). Urea, guanidinium and trimethylamine N-oxide at 200 mM increased cis-parinarate binding 60% over controls. Urea (1 M) and KCl (200 mM) did not affect cis-parinarate binding compared to controls. The interaction of this fatty  transporter with fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is discussed in terms of reciprocal interaction with phosphofructokinase since fatty  is also an inhibitor of phosphofructokinase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27836699>The mitochondria-targeted imidazole substituted  'TPP-IOA' affects mitochondrial bioenergetics and its protective efficacy in cells is influenced by cellular dependence on aerobic metabolism.</a></h2><p>A variety of mitochondria-targeted small molecules have been invented to manipulate mitochondrial redox activities and improve function in certain disease states. 3-Hydroxypropyl-triphenylphosphonium-conjugated imidazole-substituted  (TPP-IOA) was developed as a specific inhibitor of cytochrome c peroxidase activity that inhibits apoptosis by preventing cardiolipin oxidation and cytochrome c release to the cytosol. Here we evaluate the effects of TPP-IOA on oxidative phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria and on mitochondrial function in live cells. We demonstrate that, at concentrations similar to those required to achieve inhibition of cytochrome c peroxidase activity, TPP-IOA perturbs oxidative phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria. In live SH-SY5Y cells, TPP-IOA partially collapsed mitochondrial membrane potential, caused extensive fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, and decreased apparent mitochondrial abundance within 3h of exposure. Many cultured cell lines rely primarily on aerobic , potentially making them less sensitive to small molecules disrupting oxidative phosphorylation. We therefore determined the anti-apoptotic efficacy of TPP-IOA in SH-SY5Y cells growing in glucose or in galactose, the latter of which increases reliance on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP supply. The anti-apoptotic activity of TPP-IOA that was observed in glucose media was not seen in galactose media. It therefore appears that, at concentrations required to inhibit cytochrome c peroxidase activity, TPP-IOA perturbs oxidative phosphorylation. In light of these data it is predicted that potential future therapeutic applications of TPP-IOA will be restricted to highly glycolytic cell types with limited reliance on oxidative phosphorylation.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Acetyl-CoA, the fundamental building block of all known fungal polyketides, is generated by a large number of biochemical pathways, including beta-oxidation of fatty acids and  of sugars. We present several lines of evidence to support a major role for seed fatty acids in formation of AF and ST in A. flavus, A. parasiticus, and A. nidulans. Aspergillus strains exhibiting canonical signs of -induced peroxisome proliferation, including increased catalase activity, beta-oxidation gene expression, and peroxisomal clustering, also exhibited a marked increase in toxin gene expression and biosynthesis. Furthermore, microscopic observations showed that the ST and AF precursor norsolorinic  accumulated in peroxisomes of all three Aspergilli. While a peroxisomal beta-oxidation mutation eliminated -induced increases in ST in A. nidulans, a mitochondrial beta-oxidation mutation played a larger role in eliminating ST formation on oatmeal medium and on live corn kernels, implicating a fundamental role for both peroxisomal and mitochondrial beta-oxidation in toxin production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29345287>Intermittent calorie restriction enhances epithelial-mesenchymal transition through the alteration of  metabolism in a mouse tumor model.</a></h2><p>The effect of intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) on cancer is controversial. In this study, we examined the effects of ICR and food content in syngeneic BALB/c mice injected with CT26 mouse colon cancer cells. Mice were subjected to 24-h fasting once a week for 4 weeks, and then provided with a control, high-calorie, or trans fatty -rich diet. While ICR resulted in increases in tumor weights, metastasis and in the number of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in the tumors or blood of mice fed the control and high-fat diets, it had no effect on body weight after 4 weeks. In particular, we detected increases in the numbers of CSCs in the tumor or blood on the day after starvation, when food overconsumption was detected. Conversely, continuous calorie restriction had no effect on tumor weight, metastasis, or the number of CSCs in tumors or blood. In the post-starvation period,  metabolism in the tumor was altered from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis/lactate fermentation, with the acquisition of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. Hyperglycemia at the post-starvation period induced the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1, hypoxia-induced factor-1α and Nanog, as well as the phosphorylation of Stat3. Taken together, these findings suggest that ICR induces an increase in the number of CSCs and enhances EMT by promoting the Warburg/Crabtree effect following post-fasting food overconsumption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8135535>Importance of the modulation of  in the control of lactate metabolism by fatty acids in isolated hepatocytes from fed rats.</a></h2><p>In liver cells from fed rats, lactate utilization depends on its extracellular concentration and the threshold concentration at which lactate uptake equilibrates release is about 3 mM. Even-chain fatty acids (butyrate, octanoate, or oleate) played a crucial role (i) to depress the lactate release, from 40% (butyrate or oleate) to 72% (octanoate), and (ii) to lower the threshold concentration for lactate utilization (down to 1 mM with octanoate). The effects of fatty acids were connected to their inhibition of hepatic , estimated by the detritiation of [6-3H]glucose (about -30% with butyrate or oleate and -45% with octanoate). Fatty acids depressed the cellular concentration of pyruvate which, at physiological concentration of lactate, favors its utilization. The rise in ketone bodies concentration in response to fatty acids reflected an enhanced acetyl CoA production, resulting in an accumulation of citrate. In parallel there was a drop of the cellular concentration of fructose 2,6-biphosphate. As a result, there was an inhibition of the flux through 6-phosphofructo-1 kinase (50, 75, or 40% inhibition with butyrate, octanoate, or oleate, respectively). The other regulatory  steps, catalyzed by glucokinase and pyruvate kinase, were not affected by fatty acids. Inhibition of hepatic  by fatty acids seems connected to acetyl-CoA generation since octanoate, readily metabolized to acetyl-CoA and ketone bodies by hepatocytes, had a more potent stimulatory effect on the hepatic uptake of lactate than butyrate or oleate. Propionate, which yields practically no acetyl CoA, slightly stimulated lactate release and elevated the threshold of lactate utilization. The present data suggest thus that, in hepatocytes from fed rats, fatty acids effectively inhibit  and switch liver cell metabolism toward gluconeogenic conditions, which promotes lactate utilization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4668964>Effect of free fatty  on myocardial function during hypoxia.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26892511> stimulates glucagon-like peptide-1 release from enteroendocrine cells by modulating cell respiration and .</a></h2><p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a potent satiating and incretin hormone released by enteroendocrine L-cells in response to eating. Dietary fat, in particular monounsaturated fatty acids, such as  (OA), potently stimulates GLP-1 secretion from L-cells. It is, however, unclear whether the intracellular metabolic handling of OA is involved in this effect.First we determined the optimal medium for the bioenergetics measurements. Then we examined the effect of OA on the metabolism of the immortalized enteroendocrine GLUTag cell model and assessed GLP-1 release in parallel. We measured oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate in response to OA and to different metabolic inhibitors with the Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer.OA increased cellular respiration and potently stimulated GLP-1 release. The fatty  oxidation inhibitor etomoxir did neither reduce OA-induced respiration nor affect the OA-induced GLP-1 release. In contrast, inhibition of the respiratory chain or of downstream steps of aerobic  reduced the OA-induced GLP-1 release, and an inhibition of the first step of  by addition of 2-deoxy-d-glucose even abolished it.These findings indicate that an indirect stimulation of  is crucial for the OA-induced release of GLP-1.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The comprehension of controls for carbon partitioning and oil accumulation in nonseed tissues is essential to generate oil-rich biomass in perennial bioenergy crops. Persea americana (avocado), a basal angiosperm with unique features that are ancestral to most flowering plants, stores ~ 70 % TAG per dry weight in its mesocarp, a nonseed tissue. Transcriptome analyses of select pathways, from generation of pyruvate and leading up to TAG accumulation, in mesocarp tissues of avocado was conducted and compared with that of oil-rich monocot (oil palm) and dicot (rapeseed and castor) tissues to identify tissue- and species-specific regulation and biosynthesis of TAG in plants.RNA-Seq analyses of select lipid metabolic pathways of avocado mesocarp revealed patterns similar to that of other oil-rich species. However, only some predominant orthologs of the fatty  biosynthetic pathway genes in this basal angiosperm were similar to those of monocots and dicots. The accumulation of TAG, rich in , was associated with higher transcript levels for a putative stearoyl-ACP desaturase and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated acyl-CoA synthetases, during fruit development. Gene expression levels for enzymes involved in terminal steps to TAG biosynthesis in the ER further indicated that both acyl-CoA-dependent and -independent mechanisms might play a role in TAG assembly, depending on the developmental stage of the fruit. Furthermore, in addition to the expression of an ortholog of WRINKLED1 (WRI1), a regulator of fatty  biosynthesis, high transcript levels for WRI2-like and WRI3-like suggest a role for additional transcription factors in nonseed oil accumulation. Plastid pyruvate necessary for fatty  synthesis is likely driven by the upregulation of genes involved in  and transport of its intermediates. Together, a comparative transcriptome analyses for storage oil biosynthesis in diverse plants and tissues suggested that several distinct and conserved features in this basal angiosperm species might contribute towards its rich TAG content.Our work represents a comprehensive transcriptome resource for a basal angiosperm species and provides insight into their lipid metabolism in mesocarp tissues. Furthermore, comparison of the transcriptome of oil-rich mesocarp of avocado, with oil-rich seed and nonseed tissues of monocot and dicot species, revealed lipid gene orthologs that are highly conserved during evolution. The orthologs that are distinctively expressed in oil-rich mesocarp tissues of this basal angiosperm, such as WRI2, ER-associated acyl-CoA synthetases, and lipid-droplet associated proteins were also identified.

To present a system-level understanding of erythromycin stress and degradation, proteome, phospholipids and membrane potentials were investigated after the erythromycin degradation. Bacillus thuringiensis could effectively remove 77% and degrade 53% of 1 µM erythromycin within 24 h. The 36 up-regulated and 22 down-regulated proteins were mainly involved in spore germination, chaperone and nucleic  binding. Up-regulated ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase and ribosomal proteins confirmed that the synthesis of protein, DNA and RNA were enhanced after the erythromycin degradation. The reaction network of /gluconeogenesis was activated, whereas, the activity of spore germination was decreased. The increased synthesis of phospholipids, especially, palmitoleic  and , altered the membrane permeability for erythromycin transport. Ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase and palmitoleic  could be biomarkers to reflect erythromycin exposure. Lipids, disease, pyruvate metabolism and citrate cycle in human cells could be the target pathways influenced by erythromycin.

Lambs were blocked by BW and allocated to alfalfa paddocks (2 lambs/paddock and 3 paddocks/treatment). Each paddock within a block was assigned randomly to drinking water treatments for 30 d: 1) control (CON), 2) 120 g fructose/L of drinking water (FRU), or 3) 120 g glycerol/L of drinking water (GLY). Lambs grazed alfalfa with free access to water treatments for 28 d and then were fasted in indoor pens for a final 2 d with access to only water treatments. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS with water treatment and time (when appropriate) in the model. During the 28-d grazing period, ADG was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY than for CON or FRU. During the 2-d fasting period, BW shrink was lower ( < 0.05) for GLY compared with CON or FRU. Hot carcass weight was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY than for FRU. The interaction for glycogen content × postmortem time was significant ( = 0.003) in LM and semitendinosus (ST) muscles. Glycogen content in the LM was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY at 2 and 3 h and for FRU at 1 h postmortem compared with CON. Glycogen content in ST did not differ between treatments ( > 0.05). Liver glycogen content was over 14-fold greater ( < 0.05) for GLY compared with FRU or CON. Liver free glucose was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY than for CON, whereas liver lipid content was higher ( < 0.05) for CON than for GLY. Supplementation with GLY increased ( < 0.05) odd-chain fatty acids in LM, subcutaneous fat (SQ), and the liver. Stearic  (C18:0) concentrations were reduced in LM ( = 0.064) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SQ; = 0.018), whereas  (C18:1 -9) concentration tended to be increased ( = 0.066) in SQ with FRU and GLY.

It was hypothesized that NO2-FA would impact mitochondrial redox reactions to induce tissue-protective metabolic shifts in cells. Nitro- (OA-NO2) reversibly inhibited complex II-linked respiration in isolated rat heart mitochondria in a pH-dependent manner and suppressed superoxide formation. Nitroalkylation of Fp subunit was determined by BME capture and the site of modification by OA-NO2 defined by mass spectrometric analysis. These effects translated into reduced basal and maximal respiration and favored glycolytic metabolism in H9C2 cardiomyoblasts as assessed by extracellular H(+) and O2 flux analysis. The perfusion of NO2-FA induced acute cardioprotection in an isolated perfused heart ischemia/reperfusion (IR) model as evidenced by significantly higher rate-pressure products. Together these findings indicate that NO2-FA can promote cardioprotection by inducing a shift from respiration to  and suppressing reactive species formation in the post-ischemic interval.Copyright © 2015.

The activity of hexokinase in the macrophage is very high, as high as that in any other major tissue of the body, and higher than that of phosphorylase or 6-phosphofructokinase, suggesting that glucose is a more important fuel than glycogen and that the pentose phosphate pathway is also important in these cells. The latter suggestion is supported by the high activities of both glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. However, the rate of glucose utilization by 'resting' macrophages incubated in vitro is less than the 10% of the activity of 6-phosphofructokinase: this suggests that the rate of  is increased dramatically during phagocytosis or increased secretory activity. The macrophages possess higher activities of citrate synthase and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase than do lymphocytes, suggesting that the tricarboxylic  cycle may be important in energy generation in these cells. The activity of 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase is higher in the macrophage, but that of 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase is very much lower than those in the lymphocytes. The activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase is higher in macrophages, suggesting that fatty acids as well as acetoacetate could provide acetyl-CoA as substrate for the tricarboxylic  cycle. No detectable rate of acetoacetate or 3-hydroxybutyrate utilization was observed during incubation of resting macrophages, but that of oleate was 1.0 nmol/h per mg of protein or about 2.2% of the activity of palmitoyltransferase. The activity of glutaminase is about 4-fold higher in macrophages than in lymphocytes, which suggests that the rate of glutamine utilization could be very high. The rate of utilization of glutamine by resting incubated macrophages was similar to that reported for rat lymphocytes, but was considerably lower than the activity of glutaminase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1182587>Glycerolipid biosynthesis in isolated rat intestinal epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Intestinal epithelial cells were prepared from fasted rats by dispersion with collagenase (EC 3.4.24.3). The structural and metabolic integrity of the cells was verified by electron microscopy, a high percentage of Trypan Blue exclusion, a low degree of release of lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) in the medium, and by the retention of sensitivity to agents known to modify metabolic and transport activity in everted sacs of intestinal mucosa. The isolated intestinal epithelial cells were used to study glycerolipid biosynthesis from glucose, glycerol, 2-monoacylglycerol, and free fatty acids. The cells actively incorporated the labeled precursors into glycerolipids without specific cofactor requirements. Addition of fatty acids stimulated the incorporation of both glucose and glycerol into triacylglycerols and glycerophospholipids, the greatest effect being observed with palmitate. The stimulation of monoacylglycerol acylation appeared to depend on both the nature of the monoacylglycerol and fatty  supplied. Stereospecific analyses of the diacylglycerols formed from 2-monoacylglycerols and free fatty acids showed that 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerols (62-70%) were the major and that 2,3-diacyl-sn-glycerols (30-38%) the minor intermediates in triacylglycerol biosynthesis. The data indicate that isolated intestinal epithelial cells exhibit a total capacity of glycerolipid synthesis and a stereochemical course of reaction which is comparable to that observed for triacylglycerol formation in everted sacs of intestinal mucosa, but much less specific than that seen in microsomal preparations of intestinal mucosa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28119423>Lipid Droplet Biogenesis and Function in the Endothelium.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids (FA) are transported across the capillary endothelium to parenchymal tissues. However, it is not known how endothelial cells (EC) from large vessels process a postprandial surge of FA.This study was designed to characterize lipid droplet (LD) formation in EC by manipulating pathways leading to the formation and degradation of LD. In addition, several functions of LD-derived FA were assessed.LD were present in EC lining the aorta after the peak in plasma triglycerides initiated by a gavage of olive oil in mice, in vivo. Similarly, in isolated aorta,  treatment generates LD in EC ex vivo. Cultured EC readily form LD largely via the enzyme DGAT (diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1) and degrade LD via ATGL (adipocyte triglyceride lipase) after FA loading. Functionally, LD-derived FA are dynamically regulated and function to protect EC from lipotoxic stress and provide FA for metabolic needs.Our results delineate endothelial LD dynamics for the first time in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, LD formation protects EC from lipotoxic stress, regulates EC , and provides a source of FA for adjacent cells in the vessel wall or tissues.© 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15548870>Age-related changes in glucose utilization and fatty  oxidation in a muscle-specific manner during rabbit growth.</a></h2><p>The optimal utilization of energy substrates in muscle fibers is of primary importance for muscle contraction and whole body physiology. This study aimed to investigate the age-related changes in some indicators of glucose catabolism and fatty  oxidation in muscles of growing rabbits. Longissimus lumborum (fast-twitch, LL) and semimembranosus proprius (slow-twitch, SMP) muscles were collected at 10 or 20 weeks of age ( n=6 per age). Glucose transporter GLUT4 content was investigated by immunoblot assay. Activity levels of five enzymes were measured: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and phosphofructokinase (PFK) for ; citrate synthase (CS), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) and -3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (HAD) for oxidation. Mitochondrial and peroxisomal oxidation rates were assessed on fresh homogenates using [1-14C]-oleate as substrate. At both ages, mitochondrial and peroxisomal oxidations rates, as well as activities of oxidative enzymes were higher in SMP than in LL. In both muscles, the apparent rate of fatty  oxidation by the mitochondria did not differ between the two ages. However, a decrease in the activities of the three oxidative enzymes was observed in LL, whereas activities of CS and HAD and peroxisomal oxidation rate of oleate increased between the two ages in SMP muscle. In both muscles, LDH activity increased between 10 and 20 weeks, without variations in glucose uptake (GLUT4 transporter content) and in the first step of glucose utilization (PFK activity). In conclusion, mitochondrial oxidation rate of fatty acids and activities of selected mitochondrial enzymes were largely unrelated. Moreover, regulation of energy metabolism with advancing age differed between muscle types.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22018000>Glucose deprivation in tuberous sclerosis complex-related tumors.</a></h2><p>Cancer cells possess unique metabolic phenotypes that are determined by their underlying oncogenic pathways. Activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling cascade promotes  and leads to glucose-dependence in tumors. In particular, cells with constitutive mTORC1 activity secondary to the loss of TSC1/TSC2 function are prone to undergo apoptosis upon glucose withdrawal in vitro, but this concept has not been tested in vivo. This study examines the effects of restricting glucose metabolism by pharmacologic and dietary means in a tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tumor xenograft model.Tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned to receive unrestricted carbohydrate-free ("Carb-free") or Western-style diet in the absence or presence of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) in one of four treatment groups. After 14 weeks, tumor sizes were significantly different among the four treatment groups with those receiving 2-DG having the smallest tumors. Unexpectedly, the "Carb-free" diet was associated with the largest tumors but they remained responsive to 2-DG. PET imaging showed significant treatment-related changes in tumor 18fluorodeoxyglucose-uptake but the standard uptake values did not correlate with tumor size. Alternative energy substrates such as ketone bodies and monounsaturated  supported the growth of the Tsc2-/- cells in vitro, whereas saturated palmitic  was toxic. Correspondingly, tumors in the high-fat, "Carb-free" group showed greater necrosis and liquefaction that contributed to their larger sizes. In contrast, 2-DG treatment significantly reduced tumor cell proliferation, increased metabolic stress (i.e., ketonemia) and AMPK activity, whereas rapamycin primarily reduced cell size.Our data support the concept of glycolytic inhibition as a therapeutic approach in TSC whereas dietary withdrawal of carbohydrates was not effective.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22156384>Ecotypic variability in the metabolic response of seeds to diurnal hydration-dehydration cycles and its relationship to seed vigor.</a></h2><p>Seeds in the seed bank experience diurnal cycles of imbibition followed by complete dehydration. These conditions pose a challenge to the regulation of germination. The effect of recurring hydration-dehydration (Hy-Dh) cycles were tested on seeds from four Arabidopsis thaliana accessions [Col-0, Cvi, C24 and Ler]. Diurnal Hy-Dh cycles had a detrimental effect on the germination rate and on the final percentage of germination in Col-0, Cvi and C24 ecotypes, but not in the Ler ecotype, which showed improved vigor following the treatments. Membrane permeability measured by ion conductivity was generally increased following each Hy-Dh cycle and was correlated with changes in the redox status represented by the GSSG/GSH (oxidized/reduced glutathione) ratio. Among the ecotypes, Col-0 seeds displayed the highest membrane permeability, whilst Ler was characterized by the greatest increase in electrical conductivity following Hy-Dh cycles. Following Dh 2 and Dh 3, the respiratory activity of Ler seeds significantly increased, in contrast to the other ecotypes, indicative of a dramatic shift in metabolism. These differences were associated with accession-specific content and patterns of change of (i) cell wall-related laminaribiose and mannose; (ii) fatty  composition, specifically of the unsaturated  and α-linoleic ; and (iii) asparagine, ornithine and the related polyamine putrescine. Furthermore, in the Ler ecotype the content of the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle intermediates fumarate, succinate and malate increased in response to dehydration, in contrast to a decrease in the other three ecotypes. These findings provide a link between seed respiration, energy metabolism, fatty  β-oxidation, nitrogen mobilization and membrane permeability and the improved germination of Ler seeds following Hy-Dh cycles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2297101>Fatty  lessens halothane's inhibition of energy metabolism in isolated hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>This study has examined whether adverse halothane effects on liver-cell energy metabolism are influenced by the availability of alternate substrates for energy-generating reactions. Halogenated volatile anesthetics affect both energy supply and energy demand in tissues, and cellular energy deficits have been implicated in anesthetic hepatotoxicity. Using hepatocytes isolated from fed rats either pretreated with phenobarbital or not treated (+PB or -PB cells, respectively), we studied the cellular energetic effects of providing fatty  () along with glucose as substrate(s) for energy metabolism, while exposing the cells to 0%-2% halothane. In -PB cells incubated with glucose alone, there were halothane dose-related decreases in the oxygen (O2) consumption rate (VO2) and in the balance between adenosine triphosphate (ATP) supply and demand (ATP/ADP ratio), but no effect on lactate metabolism (lactate consumption or production) over the 10-min incubation period. Adding oleate along with glucose (a) raised VO2 but lowered ATP/ADP in the absence of halothane; (b) eliminated the decreases in VO2 and ATP/ADP seen when halothane was introduced; and (c) increased lactate consumption in both the presence and absence of halothane. In +PB cells, VO2 was higher, ATP/ADP lower, and lactate consumption also lower than in -PB cells under comparable conditions. Halothane or oleate effects, or both, on energy metabolism were thus qualitatively similar in +PB and -PB cells, except that in +PB cells incubated without oleate, lactate formation developed as halothane was increased from 0% to 2%, reflecting activation of  due to insufficient mitochondrial ATP production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2775207>Rates of utilization of glucose, glutamine and oleate and formation of end-products by mouse peritoneal macrophages in culture.</a></h2><p>1. The metabolism of mouse thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages was studied in culture for up to 96 h. 2. The rates of , lactate formation and glutamine utilization were approximately linear with time for at least 80 h of culture. 3. The rates of glucose and glutamine utilization by cultured macrophages were approx. 500 and 90 nmol/h per mg of protein respectively. This rate of glucose utilization is at least 50% greater than that previously reported for macrophages during 60 min incubation in a shaking flask; and it is now increased by addition of glutamine to the culture medium. The rate of glutamine utilization in culture is similar to that previously reported for macrophages during 60 min incubation. The major end-product of glucose metabolism is lactate, and those of glutamine metabolism are CO2, glutamate, ammonia and alanine. 4. Oleate was utilized by these cells: 14C from [14C]oleate was incorporated into CO2 and cellular lipid. The highest rate of oleate utilization was observed when both glucose and glutamine were present in the culture medium. The presence of oleate in the culture medium did not affect the rates of utilization of either glucose or glutamine. Of the [14C]oleate incorporated into lipid, approx. 80% was incorporated into triacylglycerol and only 18% into phospholipid. 5. The turnover rate for the total ATP content of the macrophage in culture is about 10 times per minute: the value for the perfused isolated maximally working rat heart is 22. This indicates a high metabolic rate for macrophages, and consequently emphasizes the importance of the provision of fuels for their function in an immune response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5776541>Intermediate energy metabolism of Leptospira.</a></h2><p>Metabolic studies were performed on three representative serotypes of Leptospira: a water isolate designated B(16) and two pathogenic serotypes, pomona and schueffneri. Examination of whole cells of B(16) for their ability to oxidize various substrates revealed that oleate significantly stimulated oxygen uptake. The respiratory quotient of 0.7 implied that oleate was degraded to carbon dioxide and water. Other substrates, such as carbohydrates, alcohols, intermediates of the citric  cycle, and short-chain acids, including selected amino acids, did not stimulate endogenous respiration of whole cells. No oxygen uptake could be measured when cell-free extracts were tested with the substrates used with whole cells. Enzymatic analyses of cell-free extracts of the three strains demonstrated enzymes of the citric  cycle, enzymes of the glycolytic and pentose pathways, and the general acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase required for beta-oxidation of fatty acids. Strain B(16) and the two pathogenic serotypes appeared to possess similar metabolic capabilities. Enzymatic data might also explain the apparent inability of B(16) to oxidize other substrates; kinases necessary for activation of common nonphosphorylated compounds were not detected in leptospiral extracts. These findings emphasized the dependence of leptospiral growth upon long-chain fatty acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9239412>Lipoprotein lipase regulates Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis by macrophages maintained in glucose-deficient medium.</a></h2><p>During periods of intense activity such as phagocytosis, macrophages are thought to derive most of their energy from glucose metabolism under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. To determine whether fatty acids released from lipoproteins by macrophage lipoprotein lipase (LPL) could substitute for glucose as a source of energy for phagocytosis, we cultured peritoneal macrophages from normal and LPL knockout (LPL-KO) mice that had been rescued from neonatal demise by expression of human LPL via the muscle creatine kinase promoter. Normal and LPL-KO macrophages were cultured in medium containing normal (5 mM) or low (1 mM) glucose, and were tested for their capacity to phagocytose IgG-opsonized sheep erythrocytes. LPL-KO macrophages maintained in 1 and 5 mM glucose phagocytosed 67 and 79% fewer IgG-opsonized erythrocytes, respectively, than macrophages from normal mice. Addition of VLDL to LPL-expressing macrophages maintained in 1 mM glucose enhanced the macrophages' phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized erythrocytes, but did not stimulate phagocytosis by LPL-KO macrophages. Inhibition of secreted LPL with a monoclonal anti-LPL antibody or with tetrahydrolipstatin blocked the ability of VLDL to enhance phagocytosis by LPL-expressing macrophages maintained in 1 mM glucose. Addition of  significantly enhanced phagocytosis by both LPL-expressing and LPL-KO macrophages maintained in 1 mM glucose. Moreover,  stimulated phagocytosis in cells cultured in non-glucose-containing medium, and increased the intracellular stores of creatine phosphate. Inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, but not of , blocked the capacity of  to stimulate phagocytosis. Receptor-mediated endocytosis of acetyl LDL by macrophages from LPL-expressing and LPL-KO mice was similar whether the cells were maintained in 5 or 1 mM glucose, and was not augmented by VLDL. We postulate that fatty acids derived from macrophage LPL-catalyzed hydrolysis of triglycerides and phospholipids provide energy for macrophages in areas that have limited amounts of ambient glucose, and during periods of intense metabolic activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/332645>Oxidation of substrates by host grown Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepraemurium and by in vitro grown mycobacteria cultured from human armadillo and murine lepromas.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6432984>Fatty- metabolism in oral mucosal epithelium of the hamster.</a></h2><p>Little is known about the role of lipid metabolism in oral mucosal epithelia, although lipids probably play significant roles in the barrier function and in the production of energy for the various epithelial biosynthetic activities. The metabolic fate of exogenously added 14C-labelled  in pure epithelial sheets from hamster cheek-pouch has been investigated. Significant amounts of the label from the fatty  were found in phosphatidyl choline, sphingomyelin and triglyceride fractions. Lesser amounts were found in cholesterol, cholesterol ester, ceramide and phosphatidyl ethanolamine. Estimations of the amount of ATP produced by both  and by fatty- beta-oxidation indicated that the 2 activities were essentially equal, which is in contrast to that reported for the epidermis.

Preparations were viable as shown by stable NTP, metabolite and catecholamine levels and -base status, all of which remained at in vivo levels over the 2 h incubation period. Enzymes diagnostic of , the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle and phosphagen metabolism were all present in significant amounts in red blood cells. In direct comparisons of 14C-labelled substrates at normal resting plasma concentrations, rates of CO2 production were in the order: glucose greater than lactate greater than alanine greater than oleate. Total CO2 production rates from these four oxidative substrates did not equal directly measured O2 consumption rates, indicating that other substrates may also be important in vivo. Oxidative pathway Km values for glucose (8.4 mmol l-1), lactate (3.3 mmol l-1) and alanine (0.8 mmol l-1) were well within the normal physiological ranges of plasma concentrations. Glucose concentration did not affect lactate oxidation rates, but there was some inhibition (27%) of glucose oxidation by high lactate concentrations (20 mmol l-1). The observed Km values and competitive interactions suggest that changes in plasma concentrations associated with environmental stresses can considerably alter the relative rates of oxidation of glucose and lactate in vivo. Considerable pentose-phosphate shunt activity was detected in red cells, as indicated by high activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and high CO2 production rates from (1-14C)-labelled glucose. Even in the presence of normal O2 levels, a significant percentage (28%) of glucose metabolism was directed to lactate production. Taken together, these results demonstrate that rainbow trout whole blood incubated in vitro constitutes a dynamic and viable system for metabolic studies at the pathway level.</p></html>
