<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30781926>Complete Covalent Structure of Human Platelet Factor 4.</a></h2><p>The amino acid sequence of the subunit of human platelet factor 4 has been determined. Human platelet factor 4 consists of identical subunits containing 70 amino acids, each with a molecular  of 7,756. The molecule contains no methionine, phenylalanine or tryptophan. The proposed amino acid sequence of PF4 is: -Ala----Gly--Leu-Gln-Cys-Leu-Cys--Lys-Thr-Thr-Ser- Gln--Arg-Pro-Arg-His--Thr-Ser-Leu----Lys-Ala-Gly-Pro-His-Cys-Pro-Thr-Ala-Gin- Leu--Ala-Thr-Leu-Lys-Asn-Gly-Arg-Lys--Cys-Leu--Leu-Gln-Ala-Pro-Leu-Tyr-Lys-Lys- --Lys-Lys-Leu-Leu--Ser. From consideration of the homology with p-thromboglobulin, disulphide bonds between residues 10 and 36 and between residues 12 and 52 can be inferred.Schattauer GmbH Stuttgart.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27018713>Effects of Alpha-Ketoglutarate on Glutamine Metabolism in Piglet Enterocytes in Vivo and in Vitro.</a></h2><p>Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) plays a vital part in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and is a key intermediate in the oxidation of L-glutamine (Gln). The study was to evaluate effects of AKG on Gln metabolism in vivo and in vitro. A total of twenty-one piglets were weaned at 28 days with a mean body  (BW) of 6.0 ± 0.2 kg, and randomly divided into 3 groups: corn soybean meal based diet (CON group); the basal diet with 1% alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG treatment group); and the basal diet with 1% L-glutamine (GLN treatment group). Intestinal porcine epithelial cells-1 (IPEC-1) were incubated to investigate effects of 0.5, 2, and 3 mM AKG addition on Gln metabolism. Our results showed that there were no differences (P > 0.05) among the 3 treatments in initial BW, final BW, and average daily feed intake. However, average daily gain (P = 0.013) and gain:feed (P = 0.041) of the AKG group were greater than those of the other two groups. In comparison with the CON group, the AKG and GLN groups exhibited an improvement in villus length, mucosal thickness, and crypt depth in the jejunum of piglets. Serum concentrations of , , , , Tyr, Phe, Lys, and Arg in the piglets fed the 1% AKG or Gln diet were lower than those in the CON group. Compared with the CON group, the mRNA expression of jejunal and ileal amino acid (AA) transporters in the AKG and GLN groups were significantly increased (P < 0.05). Additionally, the in vitro study showed that the addition of 0.5, 2, and 3 mM AKG dose-dependently decreased (P < 0.05) the net utilization of Gln and formulation of ammonia, , Ala, and  by IPEC-1. In conclusion, dietary AKG supplementation, as a replacement for Gln, could improve Gln metabolism in piglet enterocytes and enhance the utilization of AA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26506550>Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory peptides in commercial Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses of different ages.</a></h2><p>Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤ 6d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular  (MW) ≤ 3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, -Pro-Pro (IPP), -Pro-Pro (VPP), -Lys---Arg-Phe (EKDERF), -Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro--Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe--Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are more difficult to kill and more expensive to treat. Researchers have been studied on antibiotic alternatives such as antimicrobial peptides and lipopeptides. A functional bacteria MB01 producing lipopeptides which can be used as bacteriostat was isolated from the Bohai Sea sediments, which had been identified as  the morphological, physiological, and biochemical identification and 16s rDNA sequence. The lipopeptides produced by MB01 were determined to be cyclic surfactin homologs by LC-ESI-MS structural identification after crude extraction and LH-20 chromatography. [M+H] 994, 1008, 1022, and 1036 were all the characteristic molecular  of surfactin homologs. CID analysis revealed that the molecular structure of the lipopeptides was R--Leu/-Leu---Leu-Leu/. The lipopeptides showed well resistance to UV light and the change of pH and temperature.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504948>Targeted disruption of TORC1 retards young squab growth by inhibiting the synthesis of crop milk protein in breeding pigeon (Columba livia).</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to explore the regulatory role of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) signaling pathway in crop milk synthesis in breeding pigeons (Columba livia). Three groups of breeding pigeons in the lactation period (n = 30 pairs/group) were respectively injected with rapamycin (RAPA, a specific inhibitor of the target of rapamycin complex) at doses of 0 (vehicle, control), 0.6, or 1.2 mg/kg body  (BW)/day via the wing vein for 7 days. The average daily feed intake (ADFI) and BW of the breeding pigeons and the BW of young squabs were respectively recorded throughout the experimental period. The breeding pigeons were sacrificed to collect their crop tissues, crop milk, and serum on the eighth day of the experiment. The results showed that neither 0.6 nor 1.2 mg/kg BW RAPA injection affected BW loss or ADFI in breeding pigeons (P > 0.05), while crop thickness and crop relative  were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the 1.2 mg/kg BW rapamycin-injected group. Simultaneously, RAPA (especially at 1.2 mg/kg BW) decreased the crude protein, αs1-casein, αs2-casein, β-casein, and amino acid contents (, Thr, Ser, , Gly, Ala, Cys, , Met, , Leu, Tyr, Lys, His, Arg, and Pro) of crop milk (P < 0.05) and the concentrations of albumin, total protein, and uric acid in the serum of breeding pigeons (P < 0.05). Additionally, the expression of TORC1 pathway-related proteins (TORC1, S6K1, S6, 4EBP1, and eIF4E) was downregulated in the crop tissues of breeding pigeons by 0.6 or 1.2 mg/kg BW/day RAPA injection (P < 0.05). Accordingly, the average daily gain (ADG) of young squabs declined, and the mortality rate increased significantly (P < 0.05). Together, the results showed that RAPA reduced protein and amino acid levels in the crop milk of breeding pigeons and retarded young squab growth, suggesting a crucial role of TORC1 in crop milk synthesis in breeding pigeons.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29053831>Effect of dietary fiber levels on performance, gizzard development, intestinal morphology, and nutrient utilization in meat ducks from 1 to 21 days of age.</a></h2><p>The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of dietary fiber levels on growth performance, gizzard development, intestinal morphology, and nutrient utilization in Cherry Valley meat ducks. In total, 720 1-day-old ducklings were fed with starter diets (120 ducklings, 8 pens of 15 ducklings, on each diet) containing 6 levels of crude fiber (CF, 1.46, 3.09, 4.15, 6.18, 7.52, and 9.03%, based on analysis) for 21 d. Then, on d 22, ducks fed all of the starter diets were transferred to a grower diet (containing 4% CF) to examine the residual effect of starter dietary fiber levels until 35 d. Body  (BW), body  gain (BWG), feed intake (FI), feed to gain ratio (F:G) were recorded/calculated weekly. Ducks were sampled for gizzard development and intestinal morphology determination on d 7, 14, and 21. Nutrient utilization was assessed using 25- to 27-day-old ducks. The results showed that BW (d 21), BWG (d 15 to 21, d 1 to 21), and F:G (d 15 to 21, d 1 to 21, and d 1 to 35) were increased quadratically (P < 0.01), and FI (all periods except for d 22 to 35) was increased linearly (P < 0.01), when starter dietary CF levels increased from 1.46 to 9.03%. Ducks under 3.09% and 4.15% CF starter diets had decreased 1 to 35 d FI and F:G when compared to ducks under other starter diets. When compared to ducks fed 1.46% and 3.09% CF starter diets, ducks fed starter diet containing 7.52% CF had increased gizzard development, jejunal morphology, energy retention, excreta nutrients availability, and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of Arg, , Leu, Thr, , , Ala, , Gly, Pro, Ser, and total amino acids. In conclusion, meat ducks from 1 to 21 d of age could adapt to a wide range (3.09% to 7.52%) of dietary fiber levels.© 2017 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30321429>Additivity of apparent and standardized ileal digestibility of amino acids in wheat, canola meal, and sorghum distillers dried grains with solubles in mixed diets fed to broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>An experiment was conducted to investigate which method, apparent ileal digestibility (AID) or standardized ileal digestibility (SID), more accurately predicts the digestibility of crude protein (CP) and amino acids (AA) in mixed diets fed to broiler chickens. Male Ross 308 broiler chickens received a standard starter diet from d 0 to 16 post hatching, thereafter grouped into 8 blocks, based on body  (BW), of 10 birds/cage, and randomly allotted to 6 diets in a randomized complete block design. The 6 diets consisted of a nitrogen-free diet, 3 semi-purified diets, and 2 mixed diets to test the additivity of AID and SID in mixed diets. On d 21 post hatching, digesta from two-thirds of the distal ileum was collected. Using the determined AID or SID for CP and AA in wheat, canola meal (CM), or sorghum distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), the AID or SID for 2 mixed diets based on wheat-CM or wheat-CM-DDGS were predicted and compared with determined AID or SID, respectively. The results revealed that the predicted SID of CP and AA in the wheat-CM mixed diet were consistent with determined values except for  and Ser, and all the predicted SID of CP and AA were consistent with the determined values in the wheat-CM-DDGS mixed diet. The determined AID of , Met, Thr, , Ala, Cys, Ser, and Tyr in the wheat-CM mixed diet were greater (P < 0.05) than predicted AID values. For the wheat-CM-DDGS mixed diet, the determined AID of Trp, Cys, and  were greater (P < 0.05) than the predicted AID values. However, there were more inconsistencies between the determined and predicted values in AID values for wheat-CM than the wheat-CM-DDGS mixed diet than SID values for both diets. In conclusion, the present study confirmed that the SID of CP and AA was more additive than the AID of CP and AA when a mixed diet contained wheat, CM, and DDGS as protein sources in broiler chickens.© 2018 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p></html>
