These free-  receptors include FFA2 and FFA3, which are agonized by short-chained FFA, as well as FFA1 and FFA4, which are agonized by medium-to-long chained FFA. Ligands for FFA1 and FFA4 comprise the family of long chain polyunsaturated omega-3   including α- (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), suggesting that many of the long-known beneficial effects of these fats may be receptor mediated. In this regard, FFA4 has gathered considerable interest due to its role in ameliorating inflammation, promoting insulin sensitization, and regulating energy metabolism in response to FFA ligands. The goal of this review is to summarize the body of evidence in regard to FFA4 signal transduction, its mechanisms of regulation, and its functional role in a variety of tissues. In addition, recent endeavors toward discovery of small molecules that modulate FFA4 activity are also presented.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The   composition of the lipid membrane of L. acidophilus La-5 was significantly different upon growth in MRS (containing Tween 80, an oleic  source), or in MRS with Tween 20 (containing C12:0 and C14:0), linoleic, or  supplemented. Bacteria grown in MRS showed the highest storage survival rates. No indications of loss of membrane integrity could be found, and membrane integrity could therefore not be connected with loss of viability. Survival of bacteria grown with linoleic or  was more negatively affected by the presence of oxygen, than bacteria grown in MRS or with Tween 20 supplemented. A small, but significant, loss of  during storage could be identified, and an increase of  secondary oxidation products during storage was found for bacteria grown in MRS, or with linoleic, or  supplemented, but not for bacteria grown with Tween 20. Overall, the results indicate that lipid oxidation and loss of membrane integrity are not the only or most important detrimental reactions which can occur during storage. By altering the   composition, it was also found that properties of oleic  gave rise to more robust bacteria than more saturated or unsaturated   did.© 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28624284>Comparing the effect of homogenization and heat processing on the properties and in vitro digestion of milk from organic and conventional dairy herds.</a></h1><p>We compared the effects of homogenization and heat processing on the chemical and in vitro digestion traits of milk from organic and conventional herds. Raw milk from organic (>50% of dry matter intake from pasture) and conventional (no access to pasture) farms were adjusted to commercial whole and nonfat milk fat standards, and processed with or without homogenization, and with high-temperature-short-time or UHT pasteurization. The milk then underwent in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Comparison of milk from organic and conventional herds showed that the milks responded to processing in similar ways. General composition was the same among the whole milk samples and among the nonfat milk samples. Protein profiles were similar, with intact caseins and whey proteins predominant and only minor amounts of peptides. Whole milk samples from grazing cows contained higher levels of α- (C18:3), vaccenic (C18:1 trans), and conjugated linoleic , and lower levels of palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0)  than samples from nongrazing cows. Processing had no effect on conjugated linoleic  and  levels in milk, although homogenization resulted in higher levels of C8 to C14 saturated  . Of the 9  compounds evaluated, milk from grazing cows contained lower levels of 2-butanone than milk from nongrazing cows, and milk from both farms showed spikes for heptanal in UHT samples and spikes for butanoic, octanoic, nonanoic, and N-decanoic  in homogenized samples. At the start of in vitro digestion, nonfat raw and pasteurized milk samples formed the largest  clots, and organic milk clots were larger than conventional milk clots; UHT whole milk formed the smallest clots. Milk digests from grazing cows had lower levels of free   than digests from nongrazing cows. In vitro proteolysis was similar in milk from both farms and resulted in 85 to 95% digestibility. Overall, milk from organic/grass-fed and conventional herds responded in similar ways to typical homogenization and heat processing used in United States dairy plants and showed only minor differences in chemical traits and in vitro digestion. Findings from this research enhance our knowledge of the effect of processing on the quality traits and digestibility of milk from organic/pasture-fed and confined conventional herds and will help health-conscious consumers make informed decisions about dairy selections.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

Helan, the semi-arid area. The vines received water with 60% (RDI-1), 70% (RDI-2), 80% (RDI-3), 100% (CK, traditional drip irrigation) of their estimated evapotranspiration (ETc) respectively. RDI treatments resulted in lower yield, berry weight and titratable acidity with higher total soluble solids. RDI-1 increased the content of unsaturated   in berries and decreased the level of alcohols and esters volatiles in wines. RDI-2 and RDI-3 enhanced 1-hexanol and esters in wines in comparison with CK. The concentrations of C aroma compounds were closely correlated with unsaturated   (p < .05), especially  and linoleic . The present results provided direct evidence and detailed data to explain the effect of RDI on grapes and wines composition regarding   and their derived volatiles.Copyright © 2017.

Occurrence of epoxidation reactions.</a></h1><p>Fresh and partially oxidized flaxseed oil, as models of omega-3 rich lipids, were submitted to in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Hydrolysis level, lipid composition and oxidative status of the samples before and after digestion were studied by Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (H NMR) and Solid Phase Microextraction-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS). Although a great degree of lipolysis was reached in both kinds of samples after digestion, it was somewhat lower in the digests of oxidized flaxseed oil. The occurrence of lipid oxidation during digestion was evidenced by decreased unsaturated lipids and increased primary and secondary oxidation products, especially in oxidized samples. In these latter, -derived monoepoxy-octadecadienoates were the main oxidation products generated. SPME-GC/MS study showed the highest abundances of highly reactive alkadienals (C5-C10), alkatrienals (C9-C10) and -derived 4,5-epoxy-2-heptenals in the headspace of oxidized flaxseed oil digests.  markers of Maillard-type reactions were also detected.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This process generates lipid fragmentation products including malondialdehyde (MDA), an archetypal marker of PUFA oxidation. We observed transient increases in levels of endogenous MDA in wounded Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, raising the possibility that MDA is metabolized. We developed a rigorous ion exchange method to purify enzymatically generated (13)C- and (14)C-MDA. Delivered as a  to intact plants, MDA was efficiently incorporated into lipids. Mass spectral and genetic analyses identified the major chloroplast galactolipid: α- (18:3)-7Z,10Z,13Z-hexadecatrienoic  (16:3)-monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (18:3-16:3-MGDG) as an end-product of MDA incorporation. Consistent with this, the fad3-2 fad7-2 fad8 mutant that lacks tri-unsaturated   incorporated (14)C-MDA into 18:2-16:2-MGDG. Saponification of (14)C-labeled 18:3-16:3-MGDG revealed 84% of (14)C-label in the acyl groups with the remaining 16% in the head group. 18:3-16:3-MGDG is enriched proximal to photosystem II and is likely a major in vivo source of MDA in photosynthetic tissues. We propose that nonenzymatically generated lipid fragments such as MDA are recycled back into plastidic galactolipids that, in their role as cell protectants, can again be fragmented into MDA.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27300155>Linseed oil gelled emulsion: A successful fat replacer in dry fermented sausages.</a></h1><p>Different levels of animal fat replacement by a high omega-3 content carrageenan gelled emulsion in dry fermented sausages were studied in order to improve their   composition. Percentages of fat replacement were 26.3% (SUB1), 32.8% (SUB2) and 39.5% (SUB3). α- (ALA) content increased up to 1.81, 2.19 and 2.39g/100g (SUB1, SUB2, and SUB3 products) as compared to the Control (0.35g/100g), implying an increment in polyunsaturated   (PUFA) supply (up to 10.3%) and reductions in omega-6/ omega-3 ratio (75, 82 and 84%, respectively). Peroxides and TBARs values were not affected (P>0.05) by the fat modification and a slight low formation of  aldehydes derived from lipid oxidation was detected. Fat replacement did not cause relevant modifications on the instrumental color properties and no sensory differences (P>0.05) were found between Control and SUB2 products (32.8%) for taste and juiciness, pointing out the viability of this formulation for human consumption.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Lipid-derived signaling molecules, oxylipins, produced by a multi-branch pathway are central in regulation of a wide range of functions. The two most known branches, allene oxide synthase (AOS) and 13-hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) pathways, are best recognized as producers of defense compounds against biotic challenges. In the present work, we examine the role of these two oxylipin branches in plant tolerance to the abiotic stress, namely excessive light. Towards this goal, we have analyzed variable chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of intact leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes with altered oxylipin profile, followed by examining the impact of exogenous application of selected oxylipins on functional activity of photosynthetic apparatus in intact leaves and isolated thylakoid membranes. Our findings unequivocally bridge the function of oxylipins to photosynthetic processes. Specifically, HPL overexpressing lines display enhanced adaptability in response to high light treatment as evidenced by lower rate constant of photosystem 2 (PS2) photoinhibition and higher rate constant of PS2 recovery after photoinhibition. In addition, exogenous application of , 13-hydroperoxy , 12-oxophytodienoic , and methyl jasmonate individually, suppresses photochemical activity of PS2 in intact plants and isolated thylakoid membranes, while application of HPL-branch metabolites-does not. Collectively these data implicate function of HPL branch of oxylipin biosynthesis pathway in guarding PS2 under high light conditions, potentially exerted through tight regulation of free  and 13-hydroperoxy  levels, as well as competition with production of metabolites by AOS-branch of the oxylipin pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28914016>[Analysis and evaluation of resourceful chemical compositions in different parts of Zanthoxylum bungeanum fruit and its seed oil].</a></h1><p>The study aims of this study is to analyze and evaluate the resourceful chemical compositions in different parts of mature fruit of Zanthoxylum bungeanum, and provide a scientific basis for the comprehensive utilization of this medicinal plant resources.

Our previous study demonstrated that jasmine lactone was mostly accumulated at the turnover stage of the oolong tea manufacturing process. This study investigates the previously unknown mechanism of formation of jasmine lactone in tea leaves exposed to multiple stresses occurring during the growth and manufacturing processes. Both continuous mechanical damage and the dual stress of low temperature and mechanical damage enhanced jasmine lactone accumulation in tea leaves. In addition, only one pathway, via hydroperoxy   from unsaturated  , including linoleic  and α-, under the action of lipoxygenases (LOXs), especially CsLOX1, was significantly affected by these stresses.

Arnica plant is considered a potential candidate material with high antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Therefore, in this study, a locally available Heterotheca inuloides, also known as Mexican arnica, was analyzed for the extraction of high-value compounds. Based on different pressure (P), temperature (T), and co-solvent (CoS), four treatments (T) were prepared. A maximum 7.13% yield was recovered from T2 (T = 60 °C, P = 10 MPa, CoS = 8 g/min), followed by 6.69% from T4 (T = 60 °C, P = 30 MPa, CoS = 4 g/min). Some bioactive sesquiterpenoids such as 7-hydroxycadalene, caryophyllene and δ-cadinene were identified in the extracts by GC/MS.

In this study, 67 kinds of soybean cultivars were selected, and correlation analysis was conducted between physicochemical indexes of these soybean cultivars and flavor characteristic indexes of soymilk. With clustering analysis, all the soybean cultivars could be classified into three classes, and according to the results of principal component analysis for each class of soymilk flavor characteristics, the soymilk of second class had relatively heavier beany and non-beany flavor, and the third class had weaker flavor. For soybean cultivars of which the soymilk characteristics were unknown, two discriminant functions could be used to predict flavor characteristics if the physicochemical indexes were known. Therefore, screening of soybean cultivars suitable for soymilk processing can be targeted for the flavor favored by consumers and an evaluation method established.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The results showed that, besides concentration, UFAs types could also influence fermentation process and volatiles in final wine. Low concentrations of UFAs (12 and 60 mg/L), especially LA and OA, significantly promoted fermentation activity and most volatiles when compared to the control, however, the effect became the inhibition with increasing concentrations of UFAs (120 and 240 mg/L). It was interesting to find that OA addition (12 and 60 mg/L) could generate more acetate esters (especially isoamyl acetate) in wine, while 12 mg/L LA facilitated more   formation (octanoic  and decanoic ). In comparison, 120 and 240 mg/L ALA produced more amount of C6 alcohols (1-hexanol) and higher alcohols (isobutyl alcohol and 2,3-butanediol). UFAs additions were unfavorable for ethyl esters formation, except for an increment of ethyl hexanoate in 12 mg/L OA wine. As a result, different aromatic profiles of wines were generated by variations of UFAs types and levels, as shown by PCA. The transcriptional data revealed that the expressions of aroma-related genes, such as , , , , , , , ,  and  were correlated with aroma compounds productions in different treatments. Our data suggested that the three UFAs have different enological functions and they could generate different aromatic profiles. Thus, besides concentrations, it is essential to consider the types of UFAs when applying the strategy to adjust UFAs contents to modulate the aromatic quality of wines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29146946>De novo Transcriptome Sequencing of MeJA-Induced Taraxacum koksaghyz Rodin to Identify Genes Related to Rubber Formation.</a></h1><p>Increase in the consumption of natural rubber (NR) has necessitated the identification of alternative sources of NR. The quality of NR produced by Taraxacum koksaghyz Rodin (TKS) is comparable to that from Hevea brasiliensis (H.brasiliensis), and therefore, TKS is being considered as an alternative source of NR. Here, we sequenced the TKS root transcriptome after wild TKS seedlings were treated with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) for 0, 6, and 24 h. The clean reads generated for each experimental line were assembled into 127,833 unigenes. The Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway prediction suggested that methyl jasmonate regulated secondary metabolism in TKS. Differential expression analysis showed that the expression of HMGCR, FPPS, IDI, GGPPS, and REF/SRPP increased with methyl jasmonate treatment. Interestingly, differential expression analysis of the jasmonate (JA)-related transcription factors (TFs), indicated that certain genes encoding these transcription factors (namely, bHLH, MYB, AP2/EREBP, and WRKY) showed the same expression pattern in the lines treated for 6 h and 24 h. Moreover, HMGCR was up-regulated in the transgenic seedlings overexpressing DREB. We predicted that methyl jasmonate regulated secondary metabolism and affected rubber biosynthesis via the interaction of the JA-related TFs with genes associated with rubber biosynthesis in TKS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31178837>Transcriptional Comparison Investigating the Influence of the Addition of Unsaturated   on Aroma Compounds During Alcoholic Fermentation.</a></h1><p>The levels of unsaturated   (UFAs) in grape must significantly influence yeast metabolism and the production of aroma compounds. In this work, cDNA microarray technology was applied to analyze the transcriptional discrepancies of wine yeast (commercial wine yeast Lalvin EC1118) fermenting in synthetic grape must supplemented with different concentrations of a mixture of UFAs (including linoleic , oleic , and α-). The results showed that the initial addition of a high level of UFAs can significantly enrich the intracellular UFAs when compared to a low addition of UFAs and further increase the cell population and most volatiles, including higher alcohols and esters, except for several  . Microarray analyses identified that 63 genes were upregulated, and 91 genes were downregulated during the different fermentation stages. The up-regulated genes were involved in yeast growth and proliferation, stress responses and amino  transportation, while the repressed genes were associated with lipid and sterol biosynthesis, amino  metabolism, TCA cycle regulation, mitochondrial respiration, and stress responses. Unexpectedly, the genes directly related to the biosynthesis of  compounds did not vary substantially between the fermentations with the high and low UFA additions. The beneficial aromatic function of the UFAs was ascribed to the increased biomass and amino  transportation, considering that the incorporation of the additional UFAs in yeast cells maintains high membrane fluidity and increases the ability of the cells to resist deleterious conditions. Our results highlighted the importance of UFAs in the regulation of aroma biosynthesis during wine fermentation and suggested that the improvement of the resistance of yeast to extreme stresses during alcoholic fermentation is essential to effectively modulate and improve the production of aroma compounds. A potential way to achieve this goal could be the rational increase of the UFA contents in grape must.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26454474>Spruce Budworm (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) Oral Secretions II: Chemistry.</a></h1><p>As sessile organisms, plants have evolved different methods to defend against attacks and have adapted their defense measures to discriminate between mechanical damage and herbivory by insects. One of the ways that plant defenses are triggered is via elicitors from insect oral secretions (OS). In this study, we investigated the ability of second-instar (L2) spruce budworm [SBW; Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens)] to alter the  organic compounds (VOCs) of four conifer species [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., Picea mariana (Miller) B.S.P., Picea glauca (Moench) Voss, Picea rubens (Sargent)] and found that the emission profiles from all host trees were drastically changed after herbivory. We then investigated whether some of the main elicitors (  conjugates [FACs], β-glucosidase, and glucose oxidase) studied were present in SBW OS. FACs (glutamine and glutamic ) based on , linoleic, oleic, and stearic  were all observed in varying relative quantities. Hydroxylated FACs, such as volicitin, were not observed. Enzyme activity for β-glucosidase was also measured and found present in SBW OS, whereas glucose oxidase activity was not found in the SBW labial glands. These results demonstrate that SBW L2 larvae have the ability to induce VOC emissions upon herbivory and that SBW OS contain potential elicitors to induce these defensive responses. These data will be useful to further evaluate whether these elicitors can separately induce the production of specific VOCs and to investigate whether and how these emissions benefit the plant.© Crown copyright 2015.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30556509>Properties of Oils From Plantain Pseudostem Biotransformed Using Crude Local Enzyme Sources: A Comparison of Poultry Feed Oil.</a></h1><p>Plantain Pseudostem (PPS) wastes were biotransformed by applying Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) using excised snail digestive juice and yeast slurry, and their oil properties compared with oils from commercially sold poultry feeds (PF).

Interestingly, the content of pyrazines-compounds responsible for pungent and unpleasant Cheonggukjang flavors-was significantly higher in Neulchan compared to that in Saedanbaek. Although the fermentation period was not a strong factor affecting the observed changes in   profiles, we noted that profiles of volatiles in Cheonggukjang changed significantly over time, and different cultivars represented specific  profiles. Thus, further sensory evaluation might be needed to determine if such differences influence consumers' preferences.

From detection of elicitors to VOC emissions, plants utilize sophisticated systems that resemble the plant-microbe interaction system.  -amino  conjugates (FACs), a class of insect elicitors, resemble compounds synthesized by microbes in nature. Recent evidence suggests that the recognition of insect elicitors by an ancestral microbe-associated defense system may be the origin of tritrophic interactions mediated by FACs.

A transcription assay using LβT2 cells demonstrated that LCFAs, oleic , α-, docosahexaenoic  and palmitate, repressed the expression of Cga, Lhb, and Fshb at concentrations between 50 and 100 µM. On the other hand, treatment with 10 µM unsaturated LCFAs, oleic , α- and docosahexaenoic , repressed only Fshb expression, while the same dose of a saturated LCFA, palmitate, had no effect on the expression of gonadotropin subunit genes. Furthermore, GW9508 did not affect promoter activity. Next, we examined deletion mutants of the upstream region of Fshb and found that the upstream regulatory region (-2824 to -2343 bp) of Fshb was responsible for the notable repression by 10 µM unsaturated LCFAs. Our results suggest that the upstream region of Fshb is susceptible to unsaturated LCFAs. In addition, unsaturated LCFAs play a role in repressing Fshb expression through the distal -2824 to -2343 bp region, which might be independent of the LCFA receptor GPR120 pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25474290>Evolution of the aroma volatiles of pear fruits supplemented with   metabolic precursors.</a></h1><p>To examine the biochemical metabolism of aroma volatiles derived from  , pear fruits were incubated in vitro with metabolic precursors of these compounds. Aroma volatiles, especially esters, were significantly increased, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in pear fruits fed on   metabolic precursors. Cultivars having different flavor characteristics had distinctly different aroma  metabolisms. More esters were formed in fruity-flavored "Nanguoli" fruits than in green-flavored "Dangshansuli" fruits fed on the same quantities of linoleic  and . Hexanal and hexanol were more efficient metabolic intermediates for  synthesis than linoleic  and . Hexyl esters were the predominant esters produced by pear fruits fed on hexanol, and their contents in "Dangshansuli" fruits were higher than in "Nanguoli" fruits. Hexyl esters and hexanoate esters were the primary esters produced in pear fruits fed on hexanal, however the content of hexyl ester in "Dangshansuli" was approximately three times that in "Nanguoli". The higher contents of hexyl esters in "Dangshansuli" may have resulted from a higher level of hexanol derived from hexanal. In conclusion, the synthesis of aroma volatiles was largely dependent on the metabolic precursors presented.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27043529>Two ω-3 FADs Are Associated with Peach Fruit  Formation.</a></h1><p>Aroma-related volatiles, together with sugars and , play an important role in determining fruit flavor quality. Characteristic volatiles of peach fruit are mainly derived from   such as linoleic  (18:2) and  (18:3). In the present study, six genes encoding   desaturases (FAD) were cloned, including two ω-6 FAD genes (PpFAD2, PpFAD6) and four ω-3 FAD genes (PpFAD3-1, PpFAD3-2, PpFAD7 and PpFAD8). Heterologous expression of peach FADs in tobacco plants showed that PpFAD3-1, and PpFAD3-2 significantly reduced contents of 18:2, and accumulated significant higher levels of 18:3. In the case of volatiles, transgenic plants produced lower concentrations of hexanal and higher levels of (E)-2-hexenal. Consequently, the ratio of the (E)-2-hexenal and hexanal was about 5- and 3-fold higher than that of wild type (WT) in PpFAD3-1 and PpFAD3-2 transformants, respectively. No significant changes in  profiles were observed in transgenic plants overexpressing the four other peach FAD genes. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis showed that ripe fruit had high PpFAD3-1 and low PpFAD3-2 transcript levels. In contrast, high PpFAD3-2 and low PpFAD3-1 transcript levels were observed in young fruit. These results indicate a temporal regulation of these two ω-3 FADs during development and ripening, influencing peach fruit  formation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28246442>Effects of different vegetable oils on rumen fermentation and conjugated linoleic  concentration .</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of different vegetable oils on rumen fermentation and concentrations of beneficial -9 -11 C18:2 conjugated linoleic  (CLA) and -11 C18:1   (FA) in the rumen fluid in an  condition.Six vegetable oils including sunflower, soybean, sesame, rice bran, groundnut, and mustard oils were used at three dose levels (0%, 3% and 4% of substrate dry matter [DM] basis) in three replicates for each treatment in a completely randomized design using 6 × 3 factorial arrangement. Rumen fluid for microbial culture was collected from four goats fed on a diet of concentrate mixture and berseem hay at a ratio of 60:40 on DM basis. The  fermentation was performed in 100 ml conical flakes containing 50 ml of culture media and 0.5 g of substrates containing 0%, 3% and 4% vegetable oils.Oils supplementation did not affect (p>0.05)  DM digestibility, and concentrations of total  FAs and ammonia-N. Sunflower oil and soybean oil decreased (p<0.05) protozoal numbers with increasing levels of oils. Other oils had less pronounced effect (p>0.05) on protozoal numbers. Both -11 C18:1 FA and -9, -11 CLA concentrations were increased (p<0.05) by sunflower and soybean oil supplementation at 4% level with the highest concentration observed for sunflower oil. The addition of other oils did not significantly (p>0.05) increase the -11 C18:1 FA and -9, -11 CLA concentrations as compared to the control. The concentrations of stearic, oleic, linoleic, and   were not altered (p>0.05) due to the addition of any vegetable oils.Supplementation of sunflower and soybean oils enhanced beneficial -11 C18:1 FA and -9, -11 CLA concentrations in rumen fluid, while sesame, rice bran, groundnut, and mustard oils were ineffective in this study.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25997623>Effects of dietary n-6/n-3   ratio on nutrient digestibility and blood metabolites of Hanwoo heifers.</a></h1><p>The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of dietary n-6/n-3   (FA) ratio on digestibility, blood metabolites and FA profile of Hanwoo heifers. Fifteen Hanwoo heifers (22 ± 3 months old; 357 ± 69.7 kg) were randomly assigned to three dietary treatments with n-6/n-3 FA ratios of 2.07, 5.18 and 7.37. The animals were housed individually in digestion crates and fed total mixed rations at 2.2% of body weight for 2 weeks of adaptation and 1 week of collection. Treatment effects on in vivo digestibility, plasma metabolite and   profiles, and in vitro ruminal fermentation and   profiles were examined. In vivo digestibility was not affected (P > 0.05) by dietary n-6/n-3 FA ratio. However, in vitro dry matter digestibility and concentrations of total  and propionate decreased (P < 0.05) linearly with increasing n-6/n-3 FA ratio. Plasma insulin and progesterone increased linearly (P < 0.05), but  and total n-3 FA decreased linearly (P < 0.05) with increasing n-6/n-3 ratio. Increasing the dietary n-6/n-3 FA ratio can increase the n-6/n-3 FA ratio in plasma and ruminal fluid as well as plasma progesterone secretion.© 2015 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30201972>Co-overexpression of native phospholipid-biosynthetic genes plsX and plsC enhances lipid production in Synechocystis sp.

The plsC/plsX-overexpressing (OX + XC) strain produced high lipid content of about 24.3%w/dcw under normal condition and was further enhanced up to 39.1%w/dcw by acetate induction. This OX + XC engineered strain was capable of decreasing phaA transcript level which related to poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis under acetate treatment. Moreover, the expression level of gene transcripts revealed that the plsX- and plsC/plsX-overexpression strains had also increased accA transcript amounts which involved in the irreversible carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. Altogether, these overexpressing strains significantly augmented higher lipid contents when compared to wild type by partly overcoming the limitation of lipid production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26990186>Sensory and Physicochemical Studies of Thermally Micronized Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and Green Lentil (Lens culinaris) Flours as Binders in Low-Fat Beef Burgers.</a></h1><p>Pulses are known to be nutritious foods but are susceptible to oxidation due to the reaction of lipoxygenase (LOX) with  and linoleic  which can lead to off flavors caused by the formation of  organic compounds (VOCs). Infrared micronization at 130 and 150 °C was investigated as a heat treatment to determine its effect on LOX activity and VOCs of chickpea and green lentil flour. The pulse flours were added to low-fat beef burgers at 6% and measured for consumer acceptability and physicochemical properties. Micronization at 130 °C significantly decreased LOX activity for both flours. The lentil flour micronized at 150 °C showed a further significant decrease in LOX activity similar to that of the chickpea flour at 150 °C. The lowering of VOCs was accomplished more successfully with micronization at 130 °C for chickpea flour while micronization at 150 °C for the green lentil flour was more effective. Micronization minimally affected the characteristic   content in each flour but significantly increased omega-3 and n-6   at 150 °C in burgers with lentil and chickpea flours, respectively. Burgers with green lentil flour micronized at 130 and 150 °C, and chickpea flour micronized at 150 °C were positively associated with acceptability. Micronization did not affect the shear force and cooking losses of the burgers made with both flours. Formulation of low-fat beef burgers containing 6% micronized gluten-free binder made from lentil and chickpea flour is possible based on favorable results for physicochemical properties and consumer acceptability.© 2016 Institute of Food Technologists®</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30591336>Production, milk   profile, and nutrient utilization in grazing dairy cows supplemented with ground flaxseed.</a></h1><p>Flaxseed has been extensively used as a supplement for dairy cows because of its high concentrations of energy and the n-3   (FA) cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3. However, limited information is available regarding the effect of ground flaxseed on dry matter intake (DMI), ruminal fermentation, and nutrient utilization in grazing dairy cows. Twenty multiparous Jersey cows averaging (mean ± standard deviation) 111 ± 49 d in milk in the beginning of the study were used in a randomized complete block design to investigate the effects of supplementing herbage (i.e., grazed forage) with ground corn-soybean meal mix (control diet = CTRL) or ground flaxseed (flaxseed diet = FLX) on animal production, milk FA, ruminal metabolism, and nutrient digestibility. The study was conducted from June to September 2013, with data and sample collection taking place on wk 4, 8, 12, and 16. Cows were fed a diet formulated to yield a 60:40 forage-to-concentrate ratio consisting of (dry matter basis): 40% cool-season perennial herbage, 50% partial total mixed ration, and 10% of ground corn-soybean meal mix or 10% ground flaxseed. However, estimated herbage DMI averaged 5.59 kg/d or 34% of the total DMI. Significant treatment by week interactions were observed for milk and blood urea N, and several milk FA (e.g., trans-10 18:1). No significant differences between treatments were observed for herbage and total DMI, milk yield, feed efficiency, concentrations and yields of milk components, and urinary excretion of purine derivatives. Total-tract digestibility of organic matter decreased, whereas that of neutral detergent fiber increased with feeding FLX versus CTRL. No treatment effects were observed for ruminal concentrations of total  FA and NH-N, and ruminal proportions of acetate and propionate. Ruminal butyrate tended to decrease, and the acetate-to-propionate ratio decreased in the FLX diet. Most saturated and unsaturated FA in milk fat were changed. Specifically, milk proportion of cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3, Σn-3 FA, and Σ18C FA increased, whereas that of cis-9,cis-12 18:2, Σn-6 FA, Σ odd-chain FA, Σ<16C FA, and Σ16C FA decreased with feeding FLX versus the CTRL diet. In conclusion, feeding FLX did not change yields of milk and milk components, but increased milk n-3 FA. Therefore, costs and industry adoption of premiums for n-3-enriched milk will determine the adoption of ground flaxseed in pasture-based dairy farms.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

There is an increasing interest in the fortification of surimi with ω-3 polyunsaturated   because of their health benefits. However, lipid oxidation should be considered as an important factor during storage. Hence, in this study, the quality properties and oxidative stability of surimi fortified with 30 g kg perilla oil (PO), or 5 g kg 6-gingerol (GI) or their combination (PO+GI) was investigated.Perilla oil significantly improved whiteness of surimi gel, but negatively influenced its gel strength, water holding capacity (WHC) and texture. However, there was no significant difference in texture properties among GI, PO+GI and control groups. During the whole storage period, GI and PO+GI groups had higher gel strength and WHC than control and PO groups. Moreover, lower thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS), total  basic nitrogen (TVB-N), carbonyl content and total plate count (TPC) were observed in GI group compared with other groups.Perilla oil and 6-gingerol could be applied together to effectively fortify surimi qualities.

Ten rumen and duodenal fistulated Nellore steers (268 body weight±27 kg) were distributed in a duplicated 5×5 Latin square. Dietary treatments were as follows: without fat (WF), palm oil (PO), linseed oil (LO), protected fat (PF; Lactoplus), and whole soybeans (WS). The roughage feed was corn silage (600 g/kg on a dry matter [DM] basis) plus concentrate (400 g/kg on a DM basis). The higher intake of DM and organic matter (OM) (p<0.001) was found in animals on the diet with PF and WF (around 4.38 and 4.20 kg/d, respectively). Treatments with PO and LO decreased by around 10% the total digestibility of DM and OM (p<0.05).

GLA contents around 25% with respect to total   content were measured in seeds after pre-harvest treatment of black currants with 0.02mM MJ in 0.05% Tween-20. High GLA samples also exhibited high SA content (higher than 10% with respect to total   content); however, ALA dropped (from 16% to 10%). High GLA content seeds also showed increased contents of gallic, caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic .

This study was to examine the effect of fish oil and/or malate on the production of conjugated   and methane (CH4 ) by rumen microbes when incubated with linseed oil. Linseed oil (LO), LO with fish oil (LO-FO), LO with malate (LO-MA), or LO with fish oil and malate (LO-FO-MA) was added to diluted rumen fluid, respectively. The LO-MA and LO-FO-MA increased pH and propionate concentration compared to the other treatments. LO-MA and LO-FO-MA reduced CH4 production compared to LO. LO-MA and LO-FO-MA increased the contents of c9,t11-conjugated linoleic  (CLA) and c9,t11,c15-conjugated  (CLnA) compared to LO. The content of malate was rapidly reduced while that of lactate was reduced in LO-MA and LO-FO-MA from 3 h incubation time. The fold change of the quantity of methanogen related to total bacteria was decreased at both 3 h and 6 h incubation times in all treatments compared to the control.

Among the volatiles formed during heating of stigmasteryl esters aldehydes, ketones, alcohols and hydrocarbons were found. The mechanism of the formation of  compounds from sterol esters was related to oxidation of steryl and   moieties. In particular, 2-methyl-3-pentanone and 5-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hepten-2-one were identified as unique degradation products formed from degradation of the steryl moiety specifically, and a mechanism of their formation was suggested. Both volatiles could be a good indicator of thermo-oxidative degradation of functional food products enriched in phytosterols and their esters.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Aldehydes are therefore potential non-invasive biomarkers of oxidative stress and of various diseases in which oxidative stress is thought to play a role including cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

Thirty-five Limousin heifers, initially weighing 383 ± 45 kg, were fed fresh grass at 400 or 2000 m above sea level, or a 1:1 mixture of alpine grass and lowland grass hay at 2000 m. After 9 weeks, the six heaviest and oldest animals per group were slaughtered. The remaining animals were finished for 8 weeks on a silage-concentrate diet in the lowlands to similar age and body weight as the first slaughtered group. Carcass and meat quality (M. longissimus thoracis) were assessed in various respects. The average daily gains achieved were of about 600 g/d and similar between forage-type groups. Dressing percentage was 53.5% in the alpine and 57.2% in the lowland group. Carcass conformation and fat cover scores did not differ between forage-type groups. The meat from the alpine groups had greater ultimate pH and smaller redness, yellowness and protein contents. Still, these differences were of minor practical relevance. There was no forage-type effect on water-holding capacity and shear force of the meat. The alpine systems enhanced the proportion of α- in intramuscular fat and decreased the levels of some  compounds in perirenal fat. Finishing resulted in compensatory growth, especially in the animals previously fed lowland grass. There was a trend for the finished compared with the non-finished groups towards greater carcass fat cover and intramuscular fat content. Additionally, ultimate pH was smaller and cooking loss was greater with than without finishing. Meat colour differences were also observed. Shear force was not affected by finishing. The finished animals had a smaller α- proportion in the intramuscular fat. In conclusion, the forage type had small effects on carcass and meat quality. Finishing did not substantially improve carcass and meat quality.

CYP74B24 gene was expressed throughout the aerial organs in a rather constitutive manner and further induced by mechanical wounding. Constitutive expression of CYP74B24 gene in intact tea leaves might account for low but substantial and constitutive formation of a subset of GLVs, some of which are stored as glycosides. Our results not only provide novel insights into the biological roles that GLVs play in tea plants, but also serve as basis for the improvement of aroma quality in tea manufacturing processes.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Carotino oil was added to a basal diet (50% concentrate and 50% oil palm frond) at the rate of 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8% dry matter of the diet. Rumen inoculum was obtained from three fistulated Boer bucks and incubated with 200 mg of each treatment for 24 h at 39°C. Gas production, fermentation kinetics, in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD),  (VFA), in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), metabolizable energy and free   were determined. Carotino oil did not affect (P > 0.05) gas production, metabolizable energy, pH, IVOMD, IVDMD, methane, total and individual VFAs. However, Carotino oil decreased (P < 0.05) the biohydrogenation of linoleic and   but enhanced (P < 0.05) the biohydrogenation of oleic . After 24 h incubation, the concentrations of stearic, palmitic, pentadecanoic, myristic, myristoleic and lauric  decreased (P < 0.05) while the concentration of , linoleic, oleic and transvaccenic  and conjugated linoleic  (CLAc9t11) increased (P < 0.05) with increasing levels of Carotino oil. Carotino oil seems to enhance the accumulation of beneficial unsaturated   without disrupting rumen fermentation.© 2014 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30140814>Anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of Rosa Mosqueta oil supplementation in rat liver ischemia-reperfusion.</a></h1><p>Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) is a deleterious condition associated with liver transplantation or resection that involves pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory mechanisms. Considering that Rosa Mosqueta (RM) oil composition is rich in protective components such as α- (ALA) and tocopherols, we studied the effects of RM oil supplementation given prior to an IR protocol. Male Sprague-Dawley rats receiving RM oil (0.4 mL d-1) for 21 days were subjected to 1 h of ischemia followed by 20 h reperfusion. Parameters of liver injury (serum transaminases, histology), oxidative stress [liver contents of protein carbonyls, thiobarbituric  reactants, Nrf2 activity and its target mRNA expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NADPH-quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO-1)] and inflammation [nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and its target mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukine-1β (IL-1β)] were studied. RM oil increased liver ALA and its derived EPA and DHA  ' contents, with enhancement in those of α- and γ-tocopherols. IR induced inflammatory liver injury, with enhancement in serum transaminases, oxidative stress-related parameters with reduced Nrf2 signaling, and higher pro-inflammatory cytokines, indexes that were attenuated or abrogated by RM oil pretreatment. It is concluded that RM oil supplementation represents a novel non-invasive preconditioning strategy against liver injury induced by IR that has potential clinical applications in metabolic stress conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27754549>Effect of postharvest methyl jasmonate treatment on   composition and phenolic  content in olive fruits during storage.</a></h1><p>The nutritional effects of both table olives and olive oil are attributed not only to their   but also to antioxidant phenolics such as phenolic . Delays in oil processing usually result in undesirable oxidation and hydrolysis processes leading to formation of free  . These alterations create the need to process oil immediately after olive harvest. However, phenolic content decreases drastically during olive storage resulting in lower quality oil. In the present study we propose postharvest methyl jasmonate treatment as a mean to avoid changes in   composition and losses of phenolic  during olive storage.Contents of   and phenolic  were estimated in methyl jasmonate treated olives throughout 30-day storage, as compared with those of untreated olives. Significant decreases of saturated   were observed in treated samples whereas increases of oleic, linoleic and   were respectively measured (i.e. from 50.8% to 64.5%, from 7.2% to 9.1% and from 1.5% to 9.3%). Also, phenolic  contents increased significantly in treated olives. Particularly, increases of gallic  from 1.35 to 6.29 mg kg , chlorogenic  from 9.18 to 16.21 mg kg , vanillic  from 9.61 to 16.99 mg kg , caffeic  from 5.12 to 12.55 mg kg , p-coumaric  from 0.96 to 5.31 mg kg and ferulic  from 4.05 to 10.43 mg kg were obtained.Methyl jasmonate treatment is proposed as an alternative postharvest technique to traditional methods to guarantee olive oil quality when oil processing is delayed and olive fruits have to necessarily to be stored. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31206695>Comparison of Furans Formation and  Aldehydes Profiles of Four Different Vegetable Oils During Thermal Oxidation.</a></h1><p>The evolution of  aldehydes and the conversion of oxygenated ityβ-unsaturated aldehydes (OαβUAs) into furans were compared in four vegetable oils (soybean oil, olive oil [OVO], peanut oil [PO], and perilla oil [PAO]) thermally oxidized at temperatures of 150, 180, and 210 °C for 10 hr/day over a 3-day period. Results showed that 2 alkyl furans and 23  aldehydes including 4 toxic OdβUAs were detected by GC-MS. The original   compositions of the oils played a key role in the type and concentration of those  compounds. 4-Hydroxy-2-hexenal (HHE) and ethyl furan were only detected in PAO with a high content of , while the greatest level of pentyl furan was detected in PO with abundant linoleic . Greater amounts of 4-hydroxy-(E)-2-nonenal (HNE) and 4-oxo-(E)-2-nonenal (ONE) were formed in the OVO with abundant oleic . The close relativity of HHE and ethyl furan was also demonstrated. With principal component analysis, these vegetable oils could be discriminated based on their   and  compounds. The loading plot confirmed that HHE and ethyl furan were derived from the  oxidation and degradation. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The chemometric results showed that the formation of the  components during heating in different vegetable oils has close correlation with the original   composition of vegetable oils. Our research has also confirmed the presence of toxic OɑβUAs in oils after heating. Considering that they are proven to generate lots of degenerative diseases, further studies are needed to establish the risk level of using certain oils in frying and seek effective methods to inhibit their formation.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27349116>[Lipid synthesis by an acidic  tolerant Rhodotorula glutinis].</a></h1><p>Acetic , as a main by-product generated in the pretreatment process of lignocellulose hydrolysis, significantly affects cell growth and lipid synthesis of oleaginous microorganisms. Therefore, we studied the tolerance of Rhodotorula glutinis to acetic  and its lipid synthesis from substrate containing acetic . In the mixed sugar medium containing 6 g/L glucose and 44 g/L xylose, and supplemented with acetic , the cell growth was not:inhibited when the acetic  concentration was below 10 g/L. Compared with the control, the biomass, lipid concentration and lipid content of R. glutinis increased 21.5%, 171% and 122% respectively when acetic  concentration was 10 g/L. Furthermore, R. glutinis could accumulate lipid with acetate as the sole carbon source. Lipid concentration and lipid yield reached 3.20 g/L and 13% respectively with the initial acetic  concentration of 25 g/L. The lipid composition was analyzed by gas chromatograph. The main composition of lipid produced with acetic  was palmitic , stearic , oleic , linoleic  and , including 40.9% saturated   and 59.1% unsaturated  . The lipid composition was similar to that of plant oil, indicating that lipid from oleaginous yeast R. glutinis had potential as the feedstock of biodiesel production.

The study also aimed to investigate the potentially adverse effects of an unbalanced diet on the distal intestine.Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups of eight animals each and were fed a basal or obesogenic (high in fat and low in fibre) diet that contained either rapeseed oil (Canola) or blackcurrant seed oil. A two-way analysis of variance was then applied to assess the effects of diet and oil and the interaction between them.After 8 weeks, the obesogenic dietary regimen increased the body weight, altered the plasma lipid profile and increased the liver fat content and the plasma transaminase activities. In addition, the obesogenic diet decreased bacterial glycolytic activity and short-chain   formation in the distal intestine. Dietary blackcurrant seed oil improved the lipid metabolism by lowering liver fat accumulation and the plasma triglyceride concentration and atherogenicity as well by increasing the plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration. However, in rats fed an obesogenic diet containing blackcurrant seed oil, the plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration was comparable with both rapeseed oil-containing diets, and a significant elevation of the plasma transaminase activities was noted instead.The obesogenic dietary regimen causes a number of metabolic disorders, including alterations in the hindgut microbial metabolism. Dietary blackcurrant seed oil ameliorates the lipid metabolism; however, the beneficial effect is restricted when it is provided together with the obesogenic diet, and a risk of liver injury may occur.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27878518>Comparative efficacy of  and gamma- to attenuate valproic -induced autism-like features.</a></h1><p>The present study was undertaken to elucidate the effect of  (ALA, 18:3, ω-3) and gamma- (GLA, 18:3, ω-6) on experimental autism features induced by early prenatal exposure to valproic  (VPA) in albino wistar pups. The pups were scrutinized on the accounts of behavioral, biochemical, and inflammatory markers, and the results suggested that the GLA can impart significant protection in comparison to ALA against VPA-induced autism features. When scrutinized histopathologically, the cerebellum of the GLA-treated animals was evident for more marked protection toward neuronal degeneration and neuronal loss in comparison to ALA. Concomitant administration of ALA and GLA with VPA demonstrated a marked cutdown in the Pgp 9.5 expression with GLA having more pronounced effect.

Here we have studied the variability among the major  compounds in virgin olive oil prepared from the progeny of a cross of Picual and Arbequina olive cultivars (Olea europaea L.). The  compounds were isolated by SPME, and analyzed by HRGC-MS and HRGC-FID. Most of the  compounds found in the progeny's oil are produced by the enzymes in the so-called lipoxygenase pathway, and they may be clustered into different groups according to their chain length and polyunsaturated   origin (linoleic and  ). In addition, a group of compounds derived from amino  metabolism and two terpenes also contributed significantly to the  fraction, some of which had significant odor values in most of the genotypes evaluated. The  compound content of the progeny was very varied, widely transgressing the progenitor levels, suggesting that in breeding programs it might be more effective to consider a larger number of individuals within the same cross than using different crosses with fewer individuals.

However, the processes leading to this growth inhibition remain obscure. In this study, we provide evidence for a rapid inhibition of cell hydraulic conductivity (L) by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) in the roots of wild-type Arabidopsis within 0.5 h of 20 and 50 μM MeJA treatments. We also demonstrate that MeJA did not affect L in fad3-2 and fad7-2 Arabidopsis mutants that are deficient in jasmonate precursor, . The reductions of L in wild-type plants were accompanied by the down-regulation of several plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) isoforms, and dephosphorylation. Treatments with HgCl did not further reduce L in the wild-type plants, but significantly reduced L in the fad3-2 and fad7-2 that had been first treated with MeJA. Continuous prolonged exposure to exogenous 50 μM MeJA inhibited the relative growth rates (RGR) of shoots and net photosynthesis (P) in the Arabidopsis wild-type and fad7-2 plants, but had no effect on the RGR of roots. The results demonstrated that a reduction of aquaporin (AQP)-mediated water transport was the initial target of MeJA exposure, and may contribute to the processes of growth inhibition by MeJA.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Pp-oil was obtained by pressing dried seeds at room temperature to give a 47.0% yield of oil. It was then subjected to   composition analysis. The principal   were linoleic  (46.5%), α- (34.4%) and oleic  (13.9%). Then, it was evaluated for its antinociceptive activity in mice, using the acetic -induced abdominal writhing, hot plate and formalin test models. Additionally, its toxicity was determined. The Pp-oil proved to have no toxicological effects, showing dose-dependent antinociceptive effect under chemical stimulation. At oral doses of 25-100 mg/kg, Pp-oil significantly reduced the abdominal writhes in the writhing test. A higher oral dose of 200 mg/kg did not induce alterations in the latency time of the hot plate test when compared to the control, suggesting an analgesic activity of peripheral origin. At oral doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg, the Pp-oil significantly reduced the second phase of the algic stimulus in the formalin test. In addition, the antinociception of Pp-oil was reversed by naloxone in the evaluation of its mechanism of action. Therefore, the Pp-oil proved to be safe at very high doses and to show significant analgesic properties. The role of Pp-oil is still being investigated with respect the mechanism of action, but the results suggest that opiod receptors could be involved in the antinociception action observed for the oil of P. polyadenia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28098834> Compound Profiling by HS-SPME/GC-MS-FID of a Core Olive Cultivar Collection as a Tool for Aroma Improvement of Virgin Olive Oil.</a></h1><p>Virgin olive oil (VOO) is the only food product requiring official sensory analysis to be classified in commercial categories, in which the evaluation of the aroma plays a very important role. The selection of parents, with the aim of obtaining new cultivars with improved oil aroma, is of paramount importance in olive breeding programs. We have assessed the  fraction by headspace-solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-flame ionization detection (HS-SPME/GC-MS-FID) and the deduced aroma properties of VOO from a core set of olive cultivars (Core-36) which possesses most of the genetic diversity found in the World Olive Germplasm Collection (IFAPA Alameda del Obispo) located in Cordoba, Spain. The VOO  fractions of Core-36 cultivars display a high level of variability. It is mostly made of compounds produced from polyunsaturated   through the lipoxygenase pathway, which confirms to be a general characteristic of the olive species ( L.). The main group of  compounds in the oils was six straight-chain carbon compounds derived from , some of them being the main contributors to the aroma of the olive oils according to their odor activity values (OAV). The high level of variability found for the  fraction of the oils from Core-36 and, therefore, for the aroma odor notes, suggest that this core set may be a very useful tool for the choice of optimal parents in olive breeding programs in order to raise new cultivars with improved VOO aroma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30085144>Coleus amboinicus (Lour.) leaves as a modulator of ruminal methanogenesis and biohydrogenation in vitro.</a></h1><p>Active plant metabolites (APM) are recognized as modifiers of ruminal microbial fermentation including methanogenesis and biohydrogenation of   (FA). Coleus amboinicus Lour. leaves (CAL) are rich in several APM, which could serve as ruminal fermentation modulators. A phytochemical analysis showed that CAL contain phenolic  (10.4 mg·g-1 dry matter [DM]; high in rosmarinic ), flavonoids (2.6 mg·g-1 DM), diterpenes (2 mg·g-1 DM), and  (35.4 g (100 g)-1 FA). This study aimed to investigate the effect of CAL on ruminal methanogenesis and biohydrogenation as well as basic fermentation characteristics and microbial populations. The in vitro experiment was carried out using Hohenheim gas test system with 40 mL of buffered ruminal fluid incubated for 24 h at 39 °C in anaerobic conditions. Approximately 400 mg (DM basis) of total mixed ration (TMR) was used as a control substrate and the CAL substrate was used at doses of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg DM replacing equal amounts of TMR. Addition of CAL decreased methane production up to 30% linearly as the amount of CAL increased (P < 0.05). In vitro dry matter digestibility and ammonia tended to increase with increasing doses of CAL. Concentration of total  was not affected by the CAL although there appeared to be a minor positive linear trend; however, acetate, butyrate, and isobutyrate proportion increased quadratically (P < 0.001). CAL tended to linearly increase α- and conjugated linoleic  as well as increased stearic  concentration in buffered ruminal fluid. CAL particularly increased total protozoa and bacterial populations during fermentation, but inhibited methanogens. It is concluded that the CAL may be promising to be used as a feed additive to decrease methanogenesis as well as biohydrogenation of FA in the rumen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27851826>Transcriptional Responses and Gentiopicroside Biosynthesis in Methyl Jasmonate-Treated Gentiana macrophylla Seedlings.</a></h1><p>Gentiana macrophylla, a medicinal plant with significant pharmacological properties, contains the bioactive compound gentiopicroside. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is an effective elicitor for enhancing the production of such compounds. However, little is known about MeJA-mediated biosynthesis of gentiopicroside. We investigated this phenomenon as well as gene expression profiles to determine the molecular mechanisms for MeJA-mediated gentiopicroside biosynthesis and regulation in G. macrophylla. Our HPLC results showed that Gentiana macrophylla seedlings exposed to MeJA had significantly higher concentrations of gentiopicroside when compared with control plants. We used RNA sequencing to compare transcriptional profiles in seedlings treated for 5 d with either 0 μmol L-1 MeJA (C) or 250 μmol L-1 MeJA (M5) and detected differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In total, 77,482 unique sequences were obtained from approximately 34 million reads. Of these, 48,466 (57.46%) sequences were annotated based on BLASTs performed against public databases. We identified 5,206 DEGs between the C and M5 samples, including genes related to the α-lenolenic  degradation pathway, JA signaling pathway, and gentiopicroside biosynthesis. Expression of numerous enzyme genes in the glycolysis pathway was significantly up-regulated. Many genes encoding transcription factors (e.g. ERF, bHLH, MYB, and WRKY) also responded to MeJA elicitation. Rapid acceleration of the glycolysis pathway that supplies precursors for IPP biosynthesis and up-regulates the expression of enzyme genes in that IPP pathway are probably most responsible for MeJA stimulation of gentiopicroside synthesis. Our qRT-PCR results showed that the expression profiles of 12 gentiopicroside biosynthesis genes were consistent with the RNA-Seq data. These results increase our understanding about how the gentiopicroside biosynthesis pathway in G. macrophylla responds to MeJA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572572>Meat quality,  compounds, and antioxidant properties of lambs fed pasture versus mixed diet.</a></h1><p>The aim of the present work was to investigate the effects of feeding regimens (pasture vs. mixed diet) on meat quality,  compounds, and antioxidant properties in lamb meat. In total, 24 lambs were allotted into two feeding regimens at 10.23 kg live weight. Lambs were fed on pasture grass (PG group,  = 12) or mixed diet (M group,  = 12).   (LT) muscle samples from the M group had a higher intramuscular fat (IMF) ( < 0.05), pHvalue ( < 0.01), and ash ( < 0.05) than the PG group. In contrast, the shear force ( < 0.05), L*( < 0.05), and b* ( < 0.001) in M group were lower than in PG group. Analyses indicated that PG group contained higher  (C18:3n3) and docosatrienoic  (C22:3n6) ( < 0.05) than the M group. Major  compounds in the muscles included hexanal, heptanal, nonanal, octanal, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octen-3-ol, and 2,3-octanedione. The levels of hexanal, nonanal, and 2,3-octanedione were significantly lower in PG lamb muscle ( < 0.01). In contrast, 1-pentanol and 1-hexanol levels were higher in M lamb muscle ( < 0.01). Muscle from PG lamb exhibited higher catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity ( < 0.05). PG muscle also contained a higher radical-scavenging ability (RSA;  < 0.001) and cupric-reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC;  < 0.05). Overall, the improved antioxidant status in PG muscle inhibited lipid peroxidation (aldehydes and ketones), thereby improving the meat quality.© 2019 The Authors.

Six soybean cultivars (Giza-21, Giza-22, Giza-35, Giza-82, Giza-83 and Giza-111) were grown under natural infection with cotton leaf worm. The effect of two elicitors, methyl jasmonate and sodium nitroprusside on enhancing the ability of susceptible cultivars to tolerate (Spodoptera littoralis) was studied. Giza-35 and Giza-111 showed tolerance performance under natural infection compared to Giza-22 and Giza-82 as sensitive ones, while Giza-83 and Giza-21 showed moderate tolerance. Both treatments positively affected seed yield and its components and   composition. Extracted   showed variable changes in treated plants compared with the untreated controls. Plants treated with the two elicitors showed an increase in Linoleic  and    and decrease in Palmitic  and Palmitolic  content. Treatment with methyl jasmonate was found to be more effective than sodium nitroprusside and enhanced resistance of the susceptible cultivars. Eight IRAP and iPBS retrotransposon-based markers were used to detect genetic differences among studied soybean cultivars and to develop molecular genetic markers for cotton leaf worm infestation. The technique successfully identified soybean genotypes in addition to nineteen molecular markers related to soybean tolerance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

To further investigate the specificity of LnA's priming effect, we incubated maize seedlings in palmitoleic  (PeicA), γ- (γ LnA) and stearic  (StA) solutions, and analyzed HIPV emission in response to IE. Seedlings incubated in PeicA and γ LnA had 3 and 1.8 times higher HIPV release when compared to controls. In contrast, treatment with StA did not up-regulate HIPV release.

The aim of this study was to increase the health and nutritional values of bioyogurt by using ABT-5 culture and mixing soy milk with buffalo and cow's milk.Five treatments of yogurt were made from soy, buffalo, and cow's milk and from 75% buffalo + 25% soy milk mixture and 75% cow + 25% soy milk mixture using ABT-5 culture.Utilization of soy milk in yogurt production decreased acidity, redox potential (E), total solids (TS), fat, total nitrogen, ash, total  (TVFAs), saturated   (SFAs), monounsaturated   (MUFAs), and total amino  contents. In contrast, the highest levels of unsaturated   (USFAs), polyunsaturated   (PUFAs), linoleic , and α- were detected. Higher numbers of L. acidophilus and bifidobacteria were found in soy milk yogurt than in buffalo or cow's milk. Blending of buffalo or cow's milk with soy milk increased the sensory evaluation scores of yogurt.Mixtures of 25% soy milk + 75% buffalo milk, 25% soy milk + 75% cow's milk and ABT-5 culture could be successfully used in production of bioyogurt characterized by high health and nutritional properties. These optimal combinations highly enhanced probiotic bacteria.

Total gas production was not affected (P > 0.05) by addition of PLE compared to the CON at 24 h of incubation. Methane (CH ) production (mL/250 mg DM) decreased (P < 0.05) with increasing levels of PLE. Acetate to propionate ratio was lower (P <0.05) in MLE (2.02) and HLE (1.93) compared to the CON (2.28). Supplementation of the diet with PLE significantly (P <0.05) decreased the rate of BH of C18:1n-9 (oleic ; OA), C18:2n-6 (linoleic ; LA), C18:3n-3 (; LNA) and C18 polyunsaturated   (PUFA) compared to CON after 24 h incubation, which resulted in higher concentrations of BH intermediates such as C18:1 t11 (vaccenic ; VA), c9t11 conjugated LA (CLA) (rumenic ; RA) and t10c12 CLA. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that the total bacteria, total protozoa, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and methanogen population in HLE decreased (P <0.05) compared to CON, but the total bacteria and B. fibrisolvens population were higher (P < 0.05) in CON compared to the PLE treatment groups.© 2016 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29579972> molecular markers of VOO Thermo-oxidation: Effect of heating processes, macronutrients composition, and olive ripeness on the new emitted aldehydic compounds.</a></h1><p>Heating operation has been applied to Chétoui extra-virgin olive oils (EVOOs) extracted from fruits with several ripening stages (RS). The studied samples, were subjected to microwave and conventional heating. Results showed that heated VOOs after 2.5 h and 7 min of conventional and microwave heating, respectively, gave rise to a drastically decrease of LOX products and allowed the detection of toxic new formed aldehydic volatiles (alkanal: nonanal, alkenals: (Z)-2-heptenal and (E)-2-decenal, and alkadienals: (E.E)-2.4-decadienal), which can be used as markers of VOO degradation. Their abundance in the VOO headspaces depends on their boiling points, the rate of their possible degradation to yield other compounds, on the heating processes and on the rate of macronutrients. The emission rate of the new synthesized volatiles during heating processes was mainly attributed to enzymatic oxidation of some  . Hexanal, (Z)-2-heptenal, (E)-2-octenal, (E)-2-nonenal, (E,E) and (E,Z)-2,4-decadienal, and (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal, derived from linoleic , and heptanol, octanal, nonanal, decanal, (E) and (Z)-2-decenal, (E)-2-undecenal, and (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal, are emitted after degradation of oleic . During thermo-oxidation, the ECN (LLO, and OLnO), and the ECN (OLO, and PLO + SLL) compounds decreased, whereas, the ECN (OOO, and PPO), and the ECN (SOO) compounds increased when temperature and heating time increased. The several variations of the studied biochemical compounds depend to the heating processes. Ripening stage of olive fruits can be used as a tool to monitor the emission rate of the aldehydic volatiles, but cannot be used for a chemometric discrimination.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Comprehensive metabolomics profiling of plants under JA treatment provides insights into the interaction and regulation network of plant hormones. Here we applied high resolution mass spectrometry based metabolomics approach on Arabidopsis wild type and JA synthesis deficiency mutant opr3. The effects of exogenous MeJA treatment on the metabolites of opr3 were investigated. More than 10000 ion signals were detected and more than 2000 signals showed significant variation in different genotypes and treatment groups. Multivariate statistic analyses (PCA and PLS-DA) were performed and a differential compound library containing 174 metabolites with high resolution precursor ion-product ions pairs was obtained. Classification and pathway analysis of 109 identified compounds in this library showed that glucosinolates and tryptophan metabolism, amino  and small peptides metabolism, lipid metabolism, especially  acyls metabolism, were impacted by endogenous JA deficiency and exogenous MeJA treatment. These results were further verified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of 21 related genes involved in the metabolism of glucosinolates, tryptophan and α- pathways. The results would greatly enhance our understanding of the biological functions of JA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31270003>Rubber seed oil and flaxseed oil supplementation alter digestion, ruminal fermentation and rumen   profile of dairy cows.</a></h1><p>Rubber seed oil (RO) that is rich in polyunsaturated   (FA) can improve milk production and milk FA profiles of dairy cows; however, the responses of digestion and ruminal fermentation to RO supplementation in vivo are still unknown. This experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of RO and flaxseed oil (FO) supplementation on nutrients digestibility, rumen fermentation parameters and rumen FA profile of dairy cows. Forty-eight mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows were randomly assigned to one of four treatments for 8 weeks, including basal diet (CON) or the basal dietary supplemented with 4% RO, 4% FO or 2% RO plus 2% FO on a DM basis. Compared with CON, dietary oil supplementation improved the total tract apparent digestibility of DM, neutral detergent fibre and ether extracts ( P 0.05), whereas oil groups significantly changed the    (VFA) profile by increasing the proportion of propionate whilst decreasing total VFA concentration, the proportion of acetate and the ratio of acetate to propionate ( P 0.05). In addition, dietary oil supplementation increased the total unsaturated FA proportion in the rumen by enhancing the proportion of trans-11 C18:1 vaccenic  (VA), cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic  (CLA) and α- (ALA) ( P &lt; 0.05). These results indicate that dietary supplementation with RO and FO could improve nutrients digestibility, ruminal fermentation and ruminal FA profile by enhancing the VA, cis-9, trans-11 CLA and ALA composition of lactating dairy cows. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the application of RO in livestock production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26666272>Study on Synthesis, Characterization and Antiproliferative Activity of Novel Diisopropylphenyl Esters of Selected  .</a></h1><p>The present study describes the synthesis, characterization and evaluation of antiproliferative activity of novel diisopropylphenyl esters of  (ALA), valproic  (VA), butyric  (BA) and 2-ethylhexanoic  (2-EHA). These esters were chemically synthesized by the esterification of   with 2,6-diisopropylphenol and 2,4-diisopropylphenol (propofol). The structure of new conjugates viz. propofol-() (2,6P-ALA and 2,4P-ALA), propofol-valproic  (2,6P-VA and 2,4P-VA), propofol-butyric  (2,6P-BA and 2,4P-BA) and propofol-(2-ethylhexanoic ) (2,6P2-EHA and 2,4P-2-EHA) were characterized by FT-IR, NMR ((1)H, (13)C) and mass spectral data. The synthesized conjugates having more lipophilic character were tested for antiproliferative in vitro studies on A549, MDA-MB-231, HeLa, Mia-Pa-Ca and HePG2 cancer cell lines. All the conjugates showed specific growth inhibition on studied cancer cell lines. Among the synthesized esters, the conjugates synthesized from BA, VA and 2-EHA exhibited prominent growth inhibition against A549, HeLa, Mia-Pa-Ca and HePG2 cancer cell lines. The preliminary results suggest that the entire novel conjugates possess antiproliferative properties that reduce the proliferation of cancer cells in vitro.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26104519>Influence of Sunflower Whole Seeds or Oil on Ruminal Fermentation, Milk Production, Composition, and   Profile in Lactating Goats.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to investigate the effect of sunflower seeds, either as whole or as oil, on rumen fermentation, milk production, milk composition and   profile in dairy goats. Fifteen lactating Damascus goats were divided randomly into three groups (n = 5) fed a basal diet of concentrate feed mixture and fresh Trifolium alexandrinum at 50:50 on dry matter basis (Control) in addition to 50 g/head/d sunflower seeds whole (SS) or 20 mL/head/d sunflower seeds oil (SO) in a complete randomized design. Milk was sampled every two weeks during 90 days of experimental period for chemical analysis and rumen was sampled at 30, 60, and 90 days of the experiment for ruminal pH,  (tVFA), and ammonia-N determination. Addition of SO decreased (p = 0.017) ruminal pH, whereas SO and SS increased tVFA (p<0.001) and acetate (p = 0.034) concentrations. Serum glucose increased (p = 0.013) in SO and SS goats vs Control. The SO and SS treated goats had improved milk yield (p = 0.007) and milk fat content (p = 0.002). Moreover, SO increased milk lactose content (p = 0.048) and feed efficiency (p = 0.046) compared to Control. Both of SS and SO increased (p<0.05) milk unsaturated   content specially conjugated  (CLA) vs Control. Addition of SS and SO increased (p = 0. 021) C18:3N3   compared to Control diet. Data suggested that addition of either SS or SO to lactating goats ration had beneficial effects on milk yield and milk composition with enhancing milk content of healthy   (CLA and omega 3), without detrimental effects on animal performance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25577087>Effect of preprocessing and compressed propane extraction on quality of cilantro (Coriandrum sativum L.).</a></h1><p>Dehydration leads to quality defects in cilantro such as loss in structure, color, aroma and flavor. Solvent extraction with compressed propane may improve the dehydrated quality. In the present study, effect of drying temperature, particle size, and propane extraction on color,  composition, and   composition of cilantro was evaluated. Cilantro was dehydrated (40°C or 60°C), size reduced and separated into three particles sizes, and extracted with compressed propane at 21-27°C. Major  compounds found in dried cilantro were E-2-tetradecenal, dodecanal, E-2-dodecenal, and tetradecanal. Major   were linoleic  and α-. Drying at 60°C compared to 40°C resulted in better preservation of color (decrease in browning index values) and  compounds. Propane extraction led to a positive change in color values and a decrease in  composition, oil content, and   composition.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28865183>Comparison of Chemical Profile and Antioxidant Capacity of Seeds and Oils from Salvia sclarea and Salvia officinalis.</a></h1><p>Composition of tocopherols, tocotrienols, carotenoids,  , as well as hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activities, were determined in seeds of two Salvia species and oils obtained from them. Both seeds contained a large amount of oil (around 20%) rich in polyunsaturated  . While Salvia officinalis seed oil can be classified as oleic-linoleic oil, the predominant   in Salvia sclarea was α- (around 54%). Among tocols, the main isomers in both seeds and oils were γ-tocopherol, followed by α-tocopherol. Concerning carotenoids, their concentration was around 0.75 mg/100 g of seeds and 0.16 mg/100 g of oils, with a predominance of lutein. Oil and seeds of S. officinalis exhibited higher antioxidant potential compared to S. sclarea investigated samples which could be attributed to higher content of total vitamin E and carotenoids. This study provides results that enables use of two Salvia species as new alternative sources of vegetable oils.© 2017 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28928524>Volatiles formation in gelled emulsions enriched in polyunsaturated   during storage: type of oil and antioxidant.</a></h1><p>Gelled emulsions with carrageenan are a novel type of emulsion that could be used as a carrier of unsaturated   in functional foods formulations. Lipid degradation through  compounds was studied in gelled emulsions which were high in polyunsaturated oils (sunflower or algae oil) after 49 days of storage. Aqueous  extract was tested as a natural antioxidant. Analysis of the complete  profile of the samples resulted in a total of 40 compounds, classified in alkanes, alkenes, aldehydes, ketones, , alcohols, furans, terpenes and aromatic hydrocarbons. During storage, the formation of the  compounds was mostly related to the oxidation of the main   of the sunflower oil () and the algae oil (docosahexaenoic ). Despite the antioxidant capacity shown by the  extract, its influence in the oxidative stability in terms of total volatiles was only noticed in sunflower oil gels ( < 0.05), where a significant decrease in the aldehydes fraction was found.</p></html>
