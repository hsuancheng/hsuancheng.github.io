<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26076464>Effects of Acute Supramaximal Cycle Exercise on Plasma FFA Concentration in Obese Adolescent Boys.</a></h2><p>The aims of the present study are 1) to evaluate the free fatty acid (FFA) profile and 2) to determine the relative anaerobic and aerobic contributions to total energy consumption during repeated supramaximal cycling bouts (SCE) in adolescent boys with different body weight statuses.Normal-weight (NW), overweight (OW), and obese (OB) adolescent boys (n =15 per group) completed a SCE sessions consisted of 6 x  maximal sprints with 2 min of passive rest between each repetition. Plasma FFA levels were determined at rest, immediately after a 10 min warm-up, and immediately at the end of SCE. The anaerobic and aerobic contributions (%) were measured via repeated SCE bouts. Insulin resistance was calculated using the homoeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) index.The FFA concentrations measured immediately after SCE were higher in the OB group than in the OW and NW (p<0.01 and p<0.01, respectively) groups. Moreover, the anaerobic contributions to SCE were significantly lower in obese adolescents (p<0.01) and decreased significantly during the 2nd, 3rd and 4th repetitions. The FFA levels were significantly associated with the HOMA-IR index and aerobic contribution among adolescent boys (r=0.83 and r=0.91, respectively, p<0.01).In contrast to the NW and OW groups, there is an increase in lipid mobilization and sift to aerobic energy metabolism during SCE in the OB group.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29463393>Quel pourrait être le futur de la prise en charge de la maladie rénale chronique en nutrition ?</a></h2><p>The nutrition care of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains a central question which is permanently studied. The benefits of a dietary protein restriction are once again enlightened, either by reducing the urea found to be hyperglycemic, thus improving the peripheric  sensitivity, or by decreasing phosphorus and FGF23 hormone, whose reductions are respectively associated with nephroprotection and diminution of cardiovascular events. The numerous researches conducted on the gut microbiota also open promising avenues to better understand the role of this ecosystem in CKD. Finally, the interest in incremental haemodialysis is revived, results show it may be associated with less loss of proteins and preservation of residual kidney function. The development of a nutritional score, informative of survival prediction, also offers the possibility to ensure a better follow-up of patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Despite clear advances in the prevention and treatment of CVD, the impact of T2DM on CVD outcome remains high and continues to escalate. Available evidence indicates that the risk of macrovascular complications increases with the severity of hyperglycemia, thus suggesting that the relation between  disturbances and vascular damage is approximately linear. Although current antidiabetic drugs are highly effective for the management of hyperglycemia, most T2DM patients remain exposed to a substantial and concrete risk of CVD. Over the last decade many glucose-lowering agents have been tested for their safety and efficacy in T2DM with CVD. Noteworthy, most of these studies failed to show a significant benefit in terms of CV morbidity and mortality, despite intensive glycemic control. The recent trials Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME); Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN-6); Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER); and Insulin Resistance Intervention After Stroke (IRIS) have shed some light on this important clinical issue, thus showing a convincing effect of empagliflozin, liraglutide, and pioglitazone on CVD outcomes. Here we provide a critical and updated overview of the main glucose-lowering agents and their risk/benefit ratio for the prevention of CVD in patients with T2DM.Copyright © 2017.
