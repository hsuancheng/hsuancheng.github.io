<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670628>Developing evidence-based behavioural strategies to overcome physiological resistance to  loss in the general population.</a></h1><p>Physiological and behavioural systems are tolerant of excess energy intake and responsive to energy deficits.  loss (WL) changes  structure, physiological function and energy balance (EB) behaviours, which resist further WL and promote subsequent  regain. Measuring and understanding the response of EB systems to energy deficits is important for developing evidence-based behaviour change interventions for longer-term  management. Currently, behaviour change approaches for longer-term WL show modest effect sizes. Self-regulation of EB behaviours (e.g. goal setting, action plans, self-monitoring, relapse prevention plans) and aspects of motivation are important for WL maintenance. Stress management, emotion regulation and food hedonics may also be important for relapse prevention, but the evidence is less concrete. Although much is known about the effects of WL on physiological and psychological function, little is known about the way these dynamic changes affect human EB behaviours. Key areas of future importance include (i) improved methods for detailed tracking of energy expenditure, balance and by subtraction intake, using digital technologies, (ii) how WL impacts  structure, function and subsequent EB behaviours, (iii) how behaviour change approaches can overcome physiological resistance to WL and (iv) who is likely to maintain WL or relapse. Modelling physiological and psychological moderators and mediators of EB-related behaviours is central to understanding and improving longer-term  and health outcomes in the general population.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670172>Reliability and validity of the four-level Chinese emergency triage scale in mainland China: A multicenter assessment.</a></h1><p>An effective emergency triage system is lacking in mainland China. The Chinese Emergency Triage Scale (CETS) was developed based on vital complaints and vital parameters, according to Chinese data.The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of the CETS by emergency department (ED) nurses in eight EDs in mainland China.A cross-sectional multi-center study was conducted.Eight EDs in the eastern, western, northern, and central areas of mainland China.A total of 51 ED nurses and 8000 active ED patients participated in the study between May and September 2018 in eight EDs.Standardized triage scenarios and active patients were assigned to nurses who used the CETS for evaluative purposes. Accuracy was defined by concordance with the key for the scenarios and was calculated as percentages. Inter-rater reliability was measured by weighted κ to compare the triage nurse's rating with the research nurse's acuity level for each patient. The triage time and clinical outcome of 1000 active patients per site also were collected. The criterion-related validity of the CETS was evaluated; criteria included ED mortality, number of patients discharged, and admission to ICU or general ward. The relationship between the CETS acuity levels triaged by the research nurse and four possible outcomes was assessed with a cross-classification table, using a chi-square test. The ability of the CETS to predict ED mortality was assessed via the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC).Mean pooled accuracy from all sites was 89.4% (95% CI = 86.9%-91.8%), and the proportion of over-triage slightly exceeded under-triage (6.5% vs. 4.1%). There was no difference in accuracy between sites or according to nurse experience. Inter-rater reliability values for triage nurses and research nurses were 0.96 (95% CI = 0.95-0.97), based on the quadratic  κ. Trauma cases were assigned to triage with greater accuracy than were nontrauma cases, both for the scenarios and for active patients. The average triage time of ED nurses in all sites was 151.5 ± 26.3 s, using the computer-based triage instrument. The chi-square test showed that there was a significant difference in triage time between the CETS levels (p < 0.001). The AUC was 0.968 (95% CI = 0.958-0.979).The CETS is a reliable system for ED triage and can promote rapid and effective triage in mainland China.Copyright © 2019.

Therefore, we tested if a single bout of CCL increases anabolic signaling and protein synthesis in muscle during normal,  bearing conditions in gastrocnemius muscle from adult and aged rats. Male Brown Norway/F344 rats at 10 (adult) and 30 (aged) months of age were assigned control (CON), or CCL (receiving a single bout of CCL). Twenty-four hours following a single bout of CCL there was no change in protein synthesis, Akt or GSK3β signaling at either age, despite adult rats having higher abundance and activation of mechanosensitive pathways (integrins and integrin linked kinase). Murf-1 was elevated in response to CCL in both age groups potentially indicating muscle remodeling. Muscle from aged rats exhibited an increase in heat shock protein (HSP) 25 and HSP70, and in the cold shock protein RNA binding motif 3 (RBM3) demonstrating a unique stress response to CCL in aged muscle only. Finally, muscle from aged rats exhibited higher basal protein synthesis that was corroborated by elevated eIF2Bε and rpS6 signaling, without an additional effect of CCL. In summary, a single bout of CCL does not have anabolic effects on skeletal muscle during normal,  bearing conditions, even though it has previously been shown to improve regrowth from atrophy. These data demonstrate that interventions that may help recover from atrophy do not necessarily induce muscle hypertrophy in unperturbed conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668932>Z-505, an Oral Ghrelin Receptor Agonist, Attenuates Anorexia After Total Gastrectomy in Rats.</a></h1><p>Anorexia is a serious problem in patients with gastric cancer who have undergone gastrectomy. Ghrelin, an orexigenic hormone primarily secreted from the stomach, has been proposed to prevent anorexia. Significant reduction in plasma ghrelin levels after gastrectomy may contribute to lack of appetite and  loss. In this study, we investigated the effects of Z-505, a ghrelin receptor agonist, on anorexia after total gastrectomy (TG) in a rat model.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish a TG model, and then sham-operated (control) and TG rats were randomly assigned to four subgroups receiving administration of Z-505 (100 mg/kg, p.o., once daily) or vehicle for 14 d from day 14 to day 27 after TG. The food intake, , and fat  were evaluated during the test period. Moreover, the neuronal activity in the hypothalamus was evaluated on day 21 to investigate the mechanism of action of Z-505.In TG rats, Z-505 significantly improved the decrease in cumulative food intake induced by the surgery over 14 d (TG + vehicle; 213.8 ± 15.3 g, n = 12 versus TG + Z-505; 258.2 ± 13.1 g, n = 14, P < 0.05). Z-505 also significantly increased fat  and had a milder effect on  over 14 d. In addition, Z-505 significantly increased the number of c-Fos-positive cells in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (TG + vehicle; 17.8 ± 2.0, n = 12 versus TG + Z-505; 72.2 ± 11.8, n = 12, P < 0.001).Z-505 may be a useful therapeutic treatment for anorexia after TG.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A total of 342, 26-d-old Cobb500 broilers were divided into 5 groups with 6 replicates. Treatments were as follows: (a) Low stocking density (L, 9 birds per cage); (b) High stocking density (H, 12 birds per cage); (c) H + 50 ppm NAM; (d) H + 500 ppm BA; (e) H + 50 ppm NAM + 500 ppm BA (COMB). The results showed that high stocking density significantly reduced the feed intake and  gain of broilers, while COMB improved the growth performance at high stocking density. High stocking density significantly reduced the liver metallothionein content, liver mitochondrial membrane potential and the activities of Na+K+-ATPase and Ca2+Mg2+-ATPase. In contrast, the liver metallothionein contents in the NAM, BA and COMB fed group were higher than those in the H group. COMB increased the activity of ATPase as well, but it failed to enhance the mitochondrial membrane potential. Stocking density also affected gut microbiota of broilers. The high-density group increased the relative abundance of Blautia. Supplementation of BA and NAM increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, respectively. In conclusion, a combination of NAM and BA can improve the performance, antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial function and intestinal microbiota of broilers at high stocking density.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675354>Risk Factors of Nosocomial Infection for Infants in Neonatal Intensive Care Units: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h1><p>BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to identify the nosocomial infection (NI) risk factors in neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU). MATERIAL AND METHODS Databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, VANFUN, CNKI, and VTTMS) were searched using index words to find relevant studies published before November 2018. Meta-analyses of relative risk (RR) were performed for the identification of risk factors. RESULTS Data from 22 cohort studies (2270 infants with and 21 605 infants without NI) were included in the meta-analysis. Infant  of <2500 g (RR: 3.44, 95% CI: 2.31-5.11), gestational age of <37 weeks (RR: 3.85, 95% CI: 1.87-7.92), mechanical ventilation use (RR: 3.16, 95% CI: 2.21-4.50), venipuncture (RR: 3.01, 95% CI: 1.20-7.57), the incidence of asphyxia (RR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.04-2.71), and feeding intolerance (RR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.60-2.81) were identified as the risk factors for the incidence of NI. There was no significant publication bias. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that <2500 g infant , gestational age of <37 weeks, mechanical ventilation utility, venipuncture, asphyxia incidence, and feeding intolerance are the risk factors for NI nosocomial infection in infants in NICU. Appropriate preventive  and targeted interventions are needed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671456>Third Trimester Umbilical Artery Doppler in Low-Risk Pregnancies and its Correlation to Estimated Fetal  and Birthweight.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671318>The Masquelet technique in traumatic loss of the talus after open lateral subtalar dislocation-A case report.</a></h1><p>Subtalar dislocations are rare injuries and treatment recommendations missing. Gross contamination and devascularisation are aspects supporting talectomy as potential treatment choice. Reconstruction in these cases can be challenging. The Masquelet technique presents one viable option.A carpenter sustained a high energy chrush injury with traumatic open lateral talar dislocation qualifying as Gustillo Anderson type IIIc injury, a mangeled extremity index of 7 and gross contamination. The severity of soft tissue damage and contamination prompted the decision for talectomy before plastic coverage with a gracilis flap. Additionally a Masquelet procedure with cement spacer was initiated. After consolidation of the soft tissues a hindfoot arthrodesis with approximate preservation of leg length could be performed. In the course of treatment, the patient suffered no infection and could resume full  bearing after nine months. The patient resumed his previous occupation with adapted workload and is satisfied with the treatment result.In the present case the principle options were talus preservation or talectomy with reconstruction. Talus preservation in the presence of gross contamination can be associated with the risk of infection, in addition there is a risk to develop secondary arthritis. For this individual patient the a fast and definite solution was important at this point in life. Surgeons therefore opted for talectomy. To optimally reconstruct leg length and optimize for arthrodesis the Masquelet technique was employed.The Masquelet technique is a viable option also in the emergency situation to preserve extremity length and optimize tissue viability.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

This study makes use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to 1) examine differences in the contextual factors, including location, food preparation style, people present, presence of media devices, and overall atmosphere, between meal and snack occasions; and 2) explore differences in the context of snacking occasions across children's gender and  status. Data for the current study came from the Family Matters Study, which included 150 families with children aged 5-7 years old (n = 25 from each of the following groups: Black/African American, Hispanic, Hmong, Native American, Somali, White). Parents completed an 8-day EMA observation period, during which they were surveyed after each eating occasion with the study child; questions explored contextual factors including location, food preparation style, people present, presence of media devices, and the overall atmosphere of each eating occasion. Differences between meals and snacks were observed; a smaller percentage of snacks (compared to meals) were prepared by the parent, consisted of only homemade food, and were planned ahead of time, as opposed to being served in response to a child's request. Snacks were more likely than other meals to be eaten on the couch and in the presence of a screen. Furthermore, important differences in snacking context were observed by child gender and  status. Findings illuminate opportunities to improve children's overall dietary intake via interventions focused on improving the quality of foods served during snacks, as well as the contextual environment in which snacks are eaten.Copyright © 2019.

There was a difference in PA (mesor) between groups of women who lost  compared to those who gained  ( = 0.007). There was a relationship between IS and PA parametres mesor: p0.001; and the most active 10 h of a day (M10):  < 0.001 - the more stable were women in their rhythm, the more PA they have. Besides confirming a relationship between PA and WL, we also found a relation between WL and CP based on acrophase. Although no direct relationship was found for the indicators of rhythm stability (IS), they can be considered very important variables because of their close connection to PA - a main factor that contributes to the success of the WL programme.According to the results of the study, screening of the CP and its stability may be beneficial in the creation of an individualized WL plan.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671669>Study on Spatial and Temporal Distribution Characteristics of Coordinated Development Degree among Regional Water Resources, Social Economy, and Ecological Environment Systems.</a></h1><p>Water resources utilization, social economy development, and ecological environment protection are key factors in regional sustainable development. Scientific evaluation of regional coordinated development status and diagnosis of regional uncoordinated development constraints will improve the management level of decision-makers. At present, most developing countries have the problem of unbalanced regional development caused by the one-sided pursuit of a certain system. Taking 14 prefecture-level cities in Hunan Province as cases, this paper analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of the carrying capacity level of the water resources system, the development level of the social economy system and the protection level of the ecological environment system in each evaluation unit based on entropy  method and order parameter analysis. Based on the theory of coordinated development, a calculation model of a coordinated development degree was constructed, and the corresponding evaluation criteria were formulated. The spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of a coordinated development degree in each research unit were analyzed and evaluated. The results showed that the average coordinated development degree of Hunan Province from 2004 to 2016 evolved from "Light disorder recession" to "Nearly disorder recession", then to "Reluctance coordinated development". Restricted by different systems, the coordinated development degree in each research unit presented spatial and temporal differences. According to different development stages and the characteristics of different regions, corresponding development strategies can be formulated to provide the guidance for coordinated the development of regions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673888>The protective effect of quercetin in the alcohol-induced liver and lymphoid tissue injuries in newborns.</a></h1><p>Recently published experimental and clinical studies indicate that oxidative stress leads to the pathogenesis and progression of alcohol-induced tissue injuries. Quercetin is a type of flavonoid compound that influences antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities have protective and therapeutic effects for treating various diseases including diabetes mellitus and neuro-degenerative diseases. In this study, fetal alcohol syndrome was tested in rat models, with the aim of verifying the protective effect of quercetin in preventing alcohol-induced liver and lymphoid tissue (thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes) injuries on the 21st day for the offspring of alcohol treated mother rats. The pregnant rats were randomly assigned into four groups. The control group (C) (n = 3) of pregnant rats received only physiological saline intraperitoneally (i.p.) throughout the pregnancy (1 to 21 days gestation) and during lactation until postnatal day 21. The quercetin positive control group (QT) of pregnant rats (n = 3) received quercetin at 50 mg/kg/days i.p. for the same period. The ethanol treatment group (E) (n = 3) of pregnant rats received 1 ml/day of 40% v/v ethanol (4 g/kg) intragastrically (i.g) for the same period. The model group of pregnant rats (EQ) received ethanol + quercetin (n = 3) with a dose of 1 ml/day of v/v ethanol (4 g/kg i.g.) and quercetin at 50 mg/kg  per day i.p. for the same period. Ten offspring were used in each of the C, QT, E and EQ groups. Malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl content (PC) and chemiluminescence levels (CL) in liver and lymphoid tissues significantly increased in group E versus the C group (P < 0.05-P < 0.001) whereas glutathione levels (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GP), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities significantly decreased in group E compared to the C group (P < 0.05-< 0.001). However, tissue MDA, PC, and CL levels decreased in the EQ group compared to group E. GSH level, GP, GR, SOD, and CAT activity were significantly increased by quercetin (P < 0.05-P < 0.001). The plasma TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels and NF-κB activation significantly increased in group E compared to the C and QT groups, but IL-10 significantly decreased in group E compared to the C and QT groups. The TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels and NF-κB activation significantly decreased in group EQ compared to group E. In conclusion, quercetin has a protective effect against maternal alcohol-induced oxidative and inflammatory damage in the liver and lymphoid tissues of newborn rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672028>Rivaroxaban Versus Warfarin for Stroke Prevention and Venous Thromboembolism Treatment in Extreme Obesity and High .</a></h1><p> Limited clinical data exist describing the use of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with  mass index (BMI) >40 kg/m or  >120 kg. Thus, DOAC therapy in this population remains controversial.  To investigate rivaroxaban as a safe and effective alternative to warfarin for venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment and prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation identified as extremely obese or of high .  A retrospective chart review was performed at 2 academic medical centers in patients ≥18 years old and BMI >40 kg/m or  >120 kg, newly initiated on warfarin or rivaroxaban for atrial fibrillation or VTE treatment. The primary end point was incidence of clinical failure, defined as VTE recurrence, stroke incidence, and mortality, within 12 months of initiation. Secondary end points included length of stay (LOS) and bleeding complications.  A total of 176 patients were included, with 84 and 92 patients in the rivaroxaban and warfarin arms, respectively. Clinical failure was lower in the rivaroxaban group but did not reach statistical significance when compared with warfarin (5% vs 13%;  = 0.06).

We investigated the safety of naringenin, its effects on metabolic rate, and blood glucose and insulin responses in a single female subject with diabetes. The subject ingested 150 mg naringenin from an extract of whole oranges standardized to 28% naringenin three times/day for 8 weeks, and maintained her usual food intake. , resting metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, and blood chemistry panel including glucose, insulin, and safety markers were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Adverse events were evaluated every 2 weeks. We also examined the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase G (PKG) in the response of human adipocytes to naringenin treatment. Compared to baseline, the  decreased by 2.3 kg. The metabolic rate peaked at 3.5% above baseline at 1 h, but there was no change in the respiratory quotient. Compared to baseline, insulin decreased by 18%, but the change in glucose was not clinically significant. Other blood safety markers were within their reference ranges, and there were no adverse events.  and  mRNA expression was reduced by inhibitors of PPAR and PPAR, but there was no effect of PKA or PKG inhibition. We conclude that naringenin supplementation is safe in humans, reduces  and insulin resistance, and increases metabolic rate by PPAR and PPAR activation.

It is unclear what walking speeds and durations significantly affect plantar tissue viability and risks for foot ulcers in non-diabetics and diabetics.The aim of this study was to establish the normal response of plantar skin blood flow to different speeds and durations of walking exercise in non-diabetics that would be needed to quantify impaired responses in diabetics.Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure plantar skin blood flow of the first metatarsal head in 12 non-diabetics. A 3 × 2 factorial design, including 3 speeds (slow at 3 km/h, moderate at 6 km/h, and fast at 9 km/h) and 2 durations (10 and 20 min), was used in this study. Skin blood flow after walking was expressed as a ratio of skin blood flow before walking. The 3 × 2 two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated  was used to examine the main effects of speeds and durations and their interaction.The walking speed significantly affected skin blood flow responses (p < 0.01). Walking at 9 km/h significantly increased plantar skin blood flow (5.71 ± 1.89) compared to walking at 6 km/h (2.1 ± 0.29) and 3 km/h (1.16 ± 0.14), especially at 20-minute walking duration (p < 0.01). The walking duration showed a trend of significance on affecting skin blood flow responses (p = 0.06). There was no significant interaction between walking speeds and durations (p > 0.05).Our results provide the first evidence that walking speeds affect plantar skin blood flow and a fast walking speed (9 km/h) significantly increases plantar skin blood flow compared to moderate (6 km/h) and slow (3 km/h) walking speeds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The drugs used to treat these conditions are largely inadequate or dangerous, and a well-researched approach based on nutraceuticals would be highly useful. Pterostilbene (Pt), i.e., 3,5-dimethylresveratrol, has been reported to be effective in animal models of obesity, acting on different metabolic pathways. We investigate here its ability to induce browning of white adipose tissue. Pt (5 µM) was first tested on 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes, and then it was administered (352 µmol/kg/day) to mice fed an obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) for 30 weeks, starting at weaning. In the cultured adipocytes, the treatment elicited a significant increase of the levels of Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1) protein-a key component of thermogenic, energy-dissipating beige/brown adipocytes. In vivo administration antagonized  increase, more so in males than in females. Analysis of inguinal White Adipose Tissue (WAT) revealed a trend towards browning, with significantly increased transcription of several marker genes (, , , , , and ) and an increase in UCP1 protein levels, which, however, did not achieve significance.

In this study, the strain WR10 was used for relieving abiotic stresses in wheat under low phosphorus and high saline in hydroponic co-culture models. Significantly, strain WR10 improved wheat seed relative germination rate under salinity stress (200/400 mM NaCl) and the root dry  in wheat seedlings under phosphorus stress (10 μM KHPO) when insoluble phosphates are available. To provide insights into its abiotic stress-alleviating properties, the strain was characterized further. WR10 grows well under different culture conditions. Particularly, WR10 resists salt (12% NaCl) and hydrolyzes both inorganic and organic insoluble phosphates. WR10 uses many plant-derived substrates as sole carbon and energy sources. It produces catalase, amylase, phosphatase, phytase, reductase, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase. In addition, WR10 possesses long peritrichous flagella, and its biofilm formation, as well as phytase production, is induced by abiotic stresses. Overall, the salinity-alleviating property of WR10 in wheat can be attributed to its inherent tolerance to NaCl, formation of biofilm, and production of enzymes, like catalase, amylase, and ACC deaminase. Meanwhile,  WR10 reduces low-phosphorus stress in wheat by production of phosphatases and phytases in the presence of insoluble phosphates.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673530>The Effects of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Analog and a Combination of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Analog and Recombinant Human Growth Hormone on Adult Height in Girls with Early Puberty.</a></h1><p>Early puberty (EP) is due to the activation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator in lower ages; EP may be a potential cause for impairment of adult height, leading to short stature. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of GnRH analog (GnRHa) and GnRHa plus recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment on final height in healthy girls with EP.Fifty EP girls (sexual maturity rating: 2-3) with chronological age (CA) 9.22 ± 0.56 and bone age (BA) 9.74 ± 0.59 years were treated with GnRHa (Triptorelin) at a dose of 100 μg/kg  (BW) as intramuscular every 28 days for 2.82 ± 0.57 years; 45 EP girls with CA 9.84 ± 0.57 and BA 10.14 ± 1.02 years were also treated with the same GnRHa plus rhGH (Norditropin) at a dose of 0.1 unit/kg BW daily for 6 days in a week for 2.55 ± 0.6 years. In the control group, 33 EP girls followed for the same period without treatment. Height, , and  mass index of girls and parents were assessed. Predicted adult height (PAH) at the start and the end of the study and target height were assessed.PAH at the end of the study in the GnRHa group was not different with untreated girls. PAH at the end of the treatment in GnRHa plus rhGH group was significantly higher than both untreated and GnRHa group. PAH at the end of therapy in GnRHa plus rhGH group was significantly more than their target height.GnRHa therapy has a benefit effect in achievement of target height. Combination therapy with GnRHa plus rhGH increased their PAH more than both untreated and GnRHa groups.Copyright: © 2019 Advanced Biomedical Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669568>Production of chitosan-oligosaccharides by the chitin-hydrolytic system of Trichoderma harzianum and their antimicrobial and anticancer effects.</a></h1><p>Chitosan-oligosaccharides (COS) are low-molecular  chitosan derivatives with interesting clinical applications. The optimization of both COS production and purification is an important step in the design of an efficient production system and for the exploration of new COS applications. Trichoderma harzianum is an innocuous biocontrol agent that represents a novel biotechnological tool due to the production of extracellular enzymes, including those that produce a COS mixture. In this work, we propose different systems for the production of COS using the T. harzianum chitinolitic system. A complete qualitative and quantitative analysis of a partially purified COS mixture were performed. Also, an evaluation of the anticancer and antimicrobial effects of the COS mixture was carried out. Three chitosan variants (colloidal, solid and solution) and two fungus stages (spores and mycelia) were tested for COS production. The best system consisted of the interaction of the solid chitosan and the fungal spores, producing a COS mixture containing species from the monomer to the hexamer, in a concentration range of 7-238 mg/mL, according to chromatographic analysis. The proposed purification method isolated the monomer and the dimer from the COS mixture. Moreover, the COS mixture has an inhibitory effect on the growth of bacteria and changes the morphology of yeasts. As anticancer compounds, COS inhibited the growth of cervical cancer cells at concentration of 4 mg/mL and significantly reduced the survival rate of the cells. In conclusion, T. harzianum proved to be an efficient system for COS mixture production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Both VLBW (401-1500 g or 22-29 weeks of gestation) and non-VLBW (>1500 g and >29 weeks) infants had diagnoses or anatomic descriptors consistent with ectopia cordis and/or pentalogy of Cantrell. The primary outcome was neonatal survival, defined as hospital discharge or initial length of stay of ≥12 months.In total, 180 infants had ectopia cordis, 135 (76%) with findings of pentalogy of Cantrell. VLBW infants comprised 52% of the population. VLBW mortality was 96% with 79% dying within 12 hours, compared with 59% and 36%, respectively, for non-VLBW. One-third of VLBW infants received life support compared with 65% of non-VLBW. Surgery was reported for 34% of VLBW and 68% of non-VLBW infants. Congenital heart disease was reported in 8% of VLBW and 36% of non-VLBW, with conotruncal abnormalities most common. Survival exceeded 50% for infants >2500 g and >37 weeks of gestation.Survival of VLBW infants with ectopia cordis was poor and substantially worse compared with non-VLBW, with notable discrepancies in resuscitative efforts and surgical interventions. Although gestational age and  strongly influence current survival, more detailed information regarding the severity of cardiac and noncardiac abnormalities is required to fully determine prognosis and inform counseling.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to assess the potential links between stocking densities and feeding methods with social and individual stress responses on juvenile seabream (Sparus aurata) through risk-taking and hypoxia tests. Seabream was first experimentally reared under two different densities: high (HD: 11-65 kg m) and low (LD: 3-15 kg m). After 120 days under these conditions, increment in fish  was not affected by different stocking densities. HD seemed to induce a stronger schooling behavior on seabream juveniles seeking for the group safety during the risk test; while LD increased the mean number of movements per fish recorded and the time of first response. Additionally, HD conditions delayed the time of first response of proactive fish during hypoxia tests. Glucose levels were higher in reactive fish compared to proactive ones, being highly significant in fish reared at HD. In parallel, juvenile seabream was also experimentally reared for 106 days under two different feeding strategies: hand-feeding (HF) and self-demanding feeding (DF), which influenced fish growth and foraging behavior at group and individual level. HF method induced a positive effect on fish  compared to DF systems. Time of first response during both hypoxia and risk-taking tests was shorter in HF fish than DF fish, and the mean number of movements per fish during risk-taking behavior tests was lower for DF fish compared to HF fish. No differences were found in glucose and cortisol concentrations between behavioral traits (proactive/reactive) and feeding strategies. Triggering actions of seabream in DF systems were also assessed, which seemed to be highly dependent on particular individuals and not related to proactive individuals. DF systems however reinforce the social hierarchy within the fish group, which might lead to a higher competitiveness for resources among fishes, increasing the social hierarchy, and therefore, the stress. The findings of this study provide valuable information to the industry for the management of fish stress and welfare under production conditions at social and individual level.Copyright © 2019.

AmB loaded PEGylated NLC (AmB-PEG-NLC) were fabricated by hot-melt emulsification followed by high-pressure homogenization (HPH) technique. 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)] (mPEG-2K-DSPE) was used for surface PEGylation. mPEG-DSPE with different PEG molecular , 1K, 2K, 5K, 10K, and 20K, were screened for formulation stability. Furthermore, the AmB loaded PEGylated (2K) NLC (AmB-PEG2K-NLC) was optimized using Box-Behnken design with respect to the amount of AmB, castor oil, mPEG-2K-DSPE, and number of high-pressure homogenization cycles as the factors; particle size, zeta potential, PDI, entrapment efficiency, and loading efficiency as responses. Stability of the optimized AmB-PEG2K-NLC was assessed over 4 weeks, at 4°C as well as 25°C and effect of autoclaving was also evaluated. AmB-PEG2K-NLC were tested for their in vitro antifungal activity against Candida albicans (ATCC 90028), AmB resistant Candida albicans (ATCC 200955) and Aspergillus fumigatus (ATCC 204305). Cytotoxicity of AmB-PEG2K-NLC was studied in human retinal pigmented epithelium cells. In vivo ocular biodistribution of AmB was evaluated in rabbits, following topical application of PEGylated NLCs or marketed AmB preparations. PEGylation with mPEG-2K-DSPE prevented leaching of AmB and increased the drug load significantly. The optimized formulation was prepared with a particle size of 218 ± 5 nm; 0.3 ± 0.02 PDI, 4.6 ± 0.1% (w/w) drug loading, and 92.7 ± 2.5% (w/w) entrapment efficiency. The optimized colloidal dispersions were stable for over a month, at both 4°C and 25°C. AmB-PEG2K-NLCs showed significantly (p<0.05) better antifungal activity in both wild-type and AmB resistant Candida strains and, was comparable to, or better than, commercially available parenteral AmB formulations like Fungizone and AmBisome®. AmB-PEG2K-NLC did not show any toxicity up to a highest concentration of 1% (v/v) (percent formulation in medium). Following topical instillation, AmB was detected in all the ocular tissues tested and statistically significant (p>0.05) difference was not observed between the formulations tested. An optimized autoclavable and effective AmB-PEG2K-NLC ophthalmic formulation with at least one-month stability, in the reconstituted state, has been developed.Copyright © 2019.

However, it is unclear whether a human opponent is necessary, as the same benefits may be achievable with a "human-like" computer-controlled opponent or a human who talks to the player without playing the game. Our objective was to compare four opponent types in a competitive exercise game: a simple computer opponent, "human-like" computer opponent, human opponent, and a simple computer opponent accompanied by a player-selected human who chats with the player.  Sixteen participants (3 women, 24.4 ± 7.7 years old) played a competitive arm exercise game in the above four conditions. Exercise intensity was measured with inertial sensors, and four motivation scales were measured with the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory. After playing, participants answered several questions regarding their preferences.  The human opponent was the favorite for 14 of 16 participants and resulted in the highest interest/enjoyment and exercise intensity. All participants preferred the human opponent over the computer opponent accompanied by a human companion. Finally, 12 of 16 participants preferred the "human-like" computer opponent over the simple one.  Our results have two implications for competitive exercise games. First, they indicate that developing computer-controlled opponents with more human-like behavior is worthwhile, but that the best results are achieved with human opponents. Second, social interaction without in-game interaction does not provide an enjoyable, intense experience. However, our results should be verified with different target populations for exercise games.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673860>Assessment of toxic interaction of nano zinc oxide and nano copper oxide on germination of Raphanus sativus seeds.</a></h1><p>Multiple applications of nanoparticles (NPs) could result in their potential release into agricultural systems and raised concerns about food safety. The NPs once released in the environment may interact with numerous pollutants, including other NPs. Present study assessed the impact of a single (CuO and ZnO NPs) and binary mixture (CuO+ZnO NPs) on the germination of Raphanus sativus seeds with a wide range of exposure concentration (0-1000 mg/L). Both the NPs have shown a deleterious effect on seeds at exposure concentration greater than 10 mg/L. Antagonistic interaction between effects of CuO and ZnO NPs on seeds was noticed for all the exposed concentrations. CuO NPs showed higher absorption capacity on the seedling surface than ZnO NPs. Internal uptake of Zn in ZnO NP-exposed seedlings was found to be greater than that due to CuO NP-exposed seedlings. Three different types of exposure adversely affected seed germination (reduction in root length, shoot length, and fresh ). Reduction in growth parameters (length and ) with concentration was compared using log-logistic dose-response model of "DRC" package of the "R" software, and EC was determined. As per EC values, the toxicity of CuO NPs was found to be maximum followed by CuO+ZnO NPs and then minimum for ZnO NPs. Seedlings accumulated Cu and Zn metals, and higher uptake was recorded for Zn (reported as mg/g seedling dry ). The order of toxicity was found as CuO NPs > binary mixture (CuO+ZnO) NPs > ZnO NPs. Exposure concentration greater than 10 mg/L resulted in significant toxicity and uptake in germinated seedlings. These findings indicated that exposure of the mixture of NPs during germination might give different effects and thus, further attempts could prove quite beneficial to the literature.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673690>Prediction of recurrent preterm delivery in asymptomatic women- an anxiety reducing measure?</a></h1><p>The QUiPP application is used to predict the risk of recurrent preterm birth (PTB) in asymptomatic high risk women with a previous PTB. Our study aims to evaluate the impact of the use of the QUiPP app on maternal anxiety levels.A retrospective cohort study on asymptomatic pregnant women attending the Prevention of Preterm Birth Clinic in a busy tertiary unit. Women included in the study had a history of previous PTB. The study assessment occurred at approximately 4 weeks prior to the gestation of the earliest previous PTB and included measurement of cervical length and vaginal fetal fibronectin. Data was inputted into the QUiPP application, which in turn estimated risk of preterm delivery at specific intervals. Measured outcomes were gestation at delivery, time from risk assessment to delivery, infant birth , NICU admission and length of stay. In addition, maternal anxiety levels were retrospectively assessed using a questionnaire with a Likert scale.Seventy six women were included in the study. All women were asymptomatic for preterm labour at assessment. The mean gestation at the time of risk assessment was 27 weeks, the mean time from risk assessment to delivery was 72 days. Average gestation at time of delivery was 37 weeks (range 22-42 weeks). The preterm birth rate was 29% (n = 22).Seventy seven percent of women who delivered <37 weeks, and 80% who delivered <34 weeks were given QUiPP scores predicting a ≥5% chance of PTB within four weeks of their actual delivery date. Sixteen percent of infants were admitted to NICU (n = 12) with a mean length of stay of 21 days. All infants went home well with their parents.Eighty four percent of respondents to our questionnaire reported feeling anxious about their pregnancy prior to attending the clinic. After receiving a QUIPP score 90% said they felt reassured and 79% reported that the felt less anxious.In asymptomatic women, the use of the QUiPP app helps to predict, prevent, and optimise PTB. This surveillance has a beneficial role for maternal mental well-being in that it reduces anxiety at a key time during a pregnancy.© 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670366>Collaborative effects of chlorogenic acid and caffeine on lipid metabolism via the AMPKα-LXRα/SREBP-1c pathway in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.</a></h1><p>To investigate the mechanism of the combined effects of chlorogenic acid (CGA) and caffeine on lipid metabolism in high-fat diet-induced obese mice, eighty female ICR mice were randomly divided into eight groups and fed with a high-fat diet with/without CGA and/or caffeine for 14 weeks. The combination of CGA and caffeine effectively decreased  gain, intraperitoneal adipose tissue , serum LDL-c, FFA, TC, TG, leptin, IL-6 concentrations, and hepatic TG and TC levels and increased the serum adiponectin level. The CGA and caffeine combination also promoted the phosphorylation of AMPKα, inhibited the expressions of transcriptional regulators (SREBP-1c and LXRα), and decreased the expressions of FAS and HMGR. Besides, the expressions of ACO, ATGL and HSL were increased by the CGA and caffeine combinations. The results indicated that the combination of CGA and caffeine had anti-obesity effects and regulated lipid metabolism in high-fat diet-induced obese mice via the AMPKα-LXRα/SREBP-1c signaling pathway.

Despite their popularity, very little is known about the biology of zebrafish in their natural habitat. This may, in part, be due to the difficulties associated with undertaking field trips to the remote areas of northern India, Nepal, and Bangladesh, which is the natural distribution range of zebrafish. Here, we present a field report describing a recent trip where we, together with local collaborators, visited several rivers in West Bengal, India, to observe wild zebrafish and their habitat. We present an overview of our observations on the biology of wild zebrafish, and the great variability of the different environments where they were found. We also include data collected on water chemistry parameters at 12 zebrafish sites, and  data and photos of fish from these sites. We present extensive underwater videos of wild zebrafish and photographs of the sites, including video footage of courtship behavior. We show that the breeding period of wild zebrafish can be extended from the previous record of April-August to April-October. In addition, we provide practical advice for future zebrafish expeditions to this rural and inaccessible area. The goals of this article are to shed some light on the ecology of wild zebrafish, and to facilitate scientists in their future research trips. We hope that by observing zebrafish in the wild, we can increase our understanding of the natural ecology of this important model organism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671534>Highly Conductive and Flexible Gel Polymer Electrolyte with Bis(Fluorosulfonyl)imide Lithium Salt via UV Curing for Li-Ion Batteries.</a></h1><p>A series of new self-standing gel polymer electrolytes (SGPEs) were fabricated by ultraviolet (UV) curing and investigated for application in flexible lithium-ion batteries. Compared with traditional gel polymer electrolytes (combine with solvents or plasticizers), these new SGPEs were prepared simply by curing different  ratios of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) with a methacrylic linear monomer, poly (ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA). Noticeably, there were no solvents or plasticizers combined with the final SGPEs. Owing to this, the SGPEs showed high flexibility and strong mechanical stability. Some paramount physicochemical and electrochemical characters were observed. The SGPEs demonstrated good thermal stability below 150 °C and an extremely low glass transition temperature () (around -75 °C). Moreover, plastic crystal behaviors were also identified in this study. Ultimately, the SGPEs demonstrated excellent ionic conductivity at room temperature, which proves that these new SGPEs could be widely applied as a prospective electrolyte in flexible lithium-ion batteries.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673451>26-Week Repeated Dose Oral Toxicity Study of KCHO-1 in Sprague-Dawley Rats.</a></h1><p>KCHO-1(Mecasin), also called Gamijakyakgamchobuja-tang originally, is a combination of some traditional herbal medicines in East Asia.

Although the subjective cure rate was similar in both groups at the 6 week and 6 month follow up (65% vs. 75%; 75% vs. 80%) (p>0.05), the objective cure rate was significantly higher in the TOT group than in the VC group, as expected (10% vs. 80%; 30% vs. 75%) (p<0.05).The main treatment of SUI is surgery; however, VC could be offered as an alternative treatment for women who refuse surgery, those at high risk for surgery or it could be used temporarily before surgery.©Copyright 2019 by Turkish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology | Turkish Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology published by Galenos Publishing House.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670174> gain, feeding and eating in the first year of life of babies of smoking and non-smoking mothers.</a></h1><p>Babies of mothers who smoke during pregnancy tend to be born underweight but are at risk for pediatric obesity. Maternal feeding practices, maternal disordered eating, and child temperament were assessed as potential mediators of early  gain in babies of smoking and non-smoking mothers. The BMIs of babies of 88 smoking and 107 non-smoking mothers were recorded at birth and reported one year later. Mothers self-reported on disordered eating and child feeding practices, and on their infants' temperament. Babies of smoking mothers had lower BMI at birth but not at age one. For babies of non-smoking but not for those of smoking mothers, BMI at birth predicted BMI at age one. Smoking mothers' disordered eating and pressure for children to eat predicted their babies' BMI at age one. In the non-smoking group only, there were significant correlations between babies' temperamental difficulties and babies' BMI at age one. In contrast to non-smoking mothers, smoking mothers tend to pressure their babies to eat, and not to feed them in response to their distress. This interim picture may provide insight into the transition of the children of smoking mothers from underweight newborns to children classified as overweight.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It became the "gold standard" for preservation of beautiful, dry biological specimens. Near the end of the 21st century, a group from the University of Michigan and environs and Dow Corning™, USA, combined silicone ingredients, similar to the von Hagens' plastination products, however in a different sequence. The new polymer (Cor-tech) was combined with the cross-linker to design the "impregnation mix" which would invade the cellular structure of the specimen and yet was stable at room temperature. Later, curing would be by application of the catalyst onto the impregnated specimen. This unique sequencing of products would become the "Room temperature/Dow Corning™/Corcoran-Silicone plastination technique." The results of this room temperature technique provided similar plastinates, beautiful and practical for demonstration, containing no toxic chemical residues and forever preserved. As the name implies, impregnation of this silicone mix could be done at room temperature, without having to be kept cold. Both processes (cold and room temperature) required the same four basic steps for plastination. As well, both processes used similar basic polymers and additives to produce plastinates. However, they were combined in a different sequence. Cold temperature combines polymer and catalyst/chain extender, which is not stable and therefore must be kept colder than -15°C, while room temperature combines polymer with cross-linker which is stable, and likely forever.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674716>Environmental Goals Addressed in Assessments of Contaminated Sediments.</a></h1><p>Environmental management often aims at sustainability and at implementing goals such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Several of these goals rely upon healthy sediments, implying that contaminated sediments need to be addressed in environmental management. In Sweden, the SDGs and national environmental objectives are meant to be central in environmental management. However, in Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) for contaminated sediments, it is not clear to assessors or authorities in Sweden which goals to consider and how. In the current study, we explore which environmental goals ERAs of contaminated sediment should consider, according to representatives from Swedish authorities, and to what extent ERAs consider those goals in practice in Sweden. The identified goals indicated that protection of aquatic ecosystems and associated services is a main priority for the authorities. The ERAs analyzed showed that most identified goals were addressed, albeit not consistently. Furthermore, risk assessors seem to put less  on ecological aspects than authorities do. This indicates that authorities need to stress the importance of environmental aspects and provide guidance on how to address them. Several environmental goals were found to be directly relevant to contaminated sediments and ERAs can contribute to their fulfillment, as ERA is a basis for management decisions. However, practitioners need clearer guidance on which goals to address and how. Finally, there seems to be good potential for implementation of the SDGs in environmental management in Sweden, due to existing legislation based on sustainable development and well-anchored national environmental objectives that overlap with the SDGs.

Poultry products contaminated with this pathogen is one of the major sources of infections in humans. Outer membrane protein C (OmpC) of Salmonella Typhimurium is a promising DNA vaccine candidate to mitigate Salmonella infection in poultry. However, the large-scale production of bioactive recombinant OmpC (rOmpC) protein is hindered due to the formation of inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. The objective of this work was to attain high level expression of rOmpC protein, purify and evaluate its functional properties. The ompC gene was optimized and fused with small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) gene for high level expression as soluble protein. The fusion protein with ~58 kDa molecular  was observed on SDS-PAGE gel. The expression levels of rOmpC fusion protein reached maximum of 38% of total soluble protein (TSP) after 8 h of 0.2% rhamnose induction. Protein purification was carried out using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) purification column. Western blot were performed to analyse expression and immunoreactivity of rOmpC fusion protein. The results indicate that SUMO fusion system is ideal for large scale production of functional rOmpC fusion protein expression in E. coli.Copyright © 2019.

Despite the critical role of the taste system in determining food selection and consumption, the effects of chronic sucrose consumption on the peripheral taste system in mammals have received limited attention. We offered female Sprague Dawley rats free access to water and one of three diets for up to 40 days: (1) sucrose-free chow or "NS" diet; (2) a high-sucrose dry diet or "HS"; or (3) 30% sucrose solution and the NS diet, designated "LiqS" diet. Sucrose consumption by LiqS rats gradually increased and by day 14 was equal to that of HS rats. Food intake decreased in LiqS rats, but their energy intake remained higher than for NS or HS rats. There was no significant difference in  gain of the groups during the study. Recordings from the chorda tympani nerve (CT), which innervates taste buds on the anterior tongue, revealed decreased responses to 1 M sucrose in both LiqS and HS rats and to acesulfame K and salt tastants in LiqS rats after 40 days on diet. Umami, bitter, and acid response magnitudes were unchanged in both groups. These results demonstrate that chronic sucrose exposure inhibits taste responses to higher concentrations of sweet stimuli. More surprisingly, CT responses to NaCl and 0.5M NaAc were significantly reduced in rats on the LiqS diet. Thus, the physical form of the diet influences taste responsiveness to salt and sweet taste function. These data suggest that taste buds are previously unappreciated targets of chronic sucrose consumption.Copyright © 2019.

To this end, we simultaneously assessed how metal pollution and proximity to roads affect  condition and telomere shortening between days 8 and 15 of age in nestling great tits (Parus major), a common urban bird. We employed a repeated- sampling design to compare telomere shortening and  condition between nestlings from four urban study sites south of Antwerp, Belgium, which are located at different distances from a metal pollution point source. In addition, we explored associations between metal exposure and telomere dynamics on the individual level by measuring blood concentrations of five metals/metalloids, of which lead, copper and zinc were present at concentrations above the limit of detection. To assess whether roadway-associated stressors (e.g. noise and air pollution) might affect nestling condition and telomere shortening, we measured the proximity of nest boxes to roads. Metal exposure was not associated with nestling telomere length or  condition, despite elevated blood lead concentrations close to the metal pollution source (mean ± SE = 0.270 ± 0.095 μg/g wet  at the most polluted study site), suggesting that nestlings may have some capacity to detoxify metals. However, nestlings from nest boxes near roads exhibited more telomere shortening between days 8 and 15 of age, and shorter telomeres at day 15. Nestlings in poorer condition also had shorter telomeres, but proximity to the road was unrelated to  condition. Thus, nutritional stress is unlikely to mediate the relationship between proximity to roads and telomere length. Rather, proximity to roads could have affected telomere shortening by exposing nestlings to air or noise pollution. Our study highlights that traffic-related pollution, which is implicated in human health problems, might also affect urban wildlife.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Mean percentage  fat among infants (51.5% female) was 10.3 ± 3.7. Percentage  fat was significantly (p < 0.001) higher in infants born to women with an obese or overweight  mass index (BMI), when compared to infants born to women with a healthy BMI (12.1 ± 4.0, 11.1 ± 3.1, and 9.2 ± 3.7, respectively). A significant positive correlation (r = 0.294) was observed, with the percentage  fat of infants born to women with an overweight or obese BMI being 17.1% and 23.9% higher, respectively, than that of infants born to women with a healthy  BMI. Percentage  fat was lower in infants born to primiparous women (p = 0.011) and women of low social class (p = 0.003).Infants born to women with an overweight or obese pre-pregnancy BMI had significantly higher mean percentage  fat when compared to infants born to women with a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI.

The uterotrophic assay (UTA) utilizing 20 days old female mice and the reproductive cycle assay (RCA) utilizing adult female mice were used in this study. All administrations were performed orally. Reproductive organ and blood samples were collected the day after last administration of JF for histology and hormone analysis. Other parameters such as organ , temperature, , and reproductive cycles were analyzed. Our study showed that for UTA, JF increased uterine  slightly, which were nonsignificant but more pronounced at the highest dose of 1000 mg/kg. JF did not induce vaginal opening, which is a sign of puberty onset. JF also had minimal effect on organ morphology and caused a slight increase in serum estrogen. For RCA, JF did not significantly alter  and temperature although an upward trend in temperature was observed. JF did not disrupt cycling significantly ( > .005) compared with estrogen (the positive control drug used). JF also did not significantly alter uterus morphology except at 1000 mg/kg where some increase in the number of glands and cell activity were observed. JF has mild estrogenic activity and will not interfere with reproductive functions at lower doses (10-100 mg/kg) during therapy, but high doses (up to 1000 mg/kg and above) may cause some alterations. Our data, therefore, suggest that JF is a useful candidate in the management of female reproductive health issues at lower doses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671916>In Vitro and In Vivo Pipeline for Validation of Disease-Modifying Effects of Systems Biology-Derived Network Treatments for Traumatic Brain Injury-Lessons Learned.</a></h1><p>We developed a pipeline for the discovery of transcriptomics-derived disease-modifying therapies and used it to validate treatments in vitro and in vivo that could be repurposed for TBI treatment. Desmethylclomipramine, ionomycin, sirolimus and trimipramine, identified by in silico LINCS analysis as candidate treatments modulating the TBI-induced transcriptomics networks, were tested in neuron-BV2 microglial co-cultures, using tumour necrosis factor α as a monitoring biomarker for neuroinflammation, nitrite for nitric oxide-mediated neurotoxicity and microtubule associated protein 2-based immunostaining for neuronal survival. Based on (a) therapeutic time window in silico, (b) blood-brain barrier penetration and water solubility, (c) anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in vitro ( < 0.05) and (d) target engagement of Nrf2 target genes ( < 0.05), desmethylclomipramine was validated in a lateral fluid-percussion model of TBI in rats. Despite the favourable in silico and in vitro outcomes, in vivo assessment of clomipramine, which metabolizes to desmethylclomipramine, failed to demonstrate favourable effects on motor and memory tests. In fact, clomipramine treatment worsened the composite neuroscore ( < 0.05).  loss ( < 0.05) and prolonged upregulation of plasma cytokines ( < 0.05) may have contributed to the worsened somatomotor outcome.

More specifically, when certain samples in data sets encounter severe contamination, these methods cannot identify and filter out the ill ones, and thus lead to the functional degeneration of the associated models. To address this issue, we propose a general framework, named robust and sparse  learning (RSWL), to compute the adaptive  based on an objective for robustness and sparsity. More importantly, the degree of the sparsity is steerable, such that only k well-reserved samples are activated during the optimization of our model. As a result, the severely polluted or damaged samples are eliminated, and the robustness is ensured. The framework is further leveraged against a 2-D image reconstruction task. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670229>Thalidomide prevents antibody-mediated immune thrombocytopenia in mice.</a></h1><p>Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disorder characterized by immune-mediated platelet destruction, leading to lower platelet count. Thalidomide is considered as a novel immunomodulatory drug for treating several autoimmune diseases. Whether thalidomide can ameliorate ITP remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the effect of thalidomide on ITP mouse model. ITP mouse model was established through intraperitoneal injection of rat anti-mouse integrin GPIIb/CD41 immunoglobulin. Thalidomide (10, 20 or 50 mg/kg ) was intraperitoneally injected into mice followed by antibody injection. Then, peripheral blood and plasma was isolated for analysis of platelet count and the level of IFN-γ and IL-17 in plasma. Meanwhile, spleen was extracted to measure the expression of CD68, a macrophage marker. In addition, macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was cultured and treated with thalidomide followed by analysis of cell viability, apoptosis as well as cell cycle. Thalidomide prevented antiplatelet antibody-mediated platelet destruction in ITP mouse model. Compared with vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline), thalidomide significantly inhibited the secretion of IFN-γ and IL-17 in ITP mouse and reduced the expression of CD68 in spleen. After thalidomide treatment, the cell viability of RAW264.7 cell was significantly reduced and the cell number in S phase was also significantly decreased. In addition, the expression of cyclin E2 was significantly reduced. In conclusion, thalidomide prevents antiplatelet antibody-mediated platelet destruction in ITP mouse possibly through reducing the number of macrophages, suggesting that it might be a novel approach for treating ITP.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was aimed to determine whether adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSCs) might restore RI-induced SG dysfunction in a murine model. Forty -five mice were divided into three groups; a PBS sham group, a RI+ PBS sham group (0.01 mCi/g mouse, orally), and an RI+AdMSCs (1 × 10 cells/150 uL, intraglandular injection on experimental day 28) treated group. At 16 weeks after RI treatment,  , SG , salivary flow rates (SFRs), and salivary lag times were measured. Morphologic and histologic examinations and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed and the activities of amylase and EGF in saliva were also measured. Changes in salivary Tc pertechnetate excretion were followed by SPECT and TUNEL assays were performed. The  and SG  were similar in the AdMSCs and sham groups. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed the AdMSCs group had more mucin-containing acini than the RI group. Furthermore, AdMSCs treatment resulted in tissue remodeling and elevated expressions of epithelial (AQP5) and endothelial (CD31) markers, and increased SFRs. The activities of amylase and EGF were higher in the AdMSCs group than in the RI treated group. Tc pertechnetate excretions were similar in the AdMSCs and sham group. Also, TUNEL positive apoptotic cell numbers were less in the AdMSCs group than in the RI group. Local delivery of AdMSCs might regenerate SG damage induced by RI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670003>Injected laquinimod D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate polymeric micelles for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic relapsing disorders of the gastrointestinal tract characterized pathologically by intestinal inflammation and epithelial injury. Laquinimod (LAQ), a poorly water-soluble compound, was proved to be effective for colitis remission at low dose of 0.5 mg/kg in patients with Crohn's disease. Due to its extremely low solubility in water, it was difficult to develop an injectable liquid dosage form. Herein, D-α-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate (TPGS) polymeric micelles were developed as a delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease. Using the LAQ/TPGS ratio of 1:100, LAQ-loaded micelles were successfully prepared by thin-film dispersion method. The solubility of LAQ in water was significantly increased from 10.5 μg/mL in pure water to 500 μg/mL in TPGS micelles. LAQ-loaded micelles of TPGS exhibited the fine particle size of 34.6 nm and Zeta potential of -0.67 mV. Moreover, the good stability of LAQ-loaded micelles in physiology-mimicking medium was confirmed by detecting their particle size, zeta potential and leakage of the loading drug. Therapeutic effect of LAQ-loaded micelles on DSS-induced mice was proved by detecting DAI score, colon length and loss of . Moreover, the morphology and colonic mucosal barrier of the injured colon of DSS-induced mice was largely recovered after treatment with LAQ-loaded micelles. Meanwhile, the inflammation of colitis colon was also obviously alleviated by LAQ-loaded micelles. Conclusively, polymeric micelles of TPGS may be a promising delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To answer this question, we conducted a broad systematic search of non-surgical and non-pharmacological obesity treatment studies with the following strict criteria: (a) minimum 3-year follow-up, (b) 5%  mass lost, (c) no continued interventions in the follow-up-period, (d) prospective design, and (e) less than 30% attrition from the start of the follow-up period. While the search revealed a very large number of published articles, only eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Several of the nonincluded studies report a majority of participants achieving satisfactory  loss and little regain, especially among studies with continued interventions during the follow-up period. In contrast, the eight high-quality studies included in this study demonstrate a trend of  regain towards pretreatment baseline. This review concludes that the majority of high-quality follow-up treatment studies of individuals with obesity are not successful in maintaining  loss over time. The results suggest that excess  can be lost but is likely regained over time, for the majority of participants.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669802>The downstream effects of state tobacco control policies on maternal smoking during pregnancy and birth outcomes.</a></h1><p>Research has demonstrated that the implementation of tobacco control policies is associated with improved birth outcomes. Ascertainment of prenatal smoking on the US birth certificate has changed over the past decade to record smoking across each trimester.Using 2005-2015 birth certificate data on 26,436,541 singletons from 47 states and DC linked to state-level cigarette taxes and smoke-free legislation, we conducted conditional mixed-process models to examine the impact of tobacco control policies on prenatal smoking and quitting, then on the associated changes in birth outcomes. We included interactions between race/ethnicity, education, and taxes and present average marginal effects.Among white and black mothers with less than a high school degree, 36.0% and 14.1%, respectively, smoked during the first trimester and their babies had the poorest birth outcomes. However, they were the most responsive to cigarette taxes. Every $1.00 increase in taxes was associated with a 3.45 percentage point decrease in prenatal smoking among white mothers and a 1.20 percentage point decrease among black mothers. These reductions translated to increases in birth  by 4.19 g for babies born to white mothers and 0.89 g for babies born to black mothers. Among smokers, there was some evidence that taxes increased quitting and improved birth outcomes, although most associations were not statistically significant. We found limited effects of smoke-free legislation on smoking, quitting or birth outcomes.Cigarette taxes continue to have important downstream effects on reducing prenatal smoking and improving birth outcomes among the most vulnerable mothers and infants.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the production of P(3HB), urea and glucose feeding streams were developed to characterize the fed-batch culture conditions for new Cupriavidus necator NSDG-GG mutant. Feeding urea in repeated fed-batch stage (RFB-I) at 6, and 12 h in cultivation led to insignificant kinetic effect on the cell dry mass (CDM) and P(3HB) accumulation. Feeding glucose in repeated fed-batch stage (RFB-II) demonstrated that the incremental feeding approach of glucose after urea in fill-and-draw (F/D) mode at 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48 h in fermentation increased CDM and P(3HB) concentration. In the 1 cycle in RFB-II, the cumulative CDM reached the value of 26.22 g/L and then it increased with the successive repeated fed-batches to attain biomass of 145 g/L at the end of 5 cycle of RFB-II. The final cumulative P(3HB) concentration at the end of 5 cycle of RFB-II reached 111 g/L with the overall yield of 0.50 g P(3HB) g gluc; the CDM productivity from the RFB-II cycles was in the range of 0.84-1.3 g/(L·h). The RFB-II of glucose in an increment mode produced nearly 2.2 times more increase in CDM and P(3HB) productivities compared to the decrement RFB-II mode. Repeated cultivation had also the advantage of avoiding extra time required for innoculum preparation, and sterilization of bioreactor during batch, thereby it increased the overall industrial importance of the process.Copyright © 2019.

After 24-h treatment, pigs were monitored to assess feed intake (FI), and samples of serum and feces were collected to investigate serum profile, microbial composition, and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The results showed that HS decreased (P < 0.05) FI compared with the TN group. Compared with TN group, HS changed serum profile by affecting biochemical parameters and hormones related with energy metabolism and stress response; immune indicators were also altered in HS group. Most of changes in serum profile were independent of FI reduction. Additionally, HS shifted the diversity and composition of fecal microbial community by increasing (P < 0.05) Proteobacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) Bacteroidetes. Moreover, HS decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of propionate, butyrate, valerate, iso-valerate, and total SCFAs in feces with a FI-independent manner.

However, one consequence of massive  loss is excess skin and soft tissue. Many details regarding the timing, outcomes, and barriers associated with  contouring surgery (BCS) in youth who have undergone bariatric surgery are unknown.Describe the incidence and effect of BCS following bariatric surgery among adolescents.University Hospitals METHODS: Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery is a prospective multi-institutional study of 242 adolescents who underwent bariatric surgery from 2007 to 2012. Utilization of BCS was analyzed in this population with comparison of anthropometrics and excess skin-related symptoms between those who did and those who did not undergo BCS.Among the 198 study participants with BCS data available, 25 (12.6%) underwent 41  contouring procedures after bariatric surgery. The most common BCS was panniculectomy (n = 23). Presence of pannus-related symptoms at baseline and the magnitude of  loss within the first year after bariatric surgery were independently associated with subsequent panniculectomy (P = .04 and P = .03, respectively). All adolescents who underwent panniculectomy experienced resolution of pannus-related symptoms. At 5 years after bariatric surgery, 74% of those who did not undergo panniculectomy reported an interest in the procedure, and 58% indicated that cost/insurance coverage was the barrier to obtaining BCS.Few adolescents who underwent bariatric surgery later underwent BCS procedures. Panniculectomy effectively treated pannus-related symptoms.

Iron fortificants adversely affect the infant gut microbiota, while co-provision of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) mitigates most of the adverse effects. Whether variations in maternal HMO profile can influence the infant response to iron and/or GOS fortificants is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine HMO profiles and the secretor/non-secretor phenotype of lactating Kenyan mothers and investigate their effects on the maternal and infant gut microbiota, and on the infant response to a fortification intervention with 5 mg iron (2.5 mg as sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate and 2.5 mg as ferrous fumarate) and 7.5 g GOS. We studied mother-infant pairs ( = 80) participating in a 4-month intervention trial in which the infants (aged 6.5-9.5 months) received daily a micronutrient powder without iron, with iron or with iron and GOS. We assessed: (1) maternal secretor status and HMO composition; (2) effects of secretor status on the maternal and infant gut microbiota in a cross-sectional analysis at baseline of the intervention trial; and (3) interactions between secretor status and intervention groups during the intervention trial on the infant gut microbiota, gut inflammation, iron status, growth and infectious morbidity. Secretor prevalence was 72% and HMOs differed between secretors and non-secretors and over time of lactation. Secretor status did not predict the baseline composition of the maternal and infant gut microbiota. There was a secretor-status-by-intervention-group interaction on  ( = 0.021), Z-scores for length-for-age ( = 0.022) and -for-age ( = 0.018), and soluble transferrin receptor ( = 0.041). In the no iron group, longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea was higher among infants of non-secretors (23.8%) than of secretors (10.4%) ( = 0.001). In conclusion, HMO profile may modulate the infant gut microbiota response to fortificant iron; compared to infants of secretor mothers, infants of non-secretor mothers may be more vulnerable to the adverse effect of iron but also benefit more from the co-provision of GOS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671025>Social work and toddler overweight risk: Identifying modifiable child and parent factors across the socioeconomic gradient.</a></h1><p>: Childhood obesity is associated with long-term health consequences, yet little is known about the prevalence of child and parent risk factors of overweight across the socioeconomic gradient in early life. This exploratory study documents the prevalence of risk factors that contribute to overweight among toddlers within and across socioeconomic status (SES). : Obesity risk factors were examined within and across SES quintiles in a nationally representative sample. Data were collected from 5,100 mothers and 2-year-old children. Weighted regression models assessed child and parent characteristics that predict toddler  status in a national sample and samples stratified by SES quintiles. : Higher rates of overweight were observed in Q1 (29.2%) and reduced with each successive SES quintile (16.9%-Q5), suggesting a gradient effect. Results indicated factors unique within quintiles, distinct from the full national sample: Q1-motor development; Q2-motor and mental development, maternal BMI, breastfeeding, bottle feeding, introduction of solid foods; Q3-breastfeeding; and Q4-5-introduction of solid foods. : Findings further existing knowledge of toddler obesity by uncovering risks relevant for specific SES groups.

The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy of 2D US and 3D US with two different methods of projection for the identification of fetal macrosomia at term.Prospective study which included women at risk for fetal macrosomia referred for fetal biometry between 34-36 weeks. The estimated fetal  (EFW) was computed using 2D US and the Hadlock Model IV or through 3D US and the Model VI by Lee et al. The projection of the EFW at the time of delivery was performed by using Yudkin's chart percentiles and the gestation-adjusted projection (GAP) method.Overall, 230 patients were included. Paired comparison between 2D-US-EFW and 3D-US-EFW with either method of projection of the EFW at birth suggested different properties of the techniques, being 2D-US-EFW associated with higher sensitivity and 3D-US-EFW with higher specificity, PPV and LR + . At ROC curve no difference was found in the prediction of birthweight ≥90th centile using 2D-US-EFW or 3D-US-EFW (AUC 0.831, 95%CI 0.768-0.894 versus AUC 0.860, 95%CI 0.799-0.920, respectively, p 0.37) nor in the prediction of birthweight >95th centile with 2D-US-EFW compared to 3D-US-EFW (0.803, 95%CI 0.731-0.874 versus 0.866, 95%CI 0.805-0.926, respectively, p 0.07). Similarly, a non-significant difference in the accuracy of the prediction of birthweight >4000 g (AUC 0.788, 95%CI 0.716-0.859 for 2D-US-EFW vs AUC 0.802, 95%CI 0.723-0.880 for 3D-US-EFW, p 0.72) and >4500 g (0.828, 95%CI 0.720-0.936 for 2D-US-EFW vs 0.858, 95%CI 0.759-0.956 for 3D-US-EFW, p 0.71) with the GAP method could be demonstrated.Within a population at risk of fetal macrosomia the performance of 3D-US-EFW is similar to that of 2D-US-EFW in the prediction of macrosomia at term regardless of the method used for the projection of the EFW, however different properties were noted between the two techniques. Such finding suggests a potential complementary role of the techniques which warrants evaluation in future research.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Among 976 identified publications, 20 randomized clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. The initial search was extended to include five studies published between July 2016 and September 2018.Maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, cesarean section, maternal parathyroid hormone and calcium concentrations, and infant gestational age, birth , and birth length.Mean differences, odds ratios, and 95% CIs were calculated, only for the initial search, using separate random-effects meta-analyses for each outcome.Evidence was good or strong that maternal vitamin D supplementation significantly increased maternal (13 studies, n=18, mean difference, 14.1 ng/mL [35.2 nmol/L]; 95% CI=9.6-18.6 ng/mL [24.0-46.4 nmol/L]) and infant (nine studies, n=12; 9.7, 5.2, 14.2 ng/mL [24.2, 12.9, 35.5 nmol/L]) 25(OH)D concentrations, although heterogeneity was significant (I=95.9% and I=97.4, respectively, P<0.001). Evidence was fair that vitamin D supplementation significantly decreases maternal homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (five studies, n=7; -1.1, -1.5, -0.7) and increases infant birth  (nine studies, n=11, 114.2, 63.4, 165.1 g), both had insignificant heterogeneity. A null effect of maternal supplementation on other maternal (preeclampsia, cesarean section) and infant (gestational age, birth length) outcomes was found.Results show vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy improves maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations and may play a role in maternal insulin resistance and fetal growth. To further inform practice and policies on the amount of vitamin D, which supports a healthy pregnancy, high quality dose-response randomized clinical trials, which assess pregnancy-specific 25(OH)D thresholds, and appropriately powered clinical outcomes are needed.Copyright © 2019 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

School gym classes met alternate school days. Site 1 had standard gym classes (CON). Site 2 gym classes included 8-12 minutes of resistance training (INT); INT girls were categorized based on observed participation effort and time (LO, HI). Measurements included: 1) height and ; 2) questionnaires to assess extracurricular exercise and diet (calcium, vitamin D); 3) dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Lunar Prodigy). Whole  less head (SUB) scans yielded bone mineral content (BMC) and  composition. Lumbar spine (L1-L4) and femoral neck (FN) scans yielded BMC and areal bone mineral density (BMD); radius scans yielded ultradistal and 1/3 BMD. ANCOVA compared group means for percent gains from BL to FU2, accounting for biological maturity, BL height, height change, inter-scan interval, organized activity, calcium and vitamin D.In 62 girls (21 CON, 41 INT), intention to treat analyses detected INT vs. CON advantages for L1-L4 BMC and BMD (4.1%, 5.6%: p<0.05). HI effort participants (n=19) demonstrated advantages for BMC and BMD at L1-L4 and FN (5.7% to 8.2%, p<0.01) vs. CON.Over two school years, this resistance intervention yielded lumbar spine advantages; enthusiastic participation (HI) yielded lumbar spine and femoral neck advantages.

Demographic characteristics and preoperative risk factors were collected. Postoperative outcomes included %TWL, percent excess  loss, and complications rates and causes. Subset analysis was done for outcomes comparison between surgeons or gastroenterologists performing the procedure. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 25.0.A total of 1221 patients were included. The majority was female (81.9%), Caucasian (81.2%), with a mean age of 48 ± 11.3 years and a mean preoperative  mass index of 34.9 ± 11.2 kg/m. Of patients, 98.8% were discharged within 24 hours of the procedure. Two patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 7.2% received postoperative treatment for dehydration. Reoperation and readmission rates were 1.1% and 7.2%, respectively, mainly due to nausea, vomiting, and poor nutritional status (n = 22). The intervention rate was 6.2%.

Study investigators and outcomes assessors were blinded to participant groups. Data were collected and analyzed from May 23, 2016, through November 13, 2017, based on intention to treat.All participants were advised to weigh themselves daily, with a goal of 6 or more days per week, and received text messaging feedback on their performance. Incentive group participants were eligible for a lottery-based incentive worth an expected value of $3.98 in week 1 that escalated by $0.43 each week they achieved their self-weighing goal during months 1 to 6 (phase 1), followed by no incentives during months 7 to 12 (phase 2).The primary outcome was  change at the end of phase 1. Secondary outcomes included  change at the end of phase 2 and changes in self-reported physical activity and eating behaviors.A total of 258 participants (128 in the incentive group and 130 in the control group) had a mean (SD) age of 48.0 (10.5) years and mean (SD)  mass index of 32.1 (3.9); 225 (87.2%) were women; 235 (91.1%) were white; and 102 (39.5%) had an annual income of at least $100 000.  measurement was transmitted by 250 participants (96.9%) at 6 months and 227 (88.0%) at 12 months. The percentage of weeks that incentive and control participants achieved a mean self-weighing of at least 6 times was 85.3% vs 75.8%, respectively (P = .002) in phase 1 and 37.7% vs 50.2%, respectively (P = .009) in phase 2. Mean  changes at the end of phase 1 were -1.1 (95% CI, -2.1 to -0.1) kg in the incentive group and -1.9 (95% CI, -2.9 to -0.8) kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.7 (95% CI, -0.7 to 2.2) kg (P = .30 for comparison). At the end of phase 2, mean  changes were 0.2 (95% CI, -1.2 to 1.7) kg in the incentive group and -0.6 (95% CI, -2.0 to 0.8) kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.8 (95% CI, -1.2 to 2.8) kg (P = .41 for comparison).Compared with an active control condition of weekly messages, escalating lottery-based incentives transiently increased rates of self-weighing but did not significantly enhance  loss maintenance.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671540>Outlier Detection Using Improved Support Vector Data Description in Wireless Sensor Networks.</a></h1><p>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are susceptible to faults in sensor data. Outlier detection is crucial for ensuring the quality of data analysis in WSNs. This paper proposes a novel improved support vector data description method (ID-SVDD) to effectively detect outliers of sensor data. ID-SVDD utilizes the density distribution of data to compensate SVDD. The Parzen-window algorithm is applied to calculate the relative density for each data point in a data set. Meanwhile, we use Mahalanobis distance (MD) to improve the Gaussian function in Parzen-window density estimation. Through combining new relative density  with SVDD, this approach can efficiently map the data points from sparse space to high-density space. In order to assess the outlier detection performance, the ID-SVDD algorithm was implemented on several datasets. The experimental results demonstrated that ID-SVDD achieved high performance, and could be applied in real water quality monitoring.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670674>Active arrangement of small objects in 3D indoor scenes.</a></h1><p>Small object arrangement is very important for creating detailed and realistic 3D indoor scenes. In this paper, we present an interactive framework based on active learning to help users create customized arrangements for small objects according to their preferences. To achieve this with minimal user effort, we first learn the prior knowledge about small object arrangement from a 3D indoor scene dataset through a probability mining method, which forms the initial guidance for arranging small objects. Then, users are able to express their preferences on a few small object categories, which are automatically propagated to all the other categories via a novel active learning approach.In the propagation process, we introduce a novel metric to obtain the propagation , which  the degree of interchangeability between two small object categories, and is calculated based on a spatial embedding model learned from the small object neighborhood information extracted from the 3D indoor scene dataset. Experiments show that our framework is able to help users effectively create customized small object arrangements with little effort.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671595>The Mediator and/or Moderator Role of Complexity of Knowledge about Healthy Eating and Self-Regulated Behavior on the Relation between Family's Income and Children's Obesity.</a></h1><p>Childhood obesity rates have been increasing over the years and is considered one of the most serious public health problems of the century. Low socioeconomic status has been associated with a higher  mass index. However, the pathways underlying this complex relationship are poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the possible mediation and/or moderation effects of complexity of knowledge about healthy eating, and self-regulation processes towards healthy eating, in the association between family's income and  of elementary school age children. The results showed that complexity of knowledge does not mediate the relationship between socioeconomic status and . Still, whenever the levels of complexity of knowledge and self-regulation are high, there is a moderation effect of complexity of knowledge on the relationship between family's income and , conditioned by self-regulation scores. These promising findings support the idea that knowledge about healthy eating in isolation could be insufficient for practicing a healthy diet and underline the relevance of combining transmission of knowledge with training in specific competences (e.g., self-regulation strategies). Considering that complexity of knowledge about healthy eating and self-regulation strategies are interrelated and can be both improved, future preventive interventions could consider incorporating both in their design to mitigate childhood obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675095>Impact of Imidacloprid Soil Drenching on Survival, Longevity, and Reproduction of the Zoophytophagous Predator Podisus maculiventris (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae: Asopinae).</a></h1><p>Systemic insecticides when applied as seed treatments or soil drenches are often more toxicologically selective for natural enemies than target pests. This may not be the case, however, for omnivorous predators, which are at risk of extended exposure to systemically applied pesticides through ingestion while feeding on treated plants for nutrients or water. Such exposure may kill or have sublethal consequences for these natural enemies, compromising their role as biocontrol agents of agricultural pest species. The spined soldier bug, Podisus maculiventris (Say) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae: Asopinae), is an important zoophytophagous biocontrol agent (i.e., able to substitute zoophagy by phytophagy for survival) that may be exposed to systemic insecticides in many agricultural systems. We, therefore, examined effects on P. maculiventris following exposure to cabbage plants subject to soil-drench treatments with imidacloprid, a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide. Predator survival, development, , and reproduction were recorded. Imidacloprid significantly affected nymph survival and adult emergence, but not duration of the nymphal period or adult . At one-twentieth the recommended field rate for whitefly and aphid management, imidacloprid treatments reduced longevity, fecundity, and fertility of female predators. These findings demonstrate that soil treatments with systemic insecticide can negatively impact zoophytophagous natural enemies.© The Author(s) 2019.

Clinical studies have isolated fat within bone and muscle using MRI. In this cross-sectional study, we hypothesized that bone marrow adiposity and muscle adiposity are related, and that this relationship is associated with osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women 60-85 years of age were recruited as part of the Appendicular Muscle and Bone Extension Research Study (AMBERS). Participants completed DXA of the hip and spine to diagnose osteoporosis. Muscle adiposity was measured with MRI at the 66% site of the leg. Fat segmentation was achieved using a semi-automated iterative threshold-optimizing algorithm (error<5%). Peripheral quantitative computed tomography measured marrow density of the 4% distal tibia (surrogate for marrow fat) by threshold-based, edge-detection segmentations and by examining residuals from trabecular bone density regressed on trabecular tissue mineral density. Muscle adiposity from MRI was regressed on marrow density using linear regression. Models were further examined with an interaction with osteoporosis status. Among 312 women (age: 75.4±5.9yrs, BMI: 29.5±5.7kg/m ), a larger amount of muscle fat was associated with lower marrow density at the 66% mid-tibia (B: 84.08(27.56), p=0.002) and at the 4% distal tibia (B: 129.17(55.96), p=0.022) after accounting for age, height, , average daily energy expenditure, hypertension and diabetes. Interactions of this relationship with osteoporosis status were also significant. Upon probing these interactions, the relationships were significant only in women with osteoporosis, but not in those without osteoporosis. Fat from bone marrow and muscle may be related to one another through the same phenomenon, which is likely also responsible for osteoporosis, but independent of hypertension and diabetes. More research should focus on the potential abnormalities in muscle and bone fat metabolism and mesenchymal cell commitment to fat within patients with osteoporosis.

In this multicenter study, the clinical presentation and genetic background of Chinese children with Dent disease are studied to improve the cognition and diagnostic ability of pediatricians. In this prospective cohort, we described the genotype and phenotype of a national cohort composed of 45 pediatric probands with Dent disease belonging to 45 families from 12 different regions of China recruited from 2014 to 2018 by building up the multicenter registration system. The CLCN5 gene from 32 affected families revealed 28 different mutations. The OCRL gene from 13 affected families revealed 13 different mutations. The incidence of low-molecular- proteinuria (LMWP) in both Dent disease type 1 populations and Dent disease type 2 populations was 100.0%; however, the incidence of other manifestations was not high, which was similar to previously reported data. Therefore, LMWP is a key clinical feature that should alert clinicians to the possibility of Dent disease. A high amount of LMWP combined with positive gene test results can be used as the diagnostic criteria for this disease. The diagnostic criteria are helpful in reducing the missed diagnosis of this disease and are beneficial for protecting the renal function of these patients through early diagnosis and early intervention.

We aimed to evaluate the protective role of taurine (TAU), a beta amino acid with antioxidant activity, against DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity in a rat model. Thirty-one male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-400 g) were randomized into four groups: control (n = 7, intraperitoneal [ip] saline for 14 days), TAU (n = 8, 150 mg/kg  TAU ip for 14 days), DOXO (n = 8, 25 mg/kg  DOXO ip on 12th, 13th, and 14th days), and DOXO + TAU (n = 8, TAU for 14 days and DOXO on 12th, 13th, and 14th days). The left ventricular functions were evaluated on 15th day by echocardiography. The heart tissues were then excised for histological evaluation. In DOXO group, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), fractional shortening (FS), and mitral lateral annulus (s') velocity were significantly lower, and the left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters (LVEDD, LVESD) were significantly higher than control group (p < 0.05), indicating a significant deterioration in left ventricular functions. However, in comparison to DOXO group, LVESD, LVEDD, LVEF, FS, and s' were significantly improved in DOXO + TAU group (p < 0.05). On histological evaluation, contrary to the normal cellular structure of cardiomyocytes in control and TAU groups, DOXO group showed increased nuclear or cytoplasmic changes and infiltrative cell proliferation (p < 0.001), which were remarkably reduced in DOXO + TAU group (p < 0.001). TAU treatment has a protective effect against DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity on echocardiographical and histological evaluation. For common use of TAU to prevent DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity, our findings should be confirmed by clinical studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671422>In Search of Imprints Left by the Impairment of Nephrogenesis.</a></h1><p>Clinical aspects dealing with the impairment of nephrogenesis in preterm and low birth  babies were intensely researched. In this context it was shown that quite different noxae can harm nephron formation, and that the morphological damage in the fetal kidney is rather complex. Some pathological findings show that the impairment leads to changes in developing glomeruli that are restricted to the maturation zone of the outer cortex in the fetal human kidney. Other data show also imprints on the stages of nephron anlage including the niche, the pretubular aggregate, the renal vesicle, and comma- and S-shaped bodies located in the overlying nephrogenic zone of the rodent and human kidneys. During our investigations it was noticed that the stages of nephron anlage in the fetal human kidney during the phase of late gestation have not been described in detail. To contribute, these stages were recorded along with corresponding images. The initial nephron formation in the rodent kidney served as a reference. Finally, the known imprints left by the impairment in both specimens were listed and discussed. In sum, the relatively paucity of data on nephron formation in the fetal human kidney during the late phase of gestation is a call to start with intense research so that concepts for a therapeutic prolongation of nephrogenesis can be designed.© 2019 S.

Here we tested the hypothesis that maternal exercise before and during pregnancy would positively affect glucose homeostasis, pancreatic cell function, and gut microbiota dysbiosis in high-fat diet (HFD) fed dams. Female C57BL/6 mice were fed either a HFD or a low-fat diet (LFD) for 12 weeks. The HFD mice were split into two groups for 4 weeks prior to pregnancy initiation and throughout the pregnancy: sedentary (HFD) or exercised (HFD + Ex). Food intake, ,  composition, and glucose and insulin tolerance were measured. At gestation day 19, blood, pancreas, gonadal visceral and subcutaneous fat, plantaris muscle, and cecum were collected for analysis. Both HFD and HFD + Ex mice had impaired glucose clearance compared to LFD mice at 15 days of gestation. No changes were found in pancreatic α- or β-cell health. HFD + Ex mice had significantly reduced visceral fat mass, serum insulin, and leptin levels and increased high-density lipoprotein levels, compared to HFD-fed mice. In contrast to our hypothesis, microbiota diversity and composition were not different among groups. The relative abundance of five bacterial phyla, such as Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Deferribacteres, and Actinobacteria, were not significantly altered with diet or exercise during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that maternal exercise prevents excess visceral fat accumulation, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia associated with a HFD, but not through the alterations of gut microbiota composition or diversity during pregnancy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

(BO) can suppress lipid accumulation in 3 T3-L1 adipocytes. Similarly, we recently revealed that Erigeron annuus L. Pers (EA) can significantly diminish both lipid accumulation and adipocyte differentiation in 3 T3-L1 cells through an AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase)-dependent mechanism. Accordingly, the objective of this present study was to evaluate the anti-obesity activity of EA and/or BO using an animal model of obesity. Obesity was induced in C57BL/6 J mice by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD; 60 kcal% fat) for 3 weeks, followed by administration of EA and/or BO (100-200 mg/kg ) or positive control Garcinia Cambogia (GC) (100 mg/kg ) for an additional 8 weeks. The anti-obesity effect of EA and/or BO was assessed by measuring , adipocyte size, lipid accumulation, and expression level of genes associated with adipogenesis. We found the administration of EA and/or BO significantly attenuated increases in  gain, adipocyte size, and lipid accumulation in obese mice induced by HFD. In addition, western blot analysis revealed that HFD-mediated increases in expressions levels of adipogenic genes such as PPARγ, C/EBPα, and SREBP-1c were diminished by EA and/or BO. Moreover, EA and/or BO significantly stimulated the production of adiponectin, a unique adipokine known to stimulate the breakdown of fat/lipids, whereas adiponectin levels were reduced in mice fed a HFD. Notably, a combination of EA and BO was more effective at modulating such parameters than EA or BO alone. Taken together, these results demonstrate that an anti-obesity effect of EA and/or BO can reduce adipocyte hypertrophy and modulate the expression of adipogenesis-associated genes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized that MetS confers an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in severely injured trauma patients.We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients from 2014 through 2018, excluding patients <16 years of age, ISS <16, and with incomplete height and/or  documentation. MetS was defined as the presence of diabetes, hypertension, and a BMI ≥30 kg/m. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), complications, discharge location, and mortality.There were 4,491 patients meeting criteria of which 100 (2.2%) had MetS. Patients with MetS were older (64.0 vs 38.6 years, p<.0001) but similar in ISS (22 vs 22, p=.70). Hospital LOS was significantly longer with MetS (16.5 vs 11 days, p <.0001) as was ICU LOS (9 vs 5 days, p=.0002). MetS correlated with higher rates of AKI (19% vs 3.6%,p<.0001), ARDS (11.0% vs 4.6%, p=.01), cardiac arrest (10.0% vs 4.0%, p=.01), MI (2.0% vs 0.3%, p=.05), severe sepsis (8.0% vs 3.3%, p=.03), unplanned intubation (11.0% vs 5.0%, p=.02), unplanned ICU admission (13.0% vs 6.1%, p=.02), and non-home discharge (51.0% vs 30.2%, p=.0007). After controlling for age, GCS, ISS, gender, and mechanism, MetS remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.33-4.7, p=.004).MetS occurs infrequently in our severely injured trauma population but is strongly associated with increasing LOS as well as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, and renal complications. MetS also significantly and independently predicts death and should be identified early to facilitate prompt multidisciplinary treatment.Copyright © 2019.

Escherichia coli has been the most popular bacterial host for the heterologous production of a variety of carotenoids, including even xanthophylls unique to photosynthetic eukaryotes such as lutein, antheraxanthin, and violaxanthin. However, conversion efficiency of these epoxy-xanthophylls (antheraxanthin and violaxanthin) from zeaxanthin remained substantially low. We here examined several factors affecting their productivity in E. coli. Two sorts of plasmids were introduced into the bacterial host, i.e., a plasmid to produce zeaxanthin due to the presence of the Pantoea ananatis crtE, crtB, crtI, crtY, and crtZ genes in addition to the Haematococcus pluvialis IDI gene, and one containing each of zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP) genes originated from nine photosynthetic eukaryotes. It was consequently found that paprika (Capsicum annuum) ZEP (CaZEP) showed the highest conversion activity. Next, using the CaZEP gene, we performed optimization experiments in relation to E. coli strains as the production hosts, expression vectors, and ribosome-binding site (RBS) sequences. As a result, the highest productivity of violaxanthin (231 μg/g dry ) was observed, when the pUC18 vector was used with CaZEP preceded by a RBS sequence of score 5000 in strain JM101(DE3).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675335>Use of pelvic corrective force with visual feedback improves paretic leg muscle activities and gait performance after stroke.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of combined pelvic corrective force and visual feedback during treadmill walking on paretic leg muscle activity and gait characteristics in individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis. Fifteen chronic stroke participants completed visual feedback only and combined pelvic corrective force and visual feedback conditions during treadmill walking. Each condition included: 1-minute baseline, 7-minute training with visual feedback only or additional pelvic corrective force, 1-minute post training, 1-minute standing break, and another 5-minute training. EMGs from the paretic leg muscles and step length were measured. Overground walking was evaluated before treadmill walking, immediately and 10 minutes after treadmill walking. Greater increases in integrated EMG of all muscles, except vastus medialis and tibialis anterior, were observed with the application of additional pelvic corrective force compared to visual feedback only during treadmill walking. Overground walking speed significantly increased after treadmill training with combined pelvic correction force and visual feedback, but was not significant for the visual feedback only condition. Voluntary  shifting with additional pelvic corrective force enhanced paretic leg muscle activities and improved gait characteristics during walking. Individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis could adapt feedforward control and generalize the adaptation to overground walking.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669136>No evidence of tachyphylaxis for insulinotropic actions of Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide (GIP) in subjects with type 2 diabetes, their first-degree relatives, or in healthy subjects.</a></h1><p>In patients with type 2 diabetes, the lost insulinotropic effect of the incretin hormone glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is more apparent after continuous versus bolus administration. To test whether the difference might be explained by rapid tachyphylaxis in response to elevated concentrations of GIP, and whether patients with type 2 diabetes and their relatives are more susceptible to tachyphylaxis than healthy subjects.In a two-way crossover design, insulinotropic responses to repeated bolus injection (50 pmol/kg  at 30 and 120 min) and continuous infusion of GIP (2 pmol.kg-1.min-1 from 30-180 min) under hyperglycaemic clamp conditions (8.5 mmol/l) was compared in age- gender- and -matched patients with type 2 diabetes, first degree relatives of such patients, and healthy subjects.Insulin secretory responses to the first and second GIP bolus were not significantly different in any of the subject groups. Subjects with type 2 diabetes had a significant relative impairment versus healthy subjects with continuous (C-peptide, -13.2 %, p < 0.05), but not with repeated bolus administration of GIP (+11.1 %, n.s.). First-degree relatives tended to hyper-secrete insulin with bolus or continuous administrations of GIP.Rapid tachyphylaxis in response to continuous exposure to slightly supraphysiological concentrations of GIP does not explain the reduced insulinotropic response to GIP infusions in patients with type 2 diabetes or their first-degree relatives.Copyright © 2019.

We hypothesized that low dietary Mg intake may alter sPTH response to s25OHD in a population with excess , thereby leading to a worsening of cardiometabolic health. To explore this hypothesis, we conducted a cross-sectional study on adults who were either overweight or obese (owt/ob). Dietary Mg intake was measured using a Mg food frequency questionnaire (MgFFQ).  composition information was measured using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). Blood samples were obtained for all biochemical analyses. A total of 57 participants, 22 to 65 years of age, with a  mass index between 25 to 45 kg/m were divided into 3 groups, according to dietary Mg intake percentiles (Low Mg Group = <33 percentile, Medium Mg Group = 33 to 66 percentile, High Mg Group = >66 percentile). Higher s25OHD was negatively associated with lower sPTH in the High Mg Intake group (r = -0.472, P = .041), but not in other groups. A positive relationship between s25OHD and serum high-molecular  adiponectin concentrations was observed in the High Mg Group (r = 0.532, r = 0.022), but not in other groups. Serum Interleukin-6 concentrations were negatively associated with s25OHD (r = -0.316, P = .017) for the entire study group. Based on these results, our study demonstrated that a low dietary Mg intake may alter PTH response to 25OHD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Thirty-two male lambs, with an average  of 20.8 ± 2.9 kg, were fed with different levels of spineless cactus in replacement for 0, 33, 66 or 100% of maniçoba hay (i.e. 0, 200, 400, 600 g kg of dietary DM). The replacement maniçoba hay by spineless cactus did not influence dry matter intake (g d) and cold carcass  (P > .05), but increased (P < .05) the carcass finishing fat but did not influence (P < .05) the physical characteristics of the lambs' meat. Lower values for odor, flavor and purchase intention of meat were observed with 66% of replacement. Therefore, replacement of 33% maniçoba hay by spineless cactus can be recommended as optimal level, because it improve the fattening of the carcass, without causing negative effects on performance or meat quality.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to determine the frequency of ARFID symptoms and study its characteristics and associated gastrointestinal symptoms.We conducted a retrospective review of charts from 410 consecutive referrals (ages 18-90 y; 73.0% female) to a tertiary care center for neurogastroenterology examination, from January through December 2016. Blinded coders (n=4) applied DSM-5 criteria for ARFID, with substantial diagnostic agreement (κ=.66).Twenty-six cases (6.3%) met the full criteria for ARFID and 71 cases (17.3%) had clinically significant avoidant or restrictive eating behaviors with insufficient information for a definitive diagnosis of ARFID. Of patients with ARFID symptoms (n=97), 90 patients (92.8%) cited fear of gastrointestinal symptoms as motivation for their avoidant or restrictive eating. A series of binary logistic regressions showed that likelihood of having ARFID symptoms increased significantly in patients with eating- or -related complaints (odds ratio [OR], 5.09; 95% CI, 2.54-10.21); with dyspepsia, nausea, or vomiting (OR, 3.59; 95% CI, 2.04-6.32); with abdominal pain (OR, 4.72; 95% CI, 1.87-11.81); or with more than 1 diagnosis of a gastrointestinal disorder (OR=1.63, 95% CI, 1.26-2.10).In a retrospective study of patients undergoing neurogastroenterology examinations, we found ARFID symptoms to be most frequently related to fear of gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients undergoing neurogastroenterology or motility examinations should be evaluated for symptoms of ARFID, particularly when providers consider dietary interventions.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Unfortunately, they usually rely on 3D volumes or fiber meshes that are not only data-intensive but also expensive to render. Traditional surface-based models, on the other hand, are light- and fast to render but normally lack the fidelity and details important for design and prototyping applications. We introduce a multi-scale, hybrid model to bridge this gap for thin fabrics. Our model enjoys both the compactness and speedy rendering offered by traditional surface-based models and the rich details provided by the micro-appearance models. Further, we propose a new algorithm to convert state-of-the-art micro-appearance models into our representation while qualitatively preserving the detailed appearance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by integrating it into a real-time rendering system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669268>Thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip) forms redox sensitive high molecular  nucleoprotein complexes.</a></h1><p>Thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip) is an α-arrestin protein that regulates pleiotropic biological responses. Txnip acts as a cancer suppressor and is a critical regulator of energy metabolism. To investigate molecular mechanisms involving Txnip, we searched for its protein binding partners using tandem affinity purification and proteomics analyses and identified several viable candidates, including HSP90, HSP70, and Prp31. We showed, by native PAGE, that Txnip is involved in the formation of high molecular  complexes (1000-1300 kDa) in the nuclear fraction of cells treated with glucose and bortezomib. DTT treatment partly dissolved these high molecular  complexes, suggesting that Txnip forms redox sensitive high-order nucleoprotein complexes. RNAse treatment slightly decreased the complex and RNA-seq showed differential expression of RNAs in the complex between Txnip protein overexpressing and control cells, indicating the involvement of RNAs in the complex. These results collectively provide a model whereby Txnip exerts its functions through multiple binding partners, forming transient higher-order complexes to regulate other signaling molecules.Copyright © 2019.

Participants identified 7 goals; one of which was pre-defined as adhering to diet. Over the beginning 14 days of their diet, participants completed an Ecological Momentary Assessment study recording their food intake in real-time. Every evening, participants reported their goal engagement and which goals conflicted or facilitated with each other. Over the study duration, 1452 days of food intake and goal conflict/facilitation were recorded. Participants completed an average of 1.54 ( = 0.85) snacks, an average of 0.94 ( = 1.81) goal conflicts, and 4.16 ( = 4.70) goal facilitations per day. Inter-goal conflict was associated with a significant but small improvement on individuals' mood, but was not associated with daily dietary intake or long-term -loss. Similarly, inter-goal facilitation was not associated with daily dietary intake or long-term -loss. Daily food intake was a significant predictor of long-term -loss. The results of this study suggest the impact of inter-goal conflict and facilitation on dieting is not via overall snack or food consumption.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673966>Genome-wide association studies for growth traits in buffaloes using the single step genomic BLUP.</a></h1><p>Growth traits are important for the profitability of buffalo breeding systems, since in general, these animals are raised both for meat and milk. In this study, the single-step genomic BLUP method was employed to prospect the genomic regions' associated with  at standard ages of 100, 210, 365, and 550 days in a buffalo population, aiming to identify genes with stronger expression for those characteristics. We found 6, 1, 2, and 5 SNPs significantly associated (p value < 10) with  at 100, 210, 365, and 550 days of age, respectively, where those SNPs respectively explained 0.164, 0.040, 0.044, and 0.213% of the additive variance of each trait.

This study was conducted to evaluate the combined effect of hill density and nitrogen (N) fertilizer rate on yield attributes in hybrid rice under low-light conditions. Field experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015. Two hybrid rice cultivars (Y-liangyou 1 and Luoyou 9348) were grown under combinations of three hill density levels (high, 40 × 10 hills ha; moderate, 27 × 10 hills ha; low, 14 × 10 hills ha) and two N rate levels (high, 240 kg ha; moderate, 143-148 kg ha), and shaded from heading to maturity. Grain yield was highest in the combination of high hill density and moderate N rate and significantly declined with decreasing hill density combined with increasing N rate for both cultivars in both years. Averaged across two cultivars and two years, grain yield declined by about 4% for each 10% decrease in hill density combined with each 10% increase in N rate. A significant reduction in spikelet filling percentage was observed with decreasing hill density combined with increasing N rate in Y-liangyou 1 in 2015 and Luoyou 9348 in 2014. The same trend was observed for grain  in Y-liangyou 1 in 2014 and Luoyou 9348 in 2015. These results indicate that adopting the practice of decreasing hill density combined with increasing N rate can result in poor grain filling and consequently yield decline in hybrid rice under low-light conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670260>Examining emotion-, personality-, and reward-related dispositional tendencies in relation to eating pathology and  change over seven years in the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) study.</a></h1><p>This study examined dispositional emotion-, personality/temperament-, and reward-related variables in relation to post-surgery eating pathology and -change among 107 adults who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). As part of a prospective cohort study, annual post-surgical assessments were conducted to evaluate eating pathology, using the Eating Disorder Examination-Bariatric Surgery Version, and percent  change from pre-surgery. Dispositional  were administered at the 6- or 7-year assessment and included the Affect Intensity Measure, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale, Adult Temperament Questionnaire-Effortful Control Scale, and Sensitivity to Punishment/Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire. Results from a series of linear mixed models revealed significant associations of emotion dysregulation, affect intensity, positive and negative urgency, effortful control, and reward sensitivity with eating pathology severity across 7 years; additionally, all but two of the subscales comprising the total scores were also significantly associated. Fewer statistically significant results were found in relation to  change; emotion dysregulation and affect intensity (along with several subscales) were significantly associated with lower percent  change (i.e., less  loss), but of the reward-related and personality/temperament variables, only total effortful control emerged as significant. However, the associations of the other variables with both outcomes were consistently in the expected direction. Associations also appeared consistent across surgical procedures. Taken together, findings suggest that certain dispositional tendencies may relate to less optimal long-term outcomes following bariatric surgery and thus may be useful to assess in pre-surgical or early post-surgical evaluations to inform targeted recommendations.Copyright © 2019.

Previously, we reported a series of novel bicyclic and monocyclic ACC1-selective inhibitors. Among them, compound 1a exhibited highly potent cellular activity (acetate uptake IC = 0.76 nM) as well as promising in vivo PD efficacy. However, compound 1a caused severe  reduction in repeated dose administration in the mouse model. Since 1a showed potent inhibitory activity against mouse ACC1 as well as strong inhibition of mouse ACC2, we further examined a series of 1a analogues in order to reduce undesirable  change. The replacement of acetamide moiety with ureido moiety dramatically improved selectivity of mouse ACC1 against ACC2. In addition, analogue 1b displayed favorable bioavailability in mouse cassette dosing PK study, hence in vivo PD studies were also carried out. Oral administration of 1b significantly reduced the concentration of malonyl-CoA in HCT-116 xenograft tumors at doses of more than 30 mg/kg. Furthermore, compound 1b showed significant antitumor efficacy in 786-O xenograft mice at an oral dose of 30 mg/kg (T/C = 0.5%). Accordingly, our novel potent ACC1-selective inhibitor represents a set of useful orally-available research tools, as well as potential therapeutic agents particularly in terms of new cancer therapies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

C57BL/6 type 8 week-old male mice (n = 10/per group) were fed with standard chow or three isocaloric diets consisting fructose, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), or saturated fatty acid (SFA) for 15 weeks. After the dietary manipulation, the mice were sacrificed, tissues and blood were collected. Consequently,  gains, liver , and plasma homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values in were at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). The plasma concentrations of the non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), triglyceride (TG), and liver steatosis were found to be at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC1), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) in the liver were affected by the intake of SFA and fructose. Furthermore, the plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) and the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in the liver were elevated in SFA and fructose group (p < 0.05). The plasma level of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL -10) was found to be lower in the SFA group compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the inflammation and oxidation are related with the fatty acid- and fructose-induced impaired insulin signaling and fat accumulation in liver. Hence, in order to decrease the oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory response, it is substantial to reduce the saturated fat and added sugar or to replace with the unsaturated fat and complex carbohydrates in diet.Copyright © 2019.

While physical activity and intake of both calcium and vitamin D benefit BMD in older children, there is limited research on the determinants of good bone health in early childhood. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the impact of diet, physical activity, and  composition on BMD at five years of age. Dietary intakes and physical activity levels were measured through questionnaires. Whole  BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 102 children. Child , height, circumferences, skinfolds and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations were assessed. There was no association between BMD and dietary calcium, dietary vitamin D, 25OHD, physical activity, or sedentary behaviour. Several  of  composition were significantly positively associated with BMD; however, neither fat mass nor lean  mass was associated with BMD.Conclusion: Although we found no association between self-reported dietary and lifestyle factors and bone health in early years, increased  size was linked with higher BMD. These findings are important as identifying modifiable factors that can improve bone health at a young age is of utmost importance. What is Known: • Bone health is extremely important in early childhood, as children with low bone mineral density (BMD) are at greater risk of bone fractures. • Physical activity has been found to be beneficial for bone health in adolescents, and  composition has also been associated with BMD in teenage years. • Limited research on the determinants of good bone health in early childhood. What is New: • No association between self-reported lifestyle and dietary factors with bone health in early childhood. • Increased  size was associated with higher BMD at five years of age.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669519>Galectin-1 attenuates neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease model by modulating microglial MAPK/IκB/NFκB axis through its Carbohydrate-recognition domain.</a></h1><p>The vicious cycle between the chronicactivationofmicroglia and dopamine neurons degeneration is linked with the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Targeting microglialactivationhas proven to be a viable option to develop a disease-modified therapy for PD. Galectin-1, which has been reported to have an anti-neuroinflammation effect was used in the present study to evaluate its therapeutic effects on microglia activation and neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease model. It was found that galectin-1 attenuated the inflammatory insult and the apoptosis of SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells from conditioned medium of activated microglia induced by Lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Nonetheless, galectin-1 administration (0.5 mg/kg) inhibited the microglia activation, improved the motor deficits in PD mice model induced by MPTP (25 mg/kg  of mouse, i.p.) and prevented the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Administration of galectin-1 resulted in p38 and ERK1/2 dephosphorylation followed by IκB/NFκB signaling pathway inhibition. Galectin-1 significantly decreased the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and protein levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The protective effects and modulation of the MAPK/IκB/NFκB signaling pathway were abolished with β-D-galactose which blocked the carbohydrate-recognition domain of galectin-1. The present study demonstrated that galectin-1 inhibited microglia activation and ameliorated neurodegenerative process in PD model by modulating MAPK/IκB/NFκB axis through its Carbohydrate-recognition domain.Copyright © 2019.

High rates of mortality and tissue damage have been reported in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis. Bovine lactoferrin (BLF) is a well-known 80-kDa glycoprotein in the transferrin family that inhibits sepsis in low-birth- neonates. The present study investigated the protective effects of BLF in a rat model of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). The wet/dry ratio, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant markers, total protein, total cell count, inflammatory markers and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels were assessed. Histopathological analysis was also carried out. BLF treatment reduced the wet/dry ratio of lung tissue by 30.7% and 61.3%, and lipid peroxidation by 22.3% and 67%, at concentrations of 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) and catalase were increased by more than 50% under treatment with 200 mg/kg BLF. Inflammatory markers, neutrophils, lymphocytes and total cell count were reduced by more than 50% under treatment with 200 mg/kg BLF. BLF treatment significantly reduced MPO activity, by 28.2% and 74.3%, at concentrations of 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Neutrophilic infiltration and edema were observed in control rats. However, BLF treatment restored intestinal microvilli to the normal range and reduced inflammatory cell invasion. Collectively, these results suggest that BLF is an effective therapeutic agent against sepsis-induced ALI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673622>Percutaneous endoscopic versus radiologic gastrostomy for enteral feeding: a retrospective analysis on outcomes and complications.</a></h1><p>  Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy (PRG) are techniques used for long-term enteral feeding. Our primary aim was to analyze procedure-related and 30-day mortality and complications between PEG and PRG in relation to indications.   A single-center retrospective analysis was performed thath included all adult patients receiving initial PEG (January 2008 until April 2016) and PRG (January 2010 until April 2016). Outcomes were mortality (procedure-related, 30-day), complications (early (≤ 30 days) and late) and success rates.   A total of 760 procedures (469 PRG and 291 PEG) were analyzed. Most common indications were head and neck cancer (HNC), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Success rates for placement were 91.2 % for PEG and 97.1 % for PRG (   = 0.001). Procedure-related mortality was 1.7 % in PEG and 0.4 % in PRG (   = 0.113). The 30-day mortality was 10.7 % in PEG and 5.1 % in PRG (   = 0.481 after multivariate logistic regression) CVA was associated with higher 30-day mortality, whereas ALS, higher , and prophylactic placements in HNC were associated with lower rates. Tube-related complications were less frequent in PEG, both early (2.7 % vs. 26.4 %,   ≤ 0.001) and late (8.6 % vs. 31.5 %,   ≤ 0.001). The percentage of major complications and infections did not differ.   With respect to procedure-related and 30-day mortality, PEG and PRG compare equally. PRG had a higher procedural success rate. Tube-related complications and pain are less frequent after PEG compared to PRG. The choice for either PEG or PRG therefore should primarily be based on local facilities and expertise.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674171>Metabolic Bone Disease In Premature Neonates- An Unmet Challenge</a></h1><p><p>The metabolic bone disease is an important morbidity in premature, very low birth  and sick infants. If left undiagnosed, leads to structural deformities & spontaneous fractures.It is defined as impaired bone mineralization in a neonate with lower than the estimated bone mineral levels in either fetus or neonate of comparable gestational age /  coupled with biochemical abnormalities with or without radiological manifestations. It has been reported to occur in 16% to 40% of extremely low birth  neonates. Insufficient calcium and phosphorous stores during the phase of accelerated growth predispose to it along with use of medications (caffeine, steroids), prolonged parenteral nutrition & chronic immobilization. It presents by 6-16 weeks after birth. Enhanced physical activity in preterm infants facilitates bone mineralization and  gain. Biochemical abnormalities tend to worsen significantly, as the severity of disease progresses. They consist of hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperphosphatasia and secondary hyperparathyroidism. In addition, urinary phosphate wasting and hypo vitaminosis D can complicate these abnormalities. Conversely, biochemical abnormalities may not be accompanied by rachitic changes.</p> <p>Newer diagnostic modalities include bone densitometry by quantitative ultrasound over mid-tibial shaft (non-invasive tool). The management of metabolic bone disease includes adequate calcium, phosphorous and vitamin D supplementation along with optimum nutrition and physical activity. Similarly, preventive strategies for metabolic bone disease should target nutritional enhancement alongside enhanced physical activity.</p> <p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Metabolic bone disease is a preventable morbidity in preterm, VLBW neonates and requires optimum nutritional supplementation and enhanced physical activity.</p>.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672925>Influence of Educational Level on Psychosocial Correlates and Perceived Environmental Correlates of Physical Activity in Adults at Risk for Type 2 Diabetes: The Feel4Diabetes-Study.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to investigate whether the relationship between psychosocial and perceived environmental factors and physical activity (PA) in adults at risk for type 2 diabetes is influenced by educational level.Based on the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score questionnaire, this study selected 164 adults (Mage: 38 (5.34) y, 13.4% men) at type 2 diabetes risk from 11 low socioeconomic neighborhoods in Flanders (Belgium). Participants filled out questionnaires on psychosocial and perceived environmental factors and wore an ActiGraph accelerometer for 5 consecutive days. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of covariance in SPSS.Educational level significantly influenced the association between perception of  and light PA (P = .01) and total PA (P = .03) on weekend days. Educational level did not influence the associations between other psychosocial and perceived environmental factors (ie, perceived social influence; environmental, time and attitudinal barriers, perceived self-efficacy; knowledge and fatalism) and PA.Educational level did not influence the relationship between most psychosocial and perceived environmental factors and PA in this sample of adults at type 2 diabetes risk. This suggests that addressing different psychosocial and perceived environmental correlates in lower and higher educated participants might not be necessary.

The average molecular  of BGP4-I, as determined by high performance gel permeation chromatography, was 123.43 kDa. The structure of BGP4-I was characterized based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, etc. Based on the nano-liquid chromatography-coupled electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of the amino acid sequence of BGP4-I, belongs unequivocally to the glycosyl hydrolase family 1 in the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database by alignment studies. The specific activity of BGP4-I was 18.44 μmol/min/mg on the substrate p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. Furthermore, BGP4-I is unique in its specificity for some substrates. These results suggest that the BGP4-I from tartary buckwheat seeds is a novel specific β-glucosidase setting the foundation for potential applications in the food industry.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Calves were randomised to receive meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of placebo subcutaneously at birth. Calf blood samples were collected between one and seven days of age to determine serum immunoglobulin (IgG) concentration. Colostrum intake, treatment for disease, mortality, and weaning  were recorded. Multilevel linear or logistic regression models were used to determine the effects of meloxicam and to identify risk factors.There was no effect of meloxicam on serum IgG concentrations, average daily gain (ADG), or risk of inadequate TPI (serum IgG concentration <24 g/l), treatment for disease, or mortality (P>0.05). Bottle or tube feeding calves were associated with decreased serum IgG concentrations (P=0.01) compared with nursing. Calves with an incomplete tongue withdrawal reflex had higher odds of being treated for disease compared with those with complete withdrawal (P=0.009). Being born meconium-stained and having decreased serum IgG concentrations were associated with an increased risk of mortality (P=0.03). Being born of a mature cow, having a higher birth , and increased serum IgG concentrations were associated with greater ADG to weaning (P<0.05).Vigour assessment at birth along with good colostrum management may be important to improve TPI and health in high-risk calves such as those assisted at birth.© British Veterinary Association 2019.

The physiological basis of molybdenum phytotoxicity is poorly understood. Plants take up molybdenum as molybdate, which is a structural analogue of sulfate. Therefore, it is presumed that elevated molybdate concentrations may hamper the uptake and subsequent metabolism of sulfate, which may induce sulfur deficiency. In the current research, Chinese cabbage (Brassica pekinensis) seedlings were exposed to 50, 100, 150 and 200 μM Na MoO for nine days. Leaf chlorosis and a decreased plant growth occurred at concentrations ≥ 100 μM. Root growth was more affected than shoot growth. At ≥ 100 μM Na MoO , the sulfate uptake rate and capacity were increased, though only when expressed on a root fresh  basis. When expressed on a whole plant fresh  basis, which corrects for the impact of molybdate on the shoot-to-root ratio, the sulfate uptake rate and capacity remained unaffected. Molybdate concentrations ≥ 100 μM altered the mineral nutrient composition of plant tissues, although the levels of sulfur metabolites (sulfate, water-soluble non-protein thiols and total sulfur) were not altered. Moreover, the levels of nitrogen metabolites (nitrate, amino acids, proteins and total nitrogen), which are generally strongly affected by sulfate deprivation, were not affected. The root water-soluble non-protein thiol content was increased and the tissue nitrate levels decreased, only at 200 μM Na MoO . Evidently, molybdenum toxicity in Chinese cabbage was not due to the direct interference of molybdate with the uptake and subsequent metabolism of sulfate.© 2019 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671164>Effect of antenatal detection of small-for-gestational-age newborns in a risk stratified retrospective cohort.</a></h1><p>Small-for-gestational-age (SGA) are neonates born with birth  below the 10th centile for a given week of pregnancy. It is a risk factor of perinatal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is an ongoing debate whether prenatal detection of SGA neonates is good predictor of perinatal outcome especially in low risk populations. Our primary aim was to compare the odds ratios for unfavorable outcome in a risk stratified cohort of SGA neonates in regard to prenatal detection status.This is a retrospective cohort study analysing the effect of prenatal detection on perinatal outcome. This cohort has been divided into a predefined low-risk and high-risk population. Electronic records of 39,032 singleton deliveries from 2010 through 2016 were analysed. SGA was defined as newborn  below the 10th percentile on the Fenton growth chart. Detected SGA (dSGA) neonates were those that were admitted for delivery with a prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of abnormal growth. Undetected SGA (uSGA) were neonates that were found to be below the 10th percentile after birth. Perinatal and neonatal outcome was compared.The detection rate in high-risk pregnancies was almost 45.7% versus low risk where it amounted to 18.9%. In both the high-risk and low-risk populations there was a significantly higher risk of composite mortality for undetected SGA compared to approporiate-for-gestational-age (AGA) (OR 7.95 CI 4.76-13.29; OR 14.4 CI 4.99-41.45 respectively). The odds for the composite neonatal outcome were significantly higher for dSGA and uSGA than for AGA in all the studied populations except for the uSGA in high risk population (OR 1.57 CI 0.97-3.53). Importantly, there was not a single case of intrauterine fetal death among detected SGA, in the low risk group.Prenatal detection of SGA status is related to perinatal outcomes, especially mortality. Therefore, assessment of SGA status even in low-risk pregnancies could help predict potential perinatal and neonatal complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673997>Benefits of thymol supplementation on performance, the hepatic antioxidant system, and energetic metabolism in grass carp.</a></h1><p>Thymol is an herbal food additive used to improve animal performance. Thymol acts via its potential to enhance productive and reproductive performance, and by improving bioavailability of nutrients in fish. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms associated with these phenomena remain poorly understood, although recent evidence has suggested the involvement of the phosphotransfer network and antioxidant status. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether the improvement of the antioxidant/oxidant status and the phosphoryl transfer network may be involved in enhanced growth performance in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) fed with various levels of thymol (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg feed). Thymol-supplementation (100 mg/kg feed) produced higher  and  gain for 60-day post-feeding compared to the control group. Specific growth rate was higher; while feed conversion ratio was lower in fish that consumed 100 mg of thymol/kg compared to other groups. Hepatic lactate dehydrogenase activity and lipid peroxidation levels were lower in the thymol-supplemented group (100 mg/kg feed) than in the control group, while reactive oxygen species were lower in all supplemented groups than in the control group. Hepatic superoxide dismutase (300 mg/kg feed) and glutathione peroxidase (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg feed) activities, as well as antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (100 mg/kg feed) were higher in these groups than in the control group. Based on these data, we conclude that 100 mg thymol/kg dietary supplementation increased growth performance of fingerling grass carp. Finally, hepatic adenylate kinase activity was lower in the thymol supplemented group (100 mg/kg feed) than in the control group. Thymol supplementation (100 mg/kg feed) improved hepatic energy metabolism, while practically all tested concentrations of thymol enhanced hepatic antioxidant status, all of which may be pathways involved in increased growth performance in fingerling grass carp.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671825>Contribution of Host Immune Responses Against Influenza D Virus Infection Toward Secondary Bacterial Infection in a Mouse Model.</a></h1><p>Influenza D viruses (IDV) are known to co-circulate with viral and bacterial pathogens in cattle and other ruminants. Currently, there is limited knowledge regarding host responses to IDV infection and whether IDV infection affects host susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. To begin to address this gap in knowledge, the current study utilized a combination of  and  approaches to evaluate host cellular responses against primary IDV infection and secondary bacterial infection with . Primary IDV infection in mice did not result in clinical signs of disease and it did not enhance the susceptibility to secondary  infection. Rather, IDV infection appeared to protect mice from the usual clinical features of secondary bacterial infection, as demonstrated by improved  loss, survival, and recovery when compared to  infection alone. We found a notable increase in IFN-β expression following IDV infection while utilizing human alveolar epithelial A549 cells to analyze early anti-viral responses to IDV infection. These results demonstrate for the first time that IDV infection does not increase the susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection with , with evidence that anti-viral immune responses during IDV infection might protect the host against these potentially deadly outcomes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670905>Methylphenidate in children with monogenic obesity due to LEPR or MC4R deficiency improves feeling of satiety and reduces BMI-SDS-A case series.</a></h1><p>The clinical phenotype of patients with monogenic obesity due to mutations in the leptin receptor (LEPR) or melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene is characterized by impaired satiety and hyperphagia, leading to extreme, sometimes life-threatening  gain.In a case series, we analysed the effect of an off-label methylphenidate (MPH) use for 1 year as an individual treatment approach on eating behaviour (Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire [CEBQ]), appetite (visual analogue scales) and  mass index (BMI) trajectories in five patients with severe obesity due to mutations in the LEPR (n = 3) or MC4R (n = 2) gene.After 1 year use of MPH (20 mg/day divided in two to three doses), BMI (Δ BMI  : -0.7 ± 0.9 kg/m ), BMI standard deviation score (SDS) (Δ BMI-SDS  : -0.32 ± 0.20), and %BMIP95 (Δ %BMIP95  : -6.6 ± 7.8%) decreased. BMI-SDS velocity decreased from +0.17 ± 0.22 to -0.30 ± 0.20. Appetite and CEBQ subscale scores for "food responsiveness" and "enjoyment of food" decreased. We observed adverse effects with increase in self-reported frequency of disordered sleep, nervousness, hyperactivity, and tics.The observed decrease in BMI trajectories with MPH use for one year is clinically meaningful in this group of patients, since the natural course would have been associated with a pronounced increase in BMI, leading to comorbidities and complications over time.© 2019 The Authors.

The XRD pattern analysis showed the systematic decrease in the lattice parameters owing to the enhanced oxidation states of the Co/Mn ions. The electronic structure study by XPS measurements suggested the presence of mixed valence states of the B-site ions (Co2+/Co3+ and Mn3+/Mn4+) with significant enhancement of the average oxidation states due to hole doping. The mere absence of electronic states near the Fermi level in the valence band (VB) spectra for both of the pure (x=0.0) and Sr doped (x=0.5) systems indicated the insulating nature of the samples. Sr substitution is observed to increase the spectral  near the Fermi level suggesting for an enhanced conductivity of the hole doped system. The dc magnetization data divulged a Griffiths like phase above the long-range ordering temperature. A typical re-entrant spin glass like phase driven by the inherent anti-site disorder (ASD) has been recognized by ac susceptibility study for both the pure and doped systems. Most interestingly, the emergence of a new cluster glass like phase (immediately below the magnetic ordering temperature and above the spin-glass transition temperature) solely driven by the Sr substitution has been unravelled by ac magnetization dynamics study. Observation of these dual glassy states in a single system is scarce and hence placed the present system amongst the rare materials. The isothermal magnetization measurements further probed the exhibition of the giant exchange bias effect originated from the interfacial exchange interactions due to existence of low temperature antiferromagnetic clusters embedded in the glassy matrix.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675673>Antidepressant and antinociceptive activities in animal models and in vitro assessment of the anti-thyroid activity of bis(DL-pyroglutamate)magnesium complex.</a></h1><p>Magnesium is an essential element related with biochemistry of the brain and different types of depression have been associated with its deficiency.The structure of a novel magnesium bis(DL-pyroglutamate) (Mg(DL-pGlu)) was elucidated by X-ray crystallography. Wistar rats were used in the in vivo experiments. The antidepressant-like effect was assessed by the forced swim test (FST) and the antinociceptive activity was evaluated using hot plate test. In both, non-specific effects were evaluated by the open field test. Anti-thyroid activity was examined using Lang's method. Albumin binding behavior was evaluated by 3D fluorescence spectroscopy.For the Mg(DL-pGlu) complex (30 mg/kg), the FST test on Wistar rats revealed a decrease of 22% in the immobility time and an increment of 106% in the swimming time. The compound alters neither the locomotor activity nor the  after chronic administration. At the same dose, it showed antinociceptive activity, increasing the response latency. It blocks iodination reactions generating a charge transfer complex with iodine hence indicating anti-thyroid activity (K = 45366.5 ± 29 M). Albumin 3D fluorescence spectroscopy experiments showed intensity increase of peak A and decrease of peak B.The results showed that the new compound produced a lowering of the immobility time and an increment of the swimming ability of the rats. The compound is able to increase the response latency in 70.0%, to capture iodine (anti-thyroid activity) and to interact with albumin through covalent type of interaction of the free NH groups.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

Although some progress has been made in the past years, the pathogenesis of ALI is still poorly understood and the therapeutic outcome has still not been significantly improved. It is well-recognized that magnesium sulfate (MgSO) possesses potent anti-inflammation capacity. The present study was designed to investigate the protective effects of MgSO in lipopolysaccharides (LPSs)-induced ALI taken into account that excessive inflammatory response plays critical role in the development of ALI. In this study, Kunming mice were intravenously injected with LPS through tail vein to establish the ALI model and in parallel, A549 cells were used to establish cell model. The lung wet-to-dry  ratio, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in lung tissue, lung permeability index, hematoxylin and eosin staining, cytokines in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), neutrophil counts in BALF, LPS-induced A549 cell apoptosis as well as apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) expression in both mice and A549 cells were detected. Our results demonstrated that MgSO significantly attenuated the LPS-induced ALI, oxidative stress (decreased MDA levels), and lung inflammatory response. Moreover, MgSO exerted protective effects by mitigating LPS-induced A549 cell apoptosis. Furthermore, MgSO decreased the AIF and PARP-1 expression both in vivo and in vitro. Our results, taken together, demonstrated that MgSO is a potential therapeutic agent for ALI taken into consideration that MgSO is commonly used in clinical settings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669925>Do Asian and North American patients with bipolar disorder have similar efficacy, tolerability, and safety profile during clinical trials with atypical antipsychotics?</a></h1><p>The approvals of psychotropics for bipolar disorder (BD) are mainly based on randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) from North America. It remains unknown whether approved psychotropics have similar efficacy, tolerability, and safety for Asians with BD. The aim of this systematic review was to compare those differences of psychotropics between Asians and North Americans with BD.MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched for RCTs studied in two regions. The effect size, remission/response rate, and risk for discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs),  gain (WG), nervous systems and gastrointestinal AEs were assessed and compared between two regions with Cohen's d or number needed to treat/harm.Eleven studies of aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine in BD were included. Similar efficacy and relatively benign tolerability of atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) between Asians and Americans with BD were observed in most studies. The risk for AAP-related WG was similar between two regions. Asians with mania or bipolar depression were more vulnerable to akathisia/tremor or constipation. Japanese and Chinese with bipolar depression were more sensitive to somnolence and dizziness, respectively. Americans were more likely to have dry mouth, nausea, and vomiting.The number of included psychotropics and papers was small.Differences in AAP-related efficacy and tolerability were minimal between the two regions, but some AEs appeared to be different.

To date, mid- and long-term results of calcar-guided short-stem designs have been rarely available.Two hundred and sixteen calcar-guided short stems were included in combination with a cementless cup in a prospective study. Patients were allowed full -bearing on the first day postoperatively. Harris hip score (HHS) as well as pain and satisfaction on visual analogue scale (VAS) were assessed during a median follow-up of 61.7 months. Standardised radiographs were analysed at predefined time points regarding radiological alterations such as bone resorption and remodelling, radiolucency, osteolysis and cortical hypertrophy using modified Gruen zones.At mid-term follow-up, no revision surgery of the stem had to be performed in the whole collective. At 5 years, HHS was 97.8 (SD 4.7), satisfaction on VAS was 9.7 (SD 0.7), rest pain on VAS was 0.1 (SD 0.5), and load pain on VAS was 0.6 (SD 1.2). Compared to the 2-year results, femoral bone resorption increased significantly at the 5-year follow-up (3.9% versus 42.3%). Rate of femoral cortical hypertrophy remained stable, occurring in a total of 9 hips (4.5%). At the 5-year follow-up, 2 stems (1.0%) showed non-progressive radiolucent lines with a maximum width of 2 mm. Signs of osteolysis were not observed. Compared to the 2-year follow-up, no further subsidence was observed.The rate of stem revision (0%) at the mid-term follow-up was remarkable and indicates the principle of using a calcar-guided short stem as being a safe procedure.

After evaluating the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the selected studies were analyzed according to strength training methods and the training variables used to measure EE.We identified two ST methods from the literature review: circuit training (CT) and traditional training (TT). Meta-analysis showed a significant effect on EE increase, which favor TT when compared with CT (-0.99 [95%CI: -1.96, -0.02], p < 0.01) with I of 89% (p < 0.01). After adjusting for bias risk, no significant differences were found in EE associated with intensity (-0.40, 95% CI [0.98, 0.18], p = 0.18).The present review and meta-analysis indicated that the intensity of exercise does not seem to be associated with an increase of EE in ST.© 2019 Scandinavian Society of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine.

Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in energy and glucose homeostasis, thus postoperative changes of their circulating levels may be mediating future  loss. To investigate how the circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones change in response to the most common types of bariatric operation and whether these changes can predict future  loss.We measured circulating GLP-1, GLP-2, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), ghrelin, GIP, PYY after overnight fasting and/or after a mixed meal test (MMT) in: a) 14 subjects that have undergone either an adjustable gastric banding [AGB] (n = 9) or a Roux-en-Y bypass (RYGB) (n = 5) (Pilot study 1), b) 28 subjects that have undergone either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 17) or a RYGB (n = 11) before and three, six and twelve months after surgery.In addition to the expected associations with GLP-1, the most robust increases were observed in postprandial levels of oxyntomodulin and glicentin three months after VSG or RYGB (but not after AGB) and are associated with degree of  loss. Oxyntomodulin and glicentin levels at the third and sixth month postoperative visit are positively associated with feeling of satiety which may be underlying the observed associations with future  loss.Beyond GLP-1, early postprandial changes in circulating oxyntomodulin and glicentin are predictors of  loss after bariatric surgery, possibly through regulation of satiety. Further studies should focus on underlying mechanisms, and their potential as attractive therapeutic tools against obesity and related comorbidities.Copyright © 2019.

Particularly, the CNTs and CB have been subjected to us sonication for different time intervals and the performed analysis reveals that both kinds of nanoparticles show decreased average hydrodynamic diameters and large content of surface defects. Really, the increased content of CNTs and CB defects, achieved during the sonication time, leads to an increased reactivity toward 1,1-diphenyl-2-pycryl (DPPH) radicals and an enhanced anti-oxidant activity toward macro-radicals, coming from the photo-degradation of the host polymer matrix. The studies of photo-oxidative behavior of the nanocomposites, based on Ultra High Molecular  (UHMWPE), reveal that the us treatment of the nanoparticles has a benefic effect on the oxidative resistance of the nanocomposites, especially at long exposure times. Overall, the ultra-sound-assisted treatment can be considered twofold powerful tool: (i) for disruption of the nanoparticles aggregations, and (ii) for capitalization of surface defects, amplifying and tuning in a controlled way the radical scavenging activity of the carbonaceous nanoparticles.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The captive groups were each fed different diets, while the wild groups experienced different ecological conditions. Three different growth curve models were compared.By 800 days, the wild juveniles were lighter, with a slower maximum growth rate, and reached asymptote earlier than their captive counterparts. There were overall differences in  and growth rate across the two wild cohorts. This corresponded to differences in resource availability. There was considerable overlap in growth rate and predicted adult  of male and females in the first, but not the second, wild cohort. Maternal parity was not influential. While the von Bertalanffy curve provided the best fit to the data sets modeled together, the Logistic curve best described growth in the wild cohorts when considered separately.The growth curves of the two captive cohorts are likely to lie near the maximum attainable by juvenile vervets. It may be helpful to include deviations from these rates when assessing the performance of wild vervet monkeys. The comparison of wild and captive juveniles confirmed the value of comparing different growth curve models, and an appreciation that the best models may well differ for different populations. Choice of mechanistic growth model can, therefore, be empirically justified, rather than theoretically predetermined.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672123>CTNS mRNA molecular analysis revealed a novel mutation in a child with infantile nephropathic cystinosis: a case report.</a></h1><p>Cystinosis is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by accumulation of cystine in lysosomes throughout the . Cystinosis is caused by mutations in the CTNS gene that encodes the lysosomal cystine carrier protein cystinosin. CTNS mutations result in either complete absence or reduced cystine transporting function of the protein. The diagnosis of nephropathic cystinosis is generally based on measuring leukocyte cystine level, demonstration of corneal cystine crystals by the slit lamp examination and confirmed by genetic analysis of the CTNS gene.A boy born to consanguineous Caucasian parents had the characteristic clinical features of the infantile nephropathic cystinosis including renal Fanconi syndrome (polydipsia/polyuria, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, low molecular  proteinuria, glycosuria, cystine crystals in the cornea) and elevated WBC cystine levels. Initially we performed RFLP analysis of the common in the Northern European population 57-kb deletion of proband's DNA, then a direct Sanger sequencing which revealed no mutations in the coding part of the CTNS gene. To confirm the diagnosis we performed RT-PCR analysis of total RNA obtained from patient-derived fibroblasts in combination with cDNA sequencing. This revealed the skipping of exon 4 and exon 5 in the CTNS in our patient. Therefore, we detected a novel 9-kb homozygous deletion in the CTNS gene at genomic DNA level, spanning region from intron 3 to intron 5. In order to identify the inheritance pattern of the deletion we analyzed DNA of proband's mother and father. Both parents were found to be heterozygous carriers of the CTNS mutation.Analysis of CTNS gene transcript allowed to identify a large homozygous deletion in the patient with infantile nephropathic cystinosis. Mutational detection at RNA level may be an efficient tool to establish the genetic defect in some cystinosis patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671827>Effect of Ambient Oxygen Content, Safety Shoe Type, and Lifting Frequency on Subject's MAWL and Physiological Responses.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the lifting capabilities of individuals in hypoxia when they wear different types of safety shoes and to investigate the behavior of the physiological responses induced by the lifting process associated with those variables.An experimental design was used, based on two sessions. The first was training and acclimatization session, then an experimental lifting phase. A total of ten male students of King Saud University were recruited in the study. A four-way repeated  design, with four independent variables and six dependent variables, was used in this research. The independent variables that were studied in the experimental lifting phase were: ambient oxygen content (15%, 18%, and 21%), safety shoes type (light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty), lifting frequency (1 and 4 lifts/min), and replication (first and second trials). The dependent variables were also: maximum acceptable  lifting using the psychophysical technique, heart rate (HR), electromyography (EMG) of (biceps brachii, trapezius, anterior deltoid, and erector spinae), safety shoes discomfort rating, rating of perceived exertion, and ambient oxygen discomfort rating.The maximum acceptable  lifting that were selected by participants at lower levels of the independent variables (ambient oxygen content 21%, lifting frequency 1 lift/min, and first replication) were significantly higher than at high levels of the independent variables (ambient oxygen content 15%, lifting frequency 4 lift/min, and second replication). Several interaction effects were also significant.It provides evidence that the ambient oxygen content increases the intensity of workload in lifting tasks. It showed that oxygen content affects the psychophysical selection of maximum acceptable  lifting and the physiological responses represented in muscular activities and heart rate. It suggests that ambient oxygen content must be considered along with the type of safety shoes worn when the lifting task at altitudes occurs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672447>The Rho GTPase RND3 regulates adipocyte lipolysis.</a></h1><p>Adipose tissue plays a crucial role in diet- and obesity-related insulin resistance, with implications for several metabolic diseases. Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type 2 diabetes, in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and insulin-mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human obesity, and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte metabolism. In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed 5-fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in obesity, reduced levels after surgery-induced  loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate  of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte lipolysis and insulin signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.5-2-fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in obesity and insulin resistance, which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019.

The study aimed to investigate in vitro antioxidant, antiproliferative, apoptotic, and antibacterial activities of broccoli sprouts. Five-day-old sprouts extracted by 70% ethanol showed significant antioxidant activities, analyzed to be 68.8 μmol Trolox equivalent (TE)/g dry  by 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic (ABTS) assay, 91% scavenging by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, 1.81 absorbance by reducing power assay, and high phenolic contents by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Thereafter, sprout extract indicated considerable antiproliferative activities towards A549 (lung carcinoma cells), HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma cells), and Caco-2 (colorectal adenocarcinoma cells) using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, with IC values of 0.117, 0.168 and 0.189 mg/mL for 48 h, respectively. Furthermore, flow cytometry confirmed that Caco-2 cells underwent apoptosis by an increase of cell percentage in subG1 phase to 31.3%, and a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential to 19.3% after 48 h of treatment. Afterward, the extract exhibited notable antibacterial capacities against  and  Typhimurium with minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values of 0.39 and 0.78 mg/mL, appropriately, along with abilities against  and  with an MIC value of 1.56 mg/mL.

Some data suggest that there is a significant influence of sex hormone balance on the susceptibility of bone to antiepileptic drug-induced bone loss.Forty-eight male Wistar rats were divided into six groups that were subjected to two surgeries, sham (noORX) or real orchidectomy (ORX), and were fed three diets, a SLD, a SLD enriched with GBP or a SLD enriched with PGB. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to measure the bone mineral density. The concentrations of bone turnover markers were assayed. The femurs were biomechanically tested.Significant reductions in bone mineral density,  and biomechanical strength were observed in ORX animals. GBP or PGB exposure did not cause significant alterations in bone mineral density or biomechanical strength. No changes in bone turnover markers were observed, except for RANKL. A significant increase was found in the ORX GBP and ORX PGB groups. Within the orchidectomized animal group, RANKL levels were significantly higher in the ORX PGB group than in the ORX GBP group.Because neither GBP nor PGB affected bone mineral density or mechanical bone strength, both of these antiepileptic drugs could be considered drugs with lower risks to bone health. A shift in RANKL levels indicates that the effects of GBP and PGB on osteoclast activity may be dependent on the hormonal status of animals.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

The primary end point was set as the change of fatty liver index (FLI) as a surrogate parameter of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Six-hundred and ninety-seven subjects (38 with T2DM) were enrolled. A baseline FLI ≥ 60 (the threshold for fatty liver) was found in 264 subjects (37.9%). The mean duration of fasting was 8.5 ± 4.0 days (range 6-38). FLI decreased significantly (-14.02 ± 11.67;  < 0.0001), with a larger effect in individuals with T2DM (-19.15 ± 11.0;  < 0.0001;  = 0.002 compared to non-diabetic subjects).  mass index (BMI) decreased by -1.51 ± 0.82 kg/m, and 49.9% of the subjects lost ≥5% . After fasting, nearly half of the 264 subjects with FLI ≥ 60 (highest risk category) shifted to a lower category. The improvement of FLI correlated with the number of fasting days (r = -0.20,  < 0.0001) and with the magnitude of BMI reduction (r = 0.14,  = 0.0001).

A prospective cohort study.</a></h1><p>To evaluate the short-term impact of long-distance running on knee joints using MRI.82 healthy adults participating in their first marathon underwent 3T (Tesla) MRI of both knees 6 months before and half a month after the marathon: 71 completed both the 4 month-long standardised training programme and the marathon; and 11 dropped-out during training and did not run the marathon. Two senior musculoskeletal radiologists graded the internal knee structures using validated scoring systems. Participants completed Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score questionnaires at each visit for self-reporting knee function.Premarathon and pretraining MRI showed signs of damage, without symptoms, to several knee structures in the majority of the 82 middle-aged volunteers. However, after the marathon, MRI showed a reduction in the radiological score of damage in: subchondral bone marrow oedema in the condyles of the tibia (p=0.011) and femur (p=0.082). MRI did also show an increase in radiological scores to the following structures: cartilage of the lateral patella (p=0.0005); semimembranosus tendon (p=0.016); iliotibial band (p<0.0001) and the prepatellar bursa (p=0.016).Improvement to damaged subchondral bone of the tibial and femoral condyles was found following the marathon in novice runners, as well as worsening of the patella cartilage although asymptomatic. This is the most robust evidence to link marathon running with knee joint health and provides important information for those seeking to understand the link between long distance running and osteoarthritis of the main -bearing areas of the knee.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, SGA treatment is associated with severe metabolic alterations and  gain, which can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and greatly accelerate mortality. Several underlying mechanisms have been proposed for antipsychotic-induced  gain (AIWG), but some studies suggest that metabolic changes in insulin-sensitive tissues can be triggered before the onset of AIWG. In this review, we give an outlook on current research about the metabolic disturbances provoked by SGAs, with a particular focus on whole- glucose homeostasis disturbances induced independently of AIWG, lipid dysregulation or adipose tissue disturbances. Specifically, we discuss the mechanistic insights gleamed from cellular and preclinical animal studies that have reported on the impact of SGAs on insulin signaling, endogenous glucose production, glucose uptake and insulin secretion in the liver, skeletal muscle and the endocrine pancreas. Finally, we discuss some of the genetic and epigenetic changes that might explain the different susceptibilities of SGA-treated patients to the metabolic side-effects of antipsychotics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673826>Population pharmacokinetics of methotrexate in Mexican pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</a></h1><p>To develop and validate a population pharmacokinetic model of Methotrexate (MTX) in Mexican children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) for the design of personalized dosage regimens based on the anthropometric and physiological characteristics of each patient.A prospective study was developed in 50 children (1-15 years old) with ALL diagnosis attended at Pediatric Hemato-Oncology Service from Hospital Central "Dr. Ignacio Morones Prieto" and under treatment with high doses of MTX administered in 24-h continuous intravenous infusion. Plasma concentrations of MTX were determined in blood samples collected at 24, 36, 42 or 48 h post-infusion, by means of the CMIA immunoassay. The development of the population pharmacokinetic model was performed using the NONMEM software evaluating the covariates that influence in clearance (CL), intercompartmental clearance (Q), central (V) and peripheral (V) volume of distribution of MTX.A two-compartment open model was selected to describe concentration-time data and  surface area (BSA) was the covariate that influences on MTX total CL. The population pharmacokinetic model obtained was: CL (L/h) = 6.5 × BSA, V (L) = 0.36 × , Q (L/h) = 0.41 and V (L) = 3.2. Internal validation was performed by bootstrap and visual predictive check. Predictive performance of final model was evaluated by external validation in a different group of patients. Initial MTX dosing regimens were established by stochastic simulation with final population pharmacokinetic model.The establishment of MTX dosing criteria in children with ALL should be adjusted based on the BSA of each patient to optimize oncological therapy and reduce the development of adverse effects.

A subsample of 59 patients filled out the same questionnaires at a 6-month follow-up after discharge.Findings evidenced statistically significant changes in all outcome  at both discharge and follow-up. Between 30.1 and 38.6% of patients at discharge and 35.2-54.2% at the 6-month follow-up showed clinically significant symptomatic change; additionally, 19.8-29.1% of patients at discharge and 22.9-38.3% at follow-up improved reliably. However, 34.9-39.8% remained unchanged and 2-4.8% worsened. At the 6-month follow-up, 21.3-25.9% showed no symptomatic change and 0-3.7% had deteriorated.

Quality of life is often affected, and patients should be screened for depression. Treatment includes wearing loose-fitting clothes, losing  if overweight, and smoking cessation. Topical clindamycin alone can be effective for patients with mild disease. Patients with moderate disease can be treated with oral antibiotics, such as tetracyclines, in addition to topical clindamycin.

However, evidence of the benefit and harm associated with specific low molecular  heparins such as enoxaparin is dated. No current systematic review and meta-analysis describing the safety and efficacy of enoxaparin for thromboembolism and thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy exists.PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched on August 17, 2018 for clinical trials or observational studies in pregnant women receiving enoxaparin; patients with a prosthetic heart valve were excluded. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random effects model, and heterogeneity was measured using the I statistic.Of the 485 records identified in the search, 24 studies published clinical trials, and observational studies were found dating back to 2000. Only one observational cohort and one randomized control trial focused on the use of enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis and therefore efficacy was not assessed; the other studies included women with recurrent pregnancy loss (15 studies), history of placental vascular complications (five studies), and recurrent in vitro fertilization failure (two studies) and were therefore analyzed in terms of safety only. Bleeding events were non-significantly more often reported for enoxaparin compared to untreated controls (RR 1.35 [0.88-2.07]) but less often reported for enoxaparin versus aspirin (RR 0.93 [0.62-1.39]); thromboembolic events, thrombocytopenia, and teratogenicity were rarely reported events; in patients with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss, encouragingly the rates of pregnancy loss were significantly lower for enoxaparin compared to untreated controls (RR 0.58 [0.34-0.96]) and enoxaparin + aspirin versus aspirin alone (RR 0.42 [0.32-0.56]) as well as observably lower for enoxaparin versus aspirin alone (RR 0.39 [0.15-1.01]), though significant heterogeneity was observed (I > 60).Literature on the efficacy and safety of enoxaparin for thromboembolism and thromboprophylaxis remains scanty, and therefore efficacy was not assessed; in terms of safety, when including other indications for enoxaparin in pregnancy, we found that enoxaparin was associated with significantly lower complications than aspirin. Given differences in study design and study heterogeneity, pregnancy loss results should be interpreted with caution. Moreover, reports of thromboembolic events, thrombocytopenia, and congenital malformations were rare.Sanofi.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671610>Rice Novel Semidwarfing Gene  Can Be as Effective as Green Revolution Gene .</a></h1><p>Gene effects on the yield performance were compared among promising semidwarf genes, namely, novel gene , representative gene  with different two source IR8 and Jukkoku, and double dwarf combinations of  with each  allele, in a Koshihikari background.

Such risk assessment currently relies on summary statistics gathered in standardized laboratory studies. However, these statistics extract only limited information and depend on duration of exposure. Their extrapolation to realistic ecological scenarios is inherently limited. Mechanistic effect models simulate the processes underlying toxicity and so have the potential to overcome these issues. Toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TK-TD) models operate at the individual level, predicting the internal concentration of a chemical over time and the stress it places on an organism. TK-TD models are particularly suited to addressing the difference in exposure patterns between laboratory (constant) and field (variable) scenarios. So far, few studies have sought to predict sublethal effects of pesticide exposure to wild mammals in the field, even though such effects are of particular interest with respect to longer term exposure. We developed a TK-TD model based on the dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory, which can be parametrized and tested solely using standard regulatory studies. We demonstrate that this approach can be used effectively to predict toxic effects on the  of rats over time. Model predictions separate the impacts of feeding avoidance and toxic action, highlighting which was the primary driver of effects on growth. Such information is relevant to the ecological risk posed by a compound because in the environment alternative food sources may or may not be available to focal species. While this study focused on a single end point, growth, this approach could be expanded to include reproductive output.

However, the IZUMO1-IZUMO1R interaction does not appear to be directly responsible for promoting the fusion of the gamete membranes, suggesting that this critical phase of the fertilization cascade requires the concerted action of alternative fusogenic machinery. It has therefore been proposed that IZUMO1 may play a secondary role in the organization and/or stabilization of higher-order heteromeric complexes in spermatozoa that are required for membrane fusion.Here, we show that fertilization-competent (acrosome reacted) mouse spermatozoa harbor several high molecular  protein complexes, a subset of which are readily able to adhere to solubilized oolemmal proteins. At least two of these complexes contain IZUMO1 in partnership with GLI pathogenesis-related 1 like 1 (GLIPR1L1). This interaction is associated with lipid rafts and is dynamically remodeled upon the induction of acrosomal exocytosis in preparation for sperm adhesion to the oolemma. Accordingly, the selective ablation of GLIPR1L1 leads to compromised sperm function characterized by a reduced ability to undergo the acrosome reaction and a failure of IZUMO1 redistribution.Collectively, this study characterizes multimeric protein complexes on the sperm surface and identifies GLIPRL1L1 as a physiologically relevant regulator of IZUMO1 function and the fertilization process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672669>Factors Mediating Type 2 Diabetes Remission and Relapse after Gastric Bypass Surgery.</a></h1><p>Defining factors associated with remission and relapse of type 2 diabetes (T2D) after gastric bypass (RYGB) may allow targeting modifiable factors. We investigated factors associated with T2D remission and relapse after RYGB.Retrospective review of consecutive patients with T2D who underwent RYGB between 1993 and 2017. T2D remission was defined as medications discontinuation and/or HbA1c<6.5%; relapse was defined as recurrent medication use and/or HbA1c≥6.5%. Independent correlates of T2D remission and relapse were identified using logistic regression.621 patients (aged 46.7±10.6 years; 30% on insulin; BMI 49.8±8.3 kg/m) had at least one-year follow-up. Median follow-up was 4.9 (range 1-23.6) years. Prevalence of T2D remission was 74% at one year, 73% from one to three years, 63% between 3 and 10 years, and 47% beyond 10 years. 93% of remissions occurred within 3 years of RYGB, 25% relapsed. The median (IQR) time to relapse was 5.3 (3-7.8) years after remission. Higher one-year percentage total  (%TBW) loss, lack of preoperative insulin use, and younger age at surgery were independently associated with T2D remission. Preoperative insulin use, lower %TBW loss at one year, and greater %TBW gain after one year were independently associated with T2D relapse.This longitudinal retrospective analysis shows that preoperative insulin use and age, one-year  loss, and regain after that influence T2D remission and relapse following RYGB. Referring patients at a younger age, before insulin is needed, and optimizing both  loss and  maintenance after RYGB may improve the rates and durability of T2D remission.Copyright © 2019.

Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the association between objectively measured PA and different clinical adiposity  in a large sample of preschoolers.Four hundred sixty-three predominantly normal- (77%) 2-6-year-old preschool children participated in the Swiss Preschoolers' Health Study (SPLASHY). Physical activity was measured using accelerometers and was analyzed using 15-s (uni-axial) epoch length using validated cut-offs. Adiposity  included  mass index (BMI), the sum of four skinfolds, and waist circumference (WC). Multilevel linear regression modeling, adjusted for age, sex and wear time, was used to assess the association between PA and SB with BMI, WC, and skinfold thickness.Total PA and different PA intensities were positively and SB was inversely associated with BMI in the total sample and in the normal- children (p < 0.05). Total PA was inversely associated with skinfold thickness in overweight and obese children (p < 0.05), while there was only a weak association for vigorous PA (p > 0.05). Moderate and moderate-to-vigorous PA were positively, and SB was negatively associated with WC in the total sample and in the normal- children (p < 0.05). Additional adjustment for potential sociocultural and biological confounding variables attenuated some of the results.In this very young and predominantly normal- population, PA is positively related to BMI and WC, but this relationship is not observed in overweight and obese children. In this latter population, PA is inversely, and SB is positively related to skinfold thickness. Skinfold thickness could represent a useful and simple clinical measure of  fat in preschoolers. The role of vigorous PA in the prevention of early childhood obesity should be further investigated in future studies.ISRCTN ISRCTN41045021 .

We performed a systematic review using the PubMed/Medline database including primary articles written in English that measured leptin production or levels as well as SCFA used as an intervention, mechanism or outcome. The search yielded a total of 573 citations; 36 studies were included in the final analysis. The quality of the studies was analyzed through two validated tools based on objective criteria. Overall, the studies presented low risk of bias to construct and statistical validity. However, the majority presented a high risk of attrition and detection bias. In vitro studies (n = 8) consistently demonstrated that SCFA stimulate leptin expression in adipocytes through activation of free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3). In animal studies (n = 24), interventions to modulate high-fat diet outcomes predominantly caused a decrease in circulating leptin levels and increased SCFA, associated with suppressed  gain. Control of dysbiosis through administration of prebiotics and probiotics also played a role in leptin synthesis in animal studies. In human studies (n = 4) leptin was mainly correlated with adiposity but dysbiosis interfered with this relationship. We conclude that the association between SCFA and leptin remains incompletely understood but occurs mainly through the activation of FFAR3 in adipocytes. However,  fat rather than SCFA remains the main driver for leptin synthesis in vivo. Future studies should aim to better clarify the role of SCFA in regulating leptin production in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to investigate the association of preoperative/postoperative  mass index (BMI) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) with prognosis in patients with gastric cancer.We retrospectively 1868 patients with stage II/III gastric cancer treated with gastrectomy between January 2006 and December 2010. We divided the populations into 3 groups according to BMI; underweight, normal, and overweight. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to BMI (underweight, normal-, overweight). PNI was classified into low and high (cutoff value; 49.7). The association of preoperative BMI/PNI and their changes (6 months postoperatively) with clinicopathologic characteristics were evaluated.Preoperative underweight and low PNI were related to poor prognosis (log-rank p < 0.001 for both). There was a positive correlation between preoperative BMI and PNI (mean preoperative PNI: 51.13 [underweight], 53.37 [normal-], and 55.16 [overweight]; p < 0.001). Preoperative BMI and PNI were independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival along with age and TNM stage (p < 0.001 for both). BMI changes from normal- to underweight and from overweight to normal/underweight were related to poor prognosis (log-rank p = 0.021 and p = 0.013, respectively). PNI changes were related to prognosis in both the preoperative low and high PNI groups (p < 0.001 and p = 0.019, respectively).Preoperative BMI and PNI and their postoperative changes are related to prognosis in patients with stage II/III gastric cancer.

Ten Italian Simmental calves were used for the experiment and were offered 6 L of bulk whole milk/d from an open-bucket starting at day 2 from birth and through 5 weeks. Blood samples were collected at birth and weekly to assess biochemical indicators related to energy metabolism and liver function, minerals, markers of inflammation, and oxidative stress.  (BW), heart girth (HG), and solid feed intake were positively affected by aging. Calves increased solid feed intake consumption after 2 week and reached a BW gain of 28.16 kg at 5 weeks. Most of blood biomarkers were affected by age, mostly concerned the period after birth and day 1, whereas no changes were observed for haptoglobin, urea, β-hydroxybutyrate, Na, and K. The amount of milk fed to calves throughout this study contributes to the maintenance of glucose concentration over time, coupled also with a considerable amount of starter intake. Glucose levels associated to the high ADG (0.89 ± 0.09 kg/d, mean ± SEM) suggest that calves experienced a positive energy balance throughout the entire pre-weaning period. Similar levels of haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin, together with a gradual increase of albumin, reflect good liver functionality and a stable condition regarding the inflammatory status. These results suggest that blood biomarkers of Simmental calves in the pre-weaning phase vary with growing stages.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Under rare circumstances, it can transform into hormonally active disease presenting with severe Cushing syndrome. It might often produce diagnostic dilemma with difficult management issue if not thoroughly investigated and subtyped accordingly following surgery. Here, we present a 21-year-old male who initially underwent pituitary adenomectomy for presumed NFA with compressive symptoms. However, he developed recurrent and invasive macroadenoma with severe clinical as well as biochemical hypercortisolism during post-surgical follow-up. Repeat pituitary surgery was carried out urgently as there was significant optic chiasmal compression. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor tissue obtained on repeat surgery proved it to be an aggressive corticotroph adenoma. Though not cured, he showed marked clinical and biochemical improvement in the immediate postoperative period. Anticipating recurrence from the residual tumor, we referred him for cyber knife radio surgery.Pituitary NFA commonly present with compressive symptoms such as headache and blurred vision. Post-surgical development of Cushing syndrome in such a case could be either drug induced or endogenous. In the presence of recurrent pituitary tumor, ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome indicates CD. Rarely a SCA presenting initially as NFA can transform into an active corticotroph adenoma. Immunohistochemical marker for ACTH in the resected tumor confirms the diagnosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675306>Third-trimester Reference Ranges for Cerebroplacental Ratio and Pulsatility Index for Middle Cerebral Artery and Umbilical Artery in Normal-growth Singleton Fetuses in the Israeli Population.</a></h1><p>The ratio between the fetal umbilical artery pulsatility index (UA-PI) and the middle cerebral artery pulsatility index (MCA-PI) is termed the cerebroplacental ratio (CPR). The CPR represents fetal blood flow redistribution at the early stages of placental insufficiency; moreover, it has predictive value for adverse intrapartum and neonatal outcomes. However, internationally accepted reference ranges for CPR are lacking.This study sought to establish UA-PI, MCA-PI, and CPR reference ranges in low-risk, normal-growth singleton fetuses during the third trimester of pregnancy.A retrospective cohort cross-sectional study was performed in the obstetrics ultrasound unit of a university hospital in Israel. We reviewed all fetal and maternal electronic records of pregnant women referred for ultrasound assessment during the third trimester between January 2014 and January 2019. We included only singleton pregnancies with normal anatomy scans and a normal third-trimester estimated fetal . The UA-PI, MCA-PI, and CPR reference ranges were reconstructed for each of the vessels for each gestational age between 29 and 41 weeks.A total of 560 pregnancies met the inclusion criteria. Satisfactory waveforms and measurements were obtained in all cases. At least 18 women enrolled at each gestational week. The MCA-PI and CPR values showed a similar parabolic curve during the third trimester of pregnancy, with a peak value at 32 and 33 gestational weeks, respectively.

The overall frequency of intact survival was 57.9% (n=154). Gestational age thresholds for best prediction of survival was 27+6 weeks and for intact survival was 29+0 gestation. Fetal  and absent/reversed ductus venosus a-wave were the main predictors of survival in the regression model. When fetal  was substituted for fetal  z-score, ductus venosus abnormal Doppler predicted mortality and absent or reversed umbilical artery diastolic velocities predicted intact survival.This study illustrates the impact of gestational age and fetal  on perinatal outcomes in early placental insufficiency, with well-defined thresholds. Gestational age and fetal , or a combination of fetal  z-scores and fetal Doppler parameters, were the best predictors of intact survival in our sample.This work was supported by Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Ministério da Saúde, Brasil.This article is protected by copyright.

To reveal the buckling (global and local) and post-buckling behavior of different lattice morphologies, both experimental and simulation-based studies were carried out. Additionally, a variable-density lattice structure was designed and analyzed to achieve the optimal value of critical buckling load. Latticed columns were fabricated using polyamide 12 material on multi jet fusion 3D printer. The results exhibited that the buckling in lattice columns depends on the distribution of mass, second moment of inertia I, diameter and position of vertical beams, number of horizontal or inclined beams, and location and angle of the beams that support the vertical beams. The number of horizontal and inclined beams and their thickness has an inverse relation with buckling; however, this trend changes after approaching a critical point. It is revealed that vertical beams are more crucial for buckling case, when compared with horizontal or inclined beams; however, material distribution in inclined or horizontal orientation is also critical because they provide support to vertical beams to behave as a single  to bear the buckling load. The results also revealed that the critical buckling load could be increased by designing variable density cellular columns in which the beams at the outer edges of the column are thicker compared with inner beams. However, post-buckling behavior of variable density structures is brittle and local when compared with uniform density lattice structures.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674178>Role of solvation on diffusion of ions in diblock copolymers: understanding the molecular  effect through modeling.</a></h1><p>Salt-doped diblock copolymers with microphase-separated domains of both an ion conductive and a mechanically strong polymer have been extensively studied due to their potential in transport applications. Several unusual or counterintuitive trends regarding their transport properties have been observed experimentally, such as increasing ion conduction as a function of molecular . A crucial feature of these systems is the strong solvation of ions in the conducting microphase due to its higher dielectric constant. Here, we perform molecular dynamics simulations using a coarse-grained model that includes a 1/r4 potential form to represent ion solvation, allowing us to reproduce experimentally observed trends and explore their molecular underpinnings. We find that increasing ion concentration can increase or decrease ion diffusion, depending on solvation strength. We also show that the trend of increasing diffusion with molecular  becomes more dramatic as ions are solvated in one polymer block more strongly or as the ion-ion interactions get stronger. In contrast to expectations, the interfacial width or the overlap of ions with the nonconductive polymer block do not adequately explain this phenomenon; instead, local ion agglomeration best explains reduced diffusion. Interfacial sharpening, controlled by the Flory χ parameter and molecular , tends to allow ions to spread more uniformly, and this increases their diffusion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670444>Limitations of cross and multigenerational plasticity for marine invertebrates faced with global climate change.</a></h1><p>Although cross generation (CGP) and multigeneration (MGP) plasticity have been identified as mechanisms of acclimation to global change, the  of evidence indicates that parental conditioning over generations is not a panacea to rescue stress sensitivity in offspring. For many species there were no benefits of parental conditioning. Even when improved performance was observed, this waned over time within a generation or across generations and fitness declined. On the other hand, CGP and MGP studies identified resilient species with stress tolerant genotypes in wild populations and selected family lines. Several bivalves possess favourable stress tolerance and phenotypically plastic traits potentially associated with genetic adaptation to life in habitats where they routinely experience temperature and/or acidification stress. These traits will be important to help 'climate proof' shellfish ventures. Species that are naturally stress tolerant and those that naturally experience a broad range of environmental conditions are good candidates to provide insights into the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in CGP and MGP. It is challenging to conduct ecologically relevant global change experiments over the long times commensurate with the pace of changing climate. As a result, many studies present stressors in a shock-type exposure at rates much faster than projected scenarios. With more gradual stressor introduction over longer experimental durations and in context with conditions species are currently acclimatized and/or adapted to, the outcomes for sensitive species might differ. We highlight the importance to understand primordial germ cell development and the timing of gametogenesis with respect to stressor exposure. Although multigenerational exposure to global change stressors currently appears limited as a universal tool to rescue species in the face of changing climate, natural proxies of future conditions (upwelling zones, CO vents, naturally warm habitats) show that phenotypic adjustment and/or beneficial genetic selection is possible for some species, indicating complex plasticity-adaptation interactions.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669673>Targeting the cannabinoid receptor CB2 in a mouse model of l-dopa induced dyskinesia.</a></h1><p>L-dopa induced dyskinesia (LID) is a debilitating side-effect of the primary treatment used in Parkinson's disease (PD), l-dopa. Here we investigate the effect of HU-308, a cannabinoid CB2 receptor agonist, on LIDs. Utilizing a mouse model of PD and LIDs, induced by 6-OHDA and subsequent l-dopa treatment, we show that HU-308 reduced LIDs as effectively as amantadine, the current frontline treatment. Furthermore, treatment with HU-308 plus amantadine resulted in a greater anti-dyskinetic effect than maximally achieved with HU-308 alone, potentially suggesting a synergistic effect of these two treatments. Lastly, we demonstrated that treatment with HU-308 and amantadine either alone, or in combination, decreased striatal neuroinflammation, a mechanism which has been suggested to contribute to LIDs. Taken together, our results suggest pharmacological treatments with CB2 agonists merit further investigation as therapies for LIDs in PD patients. Furthermore, since CB2 receptors are thought to be primarily expressed on, and signal through, glia, our data provide  to suggestion that neuroinflammation, or more specifically, altered glial function, plays a role in development of LIDs.Copyright © 2018.

The efficacy and molecular mechanisms in the presence or absence of TML were investigated.We demonstrated that treatment with TML aqueous extract protected the mice from acute lung injury induced by LPS administration. TML significantly inhibited  loss in mice, decreased the lung wet to dry  (W/D) ratios and attenuated lung histopathological changes, such as infiltration of inflammatory cells and coagulation, pulmonary edema. Furthermore, we found that TML markedly reduced the LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), decreased nitric oxide (NO), and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and effectively ameliorated LPS-induced increased total protein, leukocyte and macrophages in BALF. In addition, TML pronouncedly suppressed the activation of the MAPKs p38-NLRP3/caspase-1 and COX2, increased the expression of p-AMPK-Nrf2, and suppressed the expression of KEAP, apoptotic-related protein as well as autophagy.These results suggested that TML ameliorated LPS-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines and reducing oxidative damage associated with the MAPKs p38-NLRP3/caspase-1 and COX2 signaling pathways, AMPK-Nrf2/KEAP signaling pathways, as well as apoptosis and autophagy.Copyright © 2019.

The present interconnected systems differ from most of the existing interconnected plants in that their equilibrium points are no longer assumed to be zero. Initially, we establish a theorem to indicate that the decentralized ETC law for the overall system can be represented by an array of optimal ETC laws for nominal subsystems. Then, to obtain these optimal ETC laws, we develop a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations arising in the discounted-cost optimal ETC problems of the nominal subsystems. Meanwhile, we only use critic networks to implement the RL-based approach and tune the critic network  vectors by using the gradient descent method and the concurrent learning technique together. With the proposed  vectors tuning rule, we are able to not only relax the persistence of the excitation condition but also ensure the critic network  vectors to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Moreover, by utilizing the Lyapunov method, we prove that the obtained decentralized ETC law can force the entire system to be stable in the sense of uniform ultimate boundedness. Finally, we validate the proposed decentralized ETC strategy through simulations of the nonlinear-interconnected systems derived from two inverted pendulums connected via a spring.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671517>The Low Prevalence of Overweight and Obesity in Czech Breastfed Infants and Young Children: An Anthropological Survey.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of overweight and obesity in a sample of children who were exclusively or predominantly breastfed for at least 6 months compared to Czech references that were constructed based on a representative sample of children, regardless of their mode of feeding. Between 2008 and 2011, a longitudinal study on the growth of breastfed infants was carried out in the Czech Republic. Forty-three GP pediatricians addressed parents at 18-month preventive examinations and collected data on the families' socio-economic conditions and the infants' feeding conditions. The children were measured (length, , and head circumference), and anthropometric measurements from 10 previous preventive examinations were obtained from the health records. Out of the collected 1775 questionnaires, 960 children were selected according to the criteria of the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study. For the purpose of this study, 799 children who were exclusively or predominantly breastfed for at least 6 months were selected. We found that the proportions of children who were classified as overweight (>90th percentile) or obese (>97th percentile) at 6, 12, and 18-month examinations were far below the proportions of the Czech references. An update of the Czech references and growth charts is highly recommended by GP pediatricians for the valid assessment of growth and nutritional status, including a screening of overweight and obesity in primary preventive health care.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668708>Diagnostic laparoscopy is more accurate than Computerized Tomography for internal hernia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.</a></h1><p>Internal hernia rate after Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) is variable (0.5%-9%).We retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent diagnostic laparoscopy for possible internal hernia after RYGB from 2009 to 2016. All internal hernia defects were closed.We performed 574 RYGB cases between 2013 and 2016, 33 diagnostic laparoscopies were performed (6 after RYGB done at our institution & 27 after RYGB done at outside institutions). Diagnostic laparoscopies after RYGB done at our institution showed internal hernia in 3/6 (50%), none at Petersen space, none had incarcerated small bowel or were converted to open. While 20/27 (74%) of diagnostic laparoscopies after RYGB done at outside institutions had an internal hernia, 18/20 (90%) at Petersen space, 15/27 (55%) had incarcerated small bowel and 3.7% needed small bowel resection or were converted to open. Our internal hernia rate after RYGB was 0.5%. Computerized Tomography (CT scan) was falsely negative in 44-50% of patients with laparoscopy after RYGB.Diagnostic laparoscopy is more accurate than CT scan in evaluating patients with abdominal pain after RYGB.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

External target analytes from hair (hair-Ex) were ultrasonically extracted with acetone, while the internal target analytes (hair-In) were obtained with further digestion and liquid-liquid extraction of washed hair. Alkaline digestion with liquid-liquid extraction under alkaline and re-acidification combination conditions was the key procedure to successfully extract both parent and metabolic compounds from hair. Both external and internal extracts were purified with gel permeation chromatography, and the parent compounds were subsequently separated from their hydroxylated metabolites with a silica solid phase extraction column prior to instrumental analysis. GC-MS-MS, GC-MS and HPLC-MS-MS were used to analyze PAHs, PBDEs and their hydroxylated metabolites, respectively. The method showed satisfactory accuracy as well as precision, and the recoveries of PBDEs, PAHs, OH-PBDEs and OH-PAHs ranged from 62%-145%, 48%-135%, 60%-146% and 60%-88%, respectively. The developed method was validated in a pilot biomonitoring campaign. All parent analytes were approximately 100% detected in both hair-In and hair-Ex, while no OH-PBDEs were detected in hair-In and hair-Ex. All OH-PAHs were approximately 100% detected in hair-In with a mean Σ10OH-PAHs concentration of 174.7 ng per g dry  (dw), and the concentration in hair-Ex was 18 times lower than that in hair-In with a relatively lower detection frequency. Both partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and Spearman correlation analysis with the concentration of analytes confirmed that the developed method performed well to distinguish the internal from external exposure to target analytes in hair.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669947>Qualitative in vitro study on the degradation of mineral complexes in vegetables.</a></h1><p>Mechanisms of degradation and absorption of mineral complexes by the human digestive system are complex and still under investigation. The elaborate matrix of vegetables, and the presence of phytates and other inhibitors make study of these mechanisms difficult. In this qualitative study, extracts from freeze-dried savoy cabbage, broccoli, kale and spinach were subjected to digestion in vitro at pH 2.0 and pH 7.5 and analysed using SEC-ICP-MS. The results suggest that low molecular  species (peak 6), related to the iron and zinc fractions, which appeared after acidic digestion in all vegetables, except in kale, were considerably reduced after digestion at pH 7.5. Low molecular  species (peak 9), related to the phosphorus fraction, were present in all vegetables, except in kale, after alkaline digestion. While cabbage, broccoli and spinach showed similar degradation patterns, kale showed a different degradation behaviour.Copyright © 2019.

Indeed, unusually slow psychomotor speed, a measure predictive of behavioural performance and health outcomes, is found with obesity and ageing, two conditions also associated with chronic inflammation. Yet whether inflammation is the mediating factor remains unclear. Here, we assessed inflammation by indexing interleukin-6 level in blood and measured psychomotor speed as well as indices of selective visual attention in young (mean = 26 years) or old (mean = 71 years) adults (N = 83) who were either lean or currently significantly overweight (mean  mass index = 22.4 and 33.8, respectively). Inflammation was positively and significantly correlated with psychomotor speed, age, and  mass index but not with attention . Using mediation analyses we show for the first time that inflammation fully accounts for the significant psychomotor slowing found in those with high BMI. Moreover, we further show that age-related psychomotor slowing is partially mediated by inflammation. These findings support the proposal that reducing inflammation may mitigate - and age-related cognitive decline and thereby improve performance on daily tasks and health outcomes more generally.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671311>Validation and application of a modified QuEChERS method for extracting neonicotinoid residues from New Zealand maize field soil reveals their persistence at nominally hazardous concentrations.</a></h1><p>The widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides is controversial due to their persistence in the environment and concern for the long-term consequences of their use. We present a simple, low-cost method for the sensitive and efficient extraction from soil of thiamethoxam, clothianidin and imidacloprid, the three neonicotinoid insecticides approved in New Zealand as seed coatings. We have validated this method by applying it to uncontaminated soil samples spiked with environmentally relevant concentrations of the three targets. Absolute recoveries were >80% with instrument detection limits <1 ng g wet soil. We also applied the method to soil samples collected from maize fields in New Zealand's North Island and found imidacloprid in 43 out of 45 samples and clothianidin in every one. Mean imidacloprid concentrations varied from 0.5 to 9.4 ng g (wet ) and clothianidin from 2.1 to 26.7 ng g (wet ). Imidacloprid concentrations exceed the New Zealand Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Exposure Limit of 1 ng g (dry ) at eight of the nine sites sampled. These results are remarkable because we have detected multiple neonicotinoid residues at every site sampled. Imidacloprid residues appear to persist at significant concentrations at five of our sites from an application at least two years previously. This is only the third study to report the presence of neonicotinoid residues in NZ's environment and the first to show that those residues are persistent in the environment at nominally hazardous concentrations.Copyright © 2019.

Adipose tissue is a vital metabolic organ in energy balance and glucose homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the role of VDR expressed on adipose tissue in the balance of energy metabolism. This study was conducted in VDR-KO mice, VDR-Tg mice and wild-type mice. Energy metabolism was determined based on the energy expenditure, oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange rate, food and water intake, and a cool room test. VDR expression in the tissues of VDR-Tg mice was assessed by western blotting. The levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, leptin, and glucose were assessed using the respective kits. Insulin resistance in the whole  was evaluated by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test. mRNA associated with energy metabolism expression in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue was examined by RT-PCR. Our results show that overexpression of VDR in adipose tissue induced an increase in , fat mass, and serum lipid levels, and a decline in energy metabolism; these changes were ameliorated by VDR-KO mice. Overexpression of VDR in the adipose tissue of VDR-Tg mice induced a state of insulin resistance, which corresponded with decreased expression of UCP1, UCP2, UCP3, CPT2 and HK in both white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue; these changes were also reversed by VDR-KO mice. Our study confirms that expression levels of VDR in adipose tissue play pivotal roles in energy balance and glycolipid metabolism by regulating adipose tissue remodeling.Copyright © 2019.

This was a randomised controlled trial included 114 women with placenta praevia (between 24 and 28 weeks). They were randomly assigned to group I (17α-OHP-C) who received weekly injection of 17α-OHP-C (250 mg/IM) till completing 37 weeks' gestation or group II (Non 17α-OHP-C). The percentage of placenta praevia patients went into PTD in the 17α-OHP-C group was significantly less in comparison to the PTD in the Non 17α-OHP-C group (∼37%  63.5%,  = .004). Furthermore, the mean gestational age was significantly longer (36.7 ± 0.7  34.9 ± 1.2 weeks,  < .000), the mean number of bleeding attacks was significantly less and the mean birth  was significantly higher (2841 ± 159  2561 ± 168 g,  < .000). In conclusion, maintenance tocolysis with intramuscular 17α-OHP-C in placenta praevia women appears beneficial in decreasing the number of bleeding attacks, the percentage of PTD and the neonatal ICU admission.IMPACT STATEMENT Over the last two decades, a large number of studies indicated that placenta praevia is a major risk factor for preterm labour and prematurity with its neonatal complications. Increasing caesarean section rates had proportionally increased the incidence of placenta praevia. Up to now, the effective and safe tocolytic agent among these patients is not established. The results of this study (prospective, randomised and controlled with calculated sample size) added a considerable support for hydroxyprogesterone caproate as an effective, safe and cheap tocolytic agent with excellent patient compliance.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the placenta in MCLR-induced significant reduction in fetal , especially the changes in placental structure and function. Pregnant mice were intraperitoneally injected with MCLR (5 or 20 μg/kg) from gestational day (GD) 13 to GD17. The results showed MCLR reduced fetal  and placenta . The histological specimens of the placentas were taken for light and electron microscopy studies. The internal space of blood vessels decreased obviously in the placental labyrinth layer of mice treated with MCLR. After the ultrastructural examination, the edema and intracytoplasmic vacuolization, dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum and corrugation of the nucleus were observed. In addition, maternal MCLR exposure caused a reduction of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD11B2) expression in placentae, a critical regulator of fetal development. Several genes of placental growth factors, such as Vegfα and Pgf and several genes of nutrient transport pumps, such as Glut1 and Pcft were depressed in placentas of MCLR-treated mice, however nutrient transporters Fatp1 and Snat4 were promoted. Moreover, significant increases in malondialdehyde (MDA) revealed the occurrence of oxidative stress caused by MCLR, which was also verified by remarkable decrease in the glutathione levels, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) as well as the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis revealed that GRP78, CHOP, XBP-1, peIF2α and pIRE1 were remarkable increased in placentas of MCLR-treated mice, indicating that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway was activated by MCLR. Furthermore, oxidative stress and ER stress consequently triggered apoptosis which contributed to the impairment of placental development. Collectively, these results suggest maternal MCLR exposure results in reduced fetal , which might be associated with ROS-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress and impairment in placental structure and function.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was an attempt to explore the potential effect of breast milk mesenchymal stem cells (Br-MSCs) as a therapeutic tool for diabetic induced reproductive dysfunction at molecular level. Forty-five adult male Sprague Dawely rats were divided into 3 groups (n = 15); control group, diabetic group, and Br-MSCs treated diabetic group. The homing ability of Br-MSCs in diabetic treated rat testicles was confirmed via semi-quantitative RT- PCR analysis of a human specific Gapdh mRNA expression level. Our result showed that type1 diabetic rats exerted an elevation in blood glucose level and a reduction in , fasting serum insulin, FSH, LH, and total testosterone levels, relative and absolute testicular , sperm count, motility, and live ratio. In addition, downregulation in the hypothalamic kisspeptin-GnRH system, HPG axis and testicular steroidogenesis compared to control group was noticed. Moreover, upregulation of testicular proinflammatory and apoptotic markers relative mRNA expression compared to control group was observed. Furthermore, a decrease in testicular tissue antioxidant activity (CAT, SOD, GSH) and an increase in lipid peroxidation (MDA) compared to control group was shown. However, Br-MSCs administration restored or even exceeded the normal physiological tone in most of these parameters to the point where a potential therapeutic role for Br-MSCs in type1diabetic induced infertility can be suggested.Copyright © 2019.

As a typical surfactant, R-6-AO not only stabilizes oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions at concentrations above its critical micelle concentration (cmc) of 0.6 mM, but also forms gel emulsions at concentrations beyond the CGC with the oil volume fraction freely adjustable between 2% and 95%. Cryo-TEM images reveal that R-6-AO molecules self-assemble into left-handed helical fibers with cross-sectional diameters of about 10 nm in pure water which can be turned to very stable hydrogels at concentrations above the CGC. Compared with traditional high internal phase emulsions, the gel emulsions stabilized by R-6-AO can be prepared with different oils such as n-dodecane, n-decane, n-octane, soybean oil, olive oil and tricaprylin, due to the tricyclic diterpene hydrophobic structure in their molecules which enable them to adopt a unique arrangement in the fibers. The intriguing properties of gel emulsions stabilized by R-6-AO are believed to be significant and helpful for the preparation of new soft materials and other applications.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Increase in  and extracellular fluid volume were significantly less after infusion B than infusions A and C, but changes in blood volume did not significantly differ between infusions. All infusions increased renal volume, with no significant differences between infusions. There was no significant difference in RABF across the infusion time course or between infusion types. Renal cortex perfusion decreased during the infusion (mean 18% decrease from baseline), with no significant difference between infusions. There was a trend for increased renal cortex diffusion (4.2% increase from baseline) for the crystalloid infusion. All infusions led to significant increases in cardiac index.A smaller volume of colloid (4% succinylated gelatin) was as effective as a larger volume of crystalloid at expanding blood volume, increasing cardiac output and changing renal function.

The synthesis of binary DOEs is based on a combination of the method of carrier spatial frequencies and binary coding with a variable fill factor. Unlike various methods of multiplication, the method of carrier spatial frequencies is characterized by great flexibility and versatility. It allows us to not only form the given field distributions in arbitrary diffraction orders, but also to give them arbitrary  ratio (energy distribution in orders). As a rule, such universality leads to the need to form a complex amplitude-phase distribution in the input plane. To avoid this, in this paper it is proposed to use binary coding with a variable level. The effect of such coding is studied in detail both theoretically and numerically. It is shown that the level variation makes it possible to change the set of the observed diffraction orders. The positions and orders of the optical vortices formed are uniquely determined by the values of the carrying spatial frequencies and the topological charges of the vortices in the basic order.

The endocytosis mechanism plays a key role in pharmacokinetics of NPs. However, the effect of endocytosis mechanism both in the blood and tissue are seldom considered in PBPK model.To investigate the biodistribution of intravenously injected pegylated AuNPs in mice and human using PBPK model considering the endocytosis mechanism both in the blood and tissue.Taking polyethylene glycol-coated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as an example, we developed a PBPK model to explore biodistribution of different size AuNPs. In the model, we considered the role of endocytosis mechanism both in the blood and tissue. In addition, the size-dependent permeability coefficient, excretion rate constant, phagocytic capacity, uptake rate, and release rate were derived from literatures. The mice PBPK model was extrapolated to the human by changing physiology parameters and the number of phagocytic cell (PCs).AuNPs were primarily distributed in the blood, liver, and spleen regardless of particle size, and almost all captured by the PCs in the liver and spleen, while few was captured in the blood. There are more organ distribution and longer circulation for smaller NPs. The 24-h accumulation of AuNPs decreased with increasing size in the most organ, while the accumulation of AuNPs showed an inverted U-shaped curve in the liver and slight U-shaped curve in the blood. The human results of model-predicted displayed a similar tendency with those in mice. Size, partition coefficients, and  were the key factors influencing the organ distribution of AuNPs.The size played an important role on the distribution and accumulation of AuNPs in various tissues. Our PBPK model was well predicted the NPs distribution in mice and human. A better understanding of these mechanisms could provide effective guides for nanomedine delivery.Copyright © 2018.

However, the risk factors associated with false-negative IGRA results in children remain unclear. Between May 2012 and January 2018, 156 culture-confirmed childhood TB patients who had received T-SPOT.TB test were included. Data, including demographic information and clinicopathological variables, were collected via questionnaires. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% CI of risk factors associated with false-negative T-SPOT.TB results. The positive rate of T-SPOT.TB test was 85.9% in childhood TB patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that younger age (≤ 9 years; OR = 4.782; 95% CI: 1.689, 13.539),  for age (-score > 0.37; OR = 4.256; 95% CI: 1.458, 12.428), and hypoproteinemia (total protein ≤ 68.4 g/L; OR = 7.131; 95% CI: 1.864, 27.271) were risk factors for false-negative T-SPOT.TB results in childhood TB. Younger age, overweight, and hypoproteinemia were found to be associated with false-negative T-SPOT.TB results in childhood TB. Health care professionals should consider these risk factors when evaluating suspected childhood TB with negative T-SPOT.TB results.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673504>Safety evaluation of calcium L-methylfolate.</a></h1><p>Calcium L-methylfolate (L-5-MTHF-Ca; CAS Number 151533-22-1) is a source of folate and an alternative to folic acid for use in human food and food supplements. The safety of L-5-MTHF-Ca was evaluated by testing for genotoxicity, subchronic and prenatal developmental toxicity. In  assays L-5-MTHF-Ca was not mutagenic and did not induce other chromosomal events. Additionally, L-5-MTHF-Ca was not genotoxic in the  micronucleus test nor did it induce DNA damage in rat liver cells. In a subchronic toxicity study, rats administered up to 400 mg/kg bw/day of L-5-MTHF-Ca  oral gavage for 13 weeks had no treatment-related mortalities, and no treatment-related effects were identified on behaviour, , food consumption, ophthalmology, haematology, or organ . No treatment-related macroscopic or histopathological findings were observed. Calcium and sodium levels increased with increasing dosage, however the slight increases were within historical control ranges and reversible after the recovery period. L-5-MTHF-Ca is neither teratogenic nor embryotoxic. Based on the results of the  and  studies, the safe use of L-5-MTHF-Ca as an ingredient in foods is supported. The no observed adverse effect level was the highest dose in the subchronic toxicity study,  400 mg/kg bw/day for male and female rats.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669004>Evaluating steady-state resting energy expenditure using indirect calorimetry in adults with overweight and obesity.</a></h1><p>Determining a period of steady state (SS) is recommended when estimating resting energy expenditure (REE) using a metabolic cart. However, this practice may be unnecessarily burdensome and time-consuming in the research setting.The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of SS criteria, and compare it to alternative approaches in adults with overweight and obesity.In this cross-sectional, ancillary analysis, participants enrolled in a bariatric (study 1; n = 13) and lifestyle (study 2; n = 51)  loss intervention were included. Indirect calorimetry was performed during baseline measurements using a metabolic cart for 25 min, including a 5-min stabilization period at the start. SS was defined as the first 5-min period with a coefficient of variation (CV) ≤10% for both VO and VCO (hereafter REE).  composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis in study 2 participants only. REE was compared against the lowest CV (REE), 5-min time intervals (REE, REE, REE, REE), 4-min and 3-min SS intervals (REE and REE), and time intervals of 6-15, 6-20 and 6-25 min (REE, REE, and REE) using repeated  ANOVA and Bland-Altman analysis to test for bias, limits of agreement and accuracy (±6% measured REE).Participants were 54 ± 13 years old, mostly women (75%) and had a BMI of 35 ± 5 kg/m. Overall, 54/63 (84%) of participants reached REE, often (47/54, 87%) within the first 10-min (6-15 min). Alternative approaches to estimating REE had a relatively low bias (-16 to 13 kcals), narrow limits of agreement and high accuracy (83-98%) when compared to REE, in particular, outperforming standard prediction equations (e.g., Mifflin St. Joer).Indirect calorimetry measurements that utilize the 5-min SS approach to estimate REE are considered the gold-standard. Under circumstances of non-SS, it appears 4-min and 3-min SS periods, or fixed time intervals of atleast 5 min are accurate and practical alternatives for estimating REE in adults with overweight and obesity. However, future trials should validate alternative methods in similar populations to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Zinc is considered to be one of the promising biomaterials with respect to biodegradation rate and biocompatibility. However, no information regarding the biodegradability and biocompatibility of topologically ordered AM porous zinc is yet available. Here, we applied powder bed fusion to fabricate porous zinc with a topologically ordered diamond structure. An integrative study was conducted on the static and dynamic biodegradation behavior (in vitro, up to 4 weeks), evolution of mechanical properties with increasing immersion time, electrochemical performance, and biocompatibility of the AM porous zinc. The specimens lost 7.8% of their  after 4 weeks of dynamic immersion in a revised simulated  fluid. The mechanisms of biodegradation were site-dependent and differed from the top of the specimens to the bottom. During the whole in vitro immersion time of 4 weeks, the elastic modulus values of the AM porous zinc (E = 700-1000 MPa) even increased and remained within the scope of those of cancellous bone. Indirect cytotoxicity revealed good cellular activity up to 72 h according to ISO 10993-5 and -12. Live-dead staining confirmed good viability of MG-63 cells cultured on the surface of the AM porous zinc. These important findings could open up unprecedented opportunities for the development of multifunctional bone substituting materials that will enable reconstruction and regeneration of critical-size load-bearing bone defects. Statement of Significance No information regarding the biodegradability and biocompatibility of topologically ordered AM porous zinc is available. We applied selective laser melting to fabricate topologically ordered porous zinc and conducted a comprehensive study on the biodegradation behavior, electrochemical performance, time-dependent mechanical properties, and biocompatibility of the scaffolds. The specimens lost 7.8% of their  after 4 weeks dynamic biodegradation while their mechanical properties surprisingly increased after 4 weeks. Indirect cytotoxicity revealed good cellular activity up to 72 h. Intimate contact between MG-63 cells and the scaffolds was also observed. These important findings could open up unprecedented opportunities for the development of multifunctional bone substituting materials that mimic bone properties and enable full regeneration of critical-size load-bearing bony defects.Copyright © 2019.

We evaluated how the clinical phenotype of patients initiating GLP-1RA changed from 2010 to 2018.This was a retrospective study conducted at six diabetes outpatient clinics in Northeast Italy. We collected data of T2D patients who initiated new GLP-1RA between 2010 and 2018. We recorded baseline characteristics, including demographics, anthropometrics, cardiovascular risk factors, glucose control, lipid profile, liver enzymes, renal function and concomitant medications. We recorded updated HbA1c and  at follow-up.There were 83,116 T2D patients from a general population of ~ 1,380,000 inhabitants. Among 6167 cases of GLP-1RA initiation, 5408 were analyzed after excluding intra-class switchers. Prescription of GLP-1RA increased exponentially, and the change in the type of GLP-1RA reflected waves of their entering the market. From 2010 to 2018, there were significant increases in baseline age, diabetes duration and prevalence of male sex, of cardiovascular disease and of insulin users. Blood pressure and cholesterol levels decreased concomitantly with increasing use of medications for the control of cardiovascular risk. Baseline average HbA1c (8.3% [67 mmol/mol]) and BMI (34 kg/m) and their improvement after GLP-1RA initiation did not change over time.Despite the early positioning of GLP-1RA in T2D treatment algorithms, GLP-1RA have been prescribed in patients with progressively more advanced disease stage and especially in the presence of cardiovascular disease. Optimization of GLP-1RA use in routine clinical practice is still needed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672034>Laparoscopic management of a migrated intragastric balloon causing mechanical small bowel obstruction: a case report and review of the literature.</a></h1><p>Intragastric balloons have been used as an invasive non-surgical treatment for obesity for over 30 years. Within the last 37 years, we have found only 27 cases reported in the literature of intestinal obstruction caused by a migrated intragastric balloon. We report the laparoscopic management of such a case and make observations from similar case presentations published in the literature. A 26-year-old woman had an intragastric balloon placed endoscopically for  control 13 months previously. She presented to the emergency department with a four-day history of intermittent abdominal cramps and vomiting. Contrast enhanced computed tomography confirmed the presence of the intragastric balloon within the small bowel. At laparoscopic retrieval, the deflated intragastric balloon was found impacted in the terminal ileum approximately 15 cm from the ileocaecal valve. The balloon was retrieved by enterotomy and primary closure of the ileum without event. The risk of balloon deflation and subsequent migration increases over time but several published cases demonstrate that this complication can occur within six months of insertion. The initial approach to the treatment of migrated intragastric balloons causing small bowel obstruction should be determined by the location of impaction, severity of obstruction and the available skill set of the attending radiologist, endoscopist and/or surgeon. Balloons causing obstruction in the duodenum are likely amenable to endoscopic retrieval whereas impaction within the jejunum or ileum could be managed by percutaneous needle aspiration (in selected cases), endoscopy (double-balloon enteroscopy), laparoscopy or open surgery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670627>Burden and health state utility values of eating disorders: results from a population-based survey.</a></h1><p>There are no published estimates of the health state utility values (HSUVs) for a broad range of eating disorders (EDs). HSUVs are used in economic evaluations to determine quality-adjusted life years or as a measure of disorder burden. The main objective of the current study is to present HSUVs for a broad range of EDs based on DSM-5 diagnoses.We used pooled data of two Health Omnibus Surveys (2015 and 2016) including representative samples of individuals aged 15 + years living in South Australia. HSUVs were derived from the SF-6D (based on the SF-12 health-related quality of life questionnaire) and analysed by ED classification, ED symptoms (frequency of binge-eating or distress associated to binge eating) and  status. Multiple linear regression models, adjusted for socio-demographics, were used to test the differences of HSUVs across ED groups.Overall, 18% of the 5609 individuals met criteria for ED threshold and subthreshold. EDs were associated with HSUV decrements, especially if they were severe disorders (compared to non-ED), binge ED: -0.16 (95% CI -0.19 to -0.13), bulimia nervosa: -0.12, (95% CI -0.16 to -0.08). There was an inverse relationship between distress related binge eating and HSUVs. HSUVs were lower among people with overweight/obese compared to those with healthy  regardless of ED diagnosis.EDs were significantly associated with lower HSUVs compared to people without such disorders. This study, therefore, provides new insights into the burden of EDs.

The second aim of our study was to assess the ability of WG, WC, prepregnancy, and gestational BMI with special reference to their cut-off points on predicting the risk of GDM in pregnant women in Turkey.A total of 261 women who underwent screening for GDM with the 75-g glucose tolerance test (GTT) between 24 and 28 gestational weeks were included. According to the 75-g oral GTT results, women were classified into two groups: the GDM group and non-GDM group. The data collected included age, parity, plasma glucose level for fasting, 1- and 2-h tests, WC, prepregnancy and gestational BMI, prepregnancy , WG during pregnancy, gestational age at birth, and birth .WC at 20-24 weeks of gestation, prepregnancy BMI, and gestational BMI had a predictive capacity for GDM. According to our results, optimal cut-off points for the best predictive value of GDM were WC of 100 cm with a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 70%, prepregnancy BMI of 25 kg/m with a sensitivity of 81.8% and specificity of 76%, and gestational BMI of 28.3 kg/m with a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 77.4%.The measurement of prepregnancy BMI, gestational BMI, and WC may be useful in predicting the risk of GDM. Pregnant women with increased prepregnancy BMI, gestational BMI, and WC measurements may be susceptible to the development of GDM.©Copyright 2019 by Turkish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology | Turkish Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology published by Galenos Publishing House.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670196>Influence of Brevibacterium linens RS16 on foliage photosynthetic and volatile emission characteristics upon heat stress in Eucalyptus grandis.</a></h1><p>Heat stress induces secondary metabolic changes in plants, channeling photosynthetic carbon and energy, away from primary metabolic processes, including, growth. Use of ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate) deaminase containing plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) in conferring heat resistance in plants and the role of PGPB, in altering net carbon assimilation, constitutive and stress volatile emissions has not been studied yet. We exposed leaves of Eucalyptus grandis inoculated and non-inoculated with PGPB Brevibacterium linens RS16 to two levels of heat stress (37 °C and 41 °C for 5 min) and quantified temporal changes in foliage photosynthetic characteristics and volatile emission rates at 0.5 h, day 1 and day 5 after the stress application. Heat stress resulted in immediate reductions in dark-adapted photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield (F/F), net assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance to water vapor (g), and enhancement of stress volatile emissions, including enhanced emissions of green leaf volatiles (GLV), mono- and sesquiterpenes, light  oxygenated volatile organic compounds (LOC), geranyl-geranyl diphosphate pathway volatiles (GGDP), saturated aldehydes, and benzenoids, with partial recovery by day 5. Changes in stress-induced volatiles were always less in leaves inoculated with B. linens RS16. However, net assimilation rate was enhanced by bacterial inoculation only in the 37 °C treatment and overall reduction of isoprene emissions was observed in bacterially-treated leaves. Principal component analysis (PCA), correlation analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) indicated that different stress applications influenced specific volatile organic compounds. In addition, changes in the expression analysis of heat shock protein 70 gene (DnaK) gene in B. linens RS16 upon exposure to higher temperatures further indicated that B. linens RS16 has developed its own heat resistance mechanism to survive under higher temperature regimes. Taken together, this study demonstrates that foliar application of ACC deaminase containing PGPB can ameliorate heat stress effects in realistic biological settings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, monitoring individual VWR performance usually requires single housing, which itself might have a negative effect on wellbeing. In consideration of the 3Rs principle, VWR behaviour was evaluated under group-housing conditions. To test the applicability for severity assessment, this readout was evaluated in a dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) induced colitis model. For continuous monitoring, an automated system with integrated radio-frequency identification technology was used, enabling detection of individual VWR. After a 14-day adaptation period mice demonstrated a stable running performance. Analysis during DSS treatment in combination with repeated facial vein phlebotomy and faecal sampling procedure resulted in significantly reduced VWR behaviour during the course of colitis and increased VWR during disease recovery. Mice submitted to phlebotomy and faecal sampling but no DSS treatment showed less reduced VWR but a longer-lasting recovery. Application of a cluster model discriminating individual severity levels based on VWR and  data revealed the highest severity level in most of the DSS-treated mice on day 7, but a considerable number of control mice also showed elevated severity levels due to sampling procedures alone. In summary, VWR sensitively indicated the course of DSS colitis severity and the impact of sample collection. Therefore, monitoring of VWR is a suitable method for the detection of disturbed wellbeing due to DSS colitis and sampling procedure in group-housed female laboratory mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670237>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of knee joint under mechanical loading: Review.</a></h1><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a very common disease that affects the human knee joint, particularly the articular cartilage and meniscus components which are regularly under compressive mechanical loads. Early-stage OA diagnosis is essential as it allows for timely intervention. The primary non-invasive approaches currently available for OA diagnosis include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which provides excellent soft tissue contrast at high spatial resolution. MRI-based knee investigation is usually performed on joints at rest or in a non--bearing condition that does not mimic the actual physiological condition of the joint. This discrepancy may lead to missed detections of early-stage OA or of minor lesions. The mechanical properties of degenerated musculoskeletal (MSK) tissues may vary markedly before any significant morphological or structural changes detectable by MRI. Recognizing distinct deformation characteristics of these tissues under known mechanical loads may reveal crucial joint lesions or mechanical malfunctions which result from early-stage OA. This review article summarizes the large number of MRI-based investigations on knee joints under mechanical loading which have been reported in the literature including the corresponding MRI , the MRI-compatible devices employed, and potential challenges due to the limitations of clinical MRI sequences.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

BMI z scores were calculated, student obesity or obesity/overweight was determined using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts, and these data were combined with the locations of four food outlet types (fast-food restaurants, wait-service restaurants, corner stores, and supermarkets) to calculate distance to the nearest outlet. Associations between  status outcomes and distance to these food outlet types were examined using neighborhood (census tract) fixed effects.Living farther than 0.025 mile (about half of a city block) from the nearest fast-food restaurant was associated with lower obesity and obesity/overweight risk and lower BMI z scores. Results ranged from 2.5% to 4.4% decreased obesity. Beyond this distance, there were generally no impacts of the food environment and little to no impact of other food outlet types.Proximity to fast-food restaurants was inversely related to childhood obesity, but no relationships beyond that were seen. These findings can help better inform policies focused on food access, which could, in turn, reduce childhood obesity.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673500>Multiple organ toxicity of  seed extracts.</a></h1><p> seed ranks top among major plants commonly abused as drug in Nigeria. The present study therefore sought to unravel the target organs of toxicity as well as underscore the role of extraction solvent in the toxicity of  seed. Twenty male Wistar rats were randomly placed into four groups (I-IV) of five animals per group. Group I served as the control and was administered with distilled water only, while groups II, III and IV animals received 50 mg/kg  of aqueous, methanolic and diethylether extracts of  seeds by oral gavage for 14 days. Specific biomarkers of toxicity such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lipid peroxidation (MDA) were estimated in the liver, brain, kidney and heart homogenates as well as serum of experimental animals. Lipid profile and activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide (SOD) and catalase were determined in selected tissues while creatinine and urea were estimated in the kidney and serum. Results indicated that  seed extract generally caused a significant decrease in ALT, AST, ALP and MDA in selected tissue homogenates while these parameters increased significantly in the serum relative to the control group. Lipid profile was significantly deranged across selected tissues while SOD and catalase activity were significantly decreased relative to control. Put together, toxicity of  seed extract is diverse depending on the organ involved and solvent used for its extraction. Therefore, illicit use of  seeds as drugs among young people should be discouraged.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671316>Integrated thyroid endocrine disrupting effect on zebrafish (Danio rario) larvae via simultaneously repressing type II iodothyronine deiodinase and activating thyroid receptor-mediated signaling following waterborne exposure to trace azocyclotin.</a></h1><p>As a widely used organotin acaricide nowadays, azocyclotin (ACT) could induce thyroidal endocrine disruption in fishes and amphibians, but its dominant disrupting mode remains unknown. In this study, zebrafish were firstly exposed to ACT (0.18-0.36 ng/mL) from 2 hpf (hours post fertilization) to 30 dpf (days post fertilization), and a series of developmental toxicological endpoints and thyroid hormones were measured. Result showed that no developmental toxicity to zebrafish was found in 0.18 and 0.24 ng/mL groups except decreased  (30 dpf, 0.24 ng/mL). However, exposed to 0.36 ng/mL ACT led to reductions in heartbeat (48 hpf), hatching rate (72 hpf) and bodyweight (30 dpf). General tendencies of decreases in free T3 but increases in free T4 and reductions in ratio of free T3/T4 were also found, inferring that type II deiodinase (Dio2) was repressed. This inference was confirmed by Western analysis that Dio2 expression reduced by 42.7% after 0.36 ng/mL ACT treatment. Moreover, RNA-Seq analysis implied that exposed to 0.36 ng/mL ACT altered the genome-wide gene expression profiles of zebrafish. Totally 5660 genes (involving 3154 down-regulated and 2596 up-regulated genes) were differentially expressed, and 13 deferentially expressed genes including down-regulated dio2 were significantly enriched in thyroid hormone signaling pathway. Subsequently, an in vitro thyroid receptor-reporter gene assay using GH3 cells was performed to further explore the potential disrupting mechanism. Result showed that luciferase activity slightly increased after exposure to ACT alone or ACT combined with low level T3, but was suppressed when combined with high level T3. It indicted there probably existed a competitive relationship in some extent between ACT and T3 in vivo. Overall, the present study provided preliminary evidences that long-term exposure to trace ACT repressed Dio2 expression, declined T3 and then activated thyroid receptor-mediated signaling, thereby leading to integrated thyroid endocrine disruption in zebrafish larvae.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Routine pregnancy care based on maternal abdominal palpation fails to detect the majority of non-cephalic presentations.To report the incidence of non-cephalic presentation at a routine scan at 35 - 36 weeks' gestation and subsequent management of such pregnancies.This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in 45,847 singleton pregnancies that had undergone routine ultrasound examination at 35 - 36 weeks' gestation. Patients with breech or transverse / oblique presentation were divided into two groups, first those that would have elective cesarean section for fetal or maternal indications other than the abnormal presentation, and second, those that would potentially require ECV. The latter group was reassessed in 1-2 weeks and if there was persistence of the abnormal presentation the parents were offered the options of ECV versus elective cesarean section at 38-40 weeks' gestation. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine which of the factors from maternal and pregnancy characteristics provided a significant contribution in the prediction of first, non-cephalic presentation at the 35 - 36 weeks scan, second, successful ECV from non-cephalic to cephalic presentation, and third, spontaneous rotation from non-cephalic to cephalic presentation.First, at 35 - 36 weeks the fetal presentation was cephalic in 43,416 (94.7%) pregnancies, breech in 1,987 (4.3%) and transverse or oblique in 444 (1.0%). Second, multivariable analysis demonstrated that the chance of non-cephalic presentation increased with increasing maternal age and , decreasing height, earlier gestational age at scan, and it was higher in the presence of placenta previa, oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios, in nulliparous than parous women and lower in women of South Asian and mixed racial origin than in White women. Third, 22% of cases of non-cephalic presentation were not eligible for ECV because of planned cesarean section for indications other than the malpresentation. Fourth, of those eligible for ECV only 48.5% (646/1,332) accepted the procedure and this was successful in 39.0% (252/646) of cases. Fifth, the chance of successful ECV increased with increasing maternal age and was lower in nulliparous than parous women. Sixth, in 33.9% (738/2,179) of pregnancies with non-cephalic presentation where successful ECV was not carried out there was a subsequent spontaneous rotation to cephalic presentation. Seventh, the chance of spontaneous rotation from non-cephalic to cephalic presentation increased with increasing interval between the scan and delivery and decreased with increasing birth , it was higher in women of Black than White racial origin, if the presentation was transverse or oblique than breech and if there was polyhydramnios and lower in nulliparous than parous women and in the presence of placenta previa. Eighth, in 109 (0.3%) of cephalic presentations there was subsequent rotation to non-cephalic presentation and in 41% of these the diagnosis was made during labor. Ninth, in the total of 2,431 cases of non-cephalic presentation at the time of the scan the presentation at birth was cephalic in 985 (40.5%); in 738 (74.9%) this was due to spontaneous rotation and in 247 (25.1%) due to successful ECV. Tenth, prediction of non-cephalic presentation at the 35 - 36 weeks scan and successful ECV from maternal and pregnancy factors was poor, but prediction of spontaneous rotation from non-cephalic to cephalic presentation was moderately good and this could be incorporated in the counselling of women prior to undertaking ECV.The problem of unexpected non-cephalic presentation in labor can to a great extent be overcome by a routine ultrasound examination at 35 - 36 weeks' gestation. The incidence of non-cephalic presentation at the 35 - 36 weeks scan was about 5%, but, in about 40% of these cases the presentation at birth was cephalic, mainly due to subsequent spontaneous rotation and to a lesser extent as a consequence of successful ECV.

This study compares the incidence and degree of cholestasis between infants with IF receiving SMOF or IL.Infants with IF receiving SMOF or IL during the first 8 weeks of parenteral nutrition (PN) support between 2014 and 2017 were reviewed. Clinical characteristics, cholestasis incidence (conjugated bilirubin (Cbili) >2 mg/dL for >2 weeks), and nutritional parameters were compared using Welch's t-test.91% (21/23) of IL and 76% (16/21) of SMOF babies became cholestatic (p = 0.18). There was no significant difference in median peak Cbili, but SMOF babies normalized more quickly (p = 0.04). Median z-scores for  were similar throughout the study. SMOF patients getting full PN had a lower incidence of cholestasis compared to IL patients (78% vs. 92%, p = 0.057), but those with cholestasis had similar peak Cbili, time to resolution, and growth.Early use of Smoflipid® did not reduce the incidence of cholestasis compared to Intralipid® in infants with IF, but hyperbilirubinemia did resolve more quickly. SMOF may be most beneficial for infants tolerating no enteral nutrition.Level III Retrospective Comparative Treatment Study.Retrospective Review.Copyright © 2019.

We have shown that glucagon-receptor (GCGR) signaling increases fatty acid oxidation (FAOx) in primary hepatocytes and reduces liver triglycerides in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice; however, the mechanisms underlying this aspect of GCG biology remains unclear. Investigation of hepatic GCGR targets elucidated a potent and previously unknown induction of leptin receptor (Lepr) expression. Liver leptin signaling is known to increase FAOx and decrease liver triglycerides, similar to glucagon action. Therefore, we hypothesized that glucagon increases hepatic LEPR, which is necessary for glucagon-mediated reversal of hepatic steatosis. Eight week-old control and liver-specific, LEPR-deficient mice (LeprΔliver) were placed on a high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and then treated with a selective GCGR agonist (IUB288) for 14 days. Liver triglycerides and gene expression were assessed in liver tissue homogenates. Administration of IUB288 in both lean and DIO mice increased hepatic Lepr isoforms a-e in acute (4h) and chronic (72h,16d) (p<0.05) settings. LeprΔliver mice displayed increased hepatic triglycerides on a chow diet alone (p<0.05), which persisted in a DIO state (p<0.001), with no differences in  or composition. Surprisingly, chronic administration of IUB288 in DIO control and LeprΔliver mice reduced liver triglycerides regardless of genotype (p<0.05). Together these data suggest that GCGR activation induces hepatic Lepr expression and although hepatic glucagon and leptin signaling have similar liver lipid targets, these appear to be two distinct pathways.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Anthropometry measurements were conducted on the index child at birth and approximately 1 and 2 years of age. A directed acyclic graph was used to identify minimal sufficient adjustment sets. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPY), a metabolite of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos methyl, and 4-nitrophenol, a metabolite of parathion and methyl parathion, were detected in nearly all women with geometric mean (95% CI) values of 3.17 (2.82-3.56) and 18.66 (17.03-20.46) µg/g creatinine, respectively. 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a non-specific metabolite of several pyrethroids, and 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine (IMPY), a diazinon metabolite, were detected in 19.8% and 16.1% of women, respectively. The remaining four pesticide biomarkers were detected in <10% of women. Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were more than 3 times more likely to deliver preterm than women in the lowest quartile: unadjusted RR (95% CI), 3.57 (1.65, 7.73). Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were also at increased risk of having a child born small for gestational age: RR (95% CI) adjusted for household income, maternal education, and maternal total energy and meat intake, 3.81 (1.10, 13.21). Women with detectable concentrations of IMPY were at increased risk of having a child born with low birth  compared to women with non-detectable concentrations: adjusted RR (95% CI), 2.13 (1.12, 4.08). We observed no association between any of the pesticide biomarkers and stunting at 1 or 2 years of age.Exposure to the insecticides parathion and diazinon during early pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

These studies consume quantities of limited material and, with higher concentrated therapeutics, more material is needed. Here, we evaluate the use of crystal zenith (CZ) microtiter plates in conjunction with FluoroTec coated butyl rubber mats as a small volume, high-throughput system for formulation stability studies. The system was studied for evaporation, edge effects, and stability with comparisons to type 1 glass and CZ vials for multiple antibodies and formulations. Evaporation was minimal at 4°C and could be reduced at elevated temperatures using sealed, mylar bags. Edge effects were not observed until 12 weeks at 40°C. The overall stability ranking as measured by the rate of change in high molecular  and percent main peak species were comparable across both vials and plates at 4 and 40°C out to 12 weeks. Product quality attributes as measured by the multi-attribute method were also comparable across all containers for each molecule-formulation. A potential difference was measured for subvisible particle analysis, with the plates measuring lower particle counts than the vials. Overall, CZ plates are a viable alternative to traditional vials for small volume, high-throughput formulation stability screening studies.Copyright © 2019.

Besides its metabolic positive effects, Metformin has direct effects on inflammation and can have immunomodulatory and antineoplastic properties.The aim of this narrative review was to summarize the up-to-date evidence from the current literature about the metabolic and non-metabolic effects of Metformin.We reviewed the current literature dealing with different effects and properties of Metformin and current recommendations about the use of this drug. We identified keywords and MeSH terms in Pubmed and the terms Metformin and type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, pregnancy, heart failure, PCOS, etc, were searched, selecting only significant original articles and review in English, in particular of the last five years.Even if many new effective hypoglycemic agents have been launched in the market in the last few years, Metformin would always keep a place in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and its comorbidities because of its multiple positive effects and low cost.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673891>Benefits and risks of low molecular  heparin in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</a></h1><p>Low molecular  heparin (LMWH) is an anticoagulant that has recently been found benefit in the acute exacerbation stage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). But its efficacy is controversial. The objective of this paper is to compare the harm/benefit of LMWH combined with conventional therapy versus single conventional therapy in the acute exacerbation stage of COPD.PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, and Clinical Trials.gov were searched from inception until March 2019. Randomized control trials were included if they reported the use of LMWH for the treatment of COPD. Continuous variable data were reported as mean difference (MD), risk difference (RD), and Peto odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% CIs.Twelve RCTs (N = 1086 subjects) were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled results exhibited that LMWH treatment significantly improved the levels of arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO) (MD = 4.58, 95% CI: 1.78-7.39, P = 0.001), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (MD = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.09-0.29, P = 0.0002), and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) (MD = 10.44, 95% CI: 5.40-15.48, P < 0.0001), and significantly reduced the risk of thrombosis (RD, - 0.03; 95% CI, - 0.07 to 0.00; P = 0.05). There was a marginally but nonsignificant improvement in PaCO levels vs non-LMWH treatment. Moreover, pooled results exhibited that LMWH may increase the risk of hemorrhage. Subgroup analyses exhibited that LMWH treatment only was associated with a significantly increased risk of minor bleeding but not major hemorrhage.When compared with single conventional therapy, addition of LMWH to conventional therapy may provide more clinical benefits in the acute exacerbation stage of COPD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671710>Effects of Gellan Oligosaccharide and NaCl Stress on Growth, Photosynthetic Pigments, Mineral Composition, Antioxidant Capacity and Antimicrobial Activity in Red Perilla.</a></h1><p>The growing market demand for plant raw materials with improved biological value promotes the extensive search for new elicitors and biostimulants. Gellan gum derivatives may enhance plant growth and development, but have never been used under stress conditions. Perilla ( , Lamiaceae) is a source of valuable bioproducts for the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries. However, there is not much information on the use of biostimulators in perilla cultivation. In this work we investigated the effects of oligo-gellan and salt (100 mM NaCl) on the yield and quality of red perilla (  var.  f. ) leaves. Plants grown under stress showed inhibited growth, smaller biomass, their leaves contained less nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, total polyphenol and total anthocyanins, and accumulated considerably more sodium than control plants. Treatment with oligo-gellan under non-saline conditions stimulated plant growth and the fresh  content of the above-ground parts, enhanced the accumulation of nitrogen, potassium, magnesium and total polyphenols, and increased antioxidant activity as assessed by DPPH and ABTS assays. Oligo-gellan applied under saline conditions clearly alleviated the stress effects by limiting the loss of biomass, macronutrients, and total polyphenols. Additionally, plants pretreated with oligo-gellan and then exposed to 100 mM NaCl accumulated less sodium, produced greater amounts of photosynthetic pigments, and had greater antioxidant activity than NaCl-stressed plants. Irrespective of the experimental treatment, 50% extract effectively inhibited growth of  and . Both microorganisms were the least affected by 25% extract obtained from plants untreated with either NaCl or oligo-gellan. In conclusion, oligo-gellan promoted plant growth and enhanced the quality of red perilla leaves and efficiently alleviated the negative effects of salt stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672219>Increasing heart transplant donor pool by liberalization of size matching.</a></h1><p>The heart transplant (HT) guidelines recommendation to match recipient and donors within 30% of  lacks a strong evidence base and is not well established in patients bridged to transplant with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD). In light of the scarcity of donor hearts, we investigated the effect of size mismatch on hemodynamics, one-year survival and length of stay (LOS) following HT.Single-center retrospective analysis of consecutive HT patients from April 2007 to September 2017. Recipients were divided into 3 cohorts based on donor-to-recipient  ratio (DRWR): (1) undersized (<0.7), (2) size-matched, (0.7-1.3); (3) oversized (>1.3).288 consecutive patients were identified (mean age 53 ± 11 years; 76% male), 46 were undersized (0.61 ± 0.05), 210 size-matched (0.94 ± 0.16), and 32 oversized (1.65 ± 0.38). There was no significant difference in donor left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) between the 3 groups (p = 0.11). The donor/recipient (D/R) predicted heart mass (PHM) was lowest in the undersized group (0.92 ± 0.13). There were no significant differences in 1-year survival in the overall and LVAD cohort (p = 0.65 and 0.59, respectively). Neither donor LVEDD nor D/R PHM differed among survivors or non-survivors. LOS was longer in the undersized group than the size-matched cohort (p = 0.004). The undersized group had hearts with the highest filling pressures and lowest cardiac index at 1 week among the remaining groups (p = 0.009, 0.017, and p = 0.05, respectively). There were no clinically significant differences in hemodynamics at 1 or 6 months.HT undersizing affects hemodynamics early but not later in the course and does not impact 1-year survival. The liberalization of size matching may increase the HT donor pool significantly.Copyright © 2019.

We built a separate logistic regression model for each marker to model the composite outcome as function of the specific marker, planned delivery mode, and marker-by-planned-delivery-mode-interaction, and furthermore performed multivariable logistic regression with backward variable elimination separately in each trial arm. Markers considered were maternal age, parity, history of previous CD, use of antenatal corticosteroids, estimated fetal  (EFW) of twin A, EFW of twin B, >25% difference in EFW of the twins, presentation of twin B, chorionicity on ultrasound, method of conception, complications of pregnancy, ruptured membranes at randomization and GA at randomization. The main outcome measure was a composite adverse perinatal outcome (perinatal death or serious neonatal morbidity).None of the studied baseline markers was associated with differential benefit from planned CD. GA at delivery was differentially associated with the outcome in the treatment arms (p for interaction 0.001). GA at delivery was differentially associated with the outcome in the treatment arms (p for interaction 0.001). For GA 32+0- 36+6 weeks, VD was associated with fewer adverse outcomes compared to CD (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.37-1.03). At ≥ 37+0 weeks, 10 (1%) newborns suffered the composite perinatal outcome after planned CD versus 23 (2%) after planned VD (OR 2.25; 95% CI 1.06-4.77).Neonatal outcomes of twin pregnancies with the first twin in cephalic position may differ depending on GA and planned mode of delivery. From 32-37 weeks a planned VD seems favorable, while from around 37 weeks on, a CD might be safer. The absolute risks at term are low and must be weighed against the increased maternal risks associated with planned CD.

Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term (5 weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes affects metabolites, lipid and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for 5 weeks. Metabolites, fatty acids, lipid-lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for  loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total lipid concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially -loss related. Tyrosine levels were reduced and behenic acid levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type 2 diabetes with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in lipid-lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) has been reported to decrease dietary protein levels, promote intestinal health in piglets and reduce environmental pollution. However, the underlying mechanisms of AKG are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of low-protein diet supplementation of AKG on the growth performance, nitrogen metabolism, relative expression of amino acid transporter genes and mTOR signalling pathway of skeletal muscle in piglets. Forty-eight piglets with an initial  of 11.53 ± 0.04 kg were randomly divided into four groups. Each group had four replicates, and each replicate had three pigs. A low-protein (LP) diet (crude protein was 14.96%) served as the control without AKG, while 0.5%, 1.0% and 1.5% AKG were added to the LP diet for the other experimental groups. The trial period lasted for 28 days. Compared with the LP group, the LP + 1.0%A and LP + 1.5%A groups increased the growth performance (p < .05);increased the mRNA levels of amino acid transporters in the duodenum, anterior jejunum and posterior jejunum (p < .05); and reduced faecal nitrogen and urine nitrogen emissions (p < .05). They also showed greater mRNA levels and phosphorylated protein levels for S6 kinase beta (S6K) (p < .05), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (p < .05) and 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) (p < .05) in skeletal muscle. An LP diet supplemented with AKG activated the mTOR signalling and promoted the ability of the small intestine to absorb protein, thereby increasing protein deposition. Taken together, an LP diet supplemented with AKG provides a theoretical basis for the promotion and application of AKG in piglet production.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670396>Screening for small-for-gestational-age fetuses.</a></h1><p>It is well established that correct antenatal identification of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetuses reduces their risk of adverse perinatal outcome with long-term consequences. Ultrasound estimates of fetal  (EFW ) is the ultimate tool for this identification. It can be conducted as a "universal screening", ie all pregnant women at a specific gestational age. However, in Denmark it is conducted as "selective screening", ie only on clinical indication. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of the Danish national SGA screening program and the consequences of false positive and false negative SGA cases.In this retrospective cohort study, we included 2928 women with singleton pregnancies with due date in 2015. We defined "risk of SGA" by an EFW ≤ -15% of expected for the gestational age and "SGA" as birthweight ≤ -22% of expected for gestational age.At birth, the prevalence of SGA was 3.3%. The overall sensitivity of the Danish screening program was 62% at a false-positive rate of 5.6%. Within the entire cohort, 63% had an EFW as compared to 79% of the SGA-cases. The sensitivity was 79% for those born before 37 weeks' gestation but only 40% for those born after 40 weeks' gestation. The sensitivity was also associated to birthweight deviation; 73% among extreme SGA cases (birthweight deviation ≤ -33%) and 55% among mild SGA (birthweight deviation between -22% and 27%). False diagnosis of SGA was associated with an increased rate of induction of labor (OR = 2.51, 95% CI; 1.70 to 3.71) and cesarean section (OR = 1.44, 95% CI; 0.96 to 2.18).The performance of the Danish national screening program for SGA based on selective EFW on clinical indication have improved considerably over the last 20 years. Limitations of the program are the large proportion of women referred to ultrasound scan and the low performance post-term.© 2019 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675563>Combining species sensitivity distribution (SSD) model and thermodynamic index (exergy) for system-level ecological risk assessment of contaminates in aquatic ecosystems.</a></h1><p>After reviewing the species- and community-level ecological risk assessments (ERAs) of chemicals in the aquatic environment, the present study attempted to propose a third stage of ERA, i.e., the ecosystem-level ERA. Based on the species sensitivity distribution model (SSD) and thermodynamic theory, the exergy and biomass indicators of communities from various trophic levels (TLs) were introduced to improve ecological connotation of SSDs. The species were classified into three TLs based on algae (TL1), invertebrates (TL2), and vertebrates (TL3), and the  of each TL was determined based on relative biomass and β value, which indicated a holistic contribution of each species or community to the ecosystem. Then, a system-level ERA protocol was successfully established, and the community- and system-level ecological risks of 10 typical toxic micro-organic pollutants in the western area of Lake Chaohu and its inflowing rivers were evaluated. System-level ERA curves (ExSSD) were mainly affected by the community-level SSD at TL2 for most chemicals in the present study. The uncertain boundary of ExSSD was mostly related to TLs with a wider uncertain boundary, but had little relation to the  of each TL. The results of system-level ERAs revealed that dibutyl phthalate had the highest eco-risk, whereas γ-hexachlorocyclohexane presented the lowest eco-risk. Results of the system-level ERA were not fully consistent with the those of community-level ERA owing to the lack of a sufficient dataset, SSD model type, and ecosystem structure, as indicated by the  of each TL. The successful application of ExSSD in Lake Chaohu signifies the start of the third stage of ERA at the system-level, and it also provides a scientific basis for ecosystem-level ERA, aquatic ecosystem protection, and future water safety management. However, there were some limitations, including sufficient data dependence, neglect of ecological interactions, and neglect of environmental parameters such as natural organic matter. We propose to employ toxicogenomics to enrich the toxicity database, to simulate the interaction using the ecological dynamic model, and to introduce the chemical fate model into the system-level ERA.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.
