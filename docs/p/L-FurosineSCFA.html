This experiment quantified food intake, body weight and body composition responses to three different soluble fermentable dietary fibres in an animal model and explored underlying mechanisms of satiety signalling and hindgut fermentation.Young adult male rats were fed ad libitum purified control diet (CONT) containing 5% w/w cellulose (insoluble fibre), or diet containing 10% w/w cellulose (CELL), fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS), oat beta-glucan (GLUC) or apple pectin (PECT) (4 weeks; n = 10/group). Food intake, body weight, and body composition (MRI) were recorded, final blood samples analysed for gut satiety hormones, hindgut contents for fermentation products (including short-chain  , ) and intestinal tissues for  receptor gene expression.GLUC, FOS and PECT groups had, respectively, 10% (P < 0.05), 17% (P < 0.001) and 19% (P < 0.001) lower food intake and 37% (P < 0.01), 37% (P < 0.01) and 45% (P < 0.001) lower body weight gain than CONT during the four-week experiment. At the end they had 26% (P < 0.05), 35% (P < 0.01) and 42% (P < 0.001) less total body fat, respectively, while plasma total glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) was 2.2-, 3.2- and 2.6-fold higher (P < 0.001) and peptide   (PYY) was 2.3-, 3.1- and 3.0-fold higher (P < 0.001). There were no differences in these parameters between CONT and CELL. Compared with CONT and CELL, caecal concentrations of fermentation products increased 1.4- to 2.2-fold in GLUC, FOS and PECT (P < 0.05) and colonic concentrations increased 1.9- to 2.5-fold in GLUC and FOS (P < 0.05), with no consistent changes in  receptor gene expression detected.This provides animal model evidence that sustained intake of three different soluble dietary fibres decreases food intake, weight gain and adiposity, increases circulating satiety hormones GLP-1 and PYY, and increases hindgut fermentation. The presence of soluble fermentable fibre appears to be more important than its source. The results suggest that dietary fibre-induced satiety is worthy of further investigation towards natural body weight regulation in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25150199>Valproic acid increases NO production via the SH-PTP1-CDK5-eNOS-Ser(116) signaling cascade in endothelial cells and mice.</a></h1><p>Valproic acid (VPA) with its inhibitory activity of histone deacetylase has been used in the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder associated with cerebrovascular dysfunction. Because nitric oxide (NO) produced by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) plays a role in the maintenance of vascular function, NO is likely to mediate VPA׳s drug effect, but its effect on NO production remains controversial. We investigated whether and how VPA regulates NO production in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) and mice. VPA increased NO production in BAECs, which was accompanied by a decrease in phosphorylation of eNOS at serine 116 (eNOS-Ser(116)) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 at  15 (CDK5-Tyr(15)). Ectopic expression of p25, a CDK5 activator, restored the VPA-inhibited eNOS-Ser(116) phosphorylation. In silico analysis revealed that the CDK5-Tyr(15) residue might be a substrate for SH2 domain-containing protein  phosphatase 1 (SH-PTP1), and CDK5 actually interacted with SH-PTP1. VPA increased SH-PTP1 expression and its activity. Stibogluconate, a specific SH-PTP1 inhibitor, reversed the VPA-inhibited phosphorylation of CDK5-Tyr(15) and eNOS-Ser(116). Knockdown of SH-PTP1 using small interfering RNA also reversed all the observed effects of VPA. Finally, both serum NO level and acetylcholine-induced aortic relaxation increased in VPA-medicated male mice. These increases were accompanied by increased SH-PTP1 expression and decreased phosphorylation of CDK5-Tyr(15) and eNOS-Ser(116) in mouse aortas. In conclusion, VPA increases NO production by inhibiting the CDK5-Tyr(15)-eNOS-Ser(116) phosphorylation axis; this process is mediated by SH-PTP1. VPA may be useful in the treatment of NO-related cerebrocardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

However, the degree to which testosterone levels and sperm quality are decreased under VPA treatment needs to be clarified. The aim of the present study was to investigate the testicular proteins involved in testosterone synthesis and spermatogenesis, histopathology and sperm acrosome status in VPA-treated rats. Adult rats were divided into control and experimental groups (n=8 in each). Rats in the experimental group were treated with 500mg kg, i.p., VPA for 10 consecutive days. Expression of Ki-67,  phosphorylated proteins and testicular steroidogenic proteins was examined. As expected, VPA-treated rats exhibited adverse changes in almost all reproductive parameters, particularly an increase in precocious acrosome reactions, compared with the control group. In addition, fibrosis of the tunica albuginea and tubule basement membrane was observed in testes from VPA-treated rats. Moreover, the expression of testicular Ki-67, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) and phosphorylated proteins (41, 51 and 83 kDa) was decreased significantly in VPA-treated rats compared with control. In contrast, the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory proteins in the VPA-treated group was significantly higher than in the control group. In conclusion, VPA treatment changes the expression of testicular proteins responsible for spermatogenesis and testosterone production, resulting in male infertility.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26854204>Lysophosphatidic acid activates Arf6 to promote the mesenchymal malignancy of renal cancer.</a></h1><p>Acquisition of mesenchymal properties by cancer cells is critical for their malignant behaviour, but regulators of the mesenchymal molecular machinery and how it is activated remain elusive. Here we show that clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) frequently utilize the Arf6-based mesenchymal pathway to promote invasion and metastasis, similar to breast cancers. In breast cancer cells, ligand-activated receptor  kinases employ GEP100 to activate Arf6, which then recruits AMAP1; and AMAP1 then binds to the mesenchymal-specific protein EPB41L5, which promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and focal adhesion dynamics. In renal cancer cells, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) activates Arf6 via its G-protein-coupled receptors, in which GTP-Gα12 binds to EFA6. The Arf6-based pathway may also contribute to drug resistance. Our results identify a specific mesenchymal molecular machinery of primary ccRCCs, which is triggered by a product of autotaxin and it is associated with poor outcome of patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890173>Precise tuning of the glyoxylate cycle in Escherichia coli for efficient  production from acetate.</a></h1><p>Acetate is one of promising feedstocks owing to its cheap price and great abundance. Considering that  production is gradually shifting to microbial production method, its production from acetate can be attempted to further improve the economic feasibility of its production.Here, we engineered a previously reported strain, SCK1, for efficient production of  from acetate. Initially, the acetate uptake and gluconeogenic pathway were amplified to maximize the flux toward . As flux distribution between glyoxylate and TCA cycles is critical for efficient precursor supplementation, the activity of the glyoxylate cycle was precisely controlled by expression of isocitrate lyase gene under different-strength promoters. Consequently, the engineered strain with optimal flux distribution produced 0.70 g/ with 20% of the theoretical maximum yield which are 1.6-fold and 1.9-fold increased values of the parental strain. production from acetate requires precise tuning of the glyoxylate cycle and we obtained substantial improvements in production titer and yield by synthetic promoters and 5' untranslated regions (UTRs). This is the first demonstration of  production from acetate. Our strategies would be widely applicable to the production of various chemicals from acetate in future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30521668>Opposing Effects of PPARα Agonism and Antagonism on Refractive Development and Form Deprivation Myopia in Guinea Pigs.</a></h1><p>To determine if drug-induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) signal pathway modulation affects refractive development and myopia in guinea pigs.Pigmented guinea pigs were randomly divided into normal vision (unoccluded) and form deprivation myopia (FDM) groups. Each group received daily peribulbar injections of either a vehicle or (1) PPARα agonist, GW7647, clofibrate, or bezafibrate or (2) PPARα antagonist, GW6471, for 4 weeks. Baseline and posttreatment refraction and ocular biometric parameters were measured. Immunofluorescent staining of PPARα and two of its downstream readouts, cytosolic malic enzyme 1 (ME1) and apolipoproteinA II (apoA-II), was undertaken in selected scleral sections. Western blot analysis determined collagen type I expression levels.GW6471 induced a myopic shift in unoccluded eyes, but had no effect on form-deprived eyes. Conversely, GW7647 inhibited FDM progression without altering unoccluded eyes. Bezafibrate and clofibrate had effects on refraction similar to those of GW7647 in unoccluded and form-deprived eyes. GW6471 downregulated collagen type I expression in unoccluded eyes whereas bezafibrate inhibited collagen type I decreases in form-deprived eyes. GW6471 also reduced the density of ME1- and apoA-II-stained cells in unoccluded eyes whereas bezafibrate increased apoA-II-positive cell numbers in form-deprived eyes.As GW7647 and GW6471 had opposing effects on myopia development, PPARα signaling modulation may be involved in this condition in guinea pigs. Fibrates are potential candidates for treating myopia since they reduced both FDM and the associated axial elongation. Bezafibrate also inhibited form deprivation-induced decreases in scleral collagen type I expression and the density of apoA-II expressing cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25068567>Psammaplin a improves development and quality of somatic cell nuclear transfer mouse embryos.</a></h1><p>Faulty reprogramming of the donor somatic nucleus to a totipotent embryonic state by the recipient oocyte is a major obstacle for cloning success. Accordingly, treatment of cloned embryos with epigenetic modifiers, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), enhances cloning efficiency. The purpose of our study was to further explore the potential effect of valproic acid (VPA), used in previous studies, and to investigate the effect of psammaplin A (PsA), a novel HDACi, on the development and quality of cloned mouse embryos. To this aim, cloned embryos were treated with 5, 10, and 20 μM PsA or 2 and 4 mM VPA for 8-9 h (before and during activation) or 16 h or 24 h (during and after activation), and their in vitro developmental potential and blastocyst quality were evaluated. Treatments with 10 μM PsA and 2 mM VPA for 16 h were selected as the most optimal, showing higher blastocyst rates and quality. These treatments had no significant effects on the expression of Nanog, Oct4, and Cdx2 or on global histone and DNA methylation levels at the blastocyst stage, but both increased global levels of histone acetylation at early developmental stages. This was correlated with a two-fold (for VPA) and four-fold (for PsA) increase in full-term development, and a 11.5-fold increase when PsA was combined with the use of latrunculin A instead of cytochalasin B. In conclusion, PsA improves mouse cloning efficiency to a higher extent than VPA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24345566>Biodegradation of polyacrylamide by anaerobic digestion under mesophilic condition and its performance in actual dewatered sludge system.</a></h1><p>Polyacrylamide (PAM) used in sludge dewatering widely exists in high-solid anaerobic digestion. Degradation of polyacrylamide accompanied with accumulation of its toxic monomer is important to disposition of biogas residues. The potential of anaerobic digestion activity in microbial utilization of PAM was investigated in this study. The results indicated that the utilization rate of PAM (as nitrogen source) was influenced by accumulation of ammonia, while cumulative removal of amide group was accorded with zeroth order reaction in actual dewatered system. The adjoining amide group can combined into ether group after biodegradation. PAM can be broken down in different position of its carbon chain backbone. In actual sludge system, the hydrolytic PAM was liable to combined -rich protein to form colloid complex, and then consumed as carbon source to form monomer when easily degradable organics were exhausted. The accumulation of acrylamide was leveled off ultimately, accompanied with the yield of methane.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy are the main procedures currently performed. However, the benefits of bariatric surgery extend beyond weight loss. In fact, improvements in β-cell function occur before clinically meaningful weight loss and contribute to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) remission. Herein, we discuss evidence supporting the efficacy of bariatric surgery for weight loss and improved insulin secretion in patients with and without T2D. The exact mechanism by which bariatric surgery elicits a favorable change in β-cell function remains unclear, but a leading hypothesis is that rerouted nutrient flow to the gut alters enteroendocrine hormone production (e.g., glucagon-like polypeptide 1, polypeptide -, ghrelin), gut microbiome metabolites (e.g., lipopolysaccharides, short-chain  ), and circulating bile acid changes that favor appetite suppression, metabolic rate, and insulin action. We also highlight the role of adipose-derived factors (e.g., pancreatic fat content, adiponectin) that may have an effect on β-cell function, as well as discuss the clinical determinants of diabetes remission (e.g., age and T2D duration). Taken together, the acute improvements seen with bariatric surgery are weight-independent and likely related to incretin-mediated effects on postprandial glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Over longer periods of time, increases in bile , reductions in pancreatic lipid content, and elevated adiponectin levels may also contribute to reduced disease risk. As a result, the gut appears to be a novel target for favorably preventing and treating obesity-related metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2016 American Society for Bariatric Surgery.

Seventeen phenolic constituents were measured by reverse phase-high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Total phenolic compounds (TPCs), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) scavenging activities were performed to measure antioxidant capacity. Some kinetic parameters (Km, Vmax), and inhibition behaviors against five different substrates were measured in the crude extract. Catechin and chlorogenic acid were found as the major components in the methanolic extract, while ferulic acid, caffeic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, quercetin and p-coumaric acid were small quantities. Km values ranged from 0.70 to 10.10 mM in the substrates, and also 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid (HPPA) and L-DOPA showed the highest affinity. The inhibition constant of Ki were ranged from 0.05 to 14.90 mM against sodium metabisulphite, ascorbic acid, sodium azide and benzoic acid, while ascorbic acid and sodium metabisulphite were the best inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27070784>Metabolomics of Human Amniotic Fluid and Maternal Plasma during Normal Pregnancy.</a></h1><p>Metabolic profiles of amniotic fluid and maternal blood are sources of valuable information about fetus development and can be potentially useful in diagnosis of pregnancy disorders. In this study, we applied 1H NMR-based metabolic profiling to track metabolic changes occurring in amniotic fluid (AF) and plasma (PL) of healthy mothers over the course of pregnancy. AF and PL samples were collected in the 2nd (T2) and 3rd (T3) trimester, prolonged pregnancy (PP) until time of delivery (TD). A multivariate data analysis of both biofluids reviled a metabolic switch-like transition between 2nd and 3rd trimester, which was followed by metabolic stabilization throughout the rest of pregnancy probably reflecting the stabilization of fetal maturation and development. The differences were further tested using univariate statistics at α = 0.001. In plasma the progression from T2 to T3 was related to increasing levels of glycerol, choline and ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate) while pyruvate concentration was significantly decreased. In amniotic fluid, T2 to T3 transition was associated with decreasing levels of glucose, carnitine, amino  (valine, leucine, isoleucine, alanine, methionine, , and phenylalanine) and increasing levels of creatinine, succinate, pyruvate, choline, N,N-dimethylglycine and urocanate. Lactate to pyruvate ratio was decreased in AF and conversely increased in PL. The results of our study, show that metabolomics profiling can be used to better understand physiological changes of the complex interdependencies of the mother, the placenta and the fetus during pregnancy. In the future, these results might be a useful reference point for analysis of complicated pregnancies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27139031>Tackling aspecific side reactions during histone propionylation: The promise of reversing overpropionylation.</a></h1><p>Histone proteins are essential elements for DNA packaging. Moreover, the PTMs that are extremely abundant on these proteins, contribute in modeling chromatin structure and recruiting enzymes involved in gene regulation, DNA repair and chromosome condensation. This fundamental aspect, together with the epigenetic inheritance of histone PTMs, underlines the importance of having biochemical techniques for their characterization. Over the past two decades, significant improvements in mass accuracy and resolution of mass spectrometers have made LC-coupled MS the strategy of choice for accurate identification and quantification of protein PTMs. Nevertheless, in previous work we disclosed the limitations and biases of the most widely adopted sample preparation protocols for histone propionylation, required prior to bottom-up MS analysis. In this work, however, we put forward a new specific and efficient propionylation strategy by means of propionic anhydride. In this method, aspecific overpropionylation at serine (S), threonine (T) and  (Y) is reversed by adding hydroxylamine (HA). We recommend using this method for future analysis of histones through bottom-up MS.© 2016 The Authors. Proteomics Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Schlafen 12 (SLFN12) is a cytosolic protein that stimulates sucrase-isomaltase (SI) expression. We hypothesized that two disparate differentiating stimuli, butyrate and repetitive deformation, would each stimulate SLFN12 expression in human Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells and that increased SLFN12 expression would contribute to the differentiating activity of the human Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. We stimulated Caco-2 cells with 1-2 mM butyrate or repetitive mechanical deformation at 10 cycles/min at an average 10% strain, and measured SLFN12 and SI expression by qRT-PCR. Sodium butyrate enhanced SLFN12 expression at both 1 mM and 2 mM although SI expression was only significantly increased at 2 mM. Repetitive deformation induced by cyclic mechanical strain also significantly increased both SLFN12 and SI gene expression. Reducing SLFN12 by siRNA decreased basal, deformation-stimulated, and butyrate-stimulated SLFN12 levels, compared to control cells treated with non-targeting siRNA, although both deformation and butyrate were still able to stimulate SLFN12 expression in siRNA-treated cells compared to control cells treated with the same siRNA. This attenuation of the increase in SLFN12 expression in response to mechanical strain or butyrate was accompanied by parallel attenuation of SI expression. Butyrate stimulated SI-promoter activity, and reducing SLFN12 by siRNA attenuated butyrate-induced SI-promoter activity. These data suggest that SLFN12 mediates at least in part the stimulation by both butyrate and repetitive mechanical deformation of sucrase-isomaltase, a late stage differentiation marker in human intestinal epithelial cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28338101>The histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid inhibits NKG2D expression in natural killer cells through suppression of STAT3 and HDAC3.</a></h1><p>NKG2D is a major activating receptor of NK cells and plays a critical role in tumor immunosurveillance. NKG2D expression in NK cells is inhibited by the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) and enhanced by the narrow-spectrum HDAC inhibitor entinostat. We previously demonstrated that entinostat enhanced NKG2D transcription by increasing acetylation of Histones H3 and H4. However, the mechanism by which VPA reduces NKG2D expression in NK cells is not known. We have also shown that NKG2D transcription is regulated by STAT3 phosphorylation. In this study, we investigated regulation of NKG2D expression in NK cells by VPA and entinostat by assessing protein expression, phosphorylation, and interaction of HDACs and STAT3. We find that VPA selectively inhibits STAT3 tyrosine705 phosphorylation, but entinostat does not. STAT3 complexes with HDAC3, and HDAC3 inhibition represses STAT3 phosphorylation and therefore NKG2D expression. NK cells from STAT3 wild-type mice downregulate NKG2D in response to VPA, but not NK cells from STAT3 knockout mice. These results show that VPA is a potent inhibitor of STAT3 phosphorylation and demonstrate that histone acetylation and STAT3 tyrosine705 phosphorylation cooperate in regulating NKG2D expression in NK cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23926648>[Thyroid hormones and their precursors I. Biochemical properties].</a></h1><p>This paper and the following one (see the next issue of Acta Pharmaceutica Hungarica) survey the biological roles and the related site-specific physico-chemical parameters (basicity and lipophilicity) of the presently known thyroid hormones (thyroxine, liothyronine and reverse liothyronine) and their biological precursors (monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine). Here the literature of the thyroid hormone biochemistry, biosynthesis, plasma- and membrane transport is summarized, focusing on the pH-dependent processes. Biosyntheses of the thyroid hormones take place by oxidative coupling of two iodotyrosine residues catalyzed by thyreoperoxidase in thyreoglobulin. The protonation state of the precursors, especially that of the phenolic OH is crucial for the biosynthesis, since anionic iodotyrosine residues can only be coupled in the thyroid hormone biosyntheses. In the blood more than 99% of the circulating thyroid hormone is bound to plasma proteins among which the thyroxine-binding globulin and transthyretin are crucial. The amphiphilic character of the hormones is assumed to be the reason why their membrane transport is an energy-dependent, transport-mediated process, in which the organic anion transporter family, mainly OATP1C1, and the amino acid transporters, such as MCT8 play important roles. Liothyronine is the biologically active hormone; it binds the thyroid hormone receptor, a type of nuclear receptor. There are two major thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, alfa (TRalpha) and beta (TRbeta). The activation of the TRalpha is associated with modifications in cardiac behavior, while activation of the TRbeta is associated with increasing metabolic rates, resulting in weight loss and reduction of blood plasma lipid levels. The affinity of the thyroid hormones for different proteins depends on the ionization state of the ligands. The site-specific physico-chemical characterization of the thyroid hormones is of fundamental importance to understand their (patho)physiological behavior and also, to influence their therapeutic properties at the molecular level.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25220639>Metabolomic analysis of simvastatin and fenofibrate intervention in high-lipid diet-induced hyperlipidemia rats.</a></h1><p>To investigate the metabolite changes caused by simvastatin or fenofibrate intervention in diet-induced hyperlipidemia rats using a GC-MS-based metabolomic profiling approach.SD rats were fed with high-lipid diet for 4 weeks to induce hyperlipidemia, then the rats were fed with normal diet, and orally administered with simvastatin (10 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1)) or fenofibrate (150 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1)) for 2 weeks. Blood samples were collected once a week, and potential biomarkers were examined using commercial assay kits and a metabolomic approach. The metabolomics data were analyzed using a multivariate statistical technique and a principal component analysis (PCA).Oral administration of simvastatin or fenofibrate significantly decreased the plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and increased the plasma level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in the hyperlipidemia rats. Plasma samples were scattered in the PCA scores plots in response to the diet and to the drugs administered. The main metabolites changed in the hyperlipidemia rats were cholesterol, creatinine, linoleic acid, β-hydroxybutyric acid, , isoleucine and ornithine. The plasma level of creatinine was significantly lower in the simvastatin-treated rats than in the fenofibrate-treated rats. The plasma  concentration was declined following intake of high-lipid diet, which was reversed by fenobrate, but not by simvastatin.A series of potential biomarkers including , creatinine, linoleic acid, β-hydroxybutyric acid and ornithine have been identified by metabolomic profiling, which may be used to identify the metabolic changes during hyperlipidemia progression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29624009>The concentration of free amino  in blood serum of dairy cows with primary ketosis.</a></h1><p>Ketosis is a common condition found in the initial stages of lactation in high-yielding dairy cows. The major cause of ketosis is a negative energy balance. During the energy deficiency, proteolysis processes develop parallel to lipolysis. During proteolysis, muscle tissue can be used as a source of amino acid. To date, the participation of amino  in gluconeogenesis (glucogenic amino ) and ketogenesis (ketogenic amino ) has not been determined in detail. This paper presents the study on determination of the parameters of protein and free amino acid metabolism in blood serum of dairy cows with primary ketosis compared to healthy cows. This study contributes to better understanding of the role of amino  in pathogenesis of ketosis. A total of 30 cows, divided into two groups: experimental (15 cows with ketosis) and control (15 healthy cows), were included in the study. The concentrations of glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate, total protein, albumin, urea, and free amino  were determined in peripheral blood. Statistically significantly higher concentrations of glutamine, glutamic acid, isoleucine (p≤0.001), and  (p≤0.05) were found in cows with primary ketosis compared to healthy cows. Significant decrease in the concentrations of asparagine, histidine, methionine, and serine (p≤0.001), alanine, leucine, lysine and proline (p≤0.05) was observed. Significant increase of total ketogenic and glucogenic amino  (p≤0.05), and an increased ratio of total ketogenic and glucogenic amino  to total amino  (p≤0.001) were noted in cows with ketosis. In our study, the changes, in particular observed in amino acid concentration in cows with primary ketosis, indicate its intensive use in both ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis processes. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the role that amino  play in gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis will improve ketosis diagnostics and monitoring the course of a ketosis episode. Perhaps, the prevention of this disease is possible by balancing the appropriate feed ration in terms of amino acid content.Copyright© by the Polish Academy of Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30830506>Erlotinib-Valproic Acid Liquisolid Formulation: Evaluating Oral Bioavailability and Cytotoxicity in Erlotinib-Resistant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Cells.</a></h1><p>Lung cancer patients develop acquired resistance to  kinase inhibitors including erlotinib (ERL) after few months of primary treatment. Evidently, new chemotherapy strategies to delay or overcome the resistance are urgently needed to improve the clinical outcome in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. In this paper, we have investigated the cytotoxic interaction of ERL and valproic acid (VA) in ERL-resistant NSCLC cells and developed a liquisolid formulation of ERL-VA for improving oral bioavailability of ERL. ERL is weakly basic, biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS) class II drug with extremely poor aqueous solubility while VA is a branched chain  acid. Ionic interaction between ERL and VA (1:2 M ratio) resulted in significant enhancement in saturation solubility of ERL at different pH range. Liquisolid formulation of ERL-VA (EVLF) developed using PEG 400 and mesoporous calcium silicate was characterized for solid state and in vitro dissolution in biorelevant dissolution medium (FaSSIF and FeSSIF). Cytotoxicity of ERL was enhanced by 2-5 folds on co-incubation with VA in HCC827/ERL cell line. Flow cytometry analysis using AnnexinV-FITC assay demonstrated that VA and ERL alone have poor apoptotic effect on HCC827/ERL cells while combination showed around 69% apoptotic cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the role of survivin in overcoming resistance. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies of EVLF in rats demonstrated a 199% relative bioavailability compared to ERL suspension. Thus, EVLF could be a promising alternative to current ERL formulations in the treatment of NSCLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26945858>Profiling of acidic (amino and phenolic ) and phenylpropanoids production in response to methyl jasmonate-induced oxidative stress in Scrophularia striata suspension cells.</a></h1><p>A metabolic profiling including calculation of energy cost of amino  biosynthesis in cultured cells of Scrophularia striata showed that methyl jasmonate-inducible oxidative stress elicited secondary metabolites formation derived from phenylalanine and  and increased energy cost for these amino  biosynthesis. Understanding of the metabolic pathways in cell culture of Scrophularia striata, an aromatic plant species, facilitates means of production of pharmaceutical metabolites under oxidative stress. In this study, we evaluated the effects of MeJA on the S. striata metabolic pathway and the responses to oxidative stress. Exposure to methyl jasmonate (MeJA) affects plant growth, effectively induces production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inserts oxidative stress at the cellular level which results in alteration of primary metabolites and production of phenylepropanoid compounds. Cells treated with MeJA indicated increase in the activities of three antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (GPx) as well as intracellular H2O2 and MDA contents compared with mock-treated cells. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based metabolome analysis revealed dynamic metabolic changes in oxidatively stressed S. striata cells, e.g., general phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylethanoid-glycosides, lignans, and increased energy cost of biosynthesis and accumulation of amino . Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA)-derived score plots demonstrated that MeJA affects cellular metabolism in S. striata cells and significantly alters metabolite composition under MeJA-inducible oxidative stress. These observations suggest that MeJA-elicited cell suspension cultures of S. striata balanced the production of primary and secondary metabolites in coordination with ROS-scavenging system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29889427>EFFECT OF CARBOXYLIC  OF GUT MICROBIAL ORIGIN ON HOST CELL PROLIFERATION IN ORGANOTYPIC TISSUE CULTURES.</a></h1><p>Intestinal microbiota produces many carboxylic , especially short chain   () as a result of carbohydrates, fats and proteins fermentation and which are intermediates in the interaction of the microbiota and the host.  (formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate) are formed by the anaerobic carbohydrates fermentation and branched-chain   (BCFA), such as isobutyric and isovaleric , are derived from amino  valine and leucine. Phenylcarboxylic  (PCA), such as phenylacetic acid (PAA), phenyipropionic acid (PPA), phenyllactic acid (PLA) and some other , are metabolites of amino  phenylalanine and  involved in host adaptation and regulation. ma unique experiment, the authors first examined effect of the carboxylic  on host cell proliferation in organotypic tissue cultures (rat spleen explants). The study showed that almost all biogenic aliphatic carboxylic  have a positive effect on cell proliferation in rat spleen tissue. This fundamentally distinguishes them from amino , many of which have an inhibitory effect at the same concentrations. These findings suggest that , including hydrox~ and oxo derivatives, can act as positive regulators of host immune tissues. Some  (for example, butyric acid), stimulate proliferation of normal host cells (immune tissue, intestinal epithelium), but inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells ('butyrate paradox'). Unlike , phenylcarboxylic  have a negative effect on host immune tissues explants and induce apoptosis. These data confirm the potential contribution of phenylcarboxylic  in the pathogenesis of chronic disorders associated with impaired immune response, including autoimmune diseases. The authors suggest that PCA may serve as early metabolic markers of sepsis, immune-related diseases and chronic inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (iBD), colorectal cancer, chronic kidney disease and liver, secondary imrnunodeficiency. It can be assumed that carboxylic  are evolutionary precursors of amino  that have a wide variety of functions and able to modulate not only proliferation but also apoptosis. The results agree well with the data obtained in the study of Actoflor-C (microbial metabolites complex) and can be used to study mechanisms of action of probiotic strains and metabiotics (e.g. butyrate and propionate-containing formulations), as well as for the development of innovative medicines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28760006>Biological activity and LC-MS profiling of ethyl acetate extracts from Nitraria sibirica (Pall.) fruits.</a></h1><p>Nitraria sibirica is a traditional Uighur medicine. This study was undertaken to investigate the bioactivity of N. sibirica fruit extract and to evaluate their chemical compositions. The ethyl acetate extract from N. sibirica fruits exhibited the potential antioxidant activity (SC = 30.17 ± 0.06 μg/mL) and protein  phosphatase 1B inhibitory activity (IC = 7.15 ± 0.03 μg/mL) in vitro. In order to investigate the active constituents in this extract, a LC-QTOF-MS/MS method was developed and established. A total of 28 compounds including seven cinnamic , nine benzoic  and 12 flavonoids were identified or partially characterised according to the accurate mass and the characteristic fragment ions at low and high collision energy. Most of them were reported for the first time in this plant. Phytochemical profiles of the active extract will help the development and utilisation of N. sibirica in food and medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26103530>Histone deacetylases inhibitors effects on Cryptococcus neoformans major virulence phenotypes.</a></h1><p>Cryptococcus neoformans undergoes phenotypical changes during host infection in order to promote persistence and survival. Studies have demonstrated that such adaptations require alterations in gene transcription networks by distinct mechanisms. Drugs such as the histone deacetylases inhibitors (HDACi) Sodium Butyrate (NaBut) and Trichostatin A (TSA) can alter the chromatin conformation and have been used to modulate epigenetic states in the treatment of diseases such as cancer. In this work, we have studied the effect of NaBut and TSA on the expression of C. neoformans major virulence phenotypes and on the survival rate of an animal model infected with drugs-treated yeasts. Both drugs affected fungal growth at 37°C more intensely than at 30°C; nonetheless, drugs did not affect cell viability at the concentrations we studied. HDACi also provoked the reduction of the fungal capsule expansion. Phospholipases enzyme activity decreased; mating process and melanin synthesis were also affected by both inhibitors. NaBut led to an increase in the population of cells in G2/M. Treated yeast cells, which were washed in order to remove the drugs from the culture medium prior to the inoculation in the Galleria mellonela infection model, did not cause significant difference at the host survival curve when compared to non-treated cells. Overall, NaBut effects on the impairment of C. neoformans main virulence factors were more intense and stable than the TSA effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30882808>Native mass spectrometry beyond ammonium acetate: effects of nonvolatile salts on protein stability and structure.</a></h1><p>Native mass spectrometry is widely used to probe the structures, stabilities, and stoichiometries of proteins and biomolecular complexes in aqueous solutions, typically containing  ammonium acetate or ammonium bicarbonate buffer. In this study, nanoelectrospray emitters with submicron tips are used to produce significantly desalted ions of RNase A and a reduced, alkylated form of this protein, RA-RNase A, from solutions containing 175 mM ammonium acetate, as well as sodium chloride and Tris containing solutions with the same nominal ionic strength and pH. The charge-state distributions formed by nanoelectrospray ionization and  fluorescence emission data as a function of temperature from these solutions indicate that the folded form of RA-RNase A in solution is stabilized when ammonium acetate is replaced by increasing quantities of NaCl and Tris. Ion mobility data for the 7+ charge state of RA-RNase A indicates that the protein conformation in ammonium acetate changes with increasing concentration of NaCl which stablizes more compact structures. These results are consistent with observations reported 130 years ago by Hofmeister who found that ion identity can affect the stabilities and the structures of proteins in solution. This study indicates the importance of buffer choice when interpreting native mass spectrometry data.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25835227>Molecular dynamics studies of modular polyketide synthase ketoreductase stereospecificity.</a></h1><p>Ketoreductases (KRs) from modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) can perform stereospecific catalysis, selecting a polyketide with a D- or L-α-methyl substituent for NADPH-mediated reduction. In this report, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the interactions that control stereospecificity. We studied the A1-type KR from the second module of the amphotericin PKS (A1), which is known to be stereospecific for a D-α-methyl-substituted diketide substrate (dkD). MD simulations of two ternary complexes comprised of the enzyme, NADPH, and either the correct substrate, dkD, or its enantiomer (dkL) were performed. The coordinates for the A1/NADPH binary complex were obtained from a crystal structure (PDB entry 3MJS), and substrates were modeled in the binding pocket in conformations appropriate for reduction. Simulations were intended to reproduce the initial weak binding of the polyketide substrate to the enzyme. Long (tens of nanoseconds) MD simulations show that the correct substrate is retained in a conformation closer to the reactive configuration. Many short (up to a nanosecond) MD runs starting from the initial structures display evidence that Q364, three residues N-terminal to the catalytic , forms a hydrogen bond to the incorrect dkL substrate to yield an unreactive conformation that is more favorable than the reactive configuration. This interaction is not as strong for dkD, as the D-α-methyl substituent is positioned between the glutamine and the reactive site. This result correlates with experimental findings [Zheng, J., et al. (2010) Structure 18, 913-922] in which a Q364H mutant was observed to lose stereospecificity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25997692>NMR-based metabolomics highlights differences in plasma metabolites in pigs exhibiting diet-induced differences in adiposity.</a></h1><p>A better understanding of the control of body fat mass and distribution is required for both human health and animal production. The current study investigates plasma parameters in response to changes in body fat mass.Pigs from two lines divergently selected for residual feed intake were fed diets contrasted in energy sources and nutrients. Between 74 and 132 days of age, pigs (n = 12 by diet and by line) received isoproteic and isoenergetic diets, either rich in starch (LF) or in lipids and fibres (HF). At the end of the feeding trial, plasma samples were analysed by (1)H NMR spectroscopy and standard hormonal and biochemical assays.Pigs fed the HF diet had lower (P < 0.01) perirenal and subcutaneous adipose tissue relative masses than pigs fed the LF diet. Metabolomic approach showed a clear discrimination between diets, with lower (P < 0.05) plasma levels of creatinine-lysine, creatine, , proline, histidine, lysine, phenylalanine and formate but higher (P < 0.001) plasma VLDL-LDL levels in HF pigs than in LF pigs. Plasma concentrations of triglycerides were higher (P < 0.001), while plasma concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate, leptin, glucose, insulin and urea were lower (P ≤ 0.05) in HF pigs than in LF pigs. Plasma levels of leptin, creatine and urea were positively correlated (r = 0.3, P < 0.05) with relative adipose tissue masses.These data indicate that metabolites associated with energy and protein metabolism were involved in the response to a high-fat, high-fibre diet. Relevant plasma indicators of metabolic flexibility related to changes in body adiposity were then proposed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29422013>First and second trimester urinary metabolic profiles and fetal growth restriction: an exploratory nested case-control study within the infant development and environment study.</a></h1><p>Routine prenatal care fails to identify a large proportion of women at risk of fetal growth restriction (FGR). Metabolomics, the comprehensive analysis of low molecular weight molecules (metabolites) in biological samples, can provide new and earlier biomarkers of prenatal health. Recent research has suggested possible predictive first trimester urine metabolites correlating to fetal growth restriction in the third trimester. Our objective in this current study was to examine urinary metabolic profiles in the first and second trimester of pregnancy in relation to third trimester FGR in a US population from a large, multi-center cohort study of healthy pregnant women.We conducted a nested case-control study within The Infant Development and the Environment Study (TIDES), a population-based multi-center pregnancy cohort study. We identified 53 cases of FGR based on the AUDIPOG [Neonatal growth - AUDIPOG [Internet]. [cited 29 Nov 2016]. Available from: http://www.audipog.net/courbes_morpho.php?langue=en ] formula for birthweight percentile considering maternal height, age, and prenatal weight, as well as infant sex, gestational age, and birth rank. Cases were matched to 106 controls based on study site, maternal age (± 2 years), parity, and infant sex. NMR spectroscopy was used to assess concentrations of four urinary metabolites that have been previously associated with FGR (, acetate, formate, and trimethylamine) in first and second trimester urine samples. We fit multivariate conditional logistic regression models to estimate the odds of FGR in relation to urinary concentrations of these individual metabolites in the first and second trimesters. Exploratory analyses of custom binned spectroscopy results were run to consider other potentially related metabolites.We found no significant association between the relative concentrations of each of the four metabolites and odds of FGR. Exploratory analyses did not reveal any significant differences in urinary metabolic profiles. Compared with controls, cases delivered earlier (38.6 vs 39.8, p < 0.001), and had lower birthweights (2527 g vs 3471 g, p < 0.001). Maternal BMI was similar between cases and controls.First and second trimester concentrations of urinary metabolites (acetate, formate, trimethylamine and ) did not predict FGR. This inconsistency with previous studies highlights the need for more rigorous investigation and data collection in this area before metabolomics can be clinically applied to obstetrics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30144942>Maternal voluntary exercise ameliorates learning deficit in rat pups exposed, in utero, to valproic acid; role of BDNF and VEGF and their receptors.</a></h1><p>In utero exposure to therapeutic doses of valproic acid (VPA) during pregnancy can produce physical malformation and CNS abnormalities in the offspring. There is evidence indicating that even lower doses of VPA during pregnancy could cause cognitive impairment in offspring. It has been demonstrated that maternal exercise has positive effects on offspring's cognitive function. In this study we evaluated the preventive potential of maternal voluntary exercise on cognitive deficits induced by in utero exposure to VPA, in rat pups. Furthermore, the alteration of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and their respective receptors were measured. In treatment groups, pregnant rats received VPA (10 and 20 mg/kg) daily on the gestation days (GD) 7 for twelve days with or without access to a running wheel. In control groups, rats received saline with or without access to a running wheel. On postnatal day (PND) 30, learning and memory of rat pups were assessed using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) task. Also, on PND 30, hippocampal BDNF and VEGF were measured by ELISA and western blot analysis respectively. VEGFR (VEGF receptor) and TrkB ( receptor kinase B, the receptor for BDNF) expressions were assessed using immunofluorescence staining. Results revealed that maternal voluntary exercise enhanced learning in offspring but had little effect on memory retention. Exposure to VPA during pregnancy disturbed learning and memory in rat pups. Maternal voluntary exercise could ameliorate some aspects of cognitive deficit induced by VPA. TrkB and VEGFR2 expression were enhanced in pups from running mothers. VPA, at both doses, suppressed exercise induced expression of these two receptors. Voluntary exercise and to a much greater extent VPA administration increased hippocampal BDNF. Voluntary exercise of mothers caused an enhance expression of VEGF in rat pups as did VPA administration, although to a smaller amount.Copyright © 2018.

To ghrelin multiple functions have been ascribed including promotion of gastrointestinal motility. Postprandial ghrelin levels have been reported to be reduced in patients suffering from Parkinson disease (PD). Experimental studies revealed neuroprotective effects of ghrelin in different PD models. The purpose of the present study was (i) to further elucidate the mechanism underlying the neuroprotective action of ghrelin and (ii) to determine whether these effects occur with both the acylated and the unacylated form. The study was conducted in primary mesencephalic cultures treated with mitochondrial complex I and complex II inhibitors. We show that protective effects of ghrelin against complex I inhibition with MPP were independent of the acylation status of ghrelin, although acylated ghrelin appeared to be more potent. Protection by both forms was also observed when neurons were exposed to the complex II inhibitor 3-NP. Both forms led to higher oxygen consumption rates upon electron transport chain uncoupling, indicating that the two peptides may exert uncoupling effects themselves. We demonstrate that the rescue provided by ghrelin required calcium influx through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Whereas the protective effects of acylated ghrelin required receptor binding, effects of the unacylated form remained unaffected by treatment with a ghrelin receptor antagonist. Importantly, inhibition of ghrelin O-acyltransferase failed to reduce the activity of unacylated ghrelin. Overall, our data suggest that both acylated and unacylated ghrelin afford protection to dopamine neurons but through mechanisms that only partially overlap.Copyright © 2017 IBRO.

All residues are located at a single surface-exposed location of PhaZ7. Exchange of these amino  by less hydrophobic, hydrophilic or negatively charged residues reduced binding of PhaZ7 to PHB. Modifications of other residues at the PhaZ7 surface (F9, Y66, Y103, Y124, Y169, Y172, Y173, F198, Y203, Y204, F251, W252) had no effect on substrate binding. The PhaZ7 wild-type protein, three muteins with single amino acid exchanges (Y105A, Y105E, Y190E), a PhaZ7 variant with deletion of residues 202-208, and PhaZ7 in which the active-site serine had been replaced by alanine (S136A) were crystallized and their structures were determined at 1.6-2.0 Å resolution. The structures were almost identical but revealed flexibility of some regions. Structural analysis of PhaZ7 (S136A) with bound 3-hydroxybutyrate tetramer showed that the substrate binds in a cleft that is composed of Y105, Y176, Y189 and Y190 and thus confirmed the data obtained by site-directed mutagenesis.

After incubation, lactic, acetic, and citric acid concentrations showed a difference among the samples due to milk type and production methods. Storage time had little effect on the organic acid values of kefir samples. As compared with cow milk kefir, buffalo milk kefir had higher numbers of microorganisms, except lactobacilli, at the end of storage. Whereas pH and titratable acidity exhibited similar changes during storage in all kefir samples, ethanol levels were significantly increased in buffalo milk kefir samples. Glutamic acid was the major amino acid at all sampling times for all samples. , serine, histidine, alanine, methionine, and lysine concentrations were determined to be different in all samples depending on milk type. In general, due to the higher microbial population (especially yeast), kefir made from buffalo milk may be preferred.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A total of 32 healthy weaners (9.60 ± 0.13 kg) were allocated to two dietary energy densities (3,400 and 3,800 kcal/kg) and two digestible energy ratio of carbohydrate to fat (9:1 and 3:1) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. There were eight piglets per treatment. The feed intake of piglets was significantly increased by dietary high carbohydrate ratio (9:1) (p < 0.01); however, this did not result in improved body weight gain (p > 0.05). The piglets fed high carbohydrate energy ratio had a reduced villus height/crypt depth (VH/CD) ratio in the duodenum (p < 0.05), and dietary high energy density further decreased the VH/CD ratio in the ileum (p < 0.01). In the duodenum, the lymphocyte count was increased by dietary high energy density (p < 0.05), while dietary energy density and carbohydrate energy ratio interacted to increase lymphocyte count in the ileum (p < 0.05). The serum cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein were not significantly affected (p > 0.05), but dietary energy density interacted with dietary energy ratio to increase high-density lipoprotein concentration (p < 0.05) in piglets fed reduced carbohydrate energy ratio. Dietary high energy density reduced energy digestibility (p < 0.05), whereas high carbohydrate energy ratio increased crude protein digestibility in the piglets (p < 0.05). The intestinal sucrase, lactase activities and serum concentrations of histidine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, alanine, glycine,  and citrulline were higher in the piglets fed dietary increased carbohydrate energy ratio. Oxidative stress markers and  concentrations were altered by the dietary treatments. It was concluded that dietary high energy density could be detrimental to piglets intestinal functions and that increased carbohydrate energy ratio could affect amino acid utilization and body weight gain in weaner pigs.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27471084>Changes in aggregation behavior of collagen molecules in solution with varying concentrations of acetic acid.</a></h1><p>A critical aggregation concentration of 0.30-0.50mg/mL was previously obtained for type I collagen at 0.1M acetic acid (AA). In the present study, the aggregation behavior of collagen in solution (0.5mg/mL) in the presence of 0.1-2.0M AA was investigated. Circular dichroism showed that the three helix structure was maintained across the whole AA concentration range. However, the ratio of positive peak intensity over negative peak intensity varied depending on the conformational state of collagen aggregates. Ultra-sensitive differential scanning calorimetry revealed that transition temperatures Tm and Tm decreased by 8.35°C and 7.80°C, respectively, between 0.1M and 2.0M, indicating a possible relationship between the aggregation state and the thermal effect. The surrounding polarity of collagen molecules in solution containing pyrene was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy, which demonstrated that disaggregation of collagen aggregates was enhanced with increasing AA concentration. This observation was correlated with changes in collagen fiber size observed by atomic force microscopy. Furthermore, collagen  residues were blue-shifted in an intrinsic fluorescence spectra, further indicating changes in aggregation behavior with increasing AA concentration. Finally, the dynamic response of collagen molecules to AA was analyzed by two-dimensional correlation fluorescence spectra.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It is very difficult to cure. In recent years, a lot of attention has been given to chemoprevention. This method uses natural and synthetic compounds to interfere with and inhibit the process of carcinogenesis. In this study, a new treatment strategy was proposed consisting of a combination of 5,7-dimethoxycoumarin (DMC), an activator of melanogenesis, and valproic acid (VPA), a well-known drug that is one of the histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis). In conjunction with 1 mM VPA, all of the tested concentrations of DMC (10-150 μM) significantly decreased the proliferation of A-375 cells. VPA and DMC also induced the synthesis of melanin and the formation of dendrite and star-shaped cells. Tyrosinase gene expression and tyrosinase activity significantly increased in response to VPA treatment. Pyrolysis with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) was used to investigate the structure of the isolated melanin. This showed that the quantitative and qualitative components of melanin degradation products are dependent on the type of applied melanogenesis inductor. Products derived from eumelanin were detected in the pyrolytic profile of melanin isolated from A-375 cells stimulated with DMC. Thermal degradation of melanin isolated from melanoma cells after exposure to VPA or a mixture of VPA and DMC revealed the additional presence of products derived from pheomelanin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25975614>Biosynthesis of Two Flavones, Apigenin and Genkwanin, in Escherichia coli.</a></h1><p>The flavonoid apigenin and its O-methyl derivative, genkwanin, have various biological activities and can be sourced from some vegetables and fruits.

Blood for appetite hormones and  was collected at intervals over 6 h. A standard lunch was served 4 h after the test drink.Relative to GLU, IN, but not RS, significantly increased  areas under the curve (AUC) from 4-6 h (AUC). Neither IN nor RS affected GLP-1 or PYY-AUC. Although neither IN nor RS reduced ghrelin-AUC compared with GLU, ghrelin at 6 h after IN was significantly lower than that after GLU (P<0.05). After IN, relative to GLU, the changes in -AUC were negatively related to the changes in ghrelin-AUC (P=0.017).  and hormone responses did not differ significantly between LN and OWO.Acute increases in colonic  do not affect GLP-1 or PYY responses in LN or OWO subjects, but may reduce ghrelin.

While it is well known to cause postural tremor, hyperammonemia, slowness, and sedation, it has also been described to occasionally cause a reversible form of parkinsonism.A series of five cases is reported.All patients were taking the drug for at least several months before onset of their parkinsonian symptoms. Parkinsonism was defined by the presence of bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability, and resting tremor, but not postural or action tremor. After discontinuing their valproic acid, improvement was seen by all patients. The course of improvement took days to months after discontinuance. Two of these patients responded to dopaminergic therapy, with drug-induced dyskinesia observed in one. In another patient, valproic acid was thought to unmask underlying Parkinson's Disease; this patient benefited from levodopa as well.Valproic acid-induced parkinsonism can look identical to idiopathic parkinsonism. In all five cases, the relationship between the valproic acid use and parkinsonism was initially unclear because of the delayed and insidious onset. Our finding of levodopa responsiveness and dyskinesia added to the diagnostic confusion. This treatment responsiveness also set it apart from neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism. In all cases improvement of symptoms occurred after discontinuation of the offending medication.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, currently available antidepressants used in clinical practice are ineffective for a substantial proportion of patients and always have side effects. Besides being a lipid-regulating agent, gemfibrozil is an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α). We investigated the antidepressant effects of gemfibrozil on C57BL/6J mice using the forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), as well as the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of depression. The changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling cascade in the brain after CUMS and gemfibrozil treatment were further assessed. Pharmacological inhibitors and lentivirus-expressed short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were also used to clarify the antidepressant mechanisms of gemfibrozil. Gemfibrozil exhibited significant antidepressant actions in the FST and TST without affecting the locomotor activity of mice. Chronic gemfibrozil administration fully reversed CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviors in the FST, TST and sucrose preference test. Gemfibrozil treatment also restored CUMS-induced inhibition of the hippocampal BDNF signaling pathway. Blocking PPAR-α and BDNF but not the serotonergic system abolished the antidepressant effects of gemfibrozil on mice. Gemfibrozil produced antidepressant effects in mice by promoting the hippocampal BDNF system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28299546>Combinatorial analysis of enzymatic bottlenecks of  pathway by p-coumaric acid production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</a></h1><p>To identify new enzymatic bottlenecks of  pathway for further improving the production of  and its derivatives.When ARO4 and ARO7 were deregulated by their feedback resistant derivatives in the host strains, the ARO2 and TYR1 genes, coding for chorismate synthase and prephenate dehydrogenase were further identified as new important rate-limiting steps. The yield of p-coumaric acid in the feedback-resistant strain overexpressing ARO2 or TYR1, was significantly increased from 6.4 to 16.2 and 15.3 mg l, respectively. Subsequently, we improved the strain by combinatorial engineering of pathway genes increasing the yield of p-coumaric acid by 12.5-fold (from 1.7 to 21.3 mg l) compared with the wild-type strain. Batch cultivations revealed that p-coumaric acid production was correlated with cell growth, and the formation of by-product acetate of the best producer NK-M6 increased to 31.1 mM whereas only 19.1 mM acetate was accumulated by the wild-type strain.Combinatorial metabolic engineering provides a new strategy for further improvement of  or other metabolic biosynthesis pathways in S. cerevisiae.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24845880>Effects of resistant starch on behaviour, satiety-related hormones and metabolites in growing pigs.</a></h1><p>Resistant starch (RS) has been suggested to prolong satiety in adult pigs. The present study investigated RS-induced changes in behaviour, satiety-related hormones and metabolites in catheterized growing pigs to explore possible underlying mechanisms for RS-induced satiety. In a cross-over design with two 14-day periods, 10 pigs (initial BW: 58 kg) were assigned to two treatments comprising diets containing either 35% pregelatinized starch (PS) or 34% retrograded starch (RS). Diets were isoenergetic on gross energy. Pigs were fed at 2.8× maintenance. Postprandial plasma response of satiety-related hormones and metabolites was measured at the end of each period using frequent blood sampling. Faecal and urinary energy losses were measured at the end of each period. Behaviour was scored 24 h from video recordings using scan sampling. Energy digestibility and metabolizability were ~6% lower in RS compared with PS diet (P<0.001), and metabolizable energy (ME) intake was ~3% lower in RS-fed than in PS-fed pigs (P<0.001). RS-fed pigs showed less feeder-directed (P=0.001) and drinking (P=0.10) behaviours than PS-fed pigs throughout the day. Postprandial peripheral short-chain  acid () levels were higher in RS-fed than in PS-fed pigs (P<0.001). Postprandial glucose and insulin responses were lower in RS-fed than in PS-fed pigs (P<0.001). Triglyceride levels were higher in RS-fed than in PS-fed pigs (P<0.01), and non-esterified  acid levels did not differ between diets (P=0.90). Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels were lower in RS-fed than in PS-fed pigs (P<0.001), and peptide   (PYY) levels did not differ between diets (P=0.90). Blood serotonin levels were lower (P<0.001), whereas monoamine oxidase activity (P<0.05) and tryptophan (P<0.01) levels were higher in RS-fed than in PS-fed pigs. Despite a lower ME intake, RS seemed to prolong satiety, based on behavioural observations. Possible underlying mechanisms for RS-induced satiety include increased 24 h plasma  levels, and decreased postprandial glucose and insulin responses. GLP-1 and PYY seemed not to play a role in RS-induced satiety. Low blood serotonin levels in RS-fed pigs suggested a difference in intestinal serotonin release between treatments. Increased postprandial plasma triglyceride levels corresponded with increased  levels, but it is unclear whether triglycerides may have signalled satiety in RS-fed pigs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29189605>Involvement of Aromatic Metabolites in the Pathogenesis of Septic Shock.</a></h1><p>We hypothesized that aromatic microbial metabolites (AMM), such as phenyllactic (PhLA), p-hydroxyphenylacetic (p-HPhAA), and p-hydroxyphenyllactic (p-HPhLA) , contribute to the pathogenesis of septic shock.Clinical and laboratory data of patients with community-acquired pneumonia were obtained on intensive care unit admission and the next day. Patients were divided into two groups based on septic shock presence or absence. The levels of AMM (PhLA, p-HPhAA, p-HPhLA, and their sum, ∑3AMM), catecholamine metabolites (3,4-dihydroxymandelic [DHMA], 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic [DOPAC], and homovanillic [HVA] ), lactate, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and procalcitonin (PCT) were compared. Correlations between AMM and clinical and laboratory data were calculated.There were 20 patients in the septic shock group and 21 in the nonseptic shock group. On admission, the septic shock patients demonstrated significantly higher levels of PhLA (2.3 vs. 0.8 μmol/L), p-HPhAA (4.6 vs. 1.4 μmol/L), p-HPhLA (7.4 vs. 2.6 μmol/L), HVA, lactate, and significantly lower levels of iNOS. The next day, the two groups also showed significant differences in the levels of PCT and NT-proBNP. The correlation between ∑3AMM and presence of shock, levels of lactate, HVA, and NT-proBNP on admission was 0.44, 0.67, 0.57, and 0.38, respectively, and the correlation on the next day was 0.59, 0.73, 0.76, and 0.6, respectively (P < 0.01). These findings can be explained by the ability of AMM to reduce  hydroxylase activity, thus limiting the synthesis of catecholamines.AMM are involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31159256>Low-Dose Stevia (Rebaudioside A) Consumption Perturbs Gut Microbiota and the Mesolimbic Dopamine Reward System.</a></h1><p>Stevia is a natural low-calorie sweetener that is growing in popularity in food and beverage products. Despite its widespread use, little is understood of its impact on the gut microbiota, an important environmental factor that can mediate metabolism and subsequent obesity and disease risk. Furthermore, given previous reports of dysbiosis with some artificial low-calorie sweeteners, we wanted to understand whether prebiotic consumption could rescue potential stevia-mediated changes in gut microbiota. Three-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to consume: (1) Water (CTR); (2) Rebaudioside A (STV); (3) prebiotic (PRE); (4) Rebaudioside A + prebiotic (SP) ( = 8/group) for 9 weeks. Rebaudioside was added to drinking water and prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin added to control diet (10%). Body weight and feces were collected weekly and food and fluid intake biweekly. Oral glucose and insulin tolerance tests, gut permeability tests, dual X-ray absorptiometry, and tissue harvest were performed at age 12 weeks. Rebaudioside A consumption alone did not alter weight gain or glucose tolerance compared to CTR. Rebaudioside A did, however, alter gut microbiota composition and reduce nucleus accumbens  hydroxylase and dopamine transporter mRNA levels compared to CTR. Prebiotic animals, alone or with Rebaudioside A, had reduced fat mass, food intake, and gut permeability and cecal  concentration. Adding Rebaudioside A did not interfere with the benefits of the prebiotic except for a significant reduction in cecal weight. Long-term low-dose Rebaudioside A consumption had little effect on glucose metabolism and weight gain; however, its impact on gut microbial taxa should be further examined in populations exhibiting dysbiosis such as obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25809828>Urinary (1)H-NMR-based metabolic profiling of children with NAFLD undergoing VSL#3 treatment.</a></h1><p>Nowadays, non-alcoholic  liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common chronic liver diseases in children. Our recent clinical trial demonstrated that dietary and VSL#3-based interventions may improve  liver by ultrasound and body mass index (BMI) after 4 months.As in this short-term trial, as in others, it is impracticable to monitor response to therapy or treatment by liver biopsy, we aimed to identify a panel of potential non-invasive metabolic biomarkers by a urinary metabolic profiling.Urine samples from a group of 31 pediatric NAFLD patients, enrolled in a VSL#3 clinical trial, were analyzed by high-resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in combination with analysis of variance-Simultaneous Component Analysis model and multivariate data analyses. Urinary metabolic profiles were interpreted in terms of clinical patient feature, treatment and chronology pattern correlations.VSL#3 treatment induced changes in NAFLD urinary metabolic phenotype mainly at level of host amino-acid metabolism (that is, valine, , 3-amino-isobutyrate or β-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA)), nucleic acid degradation (pseudouridine), creatinine metabolism (methylguanidine) and secondarily at the level of gut microbial amino-acid metabolism (that is, 2-hydroxyisobutyrate from valine degradation). Furthermore, some of these metabolites correlated with clinical primary and secondary trial end points after VSL#3 treatment:  and the organic acid U4 positively with alanine aminotransferase (R=0.399, P=0.026) and BMI (R=0.36, P=0.045); BAIBA and  negatively with active glucagon-like-peptide 1 (R=-0.51, P=0.003; R=-0.41, P=0.021, respectively).VSL#3 treatment-dependent urinary metabotypes of NAFLD children may be considered as non-invasive effective biomarkers to evaluate the response to treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23791666>Acetate in mixotrophic growth medium affects photosystem II in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and protects against photoinhibition.</a></h1><p>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a photoautotrophic green alga, which can be grown mixotrophically in acetate-supplemented media (Tris-acetate-phosphate). We show that acetate has a direct effect on photosystem II (PSII). As a consequence, Tris-acetate-phosphate-grown mixotrophic C. reinhardtii cultures are less susceptible to photoinhibition than photoautotrophic cultures when subjected to high light. Spin-trapping electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that thylakoids from mixotrophic C. reinhardtii produced less (1)O2 than those from photoautotrophic cultures. The same was observed in vivo by measuring DanePy oxalate fluorescence quenching. Photoinhibition can be induced by the production of (1)O2 originating from charge recombination events in photosystem II, which are governed by the midpoint potentials (Em) of the quinone electron acceptors. Thermoluminescence indicated that the Em of the primary quinone acceptor (QA/QA(-)) of mixotrophic cells was stabilised while the Em of the secondary quinone acceptor (QB/QB(-)) was destabilised, therefore favouring direct non-radiative charge recombination events that do not lead to (1)O2 production. Acetate treatment of photosystem II-enriched membrane fragments from spinach led to the same thermoluminescence shifts as observed in C. reinhardtii, showing that acetate exhibits a direct effect on photosystem II independent from the metabolic state of a cell. A change in the environment of the non-heme iron of acetate-treated photosystem II particles was detected by low temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. We hypothesise that acetate replaces the bicarbonate associated to the non-heme iron and changes the environment of QA and QB affecting photosystem II charge recombination events and photoinhibition.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

None of the added amino  had any significant effect on the yeast cell count, pH, soluble solid contents, sugars and ethanol. The addition of L-phenylalanine significantly reduced the production of pyruvic and succinic . The addition of each amino acid dramatically reduced the consumption of proline and decreased the production of glycerol. Supplementation of the lychee juice with L-phenylalanine resulted in the formation of significantly higher amounts of 2-phenylethyl alcohol, 2-phenylethyl acetate, 2-phenylethyl isobutyrate and 2-phenylethyl hexanoate. In contrast, supplementation with L-tryptophan and  had negligible effects on the  profile of lychee wines.

In the present studies, in a dose-dependent fashion, neratinib reduced the expression levels of mutant K-RAS or of mutant N-RAS, which was augmented in an additive to greater than additive fashion by the HDAC inhibitors sodium valproate and AR42. Neratinib could reduce PDGFRα levels in GBM cells, that was enhanced by sodium valproate. Knock down of Beclin1 or of ATG5 prevented neratinib and neratinib combined with sodium valproate / AR42 from reducing the expression of mutant N-RAS in established PDX and fresh PDX models of ovarian cancer and melanoma, respectively. Neratinib and the drug combinations caused the co-localization of mutant RAS proteins and ERBB2 with Beclin1 and cathepsin B. The drug combination activated the AMP-dependent protein kinase that was causal in enhancing HMG Co A reductase phosphorylation.

It is generally accepted that the activity of  ammonia-lyase (TAL), which converts  to p-coumaric acid, represents the rate-limiting step. Therefore, an error-prone PCR-based random mutagenesis strategy was utilized for screening variants with higher catalytic activity. After rounds of screening, three variant enzymes were obtained, exhibiting improved production rates of 41.2, 37.1, and 38.0 %, respectively. Variants associated with increased expression level (S9N), improved catalytic efficiency (A11T), and enhanced affinity between TAL and  (E518V) were identified as beneficial amino acid substitutions by site-directed mutagenesis. Combining all of the beneficial amino acid substitutions, a variant, MT-S9N/-A11T/-E518V, exhibiting the highest catalytic activity was obtained. The K  value of MT-S9N/-A11T/-E518V decreased by 25.4 % compare to that of wild-type, while the activity, k /K , and p-coumaric-acid yield were improved by 36.5, 31.2, and 65.9 %, respectively. Furthermore, the secondary structure of the 5'-end of MT-S9N mRNA and the three-dimensional protein structure of MT-E518V were modeled. Therefore, two potential mechanisms were speculated: (1) a simplified mRNA 5'-end secondary structure promotes TAL expression and (2) anchoring the flexible loop region (Glu325-Arg336) to maintain the active-site pocket opening ensures easy access by the  to the active site and thus improves p-coumaric acid yields.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31352150>Novel insights into integrated fermentation and nitrogen removal by free nitrous acid (FNA) serving as treatment method.</a></h1><p>Free nitrous acid (FNA) has only been studied as the pretreatment of waste activated sludge (WAS). Integrated fermentation and nitrogen removal using FNA as a primary means of treatment are seldom investigated. WAS fermentation was characterized under various FNA concentration. The production of COD, protein, and carbohydrate increased with FNA concentration (in the range of 0.197-1.97 mg/L) before the denitrification process.  (VFA) were only produced after complete denitrification. Potential FNA impact on fermentation step found FNA facilitated both solubilization and hydrolysis but inhibited acidification, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis processes. The types of fermentation were determined using threedimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. Protein-like substances and /Tryptophan were the most dominant dissolved organic matters (DOMs). The cell decay rate increased from 0.044 to 0.102/d based on the nonlinear fitting for the FNA concentration of 0.197-1.97 mg/L. The microbial biomass mortality reached 92.7% when the FNA in tight extracellular polymeric substances (T-EPS) exceeded 0.04 mg/L. In addition, the microbial diversity and microbial structure were substantially reduced by FNA during long-term operation, while the bacterial abundance associated with hydrolysis and acidification increased significantly.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Valproic acid (VPA) is an anti-epileptic drug that also acts as a class I histone deacetylase inhibitor. The aim of this research was to determine the anti-leukemic effects of dasatinib and VPA in combination and to identify their mechanism of action in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Dasatinib was found to exert potent synergistic inhibitory effects on VPA-treated AML cells in association with G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction involving the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase-3, -7 and -9. Dasatinib/VPA-induced cell death thus occurred via caspase-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK inhibitors efficiently inhibited dasatinib/VPA-induced apoptosis. The combined effect of dasatinib and VPA on the differentiation capacity of AML cells was more powerful than the effect of each drug alone, being sufficiently strong to promote AML cell death through G1 cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis. MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK were found to control dasatinib/VPA-induced apoptosis as upstream regulators, and co-treatment with dasatinib and VPA to contribute to AML cell death through the regulation of differentiation capacity. Taken together, these results indicate that combined dasatinib and VPA treatment has a potential role in anti-leukemic therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25774002>Sodium Butyrate Ameliorates L-Arginine-Induced Pancreatitis and Associated Fibrosis in Wistar Rat: Role of Inflammation and Nitrosative Stress.</a></h1><p>Several reports indicated that histone deacetylases (HDACs) play a crucial role in inflammation and fibrogenesis. Sodium butyrate (SB) is a short-chain  acid having HDAC inhibition potential. The present study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of SB against L-arginine (L-Arg)-induced pancreatic fibrosis in Wistar rats. Pancreatic fibrosis was induced by twice intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 20% L-Arg (250 mg/100 g) at 2-h interval on day 1, 4, 7, and 10, whereas SB (800 mg/kg/day) was administrated for 10 days. At the end of the study, biochemical estimations, histological alterations, DNA damage, and the expression of various proteins were evaluated. Posttreatment of SB decreased L-Arg-induced oxidative and nitrosative stress, DNA damage, histological alterations, and fibrosis. Interestingly, posttreatment of SB significantly decreased the expression of α-smooth muscle actin, interleukin-1β, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and 3-nitrotyrosine.

Hence, the chemically diverse lignin monomers are valuable raw materials for fine chemicals, materials synthesis, and food and flavor industries. However, extensive use of this natural resource is hampered by the large number of different lignin monomers and the complex and irregular structure of lignin, which renders current processes for its chemical or enzymatic degradation inefficient.

The structural analysis according to CD method showed that the cadmium acetate binding altered HSA conformation with a major reduction of α-helix, inducing a partial protein unfolding. Synchronous fluorescence spectra suggested that cadmium acetate was situated closer to tryptophan residue compared to  residues, making tryptophan residue locate in a more hydrophobic environment. 3D fluorescence demonstrated that cadmium acetate could induce the HSA aggregation and cause a slight unfolding of the polypeptide backbone of the protein.© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28622455>Intestinal Metabolites Are Profoundly Altered in the Context of HLA-B27 Expression and Functionally Modulate Disease in a Rat Model of Spondyloarthritis.</a></h1><p>HLA-B27-associated spondyloarthritides are associated with an altered intestinal microbiota and bowel inflammation. We undertook this study to identify HLA-B27-dependent changes in both host and microbial metabolites in the HLA-B27/β -microglobulin (β m)-transgenic rat and to determine whether microbiota-derived metabolites could impact disease in this major model of spondyloarthritis.Cecal contents were collected from Fischer 344 33-3 HLA-B27/β m-transgenic rats and wild-type controls at 6 weeks (before disease) and 16 weeks (with active bowel inflammation). Metabolomic profiling was performed by high-throughput gas and liquid chromatography-based mass spectrometry. HLA-B27/β m-transgenic rats were treated with the microbial metabolites propionate or butyrate in drinking water for 10 weeks, and disease activity was subsequently assessed.Our screen identified 582 metabolites, of which more than half were significantly altered by HLA-B27 expression at 16 weeks. Both microbial and host metabolites were altered, with multiple pathways affected, including those for amino acid, carbohydrate, xenobiotic, and medium-chain  acid metabolism. Differences were even observed at 6 weeks, with up-regulation of histidine, , spermidine, N-acetylmuramate, and glycerate in HLA-B27/β m-transgenic rats. Administration of the short-chain  acid propionate significantly attenuated HLA-B27-associated inflammatory disease, although this was not associated with increased FoxP3+ T cell induction or with altered expression of the immunomodulatory cytokines interleukin-10 (IL-10) or IL-33 or of the tight junction protein zonula occludens 1. HLA-B27 expression was also associated with altered host expression of messenger RNA for the microbial metabolite receptors free  acid receptor 2 (FFAR2), FFAR3, and niacin receptor 1.HLA-B27 expression profoundly impacts the intestinal metabolome, with changes evident in rats even at age 6 weeks. Critically, we demonstrate that a microbial metabolite, propionate, attenuates development of HLA-B27-associated inflammatory disease.

Under the Cu stress and in the presence of J10, isolate S17 caused an elevation of the shoot fresh weight, K concentration, and TAL activity in the leaves, and APX and GPX (also at J1) activities in the roots. In the absence of Cu, isolate S17 increased the root length and the shoot-to-root ratio, but without statistical significance. In these conditions, S17 contributed to a 236% and 34% enhancement of P and Mn, respectively, in the roots, and a 19% rise of N in the leaves. Under the Cu stress, S17 caused a significant increase in FLAVO and TPC in the leaves. Similarly, the levels of FLAVO, TPC, and AC were enhanced after inoculation with Cu and J1. Regardless of the presence of J, inoculation at Cu excess caused a reduction of SOD and CAT activities, and an elevation of GPX. The effects of inoculation were associated with the application of Cu and J, which modified plant response mainly in a concentration-dependent manner (e.g., PAL, TAL, and LMWOA levels). The conducted studies demonstrated the potential for isolate S17 in the promotion of plant growth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25093777>Successful treatment of dopamine dysregulation syndrome with valproic acid.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28258324>One-step preparation of enantiopure L- or D-amino acid benzyl esters avoiding the use of banned solvents.</a></h1><p>The enantiomers of amino acid benzyl esters are very important synthetic intermediates. Many of them are currently prepared by treatment with benzyl alcohol and p-toluenesulfonic acid in refluxing benzene or carbon tetrachloride, to azeotropically remove water, and then precipitated as tosylate salt by adding diethyl ether.

The economic incentives for the production of raspberry ketone, combined with the very poor yields from plant tissue, therefore make this compound an excellent target for heterologous production in synthetically engineered microbial strains.A de novo pathway for the production of raspberry ketone was assembled using four heterologous genes, encoding phenylalanine/ ammonia lyase, cinnamate-4-hydroxlase, coumarate-CoA ligase and benzalacetone synthase, in an industrial strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Synthetic protein fusions were also explored as a means of increasing yields of the final product.The highest raspberry ketone concentration achieved in minimal media exceeded 7.5 mg/L when strains were fed with 3 mM p-coumaric acid; or 2.8 mg/L for complete de novo synthesis, both of which utilized a coumarate-CoA ligase, benzalacetone synthase synthetic fusion protein that increased yields over fivefold compared to the native enzymes. In addition, this strain was shown to be able to produce significant amounts of raspberry ketone in wine, with a raspberry ketone titer of 3.5 mg/L achieved after aerobic fermentation of Chardonnay juice or 0.68 mg/L under anaerobic winemaking conditions.We have shown that it is possible to produce sensorially-relevant quantities of raspberry ketone in an industrial heterologous host.

Since elicitors can be used to increase trans-R production, understanding the molecular mechanisms involved would improve the management of grapevine cells as factories of this compound. The results obtained in this study provide evidence for a role of Ca(2+) in mediating elicitor-induced trans-R production in grapevine SCC. The Ca(2+) elevation was promoted by an uptake of Ca(2+) from the extracellular medium, and by Ca(2+) mobilization from intracellular organelles. Moreover, protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events seem to be involved in the signal transduction pathways triggered by CDs separately or in combination with MJ since trans-R production is dependent on both, the phosphorylation status of several proteins through mitogen-activated kinase pathway and the activity of  phosphatases. Our results also suggest that H(2)O(2) and NO participated in the production of trans-R triggered by both elicitors in grapevine SCC. Finally, a fast alkalinization of the extracellular medium is induced in the presence of CDs and/or MJ.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

It can be inferred from the spectroscopic features of difference ellipticity signals and from CD displacement experiments that  residues located in subdomain IB are the source of the observed spectral alterations. It is proposed that inclusion of some ligand molecules (bile , dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, steroidal terpenes,  , ibuprofen, and gemfibrozil) into the pocket of subdomain IB disrupts the Tyr138-Tyr161 interhelical π-π stacking interaction, which is reflected in the CD spectrum.

In this study, we examined how PPARα activates NOS1. The NO production stimulated by GW7647 was suppressed by inhibitors of PI3K (wortmannin) and Akt (AKT 1/2 Kinase Inhibitor, AKT-inh), although it was also suppressed by the inhibitors of PPARα (GW6471) and NOS1 (N-PLA). GW7647 enhanced the ACh (acetylcholine)-stimulated exocytosis (Ca(2+)-regulated exocytosis) mediated via NO, which was abolished by GW6471, N-PLA, wortmannin, and AKT-inh. The Western blotting revealed that GW7647 phosphorylates NOS1 via phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt in antral mucous cells. The immunofluorescence examinations demonstrated that PPARα existing with NOS1 co-localizes with PI3K and Akt in the cytoplasm of antral mucous cells. ACh alone and AACOCF3, an analogue of arachidonic acid (AA), induced the NOS1 phosphorylation via PI3K/Akt to produce NO, which was inhibited by GW6471. Since AA is a natural ligand for PPARα, ACh stimulates PPARα probably via AA.

Notably, the human U251MG glioblastoma tumor line is the most sensitive, with an IC50 of 6.7 μM, compared with normal fibroblasts, which have an IC50 > 20 μM. Treatment of U251MG cells that harbor aberrantly active signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 3 with Cmpd1 suppresses Stat3 tyrosine705 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in parallel with the induction of pserine727 Stat3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 (pErk1/2(MAPK)). Inhibition of pErk1/2(MAPK) induction by the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 [2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one] blocked both the pserine727 Stat3 induction and ptyrosine705 Stat3 suppression by Cmpd1, indicating dependency on the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-Erk1/2(MAPK) pathway for Cmpd1-induced modulation of Stat3 signaling. Cmpd1 also blocked epidermal growth factor-stimulated pStat1 induction, whereas upregulating pSrc, pAkt, p-p38, pHeat shock protein 27, and pmammalian target of rapamycin levels. However, pJanus kinase 2 and pEpidermal growth factor receptor levels were not significantly altered. Treatment of U251MG cells with Cmpd1 reduced in vitro colony formation, induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and cleavage of caspases 3, 8, and 9 and poly(ADP ribose) polymerase, and suppressed survivin, myeloid cell leukemia 1, Bcl-xL, cyclin D1, and cyclin B1 expression. Taken together, these data identify a novel mechanism for the inhibition of Stat3 signaling by a resveratrol analog and suggest that the preferential growth inhibitory effects of Cmp1 occur in part by Erk1/2(MAPK)-dependent modulation of constitutively active Stat3.Copyright © 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28396925>Caffeic acid production by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of kraft pulp using recombinant Escherichia coli.</a></h1><p>Caffeic acid (3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid) serves as a building block for thermoplastics and a precursor for biologically active compounds and was recently produced from glucose by microbial fermentation. To produce caffeic acid from inedible cellulose, separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) reactions were compared using kraft pulp as lignocellulosic feedstock. Here, a -overproducing Escherichia coli strain was metabolically engineered to produce caffeic acid from glucose by introducing the genes encoding a 4-hydroxyphenyllactate 3-hydroxylase (hpaBC) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and  ammonia lyase (fevV) from Streptomyces sp. WK-5344. Using the resulting recombinant strain, the maximum yield of caffeic acid in SSF (233 mg/L) far exceeded that by SHF (37.9 mg/L). In the SSF with low cellulase loads (≤2.5 filter paper unit/g glucan), caffeic acid production was markedly increased, while almost no glucose accumulation was detected, indicating that the E. coli cells experienced glucose limitation in this culture condition. Caffeic acid yield was also negatively correlated with the glucose concentration in the fermentation medium. In SHF, the formation of by-product acetate and the accumulation of potential fermentation inhibitors increased significantly with kraft pulp hydrolysate than filter paper hydrolysate. The combination of these inhibitors had synergistic effects on caffeic acid fermentation at low concentrations. With lower loads of cellulase in SSF, less potential fermentation inhibitors (furfural, 5-hydroxymethyfurfural, and 4-hydroxylbenzoic acid) accumulated in the medium. These observations suggest that glucose limitation in SSF is crucial for improving caffeic acid yield, owing to reduced by-product formation and fermentation inhibitor accumulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24026435>Bioactive flavonoid p-hydroxycinnamic acid stimulates osteoblastogenesis and suppresses adipogenesis in bone marrow culture.</a></h1><p>The bioactive flavonoid p-hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA), which is an intermediate-metabolic substance in plants and fruits, is synthesized from . The biological effect of HCA is poorly understood. Among cinnamic acid and its related compounds, HCA has a specific-anabolic effect on bone, being found to stimulate osteoblastogenesis and to inhibit osteoclastogenesis through the suppression of NF-κB signaling, thereby preventing bone loss. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells give rise to ostoblasts and adipocytes. HCA might therefore have effects on osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis in bone marrow culture. This study demonstrates (1) that HCA has stimulatory effects on osteoblastogenesis and mineralization and suppressive effects on adipogenesis in mouse bone marrow culture and (2) that HCA depresses adipogenesis in mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in vitro.

Levodopa and carbidopa are small polar molecules, posing challenges in the development of selective and efficient chromatography conditions. Perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPA), a  ion-pairing agent, was utilized to enhance chromatographic characteristics of both compounds in the reversed-phase mechanism. The ion-pairing chromatography played an essential role in mitigating matrix effects and achieving adequate separation between interfering background peaks and those of the analytes of interest, especially for levodopa. A 96-well based, automated liquid-liquid extraction, via the use Hamilton NIMBUS liquid handlers, was developed. Butyl alcohol, when mixed with ethyl acetate, greatly increased the recovery of both levodopa and carbidopa. The addition of PFPA further enhanced recovery for both analytes. Sodium metabisulfite, an antioxidant, was used to stabilize levodopa and carbidopa in rat plasma. The method was validated in the ranges of 50-10,000ng/mL and 25-5000ng/mL for levodopa and carbidopa, respectively, using levodopa-d3 and carbidopa-d3 as internal standards.

Eleven patients were enrolled into an RP2D cohort. Blood samples were collected from all cohorts; CSF was collected at pharmacokinetic steady-state from RP2D patients. Tumor responses were assessed every 8 weeks per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.Fifty-four patients were enrolled (median age 60; range, 35-76 years). The most common diagnoses were cancers of the colon (28 %), breast (17 %), and pancreas (9 %). Escalation cohorts evaluated doses from 50 mg daily to 500 mg twice daily; the MTD/RP2D was 400 mg twice daily. Dose-limiting toxicities included diarrhea, hypokalemia, and fatigue.

This study aims to elucidate the neuroprotective effect of MK in rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease(PD) model in rats. Ninety six male rats were split into four groups: vehicle control (0.2 ml/kg/48 h, sc), MK (10 mg/kg/day, ip), rotenone (1.5 mg/kg/48 h, sc.) and rotenone pretreated with MK. Rotenone treatment led to significant reduction in motor functioning and elevation in oxidative stress markers. Additionally, upregulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and CysLT1 receptor expressions were anchored with enhanced striatal microglial activation generating a severe neuro-inflammatory milieu. Furthermore, an augmentation in p53 expression and cleaved caspases-3 activity increased apoptotic neurodegeneration synchronized with reduction of striatal  hydroxylase (TH) content. Changes in neuronal morphology was also noted. MK administration significantly mitigated motor impairment and rise in oxidative stress mediators. As well, the anti-inflammatory activity of MK was manifested by hindering the principal controller of inflammatory pathway, nuclear factor-kappa B, followed by its downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta), by attenuating striatal microglial activation and hampering the expression of both p38 MAPK and CysLT1. Moreover, MK revealed a decline in p53 expression with its downstream cleaved caspases-3 which resulted in preservation of striatal TH terminals as verified by increased striatal TH content and improvement in the histopathological changes incited by rotenone. In conclusion, MK endowed neuroprotective effects in rotenone-induced PD animal model via attenuation of microglial cell activation and p38 MAPK expression.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, Escherichia coli was engineered for the production of caffeic acid using  as the initial precursor of the pathway. The pathway design included  ammonia lyase (TAL) from Rhodotorula glutinis to convert  to p-coumaric acid and 4-coumarate 3-hydroxylase (C3H) from Saccharothrix espanaensis or cytochrome P450 CYP199A2 from Rhodopseudomonas palustris to convert p-coumaric acid to caffeic acid. The genes were codon-optimized and different combinations of plasmids were used to improve the titer of caffeic acid. TAL was able to efficiently convert 3mM of  to p-coumaric acid with the highest production obtained being 2.62mM (472mg/L). CYP199A2 exhibited higher catalytic activity towards p-coumaric acid than C3H. The highest caffeic acid production obtained using TAL and CYP199A2 and TAL and C3H was 1.56mM (280mg/L) and 1mM (180mg/L), respectively. This is the first study that shows caffeic acid production using CYP199A2 and  as the initial precursor.

However, research about the effect of elicitors on grape amino acid content is scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of foliar application of methyl jasmonate on must amino acid content. Results revealed that total amino acid content was not modified by the application of methyl jasmonate. However, the individual content of certain amino  was increased as consequence of methyl jasmonate foliar application, i.e., histidine, serine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, , asparagine, methionine, and lysine. Among them, phenylalanine content was considerably increased; this amino acid is precursor of phenolic and aromatic compounds. In conclusion, foliar application of methyl jasmonate improved must nitrogen composition.

Counter-regulatory hormones were analyzed in urine and plasma. Adrenal gene expression levels were evaluated and correlated to cecal short chain   () content.There was a significant association between absent microbiota/ and epinephrine levels at baseline and after stress.

Since antibiotic exposure can adversely affect the microbiome, we hypothesized that antibiotic effects on the gut microbiota and host metabolism are sex dependent. In this study, we examined the effects of antibiotic treatments, including vancomycin (Vanc) and ciprofloxacin-metronidazole (CiMe), on the gut microbiome and metabolome in colonic contents and tissues in both male and female mice. We found that the relative abundances and structural composition of  were significantly reduced in female mice after both Vanc and CiMe treatments but in male mice only after treatment with Vanc. However, Vanc exposure considerably altered the relative abundances and structural composition of representatives of the  especially in male mice. The levels of short-chain   (SCFAs; acetate, butyrate, and propionate) in colonic contents and tissues were significantly decreased in female mice after both antibiotic treatments, while these reductions were detected in male mice only after Vanc treatment. However, another , formate, exhibited the opposite tendency in colonic tissues. Both antibiotic exposures significantly decreased the levels of alanine, branched-chain amino  (BCAAs; leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and aromatic amino  (AAAs; phenylalanine and ) in colonic contents of female mice but not in male mice. Additionally, female mice had much greater correlations between microbe and metabolite than male mice. These findings suggest that sex-dependent effects should be considered for antibiotic-induced modifications of the gut microbiota and host metabolism. Accumulating evidence shows that the gut microbiota regulates host metabolism by producing a series of metabolites, such as amino , bile ,  , and others. These metabolites have a positive or negative effect on host health. Antibiotic exposure can disrupt the gut microbiota and thereby affect host metabolism and physiology. However, there are a limited number of studies addressing whether antibiotic effects on the gut microbiota and host metabolism are sex dependent. In this study, we uncovered a sex-dependent difference in antibiotic effects on the gut microbiota and metabolome in colonic contents and tissues in mice. These findings reveal that sex-dependent effects need to be considered for antibiotic use in scientific research or clinical practice.

In this study, we explored the effects of URB597 on oxidative damage to lipids and other major endpoints of toxicity in two neurotoxic models in vivo in rats (the first one produced by the mitochondrial neurotoxin 3-nitropropionic acid [3-NP], and the other generated by the striatal injection of the pro-oxidant toxin 6-hydroxidopamine [6-OHDA]) in order to provide further supporting evidence of its modulatory profile.Male Wistar adult rats were treated for 5 or 7 consecutive days with URB597 (0.3mg/kg, i.p.) and simultaneously exposed to three injections of 3-NP (30mg/kg, i.p.) or a single intrastriatal infusion of 6-OHDA (0.02mg/2μl), respectively. Twenty four hours after all treatments were administered, lipid peroxidation was measured in the striatum of 3-NP-treated rats, and in the midbrain of 6-OHDA-treated rats. Motor skills and histological assessment in the striatum were also evaluated in 3-NP-treated rats 6 and 7days after the last drug administration, respectively; whereas apomorphine-induced circling behavior and  hydroxylase immunolocalization in the striatum and substantia nigra were investigated 21 and 22days after the last drug infusion, respectively.URB597 prevented the oxidative damage to lipids induced by 3-NP in the striatum, and this effect could account for the attenuation of motor deficits in this model. Attenuation of motor disturbances induced by URB597 in both models was associated with the morphological preservation of the striatum in the 3-NP model and the partial preservation of  hydroxylase in the 6-OHDA model in the SNpc and striatum.The modulatory actions exerted by URB597 in both toxic models support its potential against toxic conditions implying motor and neurochemical alterations linked to energy depletion, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. Although most of these effects could be attributable to its action on FAAH and further AEA accumulation, in light of our present findings other properties are suggested.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Many of these secondary metabolites are already being used as active pharmaceutical or nutraceutical ingredients, and there are numerous exploratory studies of other compounds with promising applications. p-Coumaric acid is derived from aromatic amino  and, besides being a valuable chemical building block, it serves as precursor for biosynthesis of many secondary metabolites, such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and some polyketides. Here we developed a p-coumaric acid-overproducing Saccharomyces cerevisiae platform strain. First, we reduced by-product formation by knocking out phenylpyruvate decarboxylase ARO10 and pyruvate decarboxylase PDC5. Second, different versions of feedback-resistant DAHP synthase and chorismate mutase were overexpressed. Finally, we identified shikimate kinase as another important flux-controlling step in the aromatic amino acid pathway by overexpressing enzymes from Escherichia coli, homologous to the pentafunctional enzyme Aro1p and to the bifunctional chorismate synthase-flavin reductase Aro2p. The highest titer of p-coumaric acid of 1.93 ± 0.26 g L(-1) was obtained, when overexpressing  ammonia-lyase TAL from Flavobacterium johnsoniaeu, DAHP synthase ARO4(K229L), chorismate mutase ARO7(G141S) and E. coli shikimate kinase II (aroL) in Δpdc5Δaro10 strain background. To our knowledge this is the highest reported titer of an aromatic compound produced by yeast. The developed S. cerevisiae strain represents an attractive platform host for production of p-coumaric-acid derived secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids, polyphenols, and polyketides.Copyright © 2015 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

The expression levels of mRNAs and immune localization of the NT-3 protein and its receptor TrkC are altered in the striatum following damage induced by an in vivo treatment with 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), a mitochondrial toxin used to mimic the histopathological hallmarks of Huntington's disease (HD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of NT-3 on corticostriatal synaptic transmission and its plasticity in both the control and damaged striatum.Corticostriatal population spikes were electrophysiologically recorded and striatal synaptic plasticity was induced by high-frequency stimulation. Further, the phosphorylation status of Trk receptors was tested under conditions that imitated electrophysiological experiments.NT-3 modulates both synaptic transmission and plasticity in the striatum; nonetheless, synaptic plasticity was modified by the 3-NP treatment, where instead of producing striatal long-term depression (LTD), long-term potentiation (LTP) was obtained. Moreover, the administration of NT-3 in the recording bath restored the plasticity observed under control conditions (LTD) in this model of striatal degeneration.NT-3 modulates corticostriatal transmission through TrkB stimulation and restores striatal LTD by signaling through its TrkC receptor.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24249529>Valproate disturbs the balance between branched and aromatic amino  in rats.</a></h1><p>We investigated the effect of valproate (ip, 500 mg/kg), which is regarded as a potent plasma protein tryptophan (TRP) displacer, on the central nervous system (hippocampal) and peripheral (plasma) levels of the aromatic amino  (AAAs; e.g. TRP,  and phenylalanine) and branched-chain amino  (BCAAs; e.g. valine, isoleucine and leucine) as well as the other amino  (glutamate, GABA, alanine, glutamine, glycine, aspartate and taurine) involved in the regulation of neurotransmission. Furthermore, we investigated whether the changes in the BCAA/AAA ratio affected the hippocampal concentration of monoamines [serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA)]. Valproic acid (VPA) administration potently modified the balance between the BCAA and AAA. In the brain, the significantly increased AAA and decreased BCAA concentrations were followed by a decrease in the BCAA/AAA ratio. In the plasma, VPA significantly decreased the BCAA and AAA levels. The changes in the BCAA and AAA levels were accompanied by an increase in the NA, DA and 5-HT levels as well as hippocampal 5-HT metabolism. This novel finding indicates that VPA, through the displacement of TRP from its protein-binding sites, could disturb the BCAA/AAA ratio, with central nervous system consequences, including the possible contribution to VPAs effects in affective disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28689798>Ethyl acetate extract from Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer and its main constituents inhibit α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-induced melanogenesis by suppressing oxidative stress in B16 mouse melanoma cells.</a></h1><p>Hyperpigmentation disease involves darkening of the skin color due to melanin overproduction. Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine and has a long history of use as a skin lightener to inhibit melanin formation in China, Korea and some other Asian countries. However, the constituents and the molecular mechanisms by which they affect melanogenesis are not fully clear.The purpose of this study was to identify the active ingredient in Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer extract that inhibits mushroom tyrosinase activity and to investigate the antioxidative capacity and molecular mechanisms of the effective extract on melanogenesis in B16 mouse melanoma cells.Aqueous extracts of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer were successively fractionated with an equal volume of chloroform, ethyl acetate, and n-butyl alcohol to determine the effects by examining the activity of mushroom tyrosinase. The effective fraction was analyzed using HPLC and LC-MS. The antioxidative capacity and the inhibitory effects on melanin content, cell intracellular tyrosinase activity, and melanogenesis protein levels were determined in α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH)-treated B16 mouse melanoma cells.The ethyl acetate extract from Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (PG-2) had the highest inhibiting effect on mushroom tyrosinase, mainly contained phenolic , including protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, p-coumaric acid, salicylic acid, and caffeic acid, and exhibited apparent antioxidant activity in vitro. PG-2 and its main constituents significantly decreased melanin content, suppressed cellular tyrosinase activity, and reduced expression of tyrosinase protein to inhibit B16 cells melanogenesis induced by α-MSH, and no cytotoxic effects were observed. They also inhibited cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione (GSH) level in α-MSH-treated B16 cells effectively. And those activities of its main constituents could reach more than 80% of PG-2. The ROS scavengers N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) had a similar inhibitory effect on melanogenesis.These results suggest that ethyl acetate extract from Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer has the highest effect on inhibiting melanogenesis, and that its main components are polyphenolic compounds, which may inhibit melanogenesis by suppressing oxidative stress. This work provides new insight into the active constituents and molecular mechanisms underlying skin-lightening effect of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In the present study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of cyclohexanediol bis-ethylhexanoate (CHEH) on melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells and on UV-B-induced pigmentation in human skin. CHEH significantly reduced the melanin content in a dose-dependent manner, without cytotoxic effects at the effective concentrations. Moreover, CHEH dose-dependently inhibited tyrosinase activity in B16 melanoma cells, as confirmed by Western blot analysis of the tyrosinase protein levels. However, tyrosinase transcript levels remained unchanged under the same experimental conditions. These results indicate that CHEH inhibited melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells by regulating tyrosinase activity at the post-transcriptional level. On the other hand, in a cell-free system, CHEH did not inhibit tyrosinase activity. This indicated that CHEH suppressed the pigmentation of melanocytes by indirectly regulating tyrosinase activity. Finally, in a clinical trial, a cream containing 1.0% CHEH showed good whitening effect on UV-induced pigmented human skin without adverse effects. In conclusion, we suggest that CHEH may be an effective inhibitor of melanogenesis and useful effects in the treatment of hyperpigmented disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23339652>Specific and efficient N-propionylation of histones with propionic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester for histone marks characterization by LC-MS.</a></h1><p>Histones participate in epigenetic regulation via a variety of dynamic posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on them. Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a powerful tool to investigate histone PTMs. With the bottom-up mass spectrometry approach, chemical derivatization of histones with propionic anhydride or deuterated acetic anhydride followed by trypsin digestion was widely used to block the hydrophilic lysine residues and generate compatible peptides for LC-MS analysis. However, certain severe side reactions (such as acylation on  or serine) caused by acid anhydrides will lead to a number of analytical issues such as reducing results accuracy and impairing the reproducibility and sensitivity of MS analysis. As an alternative approach, we report a novel derivatization method that utilizes N-hydroxysuccinimide ester to specifically and efficiently derivatize both free and monomethylated amine groups in histones. A competitive inhibiting strategy was implemented in our method to effectively prevent the side reactions. We demonstrated that our method can achieve excellent specificity and efficiency for histones derivatization in a reproducible manner. Using this derivatization method, we succeeded to quantitatively profile the histone PTMs in KMS11 cell line with selective knock out of translocated NSD2 allele (TKO) and the original parental KMS11 cell lines (PAR) (NSD2, a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes the histone H3 K36 methylation), which revealed a significant crosstalk between H3 protein K27 methylation and adjacent K36 methylation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28381091>Differential Off-line LC-NMR (DOLC-NMR) Metabolomics To Monitor -Induced Metabolome Alterations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</a></h1><p>A novel differential off-line LC-NMR approach (DOLC-NMR) was developed to capture and quantify nutrient-induced metabolome alterations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Off-line coupling of HPLC separation and H NMR spectroscopy supported by automated comparative bucket analyses, followed by quantitative H NMR using ERETIC 2 (electronic reference to access in vivo concentrations), has been successfully used to quantitatively record changes in the metabolome of S. cerevisiae upon intervention with the aromatic amino acid . Among the 33 metabolites identified, glyceryl succinate, tyrosol acetate, tyrosol lactate, tyrosol succinate, and N-acyl- derivatives such as N-(1-oxooctyl)- are reported for the first time as yeast metabolites. Depending on the chain length, N-(1-oxooctyl)-, N-(1-oxodecanyl)-, N-(1-oxododecanyl)-, N-(1-oxomyristinyl)-, N-(1-oxopalmityl)-, and N-(1-oxooleoyl)- imparted a kokumi taste enhancement above their recognition thresholds ranging between 145 and 1432 μmol/L (model broth). Finally, carbon module labeling (CAMOLA) and carbon bond labeling (CABOLA) experiments with C-glucose as the carbon source confirmed the biosynthetic pathway leading to the key metabolites; for example, the aliphatic side chain of N-(1-oxooctyl)- could be shown to be generated via de novo  acid biosynthesis from four C-carbon modules (acetyl-CoA) originating from glucose.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25851105>On the interactions of leflunomide and teriflunomide within receptor cavity--NMR studies and energy calculations.</a></h1><p>Leflunomide is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug with antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive activity used for the treatment of psoriatic and rheumatoid arthritis. It undergoes rapid metabolization to teriflunomide, a metabolite that is responsible for the biological activity of leflunomide. Continuing our investigations on the interactions of biologically important azahetarenes with the environment, we focused on leflunomide and its active metabolite, teriflunomide, considering the interactions teriflunomide-amino acid within the target protein (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase) using density functional theory, as well as ONIOM techniques. The results of theoretical studies have shown that the interactions of teriflunomide with  and arginine involve principally the amide fragment of teriflunomide. The presence of the internal hydrogen bond between (Z)-teriflunomide carbonyl oxygen and enolic hydroxyl decreases the interaction strength between teriflunomide and  or arginine. Even the E isomer of teriflunomide would usually provide a stronger interaction teriflunomide-amino acid than the Z isomer with the internal hydrogen bond.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29845257>Montelukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist, inhibits the growth of chronic myeloid leukemia cells through apoptosis.</a></h1><p>The clinical outcome for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has improved significantly with the introduction of  kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, their curative potential appears limited, probably as a consequence of TKI-resistant leukemic stem cells (LSCs) that persist as a result of aberrant pathways independent of the well-established oncoprotein Bcr-Abl. One such pathway involves signaling through leukotrienes (LTs), bioactive compounds that have been suggested to play a role in several other malignancies. Cysteinyl LT1 receptor (CysLT1R) has been reported to be overexpressed in a number of solid cancers, and blocking of this receptor with the antagonist montelukast (treatment approved for bronchial asthma) has resulted in the killing of cancer cells. We recently demonstrated that montelukast, alone or in combination with imatinib, can effectively reduce the growth of CML cells, while normal bone marrow cells were left unaffected. Herein, we further investigated the importance of CysLT1R for the survival of CML cells and the mechanisms by which montelukast induces cell death. Knockdown of the CysLT1R of K562 cells with siRNA reduced their growth by 25%. Montelukast had no effect on these cells, while it killed more than 50% of CysLT1R-expressing cells. Growth inhibition exerted by imatinib was unaffected by CysLT1R status. Montelukast-induced killing of K562/JURL-MK1 CML cells was paralleled by Bax overexpression, cytochrome c release, PARP-1 cleavage, and caspase-3 activation, an event further increased in a setting where montelukast was added to imatinib. Wnt/β-catenin signaling was activated by CysLT1R and we observed that montelukast could induce proteins in this pathway, a finding of relevance for LSC survival. Thus, montelukast, employed at in vivo-like concentrations, induces the killing of CML cells through apoptotic pathways and may provide an additional, novel therapeutic possibility in CML.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495952>Histone acetylation and expression of mono-aminergic transmitters synthetases involved in CUS-induced depressive rats.</a></h1><p>Histone acetylation has been linked to depression, the etiology of which involves many factors such as genetics, environments, and epigenetics. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether it was associated with epigenetic histone modification and gene expression of enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of norepinephrine and serotonin in rat depression model induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to CUS over 28 days. It was shown that the CUS-induced rats displayed remarked anxiety- and depression-like behavior with weakened locomotor activity in open field test and prolonged immobility in forced swimming test. Western blot revealed that CUS led to significant decrease in acetylation of H3 at Lysine 9 (K9) and H4 at Lysine 12 (K12) with obviously increasing histone deacetylases 5 (HDAC5) expression in hippocampus of CUS-induced rats. Meanwhile, there was an obviously decreased expression of  hydroxylase (TH) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) both at protein and mRNA levels. Administration of sodium valproate (VPA), a histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) inhibitor, not only significantly relieved the anxiety- and depression-like behaviors of CUS-induced rats but also clearly blunted decrease of H3(K9) and H4(K12) acetylation and expression of TH and TPH, and prevented increase of HDAC5 expression. The results indicate that there exists possible interrelation between TH and TPH gene expression and epigenetic histone acetylation in CUS-induced depressive rats, which at least partly contributes to the etiology of depression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26116555>The Syk Inhibitor Fostamatinib Decreases the Severity of Colonic Mucosal Damage in a Rodent Model of Colitis.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal system. In some cases, current medications used for inflammatory bowel disease may not be enough for remission, creating a need for more potent and reliable medications. There is no study showing the efficacy of fostamatinib, with proven effects on some inflammatory diseases, on ulcerative colitis. In our study we planned to research the efficacy of fostamatinib, a spleen  kinase inhibitor, on acetic acid-induced colitis.The study included 28 male Sprague-Dawley rats, randomly divided into control group, fostamatinib group, colitis group and fostamatinib + colitis group, each containing seven rats. Colitis induction was performed with 4% acetic acid. Colonic inflammation was assessed with disease activity index, macroscopic and histological damage scores, colonic myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase activity, and tumour necrosis factor alpha [TNFα], CD3, Syk, and phospho-Syk expression.There was a significant difference between the colitis and control groups in terms of all parameters. The disease activity index, macroscopic and microscopic damage scores, immunohistochemical TNFα, CD3, Syk, and phospho-Syk expression, and tissue myeloperoxidase activity were found to be significantly lower in the colitis + fostamatinib group compared with the colitis group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde activity.Fostamatinib reduced the inflammatory damage in the experimental colitis. This effect may be due to suppression of TNFα, T-lymphocytes, and neutrophils in colonic mucosa via suppression of Syk. Fostamatinib may be an appropriate treatment alternative for ulcerative colitis.

Skeels (Phyllanthaceae) has traditionally been used to treat gastric trouble, rheumatism, bronchitis, asthma, respiratory disorders, and hepatitis. Despite this widespread use, the pharmacological activities of this plant and their molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Therefore, we evaluated the immunopharmacological activities of the methanolic extract of the aerial parts of this plant (Pa-ME) and validated its pharmacological targets.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated macrophages, an HCl/EtOH-induced gastritis model, and an acetic acid-injected capillary permeability mouse model were employed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of Pa-ME. Potentially active anti-inflammatory components of this extract were identified by HPLC. The molecular mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory activity were studied by kinase assays, reporter gene assays, immunoprecipitation analysis, and overexpression of target enzymes.Pa-ME suppressed the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prevented morphological changes in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, both HCl/EtOH-induced gastric damage and acetic acid-triggered vascular permeability were restored by orally administered Pa-ME. Furthermore, this extract downregulated the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and reduced the nuclear levels of NF-κB. Signalling events upstream of NF-κB translocation, such as phosphorylation of Src and Syk and formation of Src/Syk signalling complexes, were also inhibited by Pa-ME. The enzymatic activities of Src and Syk were also suppressed by Pa-ME. Moreover, Src-induced and Syk-induced luciferase activity and p85/Akt phosphorylation were also inhibited by Pa-ME. Of the identified flavonoids, kaempferol and quercetin were revealed as partially active anti-inflammatory components in Pa-ME.Pa-ME exerts anti-inflammatory activity in vitro and in vivo by suppressing Src, Syk, and their downstream transcription factor, NF-κB.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Mice with CKD exhibit increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and kidney histopathology. XOS significantly reverses kidney injuries in CKD mice. Analysis of cecum microbiota reveales that adenine-induced CKD does not change alpha diversity, and XOS induces a decrease of alpha diversity in control mice and mice with CKD. Beta diversity analysis shows significant clustering according to experimental groups. Six out of the nine bacterial genera enriched in CKD are significantly reduced with XOS intervention. Furthermore, XOS increases cecal short-chain  acid () production in both control and CKD mice. Cecal SCFAs and blood propionate are negatively correlated with BUN. XOS also decreases blood p-cresol sulfate in CKD mice, likely resulting from altered microbial  metabolism.These results show that XOS intervention improves kidney function in mice with CKD, and is associated with profound changes in microbial composition and metabolism.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, ~30-40% of patients develop resistance to imatinib therapy. Although most resistance is caused by mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain, 50-85% of these patients develop resistance in the absence of new mutations. In these cases, targeting other pathways may be needed to regain clinical response. Using label-free Raman spectromicroscopy, we evaluated a number of leukemia cell lines and discovered an aberrant accumulation of cholesteryl ester (CE) in CML, which was found to be a result of BCR-ABL kinase activity. CE accumulation in CML was found to be a cancer-specific phenomenon as untransformed cells did not accumulate CE. Blocking cholesterol esterification with avasimibe, a potent inhibitor of acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT-1), significantly suppressed CML cell proliferation in Ba/F3 cells with the BCR-ABLT315I mutation and in K562 cells rendered imatinib resistant without mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain (K562R cells). Furthermore, the combination of avasimibe and imatinib caused a profound synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation in K562R cells, but not in Ba/F3T315I. This synergistic effect was confirmed in a K562R xenograft mouse model. Analysis of primary cells from a BCR-ABL mutation-independent imatinib resistant patient by mass cytometry suggested that the synergy may be due to downregulation of the MAPK pathway by avasimibe, which sensitized the CML cells to imatinib treatment. Collectively, these data demonstrate a novel strategy for overcoming BCR-ABL mutation-independent TKI resistance in CML.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23809370>NSAID, aspirin delays gastric ulcer healing with reduced accumulation of CXCR4(+)VEGFR1(+) cells to the ulcer granulation tissues.</a></h1><p>Ulcer healing is a complex process, which involves cell migration, proliferation, angiogenesis and re-epithelialization. Several growth factors have been implicated in this process but the precise mechanism is not well understood. This study examined the involvement of VEGFR1 signaling in the gastric ulcer healing.Gastric ulcers were induced by the serosal application of 100% acetic acid, and the areas of the ulcers were measured thereafter.The healing of acetic acid induced ulcers and the progenitor cells expressing CXCR4(+)VEGFR1(+) cell were significantly delayed in NSAID treated mice. The areas of the ulcer was significantly suppressed in  kinase-deficient VEGFR1 mice (VEGFR1TKKO) compared with wild type (WT) mice. The plasma level of SDF-1 and stem cell factor (SCF) and bone marrow level of pro-matrix metallopeptidase 9 (pro-MMP-9) were significantly reduced in VEGFR1TKKO mice. In VEGFR1 TKKOmice, the progenitor cells expressing CXCR4(+)VEGFR1(+) cell from bone marrow and the recruitment of these cells in healing ulcer were suppressed. Furthermore, VEGFR1 TKKO mice treated with NSAID did not suppress gastric ulcer healing compared to vehicle mice. These results suggested that NSAID suppressed VEGFR1 TK signaling plays a critical role in ulcer healing through mobilization of CXCR4(+)VEGFR1(+) cells.VEGFR1 signaling is required for healing of NSAID induced gastric ulcer and angiogenesis with increased recruitment of CXCR4(+)VEGFR1(+) cells to the ulcerative lesion.Copyright © 2013.

Metabolic alterations have been involved in tumor progression and attracted interest as a target for therapeutic intervention. However, few studies analyzed the adaptations of cellular metabolism in the context of FLT3/ITD mutation. Here, we report that FLT3/ITD causes a significant increase in aerobic glycolysis through AKT-mediated upregulation of mitochondrial hexokinase (HK2), and renders the leukemia cells highly dependent on glycolysis and sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of glycolytic activity. Inhibition of glycolysis preferentially causes severe ATP depletion and massive cell death in FLT3/ITD leukemia cells. Glycolytic inhibitors significantly enhances the cytotoxicity induced by FLT3  kinase inhibitor sorafenib. Importantly, such combination provides substantial therapeutic benefit in a murine model bearing FLT3/ITD leukemia. Our study suggests that FLT3/ITD mutation promotes Warburg effect, and such metabolic alteration can be exploited to develop effective therapeutic strategy for treatment of AML with FLT3/ITD mutation via metabolic intervention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27065136>Effect of ruminal ammonia supply on lysine utilization by growing steers.</a></h1><p>Six ruminally cannulated Holstein steers (202 ± 15 kg) were used to study the effects of ruminal ammonia loading on whole-body lysine (Lys) utilization. Steers were housed in metabolism crates and used in a 6 × 6 Latin square design. All steers received 2.52 kg DM/d of a diet (10.1% CP) containing 82% soybean hulls, 8% wheat straw, 5% cane molasses, and 5% vitamins and minerals, and 10 g/d of urea (considered to be part of the basal diet) was ruminally infused continuously to ensure adequate ruminal ammonia concentrations. All steers were ruminally infused continuously with 200 g/d of acetic acid, 200 g/d of propionic acid, and 50 g/d of butyric acid and abomasally infused with 300 g/d of glucose continuously to increase energy supply without increasing microbial protein supply. Steers were also abomasally infused continuously with an excess of all essential AA except Lys to ensure that Lys was the only limiting AA. Treatments were arranged as a 3 × 2 factorial with 3 levels of urea (0, 40, or 80 g/d) continuously infused ruminally to induce ammonia loading and 2 levels of Lys (0 or 6 g/d) continuously infused abomasally. Treatments did not affect fecal N output ( = 0.37). Lysine supplementation decreased ( < 0.01) urinary N excretion from 51.9 g/d to 44.3 g/d, increased ( < 0.01) retained N from 24.8 to 33.8 g/d, increased ( < 0.01) plasma Lys, and decreased ( ≤ 0.05) plasma serine, , valine, leucine, and phenylalanine. Lysine supplementation also tended ( = 0.09) to reduce plasma urea-N. Urea infusions linearly increased ( = 0.05) retained N (27.1, 29.3, and 31.5 g/d) and also linearly increased ( < 0.01) urinary N excretion (31.8, 48.1, and 64.4 g/d), urinary urea (21.9, 37.7, and 54.3 g/d), urinary ammonia (1.1, 1.4, and 1.9 g/d), and plasma urea (2.7, 4.0, and 5.1 mM), and linearly decreased plasma alanine ( = 0.04) and plasma glycine ( < 0.01). Assuming that retained protein is 6.25 × retained N and contains 6.4% Lys, the incremental efficiencies of infused Lys utilization were 51%, 59%, and 69% for steers receiving 0, 40, and 80 g/d of urea, respectively, indicating that ruminal ammonia loads may improve the efficiency of Lys utilization. This is supported by observed increases in whole body-protein deposition in response to ammonia loading of our steers that were, by design, Lys deficient.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681632>New insight into chemical changes of dissolved organic matter during anaerobic digestion of dewatered sewage sludge using EEM-PARAFAC and two-dimensional FTIR correlation spectroscopy.</a></h1><p>Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a key component in reaction network of anaerobic digestion. In this study, fluorescent excitation-emission matrix-parallel factor (EEM-PARAFAC) analysis and two-dimensional (2D) FTIR correlation spectroscopy were firstly used to explore chemical changes of soluble intermediates in high-solid biogas reactor. EEM-PARAFAC showed that fluorescent components (-like, tryptophan-like and humic-like groups) in DOM over time increased gradually, implying that these groups were reluctant to biodegrade (acidogenesis). The resistance to biodegradation presented the following order: humic-like group>-like group>tryptophan-like group. 2D FTIR correlation spectroscopy indicated that the DOM change sequence with time followed the order: protein-like groups>structural carbohydrates and carboxylic >polysaccharides-like groups. Fluorescence intensities from EEM-PARAFAC and main bands of FTIR spectra correlated significantly with other chemical parameters, e.g. biogas production and dissolved organic carbon content. These findings supply novel realization for degradation degree and order of individual DOMs during anaerobic digestion for dewatered sewage sludge.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, drug response of clinical  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to the mutation was profiled using a synthetic biology protocol. It was found that TKIs can be grouped into three classes in terms of their response behavior to T798M mutation: class I inhibitors exhibit drug resistance upon the mutation, such as lapatinib, TAK-285 and AEE788; class II inhibitors are insensitive to the mutation, such as erlotinib and gefitinib; and class III inhibitors can be sensitized by the mutation, such as staurosporine. However, kinetic study indicated that the mutation has only a modest effect on the binding of substrate ATP to HER2. Binding free energy analysis revealed that the drug response is primarily determined by direct interaction between the kinase and inhibitors, but not by indirect kinase interaction with competitive ATP. This is different to the molecular mechanism of "generic" drug resistance conferring from EGFR gatekeeper T790M mutation, which is caused by increased ATP affinity upon the mutation. Structural analysis of kinase-inhibitor complexes unraveled that HER2 T798M mutation induces significant steric hindrance to class I inhibitors, but can establish additional nonbonded interactions for class III inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23154768>Silver-enhanced in situ hybridization for determination of EGFR copy number alterations in non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h1><p>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation and high gene copy number (CN) predict response to EGFR  kinase inhibitor therapy in the adenocarcinoma subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aims of this study were first to compare automated enzyme metallographic silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH) with conventionally used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the determination of EGFR CN in NSCLC tissue sections, and second to assess the association of EGFR CN with EGFR mutations and clinicopathological parameters. FISH and SISH were performed on tissue microarrays and large sections. Samples from 56 consecutively surgically resected NSCLC patients (cohort 1) and from 60 selected lung adenocarcinoma patients (cohort 2) were analyzed. EGFR CN was classified applying the Colorado criteria, and agreement between both methods was evaluated using κ values. EGFR CN was compared with EGFR protein expression and EGFR gene mutations. The results of SISH and FISH were identical in 114 of the 116 cases examined using the 2 techniques. One case was FISH+, SISH-, and 1 case was FISH- and SISH+. The agreement between the 2 methods was good in cohort 1 (κ=0.642 [0.428, 0.823]) and excellent in cohort 2 (κ=0.963 [0.870, 1.000]). EGFR positivity by FISH and SISH was associated with high EGFR protein expression (P<0.001) and EGFR mutation (P<0.001). These results validate the use of SISH for assessing EGFR CN alterations in NSCLC. The advantage of a permanent result and the possibility of bright-field microscopy make SISH an attractive alternative to FISH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088374>Comparative transcriptome analyses of genes involved in sulforaphane metabolism at different treatment in Chinese kale using full-length transcriptome sequencing.</a></h1><p>Sulforaphane is a natural isothiocyanate available from cruciferous vegetables with multiple characteristics including antioxidant, antitumor and anti-inflammatory effect. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing has been used for long-read de novo assembly of plant genome. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism related to glucosinolates biosynthesis in Chinese kale using combined NGS and SMRT sequencing.SMRT sequencing produced 185,134 unigenes, higher than 129,325 in next-generation sequencing (NGS). NaCl (75 mM), methyl jasmonate (MeJA, 40 μM), selenate (Se, sodium selenite 100 μM), and brassinolide (BR, 1.5 μM) treatment induced 6893, 13,287, 13,659 and 11,041 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Chinese kale seedlings comparing with control. These genes were associated with pathways of glucosinolates biosynthesis, including phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and glucosinolate biosynthesis. We found NaCl decreased sulforaphane and glucosinolates (indolic and aliphatic) contents and downregulated expression of cytochrome P45083b1 (CYP83b1), S-alkyl-thiohydroximatelyase or carbon-sulfur lyase (SUR1) and UDP-glycosyltransferase 74B1 (UGT74b1). MeJA increased sulforaphane and glucosinolates contents and upregulated the expression of CYP83b1, SUR1 and UGT74b1; Se increased sulforaphane; BR increased expression of CYP83b1, SUR1 and UGT74b1, and increased glucosinolates contents. The desulfoglucosinolate sulfotransferases ST5a_b_c were decreased by all treatments.We confirmed that NaCl inhibited the biosynthesis of both indolic and aliphatic glucosinolates, while MeJA and BR increased them. MeJA and BR treatments, conferred the biosynthesis of glucosinolates, and Se and MeJA contributed to sulforaphane in Chinese kale via regulating the expression of CYP83b1, SUR1 and UGT74b1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23201076>The effect of oxidative stress upon the intestinal epithelial uptake of butyrate.</a></h1><p>Our aim was to investigate the effect of oxidative stress upon butyrate uptake at the intestinal epithelial level. For this, IEC-6 cells were treated with tert-butylhydroperoxide 3000μM (tBOOH), which increased levels of oxidative stress biomarkers, while maintaining cellular viability. The effect of tBOOH upon uptake of [(14)C]butyrate ([(14)C]BT) (10μM) can be summarized as follows: (a) it caused a reduction in the intracellular accumulation of [(14)C]BT over time, (b) it strongly reduced total [(14)C]BT uptake but did not affect Na(+)-independent uptake of [(14)C]BT, and (c) it did not affect the kinetics of [(14)C]BT uptake at 37°C, but increased uptake at 4°C. Moreover, tBOOH increased the efflux of [(14)C]BT not mediated by breast cancer resistance protein. We thus conclude that tBOOH strongly inhibits Na(+)-coupled monocarboxylate cotransporter 1 (SMCT1)-mediated, but not H(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transporter (MCT1)-mediated butyrate uptake; moreover, it increases uptake and efflux of butyrate by passive diffusion. tBOOH did not affect the mRNA expression levels of MCT1 and SMCT1 nor their cell membrane insertion. Rather, its effect was dependent on extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 and protein  kinase activation and on the generation of reactive oxygen species by NADPH and xanthine oxidases and was partially prevented by the polyphenols quercetin and resveratrol. In conclusion, tBOOH is an effective inhibitor of SMCT1-mediated butyrate transport in non-tumoral intestinal epithelial cells. Given the important role played by butyrate in the intestine, this mechanism may contribute to the procarcinogenic and proinflammatory effect of oxidative stress at this level.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It was reported that chemicals in the nasal cavity directly reach the brain through the connection between olfactory neurons and the olfactory bulb (OB). In this 'olfactory transport,' xenobiotics absorbed at the nasal mucosa reach the brain by bypassing some physical barriers and defenses, and thus olfactory transport is suspected to be a vulnerable mechanism of the brain against invasion threats of environmental chemicals. In this study, we focused on the neuronal toxicity of rotenone administered intranasally to mice. The results showed that the mice that were administered rotenone had attenuated olfactory functions. We also found that intranasally administered rotenone induced acute mitochondrial stress at the OB. The repeated administration of rotenone resulted in a decrease in the number of dopaminergic neurons, which are inhibitory interneurons in the OB. Taken together, our findings suggest that the inhalation of environmental toxins induces the neurodegeneration of cranial neurons through olfactory transport, and that olfactory dysfunction may be induced as an earliest symptom of neurodegeneration caused by inhaled neurotoxins.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a relatively easy-to-collect specimen that can provide important information about neurological health and function, proving its importance as both a diagnostic and biomedical monitoring tool. Consequently, it would be of high scientific interest and value to obtain more standard physiological information regarding its composition and dynamics for both swine pathology and the refinement of experimental protocols. Recently, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy has been applied in order to analyze the metabolomic profile of this biological fluid, and results showed the technique to be highly reproducible and reliable. The aim of the present study was to investigate in both qualitative and quantitative manner the composition of Cerebrospinal Fluid harvested form healthy newborn (5 days old-P5) and young (30-P30 and 50-P50 days old) piglets using 1H NMR Spectroscopy, and to analyze any possible difference in metabolites concentration between age groups, related to age and Blood-Brain-Barrier maturation. On each of the analyzed samples, 30 molecules could be observed above their limit of quantification, accounting for 95-98% of the total area of the spectra. The concentrations of adenine, , leucine, valine, 3-hydroxyvalerate, 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate were found to decrease between P05 and P50, while the concentrations of glutamine, creatinine, methanol, trimethylamine and myo-inositol were found to increase. The P05-P30 comparison was also significant for glutamine, creatinine, adenine, , leucine, valine, 3-hydroxyisovalerate, 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate, while for the P30-P50 comparison we found significant differences for glutamine, myo-inositol, leucine and trimethylamine. None of these molecules showed at P30 concentrations outside the P05 -P50 range.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708996>Regulation of alkaline ceramidase activity by the c-Src-mediated pathway.</a></h1><p>Ceramidase hydrolyzes ceramide to   and sphingosine, and sphingosine is then converted to sphingosine-1-phosphate. Ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate act as signaling molecules. Although stimuli coupling to protein kinases-dependent systems have been shown to regulate ceramidase activity, the exact role of c-Src-mediated signal has not been elucidated. We examined the effects of the downregulation of c-Src activity and c-Src overexpression on ceramidase activity in cells. In A549, CHO, and HeLa cells labeled with a fluorescent ceramide, 4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-labeled C6-ceramide (NBD-ceramide), the downregulation of c-Src by c-Src-shRNA and pharmacological inhibitors including SU6656 decreased levels of NBD-caproic acid. The overexpression of c-Src increased NBD-caproic acid levels in CHO and HeLa cells. Similar results were obtained in Na3VO4-treated cells having higher NBD-caproic acid levels. The downregulation and overexpression of c-Src decreased and increased ceramidase activity, respectively, in the lysates of A549 cells at pH 8.8. The ceramidase sensitivity to substrates, pH, and Ca(2+) suggest that the c-Src- and SU6656-sensitive ceramidase is alkaline ceramidase (ACER), possibly Ca(2+)-activated ACER2. Serum starvation increased both ceramidase activity at pH 8.8 and expression of ACER2. Our data suggest that c-Src-mediated signal positively regulates ACER activity in a Ca(2+)-independent manner.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We focus on these kinds of events involved in JAK-STAT signal pathways, especially the ones triggered by aberrant activated STAT3, an oncoprotein which participates in essential processes of cell survival, growth and proliferation in many types of tumors, as well as immune diseases. By establishing a STAT3 signal based high-throughput drug screening system in human lung cancer A549 cells, we have screened a library from natural products which contained purified compounds from medicinal herbs. One compound, named Brevilin A, exhibited both strong STAT3 signal inhibition and STAT3 signal dependent cell growth inhibition. Further investigations revealed that Brevilin A not only inhibits STAT3 signaling but also STAT1 signaling for cytokines induced phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT1 as well as the expression of their target genes. In addition, we found Brevilin A could attenuate the JAKs activity by blocking the JAKs  kinase domain JH1. The levels of cytokine induced phosphorylation of STATs and other substrates were dramatically reduced by treatment of Brevilin A. The roles of Brevilin A targeting on JAKs activity indicate that Brevilin A may not only be used as a STAT3 inhibitor but also a compound blocking other JAK-STAT hyperactivation. Thus, these findings provided a strong impetus for the development of selective JAK-STAT inhibitors and therapeutic drugs in order to improve survival of patients with hyperactivated JAKs and STATs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29242276>Oral sodium butyrate impacts brain metabolism and hippocampal neurogenesis, with limited effects on gut anatomy and function in pigs.</a></h1><p>Butyrate can improve gut functions, whereas histone deacetylase inhibitors might alleviate neurocognitive alterations. Our aim was to assess whether oral butyrate could modulate brain metabolism and plasticity and if this would relate to gut function. Sixteen pigs were subjected to sodium butyrate (SB) supplementation via beverage water or water only [control (C)]. All pigs had blood sampled after 2 and 3 wk of treatment, and were subjected to a brain positron emission tomography after 3 wk. Animals were euthanized after 4 wk to sample pancreas, intestine, and brain for gut physiology and anatomy measurements, as well as hippocampal histology, Ki67, and doublecortin (DCX) immunohistochemistry. SB compared with C treatment triggered basal brain glucose metabolism changes in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus ( P = 0.003), increased hippocampal granular cell layer volume ( P = 0.006), and neurogenesis (Ki67: P = 0.026; DCX: P = 0.029). After 2 wk of treatment, plasma levels of glucose, insulin, lactate, glucagon-like peptide 1, and peptide   remained unchanged. After 3 wk, plasma levels of lactate were lower in SB compared with C animals ( P = 0.028), with no difference for glucose and insulin. Butyrate intake impacted very little gut anatomy and function. These results demonstrate that oral SB impacted brain functions with little effects on the gut.-Val-Laillet, D., Guérin, S., Coquery, N., Nogret, I., Formal, M., Romé, V., Le Normand, L., Meurice, P., Randuineau, G., Guilloteau, P., Malbert, C.-H., Parnet, P., Lallès, J.-P., Segain, J.-P.

Although leflunomide is thought to act through the inhibition of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis, the molecular mechanism of the drug remains largely unknown. We investigated the antiarthritis effects and mechanisms of action of the active metabolite of leflunomide, A77 1726, in interleukin-1 receptor antagonist-knockout (IL-1Ra-KO) mice.14- to 15-week-old male IL-1Ra-KO mice were treated with 10 or 30 mg/kg A77 1726 via intraperitoneal injection three times per week for 6 weeks. The effects of A77 1726 on arthritis severities were assessed by clinical scoring and histological analysis. The serum concentrations of IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and malondialdehyde were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Histologic analysis of the joints was performed using Safranin O, and immunohistochemical staining. The frequencies of interleukin-17-producing CD4 T (Th17) cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in splenic CD4 T cells isolated from A77 1726-treated arthritis mice were assessed by western blotting.A77 1726 treatment induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in Jurkat cells and primary mouse T cells. Interestingly, A77 1726 inhibited Th17 cell differentiation. In vivo, A77 1726 reduced the clinical arthritis severity of histological inflammation and cartilage destruction. The joints isolated from A77 1726-treated mice showed decreased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, nitrotyrosine, TNF-α, and IL-1β. The serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and malondialdehyde were also decreased in A77 1726-treated mice. Whereas the number of Th17 cells in spleens was decreased in A77 1726-treated arthritis mice, a significant increase in the number of Treg cells in spleens was observed. Interestingly, HO-1 expression was significantly higher in splenic CD4 T cells isolated from A77 1726-treated mice compared with those from vehicle-treated mice, whereas HO-1 expression of splenic non-CD4 T cells did not differ between groups.The inhibitory effects of A77 1726 on joint inflammation and oxidative stress in autoimmune arthritis may be associated with HO-1 induction in CD4 T cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28928030>The histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate protects against noise-induced hearing loss in Guinea pigs.</a></h1><p>Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) severely impacts the quality of life of affected individuals. Oxidative stress resulting from noise exposure is a significant cause of NIHL. Although histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors were shown to protect against NIHL, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, and it is not known how they act on noise-induced oxidative stress. In the current study, we investigated the expression levels of acetyl-histone H3 (Lys9) (H3-AcK9), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), an oxidative stress marker, in a guinea pig model of NIHL using immunohistology and Western blotting. We then assessed the effects of systemic administration of the HDAC inhibitor, sodium butyrate (SB), on noise-induced permanent threshold shifts (PTS), hair cell (HC) loss, and changes in the above mentioned markers. The results showed that SB attenuated noise-induced PTS and outer hair cell loss. SB treatment promoted H3-AcK9 expression and repressed HDAC1 expression in the nuclei of HCs and Hensen's cells after noise exposure. Furthermore, SB attenuated the noise-induced increase of 3-NT expression in HCs and Hensen's cells. These findings suggest that SB protects against NIHL by reversing the noise-induced histone acetylation imbalance and inhibiting oxidative stress in cochlear HCs and Hensen's cells. SB treatment may represent a potential strategy to prevent and treat NIHL.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Excessively activated microglia produce several pro-inflammatory enzymes and pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to damage to surrounding neurons and eventually inducing neurodegeneration. Therefore, the inhibition of microglial overactivation may be a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent the further progression of PD. β-Hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) has been shown to suppress lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in BV-2 cells and to protect dopaminergic neurons in previous studies, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Thus, in this study, we further investigated this mechanism in LPS-induced in vivo and in vitro PD models.For the in vitro experiments, primary mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures were pretreated with BHBA and stimulated with LPS. [(3)H]dopamine (DA) uptake,  hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-ir) neurons and morphological analysis were evaluated and analyzed in primary mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures. In vivo, microglial activation and the injury of dopaminergic neurons were induced by LPS intranigral injection, and the effects of BHBA treatment on microglial activation and the survival ratio and function of dopaminergic neurons were investigated. Four our in vitro mechanistic experiment, primary microglial cells were pretreated with BHBA and stimulated with LPS; the cells were then assessed for the responses of pro-inflammatory enzymes and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the NF-κB signaling pathway was evaluated and analyzed.We found that BHBA concentration-dependently attenuated the LPS-induced decrease in [(3)H]DA uptake and loss of TH-ir neurons in the primary mesencephalic neuron/glia mixed culture. BHBA treatment significantly improved the motor dysfunction of the PD model rats induced by intranigral injection of LPS, and this beneficial effect of BHBA was attributed to the inhibition of microglial overactivation and the protection of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Our in vitro mechanistic study revealed that the inhibitory effect of BHBA on microglia was mediated by G-protein-coupled receptor 109A (GPR109A) and involved the NF-κB signaling pathway, causing the inhibition of pro-inflammatory enzyme (iNOS and COX-2) and pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) production.In conclusion, the present study supports the effectiveness of BHBA in protecting dopaminergic neurons against inflammatory challenge.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24279396>Effects of amino acid derivatives on physical, mental, and physiological activities.</a></h1><p>Nutritional ergogenic aids have been in use for a long time to enhance exercise and sports performance. Dietary components that exhibit ergogenic activity are numerous and their consumption is common and popular among athletes. They often come under scrutiny by legal authorities for their claimed benefits and safety concerns. Amino acid derivatives are propagated as being effective aids to enhance physical and mental performance in many ways, even though studies have pointed out that individuals who are deficient are more likely to benefit from dietary supplementation of amino acid derivatives than normal humans. In this review, some of the most common and widely used amino  derivatives in sports and athletics namely creatine, , carnitine, HMB, and taurine have been discussed for their effects on exercise performance, mental activity as well as body strength and composition. Creatine, carnitine, HMB, and taurine are reported to delay the onset of fatigue, improve exercise performance, and body strength. HMB helps in increasing fat-free mass and reduce exercise induced muscle injury. Taurine has been found to reduce oxidative stress during exercise and also act as an antihypertensive agent. Although, studies have not been able to find any favorable effect of  administration on exercise performance, it has been proved to be very effective in fighting stress, improving mood and cognitive performance particularly in sleep-deprived subjects. While available data from published studies and findings are equivocal about the efficacy of creatine, , and HMB, more comprehensive researches on carnitine and taurine are necessary to provide evidence for the theoretical basis of their ergogenic role in nutritional modification and supplementation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29847132>Microcystins Containing Doubly Homologated  Residues from a Microcystis aeruginosa Bloom: Structures and Cytotoxicity.</a></h1><p>Four new microcystin congeners are described including the first three examples of microcystins containing the rare doubly homologated  residue 2-amino-5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (Ahppa) (1-4). Large-scale harvesting and biomass processing allowed the isolation of substantial quantities of these compounds, thus enabling complete structure determination by NMR as well as cytotoxicity evaluation against selected cancer cell lines. The new Ahppa-toxins all incorporate Ahppa residues at the 2-position, and one of these also has a second Ahppa at position 4. The two most lipophilic Ahppa-containing microcystins showed 10-fold greater cytotoxic potency against human tumor cell lines (A549 and HCT-116) compared to microcystin-LR (5). The presence of an Ahppa residue in microcystin congeners is difficult to ascertain by MS methods alone, due to the lack of characteristic fragment ions derived from the doubly homologated side chain.

Here, we investigated the neuroprotective effect and potential mechanisms of NaB in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD). A mouse was intraperitoneally treated with MPTP (30mg/kg) for 7 consecutive days to induce PD model and NaB (200mg/kg) was intragastrically treated for 3weeks. The behavioral tests were then conducted. Dopaminergic degeneration was evaluated by western blot and immunohistochemistry of  hydroxylase (TH) in the SN. Brain damage was assessed by histologic (Nissl staining for cell death), apoptosis-associated protein and tight junction (TJ) proteins studies. Meanwhile, the levels of colonic glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and cerebral GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) expression were assessed. Our results showed that NaB improved neurobehavioral impairment including cognitive behavior and coordination performance. Moreover, NaB treatment prevented the MPTP-induced dopaminergic degeneration and decreased expression level of TH in the striatum. NaB treatment attenuated the PD-associated disruption of BBB by upregulation of Occludin and zonula occludens (ZO)-1. In addition, NaB resulted in increased level of Bcl-2 and decreased level of Bax. Particularly, NaB-treated mice with PD exhibited increased colonic GLP-1 level as well as upregulation of brain GLP-1R expression compared with PD group. Our findings suggest that NaB has potential as a novel therapeutic for treatment of PD, and its mechanism was associated with stimulating colonic GLP-1secretion.Copyright © 2017.

However, chemical synthesis of pHCA is both costly and harmful to the environment. Although pHCA production using microbes has been widely studied, there remains a need for more cost-effective methods, such as the use of biomass as a carbon source. In this study, we produced pHCA using  ammonia lyase-expressing Streptomyces lividans. In order to improve pHCA productivity from cellulose, we constructed a  ammonia lyase- and endoglucanase (EG)-expressing S. lividans transformant and used it to produce pHCA from cellulose.A Streptomyces lividans transformant was constructed to express  ammonia lyase derived from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RsTAL). The transformant produced 786 or 736 mg/L of pHCA after 7 days of cultivation in medium containing 1% glucose or cellobiose as the carbon source, respectively. To enhance pHCA production from phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC), we introduced the gene encoding EG into RsTAL-expressing S. lividans. After 7 days of cultivation, this transformant produced 753, 743, or 500 mg/L of pHCA from 1% glucose, cellobiose, or PASC, respectively.RsTAL-expressing S. lividans can produce pHCA from glucose and cellobiose. Similarly, RsTAL- and EG-expressing S. lividans can produce pHCA from glucose and cellobiose with excess EG activity remaining in the supernatant. This transformant demonstrated improved pHCA production from cellulose. Further enhancements in the cellulose degradation capability of the transformant will be necessary in order to achieve further improvements in pHCA production from cellulose.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23215980>Evaluation of osteoconductive scaffolds in the canine femoral multi-defect model.</a></h1><p>Treatment of large segmental bone defects remains an unsolved clinical challenge, despite a wide array of existing bone graft materials. This project was designed to rapidly assess and compare promising biodegradable osteoconductive scaffolds for use in the systematic development of new bone regeneration methodologies that combine scaffolds, sources of osteogenic cells, and bioactive scaffold modifications. Promising biomaterials and scaffold fabrication methods were identified in laboratories at Rutgers, MIT, Integra Life Sciences, and Mayo Clinic. Scaffolds were fabricated from various materials, including poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), poly(L-lactide-co-ɛ-caprolactone) (PLCL), -derived polycarbonate (TyrPC), and poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF). Highly porous three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds were fabricated by 3D printing, laser stereolithography, or solvent casting followed by porogen leaching. The canine femoral multi-defect model was used to systematically compare scaffold performance and enable selection of the most promising substrate(s) on which to add cell sourcing options and bioactive surface modifications. Mineralized cancellous allograft (MCA) was used to provide a comparative reference to the current clinical standard for osteoconductive scaffolds. Percent bone volume within the defect was assessed 4 weeks after implantation using both MicroCT and limited histomorphometry. Bone formed at the periphery of all scaffolds with varying levels of radial ingrowth. MCA produced a rapid and advanced stage of bone formation and remodeling throughout the defect in 4 weeks, greatly exceeding the performance of all polymer scaffolds. Two scaffold constructs, TyrPC(PL)/TCP and PPF4(SLA)/HA(PLGA) (Dip), proved to be significantly better than alternative PLGA and PLCL scaffolds, justifying further development. MCA remains the current standard for osteoconductive scaffolds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28841695>Earwax metabolomics: An innovative pilot metabolic profiling study for assessing metabolic changes in ewes during periparturition period.</a></h1><p>Important metabolic changes occur during transition period of late pregnancy and early lactation to meet increasing energy demands of the growing fetus and for milk production. The aim of this investigation is to present an innovative and non-invasive tool using ewe earwax sample analysis to assess the metabolic profile in ewes during late pregnancy and early lactation. In this work, earwax samples were collected from 28 healthy Brazilian Santa Inês ewes divided into 3 sub-groups: 9 non-pregnant ewes, 6 pregnant ewes in the last 30 days of gestation, and 13 lactating ewes ≤ 30 days postpartum. Then, a range of metabolites including  organic compounds (VOC), amino  (AA), and minerals were profiled and quantified in the samples by applying headspace gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry, respectively. As evident in our results, significant changes were observed in the metabolite profile of earwax between the studied groups where a remarkable elevation was detected in the levels of non-esterified  , alcohols, ketones, and hydroxy urea in the VOC profile of samples obtained from pregnant and lactating ewes. Meanwhile, a significant decrease was detected in the levels of 9 minerals and 14 AA including essential AA (leucine, phenyl alanine, lysine, isoleucine, threonine, valine), conditionally essential AA (arginine, glycine, , proline, serine), and a non-essential AA (alanine). Multivariate analysis using robust principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis was successfully applied to discriminate the three study groups using the variations of metabolites in the two stress states (pregnancy and lactation) from the healthy non-stress condition. The innovative developed method was successful in evaluating pre- and post-parturient metabolic changes using earwax and can in the future be applied to recognize markers for diagnosis, prevention, and intervention of pregnancy complications in ewes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26333151>Quantitation of phenylpropanoids and iridoids in insulin-sensitising extracts of Leonurus sibiricus L. (Lamiaceae).</a></h1><p>Leonurus sibiricus L. is regularly used in traditional Mongolian medicine including for the treatment of symptoms of diabetes mellitus.To provide a validated quantitation method for the quality control of Leonurus sibiricus and to prove in vitro insulin-sensitisation, thereby supporting the traditional use of Leonurus sibiricus.Pulverised Leonurus sibiricus material was either extracted with methanol or methanol:water (25:75, v/v). HPLC-CAD (charged aerosol detector) separations were performed on a Luna Phenyl-Hexyl column with water and acetonitrile (both modified with 0.1% formic acid) as mobile phase. Gradient elution was employed using theophylline as internal standard. Tentative peak identification was facilitated by HPLC-MS. Validation was carried out according to ICH (International Conference on Harmonisation) guidelines. Potential insulin-sensitisation of accordant extracts was assessed in glucose uptake experiments in C2C12 myocytes and protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) enzyme assays.Thirty-six compounds were tentatively identified based on their retention times, UV spectra, MS fragments and data from literature. They comprise phenolcarboxylic , flavonoids, iridoid glycosides, and phenylpropanoids, among which acetylharpagide, ajugoside, lavandulifolioside, and verbascoside were selected for quantitation. The methanol extract contained 0.42% combined iridoids, and 1.58% combined phenylpropanoids. Validation showed good accuracy, intermediate precision and robustness. The methanol extract of Leonurus sibiricus led to a 1.5 fold increase in insulin-stimulated cellular glucose uptake and inhibition of PTP1B by 40% at a concentration of 10 µg/mL.HPLC-CAD analysis allowed sensitive quantitation of the selected marker compounds in Leonurus sibiricus, thereby providing a reliable tool for its quality control.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24919713>A771726, an anti-inflammatory drug, exerts an anticancer effect and reverses tamoxifen resistance in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells.</a></h1><p>A771726, an orally available anti-inflammatory agent, has been approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by diminishing entire inflammatory responses through multiple signaling pathways. Recently, a few emerging studies have focused on the potential application of A771726 in cancer therapy, less on the treatment of breast cancer and particularly on overcoming drug resistance in breast cancer. We report here for the first time the cytotoxic activity and drug resistance reversal of A771726 in acquired tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell line MCF-7/LCC9. We discovered that A771726 treatment showed antiproliferative activities in MCF-7/LCC9 cells, which were even more sensitive to A771726 than their parental tamoxifen-sensitive cells (MCF‑7). A771726 also exerted pro-apoptotic activities and induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. Notably, treatment of A771726 restored the sensitivity of MCF-7/LCC9 cells to tamoxifen. Western blot analysis revealed that A771726 decreased the phosphorylation level of Src, one key driver of tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, in order to comprehensively clarify the mechanisms of A771726 in anti-estrogen-resistant cells, we explored a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis, and showed that A771726 could modulate multiple signaling pathways (e.g. cell cycle, apoptosis, MAPK, metabolism and p53 signaling pathway) and cellular processes (e.g. signal transduction, transcription and cell cycle). Overall, our results indicate that A771726 alone and the combination of A771726 with anti-estrogens may be of therapeutic benefit for ER-positive and endocrine-resistant breast cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25170769>Enteric bacterial metabolites propionic and butyric acid modulate gene expression, including CREB-dependent catecholaminergic neurotransmission, in PC12 cells--possible relevance to autism spectrum disorders.</a></h1><p>Alterations in gut microbiome composition have an emerging role in health and disease including brain function and behavior. Short chain   () like propionic (PPA), and butyric acid (BA), which are present in diet and are fermentation products of many gastrointestinal bacteria, are showing increasing importance in host health, but also may be environmental contributors in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Further to this we have shown  administration to rodents over a variety of routes (intracerebroventricular, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal) or developmental time periods can elicit behavioral, electrophysiological, neuropathological and biochemical effects consistent with findings in ASD patients.  are capable of altering host gene expression, partly due to their histone deacetylase inhibitor activity. We have previously shown BA can regulate  hydroxylase (TH) mRNA levels in a PC12 cell model. Since monoamine concentration is known to be elevated in the brain and blood of ASD patients and in many ASD animal models, we hypothesized that  may directly influence brain monoaminergic pathways. When PC12 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids having a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the TH promoter, PPA was found to induce reporter gene activity over a wide concentration range. CREB transcription factor(s) was necessary for the transcriptional activation of TH gene by PPA. At lower concentrations PPA also caused accumulation of TH mRNA and protein, indicative of increased cell capacity to produce catecholamines. PPA and BA induced broad alterations in gene expression including neurotransmitter systems, neuronal cell adhesion molecules, inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function, all of which have been implicated in ASD. In conclusion, our data are consistent with a molecular mechanism through which gut related environmental signals such as increased levels of 's can epigenetically modulate cell function further supporting their role as environmental contributors to ASD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28867722>The Standardized Extract of Juniperus communis Alleviates Hyperpigmentation in Vivo HRM-2 Hairless Mice and in Vitro Murine B16 Melanoma Cells.</a></h1><p>In European folk medicine, the fruits of Juniperus communis are used in the treatment of skin-related disorders such as skin infection, itching, and psoriasis. Previously, we reported that the EtOAc fraction of J. communis (EAJC) contained tyrosinase inhibition properties in vitro non-cellular experiment. The aim of this study was to evaluate anti-melanogenic effect of standardized EAJC on a hyperpigmentation animal model. Therapeutic effects of EAJC toward skin hyperpigmentation were confirmed by both in vivo experiment and in vitro cell-based assay. Skin depigmenting effect was detected by topical treatment of EAJC for 11 d to HRM-2 melanin-possessing hairless mice. Histologic findings including significantly decreased melanin depositions could be observed in dorsal skin samples of EAJC-treated group. In addition, the EAJC (50 µg/mL) attenuated melanin production through down-regulation of tyrosinase activity and protein expression in B16 murine melanoma cells. According to the phytochemical analysis, EAJC was found to contain hypolaetin-7-O-β-D-xylopyranoside and isoscutellarein-7-O-β-D-xylopyranoside as main components. Hypolaetin-7-O-β-D-xylopyranoside was responsible for the skin-lightening effect of EAJC by reducing the number of melanocytes in dorsal skins of HRM-2 mice. The present study provided direct experimental evidence for skin-lightening effect of EAJC in UV-irradiated hairless mouse model. Therapeutic attempts with the J. communis might be useful in the management of skin pigmentation-related diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31421510>The characterization of dissolved organic matter in alkaline fermentation of sewage sludge with different pH for  production.</a></h1><p>Sewage sludge (SS) alkaline fermentation (especially at pH 10) can efficiently enhance  (VFAs) production. VFAs are considered an excellent carbon source for the biological nutrient removal (BNR) process. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in fermentation liquid is the direct substrate used for producing VFAs and can greatly influence the effluent quality of BNR process. However, knowledge of DOM characteristics in sludge alkaline fermentation is limited. This study focused on the functional groups, fluorescent components and molecular features of DOM as well as molecular weight of proteins in SS alkaline fermentation (at pH uncontrolled, 7, 8, 9 and 10). Results showed a significantly improved generation of tryptophan-like and -like substances as well as molecular weight <1 kDa proteins (381.5 ± 38.4 mg/L) was observed at pH 10 (p < 0.05). Further analysis of DOM molecular characteristics indicated that pH 10 resulted in the highest molecular diversity and the generation or degradation of easily biodegradable lipid-like and proteins/amino sugars-like formulas. The improved solubilization of DOM contributed to VFAs production. Meanwhile, increasing pH to 10 also promoted the release of hard-biodegradable organic matter, e.g., humic-like and lignin-like substances. Additionally, a high diversity of resistant N-containing organic molecules was generated at pH 10. Fermentation of SS at pH 10, is favored to enhance VFAs production and, can also result in a higher content of refractory DOM. This study helps to achieve a comprehensive understanding of SS alkaline fermentation and provides fundamental information for further treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Montelukast, which plays an anti-inflammatory role, is used to treat patients with asthma. In addition, recent studies have reported that its administration could reduce neuroinflammatory activities, showing beneficial effects against various neuropathological conditions. These results suggest that montelukast may be a useful drug to alleviate inflammatory responses in PD, even though there are no reports showing its beneficial effects against neurotoxicity in the nigrostriatal DA system. In the present study, our results showed that treatment with montelukast could protect DA neurons against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neurotoxicity and its administration significantly attenuated the production of neurotoxic cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) from activated microglia in the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum following 6-OHDA treatment. Therefore, we suggest that montelukast can be used as a potential inhibitor of microglial activation to protect DA neurons in the adult brain against PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23595514>Platelet recruitment to venous stent thrombi.</a></h1><p>Thrombosis following venous stent placement is a morbid clinical outcome. Whether to target platelets or coagulation factors for venous stent thromboprophylaxis remains unclear. We sought to determine whether integrin α(IIb)β3 antagonism with lamifiban would inhibit platelet recruitment to venous stent thrombosis. Anti-thrombotic efficacy was compared between venous and arterial circulations. Pigs received either lamifiban (0.2 mg/kg bolus plus 0.2 mg/kg/h infusion; n = 6) or saline (n = 12). Carotid arteries were crush injured and then harvested 30 min later to provide an assessment of antithrombotic efficacy in the arterial circulation. Iliac venous stents were then deployed and thrombi allowed to propagate for 2 h before harvesting. Platelet deposition was measured by scintillation detection of autologous (111)In-platelets. Venous thrombi were quantified by weight and compared to platelet, Von Willebrand factor (VWF) and fibrinogen content. Arterial platelet deposition (×10(6)/cm(2)) was reduced >80% by lamifiban (398 ± 437) compared to controls (1,540 ± 883; p < 0.005). Lamifiban also reduced venous thrombus platelet deposition (139 ± 88 vs. 281 ± 167) however did not prevent thrombosis. In control animals, venous stent platelet deposition correlated with plasma fibrinogen content (R(2) = 0.29; p = 0.03). Fibrinogen content correlated directly with venous stent platelet deposition (p = 0.03) but not thrombus weight. Neither venous platelet deposition nor thrombus weights varied by VWF content. Platelet recruitment to venous stent thrombi occurs in part through the integrin α(IIb)β3 receptor. Unlike arterial thrombosis, inhibition of this receptor is insufficient to prevent venous stent thrombosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30260985>Cilostazol disrupts TLR-4, Akt/GSK-3β/CREB, and IL-6/JAK-2/STAT-3/SOCS-3 crosstalk in a rat model of Huntington's disease.</a></h1><p>Countless neurodegenerative diseases are associated with perverse multiple targets of cyclic nucleotide signalling, hastening neuronal death. Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective effects against sundry models of neurotoxicity, however, its role against Huntington's disease (HD) has not yet been tackled. Hence, its modulatory effect on several signalling pathways using the 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) model was conducted. Animals were injected with 3-NP (10 mg/kg/day, i.p) for two successive weeks with or without the administration of cilostazol (100 mg/kg/day, p.o.). Contrary to the 3-NP effects, cilostazol largely preserved striatal dopaminergic neurons, improved motor coordination, and enhanced the immunohistochemical reaction of  hydroxylase enzyme. The anti-inflammatory effect of cilostazol was documented by the pronounced reduction of the toll like receptor-4 (TLR-4) protein expression and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, but with a marked elevation in IL-10 striatal contents. As a consequence, cilostazol reduced IL-6 downstream signal, where it promoted the level of suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3), while abated the phosphorylation of Janus Kinase 2 (JAK-2) and Signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT-3). Phosphorylation of the protein kinase B/glycogen synthase kinase-3β/cAMP response element binding protein (Akt/GSK-3β/CREB) cue is another signalling pathway that was modulated by cilostazol to further signify its anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic capacities. The latter was associated with a reduction in the caspase-3 expression assessed by immunohistochemical assay. In conclusion the present study provided a new insight into the possible mechanisms by which cilostazol possesses neuroprotective properties. These intersecting mechanisms involve the interference between TLR-4, IL-6-IL-10/JAK-2/STAT-3/SOCS-3, and Akt/GSK-3β/CREB signalling pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28054346>Optimized logic rules reveal interferon-γ-induced modes regulated by histone deacetylases and protein  phosphatases.</a></h1><p>The pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is critical for activating innate and adaptive immunity against tumours and intracellular pathogens. Interferon-γ is secreted at the fetal-maternal interface in pregnant women and mice. The outer layer of the placenta in contact with maternal blood is composed of semi-allogeneic trophoblast cells, which constitute the fetal component of the fetal-maternal interface. The simultaneous presence of pro-inflammatory IFN-γ and trophoblast cells at the fetal-maternal interface appears to represent an immunological paradox, for trophoblastic responses to IFN-γ could potentially lead to activation of maternal immunity and subsequent attack of the placenta. However, our previous studies demonstrate that IFN-γ responsive gene (IRG) expression is negatively regulated in human and mouse trophoblast cells. In human cytotrophoblast and trophoblast-derived choriocarcinoma cells, janus kinase signalling is blocked by protein  phosphatases (PTPs), whereas in mouse trophoblast, histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibit IRG expression. Here, we used genome-wide transcriptional profiling to investigate the collective roles of PTPs and HDACs on regulation of IRG expression in human choriocarcinoma cells. Logic-rules were optimized to derive regulatory modes governing gene expression patterns observed upon different combinations of treatment with PTP and HDAC inhibitors. The results demonstrate that IRGs can be divided into several categories in human choriocarcinoma cells, each of which is subject to distinct mechanisms of repression. Hence, the regulatory modes identified in this study suggest that human trophoblast and choriocarcinoma cells may evade the potentially deleterious consequences of exposure to IFN-γ by using several overlapping mechanisms to block IRG expression.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28982156>Postprandial PYY increase by resistant starch supplementation is independent of net portal appearance of short-chain   in pigs.</a></h1><p>Increased dietary fiber (DF) fermentation and short-chain  acid () production may stimulate peptide - (PYY) secretion. In this study, the effects of hindgut  production on postprandial PYY plasma levels were assessed using different experimental diets in a porto-arterial catheterized pig model. The pigs were fed experimental diets varying in source and levels of DF for one week in 3×3 Latin square designs. The DF sources were whole-wheat grain, wheat aleurone, rye aleurone-rich flour, rye flakes, and resistant starch. Postprandial blood samples were collected from the catheters and analyzed for PYY levels and net portal appearance (NPA) of PYY was correlated to NPA of . No significant effects of diets on NPA of PYY were observed (P > 0.05), however, resistant starch supplementation increased postprandial NPA of PYY levels by 37 to 54% compared with rye-based and Western-style control diets (P = 0.19). This increase was caused by higher mesenteric artery and portal vein PYY plasma levels (P < 0.001) and was independent of  absorption (P > 0.05). The PYY levels were higher in response to the second daily meal compared with the first daily meal (P < 0.001), but similar among diets (P > 0.10). In conclusion, the increased postprandial PYY responses in pigs fed with different levels and sources of DF are not caused by an increased  absorption and suggest that other mechanisms such as neural reflexes and possibly an increased flow of digesta in the small intestine may be involved. The content of DF and  production did not affect PYY levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29481896>Zinc as a therapy in a rat model of autism prenatally induced by valproic acid.</a></h1><p>Autism is characterized by numerous behavioral impairments, such as in communication, socialization and cognition. Recent studies have suggested that valproic acid (VPA), an anti-epileptic drug with teratogenic activity, is related to autism. In rodents, VPA exposure during pregnancy induces autistic-like effects. Exposure to VPA may alter zinc metabolism resulting in a transient deficiency of zinc. Therefore, we selected zinc as a prenatal treatment to prevent VPA-induced impairments in a rat model of autism. Wistar female rats received either saline solution or VPA (400 mg/kg, i.p) on gestational day (GD) 12.5. To test the zinc supplementation effect, after 1 h of treatment with saline or VPA, a dose of zinc (2 mg/kg, s.c.) was injected. The offspring were tested for abnormal communication behaviors with an ultrasound vocalization task on postnatal day (PND) 11, repetitive behaviors and cognitive ability with a T-maze task on PND 29, and social interaction with a play behavior task on PND 30.  hydroxylase protein (TH) expression was evaluated in the striatum. Prenatal VPA decreased ultrasonic vocalization, induced repetitive/restricted behaviors and cognitive inflexibility, impaired socialization, and reduced striatal TH levels compared with control group. Zinc treatment reduced VPA-induced autistic-like behaviors. However, we found no evidence of an effect of zinc on the VPA-induced reduction in TH expression. The persistence of low TH expression in the VPA-Zn group suggests that Zn-induced behavioral improvement in autistic rats may not depend on TH activity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Long-distance transportation negatively impacts production and health of cattle, which may, at least partly, result from the disturbance of metabolism during and after transportation. However, alteration of metabolism remains elusive in transported cattle. We investigated the effects of transportation on the metabolomic profiles of Holstein steer calves. Non-targeted analysis of serum concentrations of low molecular weight metabolites was performed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Transportation affected 38 metabolites in the serum. A pathway analysis suggested that 26, 10, and 10 pathways were affected immediately after transportation, and 3 and 7 days after transportation, respectively. Some pathways were disturbed only immediately after transportation, likely because of feed and water withdrawal during transit. Nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, and citric acid cycle were affected for 3 days after transportation, whereas propionate metabolism, phenylalanine and  metabolism were affected throughout the experiment. Four pathways were not affected immediately after transportation, but were altered thereafter. These results suggested that many metabolic pathways had marked perturbations during transportation. Metabolites such as citric acid, propionate,  and niacin can be candidate supplements for mitigating transportation-induced adverse effects.© 2017 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30201376>Selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α modulator K-877 regulates the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 in pancreatic beta cells.</a></h1><p>ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) protein is a pivotal regulator of cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from cells to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Pancreatic ABCA1 functions in beta cell cholesterol homeostasis and affects insulin secretion. We investigated the effect of pemafibrate (K-877), a novel selective PPARα modulator (SPPARMα), on pancreatic ABCA1 expression. In vivo experiment, mice were divided into four treatment groups, namely, normal food plus placebo, high fat diet (HFD) plus placebo, normal food plus K-877 (0.3 mg/kg/day), or HFD plus K-877 (0.3 mg/kg/day), and treated for eight weeks. The results in vitro experiment indicate that K-877 treatment increased levels of ABCA1 mRNA, as well as protein, subsequently reduced the cellular cholesterol content in INS-1 cells. PPARα specific antagonist GW6471 attenuate K-877 induced ABCA1 expression in INS-1 cells. ABCA1 promoter activity increased with K-877 treatment at concentration 1 μM and 10 μM. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was ameliorated by K-877 treatment in INS-1 cells and isolated mouse islets. Although the expression of ABCA1 was reduced in mice with HFD treatment, both ABCA1 protein and mRNA levels were increased in mice with K-877 treatment. K-877 treatment improved glucose intolerance induced by HFD in mice. These findings raise the possibility that K-877 may affect insulin secretion by controlling ABCA1 expression in pancreatic beta cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Experimental rats were induced by high fat diet feeding coupled with combined exposure to streptozotocin and nicotinamide. Treatment with EAF improved glucose tolerance and lipid profiles, but the insulin secretion was unaltered. Gene expression analyses on insulin/adipocytokine signalling-related genes demonstrated tissue-specific transcriptional responses. In skeletal muscle and liver tissues, Socs1, Tnf and Mapk8 showed consistent transcript regulation. Furthermore, hepatic translational analyses revealed sensitization on proximal insulin signalling, with reduced expression of IRS1 serine phosphorylation, increased IRS1  phosphorylation and increased phospho-AKT (Ser473). The present findings suggested that EAF exerted its effect by modulating insulin signalling, potentially via IRS1/AKT activation.

Recent research also revealed several pharmacological activities from many groups of secondary metabolites, including the stilbenoids mulberroside A, oxyresveratrol, and resveratrol, which are promising compounds for cosmetic and herbal supplement products. In our previous study, cell cultures of M. alba showed high productivity of these compounds. In this study, we attempted to develop immobilized cell cultures of M. alba and to test the effect of elicitors and precursors on the production of stilbenoids. The immobilization of the M. alba cells significantly promoted the secretion of mulberroside A into the extracellular matrix and culture media to 60%, while enhancing the level of oxyresveratrol and resveratrol by 12- and 27-fold, respectively. The elicitation of immobilized cells with a combination of 50 µM methyl jasmonate and 0.5 mg/mL yeast extract for 24 h promoted a twofold increase in the production of all three stilbenoids. Furthermore, the addition of 0.05 mM L-phenylalanine, 0.03 mM , or a combination resulted in the enhancement of mulberroside A production for up to twofold. The addition of  significantly enhanced the production of oxyresveratrol and resveratrol. This is the first report of stilbenoid production using immobilized cell cultures of M. alba. The cultures have benefits over normal cell suspension cultures by promoting the secretion of mulberroside A and enhancing the levels of oxyresveratrol and resveratrol.

Although chemically analog to  kinase inhibitors, there is little information regarding its biological actions. Here, we aimed at assessing the MC effects on gastrointestinal contractility and the putative involvement of  kinase in the mediation of these effects. Isometric contractions were recorded in rat isolated strips from stomach, duodenum and colon segments. In gastric strips, MC (3-3000 µM) showed antispasmodic effects against carbachol-induced contractions, which remained unchanged by either l-NAME or tetraethylammonium pretreatment and occurred with potency similar to that obtained against contractions evoked by potassium or U-46619. In colon strips, MC was four times more potent than in gastric ones. MC and the positive control genistein inhibited phasic contractions induced by acetylcholine in Ca2+-free medium, an effect fully prevented by sodium orthovanadate. Both MC and genistein decreased the spontaneous contractions of duodenal strips and shortened the time necessary for gastric fundic tissues to reach 50% of maximal relaxation. In freshly isolated colon myocytes, MC decreased the basal levels of cytoplasmic Ca2+, but not the potassium-elicited cytoplasmic Ca2+ elevation. Colon strips obtained from rats subjected to intracolonic acetic acid instillation showed reduced contractility to potassium, which was partially recovered in MC-treated rats. Inhibitory effect of nifedipine against cholinergic contractions, blunted in acetic acid-induced colitis, was also recovered in MC-treated rats. In conclusion, MC inhibited the gastrointestinal contractility with a probable involvement of  kinase pathways. In vivo, it was effective to prevent the deleterious effects of colitis resulting from acetic acid injury.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

S6K1 hyperactivation due to overnutrition leads to hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes. Our recent study showed that A77 1726, the active metabolite of the anti-rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug leflunomide, is an inhibitor of S6K1. Whether leflunomide can control hyperglycemia and sensitize the insulin receptor has not been tested. Here we report that A77 1726 increased AKT and S6K1 phosphorylation but decreased S6 and IRS-1 phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, C2C12 and L6 myotubes. A77 1726 increased insulin receptor  phosphorylation and binding of the p85 subunit of the PI-3 kinase to IRS-1. A77 1726 enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in L6 myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation to the plasma membrane of L6 cells. Finally, we investigated the anti-hyperglycemic effect of leflunomide on  and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetes mouse models. Leflunomide treatment normalized blood glucose levels and overcame insulin resistance in glucose and insulin tolerance tests in  and HFD-fed mice but had no effect on mice fed a normal chow diet (NCD). Leflunomide treatment increased AKT phosphorylation in the fat and muscle of  mice but not in normal mice. Our results suggest that leflunomide sensitizes the insulin receptor by inhibiting S6K1 activity , and that leflunomide could be potentially useful for treating patients with both RA and diabetes.© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30239561>Effects of 3-hydroxybutyrate and free   on muscle protein kinetics and signaling during LPS-induced inflammation in humans: anticatabolic impact of ketone bodies.</a></h1><p>Acute inflammation, and subsequent release of bacterial products (e.g. LPS), inflammatory cytokines, and stress hormones, is catabolic, and the loss of lean body mass predicts morbidity and mortality. Lipid intermediates may reduce protein loss, but the roles of free   (FFAs) and ketone bodies during acute inflammation are unclear.We aimed to test whether infusions of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3OHB), FFAs, and saline reduce protein catabolism during exposure to LPS and Acipimox (to restrict and control endogenous lipolysis).A total of 10 healthy male subjects were randomly tested 3 times, with: 1) LPS, Acipimox (Olbetam) and saline, 2) LPS, Acipimox, and nonesterified   (Intralipid), and 3) LPS, Acipimox, and 3OHB, during a 5-h basal period and a 2-h hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp. Labeled phenylalanine, , and urea tracers were used to estimate protein kinetics, and muscle biopsies were taken for Western blot analysis of protein metabolic signaling.3OHB infusion increased 3OHB concentrations (P < 0.0005) to 3.5 mM and decreased whole-body phenylalanine-to- degradation. Basal and insulin-stimulated net forearm phenylalanine release decreased by >70% (P < 0.005), with both appearance and phenylalanine disappearance being profoundly decreased. Phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α at Ser51 was increased in skeletal muscle, and S6 kinase phosphorylation at Ser235/236 tended (P = 0.074) to be decreased with 3OHB infusion (suggesting inhibition of protein synthesis), whereas no detectable effects were seen on markers of protein breakdown. Lipid infusion did not affect phenylalanine kinetics, and insulin sensitivity was unaffected by interventions.During acute inflammation, 3OHB has potent anticatabolic actions in muscle and at the whole-body level; in muscle, reduction of protein breakdown overrides inhibition of synthesis.

These receptors show a high degree of stereoselectivity towards several classes of drugs. This review covers the most relevant findings that have been made in the last decade and takes into consideration only those compounds in which stereochemistry led to unexpected results or peculiar interactions with the receptors. These cases are reviewed and discussed with the aim to show how enantiomeric recognition originates at the molecular level. The structural characterization by crystallographic methods and docking experiments of complexes formed by PPARs with their ligands turns out to be an essential tool to explain receptor stereoselectivity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Sodium valproate (VPA) is a traditional antiepileptic drug with mood-stabilization effect and is increasingly being used to treat bipolar disorders and depression, but its antidepressant mechanism remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible mechanisms of antidepressant action by studying malondialdehyde level, catalase, and superoxide dismutase activities in the serum and the mRNA and protein expression of  hydroxylase (TH) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) in the prefrontal cortex of rats exposed to chronic unpredicted stress (CUS). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish a depression model by CUS. VPA (300 mg/kg once daily) and an equivalent volume of vehicle were administered to rats by an intragastric gavage. Rat behaviors, serum malondialdehyde level, serum catalase and superoxide dismutase activities, and the mRNA and protein expressions of TH and TPH in the prefrontal cortex were determined. The results showed that VPA treatment led to a significant decrease in depression-like behaviors, improvement in oxidative stress imbalance, and enhancement of TH, TPH mRNA, and protein expression in stressed rats, but failed to show any significant changes in control rats. This could indicate that the antidepressant mechanism of VPA is perhaps linked to upregulation of TH and TPH expression and inhibition of oxidative damage in CUS rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29224876>Effect of different forage types on the  and sensory properties of bovine milk.</a></h1><p>The effect of 3 diets (grass, grass/clover, and total mixed ration) on the  and sensory properties of bovine milk was assessed over an entire lactation season. Little evidence was found of direct transfer of terpenes into raw milk from the different diets, and it is likely that the monocultures of ryegrass used with and without white clover were factors as these contained very few terpenes. Evidence of direct transfer of nonterpene volatiles from forage to the subsequent raw milks was probable; however, differences in the protein carbohydrate availability and digestion in the rumen appeared to have a greater contribution to  profiles. Pasteurization significantly altered the  profiles of all milks. A direct link between the milk  acid content, forage, and  products of lipid oxidation was also evident and differences in  acid content of milk due to forage may also have influenced the viscosity perception of milk. Irish sensory assessors preferred pasteurized milk produced from grass-fed cows, with least preference from milk produced from total mixed ration diets. β-Carotene content was significantly higher in milks derived from grass or grass/clover and appears to have directly influenced color perception. Toluene and p-cresol are both degradation products of β-carotene and along with β-carotene were identified as potential biomarkers for milk derived from pasture. The only correlation that appeared to influence the flavor of milk as determined using ranked descriptive analysis was p-cresol. P-Cresol appears to be responsible for the barnyard aroma of milk and is also likely derived from the deamination and decarboxylation of tryptophan and  due to the higher levels of available protein in the grass and grass/clover diets. The highest levels of p-cresol were in the grass/clover diets and are likely due to the degradation of the isoflavone formononetin in the rumen, which is present in white clover swards.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

However, there are still no biomarkers available to support objective laboratory testing for this disorder. Here, a GC-MS-based urinary metabolomics approach was used to characterize the urinary metabolic profiling of PSD (stroke) subjects and non-PSD (health controls) subjects in order to identify and validate urinary metabolite biomarkers for PSD. Six metabolites, azelaic acid, glyceric acid, pseudouridine, 5-hydroxyhexanoic acid, , and phenylalanine, were defined as biomarkers. A combined panel of these six urinary metabolites could effectively discriminate between PSD subjects and non-PSD subjects, achieving an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.961 in a training set (n = 72 PSD subjects and n = 146 non-PSD subjects). Moreover, this urinary biomarker panel was capable of discriminating blinded test samples (n = 58 PSD patients and n = 109 non-PSD subjects) with an AUC of 0.954. These findings suggest that a urine-based laboratory test using these biomarkers may be useful in the diagnosis of PSD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29778792>Valproic acid attenuates manganese-induced reduction in expression of GLT-1 and GLAST with concomitant changes in murine dopaminergic neurotoxicity.</a></h1><p>Exposure to elevated levels of manganese (Mn) causes manganism, a neurological disorder with similar characteristics to those of Parkinson's disease (PD). Valproic acid (VPA), an antiepileptic, is known to inhibit histone deacetylases and exert neuroprotective effects in many experimental models of neurological disorders. In the present study, we investigated if VPA attenuated Mn-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity and the possible mechanisms involved in VPA's neuroprotection, focusing on modulation of astrocytic glutamate transporters (glutamate aspartate transporter, GLAST and glutamate transporter 1, GLT-1) and histone acetylation in H4 astrocyte culture and mouse models. The results showed that VPA increased promoter activity, mRNA/protein levels of GLAST/GLT-1 and glutamate uptake, and reversed Mn-reduced GLAST/GLT-1 in in vitro astrocyte cultures. VPA also attenuated Mn-induced reduction of GLAST and GLT-1 mRNA/protein levels in midbrain and striatal regions of the mouse brain when VPA (200 mg/kg, i.p., daily, 21 d) was administered 30 min prior to Mn exposure (30 mg/kg, intranasal instillation, daily, 21 d). Importantly, VPA attenuated Mn-induced dopaminergic neuronal damage by reversing Mn-induced decrease of  hydroxylase (TH) mRNA/protein levels in the nigrostriatal regions. VPA also reversed Mn-induced reduction of histone acetylation in astrocytes as well as mouse brain tissue. Taken together, VPA exerts attenuation against Mn-induced decrease of astrocytic glutamate transporters parallel with reversing Mn-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity and Mn-reduced histone acetylation. Our findings suggest that VPA could serve as a potential neuroprotectant against Mn neurotoxicity as well as other neurodegenerative diseases associated with excitotoxicity and impaired astrocytic glutamate transporters.Copyright © 2018.

However, the in vivo anti-inflammatory activity and molecular mechanisms of anthraquinones have not been fully elucidated. We investigated the activity of anthraquinones using acute inflammatory and nociceptive experimental conditions. Anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid (9,10-dihydro-9,10-dioxo-2-anthracenecarboxylic acid, AQCA), one of the major anthraquinones identified from Brazilian taheebo, ameliorated various inflammatory and algesic symptoms in EtOH/HCl- and acetylsalicylic acid- (ASA-) induced gastritis, arachidonic acid-induced edema, and acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing without displaying toxic profiles in body and organ weight, gastric irritation, or serum parameters. In addition, AQCA suppressed the expression of inflammatory genes such as cyclooxygenase- (COX-) 2 in stomach tissues and lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) treated RAW264.7 cells. According to reporter gene assay and immunoblotting analyses, AQCA inhibited activation of the nuclear factor- (NF-) κB and activator protein- (AP-) 1 pathways by suppression of upstream signaling involving interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK1), p38, Src, and spleen  kinase (Syk). Our data strongly suggest that anthraquinones such as AQCA act as potent anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive components in vivo, thus contributing to the immune regulatory role of fruits and herbs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23007193>Valproate as a treatment for dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) in Parkinson's disease.</a></h1><p>It has been previously well established that the use of dopaminergic agents in Parkinson's disease may contribute to behavioral disturbances such as dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS), impulse control disorders (ICD), and punding.

GW7647 [a peroxisome proliferation activation receptor α (PPARα) agonist] enhanced the ACh-stimulated initial phase, and GW6471 (a PPARα antagonist) abolished the GW7647-induced enhancement. However, GW6471 produced the delayed, but transient, increase in the ACh-stimulated late phase, and it also decreased the initial phase and produced the delayed increase in the late phase during stimulation with ACh alone. A similar delayed increase in the ACh-stimulated late phase is induced by an inhibitor of the PKG, Rp8BrPETcGMPS, suggesting that GW6471 inhibits cGMP accumulation. An inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1), N(5)-[imino(propylamino)methyl]-L-ornithine hydrochloride (N-PLA), also abolished the GW7647-induced-enhancement of ACh-stimulated initial phase but produced the delayed increase in the late phase. However, in the presence of N-PLA, an NO donor or 8BrcGMP enhanced the ACh-stimulated initial phase and abolished the delayed increase in the late phase. Moreover, GW7647 and ACh stimulated NO production and cGMP accumulation in antral mucosae, which was inhibited by GW6471 or N-PLA. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry revealed that NOS1 and PPARα colocalize in antral mucous cells. In conclusion, during ACh stimulation, a PPARα autocrine mechanism, which accumulates NO via NOS1 leading to cGMP accumulation, modulates the Ca(2+)-regulated exocytosis in antral mucous cells.Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23285699>Examination by EPR spectroscopy of free radicals in melanins isolated from A-375 cells exposed on valproic acid and cisplatin.</a></h1><p>Drug binding by melanin biopolymers influence the effectiveness of the chemotherapy, radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy. Free radicals of melanins take part in formation of their complex with drugs. The aim of this work was to determine the effect of the two compounds: valproic acid (VPA) and cisplatin (CPT) on free radicals properties of melanin isolated from A-375 melanoma cells. Free radicals were examined by an X-band (9.3 GHz) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. EPR spectra were measured for the model synthetic eumelanin - DOPA-melanin, the melanin isolated from the control A-375 cells and these cells treated by VPA, CPT and both VPA and CPT. For all the examined samples broad EPR lines (deltaBpp: 0.48-0.68 mT) with g-factors of 2.0045-2.0060 characteristic for o-semiquinone free radicals were observed. Free radicals concentrations (N) in the tested samples, g-factors, amplitudes (A), integral intensities (I) and linewidths (deltaBpp) of the EPR spectra, were analyzed. The EPR lines were homogeneously broadened. Continuous microwave saturation of the EPR spectra indicated that slow spin-lattice relaxation processes existed in all the tested melanin samples. The relatively slowest spin-lattice relaxation processes characterized melanin isolated from A-375 cells treated with both VPA and CPT. The changes of the EPR spectra with increasing microwave power in the range of 2.2-70 mW were evaluated. Free radicals concentrations in the melanin from A-375 cells were higher than in the synthetic DOPA-melanin. The strong increase of free radicals concentration in the melanin from A-375 cells was observed after their treating by VPA. CPT also caused the increase of free radicals concentrations in the examined natural melanin. The free radicals concentration in melanin isolated from A-375 cells treated with both VPA and CPT was slightly higher than those in melanin from the control cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745969>Identification of the first potent, selective and bioavailable PPARα antagonist.</a></h1><p>The discovery and SAR of a novel series of potent and selective PPARα antagonists are herein described.

It is hypothesized that a drug delivery system that provides controlled and sustained release of PD drugs would afford better management of PD. Hollow microcapsules composed of poly-l-lactide (PLLA) and poly (caprolactone) (PCL) are prepared through a modified double-emulsion technique. They are loaded with three PD drugs, i.e., levodopa (LD), carbidopa (CD), and entacapone (ENT), at a ratio of 4:1:8, similar to commercial PD tablets. LD and CD are localized in both the hollow cavity and PLLA/PCL shell, while ENT is localized in the PLLA/PCL shell. Release kinetics of hydrophobic ENT is observed to be relatively slow as compared to the other hydrophilic drugs. It is further hypothesized that encapsulating ENT into PCL as a surface coating onto these microcapsules can aid in accelerating its release. Now, these spray-coated hollow microcapsules exhibit similar release kinetics, according to Higuchi's rate, for all three drugs. The results suggest that multiple drug encapsulation of LD, CD, and ENT in gastric floating microcapsules could be further developed for in vivo evaluation for the management of PD.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A novel intrastriatal rotenone model of Parkinson's disease was used to examine the neuroprotective effects of valproic acid (VPA), which is known to upregulate neurotrophic factors and other protective proteins in the brain. Sham or lesioned rats were treated with either vehicle or VPA at a dose of 4mg/mL in drinking water. The right striatum was lesioned by infusion of rotenone at three sites (2μg/site) along its rostro-caudal axis. A forelimb asymmetry (cylinder) test indicated a significant (p<0.01) decrease in use of the contralateral forelimb in rotenone-lesioned animals, in the third week post-lesioning, which was abolished by VPA treatment. Similarly, a significant (p<0.01) and persistent increase in use of the ipsilateral forelimb in lesioned animals over the 4weeks of testing, was not seen in animals treated with VPA. Results of the asymmetry test illustrate that intrastriatal infusion of rotenone causes contralateral motor dysfunction, which is blocked by VPA. The significant increase in ipsilateral forelimb use has not been documented previously, and presumably represents a compensatory response in lesioned animals. Six weeks post-surgery, animals were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion. Subsequent immunohistochemical examination revealed a decrease in  hydroxylase immunoreactivity within the striatum and substantia nigra of rotenone-lesioned animals. VPA treatment attenuated the decrease in  hydroxylase in the striatum and abolished it in the substantia nigra. Stereological cell counting indicated a significant (p<0.05) decrease in  hydroxylase-positive dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra of rotenone-lesioned animals, which was confirmed by Nissl staining. Importantly, this loss of dopamine neurons in rotenone-lesioned animals, was blocked by chronic VPA treatment. These findings strongly support the therapeutic potential of VPA in Parkinson's disease.Copyright © 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Although these agents primarily affect lipoprotein metabolism, their pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effect is one of the potential anti-atherosclerotic mechanisms. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of fenofibrate and gemfibrozil on inflammation in macrophages and reveal pathways these agents may affect.The two PPARα agonists inhibited secretion of CXCL2, TNF-α, IL-6, activation of p65 of NF-κB, ERK, and TLR4 expression. These changes occurred simultaneously with upregulation and secretion of β-defensin 1, an inflammation-modulating peptide. To demonstrate the role of β-defensin 1, it was knocked-down by target-specific siRNA. The effects of PPARα agonists on TLR4 expression and chemokine secretion were obviously abrogated with this treatment. In experiments investigating whether β-defensin 1 acts extracellularly, inflammatory chemokines decreased significantly after the addition of recombinant β-defensin 1 or conditioned media to cells. In experiments designed to clarify if the effects of the two agents are PPARα-dependent, induction of mRNA and secretion β-defensin 1 and inhibition of chemokine release were clearly reduced with GW6471, a PPARα blocker.Our results reveal the pathways by which fenofibrate and gemfibrozil inhibit LPS-induced inflammatory activation of macrophages.

Gestational intake of valproic acid (VPA) is linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), characterized by impaired sociability and stereotypies. VPA effects on the neurochemistry and functional morphology of the histaminergic system in ASD are unclear. Zebrafish are highly social, and given the similarities between zebrafish and human neurotransmitter systems, we have studied the effects of VPA on histamine in zebrafish.Histaminergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems of larval and adult zebrafish exposed to VPA from the end of gastrulation until neural tube formation were studied using HPLC, quantitative PCR, immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization. Sociability, dark-flash response and locomotion were also studied.Zebrafish larvae exposed to VPA showed decreased locomotion and an abnormal dark-flash response. Additionally, a reduced number of histaminergic neurons, low histamine and altered mRNA expression of key genes of the monoaminergic systems were also detected. The reduced mRNA expression of genes of the studied systems persisted until adulthood. Furthermore, adult VPA-exposed animals presented lower brain levels of noradrenaline and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, along with impaired sociability.VPA exposure in early development causes molecular and neurochemical alterations in zebrafish, which persist into adulthood and accompany impaired sociability. These findings will highlight the possible involvement of the histaminergic system in outcomes related to neuropsychiatric disorders. Furthermore, it supports zebrafish as a tool to investigate mechanisms underlying these disorders.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23639233>Monitoring conformational changes in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α by a genetically encoded photoamino acid, cross-linking, and mass spectrometry.</a></h1><p>Chemical cross-linking combined with an enzymatic digestion and mass spectrometric analysis of the reaction products has evolved into an alternative strategy to structurally resolve protein complexes.

Under the conditions of the experiments, betacyanin accumulation was generally enhanced by light. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment increased betacyanin synthesis in a concentration-dependent response. Seedlings treated with ethylene as 5mM Ethephon also had elevated levels of betacyanin. In contrast, salicylic acid (SA) and H(2)O(2) treatments had no influence on betacyanin contents in light or dark. Combined MeJA with Ethephon or H(2)O(2) had an additive effect on betacyanin accumulation in dark-grown seedlings. However, a decline was recorded in light-grown seedlings. Moreover, an antagonistic effect on betacyanin synthesis was found when MeJA and SA were added simultaneously. Our results indicate that betacyanin content in A. mangostanus seedlings can be upregulated by MeJA and ethylene. Both additive and antagonistic effects in regulating betacyanin synthesis in A. mangostanus seedlings were observed between MeJA and other elicitors.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Accumulation of genetic mutations within their oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes compels melanocytes to aberrant proliferation and spread to distant organs of the body, thereby resulting in severe and/or lethal malignancy. Metastatic melanoma's heavy mutational load, molecular heterogeneity and resistance to therapy necessitate the development of novel biomarkers and drug-based protocols that target key proteins involved in perpetuation of the disease. To this direction, we have herein employed a nano liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS) proteomics technology to profile the deep-proteome landscape of WM-266-4 human metastatic melanoma cells. Our advanced melanoma-specific catalogue proved to contain 6,681 unique proteins, which likely constitute the hitherto largest single cell-line-derived proteomic collection of the disease. Through engagement of UNIPROT, DAVID, KEGG, PANTHER, INTACT, CYTOSCAPE, dbEMT and GAD bioinformatics resources, WM-266-4 melanoma proteins were categorized according to their sub-cellular compartmentalization, function and tumorigenicity, and successfully reassembled in molecular networks and interactomes. The obtained data dictate the presence of plastically inter-converted sub-populations of non-cancer and cancer stem cells, and also indicate the oncoproteomic resemblance of melanoma to glioma and lung cancer. Intriguingly, WM-266-4 cells seem to be subjected to both epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) and mesenchymal-to-epithelial (MET) programs, with 1433G and ADT3 proteins being identified in the EMT/MET molecular interface. Oncogenic addiction of WM-266-4 cells to autocrine/paracrine signaling of IL17-, DLL3-, FGF(2/13)- and OSTP-dependent sub-routines suggests their critical contribution to the metastatic melanoma chemotherapeutic refractoriness. Interestingly, the 1433G family member that is shared between the BRAF- and EMT/MET-specific interactomes likely emerges as a novel and promising druggable target for the malignancy. Derailed proliferation and metastatic capacity of WM-266-4 cells could also derive from their metabolic addiction to pathways associated with glutamate/ammonia, propanoate and sulfur homeostasis, whose successful targeting may prove beneficial for advanced melanoma-affected patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26331720>Bioconversion of Pinoresinol Diglucoside and Pinoresinol from Substrates in the Phenylpropanoid Pathway by Resting Cells of Phomopsis sp.XP-8.</a></h1><p>Pinoresinol diglucoside (PDG) and pinoresinol (Pin) are normally produced by plant cells via the phenylpropanoid pathway. This study reveals the existence of a related pathway in Phomopsis sp. XP-8, a PDG-producing fungal strain isolated from the bark of the Tu-chung tree (Eucommiaulmoides Oliv.). After addition of 0.15 g/L glucose to Phomopsis sp. XP-8, PDG and Pin formed when phenylalanine, , leucine, cinnamic acid, and p-coumaric acid were used as the substrates respectively. No PDG formed in the absence of glucose, but Pin was detected after addition of all these substrates except leucine. In all systems in the presence of glucose, production of PDG and/or Pin and the accumulation of phenylalanine, cinnamic acid, or p-coumaric acid correlated directly with added substrate in a time- and substrate concentration- dependent manner. After analysis of products produced after addition of each substrate, the mass flow sequence for PDG and Pin biosynthesis was defined as: glucose to phenylalanine, phenylalanine to cinnamic acid, then to p-coumaric acid, and finally to Pin or PDG. During the bioconversion, the activities of four key enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway were also determined and correlated with accumulation of their corresponding products. PDG production by Phomopsis sp. exhibits greater efficiency and cost effectiveness than the currently-used plant-based system and will pave the way for large scale production of PDG and/or Pin for medical applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27102537>Microbial metabolism of dietary components to bioactive metabolites: opportunities for new therapeutic interventions.</a></h1><p>Mass spectrometry- and nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomic studies comparing diseased versus healthy individuals have shown that microbial metabolites are often the compounds most markedly altered in the disease state. Recent studies suggest that several of these metabolites that derive from microbial transformation of dietary components have significant effects on physiological processes such as gut and immune homeostasis, energy metabolism, vascular function, and neurological behavior. Here, we review several of the most intriguing diet-dependent metabolites that may impact host physiology and may therefore be appropriate targets for therapeutic interventions, such as short-chain  , trimethylamine N-oxide, tryptophan and  derivatives, and oxidized  . Such interventions will require modulating either bacterial species or the bacterial biosynthetic enzymes required to produce these metabolites, so we briefly describe the current understanding of the bacterial and enzymatic pathways involved in their biosynthesis and summarize their molecular mechanisms of action. We then discuss in more detail the impact of these metabolites on health and disease, and review current strategies to modulate levels of these metabolites to promote human health. We also suggest future studies that are needed to realize the full therapeutic potential of targeting the gut microbiota.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25351989>Impact of hyperpigmentation on superoxide flux and melanoma cell metabolism at mitochondrial complex II.</a></h1><p>Melanogenesis is a highly conserved process of cytophotoprotection from UV radiation present in many species. Although both mitochondrial function and UV radiation insults are well-documented promoters of increased cellular stress, their individual molecular relationships with skin pigmentation have not been clearly resolved. This study provides evidence for a direct relationship between cellular melanin content, superoxide flux, and mitochondrial function at complex II. Direct and significant correlation between increased pigmentation and complex II turnover was observed in genetically different melanoma cell lines of varied basal pigmentation states (P < 0.01). The same trend was also observed when comparing genetically identical cell cultures with increasing levels of induced pigmentation (P < 0.005). The observation of increased steady-state levels of the catalytic complex II succinate dehydrogenase subunit A alongside hyperpigmentation suggested coregulation of activity and pigment production (P < 0.01). The study also presents novel evidence for a relationship between hyperpigmentation and increased superoxide-generating capacity at complex II. By amperometrically monitoring superoxide flux from differently pigmented FM55 melanocytes and their isolated mitochondria, a dynamic and responsive relationship between pigmentation, complex II function, and intracellular superoxide generation was observed (P < 0.005). The data support hyperpigmentation as a protective antioxidant mechanism in response to complex II-mediated reactive oxygen species generation.© FASEB.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30629052>Simultaneous quantification of multiple bacterial metabolites using surface-enhanced Raman scattering.</a></h1><p>Given the commercial importance of the compounds produced by genetically modified organisms, there is a need for screening methods which facilitate the evaluation of newly developed strains, especially during the phase of proof-of-concept development.

A total of 2184 broiler breeders were assigned to 13 dietary treatments, with eight replicates per treatment. The 13 treatments included one control group and 12 additional treatments employing two sources and six levels (0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25 and 1.00%). Higher plasma methionine concentration was measured for DL-methionine (DLM) treated hens. Plasma alanine concentration was linearly increased as DLM or 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio) butanoic acid (HMTBA) supplementation level increased. There was a linear increase in concentrations of , valine, glycine and serine as dietary DLM supplementation level increased. Hens treated with DLM had higher relative expression of ADA than those fed HMTBA. The expression of MS, ADA, SAHH and MAT2A changed quadratically as HMTBA supplementation level increased, while the expression of GNMT and SAHH changed quadratically as DLM supplementation level increased. In conclusion, the effects of HMTBA on plasma free amino acid patterns and the expression of hepatic genes involved with methionine are different from DLM.© 2017 The Authors.

The search for the novel compounds for the effective control of CML is now in the spotlight. The progression of CML to blast crisis is correlated with down-modulation of C/EBP alpha. Therefore, C/EBP alpha may be considered as a putative target in differentiation therapies in myeloid leukemias. The aim of the study was to assess the potential of vitamin E as the possible inducer of C/EBP alpha expression in BCR-ABL-positive CML K562 cells.RNA extracted from K562 cells cultured with valproic acid or vitamin E was converted to cDNA, RT-PCR reactions were carried out using HotStarTaq DNA polymerase with primers for C/EBP alpha and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR).We have not found detectable expression of C/EBP alpha in K562 cells. Upon 48-h culture with vitamin E at a dose of 100 µM, K562 cells expressed both C/EBP alpha and G-CSFR.Vitamin E restored the expression of C/EBP alpha mRNA in chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. In this setting, G-CSFR expression in vitamin E treated K562 cells seems to suggest the activation to granulocytic differentiation. It should be further elucidated whether such effects of vitamin E on C/EBP alpha transcription factor are direct or mediated indirectly due to antioxidant properties of vitamin E.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24113234>High-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of dasatinib in rabbit plasma using fluorescence detection and its application to a pharmacokinetic study.</a></h1><p>A highly selective, sensitive, and rapid high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method has been developed and validated to quantify dasatinib, a  kinase inhibitor, in rabbit plasma. Montelukast was used as internal standard (IS). Dasatinib and IS were extracted by deproteinization technique, followed by injection of aliquot of supernatant into chromatographic system. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a reversed phase C18 column with a mobile phase of 0.02M potassium dihydrogen phosphate:methanol (10:90, v/v) pumped at flow rate of 2.0mL/min. The analytes were detected at 340 and 374nm for excitation and emission, respectively. The assay exhibited a linear range of 50.0-3000ng/mL, with a lower detection limit of 15.0ng/mL. The method was statistically validated for linearity, accuracy, precision, selectivity and stability following FDA guidelines. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation did not exceed 13.5% from the nominal concentration. The accuracy of dasatinib was within ±15% of the theoretical value. The assay has been applied successfully in a pharmacokinetic study.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The biosynthesis of rosmarinic acid is initiated by two parallel pathways, namely the phenylpropanoid pathway and the -derived pathway. Salvianolic acid B is a structural dimer of rosmarinic acid and is believed to be derived from rosmarinic acid. In the current study, methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and hyphal extracts from fungi were used as elicitors to examine the relationship between enzymes in the two parallel pathways and accumulation of phenolic compounds in S. miltiorrhiza hairy root cultures. The results showed that accumulations of rosmarinic acid, salvianolic acid B and total phenolics were enhanced by MeJA while suppressed by fugal extracts. Responses of enzymes in the -derived pathway, at both the gene transcript and enzyme activity levels, showed a better consistency with alterations of phenolic compounds content after the two elicitors treated. Our study implied that compared with enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway, enzymes in the -derived pathway are more correlated to rosmarinic acid and salvianolic acid B biosynthesis in S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots.Copyright © 2013 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

Outcome measurements of metabolic responses, inflammatory markers and gut bacterial composition were analysed at the end of each 42-day supplementation period.Both IPE and inulin supplementation improved insulin resistance compared with cellulose supplementation, measured by homeostatic model assessment 2 (mean±SEM 1.23±0.17 IPE vs 1.59±0.17 cellulose, p=0.001; 1.17±0.15 inulin vs 1.59±0.17 cellulose, p=0.009), with no differences between IPE and inulin (p=0.272). Fasting insulin was only associated positively with plasma  and negatively with plasma glycine following inulin supplementation. IPE supplementation decreased proinflammatory interleukin-8 levels compared with cellulose, while inulin had no impact on the systemic inflammatory markers studied. Inulin promoted changes in gut bacterial populations at the class level (increased Actinobacteria and decreased Clostridia) and order level (decreased Clostridiales) compared with cellulose, with small differences at the species level observed between IPE and cellulose.These data demonstrate a distinctive physiological impact of raising colonic propionate delivery in humans, as improvements in insulin sensitivity promoted by IPE and inulin were accompanied with different effects on the plasma metabolome, gut bacterial populations and markers of systemic inflammation.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The transport profiles of regorafenib by various transporters were evaluated. HEK293/organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) cells exhibited increased drug sensitivity to regorafenib. Regorafenib inhibited the uptake of 3H-estrone sulfate by HEK293/OATP1B1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, but did not affect its elimination by P-glycoproteins. The concentration of regorafenib was significantly lower in LLC-PK1/multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) cells than in LLC-PK1 cells treated with the MRP2 inhibitor, MK571. MK571 abolished the inhibitory effects of regorafenib on intracellular accumulation in LLC-PK1/MRP2 cells. The uptake of regorafenib was significantly higher in HEK293/OATP1B1 cells than in OATP1B1-mock cells. Transport kinetics values were estimated to be Km=15.9 µM and Vmax=1.24 nmol/mg/min. No significant difference was observed in regorafenib concentrations between HEK293/OATP1B3 and OATP1B3-mock cells.

Recent studies have emphasized the crosstalk between gut and brain, highlighting how gut composition can influence behavior and brain functions. Thus, the present study investigates the relationship between PANS/PANDAS and gut microbiota ecology. The gut composition of a cohort of 30 patients with PANS/PANDAS was analyzed and compared to control subjects using 16S rRNA-based metagenomics. Data were analyzed for their α- and β-diversity; differences in bacterial distribution were detected by Wilcoxon and LEfSe tests, while metabolic profile was predicted via PICRUSt software. These analyses demonstrate the presence of an altered bacterial community structure in PANS/PANDAS patients with respect to controls. In particular, ecological analysis revealed the presence of two main clusters of subjects based on age range. Thus, to avoid age bias, data from patients and controls were split into two groups: 4-8 years old and >9 years old. The younger PANS/PANDAS group was characterized by a strong increase in Bacteroidetes; in particular, , , and  were identified as potential microbial biomarkers of this composition type. Moreover, this group exhibited an increase of several pathways concerning the modulation of the antibody response to inflammation within the gut as well as a decrease in pathways involved in brain function (i.e., , D-alanine and  metabolism, and the dopamine pathway). The older group of patients displayed a less uniform bacterial profile, thus impairing the identification of distinct biomarkers. Finally, Pearson's analysis between bacteria and anti-streptolysin O titer reveled a negative correlation between genera belonging to Firmicutes phylum and anti-streptolysin O while a positive correlation was observed with . In conclusion, this study suggests that streptococcal infections alter gut bacterial communities leading to a pro-inflammatory status through the selection of specific bacterial strains associated with gut inflammation and immune response activation. These findings highlight the possibility of studying bacterial biomarkers associated with this disorder and might led to novel potential therapeutic strategies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27617199>Causality of small and large intestinal microbiota in weight regulation and insulin resistance.</a></h1><p>The twin pandemics of obesity and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) are a global challenge for health care systems. Changes in the environment, behavior, diet, and lifestyle during the last decades are considered the major causes. A Western diet, which is rich in saturated fat and simple sugars, may lead to changes in gut microbial composition and physiology, which have recently been linked to the development of metabolic diseases.We will discuss evidence that demonstrates the influence of the small and large intestinal microbiota on weight regulation and the development of insulin resistance, based on literature search.Altered large intestinal microbial composition may promote obesity by increasing energy harvest through specialized gut microbes. In both large and small intestine, microbial alterations may increase gut permeability that facilitates the translocation of whole bacteria or endotoxic bacterial components into metabolic active tissues. Moreover, changed microbial communities may affect the production of satiety-inducing signals. Finally, bacterial metabolic products, such as short chain   (SCFAs) and their relative ratios, may be causal in disturbed immune and metabolic signaling, notably in the small intestine where the surface is large. The function of these organs (adipose tissue, brain, liver, muscle, pancreas) may be disturbed by the induction of low-grade inflammation, contributing to insulin resistance.Interventions aimed to restoring gut microbial homeostasis, such as ingestion of specific fibers or therapeutic microbes, are promising strategies to reduce insulin resistance and the related metabolic abnormalities in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes.

Neurotoxic effect was reported recently beside the potential estrogenic activity of parabens. There is controversy as to the potential harmful effects of butyl parabens, which are suspected to contribute to autism and learning disabilities. The purpose of this study was to examine the similarities between paraben intoxication signs in the rat brain and brain markers in an autistic like rat model. This study provides evidence of many parallels between the two, including (1) oxidative stress, (2) decreased reduced glutathione levels and elevated oxidised glutathione, (3) mitochondrial dysfunction, and (4) neuroinflammation and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the brain (tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1-beta, and interleukin-6). (5) Increased protein oxidation reported by a significant increase in 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT)/ ratio. (6) A marked disturbance was found in the production of energy carriers (AMP, ATP and AMP/ATP ratio) in comparison with the control. The evidence suggests that paraben may, to some extent, either cause or contribute to the brain physiopathology in ASDs or pathogens that produce the brain pathology observed in the diagnosed rat model of ASD.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, molecular characteristics of PD-CRC remain unknown to date, particularly in molecular targeting therapy for patients with PD-CRC. In this study, we examined the expression of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 in PD-CRC by immunohistochemical analysis of archived clinical specimens of primary tumors and investigated the sensitivity of PD-CRC cell lines to gefitinib, a  kinase inhibitor for EGFR in vitro. We found that HER3 expression of PD-CRC among members of the HER family was significantly lower than that of well to moderately differentiated CRC (WMD-CRC) and 37% of the PD cases showed a EGFR+/HER2+/HER3- expression pattern. COLM-5 cells, a PD-CRC-derived cell line, which exhibits EGFR+/HER2+/HER3- expression pattern and recapitulates the typical histology of PD-CRC in xenografted tumors, showed high gefitinib sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo, compared with WMD-CRC cell line (COLM-2). Treatment with gefitinib resulted in the upregulation of p27Kip1 expression and induction of G1 cell cycle arrest, concomitantly associated with inactivation of PI3K/Akt signaling in COLM-5 cells and marked inhibition of xenografted tumors in nude mice, but not evident in COLM-2 cells. Treatment with sodium butyrate, an HDAC inhibitor that induces differentiation, upregulated the expression of HER3 associated with enhancement of the PI3K/Akt signaling, attenuated gefitinib-mediated p27Kip1 upregulation and reduced gefitinib sensitivity in COLM-5 cells in vitro. Furthermore, enforced expression of HER3 in COLM-5 cells resulted in significant resistance to gefitinib treatment both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that deficient HER3 expression plays an important role in gefitinib sensitivity and that a malignant subset of PD with EGFR+/HER2+/HER3- phenotype is a potential candidate for a target of anti-EGFR molecular therapy such as gefitinib.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28049942>Intranasal Administration of Rotenone to Mice Induces Dopaminergic Neurite Degeneration of Dopaminergic Neurons in the Substantia Nigra.</a></h1><p>Exposure to environmental neurotoxins is suspected to be a risk factor for sporadic progressive neurodegenerative diseases.

We previously reported that intranasal administration of rotenone in mice induced dopaminergic (DA) neurodegeneration in the olfactory bulb (OB) and reduced olfactory functions. In the present study, we investigated the DA neurons in the brains of mice that were administered rotenone intranasally for an extended period. We found that the olfactory function of mice was attenuated by rotenone administration. Electrophysiological analysis of the mitral cells, which are output neurons in the OB, revealed that the inhibitory input into the mitral cells was retarded.

However, this compound was vulnerable to environmental factors. Our research has been continuously made to improve druggability of Butenal and identified 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal diacetate (HPBD) as an alternative. Herein, to investigate potential anti-neuroinflammatory and anti-amyloidogenic effects of HPBD, we treated HPBD (0.5, 1, and 2 μg/ml) on the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (1 μg/ml) stimulated astrocytes and microglial BV-2 cell. HPBD inhibited LPS-induced NO and ROS production, and LPS-elevated expression of iNOS, COX2, β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), C99, and Aβ1-42 levels as well as attenuation of β-secretase activities. The activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), signal transducer and activator of transcription1 (STAT1), and STAT3 was concomitantly inhibited by HPBD. Moreover, siRNA targeting STAT3 abolished HPBD-induced inhibitory effects on neuro-inflammation and amyloidogenesis. In addition, pull down assay and docking model showed interaction of HPBD with STAT3. These findings suggest that HPBD may be useful and potentially therapeutic choices for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, many patients exhibit resistance to IM in the clinic. Recent studies have indicated that sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a class III histone deacetylase (HDAC), plays an important role in leukemogenesis. In addition, some HDAC inhibitors are being tested to determine their anti-cancer activities in clinical trials. Divalproex sodium (DVPX), a first-line treatment for epilepsy, is also a HDAC inhibitor. However, it is unclear whether the anti-leukemic effects of IM in combination with DVPX on CML cells are related to SIRT1. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of IM in combination with DVPX on cell viability, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest in CML cells and to explore the underlying mechanisms. It was found that DVPX enhanced IM-induced cell growth inhibition, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in K562-S and K562-G cells. Surprisingly, the level of p-Bcr-Abl was similar in K562-S and K562-G cells. Moreover, IM combined with DVPX had no effects on the phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl and its downstream target STAT5. Further study revealed that SIRT1 expression was higher in K562-G cells compared with K562-S cells. DVPX enhanced the inhibitory effect of IM on SIRT1 expression in K562-S and K562-G cells. Furthermore, knockdown of SIRT1 promoted apoptosis of K562-G cells treated with IM and DVPX. These results indicate that DVPX may increase the sensitivity of CML cells to IM and reverse IM resistance by regulating SIRT1 expression.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The etiology of PCOS is still unknown. Mice prenatally treated with glucocorticoids exhibit metabolic disturbances that are similar to those seen in women with PCOS. We used an untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics approach to understand the metabolic changes occurring in the plasma and kidney over time in female glucocorticoid-treated (GC-treated) mice. There are significant changes in plasma amino acid levels (valine, , and proline) and their intermediates (2-hydroxybutyrate, 4-aminobutyrate, and taurine), whereas in kidneys, the TCA cycle metabolism (citrate, fumarate, and succinate) and the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway products (inosine and uracil) are significantly altered (p < 0.05) from 8 to 16 weeks of age. Levels of NADH, NAD(+), NAD(+)/NADH, and NADH redox in kidneys indicate increased mitochondrial oxidative stress from 8 to 16 weeks in GC-treated mice. These results indicate that altered metabolic substrates in the plasma and kidneys of treated mice are associated with altered amino acid metabolism, increased cytoplasmic PP, and increased mitochondrial activity, leading to a more oxidized state. This study identifies biomarkers associated with metabolic dysfunction in kidney mitochondria of a prenatal gluococorticoid-treated mouse model of PCOS that may be used as early predictive biomarkers of oxidative stress in the PCOS metabolic disorder in women.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27381084>Synthesis of MR-49, a deiodinated analog of tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac), as a novel pro-angiogenesis modulator.</a></h1><p>The -based hormones 3,3',5-triiodo-l-thyronine (l-T3) and l-thyroxine (l-T4) that are produced by the thyroid gland control metabolic functions. Iodothyronine deiodinase enzymes convert l-T4 to l-T3, the form of thyroid hormone critical to genomic actions within cells and regulation of metabolism, and to reverse-l-T3, a hormone isoform that is largely inactive. We used tertiary amines in a study of deiodination based on derivatives of tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac)-a naturally occurring derivative of l-T4-to mimic the action of the iodothyronine deiodinases and deiodination of the outer ring iodines. Deiodinated tetrac, MR-49, was found to be pro-angiogenic, with this activity exceeding that of l-T3 and l-T4 in a hemoglobin Matrigel® plug assay of angiogenesis. Tetrac is anti-angiogenic via several nongenomic pathways, and the present studies of MR-49 reveal the critical contribution of outer ring iodines to the angiogenic properties of thyroid hormone analogues, which may have utility as pro-angiogenic pharmaceuticals.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We evaluated the effects of prepartum fat supplementation on energy-balance parameters and plasma concentrations of glucagon-like peptide-1, peptide - (PYY), adropin, insulin, leptin, glucose, nonesterified  acid, and β-hydroxybutyric acid in dairy cows. Twenty-four pregnant dairy cows were randomized to diets containing either rolled canola or sunflower seed at 8% of dry matter, or no oilseed supplementation, during the last 5 wk of gestation and then assigned to a common lactation diet postpartum. Blood samples were collected at -2, +2, and +14 h relative to feeding, at 2 wk after the initiation of the diets, and at 2 wk postpartum. Dietary canola and sunflower supplementation alone did not affect energy balance, body weight, and plasma concentrations of glucagon-like peptide-1, PYY, adropin, insulin, leptin, nonesterified  acid, and β-hydroxybutyric acid; however, canola decreased and sunflower tended to decrease dry matter intake. We also observed that the physiological stage had a significant, but divergent, effect on circulating hormones and metabolite concentrations. Plasma glucagon-like peptide-1, PYY, adropin, nonesterified  acid, and β-hydroxybutyric acid concentrations were greater postpartum than prepartum, whereas glucose, insulin, leptin, body weight, and energy balance were greater prepartum than postpartum. Furthermore, the interaction of treatment and stage was significant for leptin and adropin, and tended toward significance for PYY and insulin; only insulin exhibited an apparent postprandial increase. Postpartum PYY concentrations exhibited a strong negative correlation with body weight, suggesting that PYY may be associated with body weight regulation during the transition period. These novel findings demonstrate that the transition from pregnancy to lactation is a stronger determinant of circulating gut hormone concentrations than dietary lipid in transition dairy cows.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

These compounds are present in plants at low concentrations, therefore, complex purification processes are usually required to extract the product. An alternative production method for these aromatic  is based on the use of microbial strains modified by metabolic engineering. These biotechnological processes are usually based on the use of simple sugars like glucose as a raw material. However, sustainable production processes should preferably be based on the use of waste material such as lignocellulosic hydrolysates.In this study, E. coli strains with active (W3110) and inactive phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) (VH33) were engineered for CA and pHCA production by transforming them with plasmids expressing genes encoding phenylalanine/ ammonia lyase (PAL/TAL) enzymes from Rhodotorula glutinis or Arabidopsis thaliana as well as genes aroGfbr and tktA, encoding a feedback inhibition resistant version of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase and transketolase, respectively. The generated strains were evaluated in cultures with glucose, xylose or arabinose, as well as a simulated lignocellulosic hydrolysate containing a mixture of these three sugars plus acetate. Production of CA was detected in strains expressing PAL/TAL from A. thaliana, whereas both CA and pHCA accumulated in strains expressing the enzyme from R. glutinis. These experiments identified arabinose and W3110 expressing PAL/TAL from A. thaliana, aroGfbr and tktA as the carbon source/strain combination resulting in the best CA specific productivity and titer. To improve pHCA production, a mutant with inactive pheA gene was generated, causing an 8-fold increase in the yield of this aromatic acid from the sugars in a simulated hydrolysate.In this study the quantitative contribution of active or inactive PTS as well as expression of PAL/TAL from R. glutinis or A. thaliana were determined for production performance of CA and pHCA when growing on carbon sources derived from lignocellulosic hydrolysates.

Here, we investigate whether such physiological improvements are associated to epigenetic effects dependent on increased histone acetylation and whether butyrate exerts a direct action on skeletal muscle insulin signalling. We show that sodium butyrate (NaBut) ameliorates the insulin-resistant phenotype, induced in L6 myotubes by prolonged exposure to palmitate, by i) increasing the insulin-induced phosphorylation of both PKB (protein kinase B) and MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase), the two branches of insulin signalling and ii) increasing histone H3 acetylation - even in the presence of palmitate - on chromatin in proximity of the Irs1 (insulin receptor substrate 1) transcriptional start site. Consequently, NaBut induced Irs1 mRNA and protein overexpression, which in turn relayed higher insulin-stimulated IRS1  phosphorylation and PI 3-kinase (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) association, suggesting that the increased IRS1 expression may mediate the insulin-sensitizing effects of NaBut. Furthermore, downstream of PKB, NaBut induced GSK3β gene upregulation. Our observations indicate that NaBut - through its action as HDAC inhibitor - can promote insulin responsiveness in L6 myotubes under conditions of lipid-induced insulin resistance.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Although these compounds are widely used in human health care and nutrition services, their availability is limited by regional variations, and isolation of single compounds from plants is often difficult. Recent advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering have enabled artificial production of plant secondary metabolites in microorganisms.We develop an Escherichia coli system containing an artificial biosynthetic pathway that yields phenylpropanoic , such as 4-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid, from simple carbon sources. These artificial biosynthetic pathways contained a codon-optimized tal gene that improved the productivity of 4-coumaric acid and ferulic acid, but not caffeic acid in a minimal salt medium. These heterologous pathways extended in E. coli that had biosynthesis machinery overproducing . Finally, the titers of 4-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid reached 974 mg/L, 150 mg/L, and 196 mg/L, respectively, in shake flasks after 36-hour cultivation.We achieved one gram per liter scale production of 4-coumaric acid. In addition, maximum titers of 150 mg/L of caffeic acid and 196 mg/L of ferulic acid were achieved. Phenylpropanoic , such as 4-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid, have a great potential for pharmaceutical applications and food ingredients.

The primary motor symptoms of the disease are due to degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons. Dopamine replacement therapies have therefore revolutionised disease management by partially controlling these symptoms. However these drugs can produce debilitating side effects when used long term and do not protect degenerating neurons against death. Recent evidence has highlighted a pathological imbalance in PD between the acetylation and deacetylation of the histone proteins around which deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is coiled, in favour of excessive histone deacetylation. This mechanism of adding/removing acetyl groups to histone lysine residues is one of many epigenetic regulatory processes which control the expression of genes, many of which will be essential for neuronal survival. Hence, such epigenetic modifications may have a pathogenic role in PD. It has therefore been hypothesised that if this pathological imbalance can be corrected with the use of histone deacetylase inhibiting agents then neurodegeneration observed in PD can be ameliorated. This article will review the current literature with regard to epigenetic changes in PD and the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) in PD: examining the evidence of the neuroprotective effects of numerous HDACIs in cellular and animal models of Parkinsonian cell death.

Information about the role of Syk in colorectal cancers (CRC) is limited, and conflicting reports have been published. We studied Syk expression and its role in differentiation and apoptosis of the colonocytes. Here, we reported for the first time that expression of two transcript variants of Syk is suppressed in colonocytes during butyrate-induced differentiation, which mediates apoptosis of HT-29 cells. Despite being a known HDAC inhibitor, butyrate deacetylates histone3/4 around the transcription start site (TSS) of Syk. Histone deacetylation precludes the binding of RNA Polymerase II to the promoter and inhibits transcription. Since butyrate is a colonic metabolite derived from undigested fibers, our study offers a plausible explanation of the underlying mechanisms of the protective role of butyrate as well as the dietary fibers against CRC through the regulation of Syk. We also report that combined use of butyrate and highly specific Syk inhibitor BAY61-3606 does not enhance differentiation and apoptosis of colonocytes. Instead, BAY completely abolishes butyrate-induced differentiation and apoptosis in a Syk- and ERK1/2-dependent manner. While butyrate dephosphorylates ERK1/2 in HT-29 cells, BAY re-phosphorylates it, leading to its activation. This study describes a novel mechanism of butyrate action in CRC and explores the role of Syk in butyrate-induced differentiation and apoptosis. In addition, our study highlights those commercial small molecule inhibitors, although attractive drug candidates should be used with concern because of their frequent off-target effects. J. Cell.

Much of this interest stems from animal and human studies which suggest that an increased intake of fermentable fibre can suppress appetite and improve weight management. A growing number of reports have demonstrated that the principal products of colonic fermentation of dietary fibre, , contribute to energy homeostasis via effects on multiple cellular metabolic pathways and receptor-mediated mechanisms. In particular, over the past decade it has been identified that a widespread receptor system exists for . These G-protein-coupled receptors, free  acid receptor (FFAR) 2 and FFAR3 are expressed in numerous tissue sites, including the gut epithelium and adipose tissue. Investigations using FFAR2- or FFAR3-deficient animal models suggest that -mediated stimulation of these receptors enhances the release of the anorectic hormones peptide   and glucagon-like peptide-1 from colonic L cells and leptin from adipocytes. In addition, the  acetate has recently been shown to have a direct role in central appetite regulation. Furthermore, the  propionate is a known precursor for hepatic glucose production, which has been reported to suppress feeding behaviour in ruminant studies through the stimulation of hepatic vagal afferents. The present review therefore proposes that an elevated colonic production of  could stimulate numerous hormonal and neural signals at different organ and tissue sites that would cumulatively suppress short-term appetite and energy intake.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23452348>Metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 signaling enhances TRPM1 calcium channel function and increases melanin content in human melanocytes.</a></h1><p>Mutations in TRPM1, a calcium channel expressed in retinal bipolar cells and epidermal melanocytes, cause complete congenital stationary night blindness with no discernible skin phenotype. In the retina, TRPM1 activity is negatively coupled to metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6) signaling through Gαo and TRPM1 mutations result in the loss of responsiveness of TRPM1 to mGluR6 signaling. Here, we show that human melanocytes express mGluR6, and treatment of melanocytes with L-AP4, a type III mGluR-selective agonist, enhances Ca(2+) uptake. Knockdown of TRPM1 or mGluR6 by shRNA abolished L-AP4-induced Ca(2+) influx and TRPM1 currents, showing that TRPM1 activity in melanocytes is positively coupled to mGluR6 signaling. Gαo protein is absent in melanocytes. However, forced expression of Gαo restored negative coupling of TRPM1 to mGluR6 signaling, but treatment with pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gi /Go proteins, did not affect basal or mGluR6-induced Ca(2+) uptake. Additionally, chronic stimulation of mGluR6 altered melanocyte morphology and increased melanin content. These data suggest differences in coupling of TRPM1 function to mGluR6 signaling explain different cellular responses to glutamate in the retina and the skin.© 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29855977>Thymoquinone loaded solid lipid nanoparticles counteracts 3-Nitropropionic acid induced motor impairments and neuroinflammation in rat model of Huntington's disease.</a></h1><p>Defect in gene transcription, excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are the dominant disease process that causes striatal cell loss with motor abnormalities in Huntington's disease (HD). Homogeneous pathological reminiscent of HD was extrapolated in the present study using a potent mitochondrial toxin, 3-Nitropropionic acid (3-NP). Administration of 3-NP for 14 days in the present study portends glial cell activation, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor stimulation, neuroinflammation and motor deficits. The therapeutic strategy in the present study was improvised by formulating thymoquinone, a biologically active compound into a colloidal carrier namely solid lipid nanoparticles. Treatment with 10 and 20 mg/kg b.w of thymoquinone loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (TQ-SLNs) and 80 mg/kg b.w of thymoquinone suspension (TQ-S) showed a significant (P < 0.01) improvement in ATPases function in 3-NP induced animals than TQ-S (40 mg/kg b.w) treated group. TQ-SLNs (10 and 20 mg/kg) treatment also attenuated the overexpression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), pro-inflammatory cytokines and p-p65 NFκB nuclear translocation in 3-NP exposed animals. Further, TQ-SLNs treatment desensitizes NR2B-subtype NMDA receptor, improves  hydroxylase (TH) immune reactive neurons and ameliorated the motor abnormalities in 3-NP intoxicated animals than TQ-S treated group. Hence, the study signifies that the treatment with lower doses of nanoformulated thymoquinone than thymoquinone suspension can efficiently culminate 3-NP induced HD progression in the striatum of male wistar rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631960>Systems biochemical responses of rats to Kansui and vinegar-processed Kansui exposure by integrated metabonomics.</a></h1><p>The dried root of Kansui (Euphorbia kansui L.) is an effective and commonly used traditional Chinese medicine. Even so, Kansui cannot be satisfactorily applied clinically because of toxic side effects. In China, the most common Kansui-processing method uses vinegar to reduce its toxicity. The present study was designed to investigate the toxic effects caused by Kansui and evaluate detoxification of Kansui by vinegar processing of Kansui.Thirty male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to five groups of six rats. Two experimental groups were oral gavaged with 7.875 and 15.75 g Kansui/kg body weight, two treated with 7.875 and 15.75 g VP-Kansui/kg body weight for 14 d, and the control group concurrently subjected to oral gavage with only distilled water. On day 14, plasma, liver and kidney tissues were collected from all rats for biochemistry assessments, histopathological examination, and NMR analyses.The metabonome of rats treated with Kansui and vinegar-processed (VP-) Kansui was found to differ from that of controls. In liver extracts, the variational metabolites included elevated concentrations of isoleucine, leucine, valine, glutamate, and phenylalanine, with decreased taurine, glucose, and glycogen. However, changes in lysine, methionine, choline, phosphorylcholine, and  were only observed in Kansui-treated rats. In kidney extracts, prominent changes included elevations in isoleucine, leucine, valine, methionine, creatine/creatinine, and phenylalanine as well as decreased glutamine. Only Kansui treatment induced variations in alanine, lysine, acetate, choline, and phosphorylcholine.Perturbations in endogenous metabolites induced by Kansui correlated with disturbances in glycolysis and amino acid and lipid metabolism, while biochemical pathway disorders caused by VP-Kansui only involved glycolysis and amino acid metabolism. All results were confirmed by histopathological examination of liver and kidney tissues and clinical biochemistry analyses.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

These ketone bodies are both energy-storage forms of acetyl-CoA. In order to clarify the structural mechanisms of the catalytic reaction with the cognate substrate D-3-hydroxybutyrate and of the inhibition of the reaction by inhibitors, the enzyme from Alcaligenes faecalis has been analyzed by X-ray crystallography in liganded states with the substrate and with two types of inhibitor: malonate and methylmalonate. In each subunit of the tetrameric enzyme, the substrate is trapped on the nicotinamide plane of the bound NAD(+). An OMIT map definitively shows that the bound ligand is D-3-hydroxybutyrate and not acetoacetate. The two carboxylate O atoms form four hydrogen bonds to four conserved amino-acid residues. The methyl group is accommodated in the nearby hydrophobic pocket so that the formation of a hydrogen bond from the OH group of the substrate to the hydroxy group of Tyr155 at the active centre is facilitated. In this geometry, the H atom attached to the C(3) atom of the substrate in the sp(3) configuration is positioned at a distance of 3.1 Å from the nicotinamide C(4) atom in the direction normal to the plane. In addition, the donor-acceptor relationship of the hydrogen bonds suggests that the Tyr155 OH group is allowed to ionize by the two donations from the Ser142 OH group and the ribose OH group. A comparison of the protein structures with and without ligands indicates that the Gln196 residue of the small movable domain participates in the formation of additional hydrogen bonds. It is likely that this situation can facilitate H-atom movements as the trigger of the catalytic reaction. In the complexes with inhibitors, however, their principal carboxylate groups interact with the enzyme in a similar way, while the interactions of other groups are changed. The crucial determinant for inhibition is that the inhibitors have no active H atom at C(3). A second determinant is the Tyr155 OH group, which is perturbed by the inhibitors to donate its H atom for hydrogen-bond formation, losing its nucleophilicity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29297162>Insights into the effect and interaction mechanism of bisphenol S on lipids hydrolysis in sludge through multi-spectra, thermodynamics, and molecule docking analysis.</a></h1><p>As an alternative to bisphenol A, bisphenol S (BPS) is widely used in industrial production and daily life, which is then discharged into sewage treatment plants and accumulates in sludge. In this research, impact and interaction mechanism of BPS on lipids hydrolysis in sludge is studied from the respect of soluble organic matter and  organic   (VFAs). Multi-spectra, thermodynamics, molecule docking, and enzyme activity assay are applied to elucidate the effect mechanism of BPS on lipids hydrolysis. Results show that lipids hydrolysis is restrained due to the denaturation of lipase with BPS exposure. The interaction mechanism is involved in hydrophobic bond and hydrogen bond interaction in the activity region of lipase. This interaction not only results in an unfolding skeleton structure of lipase and a less hydrophobic microenvironment of  and tryptophan residues but also leads to fluorophore static quenching with the formation of lipase-BPS complex.

However, the coproheme decarboxylase reaction mechanism is unclear. The structure of the decarboxylase in complex with coproheme III suggested that the substrate iron, reactive propionates, and an active-site  convey a net 2e/2H from each propionate to an activated form of HO Time-resolved EPR spectroscopy revealed that Tyr-145 formed a radical species within 30 s of the reaction of the enzyme-coproheme complex with HO This radical disappeared over the next 270 s, consistent with a catalytic intermediate. Use of the harderoheme III intermediate as substrate or substitutions of redox-active side chains (W198F, W157F, or Y113S) did not strongly affect the appearance or intensity of the radical spectrum measured 30 s after initiating the reaction with HO, nor did it change the ∼270 s required for the radical signal to recede to ≤10% of its initial intensity. These results suggested Tyr-145 as the site of a catalytic radical involved in decarboxylating both propionates. Tyr-145 was accompanied by partial loss of the initially present Fe(III) EPR signal intensity, consistent with the possible formation of Fe(IV)=O. Site-specifically deuterated coproheme gave rise to a kinetic isotope effect of ∼2 on the decarboxylation rate constant, indicating that cleavage of the propionate Cβ-H bond was partly rate-limiting. The inferred mechanism requires two consecutive hydrogen atom transfers, first from Tyr-145 to the substrate Fe/HO intermediate and then from the propionate Cβ-H to Tyr-145.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27427433>Structural characterization of allomelanin from black oat.</a></h1><p>The brown to black coloration found in plants is due to the melanins, which have been relatively poorly investigated among the plant pigments. The aim of this work was to study the dark pigment extracted from the black oat hull with respect to composition and structure. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy were applied for the characterization of the pigment. UV-Vis spectroscopy revealed that the extracted material displays a broadband, structureless absorption profile a common feature of melanins. MALDI-TOF MS measurements demonstrated that oat melanin is a homopolymer built up from p-coumaric acid and consists mainly of low molecular weight (527-1499 Da) oligomers of 3-9 monomer units. The tetramer oligomer proved to be dominant. The results of the FT-IR analysis indicated that oat melanin is a fully conjugated aromatic system containing tetrasubstituted aromatic rings linked by CC coupling. The in vitro preparation of melanin from p-coumaric acid by horseradish peroxidase was performed for comparison. The resulting polymer consisted of oligomers of 4-9 monomer units similarly to those in oat melanin. However, the building blocks proved to be connected to each other via COC linkages in contrast with the CC linkages in oat melanin.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using this strategy, the optimum strain was capable of producing 35.02 mg/L of resveratrol from  in a single medium. The strategy described here paves the way to the development of a simple and economical process for microbial production of resveratrol and other similar stilbene chemicals.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to separate diabetes-associated from obesity-associated metabolite alterations in plasma and study the impact of metabolically important tissues on plasma metabolite concentrations.Two obese mouse models were studied; one exclusively with obesity (ob/ob) and another with type 2 diabetes (db/db). Both models have impaired leptin signalling as a cause for obesity, but the different genetic backgrounds determine the susceptibility to diabetes. In these mice, we profiled plasma, liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue via semi-quantitative GC-MS and quantitative liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS for a wide range of metabolites.Metabolite profiling identified 24 metabolites specifically associated with diabetes but not with obesity. Among these are known markers such as 1,5-anhydro-D-sorbitol, 3-hydroxybutyrate and the recently reported marker glyoxylate. New metabolites in the diabetic model were lysine, O-phosphotyrosine and branched-chain  . We also identified 33 metabolites that were similarly altered in both models, represented by branched-chain amino  (BCAA) as well as glycine, serine, trans-4-hydroxyproline, and various lipid species and derivatives. Correlation analyses showed stronger associations for plasma amino  with adipose tissue metabolites in db/db mice compared with ob/ob mice, suggesting a prominent contribution of adipose tissue to changes in plasma in a diabetic state.By studying mice with metabolite signatures that resemble obesity and diabetes in humans, we have found new metabolite entities for validation in appropriate human cohorts and revealed their possible tissue of origin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27804059>Collagen Extract from Marine Finfish Scales as a Potential Mosquito Larvicide.</a></h1><p>Collagen is a peptide being utilized in medical, health care, nutrient and decorative industry. Marine fish scales are one of the good sources of collagen, which is extracted using the advanced enzymatic digestion method. Scales of Sardinella longiceps (Oil Sardine) have a high proportion of collagen. This product is well absorbed with broad adaptive values that encourage the inclusion of nutriments. In this paper, we have performed the isolation and characterization of collagen from S. longiceps fish scales. The unnecessary proteins on the surface of fish scales was removed by demineralization process. The fish scale collagen was extracted in two different methods: acid (acetic acid) and enzymatic (pepsin) technique. The molecular mass of the extracted collagen was determined using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The absorption spectra of the extracted collagen was measured to estimate its amino acid () content. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum showed the existence of bands corresponding to the collagen extracted from S. longiceps fish scale and the crystallinity of extracted collagen was obtained using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The morphological micrograph was also analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The anti-larval effect of the collagen extract was determined using mosquito larvae of Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) and the activity was statistically significant.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26868296>Prostaglandin I2 Receptor Agonism Preserves β-Cell Function and Attenuates Albuminuria Through Nephrin-Dependent Mechanisms.</a></h1><p>Discovery of common pathways that mediate both pancreatic β-cell function and end-organ function offers the opportunity to develop therapies that modulate glucose homeostasis and separately slow the development of diabetes complications. Here, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of pharmacological agonism of the prostaglandin I2 (IP) receptor in pancreatic β-cells and in glomerular podocytes. The IP receptor agonist MRE-269 increased intracellular 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), augmented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), and increased viability in MIN6 β-cells. Its prodrug form, selexipag, augmented GSIS and preserved islet β-cell mass in diabetic mice. Determining that this preservation of β-cell function is mediated through cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)/nephrin-dependent pathways, we found that PKA inhibition, nephrin knockdown, or targeted mutation of phosphorylated nephrin  residues 1176 and 1193 abrogated the actions of MRE-269 in MIN6 cells. Because nephrin is important to glomerular permselectivity, we next set out to determine whether IP receptor agonism similarly affects nephrin phosphorylation in podocytes. Expression of the IP receptor in podocytes was confirmed in cultured cells by immunoblotting and quantitative real-time PCR and in mouse kidneys by immunogold electron microscopy, and its agonism 1) increased cAMP, 2) activated PKA, 3) phosphorylated nephrin, and 4) attenuated albumin transcytosis. Finally, treatment of diabetic endothelial nitric oxide synthase knockout mice with selexipag augmented renal nephrin phosphorylation and attenuated albuminuria development independently of glucose change. Collectively, these observations describe a pharmacological strategy that posttranslationally modifies nephrin and the effects of this strategy in the pancreas and in the kidney.© 2016 by the American Diabetes Association.

It inhibits the activity of protein  kinases and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis pathway. Here, we report that A77 1726, the active metabolite of leflunomide, inhibited the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and two other substrates of S6K1, insulin receptor substrate-1 and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 2, in an A375 melanoma cell line. A77 1726 increased the phosphorylation of AKT, p70 S6 (S6K1), ERK1/2, and MEK through the feedback activation of the IGF-1 receptor-mediated signaling pathway. In vitro kinase assay revealed that leflunomide and A77 1726 inhibited S6K1 activity with IC50 values of approximately 55 and 80 μM, respectively. Exogenous uridine partially blocked A77 1726-induced inhibition of A375 cell proliferation. S6K1 knockdown led to the inhibition of A375 cell proliferation but did not potentiate the antiproliferative effect of A77 1726. A77 1726 stimulated bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in A375 cells but arrested the cell cycle in the S phase, which was reversed by addition of exogenous uridine or by MAP kinase pathway inhibitors but not by rapamycin and LY294002 (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor). These observations suggest that A77 1726 accelerates cell cycle entry into the S phase through MAP kinase activation and that pyrimidine nucleotide depletion halts the completion of the cell cycle. Our study identified a novel molecular target of A77 1726 and showed that the inhibition of S6K1 activity was in part responsible for its antiproliferative activity. Our study also provides a novel mechanistic insight into A77 1726-induced cell cycle arrest in the S phase.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23957451>In vivo NMR studies of regional cerebral energetics in MPTP model of Parkinson's disease: recovery of cerebral metabolism with acute levodopa treatment.</a></h1><p>In this study, we have evaluated cerebral atrophy, neurometabolite homeostasis, and neural energetics in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin (MPTP) model of Parkinson's disease. In addition, the efficacy of acute l-DOPA treatment for the reversal of altered metabolic functions was also evaluated. Cerebral atrophy and neurochemical profile were monitored in vivo using MRI and (1) H MR Spectroscopy. Cerebral energetics was studied by (1) H-[(13) C]-NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with infusion of (13) C labeled [1,6(-13) C2 ]glucose or [2-(13) C]acetate. MPTP treatment led to reduction in paw grip strength and increased level of GABA and myo-inositol in striatum and olfactory bulb. (13) C Labeling of glutamate-C4 (1.93 ± 0.24 vs. 1.48 ± 0.06 μmol/g), GABA-C2 (0.24 ± 0.04 vs. 0.18 ± 0.02 μmol/g) and glutamaine-C4 (0.26 ± 0.04 vs. 0.20 ± 0.04 μmol/g) from [1,6-(13) C2 ]glucose was found to be decreased with MPTP exposure in striatum as well as in other brain regions. However, glutamine-C4 labeling from [2-(13) C]acetate was found to be increased in the striatum of the MPTP-treated mice. Acute l-DOPA treatment failed to normalize the increased ventricular size and level of metabolites but recovered the paw grip strength and (13) C labeling of amino  from [1,6-(13) C2 ]glucose and [2-(13) C]acetate in MPTP-treated mice. These data indicate that brain energy metabolism is impaired in Parkinson's disease and acute l-DOPA therapy could temporarily recover the cerebral metabolism. Cerebral atrophy, neurometabolite homeostasis, and neural energetics have been evaluated in an MPTP model of Parkinson's disease using MRI, in vivo (1) H MRS and (1) H-[(13) C]-NMR spectroscopy, respectively. MPTP treatment led to reduced paw grip strength and neuronal function. Acute Levodopa treatment was able to recover the diminished motor function and cerebral function.
