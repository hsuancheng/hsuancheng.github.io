Studies showed that shifting of oxidized lipids-induced inflammatory macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype by promoting oxidative metabolism attenuated atherosclerosis progression. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether metformin, which has ameliorated atherosclerosis in animal models and clinical trials, modulated oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) induced inflammatory status in macrophages by regulating cellular oxidative metabolism.Murine raw264.7 macrophages were incubated with Ox-LDL (50 μg/mL) in the presence or absence of metformin (15 μmol/L) for 24 h. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the transcription of classically activated (M1) pro-inflammatory and alternatively activated () anti-inflammatory markers and mitochondrial DNA copy numbers. Cellular reactive  species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane potential were detected by immunofluorescence. Cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, glucose uptake, and lactic acid production were measured by commercial kit and normalized to cellular lysates. Western blotting analysis was performed to detect the expression of mitochondrial fusion/fission related proteins, enzymes mediating lipid metabolism and signaling pathway of glucose transport. Differences between groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance.Metformin improved Ox-LDL-impaired anti-inflammatory phenotype in raw264.7 macrophages as shown by up-regulated transcription of anti-inflammatory markers including interleukin 10 (0.76 ± 0.04 vs. 0.94 ± 0.01, P = 0.003) and Resistin-like molecule alpha (0.67 ± 0.08 vs. 1.78 ± 0.34, P = 0.030). Conversely, Ox-LDL-diminished phosphorylation of Akt was up-regulated by metformin treatment (0.47 ± 0.05 vs. 1.02 ± 0.08, P = 0.040), associated with an improvement of mitochondrial function, characterized by decreased ROS generation (2.50 ± 0.07 vs. 2.15 ± 0.04, P = 0.040), increased lipid oxidation, and elevated cellular ATP production (0.026 ± 0.001 vs. 0.035 ± 0.003, P = 0.020). Moreover, metformin-mediated Akt activation increased Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) phosphorylation (0.51 ± 0.04 vs. 1.03 ± 0.03, P = 0.0041), promoted membrane translocation of glucose transporter 1, and increased glucose influx into the cells (4.78 ± 0.04 vs. 5.47 ± 0.01, P < 0.001).This study suggested that targeting macrophage metabolism with new or existing drugs had therapeutic potential for the prevention and treatment of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769285>Tumoral NOX4 recruits  tumor-associated macrophages via ROS/PI3K signaling-dependent various cytokine production to promote NSCLC growth.</a></h2><p>-type tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) infiltration contributes to cancer malignant progression. However, the mechanisms for controlling recruitment and  polarization of macrophages by cancer cells are largely unclear. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) is abundantly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and mediates cancer progression. NOXs are in close relation with cancer-related inflammation, nevertheless, whether tumoral NOXs influence microenvironmental macrophages remains undentified. This study found that there was a close association between NOX4 expression and macrophage chemotaxis in patients with NSCLC analyzed using TCGA RNA-sequencing data. NOX4 in NSCLC cells (A549 and Calu-1 cell lines) efficiently enhanced murine peritoneal macrophage migration and induces  polarization. Immunohistochemical analysis of clinical specimens confirmed the positive correlation of NOX4 and CD68 or CD206. The mechanical study revealed that tumoral NOX4-induced reactive  species (ROS) stimulated various cytokine production, including CCL7, IL8, CSF-1 and VEGF-C, via PI3K/Akt signaling-dependent manner. Blockade of the function of these cytokines reversed NOX4 effect on macrophages. Specifically, the results showed that tumoral NOX4-educated  macrophages exhibited elevated JNK activity, expressed and released HB-EGF, thus facilitating NSCLC proliferation in vitro. Pretreatment of macrophages with JNK inhibitor blocked tumoral NOX4-induced HB-EGF production in  macrophages. Finally, in a xenograft mouse model, overexpression of NOX4 in A549 cells enhanced the tumor growth. Elimination of ROS by NAC or inhibition of NOX4 activity by GKT137831 suppressed tumor growth accompanied by reduction in macrophage infiltration and the percentage of  macrophages. In conclusion, our study indicates that tumoral NOX4 recruits  TAMs via ROS/PI3K signaling-dependent various cytokine production, thus contributing NSCLC cell growth.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, how molecular events regulate mitochondrial activity to integrate regulation of iron metabolism and macrophage phenotype remains unclear. Here, we explored the important role of the actin-regulatory protein glia maturation factor-γ (GMFG) in the regulation of cellular iron metabolism and macrophage phenotype. We found that GMFG was downregulated in murine macrophages by exposure to iron and hydrogen peroxide. GMFG knockdown altered the expression of iron metabolism proteins and increased iron levels in murine macrophages and concomitantly promoted their polarization toward an anti-inflammatory  phenotype. GMFG-knockdown macrophages exhibited moderately increased levels of mitochondrial reactive  species (mtROS), which were accompanied by decreased expression of some mitochondrial respiration chain components, including the iron-sulfur cluster assembly scaffold protein ISCU as well as the antioxidant enzymes SOD1 and SOD2. Importantly, treatment of GMFG-knockdown macrophages with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine reversed the altered expression of iron metabolism proteins and significantly inhibited the enhanced gene expression of  macrophage markers, suggesting that mtROS is mechanistically linked to cellular iron metabolism and macrophage phenotype. Finally, GMFG interacted with the mitochondrial membrane ATPase ATAD3A, suggesting that GMFG knockdown-induced mtROS production might be attributed to alteration of mitochondrial function in macrophages. Our findings suggest that GMFG is an important regulator in cellular iron metabolism and macrophage phenotype and could be a novel therapeutic target for modulating macrophage function in immune and metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30803083>Artificially Reprogrammed Macrophages as Tumor-Tropic Immunosuppression-Resistant Biologics to Realize Therapeutics Production and Immune Activation.</a></h2><p>To engineer patient-derived cells into therapy-purposed biologics is a promising solution to realize personalized treatments. Without using gene-editing technology, a live cell-typed therapeutic is engineered for tumor treatment by artificially reprogramming macrophages with hyaluronic acid-decorated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (HIONs). This nanoparticle-assisted cell-reprogramming strategy demonstrates profound advantages, due to the combined contributions from the biological regulation of HIONs and the intrinsic nature of macrophages. Firstly, the reprogrammed macrophages present a substantial improvement in their innate capabilities, such as more effective tumor targeting and more efficient generation of bioactive components (e.g., reactive  species, bioactive cytokines) to suppress tumor growth. Furthermore, this cell therapeutic exhibits cytostatic/proapoptotic effects specific to cancer cells. Secondly, HIONs enable macrophages more resistant to the intratumoral immunosuppressive environment. Thirdly, the macrophages are endowed with a strong ability to prime in situ protumoral  macrophages into antitumor M1 phenotype in a paracrine-like manner. Consequently, a synergistic tumor-inhibition effect is achieved. This study shows that engineering nanomaterial-reprogrammed live cells as therapeutic biologics may be a more preferable option to the commonly used approaches where nanomaterials are administrated to induce bioresponse of certain cells in vivo.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The primary cultured microglia were treated with -hemoglobin (OxyHb) to mimic ICH in vitro. In this experiment, specific siRNA for Tim-3 and recombinant human TIM-3 were exploited both in vivo and in vitro.Tim-3 was increased in the brain after ICH, which mainly distributed in microglia, but not neurons and astrocytes. However, the blockade of Tim-3 by siRNA markedly reduced secretion of inflammatory factors, neuronal degeneration, neuronal cell death, and brain edema. Meanwhile, downregulation of Tim-3 promoted the transformation of microglia phenotype from M1 to  after ICH. Furthermore, upregulation of Tim-3 can increase the interaction between Tim-3 and Galectin-9 (Gal-9) and activate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) pathway after ICH. Increasing the expression of Tim-3 may be related to the activation of HIF-1α.Tim-3 may be an important link between neuroinflammation and microglia polarization through Tim-3/Gal-9 and TLR-4 signaling pathways which induced SBI after ICH.© 2019 The Authors.

For example, plants growing on point bars absorb and remove nutrients from the soil and water. However, if the point-bar plants are unregulated, in the fall and winter, plant debris will decompose, releasing nutrients that then enter the water body and cause eutrophication. Therefore, any harvesting should be managed. But how to harvest plants and how often to harvest them, and there is little research on these. In this study, the point bar at Qingcaosha Reservoir was used to study the effects of three plant harvesting modes (M1: unharvested; : one harvest in the fall; and M3: one harvest in summer and one in the fall) on the removal of nitrogen (N) from point-bar soil. The largest amount of N was removed by the plants when the M3 mode was used (26.93 g/m). However, the  mode removed the most N from the soil during the plant growth season (81.62 g/m), which implied that the nitrification and denitrification effects of soil microorganisms make the largest contribution to N removal from this point-bar soil. The nitrification and denitrification activity of microorganisms was higher for  than for M1 and M3 in the following year. Additionally, summer harvesting (M3) had a negative effect on nitrification efficiency in the current season because anaerobic bacteria in the soil significantly increased and nitrifying bacteria significantly decreased after harvesting. However, after a period of recovery, the number of microbial nitrifiers increased again and nitrification activity rose in the following year. The reduction in  supply after harvesting may be the main reason for low nitrification in the current season, but it was beneficial to nitrification and denitrification in the following year because there was luxuriant plant growth. Therefore, when considering both the current season and the following year, harvesting should not be too frequent and one harvest in the fall () led to the largest removal of N from the soil.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

An increasing trend in conductivity of Sn-doped C12A7:e- composites was observed at 300 K: 24 S cm-1, 68 S cm-1, 190 S cm-1 and 290 S cm-1, at doping levels of x = 0.20, 0.40, 0.80, and 1, respectively. Sn-doped C12A7:e-, with and without reduced graphene oxide (rGO), acts as a less expensive and highly active and durable electrocatalyst in the  reduction reaction (ORR) for fuel cells. In the case of C12A7-xSnx:e- (where x = 1), calculated onset potential and current density were comparable to the commercially available 20% Pt/C electrode. Moreover, significant improvement was observed for Sn-doped C12A7:e- (doping level x = 1) with rGO composite. The ORR current density was about 5.9 mA cm-2, which was higher than that of Pt/C (5.2 mA cm-2). Our investigation of the effect of cation doping on structural and electrical properties of Sn-doped C12A7:e- composites shows that these results manifested the feasibility of this sol-gel method for different element doping. Furthermore, the as-prepared promising non-noble metal catalysts (NNMCs), viz., Sn-doped C12A7:e- composite materials, possess intrinsic long-time stability and excellent methanol resistance toward ORR in alkaline media and may serve as a promising alternative to Pt/C materials for ORR in its widespread implementation in fuel cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30320909>Immune-endocrine responses and physical performance of master athletes during the sports season.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of a training season (approximately 7 months) on physiological and salivary immune-endocrine markers in master athletes. Nine male master athletes were evaluated at the beginning of the season (M1) and a week after the main official competition at the end of the sports season (). The controlled variables included Maximal  consumption, anthropometric, physiological, and salivary immune-endocrine markers. Master athletes presented a reduced percentage of fat mass and increased lean body mass at the end of the season. VO values were similar at M1 and , while the maximal heart rate and lactate were lower at . No differences were observed in Immunoglobulin A and cortisol levels between moments, whereas testosterone levels and the testosterone/cortisol ratio were significantly lower at the end of the season. The results suggest that maintaining regular training throughout life has positive effects on body composition and improves physiological fitness. However, care should be taken to avoid fatigue as indicated by lower testosterone levels at the end of the season.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545064>Mitochondrial Hyperactivation and Enhanced ROS Production are Involved in Toxicity Induced by Oncogenic Kinases Over-Signaling.</a></h2><p>Targeted therapy is an effective, rational, and safe approach to solid and hematological tumors treatment. Unfortunately, a significant fraction of patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) relapses mainly because of gene amplification, mutations, or other bypass mechanisms. Recently a growing number of papers showed how, in some cases, resistance due to oncogene overexpression may be associated with drug addiction: cells able to proliferate in the presence of high TKI doses become also TKI dependent, undergoing cellular stress, and apoptosis/death upon drug withdrawal. Notably, if a sub-cellular population survives TKI discontinuation it is also partially re-sensitized to the same drug. Thus, it is possible that a subset of patients relapsing upon TKI treatment may benefit from a discontinuous therapeutic schedule. We focused on two different hematologic malignancies, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), both successfully treatable with TKIs. The two models utilized (LAMA and SUP-) differed in having oncogene overexpression as the sole cause of drug resistance (CML), or additionally carrying kinase domain mutations (ALCL). In both cases drug withdrawal caused a sudden overload of oncogenic signal, enhanced mitochondria activity, induced the release of a high amount of reactive  species (ROS), and caused genotoxic stress and massive cell death. In LAMA cells (CML) we could rescue the cells from death by partially blocking downstream oncogenic signaling or lowering ROS detrimental effect by adding reduced glutathione.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31080796>Macrophage-Driven Biomaterial Degradation Depends on Scaffold Microarchitecture.</a></h2><p> tissue engineering is a technology in which non-cellular biomaterial scaffolds are implanted in order to induce local regeneration of replaced or damaged tissues. Degradable synthetic electrospun scaffolds are a versatile and promising class of biomaterials for various  tissue engineering applications, such as cardiovascular replacements. Functional  tissue regeneration depends on the balance between endogenous neo-tissue formation and scaffold degradation. Both these processes are driven by macrophages. Upon invasion into a scaffold, macrophages secrete reactive  species (ROS) and hydrolytic enzymes, contributing to oxidative and enzymatic biomaterial degradation, respectively. This study aims to elucidate the effect of scaffold microarchitecture, i.e., μm-range fiber diameter and fiber alignment, on early macrophage-driven scaffold degradation. Electrospun poly-ε-caprolactone-bisurea (PCL-BU) scaffolds with either 2 or 6 μm (Ø) isotropic or anisotropic fibers were seeded with THP-1 derived human macrophages and cultured  for 4 or 8 days. Our results revealed that macroph age-induced oxidative degradation in particular was dependent on scaffold microarchitecture, with the highest level of ROS-induced lipid peroxidation, NADPH oxidase gene expression and degradation in the 6 μm Ø anisotropic group. Whereas, biochemically polarized macrophages demonstrated a phenotype-specific degradative potential, the observed differences in macrophage degradative potential instigated by the scaffold microarchitecture could not be attributed to either distinct M1 or  polarization. This suggests that the scaffold microarchitecture uniquely affects macrophage-driven degradation. These findings emphasize the importance of considering the scaffold microarchitecture in the design of scaffolds for  tissue engineering applications and the tailoring of degradation kinetics thereof.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30724146>Hybrid procedure of right ventricle outflow tract stenting in small infants with pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect: early and mid-term results from a single centre.</a></h2><p>IntroductionPulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect, major aorto-pulmonary collateral arteries, and pulmonary arteries hypoplasia are rare and complex congenital defects that require early interventions to relieve cyanosis and enhance the growth of native pulmonary arteries. The treatment of these patients is still controversial. Surgical techniques require cardiopulmonary bypass which is poorly tolerated by small infants. Percutaneous techniques such as radiofrequency perforation can be challenging. The hybrid technique consists of perventricular stenting of the right ventricle outflow tract through medial sternotomy, to restore native pulmonary flow.We retrospectively reviewed the cardiovascular database of our centre in order to analyse our experience in hybrid procedure. We detected six patients who underwent hybrid first approach between November 2007 and December 2015. We report our early results and mid-term outcomes.Median age at the procedure was 26 days, median weight was 3150 g, and median Nakata index was 52 mm2/. All procedures were successful except for one: this patient underwent a surgical shunt. No immediate and early deaths or major complications occurred and  saturation levels increased in all the patients. Patients were followed up for a period of 12-103 months, and four of them underwent a procedure of unifocalisation at the mean age of 12.5 months.We reported data from the largest series of patients who underwent this hybrid procedure.

In a simple human inflammatory response, such as acute crystal arthropathy, macrophages progress linearly through M1 and  phases; however, in chronic inflammatory responses, such as atherosclerosis and Diabetic Nephropathy (DN), both M1 and  macrophages may coexist, leading to persistent inflammation and fibrosis. A key macrophage receptor that regulates conversion from M1 to  is CD163, the hemoglobin scavenger receptor. Scavenging of hemoglobin:haptoglobin (Hb:Hp) complexes via CD163 leads to nuclear translocation of the transcription factor Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2), upregulation of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 cytoprotective protein, and release of interleukin (IL)-10 anti-inflammatory cytokine; IL-10 is then linked in a positive feedback loop to further CD163 expression. The potency of this M1/ switching pathway is underscored by the fact that human Hp2 polymorphisms are associated with worsened clinical outcomes for diabetic complications, including DN. Parallel observations in animals show that HO-1 activation by hemin protects against DN in rodent models of diabetes. This review discusses the concept that Nrf2/HO-1 acts as a 'therapeutic funnel' through which a range of natural and synthetic anti-oxidants may drive M1 to  switching and improved kidney function in diabetes. We also discuss our observations on the evolution of M1/ phenotypes in a human model of wound healing which has presented intriguing potential drug targets for DN, such as eotaxin/CCR3.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30180849>Nrf2 activation drive macrophages polarization and cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition during interaction.</a></h2><p>The  phenotype of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) inhibits the anti-tumor inflammation, increases angiogenesis and promotes tumor progression. The transcription factor Nuclear Factor (erythroid-derived 2)-Like 2 (Nrf2) not only modulates the angiogenesis but also plays the anti-inflammatory role through inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines expression; however, the role of Nrf2 in the cancer cell and macrophages interaction is not clear.Hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Hep G2 and Huh 7) and pancreatic cancer cells (SUIT2 and Panc-1) were co-cultured with monocytes cells (THP-1) or peripheral blood monocytes derived macrophages, then the phenotype changes of macrophages and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of cancer cells were detected. Also, the role of Nrf2 in cancer cells and macrophages interaction were investigated.In this study, we found that cancer cells could induce an -like macrophage characterized by up-regulation of CD163 and Arg1, and down-regulation of IL-1b and IL-6 through Nrf2 activation. Also, Nrf2 activation of macrophages promoted VEGF expression. The Nrf2 activation of macrophages correlated with the reactive  species induced by cancer cells derived lactate. Cancer cells educated macrophages could activate Nrf2 of the cancer cells, in turn, to increase cancer cells epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through paracrine VEGF. These findings suggested that Nrf2 played the important role in the cancer cells and macrophages interaction.Macrophage Nrf2 activation by cancer cell-derived lactate skews macrophages polarization towards an -like phenotype and educated macrophages activate Nrf2 of the cancer cells to promote EMT of cancer cells.

Oleaginous yeast Trichosporon fermentans can consume organic materials in SOR wastewater to synthesize microbial oil, which achieves the purpose of SOR wastewater resource utilization. The effective harvesting technology of oleaginous yeasts can improve the utilization efficiency. In this study, Paecilomyces sp. -1 with high flocculating activity was isolated. The flocculants produced by -1 (MBF2-1) include 75% (w/w) polysaccharides, rely on cations, and display the flocculation percentage of above 77% in the range of pH 2-11. Especially under alkaline conditions, the flocculation percentage can be kept above 97%. The results of scanning electron microscope observation and zeta potential measurements suggested that the bridging, net trapping, and sweeping were the main flocculation mechanism of MBF2-1. MBF2-1 could flocculate T. fermentans that was used to reduce the organic matter in SOR wastewater and to produce microbial oil. Under the optimum conditions, the flocculation percentage of MBF2-1 against T. fermentans from SOR wastewater can reach 95%. Fatty acid content percent in microbial oil from T. fermentans was not almost affected by flocculation of MBF2-1. Moreover, MBF2-1 can further remove 55% and 53% of COD and oil content in the fermented SOR wastewater, respectively.

Despite appropriate therapy, the disease results in significant morbidity/mortality and substantial treatment costs. Several studies published in the early 1900s demonstrated the effective use of low-dose X-ray radiotherapy (RT) for the treatment of many diverse inflammatory conditions and diseases (eg, gas gangrene, sinus infections, arthritis, tendonitis, and serious inflammatory lung conditions). The mechanism by which therapeutic RT doses produce positive patient outcomes is related at least in part to its capacity to induce tissue-based anti-inflammatory responses. This action is due to the polarization of macrophages to an anti-inflammatory or  phenotype via optimized low-dose RT. Low-dose RT has the potential to significantly reduce debilitating surgeries and aggressive treatments required for NF, providing a 3-prong benefit in terms of patient mortality, length of hospitalization stays, and cost of health care (both short term and long term). Low cost and easy availability of low-dose RT makes it a potentially useful option for patients of every age-group.

Long non-coding RNA taurine up-regulated gene 1 (lncRNA TUG1) is widely expressed in adult brain and has been reported to participate in multiple biological processes associated with nervous system diseases. However, the role of TUG1 in microglial activation remains unidentified. BV-2 microglial cells were cultured  and TUG1 siRNA was used to knock down its RNA level. Microglial cells were subjected to -glucose deprivation (OGD) for 4 h following TUG1 siRNA or scramble siRNA transient transfection. After 24 h reoxygenation, TUG1 level and microglial M1/ phenotype, as well as releasing inflammatory cytokines and their role to viability of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), ELISA, immunofluorescence and western blot. In addition, miR-145a-5p, a putative microRNA to bind with TUG1 by bioinformatics analysis, was simultaneously examined, then the interaction of TUG1 with miR-145a-5p and the potential involvement of NF-κB pathway were further evaluated by RNA-RNA pull-down assay and western blot. The cellular level of TUG1 was transiently up-regulated in microglial cells 24 h after OGD treatment, with an inverse correlation to downregulated miR-145a-5p. TUG1 knockdown drove microglial M1-like to -like phenotypic transformation with reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, TNF-α; interleukin-6, IL-6) and incremental release of anti-inflammatory cytokine (interleukin-10, IL-10), as a result, promoted the survival of SH-SY5Y cells. Meanwhile, TUG1 knockdown prevented OGD-induced activation of NF-κB pathway as well, represented by decreased ratios of p-p65/p65 and p-IκBα/IκBα proteins. Furthermore, we found that TUG1 could physically bind to miR-145a-5p while miR-145a-5p inhibitor abolished the protective effects of TUG1 knockdown through activation of NF-κB pathway, suggesting a negative interaction between TUG1 and miR-145a-5p. Our study demonstrated that lncRNA TUG1, sponging miR-145a-5p with negative interaction, could regulate microglial polarization and production of inflammatory cytokines at a relatively early stage after OGD insult, where NF-κB pathway might be involved, possibly providing a promising therapeutic target against inflammatory injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994313>Body Mass Index does not affect intraoperative goal-directed fluid requirements.</a></h2><p>Perioperative normovolemia is a major determinant of tissue  availability and postoperative outcome. Thus, adequate volume replacement therapy remains an essential part of perioperative management. Nevertheless, volume optimization in overweight and obese surgical patients with alterations in cardiovascular function, peripheral perfusion, and body composition remains challenging. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that Body Mass Index (BMI) correlates with fluid requirements during goal-directed management. Furthermore, we evaluated subcutaneous tissue  tension (PsqO2) as an indicator of intravascular volume status and peripheral perfusion.Ninety women, undergoing open gynecologic surgery, were assigned to three groups according to their BMI, (lean: BMI 18.5 to 24.9 kg/, overweight: BMI 25 to 29.9 kg/, obese: BMI>30 kg/). Esophageal Doppler monitoring guided intraoperative crystalloid administration. Tissue  tension was measured with a polarographic electrode in the subcutaneous tissue of the upper arm and served as a secondary outcome parameter.BMI and fluid requirements did not correlate (r=0.093, P=0.384). Total amounts of administered crystalloids were comparable. Lean patients received 2223±1811 mL in total, while overweight patients received 1866±1261 mL.

The association between OSA in late pregnancy and metabolic biomarkers remains poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that OSA in pregnant women with obesity is positively correlated with 24-hour patterns of glycemia and IR despite controlling for diet.Pregnant women (32 to 34 weeks' gestation; body mass index, 30 to 40 kg/) wore a continuous glucose monitor for 3 days. OSA was measured in-home by WatchPAT 200™ [apnea hypopnea index (AHI),  desaturation index (ODI; number per hour)]. Fasting blood was collected followed by a 2-hour, 75-g, oral glucose tolerance test to measure IR. Association between AHI and 24-hour glucose area under the curve (AUC) was the powered outcome.Of 18 women (29.4 ± 1.4 years of age [mean ± SEM]), 12 (67%) had an AHI ≥5 (mild OSA). AHI and ODI were correlated with 24-hour glucose AUC (r = 0.50 to 0.54; P ≤ 0.03) and mean 24-hour glucose (r = 0.55 to 0.59; P ≤ 0.02). AHI and ODI were correlated with estimated hepatic IR (r = 0.59 to 0.74; P < 0.01), fasting free fatty acids (fFFAs; r = 0.53 to 0.56; P < 0.05), and waking cortisol (r = 0.49 to 0.64; P < 0.05).Mild OSA is common in pregnant women with obesity and correlated with increased glycemic profiles, fFFAs, and estimates of hepatic IR. OSA is a potentially treatable target to optimize maternal glycemia and metabolism, fetal fuel supply, and pregnancy outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536985>Extremely Low Birth Weight Predisposes to Impaired Renal Health: A Pooled Analysis.</a></h2><p>A number of studies examined the association between preterm delivery and kidney size and function later in life. However, the number of cases in published cohort studies is low. This study was aimed at performing a multicenter collaboration to pool data to obtain more accurate results to quantify the extent of renal impairment in former extremely low birth weight (ELBW; <1,000 g) children.We performed a subject-level meta-analysis to pool data from Cracow (64 cases/34 controls) and Leuven (93 cases/87 controls). We assessed and analyzed cystatin C, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), ultrasound kidney length, and blood pressure (BP) in 11-year-old ELBW children compared with controls born at term. The prevalence of hypertension (HT) and prehypertension (preHT) in both groups was also analyzed.The study group comprised 157 former ELBW children (gestational age 23-33 weeks and birth weight 430-1,000 g) and 123 children born at term. Former ELBW children had lower mean eGFR (100.62 ± 16.53 vs. 111.89 ± 15.26 mL/min/1.73 ; p < 0.001), smaller absolute kidney length (8.56 ± 0.78 vs. 9.008 ± 0.73 cm; <0.001), and higher systolic (111.8 ± 9.8 vs. 107.2 ± 9.07 mm Hg; p = 0.01) and diastolic (68.6 ± 6.8 vs. 66.3 ± 7.7 mm Hg; p = 0.03) BP. Smaller renal size in former ELBW children was positively associated with lower birth weight, shorter gestational age, and severity of perinatal complications (intraventricular hemorrhage, length of stay, mechanical ventilation, and  therapy).ELBW is associated with lower eGFR and a high frequency of preHT and HT.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

The effect of impregnation with CaCl2 on the thermal and chemical properties and morphology of bamboo fiber was determined using thermogravimetric and differential thermogravimetric analyses, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The pore structure of the carbonized bamboo fiber was investigated. The results revealed that bamboo fiber pretreated with 5% CaCl2 (BFCa5) showed a downward shift in the temperature of the maximum rate of weight loss253°C and increase in char residue to 31.89%. BFCa5 was expected to undergo dehydration under the combined effect of -rich atmosphere and CaCl2 catalysis from 210°C, and cellulose decomposition would be remarkable at 250°C. Pretreatment with 5% CaCl2 promoted the formation of porous structure of the carbonized fiber, which exhibited a typical Type-IV isotherm, with the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area of 331.32 /g and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda adsorption average pore diameter of 13.6440 nm. Thus, CaCl2 was found to be an effective catalyst for the pyrolysis of bamboo fiber, facilitating the formation of porous carbonized fiber.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31104054>The Amount of Weight Loss Six Months after Bariatric Surgery: It Makes a Difference.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery, especially Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), has become the most frequently used therapy for morbid obesity.The aim of this study was to examine the effects of surgically induced weight loss on cardiopulmonary function 6 months after the procedure, as well as the effect of such an intervention on well-known risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.This is a cross-sectional study on 66 morbidly obese patients (BMI ≥40 or ≥35 kg/ with present comorbidities), comparing their cardiopulmonary function prior to and 6 months after RYGB surgery.The substantial amount of weight loss (29.80 ± 13.27 kg) after RYGB surgery was associated with significant reduction of comorbidities, especially diabetes and sedentary lifestyle (p = 0.005 and p = 0.002, respectively). Regarding functional capacity, there was significant increase in peak  uptake (VO2 peak, p = 0.003), duration of exercise testing, metabolic equivalents (exercise time and METs, p < 0.001), and in peak O2 pulse. These findings were particularly pronounced in a group of patients who had lost more than 18% of initial weight.Reduction of body weight after RYGB surgery is associated with significantly improved cardiorespiratory function 6 months after surgery, especially in patients who lost more than 18% of their initial body weight. In addition, substantial decreases in body weight were also associated with a reduction of cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, smoking, hypertriglyceridemia, and sedentary lifestyle.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

Microglial activation occurs after CNS injury, infection or disease. Prolonged microglial activation is detrimental to the CNS as they produce nitric oxide (NO), reactive  species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in neuronal cell dysfunction and death. Microglial activation is implicated in the neurological deficits following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and Alzheimer's disease. Intranasal insulin administration is a promising treatment of Alzheimer's disease and TBI. However, the exact effect of insulin on microglia is currently unclear. The goal of this study was therefore to examine the effect of insulin administration on activated microglia. The microglial cell line BV2 were exposed to a pro-inflammatory stimulus, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), followed by insulin administration. Outcome measures were conducted at 24 hours after treatment. In vitro assays quantified NO and ROS production. Western blot, immunocytochemistry and phagocytosis assay further examined the effect of insulin on microglial activity. Insulin treatment significantly reduced NO, ROS and TNFα production and increased phagocytic activity. Insulin treatment also significantly reduced iNOS expression, but had no significant effect on any other M1 or  macrophage polarization marker examined. These data suggest that insulin has very specific effects to reduce pro-inflammatory or chemoattractant properties of microglia, and this may be one mechanism by which insulin has beneficial effects in CNS injury or neurodegenerative conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29806673>[ uptake kinetics to assess cardiorespiratory fitness in obese patients].</a></h2><p>The evaluation of cardiorespiratory fitness (RCC) using maximal or peak  consumption (VO2), requires a high level of effort in obese patients. We propose a method to evaluate RCC using constant and moderate loads, called VO2 kinetics (tau).To determine the relationship between tau and peak VO2 in patients with obesity.Forty patients (87% females) aged 37 ± 12 years and with a body mass index (BMI) of 34.6 ± 4.0 kg/, were divided into two groups according to the applied workload (0.5 and 0.8 Watts/kg body mass) using a cycle ergometer and Cortex Metalyzer 3b equipment. The protocol was started with 6 minutes at constant load and then increments of 20-25 Watts every two min were made until determination of the peak VO2.The tau value was 51.8 ± 17.6 s, the absolute peak VO2 was 2.0 ± 0.7 L/min and the relative peak VO2 was 26.6 ± 30.0 ml/kg/min. There was a significant difference of tau medians between the group that used 0.5 and 0.8 Watts/kg (p = 0.002) and a significant inverse correlation between the absolute peak VO2 and the tau value for a load of 0.5 Watts/kg (rho = -0.415, p = 0.0327).The higher tau value, the lower the peak VO2 of an obese patient. It is suggested to apply loads of 0.5 Watts/kg for a VO2 kinetics test in obese patients or in subjects who do not wish to carry out higher physiological demands with a non-invasive and low risk procedure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30718686>Telmisartan induces browning of fully differentiated white adipocytes via  macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>Telmisartan is a well-known anti-hypertensive drug acting as an angiotensin 2 receptor blocker (ARB), but it also possesses partial PPARγ agonistic activity and induces insulin sensitivity. In the present study, we investigated the effects of telmisartan on macrophage polarization in association with its browning capacity, because PPARγ plays a key role in  polarization and in the browning of white adipocytes. Telmisartan induced  marker expression in murine macrophages concentration dependently, which was confirmed by flow cytometry. Both PPARγ and PPARδ activations appear to be responsible for telmisartan-induced  polarization. Telmisartan-treated conditioned medium (Tel-CM) of RAW264.7 cells and of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) induced the expressions of browning markers in fully differentiated white adipocytes with reduced lipid droplets, and increased  consumption rate and mitochondrial biogenesis. Levels of catecholamines (CA) released into the conditioned medium as well as intracellular tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNAs were found to be increased by telmisartan, and browning effects of Tel-CM were lessened by β3 receptor antagonist (L-748,337), suggesting CA secreted into CM play a role in Tel-CM-induced adipocyte browning. Acute administration of telmisartan (2 weeks, p.o.) to C57BL/6J mice increased the expressions of browning markers and  markers in white adipose tissues, whereas macrophage depletion by clodronate liposome pretreatment attenuated the telmisartan-induced expressions of browning markers. Together, telmisartan was observed to induce the browning of fully differentiated white adipocytes, at least in part, via PPAR activation-mediated  polarization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30716124>Towards a sampling design for characterizing habitat-specific benthic biodiversity related to  flux dynamics using Aquatic Eddy Covariance.</a></h2><p>The Aquatic Eddy Covariance (AEC) technique has emerged as an important method to quantify in situ seafloor metabolism over large areas of heterogeneous benthic communities, enabling cross-habitat comparisons of seafloor productivity. However, the lack of a corresponding sampling protocol to perform biodiversity comparisons across habitats is impeding a full assessment of marine ecosystem metabolism. Here, we study a range of coastal benthic habitats, from rocky-bed communities defined by either perennial macroalgae or blue mussel beds to soft-sediment communities comprised of either seagrass, patches of different macrophyte species or bare sand. We estimated that the maximum contribution to the AEC metabolic flux can be found for a seafloor area of approximately 80  with a 5 meter upstream distance of the instrument across all the habitats. We conducted a sampling approach to characterize and quantify the dominant features of biodiversity (i.e., community biomass) within the main seafloor area of maximum metabolic contribution (i.e., gross primary production and community respiration) measured by the AEC. We documented a high biomass contribution of the macroalgal Fucus vesiculosus, the seagrass Zostera marina and the macroinvertebrate Mytilus edulis to the net ecosystem metabolism of the habitats. We also documented a significant role of the bare sediments for primary productivity compared to vegetated canopies of the soft sediments. The AEC also provided insight into dynamic short-term drivers of productivity such as PAR availability and water flow velocity for the productivity estimate. We regard this study as an important step forward, setting a framework for upcoming research focusing on linking biodiversity metrics and AEC flux measurements across habitats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30217146>Treponema pallidum promotes macrophage polarization and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway to induce interleukin-1β production.</a></h2><p>The involvement of inflammasome activation and macrophage polarization during the process of syphilis infection remains unknown. In this study, A series of experiments were performed using human macrophages to research the role of NLRP3 inflammasome regulation in interleukin (IL)-1β production and its influence on macrophage polarization triggered by T. pallidum.The results showed that in M0 macrophages treated with T. pallidum, the M1-associated markers inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), IL-1β and TNF-α were upregulated, and the -associated markers CD206 and IL-10 were downregulated. In addition, we observed NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion in T. pallidum-treated macrophages, and the observed production of IL-1β occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, the secretion of IL-1β by macrophages after T. pallidum treatment was notably reduced by anti-NLRP3 siRNA and caspase-1 inhibitor treatment. NAC, KCl, and CA074-ME treatment also suppressed IL-1β release from T. pallidum-treated macrophages.These findings showed that T. pallidum induces M0 macrophages to undergo M1 macrophage polarization and elevate IL-1β secretion through NLRP3. Moreover, the process of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β production in macrophages in response to T. pallidum infection involves K efflux, mitochondrial ROS production and cathepsin release. This study provides a new insight into the innate immune response to T. pallidum infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30911326>Combination of shikonin with paclitaxel overcomes multidrug resistance in human ovarian carcinoma cells in a P-gp-independent manner through enhanced ROS generation.</a></h2><p>Shikonin (SKN), a naphthoquinone compound, is isolated from Chinese herbal medicine  root and has been studied as an anticancer drug candidate in human tumor models. This study is designed to investigate whether SKN can sensitize the therapeutic effect of paclitaxel (PTX) in drug-resistant human ovarian carcinoma cells.Human ovarian carcinoma A2780 cell along with the paired PTX-resistant A2780/PTX cells were used. The effects of SKN, PTX or their combination on cell viability were conducted using Sulforhodamine B assay. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression was analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with P-gp-FITC anti-body. P-gp activity was determined by a fluorometric MDR assay kit or a rhodamine 123-based efflux assay, respectively. Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry after Annexin V-FITC/PI co-staining. The effect of SKN, PTX or their combination on reactive  species (ROS) generation and expression of pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) were investigated using flow cytometry or western blotting, respectively. PKM2 activity was detected by a Pyruvate Kinase Assay Kit.SKN/PTX co-treatment led to synergistically enhanced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in PTX-resistant ovarian cancer cells, indicating the circumvention of multidrug resistance (MDR) of PTX by SKN. Further study indicated that the MDR reversal effect of SKN was independent of inhibiting activity of the efflux transporter P-gp. Notably, SKN/PTX significantly increased the generation of intracellular ROS in A2780/PTX cells, and scavenging intracellular ROS blocked the sensitizing effects of SKN in PTX-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in A2780/PTX cells, but not in A2780 cells. Furthermore, SKN/PTX-induced downregulation of PKM2 (a key enzyme in glycolysis) and the suppression of its activity were inhibited by a ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), suggesting that the synergy of the SKN/PTX combination may be not rely on PKM2 suppression.These results reveal a P-gp-independent mechanism through ROS generation for the SKN/PTX combination to overcome MDR in ovarian cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31246961>Influenza  virus-like particle vaccination enhances protection in combination with avian influenza HA VLPs.</a></h2><p>Despite the ability to induce a broad range of cross protection, M2e5x virus-like particles (VLPs) alone provide limited vaccine efficacy and confer low efficacy of protection against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) infection in chickens. Avian influenza hemagglutinin (HA) has been a major antigenic target that enhances humoral immunity, but the efficacy of avian HA-based vaccines against HPAIV needs to be further improved. In this study, we evaluated the vaccine efficacy induced by combination of conserved tandem repeat M2e5x VLPs and HA VLPs against an avian influenza virus. We found that combinatorial vaccine elicited higher levels of reassortant H5N1 (rgH5N1) virus-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgA antibody responses compared to M2e5x VLPs in sera and lungs of mice. Combinatorial VLPs vaccination induced higher levels of CD8+ T cell and germinal center B cell responses in lung and spleen compared to M2e5x VLPs. Combinatorial VLPs vaccination showed significantly reduced inflammatory responses and lung viral loads upon rgH5N1 virus challenge infection, resulting in less body weight loss compared to M2e5x VLPs alone. These results indicate that immune responses to both M2e and HA might provide a strategy of vaccination inducing enhanced protection against avian influenza virus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30538894>Radiation recall myelitis following paclitaxel chemotherapy: The first reported case.</a></h2><p>Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of the spine has become an increasingly utilized modality in the United States, most commonly for metastatic disease (McClelland et al., 2017). Spinal SBRT in patients with spinal instrumentation has been sparsely examined. We report a patient who developed myelitis following spinal SBRT to a region with existing hardware.A 55-year-old woman with Stage IV breast cancer developed a T4 vertebral body metastasis and underwent tumor debulking with posteriorly instrumented T3-T5 fusion. Postoperatively she proceeded with SBRT to the T3-T5 vertebral bodies, receiving 30 Gy in 6 Gy/fraction. Seven months later, she required paclitaxel chemotherapy (80 mg/ per cycle) for new liver metastases.Eight months following spine SBRT, four weeks after having started chemotherapy she developed intractable back pain and right lower extremity numbness which improved upon receiving steroids for weekly chemotherapy; the numbness subsequently spread to her left leg. Thoracic spine MRI revealed a 1.7 cm ovoid focus of T4-T5 spinal cord enhancement with extensive surrounding cord edema extending superiorly to C6-C7, consistent with radiation myelitis. Hyperbaric  moderately improved her symptoms; fortunately, she never developed motor symptomatology or bowel/bladder dysfunction. Thorough re-evaluation of the original thoracic spine SBRT plan revealed no deviations from the standard of care, nor did re-planning with alternate treatment planning software demonstrate any significant difference in maximum cord dosage than the original plan.The timing of symptomatology related to chemotherapy administration is consistent with radiation recall myelitis, which has yet to be reported following SBRT. Given the potentially disastrous consequences of myelitis, patients with metastatic disease previously treated with spine SBRT may be susceptible to developing myelitis if treated with paclitaxel chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30937653>Microbial diversity in a coastal environment with co-existing upwelling and mud-banks along the south west coast of India.</a></h2><p>Upwelling and mud banks are two prominent oceanographic features in the coastal waters along the south west coast of India during the southwest monsoon (MON) season. The present study investigates the microbial diversity in the coastal environments of Alappuzha, India, where upwelling and mud banks co-exist. Water samples were collected from three stations, M1, , and M3, on a weekly basis to estimate the physico-chemical parameters and microbial abundance (MA). Presence of cold waters (< 26 °C) with high nitrate (6-8 µM) and low dissolved  (5 µM) in the sub surface waters during monsoon (M) confirmed the presence of upwelling at all the three stations. Simultaneously, presence of unusually calm waters was seen at  alone during M indicating the formation of mud banks. The microbial diversity was determined from three stations, with distinct oceanographic conditions (M1: coastal reference station with only upwelling, : mud banks + upwelling, and M3: offshore reference station with only upwelling). The water samples were collected during two seasons, pre-monsoon (April) and M (July) and analysed using 16S rRNA-based Illumina high-throughput metagenomic sequencing. Proteobacteria was the most dominant phyla, followed by Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia in order, with variations in their relative abundance spatially and seasonally. Though the MA increased during M at all the stations, the relative abundance of most of the bacterial phyla except Proteobacteria decreased during M season. Interestingly, most of the sequences at  during mud banks were unclassified at the class level indicating the presence of unique microbial populations in this station. Prediction of metabolic activity revealed ammonia oxidation, nitrite reduction, sulphate reduction, xylan degradation, dehalogenation, chitin degradation, etc. as important functions. The metabolic activity throws light on the role of microbes in this environment thereby providing a system-scale perspective of microbial community interactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30704938>Hypoxia accelerates the progression of angiosarcoma through the regulation of angiosarcoma cells and tumor microenvironment.</a></h2><p>Angiosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor with a poor prognosis. It is known that hypoxic condition activates tumor progression in several cancers. Additionally, hypoxic tumor microenvironment accelerates immune escape. However, the presence and significance of hypoxia in angiosarcoma has not been adequately investigated.To study the role of hypoxia in the progression of angiosarcoma.The protein level of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in angiosarcoma was examined using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. To study the effect of hypoxia on tumor progression, cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation assays were performed in angiosarcoma cells. The influence of tumor cell supernatant in hypoxia from angiosarcoma cells on immune escape and angiogenesis was analysed to investigate the modulatory effect of hypoxia on tumor microenvironment of angiosarcoma. The molecular mechanism related to these results was investigated using immunoblotting and real time RT-PCR.HIF-1α protein was over-expressed in angiosarcoma tissues and cell lines under hypoxic conditions, and there was heterogeneity of  supply in angiosarcoma. Hypoxia enhanced the proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities and inhibited tube formation in angiosarcoma cells. Tumor cell supernatant in hypoxia from angiosarcoma cells activated the monocyte invasion ability, facilitated its differentiation into -like macrophages, and suppressed cell-adhesion. These in vitro results were compatible to the pathological findings of angiosarcoma patients.Hypoxia plays a major role in progression of angiosarcoma cells by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and by modulating the tumor microenvironment.Copyright © 2019 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

Here, using blood  level-dependent (BOLD) and diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we assessed changes in renal tissue oxygenation and fibrosis, respectively, and evaluated their correlation with prognosis for renal function.The study was conducted under a single-center, longitudinal, retrospective observational design. We examined the prognostic significance of T2* values of BOLD-MRI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values on DW-MRI and other clinical parameters. The rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated by linear regression analysis using changes in eGFR during the observation period.A total of 91 patients were enrolled, with a mean age of 55.8 ± 15.6 years. Among patients, 51 (56.0%) were males and 38 (41.8%) had diabetes mellitus. The mean eGFR was 49.2 ± 28.9 mL/min/1.73  and the mean observation period was 5.13 years. ADC values of DW-MRI but not T2* values of BOLD-MRI were well correlated with eGFR at the initial time point. The mean annual rate of decline in eGFR during the 5-year observation period was -1.92 ± 3.00 mL/min/1.73 . On multiple linear regression analysis, the rate of decline in eGFR was significantly correlated with eGFR at the start point, period average amount of proteinuria and T2* values, but not with ADC values (t = 2.980, P = 0.004).Reduced oxygenation as determined by low T2* values on BOLD-MRI is a clinically useful marker of CKD progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30257458>The Multifarious Functions of Pyruvate Kinase  in Oral Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>Head and neck cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), are the sixth most common malignancies worldwide. OSCC frequently leads to oral dysfunction, which worsens a patient's quality of life. Moreover, its prognosis remains poor. Unlike normal cells, tumor cells preferentially metabolize glucose by aerobic glycolysis. Pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes the final step in glycolysis, and the transition from PKM1 to PKM2 is observed in many cancer cells. However, little is known about PKM expression and function in OSCC. In this study, we investigated the expression of PKM in OSCC specimens and performed a functional analysis of human OSCC cells. We found that the / ratio was higher in OSCC cells than in adjacent normal mucosal cells and in samples obtained from dysplasia patients. Furthermore, PKM2 expression was strongly correlated with OSCC tumor progression on immunohistochemistry. PKM2 expression was higher during cell growth, invasion, and apoptosis in HSC3 cells, which show a high energy flow and whose metabolism depends on aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. PKM2 expression was also associated with the production of reactive  species (ROS) and integration of glutamine into lactate. Our results suggested that PKM2 has a variety of tumor progressive functions in OSCC cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30548333>miR-223 promotes regenerative myeloid cell phenotype and function in the demyelinated central nervous system.</a></h2><p>In the injured central nervous system, myeloid cells, including macrophages and microglia, are key contributors to both myelin injury and repair. This immense plasticity emphasizes the need to further understand the precise molecular mechanisms that contribute to the dynamic regulation of myeloid cell polarization and function. Herein, we demonstrate that miR-223 is upregulated in multiple sclerosis (MS) patient monocytes and the alternatively-activated and tissue-regenerating -polarized human macrophages and microglia. Using miR-223 knock-out mice, we observed that miR-223 is dispensable for maximal pro-inflammatory responses, but is required for efficient -associated phenotype and function, including phagocytosis. Using the lysolecithin animal model, we further demonstrate that miR-223 is required to efficiently clear myelin debris and promote remyelination. These results suggest miR-223 constrains neuroinflammation while also promoting repair, a finding of important pathophysiological relevance to MS as well as other neurodegenerative diseases.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940325>Effects of α-lipoic acid on LPS-induced neuroinflammation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation through the regulation of BV-2 microglial cells activation.</a></h2><p>Microglial cells are known as the main immune cells in the central nervous system, both regulating its immune response and maintaining its homeostasis. Furthermore, the antioxidant α-lipoic acid (LA) is a recognized therapeutic drug for diabetes because it can easily invade the blood-brain barrier. This study investigated the effect of α-LA on the inflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated BV-2 microglial cells. Our results revealed that α-LA significantly attenuated several inflammatory responses in BV-2 microglial cells, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin (IL)-6, and other cytotoxic molecules, such as nitric oxide and reactive  species. In addition, α-LA inhibited the LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK and p38 and its pharmacological properties were facilitated via the inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway. Moreover, α-LA suppressed the activation of NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes, multiprotein complexes consisting of NLRP3 and caspase-1, which are involved in the innate immune response. Finally, α-LA decreased the genes accountable for the M1 phenotype, IL-1β and ICAM1, whereas it increased the genes responsible for the  phenotype, MRC1 and ARG1.

We recently found that the ribonucleotide reductase (RR) subunit  is potentially regulated by the key oncogenic HGF/c-MET pathway in KSHV-related lymphoma cells. One of RR inhibitor, 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (3-AP) effectively induced apoptosis of KSHV+ lymphomas and suppressed tumor progression . In the current study, we found that 3-AP treatment selectively inhibited the proliferation of KSHV-infected endothelial cells, the major cellular components of KS, through inducing DNA damage, reducing the levels of intracellular iron and reactive  species (ROS) and increasing viral lytic gene expression. By using a KS-like nude mouse model, we found that 3-AP treatment significantly suppressed KSHV induced tumorigenesis . Taken together, our data demonstrate targeting RR by 3-AP may represent a promising strategy for improving the treatment of KS in future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995055>Ring-Shaped Polyoxometalates Possessing Multiple 3d Metal Cation Sites: [{M(OH)}{M(OH)}PWO(OCH)] (M = Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn).</a></h2><p>A ring-shaped polyoxometalate (POM), [PWO] (P8W48), formed by condensation of four hexavacant lacunary α-Dawson-type [α-PWO] units, is an attractive superlacunary compound possessing a large cavity (approximately 10 Å). Although the introduction of metal species into the cavity was attempted in aqueous media using the K/Li salt of P8W48, we encountered several challenges: excess metal species are required, and K and/or Li remain in the cavity. Therefore, controlling the number and arrangement of the introduced metal species proved difficult. In this study, we overcame the aforementioned problems by developing a novel method for introducing metal species in organic media by employing the organic-solvent-soluble tetra- n-butylammonium (TBA) salt of P8W48 (I, TBAH[PWO]·30HO). We began by synthesizing compound I via a cation exchange reaction of the K/Li salt of P8W48 with TBABr in aqueous nitric acid. Single crystals (I', TBAH[PWO]·20HO·2CHNO) were obtained by recrystallizing I from a nitromethane/toluene mixture in the presence of excess TBAOH. The bond valence sum values of I' showed that protons were located on the  atoms inside the ring, and thus highly reactive sites capable of reacting with metal species were selectively generated within the ring. When I was reacted with 8 equiv of 3d metal species (Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, or Zn) in an acetonitrile/1,2-dichloroethane mixture in the presence of TBAOH and methanol, a series of POMs with eight metal sites (II, TBAH[{M(OH)}{M(OH)}PWO(OCH)]· nHO· mCHCN, where M = Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) was synthesized. In II, two edge-sharing bis(square-pyramidal) {(μ-O)(M-OH)(μ-O)(M-OH)(μ-O)} and four isolated M(OH) sites were present within the cavity. During the metal introduction, two α-P2W12 units were converted into γ-P2W12 units, and unique α,γ,α,γ-type P8W48 frameworks were obtained.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29971298>Self-assembled heteropolyacid on nitrogen-enriched carbon nanofiber for vanadium flow batteries.</a></h2><p>A novel polyoxometalate-based electrode was developed by incorporating phosphotungstic acid (PWA) in nylon-6,6 nanofiber, followed by carbonization.

Evaluation of electrocatalytic properties toward V2+/V3+ and VO2+/VO2+ redox couples indicated promising advantages in electron transfer kinetics and increasing energy efficiency, particularly for the VO2+/VO2+ couple. Moreover, the developed electrode exhibited substantially improved energy efficiency (14% higher than that of pristine carbon felt) in the single cell vanadium redox flow battery.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of berberine, a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid used in traditional Chinese medicine, on energy expenditure, expression of the UCP1 gene, the cell stress protein inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), apoptosis genes, and macrophage phenotype (M1 and ) in white and brown adipose tissue in an obese mouse model fed a high-fat diet. MATERIAL AND METHODS Four-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (n=20) were divided into a high-fat diet group, a normal diet group, a group treated with berberine at 100 mg/kg/d in 0.9% normal saline, and a non-treated group. Whole-body fat mass, blood glucose, insulin resistance, and  expenditure during physical activity were measured. After 16 weeks, the mice were euthanized for examination of liver and adipose tissue. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis genes, thermogenic genes (including UCP1), and IRE1α, were investigated using immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), in white and brown adipose tissue. Magnetic cell sorting harvested M1 and  macrophages in adipose tissue. Clodronate liposomes were used to inhibit macrophage recruitment. RESULTS Berberine treatment in mice fed a high-fat diet increased energy metabolism, glucose tolerance, and expression of UCP1, and reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, macrophage recruitment, and resulted in  macrophage polarization in white adipose tissue. Polarized  macrophages showed reduced expression of apoptotic genes and IRE1α.

In this work, defect-free facilitated transport membranes based on poly(amide-12-b-ethylene oxide) (Pebax-2533) and tetra(-methoxylphenyl)porphyrin cobalt chloride (T(-OCH)PPCoCl) were fabricated in systematically varied compositions for O/N separation. T(-OCH)PPCoCl was introduced as carriers that selectively and reversibly interacted with O and facilitated O transport in the membrane. The T(-OCH)PPCoCl had good compatibility with the Pebax-2533 via the hydrogen bond interaction and formed a uniform and thin selective layer on the substrate. The O separation performance of the thin film composite (TFC) membranes was improved by adding a small amount of the T(-OCH)PPCoCl and decreasing the feed pressure. At the pressure of 0.035 MPa, the O permeability and O/N selectivity of the 0.6 wt % T(-OCH)PPCoCl/Pebax-2533 was more than 3.5 times that of the Pebax-2533 TFC membrane, which reached the 2008 Robeson upper bound.

In the mammalian brain, ischemia elicits a massive release of zinc from hippocampal neurons, and the extracellular zinc primes M1 microglia-by inducing reactive  species (ROS) generation-to enhance their production of proinflammatory cytokines, which ultimately results in short-term spatial memory impairment. Here, we examined how peridinin, a carotenoid in dinoflagellates, affects the zinc-enhanced inflammatory M1 phenotype of microglia. Treatment of microglia with 30-300 ng/mL peridinin caused a dose-dependent attenuation of zinc-enhanced interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) secretion when M1 activation was induced by lipopolysaccharide exposure. Moreover, peridinin inhibited the increase in ROS levels in zinc-treated microglia without directly interacting with zinc. Notably, when mice were administrated peridinin (20-200 ng/animal) intracerebroventricularly 5 min before cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, the peridinin treatment not only suppressed the increase in expression of IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and the microglial M1 surface marker CD16/32, but also protected the mice against ischemia-induced short-term spatial-memory impairment. Our findings suggest that peridinin prevents extracellular zinc-enhanced proinflammatory cytokine secretion from M1 microglia by inhibiting the increase in microglial ROS levels, and that this anti-inflammatory effect of peridinin might result in protection against deficits in short-term spatial memory.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Generally, lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced pro-inflammatory activated macrophages, known as M1 macrophages, display higher glycolysis. In contrast, interleukin-4 (IL-4)-skewed anti-inflammatory activated macrophages, known as  macrophages, mainly rely on oxidative phosphorylation for their bioenergetic demands. Emerging evidence reveals that these metabolic preferences further fine-tune macrophage polarization process, including signaling cascades and epigenetic reprogramming. Thus, specific nutrient microenvironments may affect inflammatory responses of macrophages by intervening these metabolic machineries. How to measure the metabolic switch of macrophages both in vitro and in vivo is an important issue for understanding immunometabolic regulations in macrophages. Here, we describe a basic protocol for examining how glutamine metabolism affects macrophage polarization by using the Extracellular Flux (XF96) Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience), which takes real-time measurements of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. We also present a detailed procedure for detecting the expression of inflammatory genes in polarized macrophages under glutamine-replete or -deprived conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890073>Excitatory pathway engaging glutamate, calcineurin, and NFAT upregulates IL-4 in ischemic neurons to polarize microglia.</a></h2><p>Excitotoxicity and microglia/macrophage over-activation are the important pathogenic steps in brain damage caused by ischemic stroke. Recent studies from our group suggest that the neurons in ischemic penumbra generate an anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-4 (IL-4). This neuron-produced IL-4 could subsequently convert surrounding microglia/macrophages to a reparative ()-phenotype. The present study was designed to establish the mechanisms by which neurons under transient ischemic condition produce/secrete IL-4. We employed primary rat cortical neurons and a validated in vitro ischemic injury model involving transient -glucose deprivation (OGD). We discovered that only sublethal OGD induces IL-4 production/secretion by neurons. We then showed that excitotoxic stimulus (an integral component of OGD-mediated damage) involving N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and not kainate receptor, triggers neuronal IL-4 production/release. Of note, oxidative stress or pro-apoptotic stimuli did not induce IL-4 production by neurons. Next, using the calcineurin inhibitor FK506, we implicated this phosphatase in activation of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT; a transcription factor activated through calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation) and propose that this pathway is involved in transcriptional upregulation of the IL-4 synthesis in NMDA-treated neurons. Finally, using a transfer of culture medium from NMDA-conditioned neuron to microglia, we showed that the neuronal IL-4 can polarize microglia toward a restorative, phagocytic phenotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29870966>A hybrid constructed wetland for organic-material and nutrient removal from sewage: Process performance and multi-kinetic models.</a></h2><p>A pilot-scale hybrid constructed wetland with vertical flow and horizontal flow in series was constructed and used to investigate organic material and nutrient removal rate constants for wastewater treatment and establish a practical predictive model for use. For this purpose, the performance of multiple parameters was statistically evaluated during the process and predictive models were suggested. The measurement of the kinetic rate constant was based on the use of the first-order derivation and Monod kinetic derivation (Monod) paired with a plug flow reactor (PFR) and a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR). Both the Lindeman, Merenda, and Gold (LMG) analysis and Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method were employed for identifying the relative importance of variables and their optimal multiple regression (MR). The results showed that the first-order-PFR (M) model did not fit the data (P > 0.05, and R < 0.5), whereas the first-order-CSTR (M) model for the chemical  demand (COD) and Monod-CSTR (M) model for the COD and ammonium nitrogen (NH-N) showed a high correlation with the experimental data (R > 0.5). The pollutant removal rates in the case of M were 0.19 m/d (COD) and those for M were 25.2 g/m∙d for COD and 2.63 g/m∙d for NH-N. By applying a multi-variable linear regression method, the optimal empirical models were established for predicting the final effluent concentration of five days' biochemical  demand (BOD) and NH-N. In general, the hydraulic loading rate was considered an important variable having a high value of relative importance, which appeared in all the optimal predictive models.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Radiobiological studies were performed at the molecular and cellular levels to provide insights into DNA damage and repair, and the apoptosis mechanism of cells that were exposed to different doses of X-ray irradiation (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.5, 15 and 20 Gy). Evidence of increased reactive  species (ROS), DNA double strand breaks (DSB), cellular apoptosis, G2/M phase proportion and inhibition of cell proliferation were observed following irradiation. Differences in the ROS amount and apoptotic percentages of cells between the 2 and 4 Gy groups were insignificant. Compared with 0 Gy, the expression of the apoptosis suppression protein B-cell lymphoma-2 was decreased following at increased irradiation doses. However, apoptosis-associated protein Bcl-2-associated X (Bax), caspase-9 and BH3 interacting domain death agonist (Bid) were elevated following irradiation, compared with the control group (0 Gy). Furthermore, the expression levels of Bax in the 6, 8, 10 and 12.5 Gy groups were significantly increased, compared with the other groups. Caspase-9 expression with 2, 4, 6 and 8 Gy were increased compared with other groups, and the Bid levels with 6 and 8 Gy were also increased compared with other groups. G2/M phase arrest was associated with the increase of checkpoint kinase 1 and reduction of cyclin dependent kinase 1. DNA damage repair was associated with the protein Ku70 in the 2, 8, 10, 12.5, 15 and 20 Gy groups were less than other group. Compared with other group, Ku80 levels were reduced in the 6 and 8 Gy groups, and Rad51 levels were reduced in the 2, 8 and 10 Gy groups. The expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α, c-Myc and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) demonstrated an increasing trend following irradiation in a dose-dependent manner, but the expression of pyruvate kinase , in the 2-10 Gy irradiation groups, and GLUT1, in the 12.5, 15 and 20 Gy irradiation groups, were reduced, compared with the other groups. Considering the DNA damage repair and apoptosis mechanisms at molecular and cellular levels, it was concluded that 2, 6, 8 and 10 Gy may be the optimal fractional dose that can promote cell apoptosis, and inhibit DNA damage repair and glycolysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30151521>6-Gingerol as an arginase inhibitor prevents urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis by reprogramming tumor supporting  macrophages to M1 phenotype.</a></h2><p>6-Gingerol (6-G) is the main bioactive component in Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe). The aim of this study was to explore the contribution of macrophage polarization in 6-G-associated anti-cancer effects. In a urethane-induced lung carcinogenic model, lung carcinogenesis was positively correlated with macrophage (F4/80+) infiltration in lung interstitial in the control group. Furthermore, higher numbers of arginase+/F4/80+  cells than iNOS+/F4/80+ M1 cells were observed in interstitial macrophages. Moreover, macrophage depletion by liposome-encapsulated clodronate (LEC) could significantly prevent lung carcinogenesis, whereas pexidartinib promoted lung carcinogenesis. After 6-G treatment, lung carcinogenesis was ameliorated with increased M1 macrophages and decreased  macrophages in the lung interstitial. ELISA showed that the levels of IFN-γ and IL-12 increased and the levels of IL-10 and TGF-β1 decreased in the alveolar cavity compared to those in the control group. Unexpectedly, the carcinogenesis-preventing efficacy of 6-G was promoted in LEC-treated mice, but completely aborted in pexidartinib-treated mice. In the in vitro experiment, 6-G reset the IL-4-induced arginase+  cells toward iNOS+ M1 cells and exhibited reduced levels of arginase 1 and ROS and elevated levels of L-arginine and NO. LEC and nor-NOHA selectively suppressed  macrophages but had a negligible effect on M1 macrophages, whereas pexidartinib decreased both  and M1 macrophages. The iNOS+ macrophage-promoting efficacy of 6-G was increased by LEC, but was completely eliminated by pretreatment with pexidartinib or nor-NOHA.  macrophage-resetting efficacy of 6-G was confirmed in a Lewis lung cancer allograft model. This study indicated a reprogramming effect of 6-G as an arginase inhibitor on tumor supporting macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29976873>Targeting the NLRP3 Inflammasome-Related Pathways via Tianeptine Treatment-Suppressed Microglia Polarization to the M1 Phenotype in Lipopolysaccharide-Stimulated Cultures.</a></h2><p>An increasing body of evidence postulates that microglia are the main mediators of inflammation-related disorders, including depression. Since activated microglia produce a wide range of pro- and anti-inflammatory factors, the modulation of M1/ microglial polarization by antidepressants may be crucial in the treatment of depression. The current paper aimed to investigate the impact of tianeptine on the microglia’s viability/death parameters, and on M1/ microglial activation in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms via which tianeptine affected the LPS-evoked changes were investigated. The results revealed that tianeptine had partially protective effects on the changes in microglia viability/death evoked by LPS. Tianeptine attenuated microglia activation by decreasing the expression of cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40), and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) markers, as well as the release of pro-inflammatory factors: interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and chemokine CC motif ligand 2 (CCL2), and the production of nitric oxide and reactive  species. In contrast, we did not observe an impact of tianeptine on  microglia measured by IL-4, IL-10, TGF-β, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) expression. Moreover, we demonstrated an inhibitory effect of tianeptine on the LPS-induced activation of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like (NOD-like) receptor pyrin-containing 3 inflammasome (NLRP3) inflammasome subunits, NLRP3 and caspase-1, as well as the ability of tianeptine to reduce Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) levels, as well as the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB). Collectively, we demonstrated that tianeptine has protective properties and inhibits M1 polarization, thus attenuating the production of inflammatory mediators. Moreover, we found that M1 microglia suppression may be related to the NLRP3 inflammasome and TLR4 signaling. These findings suggest that a better understanding of the multifaceted mechanisms of tianeptine action on microglia may increase the effectiveness of therapy, where inflammation is a central hallmark.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30440963>Mathematical Modeling of Arterial Blood Pressure Using Photo- Plethysmography Signal in Breath-hold Maneuver.</a></h2><p>recent research has shown that each apnea episode results in a significant rise of the beat-to-beat blood pressure followed by a drop to the pre-episode levels when patient resumes normal breathing. While the physiological implications of these repetitive and significant oscillations are still unknown, it is of interest to quantify them. Since current array of instruments deployed for polysomnography studies does not include beat-to-beat measurement of blood pressure, but includes oximetry which can supply pulsatile photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, in addition to percent  saturation. Hence, we have investigated a new method for continuous estimation of systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean (MBP) blood pressure waveforms from PPG. Peaks and troughs of PPG waveform are used as input to a 5th order autoregressive moving average model to construct estimates of SBP, DBP, and MBP waveforms. Since breath hold maneuvers are shown to faithfully simulate apnea episodes, we evaluated the performance of the proposed method in 7 subjects (4 F; $32 \pm 4$ yrs., BMI $24.57 \pm 3.87$ kg/) in supine position doing 5 breath holding maneuvers with 90s of normal breathing between them.

Previously, we showed that Salmeterol, a long-acting β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) agonist, has neuroprotective effects in PD models in vitro and in vivo through the β-arrestin2-dependent inhibition of pro-inflammatory M1-type mediator production. In the present study, we explored whether Salmeterol can mediate phenotypic conversion in LPS-activated murine microglial BV2 cells from the neurotoxic M1-like to a neuroprotective -like phenotype. Salmeterol inhibited the production of LPS-induced mediators of the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-(interleukin) 18, IL-6, chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4) and reactive  species from BV2 cells. Conversely, treatment with Salmeterol and other β2-AR agonists robustly enhances the production of the  cytokine IL-10 from LPS-activated microglia. In addition, Salmeterol upregulates the expression of arginase-1 and CXCL14. Furthermore, using siRNA approach we found that silencing of the transcription factor Creb abrogates the Salmeterol-mediated production of IL-10 in LPS-activated BV2 cells, but silencing of β-arrestin2 with Arrb2 siRNA did not. In addition, our data shows conversion from an M1- to -like phenotype in LPS-activated microglia by β2-AR agonists involves activation of the classical cAMP/PKA/CREB as well as the PI3K and p38 MAPK signaling pathways, and provides a novel therapeutic approach targeting microglial cell activation and inducing their phenotypic conversion in the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases such as PD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Participants ingested 0.35 g/kg of BD or placebo 30 min before and 60 min during 85 min of steady-state exercise, which preceded a ∼25- to 35-min TT (i.e., 7 kJ/kg). The ingestion of BD increased blood D-βHB concentration throughout exercise (0.44-0.79 mmol/L) compared with placebo (0.11-0.16 mmol/L; all p < .001), which peaked 1 hr following the TT (1.38 ± 0.35 vs. 0.34 ± 0.24 mmol/L; p < .001). Serum glucose and blood lactate concentrations were not different between trials (all p > .05). BD ingestion increased  consumption and carbon dioxide production after 20 min of steady-state exercise (p = .002 and p = .032, respectively); however, no further effects on cardiorespiratory parameters were observed. Within the BD trial, moderate to severe gastrointestinal symptoms were reported in five participants, and low levels of dizziness, nausea, and euphoria were reported in two participants. However, this had no effect on TT duration (placebo, 28.5 ± 3.6 min; BD, 28.7 ± 3.2 min; p = .62) and average power output (placebo, 290.1 ± 53.7 W; BD, 286.4 ± 45.9 W; p = .50). These results suggest that BD has no benefit for endurance performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30830763>Synergistic  Generation and Reactive  Species Scavenging by Manganese Ferrite/Ceria Co-decorated Nanoparticles for Rheumatoid Arthritis Treatment.</a></h2><p>Poor O supply to the infiltrated immune cells in the joint synovium of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) up-regulates hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) expression and induces reactive  species (ROS) generation, both of which exacerbate synovial inflammation. Synovial inflammation in RA can be resolved by eliminating pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and inducing anti-inflammatory  macrophages. Because hypoxia and ROS in the RA synovium play a crucial role in the induction of M1 macrophages and reduction of  macrophages, herein, we develop manganese ferrite and ceria nanoparticle-anchored mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MFC-MSNs) that can synergistically scavenge ROS and produce O for reducing M1 macrophage levels and inducing  macrophages for RA treatment. MFC-MSNs exhibit a synergistic effect on O generation and ROS scavenging that is attributed to the complementary reaction of ceria nanoparticles (NPs) that can scavenge intermediate hydroxyl radicals generated by manganese ferrite NPs in the process of O generation during the Fenton reaction, leading to the efficient polarization of M1 to  macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. Intra-articular administration of MFC-MSNs to rat RA models alleviated hypoxia, inflammation, and pathological features in the joint. Furthermore, MSNs were used as a drug-delivery vehicle, releasing the anti-rheumatic drug methotrexate in a sustained manner to augment the therapeutic effect of MFC-MSNs. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of MFC-MSNs that simultaneously generate O and scavenge ROS, subsequently driving inflammatory macrophages to the anti-inflammatory subtype for RA treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30667024>An N-doped porous carbon network with a multidirectional structure as a highly efficient metal-free catalyst for the  reduction reaction.</a></h2><p>Metal-free catalysts have gained substantial attention as a promising candidate to replace the expensive platinum (Pt) catalysts for the  reduction reaction (ORR) which is a key process in low temperature fuel cells. Development of highly efficient and mass-producible N-doped carbon catalysts, however, remains to be a great challenge. In this study, N-doped porous carbon (NPC) materials were synthesized via a simple, cost-effective and scalable method for mass production by using the d-gluconic acid sodium salt, pyrrole, Triton X-100 and KOH. The resulting NPC possessed a multidirectional porous carbon network (SBET: 1026.6  g-1, Vt: 1.046 cm3 g-1) with hierarchical porosity and plenty of graphitic N species (49.1%). Electrochemical tests showed that the NPC itself was highly active for the ORR under alkaline and acidic conditions via a four electron pathway for the complete reduction of O2 in water. More importantly, this NPC catalyst demonstrated better performance than commercial Pt/C catalysts in terms of long-term durability and methanol tolerance under both conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987293>Large Scale Synthesis of Nanopyramidal-Like VO₂ Films by an -Assisted Etching Growth Method with Significantly Enhanced Field Emission Properties.</a></h2><p>The present investigation reported on a novel -assisted etching growth method that can directly transform wafer-scale plain VO₂ thin films into pyramidal-like VO₂ nanostructures with highly improved field-emission properties. The  applied during annealing played a key role in the formation of the special pyramidal-like structures by introducing thin -rich transition layers on the top surfaces of the VO₂ crystals. An etching related growth and transformation mechanism for the synthesis of nanopyramidal films was proposed. Structural characterizations confirmed the formation of a composite VO₂ structure of monoclinic M1 (P21/c) and Mott insulating  (C2/m) phases for the films at room temperature. Moreover, by varying the  concentration, the nanocrystal morphology of the VO₂ films could be tuned, ranging over pyramidal, dot, and/or twin structures. These nanopyramidal VO₂ films showed potential benefits for application such as temperature-regulated field emission devices. For one typical sample deposited on a 3-inch silicon substrate, its emission current (measured at 6 V/μm) increased by about 1000 times after the -etching treatment, and the field enhancement factor β reached as high as 3810 and 1620 for the M and R states, respectively. The simple method reported in the present study may provide a protocol for building a variety of large interesting surfaces for VO₂-based device applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30361852>Neuronal EphA4 Regulates OGD/R-Induced Apoptosis by Promoting Alternative Activation of Microglia.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence indicates that post-injury inflammation characterized by activated microglia contributes much to the neuropathology of ischemic injury. Several studies have demonstrated that microglia exhibit two entirely different functional activation states, referred to as classically activated (M1) and alternatively activated () phenotype. Promoting microglial phenotype to switch from M1 dominant to  dominant might be a promising approach for handling ischemic injury. However, the comprehensive mechanism that underlines microglia polarization in ischemic brain remains unclear. Neuronal erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular carcinoma cell receptor 4 (EphA4), the richest Eph receptor in the central nervous system (CNS), upregulate after ischemia and may have the potential to regulate microglia activation. We hypothesized that modulating EphA4/ephrin signaling could affect ischemic injury through controlling microglia polarization. We therefore knocked down neuronal EphA4 with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and determined the role of EphA4/ephrin signaling in -glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced injury. We found that EphA4 shRNA treatment attenuated OGD/R-induced apoptosis and microglia proliferation. Neuronal EphA4 knockdown also promoted microglial  polarization, which reduced pro-inflammatory mediators and released anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as neurotrophic factors. We further revealed that EphA4 shRNA treatment functioned through RhoA/Rho-associated kinase 2 (ROCK2) signaling, a key mediator of microglia alternative activation. Together, these data suggested that blockage of EphA4/ephrin signaling between neuron and microglia decreased OGD/R-induced injury by promoting alternative activation of microglia via RhoA/ROCK2 signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31178738>Breaking Glucose Transporter 1/Pyruvate Kinase  Glycolytic Loop Is Required for Cantharidin Inhibition of Metastasis in Highly Metastatic Breast Cancer.</a></h2><p>Aerobic glycolysis plays a decisive role in cancer growth. However, its role in cancer metastasis was rarely understood. Cantharidin a natural compound from an arthropod insect cantharis exerts potent anticancer activity. Here we found cantharidin possesses significant anti-metastatic activity on breast cancer dependent on inhibition of aerobic glycolysis. Cantharidin indicates significant inhibition on migration and invasion of breast cancer cells, angiogenesis , and inhibits breast cancer cells metastasizing to liver and lung . Subsequent results revealed that cantharidin decreases the extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) but increases the  consumption rates (OCR) in high metastatic cells, leading to suppression of aerobic glycolysis. This was considered to be due to inhibiting the activity of pyruvate kinase (PK) and further blocking pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) translocation in nucleus. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and L-cysteine can significantly reverse cantharidin inhibition on breast cancer cell migration, invasion, and PKM2 translocation. Furthermore, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) forming a metabolic loop with PKM2 is downregulated, as well as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the regulator of the glycolytic loop. Totally, cantharidin inhibits the PKM2 nuclear translocation and breaks GLUT1/PKM2 glycolytic loop, resulting in aerobic glycolysis transformation to oxidation and subsequent reversing the metastases in breast cancer. Based on inhibiting multi signals mediated aerobic glycolysis, cantharidin could be prospectively used for prevention of metastasis in breast cancer patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30872795>Hypoxia-induced tumor exosomes promote -like macrophage polarization of infiltrating myeloid cells and microRNA-mediated metabolic shift.</a></h2><p>Developing tumors rapidly outgrow their  supply and are subject to hypoxia, which stimulates hypersecretion of tumor-derived exosomes that promote angiogenesis, metastasis, and immunosuppression, but the molecular mediators of these pathological effects remain poorly defined. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified that exosomes produced by hypoxic tumor cells are highly enriched in immunomodulatory proteins and chemokines including CSF-1, CCL2, FTH, FTL, and TGFβ. Modeling exosome effects on tumor-infiltrating immune cells, we observed a potent ability of these hypoxia-induced vesicles to influence macrophage recruitment and promote -like polarization both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, hypoxic, but not normoxic, tumor exosomes enhanced oxidative phosphorylation in bone marrow-derived macrophages via transfer of let-7a miRNA, resulting in suppression of the insulin-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Together, these data demonstrate that hypoxia promotes tumor secretion of biomolecule-loaded exosomes that can modify the immunometabolic profile of infiltrating monocyte-macrophages to better evade host immunity and enhance tumor progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31321420>Exploration of pathomechanism using comprehensive analysis of serum cytokines in polymyositis/dermatomyositis-interstitial lung disease.</a></h2><p>To elucidate the serum cytokine profile and address the pathomechanism of interstitial lung disease (ILD) complicated with PM/DM.Forty patients with PM/DM-ILD were enrolled, and principal components analysis and cluster analysis were performed to classify patients into subgroups. Additionally, we compared cytokine profiles between the survivors and dead patients and between anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 antibody- and anti-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase antibody-positive ILD patients. We also examined the association of various cytokines with disease activity indicators and prognosis of ILD.The principal components analysis data allowed classification of the cytokine profile into three groups: group 1, neutrophilic and M1-macrophage-driven cytokines; group 2, type 1 Th cell-driven and -macrophage-induced cytokines; and group 3, -macrophage-driven cytokines. Cluster analysis showed the presence of PM/DM-ILD patient groups with high or low levels of total cytokines. Ninety percent of patients who died of ILD were included in clusters with high cytokine levels. Serum cytokine levels of all groups were significantly higher in the anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 antibody-positive patients than in the anti-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase antibody-positive patients. Groups 1 and 2 significantly correlated with known factors for poor prognosis, such as serum ferritin levels and alveolar-arterial  difference. Serum cytokine levels of patients in group 1 were significantly higher initially and at 2 and 4 weeks in those who died.These findings suggested that the activation of monocytes, macrophages and type 1 Th cells, and neutrophils play roles in the pathomechanism of PM/DM-ILD, and group 1 cytokines could be useful biomarkers for predicting prognosis of PM/DM-ILD.© The Author(s) 2019.

We determined the concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteotropic hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL), testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) in the serum by electrochemiluminescence and measured the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), reactive  species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the seminal plasma by ELISA, compared the above indexes among the three groups, and analyzed their correlation with the semen volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count, and percentage of progressively motile sperm (PMS).The semen volume was significantly lower in the obesity than in the normal group (［2.63 ± 0.74］ vs ［3.37 ± 1.00］ ml, P < 0.05), and so was the percentage of PMS in the overweight and even lower in the obesity than in the normal group (［47.91 ± 12.89］ and ［41.27 ± 15.77］ vs ［54.04 ± 13.29］%, P < 0.05). Compared with the normal group, both the overweight and obesity groups showed markedly decreased levels of serum T (［4.83 ± 1.42］ vs ［3.71 ± 1.22］ and ［3.49 ± 1.12］ ng/ml, P<0.05), T/LH ratio (1.53 ± 0.57 vs 1.19 ± 0.54 and 0.97 ± 0.51, P<0.05), SOD (［112.05 ± 10.54］ vs ［105.85 ± 6.93］ and ［99.33 ± 8.39］ U/ml, P<0.05), and GSTs (［31.75±6.03］ vs ［29.54±5.78］ and ［29.02±4.52］ U/L, P<0.05), but remarkably increased seminal plasma ROS (［549.93±82.41］ vs ［620.61±96.13］ and ［701.47±110.60］ IU/ml, P<0.05) and MDA (［7.46 ± 2.13］ vs ［8.72 ± 1.89］ and ［10.47 ± 2.10］ nmol/L, P<0.05). BMI was correlated positively with ROS and MDA, but negatively with the semen volume, PMS, T, T/LH, SOD and GSTs (P<0.05); LH negatively with sperm concentration, total sperm count and GSTs (P<0.05); PRL negatively GSTs (P<0.05); E2 positively with SOD (P<0.05); T positively with SOD (P<0.05) but negatively with MDA (P<0.05); T/LH positively with PMS and SOD (P<0.05) but negatively with ROS and MDA (P<0.05); SOD positively with semen volume, PMS and GSTs (P<0.05) but negatively with ROS and MDA (P<0.05); GSTs negatively with sperm concentration; total sperm count and MDA (P<0.05); ROS positively with MDA (P<0.01) but negatively with PMS (P<0.05); and MDA negatively with semen volume (P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the independent factors influencing the semen volume were BMI and GSTs, those influencing the total sperm count were BMI and T, and those influencing PMS were BMI and MDA.Increased BMI induces changes in the levels of male reproductive hormones and seminal plasma oxidative stress and affects semen quality, which may be associated with male infertility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839193>Neuroprotective Effects of BHDPC, a Novel Neuroprotectant, on Experimental Stroke by Modulating Microglia Polarization.</a></h2><p>This study mainly investigated the therapeutic effects of BHDPC on ischemic stroke and its underlying mechanisms. In vivo, the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used to induce ischemic model. In vitro,  and glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced ischemic stroke in BV-2 microglia and primary neurons, and bEnd.3 mouse cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) were also used. First, we found that BHDPC exerts considerable neuroprotection against MCAO-induced ischemic injury to mice via alleviating neurological deficits and brain infarcts, inhibiting neuronal cell loss and apoptosis, and attenuating blood-brain barrier disruption and tight junction protein changes. Next, we observed that BHDPC significantly reduced microglial M1 activation but enhanced  polarization in MCAO-induced ischemic brain. Further experiments in vitro indicated that BHDPC suppressed microglial activation but promoted  microglial polarization in OGD/R-induced BV-2 microglia. In addition, conditioned medium (CM) experiments showed that CM from BHDPC-treated BV-2 microglia provided protections against OGD/R-induced ischemic damage in primary neurons and bEnd.3 ECs. Moreover, we found that BHDPC actions on microglial inflammation were associated with the inactivation of NF-κB signaling. Interestingly, we also found that BHDPC enhanced phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA) and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). The pharmacological inhibition or gene knockdown of PKA/CREB signaling diminished BHDPC-promoted microglial  polarization. In summary, BHDPC conferred neuroprotection against ischemic injury in experimental stroke models. Modulating microglial activation and polarization contributes to BHDPC-mediated neuroprotective actions, which in part were mediated by nuclear factor kappa B and PKA/CREB signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31509928>Low concentrations of FA exhibits the Hormesis effect by affecting cell division and the Warburg effect.</a></h2><p>Formaldehyde (FA), a ubiquitous indoor environmental pollutant, has been classified as a carcinogen. There are many studies showed that low levels of FA could promote cell proliferation, however, little is known about the signal pathways. To determine the potential molecular mechanisms, human chronic myeloid leukemia cells (K562 cells) and human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE cells) were exposed to different concentrations of FA. The data showed that FA at 0-125 μM or 0-60 μM promoted the proliferation of K562 cells or 16HBE cells respectively, indicating that FA did have the Hormesis effect. FA at 75 μM (K562 cells) and 40 μM (16HBE cells) significantly promoted cell proliferation, increased intracellular reactive  species (ROS) levels, and decreased glutathione (GSH) content. At the same time, FA treatment induced a marked increase in the key molecules of cell division like CyclinD-cdk4 and E2F1. In addition, pyruvate kinase isozyme  (PKM2), glucose, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), lactic acid and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) content in the Warburg effect were increased. Administering Vitamin E (VE), significantly disrupted cell division and disturbed the Warburg effect, effectively indicating the decrease of cell activity. Conclusively, these findings suggested that low concentrations of FA could promote cell proliferation by accelerating cell division process or enhancing the Warburg effect to embody the Hormesis effect.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between IVT and Maximal Fat Oxidation (MFO) in women with obesity.Fifty-two obese female adults (age = 43.6±10.9 years; BMI = 38.5±5.2 kg/) were included in this study. According to the BMI classification, subjects were divided into three groups: Obese Class I (OBI, n = 16); Obese Class II (OBII, n = 20) and Obese Class III (OBIII, n = 16). All subjects performed an incremental graded exercise test to evaluate peak  uptake (VO2peak), IVT and MFO. MFO was evaluated using a stoichiometric equation. Fat max zone was determined for each subject within 10% of fat oxidation rates at MFO. For each HR, %HRmax, VO2 and %VO2peak variable, Pearson's correlation test was done between IVT and MFO exercise intensity. When statistical correlation was found we used a comparative statistical analysis to assess differences between IVT and MFO. Statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0.05.For each HR, %HRmax, VO2 and %VO2peak variable there was a positive significant correlation (P<0.01) between IVT and MFO. No significant differences were found for HR, %HRmax, and VO2 between IVT and MFO. %VO2peak was significantly higher at IVT than at MFO (P = 0.03). MFO rates were significantly higher in OBIII women than in women of the other two classes. In all subjects, IVT was within the fat max zone.The use of HR and VO2 corresponding to IVT could be a useful parameter not only to improve cardiorespiratory fitness but also to prescribe physical activity that maximize fat oxidation in obese subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29771283>Adolescents at high risk of obesity show greater striatal response to increased sugar content in milkshakes.</a></h2><p>Children of overweight or obese parents are at a high risk of developing obesity.This study sought to examine the underlying neural factors related to parental obesity risk and the relative impact of sugar and fat when consuming a palatable food, as well as the impact of obesity risk status on brain response to appetizing food images.With the use of functional MRI, the responses of 108 healthy-weight adolescents [mean ± SD body mass index (kg/): 20.9 ± 1.9; n = 53 who were at high risk by virtue of parental obesity status, n = 55 who were low risk] to food stimuli were examined. Stimuli included 4 milkshakes, which systematically varied in sugar and fat content, a calorie-free tasteless solution, and images of appetizing foods and glasses of water.High-risk compared with low-risk adolescents showed greater blood -dependent response to milkshakes (all variants collapsed) compared with the tasteless solution in the primary gustatory and oral somatosensory cortices (P-family-wise error rate < 0.05), replicating a previous report. Notably, high-risk adolescents showed greater caudate, gustatory, and oral somatosensory responses to the high-sugar milkshake than to the tasteless solution; however, no effect of risk status was observed in the high-fat milkshake condition. Responses to food images were not related to obesity risk status.Collectively, the data presented here suggest that parental weight status is associated with greater striatal, gustatory, and somatosensory responses to palatable foods-in particular, high-sugar foods-in their adolescent offspring, which theoretically contributes to an increased risk of future overeating.

To date, how influenza A  protein modulates the host innate immunity remains unclear. Herein, we showed that  protein colocalized and interacted with MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein) on mitochondria, and positively regulated MAVS-mediated innate immunity. Further studies revealed that  induced reactive  species (ROS) production that was required for activation of macroautophagy/autophagy and enhancement of MAVS signaling pathway. Importantly, the proton channel activity of  protein was demonstrated to be essential for ROS production and antagonizing the autophagy pathway to control MAVS aggregation, thereby enhancing MAVS signal activity.

The mean age at operation was 5.3 years (range 0-22 years). Follow-up was carried out in 20 of 22 patients (91%) and the mean follow-up period was 14.7 years (range 0-39 years).Actuarial survival and reoperation-free survival rates at 30 years were 49% and 21%, respectively. To date, 8 patients have been followed up. Among them, atrioventricular valve replacement and permanent pacemaker were required in 4 and 7 patients, respectively. Late cardiac catheter examination at 25.5 years after surgery showed that the median cardiac index was 2.6 l/min/ (range 2.1-3.4 l/min/), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 7 mmHg (range 4-11 mmHg), left ventricular ejection fraction was 50% (range 27-63%), right ventricular ejection fraction was 53% (range 31-66%) and central venous pressure was 6 mmHg (range 4-11 mmHg). At the latest follow-up, the New York Heart Association Functional Classification was I for 5 patients, II for 2 patients and III for 1 patient. The median peak  uptake was 52.9% (range 44.1-93.5%).Some patients with double-inlet left ventricle were able to maintain low central venous pressure and a sufficient cardiac index long after ventricular septation. Although the single ventricle strategy remains a first-line treatment, ventricular septation can be a surgical treatment option.© The Author(s) 2019.

Military physical training not only provides the performance capabilities required for performing occupational tasks but also fosters the development of sport. Thus, Armed Forces across the world have historically invested in developing elite- and Olympic-level athletes. This study aimed to assess the anthropometric and physiological differences among groups of Brazilian military athletes (MA), non-military athletes (A), and military non-athletes (M).Seventy-five individuals participated in the study: 17 MA (23.7 ± 4.8 years), 27 A (24.7 ± 5.3 years), and 31 M (26.9 ± 3.3 years). MA and A individuals specialized in endurance sports, and had a mean weekly training volume of (100.0 ± 34.8 and 106.3 ± 40.5 Km; F = 0.894, p = 0.6), respectively. Anthropometric measures and maximal  uptake (V̇O2máx) were assessed in all participants. Ergospirometry and anthropometry variables were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for independent measures. Comparisons of weekly training volume (km) and training experience (years) were performed only between the A and MA using the Student's t-test for independent samples. For a multidimensional approach, Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was performed for all variables using the online tool MetaboAnalyst.We found no differences in anthropometric and physiological profiles between A and MA, but significant differences between M and MA/A in body mass index (kg/) (BMI), body fat percentage, fat mass (kg), waist circumference (cm) (WC), somatotype, and V̇O2máx (mL min-1 kg-1).In conclusion, military endurance athletes have similar anthropometric and physiological profiles to non-military athletes and superior levels to non-athlete military. These findings indicate that the Brazilian Armed Forces scouting system has been successful in identifying endurance athletic talent in line with their historic role of developing sport in Brazil.© Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2019.

Human and animal studies have demonstrated that neonatal hyperoxia increases oxidative stress and induces damage and collagen deposition in kidney during the perinatal period. Cathelicidin LL-37 is one important group of human antimicrobial peptides which exhibits antioxidant activity and its overexpression resists hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress. This study was designed to evaluate the protective effects of cathelicidin in hyperoxia-induced kidney injury in newborn rats.  Sprague-Dawley rat pups were reared in either room air (RA) or hyperoxia (85% O) and were randomly treated with low-dose (4 mg/kg) and high-dose (8 mg/kg) cathelicidin in normal saline (NS) administered intraperitoneally on postnatal days 1-6. The following six groups were obtained: RA + NS, RA + low-dose cathelicidin, RA + high-dose cathelicidin, O + NS, O + low-dose cathelicidin, and O + high-dose cathelicidin. Kidneys were taken for Western blot and histological analyses on postnatal day 7.  The hyperoxia-reared rats exhibited significantly lower body weights and anti-inflammatory  macrophages, but the kidney injury scores, oxidative stress marker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)-positive cells, pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, collagen deposition, and NF-κB expression were higher than did the RA-reared rats.  Cathelicidin treatment attenuated kidney injury as evidenced by lower kidney injury scores, 8-OHdG-positive cells, collagen deposition, and reversion of hyperoxia-induced M1/ macrophage polarization. The role of Cathelicidin in ameliorates kidney injury of the hyperoxia newborn rats was accompanied by decreased NF-κB expression, which probably through the modulating NF-κB activity in the kidney.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29791605>Athlete's heart in a Brazilian paralympic judo team. Case series study.</a></h2><p>Athlete's heart is a term describing the cardiovascular effects of long-term conditioning among highly trained athletes. It is a variation of normal standards.Case series study at the cardiology division of a public university hospital.We studied 14 visually handicapped paralympic athletes (8 men) in the national judo team. They were 26.3 ± 6.4 years old, with body mass index 25 ± 14, and had been practicing judo for 9.2 ± 7.9 years. Clinical evaluations, electrocardiograms, exercise testing and echocardiograms were performed by independent observers.Signs of athlete's heart were found in all athletes, comprising left ventricular hypertrophy (5 cases), sinus bradycardia (5), T-wave juvenile pattern (3), T wave juvenile pattern (3), left atrial hypertrophy (2) and increased left ventricular volume (9 cases; 62.22 ± 6.46 ml/). There were very strong correlations between left ventricular mass/body surface and endurance time (r: 0.91) and estimated peak  uptake (r: 0.8). The correlations between left ventricular internal diastolic dimension and endurance time (r: 0.91) and estimated peak  uptake (r: 0.8) were strong. Despite increased left ventricular dimensions (4 cases), atrial dimensions (1) and relative wall thickness (4), all athletes had normal left ventricular mass/body surface (89.98 ± 21.93 g/m²). The exercise testing was normal: exercise duration 706 ± 45 seconds and estimated peak  uptake 62.70 ± 9.99 mlO2/min.Signs of athlete's heart were seen frequently in the paralympic judo team. These demonstrated the presence of mild cardiac adaptations to training.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30326267>Hormesis mediates dose-sensitive shifts in macrophage activation patterns.</a></h2><p>The activation or polarization of macrophages to pro- or anti-inflammatory states evolved as an adaptation to protect against a spectrum of biological threats. Such an adaptation engages pro-oxidative mechanisms and enables macrophages to neutralize and kill threatening organisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria, mold), limit cancerous growths, and enhance recovery and repair processes. The present study demonstrates that (1) many diverse pharmacological, chemical and physical agents can mediate a dose/concentration-dependent shift between pro- and anti-inflammatory activation states, and (2) these shifts in activation states display biphasic dose-response relationships that are characteristic of hormesis. This study also reveals that preconditioning-another form of hormesis-similarly mediates tissue protection by the polarization of macrophages, but in this case, towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype. This assessment supports the generalizability and significance of hormesis in biology, medicine, and public health and further extends it to encompass the hormetic activation of macrophages.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Unlike normal cells, tumor cells favor glycolysis even in the presence of sufficient . Pyruvate kinase (PK), a key glucose metabolic enzyme, converts phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate by transferring the high-energy phosphate group to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), one of the four isozyme of PK, which universally expressed in rapidly proliferating cells such as embryonic cells and cancer cells. Recent years, more and more research suggested PKM2 plays a crucial role in cancer progression through both metabolic and non-metabolic pathways. On the one hand, the middle product of glycolysis, such as amino acids, nucleotides, lipids is necessary to rapid growth of cancer cells. On the other hand, PKM2 supports tumor growth through regulating the expression of gene that involved in cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. In this article, we review the recent advances to further understand the regulation and function of PKM2 in tumorigenesis. Given its multiple effects on cancer, PKM2 may be a potential target for cancer diagnosis and treatment.Copyright © 2018.

Conventionally, macrophages have been classified as M1 and  depending on their phenotype and role in immune regulation. M1 macrophages are generally pro-inflammatory, while  (also known as alternatively activated macrophages) are anti-inflammatory. M1 macrophages release pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive nitrogen, and  intermediates, and kill pathogens, whereas their  counterparts participate in the resolution of inflammation, remodeling of tissue, angiogenesis, and tissue repair. Macrophages are also crucial in the pathogenesis of immune-inflammatory disorders, such as, arthritis.

In this present study, we investigated the role of HBOP in ICH-induced microglia polarization and the potential involved signal pathway.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: SHAM, ICH, and ICH + HBOP group. Before surgery, rats in SHAM and HBOP groups received HBO for 5 days. Rats in SHAM group received needle injection, while rats in ICH and ICH + HBOP groups received 100 μL autologous blood injection into the right basal ganglia. Rats were euthanized at 24 hours after ICH, and the brains were removed for immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Neurological deficits and brain water content were determined.Intracerebral hemorrhage induced brain edema, which was significantly lower in the HBOP group. The levels of MMP9 were also less in the HBOP group. HBO pretreatment resulted in less neuronal death and neurological deficits after ICH. Their immunoactivity and protein levels of M1 markers were downregulated, but the  markers were unchanged by HBOP. In addition, ICH-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α and IL-1β) levels and the phosphorylation of JNK and STAT1 were also lower in the HBOP rats.HBO pretreatment attenuated ICH-induced brain injuries and MMP9 upregulation, which may through the inhibiting of M1 polarization of microglia and inflammatory signal pathways after ICH.© 2019 Zhejiang Hospital.

Recent studies have implicated SAAs in innate immunity and various disorders, however the precise mechanism eludes us. Previous studies have shown SAAs are elevated following stroke and cerebral ischemiand our studies demonstrated that SAA deficient mice reduces inflammation and infarct volumes in a mouse stroke model. Our studies demonstrate SAA increases the cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is mediated by Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, cathepsin B and caspase-1 and may play a role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. SAA induced the expression of NLRP3 which mediated IL-1β induction in murine BV-2 cells and both sex primary mouse microglial cells, in a dose and time dependent fashion. Inhibition or knockout of the NLRP3 in microglia prevented the increase in IL-1β. -acetyl--cysteine and mito-TEMPO blocked the induction of IL-1β by inhibiting reactive  species (ROS) with SAA treatment. In addition, inhibition of cathepsin B with different drugs or microglia from CatB deficient mice attenuated inflammasome activation. Our studies suggest that the impact of SAA on inflammasome stimulation is mediated in part by the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) and Toll-like receptor proteins 2 and 4. SAA induced inflammatory cytokines and an M1 phenotype in the microglial cells, while downregulating anti-inflammation  phenotype. These studies suggest that brain injury to can elicit a systemic inflammatory response mediated through SAA that contributes to the pathological outcomes.In the present study, SAA can induce that activation of the inflammasome in microglial cells and give rise to IL-1β release which can further inflammation in the brain following neurological diseases.

Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) is an anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory protein with atheroprotective effects. However, in vivo cleavage of Trx-1 generates a truncated pro-inflammatory protein, Trx-80, which compromises the therapeutic use of Trx-1. Here we analysed whether the thioredoxin-mimetic peptide (TxMP), CB3 might exert anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and atheroprotective effects in ApoE2.Ki mice.We synthesized a small TxMP, Ac-Cys-Pro-Cys-amide, CB3 and characterized its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on cultured peritoneal murine macrophages. CB3 significantly and dose-dependently reduced the level of reactive  species in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-activated macrophages. In addition, it efficiently lowered LPS-induced inflammatory process through NF-κB inhibition, as evidenced by the reduced secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α by macrophages. Nevertheless, CB3 did not affect cholesterol accumulation in macrophages. A daily-administered dose of 10 µg/g body weight CB3 to ApoE2.Ki mice on high fat diet did not affect plasma of total cholesterol and triglycerides levels but significantly reduced the plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-33 and TNF-α) and oxidative markers. In contrast, it significantly induced the plasma levels of anti-inflammatory proteins (adiponectin, IL-10). In addition, CB3 reduced the number of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages in spleen and decreased the ratio of M1/ macrophages in atherosclerotic lesion areas. Finally, CB3 significantly reduced the surface area of aortic lesions.Our results clearly showed that similar to the full length Trx-1, CB3 exerts protective effects, by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in macrophages and in ApoE2.Ki mice.

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is considered as one of the major causative agents of brain abscesses. Due to the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria the available treatment options including conventional antibiotics and steroid therapy become ineffective in terms of inflammation regulation which warrants further investigation to resolve this health issue. Microglial TLR-2 plays important roles in the bacterial recognition as well as induction of inflammation whereas glucocorticoid receptor (GR) triggers anti-inflammatory pathways in presence of glucocorticoids (GCs). The main objective of this study was to figure out the interdependency between TLR-2 and GR in presence of exogenous dexamethasone during microglial inflammation as an alternative therapeutic approach. Experiments were done either in TLR-2 neutralized condition or GR blocked condition in presence of dexamethasone. Free radicals production, arginase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase enzyme activities and corticosterone concentration were measured along with Western blot analysis of TLR-2, GR and other inflammatory molecules. The results suggested that dexamethasone pre-treatment in TLR-2 neutralized condition efficiently reduces the inflammatory consequences of S. aureus induced microglial inflammation through up regulating GR expression. During TLR-2 blocking dexamethasone exerted its potent anti-inflammatory activities via suppressing reactive  species (ROS), NO production and up regulating arginase, SOD and catalase activities at the time point of 90 min. Further in-vivo experiments are needed to conclude that dexamethasone could resolve brain inflammation possibly through microglial phenotypic switching from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This was a retrospective study of children who underwent awake flexible endoscopy, DISE, and adenoidectomy with/without tonsillectomy at the Shanghai Children's Medical Center between 03/2015 and 12/2016. Tonsillectomy was performed for tonsillar obstruction found by DISE. Adenoidectomy was performed for all children. Cardio-pulmonary coupling (CPC) and oximetry were observed before/after surgery. The study included 126 children: 56 (44.4%) with grade 2 tonsils and 70 (55.6%) with grade 1. Mean age was 5.7±3.2 (range, 2.8-10.4) years and mean BMI of 15.7±5.5 kg/. Unexpectedly, DISE showed tonsillar obstruction in 57 (45.2%) children, including 44 (78.6%) with grade 2 tonsils and 13 (18.6%) with grade 1. Therefore, DISE-directed tonsillectomy was performed for 57 patients.

We generated a mouse monoclonal antibody against rat DCAR1, and used this to characterize receptor expression and function. Rat DCAR1 was expressed on minor subsets of myeloid cells in lymphoid tissue, but was uniformly expressed at a high level by eosinophils, and at a low level by neutrophils. It was expressed by eosinophils in the peritoneal cavity and the lamina propria of the gut, and by subsets of macrophages or dendritic cells at these sites. Polarization of peritoneal macrophages showed that DCAR1 expression was absent on M1 macrophages, and increased on  macrophages. DCAR1 could be expressed as a homodimer and its associated with the activating adaptor protein FcεRIγ. This association allowed efficient phagocytosis of antibody-coated beads. Additionally, cross-linking of DCAR1 on the surface of rat eosinophils lead to production of reactive  species. These data show that DCAR1 is an activating receptor. Its expression on  macrophages and eosinophils suggests that it may play a role in the immune response to parasites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29854425>Flt3 Regulation in the Mononuclear Phagocyte System Promotes Ocular Neovascularization.</a></h2><p>Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3), a tyrosine kinase receptor expressed in CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, is important for both normal myeloid and lymphoid differentiation. It has been implicated in mice and humans for potential multilineage differentiation. We found that mice deficient in Flt3 or mice that received an Flt3 inhibitor (AC220) showed significantly reduced areas of ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization (RNV) and laser-induced choroidal NV (CNV) ( < 0.05). Increased Flt3 expression at the protein level was detected in retinas of -induced retinopathy (OIR) mice at P15 and P18 during retinal NV (RNV) progression. We subsequently found that macrophages (Mphi) polarization was regulated at the site of CNV in Flt3-deficient mice. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that Flt3 deficiency shifted Mphi polarization towards an  phenotype during RNV with significant reduction in M1 cytokine expression when compared to the wild-type controls ( < 0.05). Based on the above findings, we concluded that Flt3 inhibition alleviated ocular NV by promoting a Mphi polarization shift towards the  phenotype.

However, the association between diastolic dysfunction and right ventricular (RV) loading conditions and function has not been investigated in asymptomatic AS patients.A total of 41 patients underwent right heart catheterization and simultaneous echocardiography at rest and during maximal supine exercise, stratified according to resting diastolic function. Cardiac chamber size and morphology was assessed using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI). RV stroke work index, pulmonary artery (PA) compliance, PA elastance, PA pulsatility index, and right atrial pressure (RAP) were calculated at rest and maximal exercise. Ten patients (24%) had normal LV filling pattern, 20 patients (49%) had grade 1, and 11 patients (27%) had grade 2 diastolic dysfunction. Compared to patients with normal diastolic filling pattern, patients with diastolic dysfunction had lower RV end-diastolic volume (66 ± 11 ml/ vs. 79 ± 15 ml/, p = 0.02) and end-systolic volume (25 ± 7 ml/ vs. 32 ± 9 ml/, p = 0.04). An increase in mean RAP to ≥15 mmHg following exercise was not seen in patients with normal LV filling, compared to 4 patients (20%) with mild and 7 patients (63%) with moderate diastolic dysfunction (p = 0.003). PA pressure and PA elastance was increased in grade 2 diastolic dysfunction and correlated with RV volume and maximal  consumption (r = -0.71, p < 0.001).Moderate diastolic dysfunction is associated with increased RV afterload (elastance), which is compensated at rest, but is associated with increased RAP and inversely related to maximal  consumption during maximal exercise.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30957932>Microthrombus-Targeting Micelles for Neurovascular Remodeling and Enhanced Microcirculatory Perfusion in Acute Ischemic Stroke.</a></h2><p>Reperfusion injury exists as the major obstacle to full recovery of neuron functions after ischemic stroke onset and clinical thrombolytic therapies. Complex cellular cascades including oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and brain vascular impairment occur within neurovascular units, leading to microthrombus formation and ultimate neuron death. In this work, a multitarget micelle system is developed to simultaneously modulate various cell types involved in these events. Briefly, rapamycin is encapsulated in self-assembled micelles that are consisted of reactive  species (ROS)-responsive and fibrin-binding polymers to achieve micelle retention and controlled drug release within the ischemic lesion. Neuron survival is reinforced by the combination of micelle facilitated ROS elimination and antistress signaling pathway interference under ischemia conditions. In vivo results demonstrate an overall remodeling of neurovascular unit through micelle polarized  microglia repair and blood-brain barrier preservation, leading to enhanced neuroprotection and blood perfusion. This strategy gives a proof of concept that neurovascular units can serve as an integrated target for ischemic stroke treatment with nanomedicines.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Elevated microRNA-143 (miR-143) expression causes impaired glucose uptake that is responsible for the ischemic cerebral injury. However, the role and mechanism of HOTTIP in ischemic stroke are still unknown. The expression of HOTTIP and miR-143 was first detected in mouse models of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and in primary neurons exposed to -glucose deprivation (OGD). We used gain-of function and loss-of function approaches in vitro to investigate the effect and mechanism of HOTTIP on ischemic stroke by evaluating cell viability, apoptosis, and glycolytic metabolism of neurons exposed to OGD. The HOTTIP expression was decreased, whereas miR-143 increased in experimental ischemic stroke models. Overexpression of HOTTIP by the pcDNA3.1-HOTTIP plasmid significantly increased cell viability, glucose uptake, and the expression of hexokinase 2 (HK-2) and pyruvate kinase  that were reduced by OGD insult. The HOTTIP overexpression also diminished OGD induced the apoptosis and the caspase-3 activity of neurons. The miR-143 mimic reversed these effects, and anti-miR-143 enhanced them. In addition, we found that HOTTIP could function as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-143 to modulate HK-2 expression. In conclusion, the HOTTIP expression was reduced in ischemic stroke. The HOTTIP overexpression attenuated OGD-induced neuronal injury and imbalanced glycolytic metabolism by sponging miR-143, resulting in the de-repression of its endogenous target HK-2. Taken together, these findings improve understanding of the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30761102>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Viroporin 3a Activates the NLRP3 Inflammasome.</a></h2><p>Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) regulates the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and IL-18. We previously showed that influenza virus  or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 2B proteins stimulate IL-1β secretion following activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, the mechanism by which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) activates the NLRP3 inflammasome remains unknown. Here, we provide direct evidence that SARS-CoV 3a protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages. SARS-CoV 3a was sufficient to cause the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The ion channel activity of the 3a protein was essential for 3a-mediated IL-1β secretion. While cells uninfected or infected with a lentivirus expressing a 3a protein defective in ion channel activity expressed NLRP3 uniformly throughout the cytoplasm, NLRP3 was redistributed to the perinuclear space in cells infected with a lentivirus expressing the 3a protein.

Here, we compared in vivo abdominal (ABD) and femoral (FEM) subcutaneous AT pO2 in women who are overweight and have obesity, and investigated the effects of physiological AT pO2 on human adipocyte function.ABD and FEM subcutaneous AT pO2 and AT blood flow (ATBF) were assessed in eight [BMI (body mass index) 34.4 ± 1.6 kg/] postmenopausal women who were overweight with obesity and impaired glucose metabolism. ABD and FEM AT biopsy specimens were collected to determine adipocyte morphology and AT gene expression. Moreover, the effects of prolonged exposure (14 days) to physiological AT pO2 on adipokine expression/secretion, mitochondrial respiration, and glucose uptake were investigated in differentiated human multipotent adipose-derived stem cells.AT pO2 was higher in ABD than FEM AT (62.7 ± 6.6 vs 50.0 ± 4.5 mm Hg, P = 0.013), whereas ATBF was comparable between depots. Maximal uncoupled  consumption rates were substantially lower in ABD than FEM adipocytes for all pO2 conditions. Low physiological pO2 (5% O2) decreased proinflammatory gene expression, increased basal glucose uptake, and altered adipokine secretion in ABD and FEM adipocytes.We demonstrated for the first time, to our knowledge, that AT pO2 is higher in ABD than FEM subcutaneous AT in women who are overweight/with obesity, partly due to a lower  consumption rate in ABD adipocytes. Moreover, low physiological pO2 decreased proinflammatory gene expression and improved the metabolic phenotype in differentiated human adipocytes, whereas more heterogeneous effects on adipokine secretion were found.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430745>The Organ Handling of Soluble Klotho in Humans.</a></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) reduces both Klotho expression and its shedding into circulation, an effect that accelerates progression and cardiovascular complications. However, the mechanisms that regulate Klotho release by the human kidney are still unknown.We measured plasma Klotho across the kidney, splanchnic organs and lung in 22 patients (71 ± 2 years, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 60 ± 5.4 mL/min 1.73 ) during elective diagnostic cardiac catheterizations.Although the Klotho average renal vein concentrations were remarkably higher (by ∼9%) than arterial values, the kidney removed Klotho (or was at zero balance) in 7 subjects, indicating that the kidney contribution to systemic Klotho is not constant. Klotho fractional enrichment across the kidney was inversely related to plasma sodium (r = 0.43, p = 0.045) and acid uric acid levels (r = 0.38, p = 0.084) and directly, to renal  extraction (r = 0.56, p = 0.006). In multivariate analysis, renal  extraction was the only predictor of the enrichment of Klotho across the kidney, suggesting the dependence of renal Klotho release on tubular hypoxia or oxidative metabolism. Klotho balance was neutral across the lung. In patients with eGFR <60 mL/min, Klotho was also removed by splanchnic organs (single pass fractional extraction ∼11%).The present study identifies kidney  uptake as a predictor of Klotho release, and splanchnic organs as a site for Klotho removal. This study provides new understanding of kidney Klotho release and suggests that modulating kidney  metabolism could increase Klotho delivery, as an option to slow disease progression and blunt organ damage.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

The pathologic response to these toxicants depends on the dose and duration of exposure and their physical/chemical properties. A common response to pulmonary toxicant exposure is an accumulation of proinflammatory/cytotoxic M1 macrophages at sites of tissue injury, followed by the appearance of anti-inflammatory/wound repair  macrophages. It is thought that the outcome of the pathogenic responses to toxicants depends on the balance in the activity of these macrophage subpopulations. Overactivation of either M1 or  macrophages leads to injury and disease pathogenesis. Thus, the very same macrophage-derived mediators, released in controlled amounts to destroy injurious materials and pathogens (eg, reactive  species, reactive nitrogen species, proteases, tumor necrosis factor α) and initiate wound repair (eg, transforming growth factor β, connective tissue growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor), can exacerbate acute lung injury and/or induce chronic disease such as fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma, when released in excess. This review focuses on the role of macrophage subsets in acute lung injury and chronic fibrosis. Understanding how these pathologies develop following exposure to toxicants, and the contribution of resident and inflammatory macrophages to disease pathogenesis may lead to the development of novel approaches for treating lung diseases.© The Author(s) 2018.

Herein, we have developed an Fe-containing heteropolyacid by cation-exchange and employed KFePW12O40 nanostructures for Fenton, photo-Fenton and enzyme-mimetic reactions. The as-prepared KFePW12O40 catalyst exhibits efficient degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) via the photo-Fenton reaction. As an enzyme-mimetic, this material can effectively oxidize TMB and dopamine. The obtained nanomaterials were characterized via SEM, TEM, XPS, BET surface area, TGA, UV-Vis spectroscopy, FT-IR, and XRD techniques. The photocatalyst has a relatively large surface area of 38  g-1, and the Keggin structure of phosphotungstic ions is kept intact during the preparation. The RhB dye pollutants can be efficiently bleached and degraded up to about 80% within a one hour photo-Fenton reaction under visible light irradiation. Our results indicate that the KFePW12O40 nanomaterial can effectively mimic the enzyme cascade reaction of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). It also has a high affinity toward 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) for oxidation and henceforth, it has been used for the colorimetric assay of dopamine and H2O2. Overall, our study suggests that KFePW12O40 can be used for the efficient degradation of environmental pollutants.

Predicting marathon performance time throughout the training preparation in recreational runners. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The objective of this study was to predict marathon performance at different time points along the season using different speeds derived from ventilatory thresholds and running economy (RE). Sixteen recreational runners (8 women and 8 men) completed a 16-week marathon training macrocycle. Aerobic threshold (AeT), anaerobic threshold (AnT), and maximal  uptake were assessed at the beginning of the season, whereas speeds eliciting training zones at AeT and AnT, and RE were evaluated at 5-time points during the season (M1-M5). Analyses of variance and hierarchical regression analyses were conducted. Training improved AeT and AnT speeds at  vs. M1 (p = 0.001) and remained significantly higher at M3, M4, and M5 (p = 0.001). There was a significant effect of time (p = 0.003) for RE, being higher at M4 and M5 compared with M1 and M3. Significant correlations were found between marathon performance and speeds at AeT and AnT at every time point (r = 0.81-0.94; p < 0.05). Speed at AnT represented the main influence (65.9 and 71.41%) in the final time prediction at M1 and , whereas speed at AeT took its place toward the end of the macrocycle (76.0, 80.4, and 85.0% for M3, M4, and M5, respectively). In conclusion, assessment of speeds at AeT and AnT permits for reasonable performance prediction during the training preparation, therefore avoiding maximal testing while monitoring 2 fundamental training speeds. Future research should verify if these findings are applicable to runners of different levels and other periodization models.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30204197>High-quality and low-cost three-dimensional graphene from graphite flakes via carbocation-induced interlayer  release.</a></h2><p>Three-dimensional (3D) graphene can fully bring the excellent properties of graphene into wide utilization. However, its production requires the use of graphene oxide as the intermediate or harsh chemical vapour deposition conditions, which do not meet the requirements of high quality and low cost simultaneously. Herein, we report a room-temperature low-cost strategy to produce 3D graphene under ambient conditions, which is achieved via carbocation-induced interlayer  release. Graphite layers can transfer electrons to hydrogen peroxide, forming carbocations, which in turn oxidize hydrogen peroxide to release O2, substantially enlarging the interlayer space of graphite. We show that graphite can expand 1000 times or more into the liquid phase and no -containing groups are introduced on the basal plane. The obtained 3D graphene has an open porous structure and a specific surface area (SSA) of 1245  g-1, which is comparable to that of CVD-grown 3D graphene networks and equivalent to that of 2-layer graphene. Moreover, the quality of 3D graphene is high, with ID/IG smaller than 0.2. The as-obtained 3D graphene can be easily exfoliated into graphene sheets with 100% yield. Gifted with well-maintained crystalline quality and highly accessible surface area, the 3D graphene-based composite exhibits ultra-long life when used as lithium anode, with slight capacity degradation after 1000 cycles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867547>TiO decorated functionalized halloysite nanotubes (TiO@HNTs) and photocatalytic PVC membranes synthesis, characterization and its application in water treatment.</a></h2><p>In this study photocatalyst, TiO@HNTs were prepared by  synthesizing TiO nanoparticles in situ on the  functionalized halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) surface. Photocatalytic PVC membrane TiO@HNTs  (2 wt.%) and TiO@HNTs M3 (3 wt.%) were also prepared. Photocatalyst TiO@HNTs and photocatalytic PVC membranes were used to study the photocatalytic activity against the methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RB) dyes in UV batch reactor. The structure and morphology of photocatalyst and photocatalytic PVC membrane were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-Vis spectrophotometer and photoluminescence (PL). The PL study showed that the  vacancies and surface hydroxyl groups present on the surface of TiO@HNTs act as excellent traps for charge carrier, reducing the electron-hole recombination rate.TiO@HNTs 2 (2 wt.%) and TiO@HNTs 3 (3 wt.%) degraded MB dye up to 83.21%, 87.47% and RB dye up to 96.84% and 96.87%, respectively. TiO@HNT photocatalyst proved to be stable during the three consecutive cycle of photocatalytic degradation of the RB dye. TiO@HNTs  and TiO@HNTs M3 degraded MB dye up to 27.19%, 42.37% and RB dye up to 30.78%, 32.76%, respectively. Photocatalytic degradation of both the dyes followed the first-order kinetic model. Degradation product analysis was done using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and the results showed that the dye degradation was initiated by demethylation of the molecule. MB and RB dye degradation reaction were tested by TBA and IPA as OH and H scavengers respectively.

Hospital records were retrospectively reviewed. Information was collected on demographic characteristics, comorbidities, haemodynamic parameters, airway and anaesthetic management and complications.The study included 95 patients (mean age, 37.4±12.1 years; mean body mass index, 46 Kg/). Despite high airway assessment scores in some patients, 93 patients (98%) were conventionally intubated using our modified ramp position. Anaesthesia induction involved propofol, and anaesthesia maintenance involved inhalation anaesthetics (remifentanil supplementation). Additionally, rocuronium and sugammadex were used. Postoperative pain was managed with multimodal analgesia. Dose calculations were mostly based on lean/ideal body weight. Significant differences were found in the mean arterial pressure, heart rate and arterial  saturation before induction and 5 min after induction. Intraoperatively, 3 patients (3.2%) developed bronchospasm and 1 (1.1%) developed bradycardia. There were no postoperative complications.Inhalational anaesthesia with remifentanil and rocuronium-sugammadex is a safe option in bariatric surgery. Although conventional techniques are sufficient to establish the airway in most cases, preparations for difficult intubation should be made. Furthermore, careful patient selection, preoperative anaesthetic management planning and appropriate postoperative monitoring are necessary.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30508092>Metformin induces CD11b+-cell-mediated growth inhibition of an osteosarcoma: implications for metabolic reprogramming of myeloid cells and anti-tumor effects.</a></h2><p>CD11b+ myeloid subpopulations, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), play crucial roles in the suppression of T-cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Regulation of these cell types is a primary goal for achieving efficient cancer immunotherapy. We found that metformin (Met) induces CD11b+-cell-mediated growth inhibition of a K7M2neo osteosarcoma independent of T cells, as growth inhibition of K7M2neo was still observed in wild-type (WT) mice depleted of T cells by antibodies and in SCID; this contrasted with the effect of Met on Meth A fibrosarcoma, which was entirely T-cell-dependent. Moreover, the inhibitory effect seen in SCID was abrogated by anti-CD11b antibody injection. PMN-MDSCs were significantly reduced in both spleens and tumors following Met treatment. In TAMs, production of IL-12 and TNF-α, but not IL-10, became apparent, and elevation of MHC class II with reduction of CD206 was observed, indicating a shift from an - to M1-like phenotype via Met administration. Metabolically, Met treatment decreased basal respiration and the  consumption rate (OCR)/extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) ratio of CD11b+ cells in tumors, but not in the spleen. In addition, decreased reactive  species (ROS) production and proton leakage in MDSCs and TAMs were consistently observed in tumors. Uptake of both 2-deoxy-2-d-glucose (2-NBDG) and BODIPY® decreased in MDSCs, but only BODIPY® incorporation was decreased in TAMs. Overall, our results suggest that Met redirects the metabolism of CD11b+ cells to lower oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) while elevating glycolysis, thereby pushing the microenvironment to a state that inhibits the growth of certain tumors.© The Author(s) 2018.

It damages endothelial cells and causes radiation-induced inflammation. Damaged vessels inhibit the infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes into tumors, and immunosuppressive pathways are activated. They lead to the accumulation of radioresistant suppressor cells, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with the  phenotype, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs). The area of tumor hypoxia increases. Hypoxia reduces -dependent DNA damage and weakens the anti-cancer RT effect. It activates the formation of new blood vessels and leads to cancer relapse after irradiation. Irradiation may also activate the immune response through immunogenic cell death induction. This leads to the "in situ" vaccination effect. In this article, we review how changes in the TME affect radiation-induced anticancer efficacy. There is a very delicate balance between the activation of the immune system and the immunosuppression induced by RT. The effects of RT doses on immune system reactions and also on tumor vascularization remain unclear. A better understanding of these interactions will contribute to the optimization of RT treatment, which may prevent the recurrence of cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30670595>Overexpression of the C-domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme reduces melanoma growth by stimulating M1 macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) can hydrolyze many peptides and plays a central role in controlling blood pressure. Moreover, ACE overexpression in monocytes and macrophages increases resistance of mice to tumor growth. ACE is composed of two independent catalytic domains. Here, to investigate the specific role of each domain in tumor resistance, we overexpressed either WT ACE (Tg-ACE mice) or ACE lacking N- or C-domain catalytic activity (Tg-NKO and Tg-CKO mice) in the myeloid cells of mice. Tg-ACE and Tg-NKO mice exhibited strongly suppressed growth of B16-F10 melanoma because of increased ACE expression in macrophages, whereas Tg-CKO mice resisted melanoma no better than WT animals. The effect of ACE overexpression reverted to that of the WT enzyme with an ACE inhibitor but not with an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist. ACE C-domain overexpression in macrophages drove them toward a pronounced M1 phenotype upon tumor stimulation, with increased activation of NF-κB and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and decreased STAT3 and STAT6 activation. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is important for M1 activation, and TNFα blockade reverted Tg-NKO macrophages to a WT phenotype. Increased ACE C-domain expression increased the levels of reactive  species (ROS) and of the transcription factor C/EBPβ in macrophages, important stimuli for TNFα expression, and decreased expression of several  markers, including interleukin-4Rα. Natural ACE C-domain-specific substrates are not well-described, and we propose that the peptide(s) responsible for the striking ACE-mediated enhancement of myeloid function are substrates/products of the ACE C-domain.© 2019 Khan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481170>Development of brain PET imaging agents: Strategies for imaging neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.</a></h2><p>Neuroinflammation is thought to play a key role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) is an in vivo imaging technique capable of studying the biochemical processes which provide the molecular basis of disease. PET imaging of neuroinflammation, which is characterized by the activation of glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), has been traditionally studied using radiotracers targeting the translocator protein 18kDa (TSPO). However, limitations in the properties of PET radiotracers for imaging the TSPO has led to the search for alternative strategies for imaging neuroinflammation. The current review presents the current status of PET radiotracers for imaging the TSPO, and describes alternative biological targets that have gained interest for imaging of microglial activation over recent years. These include cannabinoid receptor type-2, cyclooxygenase-2, the P2X receptor, CSF1R and reactive  species and some promising radiotracers for these targets. Although a lot of advances have been made in the field of imaging neuroinflammation, current radiotracers all target the pro-inflammatory (M1) phenotype of activated microglia, since the number of known biological targets specific for the anti-inflammatory () phenotype, is still limited. In spite of these limitations, PET imaging studies comparing the temporal relationship between Aβ plaque formation, microglial activation, and the formation of tau-based neurofibrillary tangles would provide valuable information on the "neuroinflammatory hypothesis" of neurodegeneration. The development of a suitable radiotracer for imaging the anti-inflammatory,  microglia would represent a great advance in imaging neuroinflammation since this would allow for imaging of the dynamics of microglial activation in different diseases.© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Chemokine-like factor 1 (CKLF1) is a chemokine that exhibits increased expression in the ischemic brain. Dysregulation of microglia polarization dynamics is a mechanism of injury expansion poststroke.The aim of present study was to investigate the effects of IMM-H004 on cell viability and microglia phenotypes in BV2 microglia suffering from -glucose deprivation/reperfusion and discussing the involvement of CKLF1 and possible mechanisms.IMM-H004 protected BV2 microglia from -glucose deprivation/reperfusion-induced toxicity. We found that the expression of CKLF1 was increased in BV2 microglia with -glucose deprivation/reperfusion, and IMM-H004 decreased this specially increased expression. Moreover, -glucose deprivation/reperfusion induced the BV2 microglia to polarize toward an M1 phenotype, and IMM-H004 modulated the polarization shift from the M1 phenotype and skewed toward the  phenotype, followed by suppressing the excessive inflammatory response and improving recovery. CKLF1 modulated BV2 microglia toward M1 polarization and induced an inflammatory response. By using receptor inhibitors, we found that OGD/R induced microglia polarization partly through CC chemokine receptor 4. Furthermore, the Co-IP assay showed that IMM-H004 decreased the amount of CKLF1 binding to CC chemokine receptor 4 in the BV2 microglia -glucose deprivation/reperfusion model.IMM-H004 protects BV2 microglia against -glucose deprivation/reperfusion injury partly by modulating microglia polarization and further regulating the inflammatory response. The CKLF1/CCR4 axis may be involved in the protective effects of IMM-H004 modulating microglia polarization.Copyright © 2019.

To understand its role in liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, we studied its impact on orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) and Kupffer cells (KCs) polarization and its underlying mechanisms. We first investigated the reactive  species (ROS) accumulation and cytokines profile of KCs, intracellular ROS and the mRNA level of pro-inflammatory cytokines were downregulated while the mRNA level of anti-inflammatory cytokine was upregulated by the pretreatment of Curcumin; Then the liver injury was detected by histopathological examination and liver function. Pretreatment with Curcumin significantly alleviated liver injury while improving liver function and overall post-transplantation survival compared with the control groups. The Western blotting showed that Curcumin inhibited the function of KCs via down-regulating the nuclear factor κb (NF-κb) signaling pathway by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and flow cytometry revealed that Curcumin suppressed pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1) of KCs while promoting its anti-inflammatory phenotype () polarization. These results showed that Curcumin may exert positive effects on I/R injury after OLT through activating PPARγ by inhibiting the activation of NF-κb pathway and remodeling the polarization of KCs. This may reveal a potential therapy for I/R injury after liver transplantation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that antibiotics cause mammalian mitochondrial damage while causing bacterial lethality. Mitochondrial toxicity of azithromycin in human mammary epithelia MCF-12A and fibroblasts were tested by fluorescent and transmission electron microscopy. Gene expression and DNA damage were tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and ELISA. We found azithromycin suppressed the mitochondrial membrane potential gradient of MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts. Ultrastructure exams showed that the antibiotic caused vacuolated and swollen mitochondria with disrupted cristae in MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts compared to the morphology of mitochondria in the cells without antibiotic treatment. Fluorescent microscopy also showed azithromycin-induced mitochondrial reactive  species (ROS), superoxide, after 3 h of culture. The DNA oxidative damage product, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG, significantly increased in the media after MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts were cultured in the media containing azithromycin for 24 h. Azithromycin upregulated gene expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (), glycolytic enzymes including hexokinase 2 (), phosphofructokinase 1 (), pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme  (), and glucose transporters in MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts. Lactate production also increased in the culture media. After treatment with azithromycin, healthy MCF-12A and fibroblast cells increased aerobic glycolysis-the "Warburg Effect"-to generate energy. In summary, azithromycin caused mitochondrial toxicity, ROS overproduction, DNA oxidative damage, upregulation of the  gene, and aerobic glycolysis in healthy mammalian cells. Over-usage of antibiotics could contribute to tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration and aggravate existing mitochondria-associated diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30447432>MicroRNA-155 promotes pro-inflammatory functions and augments apoptosis of monocytes/macrophages during Vibrio anguillarum infection in ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis.</a></h2><p>Upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern-recognition receptors, immune cells are recruited, and multiple antibacterial/viral signaling pathways are activated, leading to the production of immune-related cytokines, chemokines, and interferons along with further activation of the adaptive immune response. MicroRNAs (miRs) play essential roles in regulating such immune signaling pathways, as well as the biological activities of immune cells; however, knowledge regarding the roles of miRs in the immune-related function of monocytes/macrophages (MO/MΦ) remains limited in teleosts. In the present study, we addressed the effects of miR-155 on Vibrio anguillarum-infected MO/MΦ. Our results showed that miR-155 augmented MO/MΦ expression of proinflammatory cytokines and attenuated the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, the phagocytosis and bacteria-killing abilities of these cells were boosted by miR-155 administration, which also promoted M1-type polarization but inhibited -type polarization. Furthermore, the V. anguillarum-infection-induced apoptosis was also enhanced by miR-155 mimic transfection, which might have been due to excessive inflammation or the accumulation of reactive  species. These results represent the first report providing a detailed account of the regulatory roles of miR-155 on MO/MΦ functions in teleosts and offer insight into the evolutionary history of miR-155-mediated regulation of host immune responses.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to investigate the response of Metrnl protein and IL-4 in overweight women during exercise in temperate, warm and cold water. Materials and methods Thirteen overweight young women (mean age 25.21 ± 3.27 years, body mass index 26.43 ± 1.34 kg/) were selected randomly and performed three sessions of interval exercise (40 min per session, 65% of maximum  consumption) in non-consecutive days in temperate (24-25 °C), warm (36.5-37.5 °C) and cold (16.5-17.5 °C) water. Blood sampling was done immediately before and after exercise. Results The Metrnl level significantly increased after exercise in temperate and warm water (p = 0.0001) and significantly decreased in cold water (p = 0.0001). IL-4 level significantly increased after exercise in warm water (p = 0.003), while there was no significant change after exercise in temperate and cold water. Conclusions Exercise in warm water appears to stimulate and accumulate immune cells compared to temperate and cold water.

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (iDXA) assessed body composition and a Bruce protocol treadmill test assessed aerobic fitness at baseline and week 11. At baseline, week 6 and week 11 a waist worn accelerometer measured physical activity and sedentary behavior. Physical activity was measured throughout the program with a wrist worn accelerometer.The results from the mixed-design ANOVA show that fat mass (p < .000) and fat percentage (p < .000) decreased for all three groups as a main effect of time. Sedentary behavior did not change (p>0.05) for all three groups. Moderate intensity physical activity increased significantly from pre-test to week 6 (p<0.05), then decreased from week 6 to post-test (p<0.05), with no significant changes observed from pre-test to post-test (p>0.05) for all groups. No changes in VO2 were observed (p>0.05) for all groups.Continuous or intermittent walking activity produce similar benefits on body weight, fat mass and body fat percentage in sedentary employees. Meanwhile, intermittent walking allowed these sedentary employees to increase lean mass and fat free mass. Intermittent walking could provide at least similar benefits on body composition compared to a continuous walking program.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666108>Curcumin nanoparticles are a promising anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory agent for treating periprosthetic joint infections.</a></h2><p>Periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) have a high incidence of recurrence after total joint replacement and are difficult to treat by debridement or antibiotic treatment.

Curcumin nanoparticles (CURN) were developed to overcome this limitation.In this study, the therapeutic effects of CURN and their anti-inflammatory functions were investigated in a  biofilm-induced PJIs model.CURN first attenuated the biofilm-induced expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and then regulated M1- and -phenotypic MDSC expression. Down-regulation of cytokines and reactive  species was considered as the mechanism of CURN in reversing the suppression of T cell proliferation.

To correlate STS with cancer metabolism, we determined the effects of STS on aerobic glycolysis. STS overexpression increased cellular levels of lactic acid, the final product of aerobic glycolysis. Moreover, STS suppressed the  consumption rate (OCR), which represents mitochondrial respiration. Inhibition of STS by the specific inhibitor STX064 recovered STS-induced OCR repression and lactic acid over-production. DHEA, but not DHEA-S, suppressed the OCR level and enhanced lactic acid production. To understand the molecular mechanism of STS-induced cancer metabolism, we measured the expression of glycolytic enzymes hexokinase 2 (HK2) and pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), which was highly upregulated by STS and DHEA at both protein and mRNA levels. HIF1α is a key mediator of aerobic glycolysis, and STS enhanced HIF1α promoter activity, mRNA expression, and protein expression. Down-regulation of HIF1α by siRNA suppressed the HK2 and PKM2 expression induced by both STS and DHEA. HIF1α siRNA also recovered the OCR repression and lactic acid over-production induced by both STS and DHEA. To explore the mechanism in vivo, we produced transgenic mice overexpressing STS and found that STS expression was particularly enhanced in the lung. Consistent with our in vitro results, the expression of HIF1α, HK2, and PKM2 was also increased in mouse lung tissues. In conclusion, we suggest that STS may induce aerobic glycolysis through enhancing HIF1α expression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The same measures were obtained for their 15-16 year-old children between 2007 and 2015 (Next Generation Study, n=343). Fitness was defined as maximal aerobic capacity (V'O2max). Height and weight were measured in all participants and fitness was adjusted for weight (V'O2max/kg).The Next Generation participants were, on average, heavier than the Dunedin Study participants had been, and had higher body mass index values (kg/). Unadjusted V'O2max values for boys did not differ between generations, but were lower in Next Generation girls compared to Dunedin Study girls. For both sexes, the Next Generation participants had lower weight-adjusted V'O2max values than the Dunedin Study participants. Compared to their parents, weight-adjusted V'O2max values were approximately 25% lower in girls and 15% lower in boys.Overall adolescents today appear to be less fit and heavier than their parents were at the same age. The decline in fitness over a generation is particularly evident in adolescent girls, although boys also have lower levels of fitness once body weight has been taken into account.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391270>Attenuation of Equine Lentivirus Alters Mitochondrial Protein Expression Profile from Inflammation to Apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is an equine lentivirus similar to HIV-1, targets host immune cells, and causes a life-long infection in horses. The Chinese live EIAV vaccine is attenuated from long-term passaging of a highly virulent strain  The parent pathogenic strain (EIAV) induces a host inflammatory storm to cause severe pathological injury of animals. However, the vaccine strain (EIAV) induces a high level of apoptosis to eliminate infected cells. To investigate how these processes are regulated, we performed a comparative proteomics analysis and functional study in equine monocyte-derived macrophages (eMDMs) and found that the divergent mitochondrial protein expression profiles caused by EIAV strains with different virulence led to disparate mitochondrial function, morphology, and metabolism. This in turn promoted the distinct transformation of macrophage inflammatory polarization and intrinsic apoptosis. In EIAV-infected cells, a high level of glycolysis and increased mitochondrial fragmentation were induced, resulting in the M1-polarized proinflammatory-type transformation of macrophages and the subsequent production of a strong inflammatory response. Following infection with EIAV, the infected cells were transformed into -polarized anti-inflammatory macrophages by inhibition of glycolysis. In this case, a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential and impairment of the electron transport chain led to increased levels of apoptosis and reactive  species. These results correlated with viral pathogenicity loss and may help provide an understanding of the key mechanism of lentiviral attenuation. Following viral infection, the working pattern and function of the cell can be transformed through the impact on mitochondria. It still unknown how the mitochondrial response changes in cells infected with viruses in the process of virulence attenuation. EIAV is the only effective lentiviral vaccine for large-scale use in the world. EIAV is the parent pathogenic strain. Unlike EIAV-induced inflammation storms, EIAV can induce high levels of apoptosis. For the first time, we found that, after the mitochondrial protein expression profile is altered, EIAV-infected cells are transformed into M1-polarized-type macrophages and cause inflammatory injury and that the intrinsic apoptosis pathway is activated in EIAV-infected cells. These studies shed light on how the mitochondrial protein expression profile changes between cells infected by pathogenic lentivirus strains and cells infected by attenuated lentivirus strains to drive different cellular responses, especially from inflammation to apoptosis.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30837602>4-Hexylresorcinol and silk sericin increase the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor via different pathways.</a></h2><p>Angiogenesis plays an important role in active inflammation and wound healing.

Silk sericin increased production of reactive  species (ROS), whereas 4HR decreased ROS. M1 markers were increased by silk sericin treatment, and  markers were increased by 4HR treatment. VEGF and angiogenin expression were higher in rats treated with a 4HR-incorporated silk mat than in rats treated with a silk mat alone. In conclusion, silk sericin and 4HR increased VEGF expression in RAW264.7 cells via HIF-mediated and MMP-mediated pathways, respectively. Silk sericin exerted like pro-oxidant effects and 4HR exerted anti-oxidant effects. Rats treated with a 4HR-incorporated silk mat showed higher levels of VEGF and angiogenin than those treated with a silk mat alone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30462710>Association between sleep-disordered breathing and breast cancer aggressiveness.</a></h2><p>Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been associated with cancer aggressiveness, but studies focused on specific tumors are lacking. In this pilot study we investigated whether SDB is associated with breast cancer (BC) aggressiveness.83 consecutive women <65 years diagnosed with primary BC underwent a home respiratory polygraphy. Markers of SDB severity included the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and the 4%  desaturation index (ODI4). The Ki67 proliferation index, lack of hormone receptors (HR-), Nottingham Histological Grade (NHG), and tumor stage were used as markers of BC aggressiveness. The association between SDB and molecular subtypes of BC was also assessed.The mean (SD) age was 48.8 (8.8) years and body mass index was 27.4 (5.4) Kg/. 42 women (50.6%) were post-menopausal. The median (IQR) AHI was 5.1 (2-9.4), and ODI4 was 1.5 (0.5-5.8). The median (IQR) AHI did not differ between the groups with Ki67>28% and Ki67<29% [5.1 (2.6-8.3) vs 5.0 (1.5-10), p = 0.89)], HR- and HR+ [5.7 (1.6-12.4) vs 4.9 (2-9.4), p = 0.68], NHG (Grade3, Grade2, and Grade1; p = 0.86), tumor stage (stage III-IV, stage II, and stage I; p = 0.62), or molecular subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2, and triple negative; p = 0.90). The prevalence of an AHI≥5 did not differ between the groups with Ki67>28% and Ki67<29% (51.2% vs 52.3%, p = 0.90), HR- and HR+ (58.3% vs 49.1%, p = 0.47), NHG categories (p = 0.89), different tumor stages (p = 0.71), or molecular subtypes (p = 0.73).

Microbial communities provide the enzymatic machinery and the metabolic pathways that contribute to food digestion, xenobiotic metabolism, and production of a variety of bioactive molecules. These include vitamins, amino acids, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and metabolites, which are essential for the interconnected pathways of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid/Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and amino acid and fatty acid metabolism. Recent studies have been elucidating how nutrients that fuel the metabolic processes impact on the ways immune cells, in particular, macrophages, respond to different stimuli under physiological and pathological conditions and become activated and acquire a specialized function. The two major inflammatory phenotypes of macrophages are controlled through differential consumption of glucose, glutamine, and . M1 phenotype is triggered by polarization signal from bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Th1 proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-, TNF-, and IL-1, or both, whereas  phenotype is triggered by Th2 cytokines such as interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and TGF, or glucocorticoids. Glucose utilization and production of chemical mediators including ATP, reactive  species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and NADPH support effector activities of M1 macrophages. Dysbiosis is an imbalance of commensal and pathogenic bacteria and the production of microbial antigens and metabolites. It is now known that the gut microbiota-derived products induce low-grade inflammatory activation of tissue-resident macrophages and contribute to metabolic and degenerative diseases, including diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. Here, we update the potential interplay of host gut microbiome dysbiosis and metabolic diseases. We also summarize on advances on fecal therapy, probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotics, and nutrients and small molecule inhibitors of metabolic pathway enzymes as prophylactic and therapeutic agents for metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29898626>Glucoraphanin: a broccoli sprout extract that ameliorates obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a low-grade sustained inflammatory state that causes oxidative stress in different metabolic tissues, which leads to insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Particularly, obesity-induced metabolic endotoxemia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and inflammation. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key regulator of antioxidant signaling that serves as a primary cellular defense against the cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress. Pharmacological stimulation of Nrf2 mitigates obesity and insulin resistance in mice; however, Nrf2 activators are not clinically available due to biosafety concerns. A recent study demonstrated that glucoraphanin, a precursor of the Nrf2 activator sulforaphane, ameliorates obesity by enhancing energy expenditure and browning of white adipose tissue, and attenuates obesity-related inflammation and insulin resistance by polarizing  macrophages and reducing metabolic endotoxemia. Thus, this review focuses on the efficiency and safety of glucoraphanin in alleviating obesity, insulin resistance, and NAFLD.

NC-MKM, Graesiella emersonii NC-M1, Scenedesmus acutus NC-, and Chlorophyta sp. NC-M5 were studied. Among them, G. emersonii NC-M1 recorded the highest percentage increase in lipid content (140.3%) and neutral lipid (50.9%) under Zn-supplemented condition compared to the control. Also, it showed a 105% and 41.88% increase in lipid yield and neutral lipid under Fe-supplemented condition compared to the control. However, Chlorella sp.

The enhanced production of reactive  species (ROS) and antioxidant enzyme (SOD and POD) under Fe-, Zn-, and Mo-supplemented condition supports the lipid accumulation. FAME analysis showed that the overall percentage of SFA and MUFA increased after the addition of Fe, Zn, and Mo in a culture medium compared to the control which is vital for a good-quality biodiesel.

Particularly, the modulatory action of ASTX in the interplay between nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) to exert its anti-inflammatory effect in macrophages is unknown. The effect of ASTX on mRNA and protein expression of pro-inflammatory and antioxidant genes and/or cellular reactive  species (ROS) accumulation were determined in RAW 264.7 macrophages, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from wild-type (WT) and Nrf2-deficient mice, and/or splenocytes and peritoneal macrophages of obese mice fed ASTX. The effect of ASTX on M1 and  macrophage polarization was evaluated in BMDM. ASTX significantly decreased LPS-induced mRNA expression of interleukin 6 (Il-6) and Il-1β by inhibiting nuclear translocation of NFκB p65; and attenuated LPS-induced ROS with an increase in NRF2 nuclear translocation, concomitantly decreasing NADPH oxidase 2 expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages. In BMDM of WT and Nrf2-deficient mice, ASTX decreased basal and LPS-induced ROS accumulation. The induction of Il-6 mRNA by LPS was repressed by ASTX in both types of BMDM while Il-1β mRNA was decreased only in WT BMDM. Furthermore, ASTX consumption lowered LPS sensitivity of splenocytes in obese mice. ASTX decreased M1 polarization of BMDM while increasing  polarization. ASTX exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting nuclear translocation of NFκB p65 and by preventing ROS accumulation in NRF2-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Thus, ASTX is an agent with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may be used for the prevention of inflammatory conditions.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Accordingly, we constructed a kind of multifunctional nanoparticles (NPs) with macrophage transformation and  (O) generation characteristics, to regulate the tumor microenvironment.  In this study, we synthesized mesoporous Prussian blue (MPB) NPs with low molecular weight hyaluronic acid (LMWHA) surface modification (LMWHA-MPB), and discovered that LMWHA-MPB could be used as an in situ macrophages converter and O generator.   results showed after uptake by  macrophages, LMWHA-MPB displayed the potential in remodeling tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) phenotype (pro-tumor →anti-tumor M1), and anti-metastatic effect on 4T1 cells. Furthermore,  visualized near-infrared (NIR) imaging data proved IR783 labeled LMWHA-MPB NPs could selectively accumulate in tumor sites.

Modulation of the functions of immune cells in different environments is crucial for managing infection and inferior bone integration via immunomodulation. In this work, sodium butyrate, a fermentation product of gut microbiota, was loaded onto 3D porous sulfonated polyetheretherketone (SP) to modulate the immune responses of cells in different environments. Evaluation of in vitro antibacterial effects showed that sodium butyrate-loaded SP exhibited superior antibacterial activity, especially in the samples containing high concentrations of sodium butyrate. Under bacterial stimulation, the phagocytic activity of macrophages increased with an increase in the sodium butyrate concentration via the production of reactive  species (ROS), which favoured bactericidal activity in the implant-associated infection stage. For bacterial elimination, sodium butyrate-containing SP could polarize macrophages to the  phenotype and subsequently stimulate anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion, which is considered beneficial for bone regeneration in the tissue repair stage. In vitro osteogenesis was evaluated and the results demonstrated that treatment with sodium butyrate-containing SP increased the expression of osteogenic genes and proteins. An in vivo rat osteomyelitis model was used to evaluate the protective effect of the SP-loaded with sodium butyrate on bone destruction and osteolysis under infection conditions. To study osteogenesis in vivo, a rat femoral model without infection was used. The results indicated that the SP-B2 group exhibited superior anti-infection capacity and induced new bone formation around the implant in vivo. Treatment with sodium butyrate-containing porous SP modulated the macrophage response under different stimuli, thereby serving as a new approach for the design of smart implant materials with superior antibacterial and bone repair properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550528>Quercetin alleviates rat osteoarthritis by inhibiting inflammation and apoptosis of chondrocytes, modulating synovial macrophages polarization to  macrophages.</a></h2><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive joint disorder that is primarily characterized by the degeneration and destruction of the articular cartilage. Cartilage matrix degradation, production of proinflammatory mediators, chondrocyte apoptosis and activation of macrophages in the synovial are involved in OA pathogenesis. Current non-surgical therapies for OA mainly aim at relieving pain but can barely alleviate the progression of OA. Quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid has shown potent anti-inflammatory effects, however, its effects and underlying mechanisms on OA have seldom been systematically illuminated. In this study, we explored the protective effects of quercetin on repairing OA-induced cartilage injuries and its possible mechanisms. In vitro, quercetin remarkably suppressed the expression of matrix degrading proteases and inflammatory mediators, meantime promoted the production of cartilage anabolic factors in interleukin-1β-induced (IL-1β) rat chondrocytes. In addition, quercetin exhibited anti-apoptotic effects by decreasing intracellular reactive  species (ROS), restoring mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and inhibiting the Caspase-3 pathway in apoptotic rat chondrocytes. Moreover, quercetin induced  polarization of macrophages and upregulated the expression of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which in turn created a pro-chondrogenic microenvironment for chondrocytes and promoted the synthesis of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in chondrocytes. In vivo, intra-articular injection of quercetin alleviated the degradation of the cartilage and the apoptosis of chondrocytes in a rat OA model. Moreover, the expression of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 in the synovial fluid and the ratio of  macrophages in the synovial membrane were elevated. In summary, our study proves that quercetin exerts chondroprotective effects by inhibiting inflammation and apoptosis of chondrocytes, modulating synovial macrophages polarization to  macrophages and creating a pro-chondrogenic environment for chondrocytes to enhance cartilage repair under OA environment. It is suggested that quercetin may serve as a potential drug for OA treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The patients underwent cardiorespiratory sleep recording and complete daytime pulmonary function tests including arterial blood gases.This prospective cohort was predominately male (86.3%) with a mean age of 67.3 years (59.3; 75.7) and a mean BMI of 26.7 kg/ (23.7; 31.1). The patients were mainly in NYHA classes II and III with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 38%. 102 (55.61%) patients had ischemic cardiomyopathy with multiple comorbidities, and 64 (35.06%) had airflow obstruction. 8 (4.37%) patients had hypoxemia both day and night, and 151 (82.5%) had nocturnal hypoxemia only. All but 3 patients had sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), and either obstructive (59%) or central sleep apnea (39%) with a mean apnea-hypopnea index of 29.59/h (16.48; 48.27), an  desaturation index of 27.09/h (14.09; 45.25), time below 90% saturation of 18 min (2; 64), and a mean nocturnal saturation of 93% (92; 94). Univariate analysis found nocturnal hypoxemia was associated with higher BMI and NT-proBNP levels. In multivariate analysis, only sleep apnea severity (p < 0.0001) and diurnal PaO2 remained significant.Most stable CHF patients suffer from nocturnal hypoxemia, while daytime hypoxemia is relatively rare. The degree of nocturnal hypoxemia depends on the severity of SDB. Hypoxemia phenotyping and severity could help better evaluate the need for appropriate therapy in CHF patients.© 2019 S.

X-ray single-crystal diffraction study confirms their isotipy with (Cs/Rb)Co(HO)[BPO(OH)] borophosphates crystallizing in the orthorhombic space group Pbca. The crystal structures of all compounds are based on 3D frameworks made from corrugating borophosphate layers [BPO(OH)] and trimers of MO(HO) and two MO edge-sharing octahedra. The negative charge of the framework is compensated by alkali metal cations, Rb or Cs. Structural analysis reveals the flexibility of mixed anionic frameworks of the described structural type. The Cu-member demonstrates a strong distortion of the unit cell due to the Jahn-Teller effect of the d configuration of the Cu cation. The possibility of a solid solution between different transition metals (Fe and Ni) with the formation of crystals with mixed structural positions is confirmed by an example of the (III) phase.

Emerging data indicate that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors possess immunomodulatory functions. We previously showed in a rat model of AMI that the HDAC inhibitor TSA improved tissue repair, and this was accompanied by increased DC infiltration in the infarct region, suggesting an important role of TSA in modulating DC functions. To study the potential modulatory effect of TSA on DCs, we exploited an  model of hypoxia and glucose deprivation. Culturing of DCs in the presence of 200 nM TSA improved DC survival under hypoxia and glucose deprivation. However, on a phenotypic level, TSA induced the expression of the DC co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, decreased FITC-dextran uptake, and facilitated DC migration. Moreover, TSA altered cytokine secretion by reducing the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-10, IL-12, and TGF-β. Furthermore, TSA treatment enhanced HIF-1α-dependent glycolytic gene expression and increased pyruvate kinase  by upregulating SRSF3.

Recently, we have shown that n-butylidenephthalide (BP) improves human adipose-derived stem cell (hADSC) engraftment via attenuated reactive  species (ROS) production. This prompted us to investigate whether remote transplantation of BP-pretreated hADSCs confers attenuated LVH at an established phase of hypertension. Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) aged 12 weeks were randomly allocated to receive right hamstring injection of vehicle, clinical-grade hADSCs, and BP-preconditioned hADSCs for 8 weeks. As compared with untreated SHRs, naïve hADSCs decreased the ratio of LV weight to tibia, cardiomyocyte cell size, and collagen deposition independent of hemodynamic changes. These changes were accompanied by attenuated myocardial ROS production and increased p-STAT3 levels. Compared with naïve hADSCs, BP-preconditioned hADSCs provided a further decrease of ROS and LVH and an increase of local hADSC engraftment, STAT3 phosphorylation, STAT3 activity, STAT3 nuclear translocation, myocardial IL-10 levels, and the percentage of  macrophage infiltration. SIN-1 or S3I-201 reversed the effects of BP-preconditioned ADSCs increase on myocardial IL-10 levels. Furthermore, SIN-1 abolished the phosphorylation of STAT3, whereas superoxide levels were not affected following the inhibition of STAT3. Our results highlighted the feasibility of remote transplantation of hADSCs can be considered as an alternative procedure to reverse cardiac hypertrophy even at an established phase of hypertension. BP-pretreated hADSCs polarize macrophages into  immunoregulatory cells more efficiently than naïve hADSCs via ROS/STAT3 pathway.Copyright © 2019.

We report here that natural Hz drives human MO toward -like phenotype as evidenced by the expression of  signature markers. Hz-fed MO showed elevated transcript and secreted level of IL-10, CCL17, CCL1, expression of mannose-binding lectin receptor (CD206), and arginase activity. Hz attenuated HLA-DR expression, nitric oxide, and reactive  species production, which are the features of M1 phenotype. Our data also implicate the involvement of p38 MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and NF-κB signaling pathways in skewing of Hz-fed MO toward -like type and suppression of mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. Importantly, antimalarial drugs-chloroquine and artemisinin-partially reversed activation of Hz-induced MO toward -like phenotype. Considering the limitations in the current therapeutic options for malaria, we propose that these drugs may be re-examined for their potential as immunomodulators and candidates for adjunctive treatment in malaria.© 2018 National Centre for Cell Sciences.

However, the efficacy and adverse effect profile in patients with HPS are unknown. We aimed to determine the effect of sorafenib on the alveolar-arterial  gradient (AaPO ) at 3 months in patients with HPS. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel trial of sorafenib in patients with HPS at 7 centers. A total of 28 patients with HPS were randomized to sorafenib 400 mg by mouth daily or a matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio. We found no statistically significant difference in the median change in AaPO from baseline to 12 weeks between the patients allocated to sorafenib (4.5 mm Hg; IQR, -3.8 to 7.0 mm Hg) and those allocated to placebo (-2.4 mm Hg; IQR, -4.8 to 8.2 mm Hg; P = 0.70). There was also no difference between the groups in terms of degree of intrapulmonary shunting by contrast echocardiography. Sorafenib significantly reduced circulating levels of angiogenic markers, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (P < 0.01) and TIE2-expressing  monocytes (P = 0.03), but it reduced the mental component scores of the Short Form 36 (P = 0.04), indicating a worse quality of life. In conclusion, sorafenib did not change the AaPO or other disease markers at 3 months in patients with HPS. Alternative antiangiogenic therapies or treatments targeting other pathways should be investigated.Copyright © 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30753941>Porous Se@SiO nanosphere-coated catheter accelerates prostatic urethra wound healing by modulating macrophage polarization through reactive  species-NF-κB pathway inhibition.</a></h2><p>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients experience complications after surgery. We studied oxidative stress scavenging by porous Se@SiO nanospheres in prostatic urethra wound healing after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Beagle dogs were randomly distributed into two groups after establishing TURP models. Wound recovery and oxidative stress levels were evaluated. Re-epithelialization and the macrophage distribution at the wound site were assessed by histology. The mechanism by which porous Se@SiO nanospheres regulated macrophage polarization was investigated by qRT-PCR, western blotting, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and dual luciferase reporter gene assays. Our results demonstrated that Porous Se@SiO nanosphere-coated catheters advance re-epithelization of the prostatic urethra, accelerating wound healing in beagle dogs after TURP, and improve the antioxidant capacity to inhibit oxidative stress and induced an  phenotype transition of macrophages at the wound. By restraining the function of reactive  species (ROS), porous Se@SiO nanospheres downregulated Ikk, IκB and p65 phosphorylation to block the downstream NF-κB pathway in macrophages in vitro. Since activation of NF-κB signaling cascades drives macrophage polarization, porous Se@SiO nanospheres promoted macrophage phenotype conversion from M1 to . Our findings suggest that porous Se@SiO nanosphere-coated catheters promote postoperative wound recovery in the prostatic urethra by promoting macrophage polarization toward the  phenotype through suppression of the ROS-NF-κB pathway, attenuating the inflammatory response. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The inability to effectively control post-operative inflammatory responses after surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) remains a challenge to researchers and surgeons, as it can lead to indirect cell death and ultimately delay wound healing. Macrophages at the wound site work as pivotal regulators of local inflammatory response. Here, we designed and produced a new type of catheter with a coating of porous Se@SiO nanosphere and demonstrated its role in promoting prostatic urethra wound repair by shifting macrophage polarization toward the anti-inflammatory  phenotype via suppressing ROS-NF-κB pathway. These results indicate that the use of porous Se@SiO nanosphere-coated catheter may provide a therapeutic strategy for postoperative complications during prostatic urethra wound healing to improve patient quality of life.Copyright © 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

In all, twelve healthy lean males (21·5 (sd 0·5) years old; BMI: 22·5 (sd 1·7) kg/) participated in this study. Body composition, aerobic capacity, food preferences and energy intake were assessed. They randomly completed three conditions: (i) no depletion (CON); (ii) full 24-h energy restrictions (Def-EI); and (iii) exercise condition (Def-EX). Ad libitum energy intake and food reward were assessed at the end of each session. Appetite feelings were assessed regularly. Ad libitum energy intake was higher on Def-EI (7330 (sd 2975) kJ (1752 (sd 711) kcal) compared with that on CON (5301 (sd 1205) kJ (1267 (sd 288) kcal)) (P<0·05), with no difference between CON and Def-EX (6238 (sd 1741) kJ (1491 (sd 416) kcal) (P=0·38) and between Def-EX and Def-EI (P=0·22). There was no difference in the percent energy ingested from macronutrients. Hunger was lower on CON and Def-EX compared with Def-EI (P<0·001). Satiety was higher on CON and Def-EI compared with that on Def-EX (P<0·001). There was a significant interaction condition × time for food choice fat bias (P=0·04), showing a greater preference for high-fat v. low-fat food during Def-EI and Def-EX. Although 24-h fasting leads to increased energy intake at the following test meal (without total daily energy intake difference), increased hunger profile and decreased post-meal food choice fat bias, such nutritional responses are not observed after a similar deficit induced by exercise.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31341645>Hyperglycemia exacerbates acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury by promoting liver-resident macrophage proinflammatory response via AMPK/PI3K/AKT-mediated oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Although diabetes mellitus/hyperglycemia is a risk factor for acute liver injury, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells, KCs) and oxidative stress play critical roles in the pathogenesis of toxin-induced liver injury. Here, we evaluated the role of oxidative stress in regulating KC polarization against acetaminophen (APAP)-mediated acute liver injury in a streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic murine model. Compared to the controls, hyperglycemic mice exhibited a significant increase in liver injury and intrahepatic inflammation. KCs obtained from hyperglycemic mice secreted higher levels of the proinflammatory factors, such as TNF-α and IL-6, lower levels of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10. Furthermore, enhanced oxidative stress was revealed by increased levels of reactive  species (ROS) in KCs from hyperglycemic mice post APAP treatment. In addition, ROS inhibitor NAC resulted in a significant decrease of ROS production in hyperglycemic KCs from mice posttreated with APAP. We also analyzed the role of hyperglycemia in macrophage M1/ polarization. Interestingly, we found that hyperglycemia promoted M1 polarization, but inhibited  polarization of KCs obtained from APAP-exposed livers, as evidenced by increased MCP-1 and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) gene induction but decreased Arg-1 and CD206 gene induction accompanied by increased STAT1 activation and decreased STAT6 activation. NAC restored Arg-1, CD206 gene induction, and STAT6 activation. To explore the mechanism how hyperglycemia regulates KCs polarization against APAP-induced acute liver injury, we examined the AMPK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and found decreased AMPK activation and increased AKT activation in liver and KCs from hyperglycemic mice post APAP treatment. AMPK activation by its agonist AICAR or PI3K inhibition by its antagonist LY294002 inhibited ROS production in KCs from hyperglycemic mice post APAP treatment and significantly attenuated APAP-induced liver injury in the hyperglycemic mice, compared to the control mice. Our results demonstrated that hyperglycemia exacerbated APAP-induced acute liver injury by promoting liver-resident macrophage proinflammatory response via AMPK/PI3K/AKT-mediated oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29884181>The therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cells on pulmonary myeloid cells following neonatal hyperoxic lung injury in mice.</a></h2><p>Exposure to high levels of  (hyperoxia) after birth leads to lung injury. Our aims were to investigate the modulation of myeloid cell sub-populations and the reduction of fibrosis in the lungs following administration of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) to neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia.Newborn mice were exposed to 90% O (hyperoxia) or 21% O (normoxia) from postnatal days 0-4. A sub-group of hyperoxia mice were injected intratracheally with 2.5X10 hMSCs. Using flow cytometry we assessed pulmonary immune cells at postnatal days 0, 4, 7 and 14. The following markers were chosen to identify these cells: CD45 (leukocytes), Ly6CLy6G (granulocytes), CD11bCD11c (macrophages); macrophage polarisation was assessed by F4/80 and CD206 expression. hMSCs expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and firefly luciferase (fluc) were administered via the trachea at day 4. Lung macrophages in all groups were profiled using next generation sequencing (NGS) to assess alterations in macrophage phenotype. Pulmonary collagen deposition and morphometry were assessed at days 14 and 56 respectively.At day 4, hyperoxia increased the number of pulmonary Ly6CLy6G granulocytes and F4/80CD206 macrophages but decreased F4/80CD206 macrophages. At days 7 and 14, hyperoxia increased numbers of CD45 leukocytes, CD11bCD11c alveolar macrophages and F4/80CD206 macrophages but decreased F4/80CD206 macrophages. hMSCs administration ameliorated these effects of hyperoxia, notably reducing numbers of CD11bCD11c and F4/80CD206 macrophages; in contrast, F4/80CD206 macrophages were increased. Genes characteristic of anti-inflammatory '' macrophages (Arg1, Stat6, Retnla, Mrc1, Il27ra, Chil3, and Il12b) were up-regulated, and pro-inflammatory 'M1' macrophages (Cd86, Stat1, Socs3, Slamf1, Tnf, Fcgr1, Il12b, Il6, Il1b, and Il27ra) were downregulated in isolated lung macrophages from hyperoxia-exposed mice administered hMSCs, compared to mice without hMSCs. Hydroxyproline assay at day 14 showed that the 2-fold increase in lung collagen following hyperoxia was reduced to control levels in mice administered hMSCs. By day 56 (early adulthood), hMSC administration had attenuated structural changes in hyperoxia-exposed lungs.Our findings suggest that hMSCs reduce neonatal lung injury caused by hyperoxia by modulation of macrophage phenotype. Not only did our cell-based therapy using hMSC induce structural repair, it limited the progression of pulmonary fibrosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29899113>Tribbles homolog 1 deficiency modulates function and polarization of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are essential for innate immunity and inflammatory responses and differentiate into various functional phenotypes. Tribbles homolog 1 (), a member of the mammalian Tribbles homolog pseudokinase family, has been implicated in regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and metabolism, but its role in macrophage biology has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the consequences of  deficiency on macrophage functions and M1/ polarization. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from deficient () mice exhibited elevated phagocytic capacity, correlating with up-regulation of several scavenger receptors. Concomitantly, uptake of modified low-density lipoprotein was increased in  BMDMs.  macrophages also exhibited diminished migration in the presence of the chemokine MCP-1, associated with reduced expression of the MCP-1 receptor  Furthermore,  deficiency attenuated the response of BMDMs to both M1 and  stimuli; induction of the M1-marker genes , , and  upon LPS/IFNγ stimulation and of the -marker genes , , and  upon IL-4 stimulation was reduced. Functionally,  deficiency decreased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNFα, IL-1β, and CXCL1) and reduced nitric oxide and reactive  species production in M1-polarized macrophages. Supporting the attenuated  phenotype, IL-4-stimulated  macrophages secreted less IL-10 and TGFβ. Mechanistically,  BMDMs displayed lower levels of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), resulting in reduced activation of LPS/IFNγ-mediated STAT1 signaling. Likewise, decreased levels of JAK1 along with lower activation of STAT6 and STAT3 were observed in -polarized  BMDMs. Our findings suggest that  extensively controls macrophage M1/ polarization via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31244932> microglia-derived exosomes protect the mouse brain from ischemia-reperfusion injury via exosomal miR-124.</a></h2><p> Microglia play a critical role in modulating cell death and neurobehavioral recovery in response to brain injury either by direct cell-cell interaction or indirect secretion of trophic factors. Exosomes secreted from cells are well documented to deliver bioactive molecules to recipient cells to modulate cell function. Here, we aimed to identify whether  microglia exert neuroprotection after ischemic attack through an exosome-mediated cell-cell interaction.   microglia-derived exosomes were intravenously injected into the mouse brain immediately after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Infarct volume, neurological score, and neuronal apoptosis were examined 3 days after ischemic attack. Exosome RNA and target protein expression levels in neurons and brain tissue were determined for the mechanistic study.  Our results showed that the  microglia-derived exosomes were taken up by neurons  and .  microglia-derived exosome treatment attenuated neuronal apoptosis after -glucose deprivation (p<0.05).  results showed that  microglia-derived exosome treatment significantly reduced infarct volume and attenuated behavioral deficits 3 days after transient brain ischemia (p<0.05), whereas injection of miR-124 knockdown (miR-124k/d)  microglia-derived exosomes partly reversed the neuroprotective effect. Our mechanistic study further demonstrated that ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14) was the direct downstream target of miR-124. Injection of miR-124k/d  exosomes plus the USP14 inhibitor, IU1, achieved comparable neuroprotective effect as injection of  exosomes alone.  We demonstrated that  microglia-derived exosomes attenuated ischemic brain injury and promoted neuronal survival via exosomal miR-124 and its downstream target USP14.  microglia-derived exosomes represent a promising avenue for treating ischemic stroke.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31380541>Activated graphene as a material for supercapacitor electrodes: effects of surface area, pore size distribution and hydrophilicity.</a></h2><p>Activated reduced graphene oxide (a-rGO) is a material with a rigid 3D porous structure and high specific surface area (SSA). Using variation of activation parameters and post-synthesis mechanical treatment we prepared two sets of materials with a broad range of BET (N2) SSA ∼1000-3000  g-1, and significant differences in pore size distribution and  content. The performance of activated graphene as an electrode in a supercapacitor with KOH electrolyte was correlated with the structural parameters of the materials and water sorption properties. a-rGO is a hydrophobic material as evidenced by the negligibly small BET (H2O) SSA determined using analysis of water vapor sorption isotherms. However, the total pore volume determined using water vapor sorption and sorption of liquid water is almost the same as the one found by analysis of nitrogen sorption isotherms. Ball milling is found to provide an improved bulk density of activated graphene and collapse of all pores except the smallest ones (<2 nm). A decrease in the activation temperature from 850 °C to 550 °C is found to result in materials with a narrow micropore size distribution and increased  content. Elimination of mesopores using ball milling or a lower activation temperature provided materials with better specific capacitance despite a significant decrease (by ∼30%) of the BET (N2) SSA. The best gravimetric and volumetric capacitances in KOH electrolyte were achieved not for samples with the highest value of the BET (N2) SSA but for materials with 80-90% of the total pore volume in micropores and an increased BET (H2O) SSA. Comparing the performance of electrodes prepared using rGO and a-rGO shows that a more hydrophilic surface is favorable for charge storage in supercapacitors with KOH electrolyte.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30208346>Nitrogen release and its influence on anammox bacteria during the decay of Potamogeton crispus with different values of initial debris biomass.</a></h2><p>Aquatic macrophytes play a significant role in the nutrient cycle of freshwater ecosystems. However, nutrients from plant debris release into both sediments and overlying water if not timely harvested. To date, minimal information is available regarding nutrient release and its subsequent influences on bacterial communities with decaying debris. In this study, Potamogeton crispus was used as a model plant. Debris biomass levels of 0 g (control, J-CK), 10 g dry weight (DW) (100 g DW/m, J-10 g), 40 g DW (400 g DW/, J-40 g) and 80 g DW (800 g DW/m, J-80 g) were used to simulate the different biomass densities of P. crispus in field. The physicochemical parameters of overlying water and sediment samples were analysed. The community composition of anammox bacteria in the sediment was also analysed using 16S rRNA genes as markers. The results showed that dissolved  and pH dramatically decreased, whereas total nitrogen (TN) and NH-N concentrations increased in the overlying water in the initial stage of P. crispus decomposition. However, NO-N concentration changes in the overlying water were more complicated. The concentrations of organic matter, TN and NH-N in the sediment all increased, but the rate of increase varied among the groups with different initial biomass levels, indicating that these physicochemical properties in sediment are significantly affected by debris biomass level and decay time. In addition, the order of anammox bacteria abundance was J-40 g > J-CK > J-80 g > J-10 g. Moreover, the community structure of anammox bacteria were simpler compared to that of J-CK as debris biomass level increased. The results demonstrate that P. crispus debris decomposition could affect the ecological distribution of anammox bacteria. Such influence clearly varies with varying amounts of P. crispus biomass debris.

Maximal  uptake and handgrip strength were lower in women than men. The postprandial glucose concentrations were ~8% lower, the insulin-mediated glucose uptake was ~16% greater, and the meal-induced suppression of fatty acid concentrations was significantly greater in women than in men (P < 0.05 for all). However, muscle insulin sensitivity was not different between the sexes. No differences were found in postprandial insulin secretion and clearance rates; however, the steady-state insulin clearance was ~17% lower in women.Asian women who are nonobese are more insulin-sensitive than men at the level of adipose tissue but not skeletal muscle. Therefore, sex differences in glucose tolerance are likely the result of sexual dimorphism in hepatic insulin action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30099222>Metabolic features and regulation of the healing cycle-A new model for chronic disease pathogenesis and treatment.</a></h2><p>Without healing, multicellular life on Earth would not exist. Without healing, one injury predisposes to another, leading to disability, chronic disease, accelerated aging, and death. Over 60% of adults and 30% of children and teens in the United States now live with a chronic illness. Advances in mass spectrometry and metabolomics have given scientists a new lens for studying health and disease. This study defines the healing cycle in metabolic terms and reframes the pathophysiology of chronic illness as the result of metabolic signaling abnormalities that block healing and cause the normal stages of the cell danger response (CDR) to persist abnormally. Once an injury occurs, active progress through the stages of healing is driven by sequential changes in cellular bioenergetics and the disposition of  and carbon skeletons used for fuel, signaling, defense, repair, and recovery. >100 chronic illnesses can be organized into three persistent stages of the CDR. One hundred and two targetable chemosensory G-protein coupled and ionotropic receptors are presented that regulate the CDR and healing. Metabokines are signaling molecules derived from metabolism that regulate these receptors. Reframing the pathogenesis of chronic illness in this way, as a systems problem that maintains disease, rather than focusing on remote trigger(s) that caused the initial injury, permits new research to focus on novel signaling therapies to unblock the healing cycle, and restore health when other approaches have failed.Copyright © 2018 The Author.

Inspired by its inherent porous structures, we used ZIF-8 as a structural template and a N-doping source. Tannic acid (TA) as a secondary material is uniformly coated on the surface of ZIF-8 to obtain ZIF-8@TA core-shell composites. The TA-modified shell mediates the post-formation of boron acid-polyol bond, where 1,4-benzene diboronic acid (BDBA) is used as a boron-containing reactant and doping source. After carbonization, the composite successfully turns into hollow N/B co-doped carbon with a high surface area of 936  g-1. It exhibits a pronounced ORR reactivity with an onset potential of -0.12 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) along with superb methanol cross-over tolerance and long-term stability. The first-principles calculation proves that the synergistic effect arising from N and B dopants can create active sites; therefore, the value of free energy change in the rate-determining step decreases.

In the context of neural tissue damage, the dialogue between neural and immune cells appears critical for driving regeneration, thus making the understanding of their relations pivotal. Herein, the acute response of RAW-264.7 macrophages on nanostructured reduced graphene oxide (rGO) microfibers has been evaluated through the analysis of cell parameters including proliferation, viability, intracellular content of reactive  species, cell cycle, apoptosis, and cell size and complexity. The influence of the direct contact of rGO microfibers on their polarization towards M1 and  phenotypes has been studied by analyses of both M1 (CD80) and  (CD163) markers and the secretion of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. Finally, the capability of these rGO microfibers to regulate neural stem cell differentiation has been also evaluated. Findings reveal that rGO microfibers inhibit the proliferation of RAW-264.7 macrophages without affecting their viability and cell cycle profiles. The presence of M1 and  macrophages on these microfibers was confirmed after 24 and 48 h, respectively, accompanied by a decrease in TNF-α and an increase in IL-6 cytokine secretion. These rGO microfibers were also able to support the formation of a highly interconnected neural culture composed of both neurons (map2 cells) and glial cells (vimentin cells). These findings encourage further investigation of these microfibers as attractive biomaterials to interact with immune and neural cells, attempting to support wound healing and tissue repair after implantation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30381614>Targeting Pyruvate Kinase  and Hexokinase II, Pachymic Acid Impairs Glucose Metabolism and Induces Mitochondrial Apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Pachymic acid (PA), a triterpenoid from Poria cocos, has various pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-aging, and insulin-like properties. PA has gained considerable research attention, but the mechanism of its anti-cancer effects remains unclear. In this study, pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) was discovered as a PA target via the drug affinity responsive target stability. Molecular docking and enzyme assay revealed that PA is a competing activator of PKM2, and mimics the natural activator, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. PKM2 activation should augment the flux of glycolysis. However, decreased glucose uptake and lactate production after PA treatment was observed in SK-BR-3 breast carcinoma cells, indicating a blockage or downregulation of glycolysis. The potential of previously reported triterpenoids in blocking hexokinase II (HK2) activity inspired us to investigate the inhibition effect of PA on HK2 activity. Molecular docking and enzyme assay confirmed that PA was an inhibitor of HK2, with an IC of 5.01 µM. The possible consequences of glycometabolic regulation by PA, such as dissociation of HK2 from the mitochondria, release of mitochondrial cytochrome (Cyt) c, depletion of ATP, and generation of reactive  species, were further validated. Furthermore, the details of the possible linkage of targeting PKM2 and HK2 with previously reported actions of PA were discussed.

LPS was unilaterally injected into the substantia nigra (SN) in the absence or presence of CAP or capsazepine (CZP, a TRPV1 antagonist). The SN tissues were prepared for immunohistochemical staining, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, western blot analysis, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability evaluation, and reactive  species (ROS) detection. We found that CAP prevented the degeneration of nigral dopamine neurons in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited the expression of proinflammatory mediators in the LPS-lesioned SN. CAP shifted the proinflammatory M1 microglia/macrophage population to an anti-inflammatory  state as demonstrated by decreased expression of M1 markers (i.e., inducible nitric oxide synthase; iNOS and interleukin-6) and elevated expression of  markers (i.e., arginase 1 and CD206) in the SN. RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated decreased iNOS expression and increased arginase 1 expression in the CAP-treated LPS-lesioned SN. Peroxynitrate production, reactive  species levels and oxidative damage were reduced in the CAP-treated LPS-lesioned SN. The beneficial effects of CAP were blocked by CZP, indicating TRPV1 involvement. The present data indicate that CAP regulated the M1 and  activation states of microglia/macrophage in the LPS-lesioned SN, which resulted in the survival of dopamine neurons. It is therefore likely that TRPV1 activation by CAP has therapeutic potential for treating neurodegenerative diseases, that are associated with neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, such as PD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634818>Pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylase reduces NADPH oxidase expression, oxidative stress and the progression of atherosclerotic lesions in hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice; potential implications for human atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>NADPH oxidase (Nox)-derived reactive  species (ROS) are instrumental in all inflammatory phases of atherosclerosis.

Male ApoE-/- mice, maintained on normal or high-fat, cholesterol-rich diet, were randomized to receive 10 mg/kg suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a pan-HDAC inhibitor, or its vehicle, for 4 weeks. In the human/animal studies, real-time PCR, Western blot, lipid staining, lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were employed. The protein levels of class I, class IIa, class IIb, and class IV HDAC isoenzymes were significantly elevated both in human atherosclerotic tissue samples and in atherosclerotic aorta of ApoE-/- mice. Treatment of ApoE-/- mice with SAHA reduced significantly the extent of atherosclerotic lesions, and the aortic expression of Nox subtypes, NADPH-stimulated ROS production, oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory markers. Significantly up-regulated HDAC and Nox subtypes were detected in inflammatory M1-Mac. In these cells, SAHA reduced the Nox1/2/4 transcript levels. Collectively, HDAC inhibition reduced atherosclerotic lesion progression in ApoE-/- mice, possibly by intertwined mechanisms involving negative regulation of Nox expression and inflammation. The data propose that HDAC-oriented pharmacological interventions could represent an effective therapeutic strategy in atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigate the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of APX3330 treatment in type one diabetes mellitus (T1DM) stroke rats. Adult male Wistar rats were induced with T1DM and subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and treated with either PBS or APX3330 (10mg/kg, oral gavage) starting at 24h after MCAo, and daily for 14 days. Rats were sacrificed at 14 days after MCAo and, blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability, ischemic lesion volume, immunohistochemistry, cell death assay, Western blot, real time PCR, and angiogenic ELISA array were performed. Compared to PBS treatment, APX3330 treatment of stroke in T1DM rats significantly improves neurological functional outcome, decreases lesion volume, and improves BBB integrity as well as decreases total vessel density and VEGF expression, while significantly increases arterial density in the ischemic border zone (IBZ). APX3330 significantly increases myelin density, oligodendrocyte number, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell number, synaptic protein expression, and induces  macrophage polarization in the IBZ of T1DM stroke rats. Compared to PBS treatment, APX3330 treatment significantly decreases plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts expression in the ischemic brain of T1DM stroke rats. APX3330 treatment significantly decreases cell death and MMP9 and PAI-1 gene expression in cultured primary cortical neurons subjected to high glucose and  glucose deprivation, compared to untreated control cells. APX3330 treatment increases  macrophage polarization and decreases inflammatory factor expression in the ischemic brain as well as promotes neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects after stroke in T1DM rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29855444>High intensity interval training is associated with greater impact on physical fitness, insulin sensitivity and muscle mitochondrial content in males with overweight/obesity, as opposed to continuous endurance training: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the effect of high intensity training (HIT) on physical fitness, basal respiratory exchange ratio (bRER), insulin sensitivity and muscle histology in overweight/obese men compared to continuous aerobic training (CAT).16 male participants with overweight/obesity (age: 42-57 years, body mass index: 28-36 kg/) were randomized to HIT (n=8) or CAT (n=8) for 10 weeks, twice a week. HIT was composed of 10 minutes high intensity, 10 minutes continuous aerobic, 10 minutes high intensity exercises. CAT was composed of three times 10 minutes continuous exercising.

Macrophages also play important roles in regulating iron homeostasis, and intracellular iron accumulation induces M1-type macrophage polarization which provides a potential approach to tumor immunotherapy through  tumor-associated macrophage repolarization. However, the mechanisms underlying iron-induced M1 polarization remain unclear.Western blotting, qRT-PCR, and flow cytometry were used to detect the polarization indexes in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages treated with iron, and Western bloting and qRT-PCR were used to detect p21 expression. The compound 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate was used to measure reactive  species (ROS) levels in macrophages after iron or N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) treatment. The p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) inhibitor C646 was used to inhibit p53 acetylation, and Western bloting, qRT-PCR, and immunofluorescence were used to detect p53 expression and acetylation. BALB/c mice were subcutaneously injected with H22 hepatoma cells, and macrophage polarization status was investigated after tail intravenous injection of iron. Immunohistochemical staining was used to evaluate the protein expression of cluster of differentiation 86 (CD86) and EGF-like module-containing mucin-like hormone receptor-like 1 (F4/80) in the subcutaneous tumors.Iron overload induced M1 polarization by increasing ROS production and inducing p53 acetylation in RAW cells, and reduction in ROS levels by NAC repressed M1 polarization and p53 acetylation. Inhibition of acetyl-p53 by a p300/CBP inhibitor prevented M1 polarization and inhibited p21 expression. These results showed that high ROS levels induced by iron overload polarized macrophages to the M1 subtype by enhancing p300/CBP acetyltransferase activity and promoting p53 acetylation.© 2018 The Authors.

The majority of these macrophages are believed to be alternatively activated macrophages ().Mouse bone marrow cells were differentiated into macrophages and polarized to  in vitro by treatment with IL-4 [M2a] or IL-10 [M2c] and M1 with LPS/IFN-γ as controls. Macrophage subtypes were confirmed by surface markers and characterized by gene expression profiles.Compared to M1,  showed strong pro-angiogenic activity by expressing higher mRNA for angiogenic-associated factors (Cxcl12, Vegfa, PlGF, Mmp2). M2c produced the highest levels of PlGF, Mmp2, and Cxcr4. To mimic the normal placental microenvironment,  were exposed to hypoxia and sex hormones (progesterone, estrogen). In both M2c and M2a, severe hypoxic (1%-3% O ) exposure significantly suppressed PlGF, Cxcl12, and Mmp2 mRNA, but not Vegfa, compared to normoxia (21% O ) or physiological hypoxia (5% O ). mRNA expression returned to normal when hypoxic cells were returned to normoxia. Hypoxia (1%) reduced antioxidant levels in  and re-exposure to normoxia significantly increased superoxide dismutase (Sod1, Sod2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels in M2a, and only glutathione peroxidase (Gpx1, Gpx3, Gpx4) in M2c. However, progesterone and estrogen treatment had minimal effects on angiogenic factor expression in ., particularly M2c, displayed strong pro-angiogenic potential, which decreased under severe hypoxia such as in early pregnancy. Thus, conditions that alter the placental  microenvironment or macrophage response in early pregnancy might cause aberrant angiogenesis and vascular remodeling, and lead to abnormal placental vascular development.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In this work, we tested the therapeutic role of Interleukin-19 (IL-19) in mice with MI and investigated the underlying molecular mechanism.Mice were subjected to MI by ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and treated with IL-19 (10ng g ; i.p.).Protein expression of IL-19 and its receptor in myocardium were upregulated 24 hrs post-MI in male mice. IL-19 treatment decreased infarct and apoptosis in myocardium, accompanied by enhanced haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) activities and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) formation. Pretreatment with IL-19 upregulated HO-1 expression in cultured neonatal mouse ventricular myocytes and attenuated -glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced injuries in vitro. Furthermore, IL-19 preserved cardiac function and improved survival of mice with MI. IL-19 reduced inflammatory infiltrates and suppressed formation of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. More importantly, IL-19 inhibited polarization toward proinflammatory M1 macrophages and stimulated  macrophage polarization in myocardium of mice with MI. IL-19 enhanced protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and promoted angiogenesis in myocardium of mice with MI. In addition, IL-19 treatment increased DNA-binding of the transcription factor STAT3 in myocardium of mice with MI.Treatment with exogenous IL-19 attenuated acute ischemic injury and improved survival of mice with MI.

Autosomal-dominant inheritance of a R94Q mutation in MFN2 causes the axonal subtype 2A2A which is characterized by early onset and progressive atrophy of distal muscles caused by motoneuronal degeneration. Here, we studied mitochondrial shape, respiration, cytosolic, and mitochondrial ATP content as well as mitochondrial quality control in MFN2-deficient fibroblasts stably expressing wildtype or R94Q MFN2. Under normal culture conditions, R94Q cells had slightly more fragmented mitochondria but a similar mitochondrial  consumption, membrane potential, and ATP production as wildtype cells. However, when inducing mild oxidative stress 24 h before analysis using 100 µM hydrogen peroxide, R94Q cells exhibited significantly increased respiration but decreased mitochondrial ATP production. This was accompanied by increased glucose uptake and an up-regulation of hexokinase 1 and pyruvate kinase , suggesting increased pyruvate shuttling into mitochondria. Interestingly, these changes coincided with decreased levels of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in R94Q cells. We conclude that mitochondria harboring the disease-causing R94Q mutation in MFN2 are more susceptible to oxidative stress, which causes uncoupling of respiration and ATP production possibly by a less efficient mitochondrial quality control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30978175>N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) delays post-ovulatory oocyte aging in mouse.</a></h2><p>The quality of post-ovulatory oocytes decreases with aging. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a broadly used antioxidant, on oocyte quality in mouse post-ovulatory oocyte aging in vitro. NAC at 0.6mM concentration was added to culture medium (), and the quality of oocytes was analyzed at 6h, 12h, 18h and 24h of culture. We found that the frequency of spindle defects decreased in NAC-treated oocytes compared to those without NAC treatment. NAC treatment significantly decreased abnormal distribution of cortical granules (CGs) in oocytes during aging for 18h and 24h. Decreased intracellular reactive  species (ROS) was also observed. Increased intracellular ATP levels and decreased abnormal distribution of mitochondria could be observed with NAC supplementation during post-ovulatory oocyte aging in vitro. These results indicate that NAC will maintain the quality of oocytes, and delay post-ovulatory oocyte aging as studied in the mouse.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31482976>Validation of the two-minute step test in obese with comorbibities and morbidly obese patients.</a></h2><p>Cardiopulmonary fitness assessment is a valuable resource to obtain quantitative indicators of an individual's physical performance. The cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX), considered the gold standard test for this evaluation, is costly and difficult to be accessed by the general population. In order to make this evaluation more accessible, and to better reflect the performance of daily life activities, alternative tests were proposed. Morbidly obese patients present limitations that impair physical performance assessment and could benefit from a test of shorter duration, provided it is validated. This observational study aimed to validate the two-minute step test (2MST) as a tool to evaluate functional capacity (FC) in obese with comorbidities and morbidly obese patients, compared the 2MST with CPX as a measure of physical performance, and developed a predictive equation to estimate peak  uptake (VO2) in the 2MST. The CPX and the 2MST were performed and metabolic and ventilatory parameters were recorded in 31 obese individuals (BMI>35 kg/). Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the peak VO2 best predictors. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to assess the agreement between the two methods. Peak VO2 measured by CPX and 2MST showed a strong correlation (r=0.70, P<0.001) and there was a moderate correlation between peak VO2 of the 2MST and the number of up-and-down step cycles (UDS) (r=0.55; P=0.01). The reference equation obtained was: VO2 (mL·kg-1·min-1) = 13.341 + 0.138 × total UDS - (0.183 × BMI), with an estimated standard error of 1.3 mL·kg-1·min-1. The 2MST is a viable, practical, and easily accessible test for FC.

This study aimed to determine the effects and protective mechanism of  macrophages against oxidative stress injury and apoptosis induced by calcium oxalate crystals (CaOx) in renal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) under coculture conditions.THP-1 cells were induced to differentiate into  macrophages by using phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, IL-4 and IL-13. Morphological features were observed by microscopy. Phenotypic markers were identified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). HK-2 cells were treated with 0.5 mg/mL CaOx crystals and co-cultured with  macrophages or apocynin. The viability of HK-2 cells was detected by CCK-8 assay. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity of HK-2 cells was analysed using a microplate reader. The apoptosis of HK-2 cells was examined by flow cytometry and Hoechst 33258 staining. Reactive  species (ROS) expression and mitochondrial membrane potential in HK-2 cells were detected by a fluorescence microplate reader. Western blot analysis was conducted to detect the expression of p47phox, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, cytochrome c, p38 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK, Akt and phospho-Akt.The results of morphology, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot and ELISA showed that THP-1 cells were successfully polarised to  macrophages. The results of co-culture suggested that  macrophages or apocynin significantly increased the cell viability and decreased the LDH activity and apoptosis rate after HK-2 cells were challenged with CaOx crystals. The expression of the p47phox protein and the concentration of ROS were reduced, the release of mitochondrial membrane potential and the expression of the Bcl-2 protein were upregulated and the protein expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cytochrome c was downregulated. The expression of the phosphorylated form of p38 MAPK increased. Under coculture conditions with  macrophages, the Akt protein of HK-2 cells treated with CaOx crystals was dephosphorylated, but the phosphorylated form of Akt was not reduced by apocynin. macrophages reduced the oxidative stress injury and apoptosis of HK-2 cells by downregulating the activation of NADPH oxidase, reducing the production of ROS, inhibiting the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and enhancing the phosphorylation of Akt. We have revealed one of the possible mechanisms by which  macrophages reduce the formation of kidney stones.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

His experiments were conducted in the presence of excess , but today tumor tissue is known to be a hypoxic environment. However, an increase of glycolysis and lactate production is still a valid observation. Numerous abnormalities and mutations of metabolic enzymes have been found in many cancers. For example, pyruvate kinase  has been associated with many cancers and is a major contributor to directing glycolysis into fermentation, forming lactate. Increases in several enzymes, including glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase , Rad6, or deficiency of other enzymes such as succinate dehydrogenase, all may contribute directly or indirectly to increases in lactate associated with the Warburg effect. In addition, the increased lactate and acid-base changes are modified further by monocarboxylate transporters and carbonic anhydrase, which contribute to alkalinizing tumor cells while acidifying the tumor extracellular environment. This acidification leads to cancer spread. Fully understanding the mechanisms underlying the Warburg effect should provide new approaches to cancer treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Detecting and quantifying protein oxidation is crucial for a detailed understanding of reduction-oxidation reaction (redox) signaling. We developed an Activated Thiol Sepharose-based proteomic (ATSP) approach to quantify reversible protein oxidation. ATSP can enrich HO-sensitive thiol peptides, which are more likely to contain reactive cysteines involved in redox signaling. We applied our approach to analyze hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC), a type of kidney cancer that harbors fumarate hydratase (FH)-inactivating mutations and has elevated ROS levels. Multiple proteins were oxidized in FH-deficient cells, including many metabolic proteins such as the pyruvate kinase  isoform (PKM2). Treatment of HLRCC cells with dimethyl fumarate or PKM2 activators altered PKM2 oxidation levels. Finally, we found that ATSP could detect Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2 and PKM2 oxidation in cells stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor. This newly developed redox proteomics workflow can detect reversible oxidation of reactive cysteines and can be employed to analyze multiple physiologic and pathologic conditions.-Xu, Y., Andrade, J., Ueberheide, B., Neel, B.

Interleukin (IL)-33 is a member of the IL-1 family that has been shown to influence macrophage activation and polarization, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Mitochondrial metabolism has been reported to be a central player in shaping macrophage polarization; previous studies have shown that both aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation uniquely regulate the functions of M1 and  macrophages. Whether IL-33 polarizes macrophages by reshaping mitochondrial metabolism requires further investigation. In this work, we examined the mitochondrial metabolism of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from either wild type (WT), -overexpressing, or IL-33 receptor knockout ( ) mice challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that after LPS stimulation, compared with WT BMDMs,   BMDMs had reduced cytokine production and increased numbers and activity of mitochondria  the metabolism regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-C coactivator-1 α (PGC1α). This was demonstrated by increased mitochondrial DNA copy number, mitochondria counts, mitochondria fission- and fusion-related gene expression,  consumption rates, and ATP production, and decreased glucose uptake, lactate production, and extracellular acidification rates. For -overexpressing BMDMs, the metabolic reprogramming upon LPS stimulation was similar to WT BMDMs, and was accompanied by increased M1 macrophage activity. Our findings suggested that the pleiotropic IL-33/ST2 pathway may influence the polarization and function of macrophages by regulating mitochondrial metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30271755>Biochanin a Enhances the Defense Against  Infection Through AMPK/ULK1/mTOR-Mediated Autophagy and Extracellular Traps and Reversing SPI-1-Dependent Macrophage (MΦ)  Polarization.</a></h2><p>A novel treatment regimen for bacterial infections is the pharmacological enhancement of the host's immune defenses. We demonstrated that biochanin A (BCA), an isoflavone constituent in some plants, could enhance both intra- and extracellular bactericidal activity of host cells. First, BCA could induce a complete autophagic response in nonphagocytic cells (HeLa) or macrophages (MΦ) via the AMPK/ULK1/mTOR pathway and Beclin-1-dependent manner, and BCA enhanced the killing of invading  by autophagy through reinforcing ubiquitinated adapter protein (LRSAM1, NDP52 and p62)-mediated recognition of intracellular bacteria and through the formation of autophagolysosomes. Second, we demonstrated that BCA could enhance the release of MΦ extracellular traps (METs) to remove extracellular  also via the AMPK/ULK1/mTOR pathway, not through reactive  species (ROS) pathway. Furtherly, in a -infected mouse model, BCA treatment increased intra- and extracellular bactericidal activity through the strengthening autophagy and MET production, respectively, in peritoneal MΦ, liver and spleen tissue. Additionally, our findings showed that BCA downregulated SPI-1 ( pathogenicity island 1) expression during  infection  and  to reverse the MΦ  polarization, which was different from the MΦ M1 phenotype caused by most of bacteria infection. Together, these findings suggest that BCA has an immunomodulatory effect on -infected host cells and enhances their bactericidal activity  and  through autophagy, extracellular traps and regulation of MΦ polarization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31214192>The Intra-nuclear SphK2-S1P Axis Facilitates M1-to- Shift of Microglia via Suppressing HDAC1-Mediated KLF4 Deacetylation.</a></h2><p>Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is involved in a variety of cellular responses including microglial activation and polarization. However, the impacts of S1P on ischemia-induced microglial activation and polarization remain unclear. In the present study, Sprague-Dawley rats were selected for middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) establishment and treated with S1P analog FTY720 (0.5, 1, 2 mg/kg) for 24 h. The impacts of FTY720 on -glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced microglial polarization were examined in the primary cultured microglia. FTY720 treatment could prevent ischemia-induced brain injury and neurological dysfunction, also decrease the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α and promote  microglial polarization in rats. Further, we found that FTY720 inhibited the expressions of M1 markers, but increased the expressions of  markers in the OGD-insulted microglia. And FTY720 could enhance the phagocytic function of microglia. The sphingosine kinase 1/2 (SphK1/2) or the Sphk2 inhibitor could prevent the M1 to  phenotype shift improved by FTY720, but the Sphk1 inhibitor failed to affect the roles of FTY720. Furthermore, the Sphk1/2 or Sphk2 inhibitor promoted the activities of histone deacetylase (HDAC1) and inhibited the histone acetylation of the Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) promoter regions, indicating that intra-nuclear pFTY720 inhibited HDAC1 activations and prevented KLF4 to interact with HDAC1, and thereby suppresses KLF4 deacetylation. Therefore, our data reveals that intra-nuclear SphK2-S1P axis might facilitate the transformation of microglial polarization from M1 to  phenotype, which might be intra-nuclear regulatory mechanisms of FTY720-prevented neuroinflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31249524>Metabolism of IMM-H004 and Its Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Analysis in Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injured Rats.</a></h2><p>IMM-H004, a derivative of coumarin, is a promising candidate for the treatment of cerebral ischemia. The pharmacodynamic mechanisms of IMM-H004 are still under exploration. The present study was conducted to explore the pharmacoactive substances of IMM-H004 from the perspective of drug metabolism. Four metabolites of IMM-H004 including demethylated metabolites M1 and , glucuronide conjugate IMM-H004G (M3), and sulfated conjugate M4 were found in rats . IMM-H004G was the major metabolite in rats and cultured human hepatocytes, and uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) was found to catalyze the metabolism of IMM-H004 in human liver microsomes (HLMs) and rat liver microsomes (RLMs) with high capacity (  at 3.25 and 5.04 nmol/min/mg protein). Among 13 recombinant human UGT isoforms, UGT1A7, 1A9, 1A8, and 1A1 appeared to be primarily responsible for IMM-H004G formation. The exposure and duration of IMM-H004G (28,948 h × ng/ml of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), 6.61 h of  ) was much higher than that of the parent drug (1,638 h × ng/ml of AUC, 0.42 h of  ) in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) rats, consistent with the malondialdehyde (MDA) inhibition effect for at least 10 h. Further pharmacological study revealed that IMM-H004G exhibited a similar neuroprotective activity to that of the parent drug on both -glucose deprivation injured PC12 cells and transient MCAO/R injured rats. These results demonstrate that both prototype and IMM-H004G are the active pharmaceutical substances, and IMM-H004G, at least in part, contributes to the maintenance of anti-cerebral ischemia efficacy of IMM-H004.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30301887>Loss of pyruvate kinase  limits growth and triggers innate immune signaling in endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Despite their inherent proximity to circulating  and nutrients, endothelial cells (ECs) oxidize only a minor fraction of glucose in mitochondria, a metabolic specialization that is poorly understood. Here we show that the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) limits glucose oxidation, and maintains the growth and epigenetic state of ECs. We find that loss of PKM2 alters mitochondrial substrate utilization and impairs EC proliferation and migration in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that the NF-κB transcription factor RELB is responsive to PKM2 loss, limiting EC growth through the regulation of P53. Furthermore, S-adenosylmethionine synthesis is impaired in the absence of PKM2, resulting in DNA hypomethylation, de-repression of endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) and activation of antiviral innate immune signalling.

To normalize MAP fluid therapy had to be continued till t4, with the total infused volume of 4.5±0.8 l.In the current experiment bleeding led to hemorrhagic shock, while MAP remained higher than 65 mmHg. Furthermore, MAP was unable to indicate the normalization of SVI, CI and PPV that resulted in unnecessary fluid administration.

The presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) has been linked to their therapy resistance. Molecular and cellular components of the tumor microenvironment also play a fundamental role in the aggressiveness of these tumors. In particular, high levels of hypoxia and reactive  species participate in several aspects of GBM biology. Moreover, GBM contains a large number of macrophages, which normally behave as immunosuppressive tumor-supportive cells. In fact, the presence of both, hypoxia and -like macrophages, correlates with malignancy and poor prognosis in gliomas. Antioxidant agents, as nutritional supplements, might have antitumor activity. Ocoxin® oral solution (OOS), in particular, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, as well as antitumor properties in several neoplasia, without known side effects. Here, we describe how OOS affects stem cell properties in certain GBMs, slowing down their tumor growth. In parallel, OOS has a direct effect on macrophage polarization  and , inhibiting the protumoral features of  macrophages. Therefore, OOS could be a feasible candidate to be used in combination therapies during GBM treatment because it can target the highly resilient CSCs as well as their supportive immune microenvironment, without adding toxicity to conventional treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713668>Effects of hydrogen on polarization of macrophages and microglia in a stroke model.</a></h2><p>It has been confirmed that inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. The polarization of microglia as an important participant in the inflammation following stroke is also found to be involved in stroke. This study aimed to investigate the effects of hydrogen gas on the polarization of macrophages/microglia . Raw264.7 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharides and then exposed to hydrogen. The microglia were treated with the supernatant from  and glucose deprivation-treated neurons and then exposed to hydrogen. The phenotypes of Raw 264.7 cells and microglia were determined by flow cytometry, and cell morphology was observed. Results showed lipopolysaccharides significantly increased the M1 macrophages, and the supernatant from  and glucose deprivation-treated neurons dramatically elevated the proportion of M1 microglia, but both treatments had little influence on the  cells. In addition, hydrogen treatment significantly inhibited the increase in M1 cells, but had no influence on  ones. Our findings suggest that the neuroprotection of hydrogen may be related to its regulation of microglia in the nervous system after stroke.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30972670>Performance evaluation of a photochemical model using different boundary conditions over the urban and industrialized metropolitan area of Vitória, Brazil.</a></h2><p>Metropolitan areas may suffer with increase of air pollution due to the growth of urbanization, transportation, and industrial sectors. The Metropolitan Area of Vitória (MAV) in Brazil is facing air pollution problems, especially because of the urbanization of past years and of having many industries inside the metropolitan area. Developing air quality system is crucial to understand the air pollution mechanism over these areas. However, having a good input dataset for applying on photochemical models is hard and requires quite of research. One input file for air quality modeling which can play a key role on results is the lateral boundary conditions (LBC). This study aimed to investigate the influence of LBC over CMAQ simulation for particulate matter and ozone over MAV by applying four different methods as LBC during August 2010. The first scenario (M1) is based on a fixed, time-independent boundary conditions with zero concentrations for all pollutants; the second scenario () used a fixed, time-independent concentration values, with average values from local monitoring stations; the third CMAQ nesting scenario (M3) used the nested boundary conditions varying with time from a previous simulation with CMAQ over a larger modeling domain, centered on MAV; and finally, the fourth GEOS-Chem scenario (M4) used the boundary conditions varying with time from simulations of global model GEOS-Chem. All scenarios runs are based on the same meteorology conditions and pollutant emissions. The air quality simulations were made over a domain 61 × 79 km centered on coordinates - 20.25° S, - 40.28° W with a resolution of 1 km. The results were evaluated with the measured data from the local monitoring stations. Overall, significant differences on concentrations and number of chemical species between the LBC scenarios are shown across all LBC scenarios. The M3 and M4 dynamic LBC scenarios showed the best performances over ozone estimates while M1 and  had poor performance. Although no LBC scenarios do not seem to have a great influence on total PM and PM concentrations, individual PM species like Na, NO, and NHconcentrations are influenced by the dynamic LBC approach, since those hourly individual PM species from CMAQ nesting approach (M3) and GEOS-Chem model (M4) were used as an input to LBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31439648>Role of CCR2 in the Development of Streptozotocin-Treated Diabetic Cardiomyopathy.</a></h2><p>CCR2 has been proven to play an important role in diabetes. However, the role of CCR2 in diabetic cardiomyopathy has not been examined. In this study, we investigated the effects of cardiac CCR2 on diabetic cardiomyopathy. We created a model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy. Expression of CCR2 was upregulated in the hearts of STZ-induced diabetic mice. CCR2 knockout significantly improved STZ-induced cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis. Moreover, deletion of CCR2 inhibited STZ-induced apoptosis and the production of STZ-induced reactive  species in the heart. CCR2 knockout resulted in  polarization in hearts of STZ-treated mice. Treatment with a CCR2 inhibitor reversed hyperglycemia-induced cardiac dysfunction in  mice. These results suggest that CCR2-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in the heart are involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy and that CCR2 could be a novel target for therapy.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496685>Paclitaxel-loaded biodegradable ROS-sensitive nanoparticles for cancer therapy.</a></h2><p>Reactive  species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, trigger biodegradation of polymer-based nanoparticles (NPs) bearing pinacol-type boronic ester groups. These NPs may selectively release their cargo, in this case paclitaxel (PTX), at the high levels of ROS present in the intracellular environment of inflamed tissues and most tumors.The main objective was to determine anti-tumor efficacy of PTX-loaded ROS-sensitive NPs and to examine whether macrophage infiltration had any impact on treatment efficacy.NPs were synthesized and their characteristics in the presence of HO were demonstrated. Both confocal microscopy as well as flow cytometry approaches were used to determine degradation of ROS-sensitive NPs. HeLa cells were cultured in vitro and used to establish tumor xenografts in nude mice. In vivo experiments were performed to understand toxicity, biodistribution and anti-tumor efficacy of the NPs. Moreover, we performed immunohistochemistry on tumor sections to study infiltration of M1 and  subsets of macrophages.We demonstrated that PTX delivered in NPs containing a ROS-sensitive polymer exhibits a better anti-tumor efficacy than PTX in NPs containing ROS-non-sensitive polymer, free PTX or Abraxane (nab-PTX). The biodistribution revealed that ROS-sensitive NPs exhibit retention in liver, spleen and lungs, suggesting a potential to target cancer metastasizing to these organs. Finally, we demonstrated a correlation between infiltrated macrophage subsets and treatment efficacy, possibly contributing to the efficient anti-tumor effects.Treatment with ROS-sensitive NPs containing PTX gave an improved therapeutic effect in HeLa xenografts than their counterpart, free PTX or nab-PTX. Our data revealed a correlation between macrophage infiltration and efficiency of the different antitumor treatments, as the most effective NPs resulted in the highest infiltration of the anti-tumorigenic M1 macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620895>The protective effects of β-caryophyllene on LPS-induced primary microglia M/M imbalance: A mechanistic evaluation.</a></h2><p>Neuroinflammation is observed as a routine characterization of neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia, multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's diseases (AD). Scientific evidence propounds both of the neuromodulatory and immunomodulatory effects of CB in the immune system. β-Caryophyllene (BCP) is a dietary selective CB agonist, which deserves the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects at both low and high doses through activation of the CB receptor.In this study, we investigated the protective effects of a broad range concentration of BCP against LPS-induced primary microglia cells inflammation and M/M imbalance and identifying the portion of the involvement of related signaling pathways on BCP effects using pharmacological antagonists of CB, PPAR-γ, and sphingomyelinase (SMase).The protective effects of BCP on LPS-induced microglia imbalance is provided by the M healing phenotype of microglia, releasing the anti-inflammatory (IL-10, Arg-1, and urea) and anti-oxidant (GSH) parameters and reducing the inflammatory (IL-1β, TNF-α, PGE, iNOS and NO) and oxidative (ROS) biomarkers. Moreover, we showed that BCP exerts its effects through CB receptors which overproduction of ceramides by SMase at middle to higher concentrations of BCP reduce the protective activity of BCP and results in the activation of the PPAR-γ pathway.In conclusion, the low concentration of BCP has higher selective anti-inflammatory effects rather than high levels. On this occasion, BCP by modulating the microglia is able to have potential therapeutic effects in neuro-inflammation conditions and microglia cells such as MS and AD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Since the role of macrophages in the MSC-mediated recovery of heart function after MI remains unclear, this question was thus addressed in the current study. We found that transplantation of MSCs did not alter the total number of the macrophages in the injured heart, but induced their polarization towards a -phenotype. Moreover, administration of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) into MSC-transplanted mice, which prevented -polarization of macrophages, abolished the effects of MSCs on recovery of heart function and on the reduction of infarcted cardiac tissue. Thus, our data suggest that MSCs may rejuvenate CMCs after ischemic injury at least partially through induction of -polarization of macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30424681>Immunization with plasmids encoding  acetylcholine muscarinic receptor epitopes impairs cardiac function in mice and induces autophagy in the myocardium.</a></h2><p>Autoantibodies against the  subtype of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors with functional activities have been found in the sera of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and the second extracellular loop has been established as the predominant epitope. However, it has been shown that the third intracellular loop is recognized by Chagas disease patients with severe cardiac dysfunction. In this work, BALB/c mice were immunized with plasmids encoding these two epitopes, and a control group received the empty plasmid (pcDNA3 vector). Serum from these DNA-immunized animals had elevated and persistent titres of antibodies against respective antigens. Heart echocardiography indicated diminished left ventricular wall thickness and reduced ejection fraction for both epitope-immunized groups, and ergospirometry tests showed a significant decrease in the exercise time and  consumption. Transfer of serum from these immunized mice into naïve recipients induced the same alterations in cardiac structure and function. Furthermore, electron microscopy analysis of donor-immunized animals revealed several ultrastructural alterations suggestive of autophagy and mitophagy, suggesting novel roles for these autoantibodies. Overall, greater functional and structural impairment was observed in the donor and recipient epitope groups, implicating the third intracellular loop epitope in the pathological effects for the first-time.

Despite such promising evidence, little is known about the potential mechanisms behind their anti-obesity effects. The aim of this study is to establish potential anti-obesity effects of the phytochemical guggulsterone (GS).  Mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with GS, derived from the guggul plant native in northern India, to investigate its effects on mitochondrial biogenesis and adipocyte "beiging." Further, to explore the relationship between macrophages and adipocytes, 3T3-L1s were treated with conditioned media from GS-treated RAW264.7 macrophages. Markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and beiging were measured by western blot.  GS treatment in adipocytes resulted in increased mitochondrial density, biogenesis (PGC1α and PPARγ), and increased markers of a beige adipocyte phenotype (UCP1, TBX1, and β-3AR). This upregulation in mitochondrial expression was accompanied by increases  consumption. In GS-treated macrophages, markers of  polarization were elevated (e.g., arginase and IL-10), along with increased catecholamine release into the media. Lastly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with conditioned media from macrophages induced a 167.8% increase in UCP1 expression, suggestive of a role of macrophages in eliciting an anti-adipogenic response to GS.  Results from this study provide the first mechanistic understanding of the anti-obesity effects of GS and suggests a role for both direct GS-signaling and indirect stimulation of  macrophage polarization in this model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31492342>Photocatalytic TiO₂ Nanoparticles Activated by Dielectric Barrier Discharge Plasma Assisted Ball Milling.</a></h2><p>Developing defects on the surface of TiO₂ nanoparticles by mechanical treatment is a fascinating approach to enhance photocatalytic efficiency. However, it poses risks to producing bulk defects and phase transformation, which seriously deteriorates photocatalytic performance. Here, activating TiO₂ nanoparticles was elaborately fulfilled by using dielectric barrier discharge plasma assisted ball milling (DBDP-milling) as it imposes plasma to nano-scaled particles along with soft mechanical impact. The evolution of surface properties of TiO₂ nanoparticles with DBDP-milling durations was inspected using a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), while the morphology and structure were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. Results showed that DBDP-milling developed a considerable number of  vacancies in TiO₂ nanoparticles as well as bulk defects free. These TiO₂ nanoparticles formed agglomerates with BET surface area of 37.40 /g and exhibited enhanced photocatalytic efficiency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30703127>Dose-response relationship between very vigorous physical activity and cardiovascular health assessed by heart rate variability in adults: Cross-sectional results from the EPIMOV study.</a></h2><p>The minimum amount of physical activity needed to obtain health benefits has been widely determined. Unlikely, the impact of extreme amounts of very vigorous physical activity (VVPA, ≥ 8 metabolic equivalents) to the heart remains controversial. We aimed to evaluate the dose-response relationship between VVPA and heart rate variability (HRV) in adults. We selected 1040 asymptomatic individuals (60% women, 42 ± 15 years, 28 ± 6 kg/) from the Epidemiology and Human Movement Study (EPIMOV). Participants remained in the supine position for 10 min, and we selected an intermediate 5-min window for HRV analysis. The standard deviation of the RR intervals, root mean square of RR intervals, successive RR intervals that differ > 50 ms, powers of the low-and high-frequency bands and Poincaré plot standard deviations were quantified. Participants used a triaxial accelerometer (Actigraph GT3x+) above the dominant hip for 4-7 consecutive days for quantifying their physical activity. We also evaluated the maximum  uptake ([Formula: see text]) during an exercise test. We stratified participants into five groups according to the VVPA in min/week (group 1, ≤ 1.50; 2, 1.51-3.16; 3, 3.17-3.54; 4, 3.55-20.75; and 5, > 20.75). The linear trends of the HRV through the quintiles of VVPA were investigated. We used logarithmic transformations to compare the five groups adjusted for age, sex, cardiovascular risk, and [Formula: see text]. We found a better HRV with increased VVPA for all HRV indices studied (p trend < 0.05). However, group 5 did not differ from group 4 (p > 0.05) for none of the indices. We conclude that there is an incremental benefit of VVPA on HRV of asymptomatic adults. Since we found neither additional benefits nor the harmful impact of amounts of VVPA as high as 22 min/week on HRV, our results should not discourage asymptomatic adults to perform VVPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31543862>The Role of Thyroid Hormones in Hepatocyte Proliferation and Liver Cancer.</a></h2><p>Thyroid hormones T3 and T4 (thyroxine) control a wide variety of effects related to development, differentiation, growth and metabolism, through their interaction with nuclear receptors. But thyroid hormones also produce non-genomic effects that typically start at the plasma membrane and are mediated mainly by integrin αvβ3, although other receptors such as TRα and TRβ are also able to elicit non-genomic responses. In the liver, the effects of thyroid hormones appear to be particularly important. The liver is able to regenerate, but it is subject to pathologies that may lead to cancer, such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In addition, cancer cells undergo a reprogramming of their metabolism, resulting in drastic changes such as aerobic glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation. As a consequence, the pyruvate kinase isoform , the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, is dysregulated, and this is considered an important factor in tumorigenesis. Redox equilibrium is also important, in fact cancer cells give rise to the production of more reactive  species (ROS) than normal cells. This increase may favor the survival and propagation of cancer cells. We evaluate the possible mechanisms involving the plasma membrane receptor integrin αvβ3 that may lead to cancer progression. Studying diseases that affect the liver and their experimental models may help to unravel the cellular pathways mediated by integrin αvβ3 that can lead to liver cancer. Inhibitors of integrin αvβ3 might represent a future therapeutic tool against liver cancer. We also include information on the possible role of exosomes in liver cancer, as well as on recent strategies such as organoids and spheroids, which may provide a new tool for research, drug discovery, and personalized medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208190>Dudleya brittonii extract promotes survival rate and -like metabolic change in porcine 3D4/31 alveolar macrophages.</a></h2><p>Although alveolar macrophages play a key role in the respiratory immunity of livestock, but studies on the mechanism of differentiation and survival of alveolar macrophages are lacking. Therefore, we undertook to investigate changes in the lipid metabolism and survival rate, using 3D4/31 macrophages and Dudleya brittonii which has been used as a traditional asthma treatment.3D4/31 macrophages were used as the in vitro porcine alveolar macrophages model. The cells were activated by exposure to Phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate (PMA). D. Brittonii extraction was performed with distilled water. For evaluating the cell survival rate, we performed the water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) cell viability assay and growth curve analysis. To confirm cell death, cell cycle and intracellular reactive  species levels were measured using flow cytometric analysis by applying fluorescence dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) and propidium iodide (PI). Furthermore, we also evaluated cellular lipid accumulation with Oil Red O staining, and fatty acid synthesis related genes expression levels using quantitative PCR (qPCR) with SYBR green dye. Glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle related gene expression levels were measured using qPCR after exposure to Dudleya brittonii extract (DB) for 12 h.Reactive  species (ROS) production and cell death were induced by PMA treatment, and exposure to DB reduced the PMA induced downregulation of cell survival. PMA and DB treatments upregulated the lipid accumulation, with corresponding increase in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACACA), fatty acid synthase (FASN) mRNA expressions. DB-PMA co-treatment reduced the glycolysis genes expression, but increased the expressions of fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle genes.This study provides new insights and directions for further researches relating to the immunity of porcine respiratory system, by employing a model based on alveolar macrophages and natural materials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29807362>Exosomes from MiR-30d-5p-ADSCs Reverse Acute Ischemic Stroke-Induced, Autophagy-Mediated Brain Injury by Promoting  Microglial/Macrophage Polarization.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have indicated that exosomes secreted from adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have important effects in the treatment of ischemic injury. However, the treatment mechanism is unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether ADSC-derived exosomes enriched with microRNA (miR)-30d-5p have a protective effect on acute ischemic stroke (AIS).In the current study, inflammatory factors and miR-30d-5p expression were assessed in 70 subjects with AIS and 35 healthy controls. Exosomes were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and further examined using nanoparticle tracking analyses. A rat model of AIS and an in vitro model of - and glucose-deprived (OGD) primary microglia were established to study the protective mechanism of exosomes from miR-30d-5p-overexpressing ADSCs in ischemia-induced nerve injury.The results showed that following AIS, the expression of inflammatory cytokines increased, while the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4, IL-10, and miR-30d-5p decreased both in patients and in animal models. Moreover, in vitro studies demonstrated that suppression of autophagy significantly reduced the OGD-induced inflammatory response. In addition, exosome treatment was more effective in suppressing the inflammatory response by reversing OGD-induced and autophagy-mediated microglial polarization to M1. Furthermore, in vivo studies showed that exosomes derived from ADSCs significantly decreased the cerebral injury area of infarction by suppressing autophagy and promoting  microglia/macrophage polarization.Our results suggest that miR-30d-5p-enhanced ADSC-derived exosomes prevent cerebral injury by inhibiting autophagy-mediated microglial polarization to M1.© 2018 The Author(s).

Mouse microglial BV2 cells were cultured to establish the cell model of cerebral ischemic stroke by -glucose deprivation (OGD). We observed highly expressed RMST, increased expression of M1, and decreased expression of  markers in BV2 microglial cells stimulated with OGD. These alterations were reversed by RMST knockdown. Activation of transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-mediated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway was observed upon OGD stimulation, which was promoted by RMST through competitively binding with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK), confirmed by RNA pull down and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. Furthermore, RMST overexpressing-BV2 cells effectively enhanced neuronal apoptosis. In conclusion, RMST promoted OGD-induced microglial M1 polarization by competitively interacting with hnRNPK via TAK1-mediated NF-κB pathway, which will provide a basis for understanding the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular diseases.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30334958>Modulation of macrophage polarization by level-1 Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test in young football players.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to examine the effect of the level-1 Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test (YYIRT1) on polarization of macrophages in young football players.Fourteen male football players (19.9 ± 1.4 years old) were enrolled in this study.

In excess, however, ROS can damage all three major classes of macromolecules and compromise cell viability. We briefly discuss the physiology of ROS but focus on the mechanisms cells use to preserve redox homeostasis upon oxidative stress, with particular emphasis on glycolysis. ROS inhibits multiple glycolytic enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase , and phosphofructokinase-1. Consistently, glycolytic inhibition promotes flux into the oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate pathway to generate NADPH. NADPH is critically important, as it provides the reducing power that fuels the protein-based antioxidant systems and recycles oxidized glutathione.

It is now emerging that neurohumoral mechanisms activated during heart failure, with both preserved and reduced ejection fraction, modulate cells of the immune system. Indeed, these cells express angiotensin I receptors, adrenoceptors, and natriuretic peptides receptors. Ang II modulates macrophage polarization, promoting  macrophages phenotype, and this stimulation can influence lymphocytes Th1/Th2 balance. β-AR activation in monocytes is responsible for inhibition of free  radicals production, and together with α2-AR can modulate TNF-α receptor expression and TNF-α release. In dendritic cells, activation of β2-AR inhibits IL-12 production, resulting in the inhibition of Th1 and promotion of Th2 differentiation. ANP induces the activation of secretion of superoxide anion in polymorphonucleated cells; reduces TNF-α and nitric oxide secretion in macrophages; and attenuates the exacerbated TH1 responses. BNP in macrophages can stimulate ROS production, up-regulates IL-10, and inhibits IL-12 and TNF-α release by dendritic cells, suggesting an anti-inflammatory cytokines profile induction. Therefore, different neurohormonal-immune cross-talks can determine the phenotype of cardiac remodeling, promoting either favorable or maladaptive responses. This review aims to summarize the available knowledge on neurohormonal modulation of immune responses, providing supportive rational background for further research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30649365>Increasing Iron Status through Dietary Supplementation in Iron-Depleted, Sedentary Women Increases Endurance Performance at Both Near-Maximal and Submaximal Exercise Intensities.</a></h2><p>Iron deficiency persists as the most common micronutrient deficiency globally, despite having known detrimental effects on physical performance. Although iron supplementation and aerobic exercise have been examined individually and are known to improve physical performance, the impact of simultaneous iron supplementation and aerobic training remains unclear.The aim of this study was to examine the individual and combined effects of iron supplementation and aerobic training on improving maximal and submaximal physical performance in iron-depleted, nonanemic (IDNA) women. We hypothesized that women receiving iron would improve their endurance performance but not their estimated maximal  consumption (eVO2max).Seventy-three sedentary, previously untrained IDNA (serum ferritin <25 µg/L and hemoglobin >110 g/L) women aged 18-26 y with a body mass index (kg/) of 17-25 participated in a double-blind, 8-wk, randomized controlled trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design including iron supplementation (42 mg elemental Fe/d) or placebo and aerobic exercise training (5 d/wk for 25 min at 75-85% of age-predicted maximum heart rate) or no training. Linear models were used to examine relations between training, supplement, and changes in the primary outcomes of observed maximal  consumption (VO2peak) and eVO2max and ventilatory threshold (absolute  consumption and percentage of maximum). Re-evaluation of a published meta-analysis was used to compare effects of iron supplementation on maximal  consumption (VO2max) and VO2peak.There were significant training-by-supplement interactions for VO2peak, volume of  consumption at the ventilatory threshold, and the percentage of eVO2max where the threshold occurred, with the iron-untrained group performing better than the placebo-untrained group. There was no beneficial effect of iron supplementation for VO2max (mean difference: 0.53; 95% CI: -0.75, 1.81; P = 0.42), but a significant benefit was observed for VO2peak (mean difference: 1.87; 95% CI: 0.15, 3.60; P = 0.03).Iron supplementation increases endurance performance at submaximal and maximal (VO2peak) exercise intensities in IDNA women.

Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) is critically involved in chromatin decondensation during the release of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) by activated neutrophils. Alternatively, activated macrophages () and accurate collagen deposition determine the repair of the infarcted heart. In this study, we investigated the impact of NETs on macrophage polarization and their role for acute cardiac inflammation and subsequent cardiac healing in a mouse model of acute MI. NETs were found to promote  macrophage polarization toward a reparative phenotype. NETs suppressed pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1) under hypoxia and diminished IL-6 and TNF-α expression. Further on, NETs strongly supported M2b polarization and IL-10 expression. In cardiac fibroblasts, NETs increased  expression under hypoxic culture conditions. PAD4 mice subjected to permanent ligation of the left anterior descending artery suffered from overwhelming inflammation in the acute phase of MI. Noteworthy, PAD4 neutrophils were unable to release NETs upon  stimulation with ionomycin or PMA, but produced significantly higher amounts of reactive  species (ROS). Increased levels of circulating cell-free DNA, mitochondrial DNA and cardiac troponin were found in PAD4 mice in the acute phase of MI when compared to WT mice. Reduced cardiac expression of , and  marker genes, as well as increased α expression, suggested a pro-inflammatory state. PAD4 mice displayed significantly increased cardiac  expression under baseline conditions. At day 1, post-MI, PAD4 mice showed increased end-diastolic volume and increased thinning of the left ventricular wall. Interestingly, improved cardiac function, as demonstrated by significantly increased ejection fraction, was found at day 21. Altogether, our results indicate that NETs support macrophage polarization toward an  phenotype, thus displaying anti-inflammatory properties. PAD4 deficiency aggravates acute inflammation and increases tissue damage post-MI, partially due to the lack of NETs.Copyright © 2019 Eghbalzadeh, Georgi, Louis, Zhao, Keser, Weber, Mollenhauer, Conforti, Wahlers and Paunel-Görgülü.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30441742>Improving the Diagnostic Ability of Oximetry Recordings in Pediatric Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome by Means of Multi-Class AdaBoost.</a></h2><p>Pediatric sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) is a highly prevalent respiratory disorder that may impose many negative effects on the health and development of children. Due to the drawbacks of overnight polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard diagnosis technique, automated analysis of nocturnal oximetry has emerged as a simplified alternative. In order to improve diagnosis ability of oximetry, we propose to evaluate the usefulness of AdaBoost, a classification boosting algorithm, in the context of pediatric SAHS. A database composed of 981 SpO recordings from pediatric subjects was used. For this purpose, a signal processing approach divided into two main stages was conducted: (i) feature extraction, where 3%  desaturation index (ODI3), spectral, and nonlinear features were computed from the oximetry signal, and (ii) AdaBoost classification, where an AdaBoost. model was trained with these features in order to determine the severity of pediatric SAHS according to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): AHI<1 events per hour (e/h), 1≤AHI<5 e/h, and AHI≥5 e/h. Our AdaBoost. model achieved a Cohen's kappa of 0.474 in an independent test set in the 3-class classification task. In addition, high accuracies were obtained when using the AHI cutoffs for diagnosis of mild (AHI=1 e/h) and moderate-to-severe (AHI=5 e/h) SAHS: 80.9% and 82.9%, respectively. These results achieved slightly higher diagnostic accuracies than ODI3 as well as state-of-the-art studies. Therefore, AdaBoost could help to enhance the diagnostic ability of the oximetry signal to assess pediatric SAHS severity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30682016>Cell type-specific differences in redox regulation and proliferation after low UVA doses.</a></h2><p>Ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation is harmful for living organisms but in low doses may stimulate cell proliferation. Our aim was to examine the relationships between exposure to different low UVA doses, cellular proliferation, and changes in cellular reactive  species levels. In human colon cancer (HCT116) and melanoma (Me45) cells exposed to UVA doses comparable to environmental, the highest doses (30-50 kJ/) reduced clonogenic potential but some lower doses (1 and 10 kJ/) induced proliferation. This effect was cell type and dose specific. In both cell lines the levels of reactive  species and nitric oxide fluctuated with dynamics which were influenced differently by UVA; in Me45 cells decreased proliferation accompanied the changes in the dynamics of H2O2 while in HCT116 cells those of superoxide. Genes coding for proteins engaged in redox systems were expressed differently in each cell line; transcripts for thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin and glutathione peroxidase showed higher expression in HCT116 cells whereas those for glutathione transferases and copper chaperone were more abundant in Me45 cells. We conclude that these two cell types utilize different pathways for regulating their redox status. Many mechanisms engaged in maintaining cellular redox balance have been described. Here we show that the different cellular responses to a stimulus such as a specific dose of UVA may be consequences of the use of different redox control pathways. Assays of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide level changes after exposure to UVA may clarify mechanisms of cellular redox regulation and help in understanding responses to stressing factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29969718>IRE1α aggravates ischemia reperfusion injury of fatty liver by regulating phenotypic transformation of kupffer cells.</a></h2><p>Fatty liver is one of the widely accepted marginal donor for liver transplantation, but is also more sensitive to ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) and produces more reactive  species (ROS). Moreover, so far, no effective method has been developed to alleviate it. Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER-stress) of hepatocyte is associated with the occurrence of fatty liver disease, but ER-stress of kupffer cells (KCs) in fatty liver is not clear at all. This study evaluates whether ER-stress of KCs is activated in fatty liver and accelerate IRI of fatty livers. ER-stress of KCs was activated in fatty liver, especially the IRE1α signal pathway. KCs with activated ER-stress secreted more proinflammatory cytokine to induce its M1-phenotypic shift in fatty liver, resulting in more severe IRI. Also, activated ER-stress of BMDMs in vitro by tunicamycin can induce its pro-inflammatory shift and can be reduced by 4-PBA, an ER-stress inhibitor. Knockdown of IRE1α could regulate the STAT1 and STAT6 pathway of macrophage to inhibit the M1-type polarization and promote -phenotypic shift. Furthermore, transfusion of IRE1α-knockdown KCs significantly reduced the liver IRI as well as the ROS of HFD feeding mice. Altogether, these data demonstrated that IRE1α of KCs may be a potential target to reduce the fatty liver associated IRI in liver transplantation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice. A 14-year-old African American female presented with fatigue, easy bruising, and fever. On examination, she had scattered bruising, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory evaluation revealed pancytopenia with peripheral blasts, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML; French-American-British , t[8;21][q22;q22.1]) was diagnosed on bone marrow biopsy. A baseline echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function (ejection fraction [EF], 60%; shortening fraction [SF], 32%), and conventional chemotherapy was initiated that consisted of two cycles of remission induction (cytarabine, etoposide, and daunorubicin [50 mg/m × 3 days per cycle]) followed by intensification 1 (high-dose cytarabine and etoposide), intensification 2 (high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone [12 mg/m/dose daily; four total doses]), and intensification 3 (high-dose cytarabine and l-asparaginase). Of note, an echocardiogram was not repeated before the start of intensification 1. During intensification 1, the patient developed Streptococcus viridans sepsis, which required 4 days in the intensive care unit with antimicrobial and inotropic support. Repeat echocardiogram after recovery from the sepsis episode demonstrated low-normal LV systolic function (EF, 53%; SF, 27%), and she subsequently began intensification 2. On day 3 of intensification 2, the patient developed afebrile tachypnea, tachycardia, and an increasing  requirement. Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion. Cardiac troponins were normal, whereas N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide was 10 times the upper limit of normal. Repeat echocardiogram showed an enlarged LV with moderate to severely depressed LV function (EF, 28%; SF, 14%). Day 4 mitoxantrone was omitted and a cardiology consult obtained.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30070144>The Role of Metabolic Remodeling in Macrophage Polarization and Its Effect on Skeletal Muscle Regeneration.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are crucial for tissue homeostasis. Based on their activation, they might display classical/M1 or alternative/ phenotypes. M1 macrophages produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive  species (ROS), and nitric oxide (NO).  macrophages upregulate arginase-1 and reduce NO and ROS levels; they also release anti-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and polyamines, thus promoting angiogenesis and tissue healing. Moreover, M1 and  display key metabolic differences; M1 polarization is characterized by an enhancement in glycolysis and in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) along with a decreased oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), whereas  are characterized by an efficient OxPhos and reduced PPP. Recent Advances: The glutamine-related metabolism has been discovered as crucial for  polarization. Vice versa, flux discontinuities in the Krebs cycle are considered additional M1 features; they lead to increased levels of immunoresponsive gene 1 and itaconic acid, to isocitrate dehydrogenase 1-downregulation and to succinate, citrate, and isocitrate over-expression.A macrophage classification problem, particularly in vivo, originating from a gap in the knowledge of the several intermediate polarization statuses between the M1 and  extremes, characterizes this field. Moreover, the detailed features of metabolic reprogramming crucial for macrophage polarization are largely unknown; in particular, the role of β-oxidation is highly controversial.Manipulating the metabolism to redirect macrophage polarization might be useful in various pathologies, including an efficient skeletal muscle regeneration. Unraveling the complexity pertaining to metabolic signatures that are specific for the different macrophage subsets is crucial for identifying new compounds that are able to trigger macrophage polarization and that might be used for therapeutical purposes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649847>Kinsenoside attenuates osteoarthritis by repolarizing macrophages through inactivating NF-B/MAPK signaling and protecting chondrocytes.</a></h2><p>The objective was to investigate the effect of kinsenoside (Kin) treatments on macrophage polarity and evaluate the resulting protection of chondrocytes to attenuate osteoarthritis (OA) progression. RAW264.7 macrophages were polarized to M1/ subtypes then administered with different concentrations of Kin. The polarization transitions were evaluated with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), confocal observation and flow cytometry analysis. The mechanism of Kin repolarizing M1 macrophages was evaluated by Western blot. Further, macrophage conditioned medium (CM) and IL-1 were administered to chondrocytes. Micro-CT scanning and histological observations were conducted  on anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) mice with or without Kin treatment. We found that Kin repolarized M1 macrophages to the  phenotype. Mechanistically, Kin inhibited the phosphorylation of IB, which further reduced the downstream phosphorylation of P65 in nuclear factor-B (NF-B) signaling. Moreover, Kin inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling molecules p-JNK, p-ERK and p-P38. Additionally, Kin attenuated macrophage CM and IL-1-induced chondrocyte damage. , Kin reduced the infiltration of M1 macrophages, promoted  macrophages in the synovium, inhibited subchondral bone destruction and reduced articular cartilage damage induced by ACLT. All the results indicated that Kin is an effective therapeutic candidate for OA treatment.© 2019 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

In this study, we found that PKM2 was highly expressed in patients with ulcerative colitis or colorectal cancer (CRC). We then investigated the effectiveness of conditionally ablating PKM2 in Lgr5 intestinal stem cells (ISC) using a mouse model of colitis-associated CRC (AOM plus DSS). Tamoxifen-inducible Lgr5-driven deletion of PKM2 in ISC (PKM2-Tx) significantly promoted tumor incidence and size in the colon and lower body weight compared with findings in vehicle-treated mice (PKM2-Veh). Histopathologic analysis revealed considerable high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma in the colon of PKM2-Tx mice while PKM2-Veh mice had low- and high-grade dysplasia. Loss of PKM2 was associated with dominant expression of PKM1 in Lgr5 ISC and their progeny cells. Further, the organoid-forming efficiency of whole cancer cells or Lgr5 cells obtained from colon polyps of PKM2-Tx mice was significantly increased when compared with PKM2-Veh mice. Cancer organoids from PKM2-Tx mice exhibited increased mitochondrial  consumption and a shift of metabolites involved in energy metabolism. These findings suggest that loss of PKM2 function in ISC promotes colitis-associated CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30096402>Antiglioma via regulating oxidative stress and remodeling tumor-associated macrophage using lactoferrin-mediated biomimetic codelivery of simvastatin/fenretinide.</a></h2><p>Effective treatment of malignant glioma still remains a formidable challenge due to lack of the effective BBB-permeable drugs and efficient brain delivery methods, and the pharmacotherapy options are very limited. Therefore, to develop an effective therapeutic strategy is a pressing need. In this work, a noncytotoxic drug combination (i.e., simvastatin and fenretinide) was revealed to be potent for treating glioma, which was co-encapsulated into a TPGS-TAT-embedded lactoferrin nanoparticle system for achieving brain-targeted biomimetic delivery via the LRP-1 receptor. It was shown that the lactoferrin nanoparticle repolarized the tumor-associated macrophages from the  phenotype to M1 via regulating the STAT6 pathway, as well as induced the ROS-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis by inhibiting the Ras/Raf/p-Erk pathway in the glioma cells. The antiglioma efficacy was further demonstrated in both the subcutaneous and orthotopic glioma models. The repolarization of tumor-associated macrophages not only prompted the ROS generation but also induced the innate immunity (e.g., antitumor cytokine release). This delivery and therapeutic strategy provides a novel modality for the glioma treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

MAPO was determined by linear extrapolation of the theoretical maximum heart rate.Among men, MAPO values were 234.9 ± 48.4 w for body mass index (BMI) values between 30 and 34.9 kg/, 235.1 ± 69.7 w for BMI between 35 and 39.9 kg/, 270.2 ± 86.5 w for BMI over 40 kg/. MAPO relative values were 2.27 ± 0.5, 2.16 ± 0.6 and 1.96 ± 0.8 w/kg, respectively. Among women, MAPO was 172.6 ± 36.1 w for a BMI < 30 kg/, 169.2 ± 39.4 w for BMI between 30 and 34.9 kg/, 179.5 ± 48.8 w f179.5 ± 48.8 w for BMI between 35 and 39.9 kg/ and 202.3 ± 57.3 w for BMI of 40 kg/ or over.

We used high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and surface marker co-expression to develop a high-throughput flow cytometry-based assay to quantify circulating proangiogenic and proinflammatory cell content in the peripheral blood of individuals with T2D. Circulating proangiogenic monocytes expressing anti-inflammatory  markers were decreased in patients with T2D. Individuals with longer duration of T2D exhibited reduced frequencies of circulating proangiogenic ALDHCD34+ progenitor cells with primitive (CD133) and migratory (CXCR4) phenotypes.

The goal of the study was to determine if sexual activity the evening before several physical performance tests affected the results compared to the same performance tests after five days of abstinence.Ten, monogamous, married young men (28±7 years old, body mass index = 25.5±2.7 kg/) underwent a six-physical performance/balance/agility tests (forearm grip strength, balance, lateral movement, reaction time, anaerobic power, and maximal  uptake) on three different days. The first day was a familiarization session, where the subjects familiarized themselves with the performance tests. Then, two randomized, single-blind mornings sessions occurred there was either no sexual intercourse on the five days prior to the tests (control condition) or sexual intercourse on the night before the tests (experimental condition) in a randomized counterbalanced, fashion. The six performance tests were performed in the same order for each of the three sessions. A paired-t-test was used to compare each fitness test between conditions.The results showed that sexual activity had no effect on any of the six physical performance tests.This suggests that physical performance is unaffected by sexual activity within 24 hours prior to competition in young men.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31251971>2,3'4,4',5-Pentachlorobiphenyl induces hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation through pyruvate kinase -dependent glycolysis.</a></h2><p>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are classic persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and are associated with the progression of many cancers, including liver cancer. The present study investigated the effect of 2,3'4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB118) on hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and its underlying mechanisms. The results indicated that PCB118 exposure promotes the proliferation and glycolysis of hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells. Moreover, PCB118 exposure increased the expression level of pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) and its nuclear translocation, whereas treatment with PKM2 shRNA suppressed the induction of cell proliferation and glycolysis by PCB118. PCB118 stimulated reactive  species (ROS) production by activating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. Treatment with the antioxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) prevented PCB118-induced effects on PKM2, cell proliferation and glycolysis. Furthermore, we found that PCB118 activated NADPH oxidase through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in SMMC-7721 cells. Consistently, treatment with AhR shRNA suppressed PCB118-induced effects on PKM2, cell proliferation and glycolysis. Overall, these results indicated that PCB118 promotes HCC cell proliferation via PKM2-dependent upregulation of glycolysis, which is mediated by AhR/NADPH oxidase-induced ROS production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the benefit of those therapies, the induction of side effects is acommon consequence affecting psychosocial and physiological outcomes. This quasi-experimental study compared physical fitness in recent-term (14-30 months; n= 11) and later-term (74-92 months; n= 8) BCD patients. After inclusion, recent-term BCD patients were engaged in asupervised exercise program and was explored its impact on physical fitness, health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) and fatigue. At baseline (M1) and after 8 () and 16 weeks (M3) of this period, HR-QOL and fatigue were evaluated by the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire and physical fitness through the estimation of maximum  consumption (VO2max,ml.kg.min-1), handgrip force (kg) and sit-stand test. At baseline, women with later-term BCD have revealed better VO2max (p < 0.05) than recent-term BCD patients. There was asignificant time*group interaction for physical fitness outcomes and only the patients who have participated in the exercise program reported significant changes between baseline and at 16 weeks.

First, continuous exercise (CEx) on an ergometer for 30 minutes at 60% of maximal  consumption (VO2max) and interval exercise (IEx) at 80% VO2max for 2 minutes were performed. This was followed by exercise performed at 40% VO2max for 1 minute and at 80% VO2max for 3 minutes, performed 6 times repeatedly for a total of 26 minutes. The accumulation of short duration exercise (AEx) was performed for 3-bouts of 10 minutes each at 60% VO2max.The major findings were as follows: energy consumption during the exercises showed no significant difference between CEx, IEx, and AEx; EPOC was higher in IEx and AEx as compared to CEx for all dependent variables (e.g. total  consumption, total calorie, summation of heart rate, and EPOC duration); and the lipid profile showed no significant difference.Our study confirmed that when homogenizing the energy expenditure for various exercises in NWO individuals, EPOC was higher in IEx and AEx than in CEx. Therefore, IEx and AEx can be considered as effective exercise methods for increasing energy expenditure in NWO females.©2019 The Korean Society for Exercise Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30740395>Biventricular Increases in Mitochondrial Fission Mediator (MiD51) and Proglycolytic Pyruvate Kinase (PKM2) Isoform in Experimental Group 2 Pulmonary Hypertension-Novel Mitochondrial Abnormalities.</a></h2><p> Group 2 pulmonary hypertension (PH), defined as a mean pulmonary arterial pressure ≥25 mmHg with elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure >15 mmHg, has no approved therapy and patients often die from right ventricular failure (RVF). Alterations in mitochondrial metabolism, notably impaired glucose oxidation, and increased mitochondrial fission, contribute to right ventricle (RV) dysfunction in PH. We hypothesized that the impairment of RV and left ventricular (LV) function in group 2 PH results in part from a proglycolytic isoform switch from pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoform 1 to 2 and from increased mitochondrial fission, due either to upregulation of expression of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) or its binding partners, mitochondrial dynamics protein of 49 or 51 kDa (MiD49 or 51).  Group 2 PH was induced by supra-coronary aortic banding (SAB) in 5-week old male Sprague Dawley rats. Four weeks post SAB, echocardiography showed marked reduction of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (2.9 ± 0.1 vs. 4.0 ± 0.1 mm) and pulmonary artery acceleration time (24.3 ± 0.9 vs. 35.4 ± 1.8 ms) in SAB vs. sham rats. Nine weeks post SAB, left and right heart catheterization showed significant biventricular increases in end systolic and diastolic pressure in SAB vs. sham rats (LV: 226 ± 15 vs. 103 ± 5 mmHg, 34 ± 5 vs. 7 ± 1 mmHg; RV: 40 ± 4 vs. 22 ± 1 mmHg, and 4.7 ± 1.5 vs. 0.9 ± 0.5 mmHg, respectively). Picrosirius red staining showed marked biventricular fibrosis in SAB rats. There was increased muscularization of small pulmonary arteries in SAB rats. Confocal microscopy showed biventricular mitochondrial depolarization and fragmentation in SAB vs. sham cardiomyocytes. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed a marked biventricular reduction in mitochondria size in SAB hearts. Immunoblot showed marked biventricular increase in PKM2/PKM1 and MiD51 expression. Mitofusin 2 and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 were increased in SAB LVs.  SAB caused group 2 PH. Impaired RV function and RV fibrosis were associated with increases in mitochondrial fission and expression of MiD51 and PKM2. While these changes would be expected to promote increased production of reactive  species and a glycolytic shift in metabolism, further study is required to determine the functional consequences of these newly described mitochondrial abnormalities.</p></html>
