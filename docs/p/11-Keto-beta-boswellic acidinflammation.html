Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potent inflammogen which causes cognitive dysfunction. Boswellia serrata is known since many years as a powerful anti-inflammatory herbal drug. Its beneficial effect mainly arises from inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) enzyme. 3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is the most potent 5-LO inhibitor extracted from the oleo-gum-resin of Boswellia serrata. The aim of the present work is to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of AKBA and dexamethasone (DEX) in LPS-induced neuroinflammatory model. A single intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose of LPS (0.8 mg/kg) was injected to induce cognitive dysfunction. The LPS-treated mice were administered for 7 days with either AKBA or DEX at intraperitoneal doses of 5 and 1 mg/kg, respectively. Cognitive, locomotor functions, and anxiety level were first examined. The level of the phosphorylated inhibitory protein for NF-κB, IκB-α (P-IκB-α), was measured, and the expression levels of the inflammatory microRNA-155 (miR-155) and its target gene, suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1), were determined in the brain. Moreover, the level of carbonyl proteins as a measure of oxidative stress and several cytokines as well as markers for apoptosis and amyloidogenesis was detected. Results showed that AKBA and DEX reversed the behavioral dysfunction induced by LPS. AKBA decreased P-IκB-α, miRNA-155 expression level, and carbonyl protein content. It restored normal cytokine level and increased SOCS-1 expression level. It also showed anti-apoptotic and anti-amyloidogenic effects in LPS-injected mice. These findings suggest AKBA as a therapeutic drug for alleviating the symptoms of neuroinflammatory disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29157812>The major Boswellia serrata active 3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid strengthens interleukin-1α upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 via JNK MAP kinase activation.</a></h1><p>Boswellia serrata gum resin has attracted pharmacological interest as an alternative antinflammatory.We studied the application of an ethanolic extract of the resin and its main active 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) against inflammatory degeneration of skin extracellular matrix.We compared the effects of the extract and AKBA on the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 (72-kDa and 92-kDa type IV collagenases) in HaCaT keratinocytes exposed to interleukin-1α (IL-1α) as a skin inflammation model.MMP activity in cell conditioned medium was assayed by gelatin zymography, while NF-kB and MAP kinase activations were evaluated by Western blotting.IL-1α (10 ng/ml) upregulated MMP-9 but not MMP-2 in HaCaT cells. The extract, used at 2.3, 4.6 and 9.3 µg/ml, had no effect, but in combination with IL-1α showed MMP-9 inhibition at the lowest dose and increased upregulation at the highest one. AKBA alone, at the same concentrations (corresponding to 5, 10, and 20 µM), did not stimulate MMP-9, but together with IL-1α induced an increased upregulation at the lowest dose that progressively disappeared at higher doses. WB analysis showed that IL-1α induced phosphorylation of NF-κB p65, while AKBA abolished this effect at 20 µM, but conversely increased it at 5 µM. Screening of MAP kinase phosphorylation showed a combined activation of IL-1α/AKBA on JNK, while the JNK inhibitor SP600125 abolished MMP-9 upregulation induced by IL-1α/AKBA.The enhancing effect of IL-1α/AKBA on MMP-9 at low AKBA concentration seems to involve the activation of JNK-mediated NF-κB pathway. Conversely, the extract inhibits the IL-1α effect at low doses, but not at higher ones, where AKBA and possibly other β-boswellic acids reach concentrations that potentiate the effect of IL-1α. The extract at low doses could protect the skin against degenerative processes of extracellular matrix, while keto-β-boswellic acids seem unsuitable for this purpose.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Using a simple and reliable reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the amount of 3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) in the BSE was found to be 18.5% w/w. The results confirmed that BSE and AKBA, at concentrations as high as 100 μg/mL or 10 μM, respectively, caused no significant cytotoxicity or apoptotic cell death. Co- and pretreatment with BSE (25-100 μg/mL) or AKBA (5 μM) restored the viability of PC12 and N2a cells under glutamate toxicity (8 mM). Treatment with BSE and AKBA also attenuated the toxic effects of glutamate on intracellular reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase activity, and oxidative DNA damage compared with the untreated glutamate-injured cells. Furthermore, BSE and AKBA decreased the apoptotic cell population in the sub-G1 region and the rate of both early and late-stage apoptosis induced by glutamate in the cells. Our data suggest that the protective effects of Boswellia extract and AKBA against glutamate toxicity in PC12 and N2a cells may be mediated through the amelioration of the oxidative stress and the resultant apoptosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27980494>In Vivo Osteoinduction: Evaluating 2-Beta Coxatene as an Immunoinductive Compound and Novel Ingredient for Joint Support.</a></h1><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by progressive loss of articular cartilage. Many treatments lack the ability to stimulate the growth of native cartilage tissue while they simultaneously increase joint comfort. For the past few decades, dietary supplements have been investigated for the ability to both address joint inflammation and stimulate cartilage tissue.The present study intended to examine the supplement's in vivo osteoinductive capabilities and clinical efficacy for overall joint health.The research team designed a randomized, double-blind, comparative clinical trial.The study took place via telephone interviews.Participants had self-reported OA of a weight-bearing joint (ie, of the knee, hip, spine, or ankle). Patients were recruited using the Health Science Institute, a consumer supplement newsletter.Participants in the intervention group were blindly given 135 mg of 2-Beta Coxatene (2BCT) orally, which contained (1) a custom blend of low-dose Cyplexinol, an osteoinductive protein complex derived from bovine bone tissue, and (2)  resin enriched to 65% 3--Acetyl-11-keto-β-Boswellic acid. A positive control group was blindly given 1500 mg of glucosamine hydrogen chloride and 1200 mg of chondroitin sulfate. Participants took the supplements for 3 mo.A histological evaluation was performed on an athymic rat to test the supplement's in vivo osteoinductive capabilities. A negative control, commercially purchased, unhydrolyzed type 2 collagen was used for that test. Participants were evaluated for parameters of pain and joint function at baseline (day 0) and at days 7, 30, and 90 using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) OA index and a visual analogue scale (VAS).The histological evaluation of the athymic rat confirmed that the Cyplexinol component of the 2BCT was positive for de novo bone tissue and collagen synthesis, corroborating osteoinduction. In the clinical trial, the intervention group reported significant decreases of 57.4%, 52.5%, and 58% in normalized WOMAC scores for pain, stiffness, and joint functionality, respectively, from baseline to postintervention. The control group reported a decrease of 17.5%, 18.1%, and 23.9% for pain, stiffness, and joint functionality, respectively. For the intervention group, pain intensity and frequency, as measured by the VAS, also decreased 57.1% and 56.3%, respectively, from baseline to postintervention, whereas the control group showed a decrease in VAS scores of 18.0% and 14.8%, respectively. In total, an average of 81.2% of participants administered the 2BCT had reported a statistically significant improvement from baseline to postintervention, compared with 22.9% of participants administered glucosamine and chondroitin.In vivo studies confirmed that the bioactive proteins (Cyplexinol) within the 2BCT stimulated de novo bone and cartilage tissue production, demonstrating osteoinduction. The intervention group reported greater improvements in the psychometric evaluations that assessed joint comfort when compared with participants given the glucosamine and chondroitin. The results suggest that 2BCT may provide a novel and synergistic response to preserving joint homeostasis and improving quality of life.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26984336>Co-administration of 3-Acetyl- Potentiates the Protective Effect of Celecoxib in Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Cognitive Impairment in Mice: Possible Implication of Anti-inflammatory and Antiglutamatergic Pathways.</a></h1><p>Neuro- is known to initiate the underlying pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders which may progress to cognitive, behavioral, and functional impairment. Boswellia serrata is a well-known powerful anti-inflammatory agent used to treat several inflammatory diseases. The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of the combination therapy of 3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), a 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitor and celecoxib, and a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor as dual enzyme inhibitors compared to monotherapies with celecoxib and AKBA. Cognitive dysfunction is induced by intraperational injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice. Radial maze, Y maze, and novel object recognition (NOR) were performed to evaluate the possible behavioral changes. Moreover, estimation of glutamate and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), as well as an immunohistochemical investigation of amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) was performed to evaluate the molecular changes that followed the LPS or drug treatment. The results showed that the combination therapy of AKBA and celecoxib reversed the behavioral and molecular changes caused by LPS cognitive dysfunction model that predispose cognitive dysfunction in mice. This study showed the effectiveness of the dual therapy with AKBA and celecoxib as anti-inflammatory, antiglutamatergic, and anti-amyloidogenic agents in the management of cognitive dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28759942>11-Keto-β-Boswellic Acid Inhibits Lymphocyte (CD3) Infiltration Into Pancreatic Islets of Young None Obese Diabetic (NOD) Mice.</a></h1><p>11-Keto-β-Boswellic acid (KBA) has been shown to prevent infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and appearance of peri-insular apoptotic cells in an animal model of autoimmune  caused by injection of Multiple Low Doses of Streptozotocin (MLD-STZ), which is a chemical compound belonging to the class of nitrososureas. The aim of this work was to study whether or not KBA can also prevent/attenuate infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and appearance of peri-insular apoptotic cells in an animal model of autoimmune  caused by genetic dysfunction resembling human type 1  in several important features. Four weeks old female NOD mice received daily i.p. injections of 7.5 mg/kg of KBA over a period of 3 weeks. Compared to 4 weeks old animals there was significant infiltration of lymphocytes (CD3) into pancreatic islets and appearance of peri-insular apoptotic cells in the period between 4 and 7 weeks. During this time plasma glucose dropped significantly and body weight did not increase. As far as pro-inflammatory cytokines are concerned, except a small increase of IFN-γ, there was no change in the blood. In mice that had been treated with KBA between 4 and 7 weeks after birth no significant infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and appearance of peri-insular apoptotic cells was observed, when compared to 4 weeks old mice. Moreover, there was no drop of blood glucose and the animals gained body weight. It is concluded that - similar to the model of MLD-STZ- - also in the NOD mouse model KBA is able to attenuate or even prevent development of insulitis, suggesting that KBA protects islets from autoimmune reaction regardless whether the signal is provided by a chemical compound or by genetic dysfunction. Whether this also holds for human type 1  remains to be established.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25895614>Boswellia carterii liquisolid systems with promoted anti- activity.</a></h1><p><i>Boswellia carterii</i> (BC) Birdwood oleogum resin is an ancient remedy of inflammation processes known since Ancient Egyptian time. Of boswellic acids, 3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is the most potent anti- active principle. Liquisolid systems of the biologically active fraction of BC oleogum resin were prepared for improving dissolution properties using low dose oral delivery to achieve enhanced anti- activity, in comparison with the standard oral anti-; Indomethacin. AKBA was assayed, employing an accurate and sensitive HPLC method. Detection was carried out at 210 nm using UV/Vis detector. A solubility study for the bioactive fraction was conducted. Microcrystalline cellulose and Aeroperl®300 Pharma were used as carrier and coating materials. Angle of slide, liquid load factor and Carr's flow index were estimated. Six systems were prepared using polyethylene glycol 400, solvent and two drug loading concentrations; 20 and 40 %. For each concentration, three carrier: coat ratios were dispensed; 20:1, 10:1, and 5:1. Dissolution study was performed and two systems were selected for characterization and in vivo evaluation by investigating upper GIT ulcerogenic effect and anti- efficacy in rats. Results indicate absence of ulcers and significantly higher and prolonged anti- efficacy for formulations F1 and F2, with carrier: coat ratio, 5:1 and drug loads of 20 and 40 %, respectively, compared with standard oral indomethacin. We conclude higher efficacy of BC bioactive fraction liquisolids compared with Indomethacin with greater safety on GIT, longer duration of action and hence better patient compliance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515728>Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) Attenuates Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, Complement Activation and Cell Death in Brain Endothelial Cells Following OGD/Reperfusion.</a></h1><p>Brain endothelial cells play an important role in maintaining blood flow homeostasis in the brain. Cerebral ischemia is a major cause of endothelial dysfunction which can disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)/reperfusion promote cell death and BBB breakdown in brain endothelial cells. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), a biologically active phytoconstituent of the medicinal plant Boswellia serrata, has been shown to be protective against various inflammatory diseases as well as ischemic brain injury. The molecular mechanisms underlying these beneficial characteristics of AKBA are poorly understood. We subjected bEND.3 cells to OGD/reperfusion to investigate the protective role of AKBA in this model. We found that AKBA treatment attenuated endothelial cell death and oxidative stress assessed by means of TUNEL assay, cleaved-caspase-3, and dihydroethidium (DHE) staining. Furthermore, OGD downregulated  proteins ZO-1 and Occludin levels, and increased the expressions of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, ICAM-1, and complement C3a receptor (C3aR). We also noticed the increased phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 in bEND.3 cells in OGD group. AKBA treatment significantly attenuated expression levels of these inflammatory proteins and prevented the degradation of ZO-1 and Occludin following OGD. In conclusion, AKBA treatment provides protection against endothelial cell dysfunction following OGD by attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593921>Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid derivatives effects on 5-lipoxygenase: In silico viewpoint.</a></h1><p>The 5-lipoxygenase enzyme is a proinflammatory enzyme and produces leukotrienes. Evidence has shown that  contributes to Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, boswellic acid derivatives have also been shown to be involved in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, the interaction of four different derivatives of boswellic acid with 5-lipoxygenase enzyme was investigated using molecular dynamics simulation. The simulation of the enzyme was also carried out alone. Calculation of Cα-RMSD indicates that the enzyme stability is slightly affected by boswellic acid derivatives. Calculating the radius of gyration of the enzyme also shows that the overall shape of the protein is not affected by ligands. The RMSF values of the enzyme residues were calculated in the presence of boswellic acid derivatives and it was compared with that in the absence of ligands. The results show that the flexibility of the enzyme residues is influenced by ligands. The residues, whose flexibility is reduced, are scattered throughout the enzyme. However, their number is great in the N-terminal residue. The binding affinity between boswellic acid derivatives and the enzyme residues was calculated using the measure of conformation factor. The results show that the residues interacting with ligands are in the area of the first domain of enzyme. The results obtained from molecular dynamics simulation are well-consistent with the experimental evidence related to the inhibitory effect of the mentioned compounds with 5-lipoxygenase.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) on activated dendritic cells (DCs) using an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced -like mouse model and murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) stimulated with resiquimod (R848) in vitro.The mice were treated with IMQ and intragastrically administered 25-100 mg/kg/day of AKBA, 1 mg/kg/day of methotrexate (MTX), or normal saline. The inflammation of skin lesions in IMQ mice were evaluated by  area and severity index (PASI) and pathological staining. The related proteins of Toll-like receptor (TLR)7/8 pathways were assessed using Western blotting, and the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-12p40 mRNA using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The numbers of DCs and marker-positive BMDCs were assessed using flow cytometry and the levels of inflammatory factors using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.AKBA and MTX obviously improved the -like skin lesions of IMQ-treated mice. AKBA also obviously decreased the PASI score, reduced the thickness of epidermis, ameliorated the infiltration of CD3+ and CD11c+ cells in skin lesions, decreased the activation of local DCs, inhibited the mRNA expression and secretion of inflammatory factors IL-12 and IL-23, inhibited the maturation and differentiation of DCs to promote T-cell differentiation, and inhibited the activation of TLR7/8 and IRF signaling pathways.This study implied that AKBA might have an anti-inflammatory effect on  by inhibiting the maturation and activation of DCs via the TLR8 and IRF signaling pathways.Copyright © 2018.

Small molecules able to interact with LL-37 and to modulate its functions have not been described yet. Boswellic acids (BAs) are pentacyclic triterpene acids that are bioactive principles of frankincense extracts used as anti-inflammatory remedies. Although various anti-inflammatory modes of action have been proposed for BAs, the pharmacological profile of these compounds is still incompletely understood. Here, we describe the identification of human LL-37 as functional target of BAs. In unbiased target fishing experiments using immobilized BAs as bait and human neutrophils as target source, LL-37 was identified as binding partner assisted by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Thermal stability experiments using circular dichroism spectroscopy confirm direct interaction between BAs and LL-37. Of interest, this binding of BAs resulted in an inhibition of the functionality of LL-37. Thus, the LPS-neutralizing properties of isolated LL-37 were inhibited by 3-O-acetyl-β-BA (Aβ-BA) and 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-BA (AKβ-BA) in a cell-free limulus amoebocyte lysate assay with EC50=0.2 and 0.8 μM, respectively. Also, LL-37 activity was inhibited by these BAs in LL-37-enriched supernatants of stimulated neutrophils or human plasma derived from stimulated human whole blood. Together, we reveal BAs as inhibitors of LL-37, which might be a relevant mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory properties of BAs and suggests BAs as suitable chemical tools or potential agents for intervention with LL-37 and related disorders.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Radiation effects on cell morphology, cell viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and antioxidant enzymes were examined.AKBA reduces UVA irradiation-induced cell viability loss, accompanied by a decreased production of UVA-induced ROS, decreased malondialdehyde, and increased superoxide dismutase expression. In addition, AKBA increased basal and UVA-induced levels of Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2), the redox-sensitive factor, and its target genes NQO1 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), whereas expression of the transcriptional repressor Bach1 (BTB and CNC homology 1) was reduced. Furthermore, the cytoprotective effects of AKBA against UVA-derived oxidative damage were accompanied by modulating expression of inflammatory mediators (i.e., cyclooxygenase-2 and nuclear factor-κB) and NOX1.AKBA protects skin cells from UVA-induced damage by modulating inflammatory mediators and/or ROS production. Therefore, AKBA has potential in the development of skin care products.© 2017 S.

Meanwhile complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is increasing, particularly herbal medicine. Boswellia serrata is a traditional Ayurvedic remedy with anti- properties, of interest for its usefulness in IBDs. The mechanism of this pharmacological potential of Boswellia serrata was investigated in colonic epithelial cell monolayers exposed to H2O2 or INF-γ+TNF-α, chosen as in vitro experimental model of intestinal inflammation. The barrier function was evaluated by the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and paracellular permeability assay, and by the tight junction proteins (zonula occludens-1, ZO-1 and occludin) immunofluorescence. The expression of phosphorylated NF-κB and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were determined by immunoblot and cytofluorimetric assay, respectively. Boswellia serrata oleo-gum extract (BSE) and its pure derivative acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), were tested at 0.1-10 μg/ml and 0.027 μg/ml, respectively. BSE and AKBA safety was demonstrated by no alteration of intestinal cell viability and barrier function and integrity biomarkers. H2O2 or INF-γ+TNF-α treatment of Caco-2 cell monolayers significantly reduced TEER, increased paracellular permeability and caused the disassembly of tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1. BSE and AKBA pretreatment significantly prevented functional and morphological alterations and also the NF-κB phosphorylation induced by the  stimuli. At the same concentrations BSE and AKBA counteracted the increase of ROS caused by H2O2 exposure. Data showed the positive correlation of the antioxidant activity with the mechanism involved in the physiologic maintenance of the integrity and function of the intestinal epithelium. This study elucidates the pharmacological mechanisms mediated by BSE, in protecting intestinal epithelial barrier from  damage and supports its use as safe adjuvant in patients affected by IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30084990>Chemoprevention of inflammation-related colorectal  by silymarin-, acetyl--, curcumin- and maltodextrin-enriched dietetic formulation in animal model.</a></h1><p>On the basis of preliminary in vitro experience, we assessed whether an enriched nutritional formulation with estrogen receptor (ER)-beta agonist and anti-inflammatory properties may prevent inflammation-associated colorectal  (CRC) in an animal model. Study sample enclosed 110 C57BL/6J male mice. Forty underwent dietary supplement safety assessment (20 standard diet and 20 enriched formulation). Seventy were treated with azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium and divided into two groups: 35 received standard diet and 35 enriched formulation (curcumin, boswellic acids, silymarin and maltodextrins). Miniature colonoscopy demonstrated colitis and solid lesion development in five mice/group 100 days after first AOM injection. Mice were killed after 10 days. In each group, four subgroups received intraperitoneal bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) injection at 24th/48th/72nd/96th hour before killing. Anti-inflammatory effect and chemoprevention were evaluated by lesion number/size, histological inflammation/dysplasia/neoplasia assessment, pro-inflammatory cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA), ER-beta/ER-alpha/BrdU immunohistochemistry and TUNEL immunofluorescence. Standard formulation assumption was associated with  shortening compared with enriched one (P = 0.04), which reduced solid lesion number and size (P < 0.001 for both), histological inflammation score (P = 0.04), pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression (P < 0.001), number of low-grade dysplasia (LGD; P = 0.03) and high-grade dysplasia (P < 0.001) areas. CRC was observed in 69.6% in standard and 23.5% in enriched formulation assuming animals (P < 0.001). Enriched formulation induced lower ER-alpha expression in CRC (P < 0.001) and higher ER-beta expression in LGD (P < 0.001) being associated to higher epithelial turnover (BrdU; P<0.001) in normal mucosa and increased apoptosis in LGD and CRC (P < 0.001 for both). Our results are promising for a successful anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive effect of enriched formulation in CRC arising from inflamed tissue.</p></html>
