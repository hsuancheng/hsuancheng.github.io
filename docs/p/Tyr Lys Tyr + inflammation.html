Because the peptide contains a tyrosine moiety, it can be readily labeled with a radioactive iodine. In this study, we investigated the possibility of abscess localization by i.v. administration of this radioiodinated CP. The peptide was iodinated with 125I using chloramine-T and purified using Bio-Gel P-2 chromatography. The final preparation had a purity of 88.5 +/- 3.8% (n = 6) and a specific radioactivity of 600-800 ci/mM. The iodinated CP bound to rabbit neutrophils specifically; its binding could be prevented by non-labeled CP. When 4-6 ng of 125-I-CP per kg body weight was injected into abscess-bearing rabbits, there was an immediate, but transient neutropenia, followed by a rebound neutrophilia. The abscess to muscle (A/M) ratio was 11.6 +/- 1.1 at 6 hrs and 11.0 +/- 4.7 at 24 hrs after injection; while the abscess to blood (A/B) ratio was 0.9 +/- 0.2 and 3.7 +/- 0.6 at 6 and 24 hrs post injection, respectively. Control animals injected with Na125I revealed an A/M ratio of 2.9 +/- 0.2 and an A/B ratio of 0.9 +/- 0.3 at 6 hrs after injection. Analysis of the radioactivity in the blood after 125I-CP administration, revealed that the majority (less than 87%) of the radioactivity was present as 125I-CP in the plasma fraction. Our results suggest that radioiodinated synthetic CP shows promise for abscess localization. However, further refinement of the method is required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22593948>Polyethylene glycol-Cys-Arg-Ser-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Val--Lys-tetramethylrhodamine.</a></h2><p>Extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion molecules consist of a complex network of fibronectins, collagens, chondroitins, laminins, glycoproteins, heparin sulfate, tenascins, and proteoglycans that surround connective tissue cells, and they are mainly secreted by fibroblasts, chondroblasts, and osteoblasts (1). Cell substrate adhesion molecules are considered essential regulators of cell migration, differentiation, and tissue integrity and remodeling. These molecules play a role in  and atherogenesis, but they also participate in the process of invasion and metastasis of malignant cells in the host tissue (2). Tumor cells adhere to the ECM, which provides a matrix environment for the permeation of tumor cells through the basal lamina and underlying interstitial stroma of the connective tissue. Overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other proteases by tumor cells allows intravasation of tumor cells into the circulatory system after degrading the basement membrane and ECM (3). Several families of MMPs are involved in atherogenesis, myocardial infarction, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion and metastases (4-7). MMP expression is highly regulated in normal cells, such as trophoblasts, osteoclasts, neutrophils, and macrophages. Elevated levels of MMPs have been found in tumors associated with a poor prognosis for cancer patients (8). The peptide Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Val-Arg-NH (GPLGVR) was found to be a MMP2/9 substrate and is cleaved between the Gly (G) and Val (V) residues (9). Chuang et al. (10) linked a hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) group to the N-terminus of Cys-Arg-Ser-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Val--Lys (CRSGPLGVYKK) and a hydrophobic tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) molecule to the C-terminus Lys (K) residue to form PEG-CRSGPLGVYKK-TMR (PEG-peptide-TMR) for optical imaging of protease activity . Upon MMP cleavage, the lipophilic VYKK-TMR is released and accumulated at the sites (cell surface) of protease activity. The accumulation was most likely attributed to the binding of the lipophilic VYKK-TMR to the cell membrane non-specifically. PEG-peptide-TMR accumulated in HT1080 tumors (with high MMP2 expression) but not in MCF-7 tumors (with low MMP2 expression), as determined with optical imaging in nude mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23792041>An endothelin-3-related synthetic biotinylated pentapeptide as a novel inhibitor of platelet-activating factor.</a></h2><p>Platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent proinflammatory mediator, is involved in many inflammatory diseases. We recently reported that synthetic biotinylated peptides having a -Asp-Gly sequence inhibit PAF-induced  by directly binding to PAF. In this study, we investigated the effect of two synthetic biotinylated peptides, both of which have a sequence similar to -Asp-Gly-an endothelin-3 (ET-3)-related biotinylated pentapeptide (-Asp-Lys-Glu, BPET3) and a scavenger receptor CD36-related biotinylated tetrapeptide (-Gly-Lys, BPCD36)-on PAF-induced  by using a rat model of hind paw oedema. BPET3 markedly inhibited PAF-induced oedema in a dose-dependent manner, and the dose that caused 50% inhibition was estimated to be approximately 2.64 nmol/paw. The inhibitory effect of BPCD36 on PAF-induced paw oedema was less than that of BPET3, while a synthetic biotinylated pentapeptide (Lys-Lys--Asp-Glu) shuffling amino acid sequence of BPET3, an ET-1-related synthetic biotinylated pentapeptide (Leu-Met-Asp-Lys-Glu), or an ET-2-related synthetic biotinylated pentapeptide (Trp-Leu-Asp-Lys-Glu) did not inhibit PAF-induced paw oedema. Furthermore, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence studies demonstrated that ET-3 specifically interacted with both PAF and its metabolite/precursor lyso-PAF. These results provide evidence that the -Asp region in both ET-3 and BPET3 is essential for marked inhibition of the peptide on PAF-induced , and strongly suggest that BPET3 may be useful as a novel anti-inflammatory drug targeting PAF.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We previously reported that synthetic biotinylated peptides having a -Asp-Gly sequence markedly inhibit PAF-induced  by direct binding, and that two synthetic fluorescence-labelled heptapeptides (Lys-Trp--Asp-Gly-Asp and D-Lys-Trp--Asp-Gly-Asp) with high stability in plasma specifically bind to PAF-like lipids (oxidized- and lyso-phosphatidylchoine). In this study, synthetic heptapeptides (Lys-Trp--Asp-Gly-Asp) coupled to a biotin molecule through the N-terminal amino group and ε-amino group of N-terminus Lys, (Btn)KP6 and K(Btn)P6, respectively, and their biotinylated peptides substituted with D-Lys at the N-terminus, (Btn)dKP6 and dK(Btn)P6, respectively, were investigated for their effects on PAF-induced . In the experiments using a rat model of hind paw oedema, (Btn)KP6, K(Btn)P6, (Btn)dKP6, and dK(Btn)P6 significantly inhibited PAF-induced paw oedema, with the highest inhibitory effect exhibited by dK(Btn)P6. The inhibitory effect of D--D-Lys-D-Asp-Gly tetrapeptide on PAF-induced paw oedema was much lower than that of -Asp-Gly tetrapeptide. In the experiments using tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, (Btn)KP6, K(Btn)P6, (Btn)dKP6, and dK(Btn)P6 bound to PAF dose-dependently, with dK(Btn)P6 showing the strongest binding affinity, indicating that its affinity appears to be closely correlated with its inhibitory effect on PAF-induced . These results suggest that direct binding of (Btn)KP6, K(Btn)P6, (Btn)dKP6, and dK(Btn)P6 to PAF can lead to marked inhibition of PAF-induced , and these agents, particularly dK(Btn)P6, may be useful as anti-inflammatory drugs targeting PAF with high stability in plasma.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Expression of the αβ integrin is strong on tumor cells and activated endothelial cells, whereas expression is weak on resting endothelial cells and most normal tissues. The αβ antagonists are being studied as antitumor and antiangiogenic agents and the agonists are being studied as angiogenic agents for coronary angiogenesis (6, 8, 9). The peptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) has been identified as a recognition motif used by extracellular matrix proteins (vitronectin, fibrinogen, laminin, and collagen) to bind to a variety of integrins, including αβ. Various radiolabeled antagonists have been introduced for imaging of tumors and tumor angiogenesis (10). Most of the cyclic RGD peptides are composed of five amino acids. Various cyclic RGD peptides exhibit selective inhibition of binding to αβ (50% inhibition concentration (IC), 7–40 nM) but not to αβ (IC, 600–4,000 nM) or αβ (IC, 700–5,000 nM) integrins (11).

HPLC analysis showed two major 99mTc-labeled peptide peaks, 99mTc-DADT-Pep-I and 99mTc-DADT-Pep-II, were obtained in a ratio of 1:0.85. Using an iodoacetamide-derivatized gel to remove unlabeled peptide from the 99mTc labeling mixtures, essentially no-carrier-added (nca) high-specific activity 99mTc-labeled chemotactic peptides were obtained. The 99Tc analogues of the peptides were synthesized (72% yield) in a similar fashion and correlated with 99mTc complexes I and II by HPLC. In vitro competitive receptor binding assays of the isolated 99Tc analogues were performed against the tritiated chemotactic peptide [3H]N-for-Met-Leu-Phe ([3H]fMLF) using isolated granulocytes. The 99Tc-derivatized peptides showed similar binding affinities to the chemoattractant receptor as the unlabeled Nalpha-for-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-. The nca 99mTc-labeled peptides gave high contrast images of experimental  in rabbits without causing neutropenia. Thus, it is feasible to attach the Tc-DADT chelate to low-molecular weight receptor binding chemotactic peptides and retain substantial binding to the receptor.

This anti-inflammatory effect is thought to be mediated through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), an enzyme important for prostaglandin synthesis. We have compared the effects of piroxicam on superoxide production mediated by two closely related G-protein coupled receptors expressed on neutrophils, the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) and the formyl peptide receptor like 1 (FPRL1). Neutrophils were stimulated with agonists that bind specifically to FPR (the peptide ligand N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, fMLF) or FPRL1 (the peptide ligand Trp-Lys--Met-Val-L-Met-NH(2), WKYMVM) or both of these receptors (the peptide ligand Trp-Lys--Met-Val-D-Met-NH(2), WKYMVm). Piroxicam reduced the neutrophil superoxide production induced by the FPR agonist but had no significant effect on the FPRL1 induced response. Neutrophil intracellular calcium changes induced by the agonist WKYMVm (that triggers both FPR and FPRL1) were only inhibited by piroxicam when the drug was combined with the FPRL1 specific antagonist, Trp-Arg-Trp-Trp-Trp-Trp (WRW(4)), and this was true also for the inhibition of superoxide anion release. Receptor-binding analysis showed that the fluorescently labelled FPR specific ligand N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle- (fNLFNYK), was competed for in a dose-dependent manner, by the FPR ligand fMLF and as well as by piroxicam. We show that piroxicam inhibits the neutrophil responses triggered through FPR, but not through FPRL1 and this inhibition is due to a reduced binding of the activating ligand to its cell surface receptor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20641712>Tc(CO)-Bipyridine-cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-).</a></h2><p>Integrins are a family of heterodimeric glycoproteins on cell surfaces that mediate diverse biological events involving cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (1).

However, the intrinsic fluorescence of biomolecules poses a problem when fluorophores that absorb visible light (350–700 nm) are used. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700–1,000 nm) detection avoids the background fluorescence interference of natural biomolecules, providing a high contrast between target and background tissues. NIR fluorophores have a wider dynamic range and minimal background as a result of reduced scattering compared with visible fluorescence detection. They also have high sensitivity, resulting from low fluorescence background, and high extinction coefficients, which provide high quantum yields. The NIR region is also compatible with solid-state optical components, such as diode lasers and silicon detectors. NIR fluorescence (NIRF) imaging is becoming a non-invasive alternative to radionuclide imaging in small animals (4, 5). Fluorescent semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are nanocrystals made of CdSe/CdTe-ZnS with radii of 1–10 nm (6-8). They can be tuned to emit light in a range of wavelengths by changing their sizes and composition, thus providing broad excitation profiles and high absorption coefficients. They have narrow and symmetric emission spectra with long excited-state lifetimes (20–50 ns) compared with fluorescent dyes (1–10 ns). QDs possess good quantum yields of 40–90% and high extinction coefficients, and they are more photo-stable than conventional organic dyes. They can be coated and capped with hydrophilic materials for additional conjugations with biomolecules, such as peptides, antibodies, nucleic acids, and small organic compounds, which are tested  and  (8-12). Although many cells have been labeled with QDs  with little cytotoxicity, there are only limited studies of long-term toxicity of QDs in small animals (13-21), and little is known about the toxicity and the mechanisms of clearance and metabolism of QDs in humans.

Since prior studies suggested that cultured bovine endothelial cells express high affinity binding sites for the neutrophil chemotactic oligopeptide formyl methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (f-Met-Leu-Phe), we sought to further characterize the interaction between formyl peptide chemoattractants and human vascular endothelial cells. Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and peripheral blood neutrophils specifically bound f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe, whereas specific binding to cultured fibroblasts, smooth muscle, and epithelial cells was negligible. Endothelial cells expressed 3.6 +/- 0.7 X 10(5) binding sites/cell with a Kd of 210 +/- 31 nM. Although the hexapeptide formyl norleucyl-leucyl-phenylalanyl-norleucyl- (f-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-) and the tetrapeptide f-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys completed with f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe for binding to endothelial cells, specific binding of 125I-f-Nl-Leu-Phe- or f-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys-fluorescein to endothelial cells was not observed, suggesting that steric constraints on formyl peptide binding differ between endothelial cells and leukocytes. At 37 degrees C, cell-associated f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe greatly exceeded that bound at 0 degrees C and was incorporated predominantly into a nondisplaceable compartment. Release of f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe or radioactive breakdown products from this compartment was time- and temperature-dependent with a t1/2 of approximately equal to 20 min at 37 degrees C. Resolution of the radioactive products released from f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe-loaded endothelial cells by thin layer chromatography indicated that greater than or equal to 57% of the released material co-migrated with intact f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe. Degradative release was blocked by agents that interfere with lysosomal acidification. The radioactive material released from f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe-loaded endothelial cells bound specifically to neutrophils. This binding was inhibited 50.2 +/- 6.4% by a greater than or equal to 10(3)-fold excess of nonradioactive f-Met-Leu-Phe whereas binding of authentic f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe was inhibited 89.4 +/- 3.0%.

NIR fluorescence imaging is becoming a non-invasive alternative to radionuclide imaging. Cyclo(RGDyK) was conjugated with Cy5.5 to study  biodistribution of the tracer in tumor-bearing mice. Cy5.5 is a NIR fluorescent dye with absorbance maximum at 675 nm and emission maximum at 694 nm with a high extinction coefficient of 250,000 (mol/L)cm.

However, the intrinsic fluorescence of biomolecules poses a problem when fluorophores that absorb visible light (350–700 nm) are used. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700–1,000 nm) detection avoids the background fluorescence interference of natural biomolecules, providing a high contrast between target and background tissues. NIR fluorophores have wider dynamic range and minimal background as a result of reduced scattering compared with visible fluorescence detection. They also have high sensitivity, resulting from low infrared background, and high extinction coefficients, which provide high quantum yields. The NIR region is also compatible with solid-state optical components, such as diode lasers and silicon detectors. NIR fluorescence imaging is becoming a noninvasive alternative to radionuclide imaging in small animals (4, 5). Fluorescent semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are nanocrystals made of CdSe/CdTe-ZnS with radii of 1–10 nm (6-8). They can be tuned to emit signals in a range of wavelengths by changing their sizes and composition, thus providing broad excitation profiles and high absorption coefficients. They have narrow, symmetric emission spectra with long, excited-state lifetimes (20–50 ns) compared with those of fluorescent dyes (1–10 ns). They process good quantum yields of 40%–90% and possess high extinction coefficients. They are more photo-stable than conventional organic dyes. They can be coated and capped with hydrophilic materials for additional conjugation with biomolecules, such as peptides, antibodies, nucleic acids, and small organic compounds, which have been tested  and  (8-12). Although many cells have been labeled with QDs  with little cytotoxicity, there are limited studies of long-term toxicity of QDs in small animals (13-21); little is known about the toxicity and the mechanisms of clearance and metabolism of QDs in humans. The performance of various nanoparticles for biomedical imaging has been reviewed (22, 23). Integrins are a family of heterodimeric, cell-surface glycoproteins that mediate diverse biological events involving cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions (24). Integrins comprise an α and a β subunit, and they are important for cell adhesion and signal transduction. The αβ integrin is the most prominent receptor class, affecting tumor growth, tumor invasiveness, metastasis, tumor-induced angiogenesis, , osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (25-30). The αβ integrin is strongly expressed on tumor cells and activated endothelial cells. In contrast, expression of αβ integrin is weak on resting endothelial cells and on most normal tissues. The αβ antagonists are being studied as anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic agents, and the agonists are being studied as angiogenic agents for coronary angiogenesis (29, 31, 32). A tripeptide sequence comprising Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) has been identified as a recognition motif used by extracellular matrix proteins (vitronectin, fibrinogen, laminin, and collagen) to bind to a variety of integrins including αβ. Various radiolabeled cyclic RGD peptides have been introduced for tumor imaging and tumor angiogenesis (33). QDs that do not contain Cd (non-Cd QDs) have been prepared as an alternative to the more toxic Cd-based QDs. These newly developed non-Cd QDs exhibit improved blood half-life and minimal reticuloendothelial system accumulation with rapid renal clearance (34). These QDs easily extravasate leaky tumor blood vessels because of their enhanced permeability and retention effects. Gao et al. (35) coated non-Cd QD800 (InAs/InP/ZnSe, emission maximum at 800 nm) with di-stearoyl-poly(ethylene glycol)-phosphatidylethanolamine 2000 (DSPE-PEG2000) and c(RGDyK) to form QD800-PEG-RGD for NIR fluorescence imaging of αβ integrin expression in the tumor vasculature in mice. QD800-PEG-RGD has been shown to have a high accumulation in tumors with little extravasation and a predominant liver accumulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6774048>Heterogeneity of human serum amyloid A proteins.</a></h2><p>Serum amyloid A proteins (SAA), presumed precursors of the tissue amyloid A proteins (AA) characteristic of secondary amyloidosis, have been isolated from the plasma high-density lipoproteins (HDL) of normals after etiocholanolone-induced  and from patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, systemic lupus erythematosis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, and Goodpasture's syndrome. At least six polymorphic forms of SAA wer identified among the low molecular weight proteins of HDL, and these comprosed up to 27% of the total HDL protein. Gel and ion-exchange chromatography permitted isolation of the SAA polymorphs in homogeneous form. Their amino acid compositions were very similar, they were indistinguishable in cationic and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis systems, and each had the terminal sequency COOH--Phe-. Charge heterogeneity in anionic-urea polyacrylamide gel electropherograms was unaffected by neuaminidase treatment, and none of the SAA protein bands stained with the periodate-Schiff reagent. The two major SAA polymorphs, designated SAA4 and SAA5 according to their order of elution from DEAE-cellulose, had different NH2-terminal sequences. Manual Edman degradation demonstrated NH2-arg-ser-phe-phe- for SAA4 and NH2-ser-phe-phe- for SAA5. This NH2-terminal heterogeneity corresponds to that most frequently reported for AA and suggests that microheterogeneity in SAA may underlie that already documented in AA. Sufficient quantitites of the other SAA polymorphs were not available for similar analyses, but the amino acid compositions do not indicate that NH2-terminal heterogeneity accounts for all of the observed polymorphism. Artifactual polymorphism also appears unlikely, and the heterogeneiy of SAA may reflect origin from more than one cell type with or without posttranslational modificaton. We calculate from quantitative COOH-terminal analyses that SAA is of 11,000-11,900 mol wt. Primary structure studies have shown AA t be a single chain protein of 76 residues, and SAA, therefore, appears to contain a peptide of 33 amino acids that is missing from AA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20641948>Acetyl-lys-lys-lys-lys-lys-cys-gly-cys-gly-gly-pro-leu--lys-ile-ile-lys-lys-leu-leu-glu-ser-heparin-[Tc] .</a></h2><p>Because of their ability to accumulate at sites of infection and , the leukocyte and monocyte components of the white blood cell (WBC) have often been labeled under  conditions with radioisotopes such as indium (In), meta-stable technetium (Tc), or radioactive compounds such as Tc-gluceptate, [Ga]gallium citrate, and Tc-labeled antibodies, etc (1). Radiolabeling of leukocytes or monocytes involves the isolation of these cells from the WBC pool, a process that is slow and expensive, involves the handling of blood, and can lead to contamination of the samples. In addition, the labeled cells have a slow clearance from circulation and may be imaged up to 24 h after administration to allow time for accumulation at the site of infection or . Also, these imaging agents usually have a low signal-to-noise ratio, especially during the early time points, and show a high intestinal uptake that interferes with diagnostic imaging of the abdominal area (2). Radioactively labeled monoclonal antibodies have been used for the imaging of infections, but these radiopharmaceuticals have limited application because they also have a slow clearance from circulation and are not always sensitive enough to detect pulmonary or bone infections (3, 4). In addition, labeled antibodies have been shown to induce transient neutropenia and the formation of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) (4, 5). The HAMA response can limit the repeat use of the antibodies because it neutralizes and alters the biodistribution of the agent (6). The use of peptides to detect sites of infection or  is an attractive option because these compounds are cheap and easy to synthesize, can be modified to suit target requirements, and show rapid clearance from circulation (7, 8). Chemotactic peptides have been developed and evaluated for the imaging of infections and , but these compounds have limitations because the buffer components used to label the peptides may influence their biodistribution characteristics (8). Moyer et al. identified and developed a heparin-binding peptide, P483, for the imaging of infections (9). The sequence of this peptide was based on the platelet factor-4 heparin-binding region. The peptide comprises 23 amino acids, was modified to contain a lysine-rich region to allow rapid renal clearance, and could be labeled with Tc. The peptide was complexed with heparin and labeled with Tc to generate Tc-P483H, a peptide that targets leukocytes (9). Conjugation of the peptide with heparin enhanced the binding of the labeled peptide to WBC. The labeled peptide was evaluated for the imaging of infections in a rabbit model and also in humans (9, 10).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20641803>Tc-Ethylenediaminediacetic acid/hydrazinonicotinic acid-cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Try-Lys) .</a></h2><p>Integrins are a family of heterodimeric glycoproteins on cell surfaces that mediate diverse biological events involving cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions (1).

Various radiolabeled cyclic RGD peptides have been found to have high accumulation in tumors in nude mice (12).

Binding of formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) by N-formyl peptides can activate neutrophils and may represent a new therapeutic target in either sterile or septic . Propofol, a widely used i.v. anesthetic, has been shown to modulate immunoinflammatory responses. However, the mechanism of propofol remains to be established. In this study, we showed that propofol significantly reduced superoxide generation, elastase release, and chemotaxis in human neutrophils activated by fMLF. Propofol did not alter superoxide generation or elastase release in a cell-free system. Neither inhibitors of γ-aminobutyric acid receptors nor an inhibitor of protein kinase A reversed the inhibitory effects of propofol. In addition, propofol showed less inhibitory effects in non-FPR1-induced cell responses. The signaling pathways downstream from FPR1, involving calcium, AKT, and ERK1/2, were also competitively inhibited by propofol. These results show that propofol selectively and competitively inhibits the FPR1-induced human neutrophil activation. Consistent with the hypothesis, propofol inhibited the binding of N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle--fluorescein, a fluorescent analog of fMLF, to FPR1 in human neutrophils, differentiated THP-1 cells, and FPR1-transfected human embryonic kidney-293 cells. To our knowledge, our results identify, for the first time, a novel anti-inflammatory mechanism of propofol by competitively blocking FPR1 in human neutrophils. Considering the importance of N-formyl peptides in inflammatory processes, our data indicate that propofol may have therapeutic potential to attenuate neutrophil-mediated inflammatory diseases by blocking FPR1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22334786>Analysis of in situ and ex vivo αVβ3 integrin expression during experimental carotid atherogenesis.</a></h2><p>Mural  has been shown to contribute to the development of plaque, with the α(V)β(3) integrin highly expressed in atherosclerotic plaques. We herein examined α(V)β(3) integrin expression as a function of carotid atherosclerosis formation in the apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mouse.Constrictive collars were placed around the left common carotid arteries of apo E(-/-) mice maintained on a high-fat diet (n = 14). Before and 21 days following collar placement, in vivo serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of the carotid aortic diameter were performed using a 7T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner. Near- infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging was performed (n = 6) using an in vivo imaging system 0-24 hours following administration of 1.0 nmol c(RGDyK)-Cy5.5 via the tail vein. A competition experiment was performed by the co-injection of a saturating dose of bicyclic RGD peptide H-Glu[cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-)]2 (n = 3). Following image acquisition and sacrifice at 24 hours after injection, carotid arteries were harvested for histological analyses. Neointima formation and arterial remodeling in the carotid arteries of apoE(-/-) mice were induced by the placement of a constrictive collar. Significantly greater fluorescent signals were obtained from constrictive collar left common carotid arteries as compared to uninvolved aortic segments in constrictive collar mice. Binding to stenotic lesions was efficiently blocked in competition experiments. Immunostaining confirmed the presence of mural α(V)β(3) integrin expression in macrophages in the neointima. Signal intensity increased in a macrophage density-dependent fashion in the stenotic segments.Mural α(V)β(3) integrin expression, as determined using RGD-Cy5.5 near-infrared optical imaging, was increased in carotid arteries with constrictive collars in experimental mice.

The inflammatory response is brought about by the binding of N-formyl peptide to formyl peptide receptors (FPRs), specific signaling receptors expressed on myeloid as well as non-myeloid cells involved in the inflammatory process. N-formyl peptides conjugated with fluorochromes, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) are increasingly experimentally used to identify tissues involved in . Hypothesizing that the process of FITC-conjugation may transfer formyl peptide to a ligand that is efficiently cleared from the circulation by the natural powerful hepatic scavenging regime we studied the biodistribution of intravenously administered FITC-fNLPNTL (Fluorescein-isothiocyanate- N-Formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-) in mice. Our findings can be summarized as follows: i) In contrast to unconjugated fNLPNTL, FITC-fNLPNTL was rapidly taken up in the liver; ii) Mouse and human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatocytes express formyl peptide receptor 1 (FRP1) on both mRNA (PCR) and protein (Western blot) levels; iii) Immunohistochemistry showed that mouse and human liver sections expressed FRP1 in LSECs and hepatocytes; and iv) Uptake of FITC-fNLPNTL could be largely blocked in mouse and human hepatocytes by surplus-unconjugated fNLPNTL, thereby suggesting that the hepatocytes in both species recognized FITC-fNLPNTL and fNLPNTL as indistinguishable ligands. This was in contrast to the mouse and human LSECs, in which the uptake of FITC-fNLPNTL was mediated by both FRP1 and a scavenger receptor, specifically expressed on LSECs. Based on these results we conclude that a significant proportion of FITC-fNLPNTL is taken up in LSECs via a scavenger receptor naturally expressed in these cells. This calls for great caution when using FITC-fNLPNTL and other chromogen-conjugated formyl peptides as a probe to identify cells in a liver engaged in . Moreover, our finding emphasizes the role of the liver as an important neutralizer of otherwise strong inflammatory signals such as formyl peptides.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24055926>Common mechanism in endothelin-3 and PAF receptor function for anti-inflammatory responses.</a></h2><p>Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent lipid mediator that is implicated in numerous inflammatory diseases. Under inflammatory conditions, PAF is biosynthesized through the remodelling pathway and elicits many inflammatory responses through binding to its specific PAF receptor. Endogenous bioactive endothelins (ETs: ET-1, -2, and -3) are also considered potent inflammatory mediators that play a critical role in many inflammatory diseases. In this perspective, we provide a brief overview of possible common mechanisms in ETs and PAF receptor function for inflammatory responses. Accumulating evidence strongly suggests that ET-3, but not ET-1 and ET-2, can attenuate PAF-induced  through direct binding of the -Asp (YKD) region in the peptide to PAF and its metabolite/precursor lyso-PAF, followed by inhibition of binding between PAF and its receptor. Additionally, YKD sequence-containing peptides may be useful as a novel type of anti-inflammatory drugs targeting this mechanism. These findings should lead to new treatment strategies for numerous inflammatory diseases by targeting the common mechanism in ET and PAF receptor function.© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) is a G protein-coupled chemoattractant receptor expressed mainly on leukocytes. Surprisingly, aging Fpr1(-/-) mice develop spontaneous lens degeneration without  or infection (J.-L. Gao et al., manuscript in preparation). Therefore, we hypothesized that FPR1 is functionally expressed directly on lens epithelial cells, the only cell type in the lens. Consistent with this, the human fetal lens epithelial cell line FHL 124 expressed FPR1 mRNA and was strongly FPR1 protein-positive by Western blot and FACS. Competition binding using FPR1 ligands N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle- (Nle = Norleucine), formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, and peptide W revealed the same profile for FHL 124 cells, neutrophils, and FPR1-transfected HEK 293 cells. Saturation binding with fluorescein-labeled N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle- revealed ~2500 specific binding sites on FHL-124 cells (K(D) ~ 0.5 nm) versus ~40,000 sites on neutrophils (K(D) = 3.2 nm). Moreover, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine induced pertussis toxin-sensitive Ca(2+) flux in FHL 124 cells, consistent with classic G(i)-mediated FPR1 signaling. FHL 124 cell FPR1 was atypical in that it resisted agonist-induced internalization. Expression of FPR1 was additionally supported by detection of the intact full-length open reading frame in sequenced cDNA from FHL 124 cells. Thus, FHL-124 cells express functional FPR1, which is consistent with a direct functional role for FPR1 in the lens, as suggested by the phenotype of Fpr1 knock-out mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22593944>Polyethylene glycol-Cys-Arg-Ser-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Val--[F]fluorobenzoyl-Lys-Lys-tetramethylrhodamine.</a></h2><p>Extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion molecules consist of a complex network of fibronectins, collagens, chondroitins, laminins, glycoproteins, heparin sulfate, tenascins, and proteoglycans that surround connective tissue cells, and they are mainly secreted by fibroblasts, chondroblasts, and osteoblasts (1). Cell substrate adhesion molecules are considered essential regulators of cell migration, differentiation, and tissue integrity and remodeling. These molecules play a role in  and atherogenesis, but they also participate in the process of invasion and metastasis of malignant cells in the host tissue (2). Tumor cells adhere to the ECM, which provides a matrix environment for the permeation of tumor cells through the basal lamina and underlying interstitial stroma of the connective tissue. Overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other proteases by tumor cells allows intravasation of tumor cells into the circulatory system after degrading the basement membrane and ECM (3). Several families of MMPs are involved in atherogenesis, myocardial infarction, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion and metastases (4-7). MMP expression is highly regulated in normal cells, such as trophoblasts, osteoclasts, neutrophils, and macrophages. Elevated levels of MMPs have been found in tumors associated with a poor prognosis for cancer patients (8). The peptide Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Val-Arg-NH (GPLGVR) was found to be a MMP2/9 substrate and is cleaved between the Gly (G) and Val (V) residues (9). Chuang et al. (10) linked a hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) group to the N-terminus of Cys-Arg-Ser-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Val--Lys (CRSGPLGVYKK) and a hydrophobic tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) molecule to the C-terminus Lys (K) residue to form PEG-CRSGPLGVYKK-TMR (PEG-peptide-TMR) for optical imaging of protease activity . Upon MMP cleavage, the lipophilic VYKK-TMR was released and accumulated at the sites (cell surface) of protease activity. The accumulation was most likely attributed to the binding of the lipophilic VYKK-TMR to the cell membrane non-specifically. For positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, the other Lys residue in PEG-peptide-TMR was labeled with 4-[F]fluorobenzoate to form PEG-peptide-[F]-TMR. PEG-peptide-[F]-TMR accumulated in HT1080 tumors (with high MMP2 expression) but not in MCF-7 tumors (with low MMP2 expression), as determined with optical imaging in nude mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18768476>Discovery of mitocryptide-1, a neutrophil-activating cryptide from healthy porcine heart.</a></h2><p>Although neutrophils are known to migrate in response to various chemokines and complement factors, the substances involved in the early stages of their transmigration and activation have been poorly characterized to date. Here we report the discovery of a peptide isolated from healthy porcine hearts that activated neutrophils. Its primary structure is H-Leu-Ser-Phe-Leu-Ile-Pro-Ala-Gly-Trp-Val-Leu-Ser-His-Leu-Asp-His--Arg-Ser-Ser-Ala-Ala-OH, and it was indicated to originate from mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIII. This peptide caused chemotaxis at concentrations lower than that inducing beta-hexosaminidase release. Such responses were observed in neutrophilic/granulocytic differentiated HL-60 cells but not in undifferentiated cells, and G(i2)-type G proteins were suggested to be involved in the peptide signaling. Moreover the peptide activated human neutrophils to induce beta-hexosaminidase secretion. A number of other amphipathic neutrophil-activating peptides presumably originating from mitochondrial proteins were also found. The present results suggest that neutrophils monitor such amphipathic peptides including the identified peptide as an initiation signal for  at injury sites.</p></html>
