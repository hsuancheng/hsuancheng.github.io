<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30097463>Double-blind, randomized, multicenter phase 2 study of SC411 in children with sickle cell disease (SCOT trial).</a></h2><p>Blood cell membranes in sickle cell disease (SCD) have low docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA treatment reduces sickle cell crisis (SCC) rate and ameliorates the inflammation, oxidative stress, and hypercoagulable state of SCD. SC411 is a novel DHA ethyl ester formulation with a proprietary delivery platform (Advanced Lipid Technology) that enhances DHA bioavailability. The SCOT trial investigated the effect of 3 different doses of SC411 on clinical and biochemical endpoints in 67 children with SCD (5-17 years old). Seventy-six percent of subjects were also receiving hydroxyurea. After 4 weeks of treatment with SC411 at 20, 36, and 60 mg DHA/kg per day or placebo a statistically significant ( < .001) mean percentage increase of blood cell membrane DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid was seen vs baseline: 109.0% (confidence interval [CI], 46.7-171.3), 163.8% (CI, 108.3-219.2), 170.8% (CI, 90.2-251.4), and 28.6% (CI, 250.1 to 107.3), respectively. After 8 weeks of treatment, statistically significant changes vs placebo were also observed in D-dimer ( = .025) and soluble E-selectin ( = .0219) in subjects exposed to 36 mg/kg. A significant increase in hemoglobin was observed against placebo in subjects receiving 20 mg DHA/kg per day ( = .039). SC411 significantly reduced electronic diary recorded SCC, analgesic use at home, and days absent from school because of sickle cell pain. The lower rate of clinical SCC observed in the pooled active groups vs placebo did not reach statistical significance (rate ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.20-1.11;  = .07). All tested doses were safe and well tolerated.

Appearance of 14C-labelled plasma polar and neutral lipids over 4 h and retention of 14C-activity (R) in the tissues at 4 h were measured.Compared to OM3EE, OM3CA resulted in 2- and 3-fold higher areas under the plasma 14C-labelled polar and neutral lipid curves (exposures), respectively, as well as, higher R in all tissues examined. For both OM3CA and OM3EE, R varied in a tissue specific manner; highest in liver, followed by red skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, brain and white skeletal muscle. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that R in each tissue (except liver) was dependent on polar lipid exposure alone (r2>0.87 and P<0.001), but not neutral lipid exposure, and furthermore this dependence was indistinguishable for OM3CA and OM3EE. In the liver, R was found to be dependent on both polar and neutral lipid exposures (r2 = 0.97, P<0.001), with relative contributions of 85±2% and 15±2%, respectively. As for the other tissues, these dependencies were indistinguishable for OM3CA and OM3EE.The present results, in fasted low-fat diet fed rats, are consistent with higher oral bioavailability of OM3CA versus OM3EE forms of DHA. Once DHA has entered the circulation, the tissue distribution is independent of the dosed form and uptake in the skeletal muscle, fat and brain is driven by the polar pools of DHA in plasma, while DHA accretion in liver is supplied by both polar and neutral plasma lipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28284721>The hydroxylated form of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA-H) modifies the brain lipid composition in a model of Alzheimer's disease, improving behavioral motor function and survival.</a></h2><p>We have compared the effect of the commonly used ω-3 fatty acid,  (DHA-EE), and of its 2-hydroxylated DHA form (DHA-H), on brain lipid composition, behavior and lifespan in a new human transgenic Drosophila melanogaster model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The transgenic flies expressed human Aβ42 and tau, and the overexpression of these human transgenes in the CNS of these flies produced progressive defects in motor function (antigeotaxic behavior) while reducing the animal's lifespan. Here, we demonstrate that both DHA-EE and DHA-H increase the longer chain fatty acids (≥18C) species in the heads of the flies, although only DHA-H produced an unknown chromatographic peak that corresponded to a non-hydroxylated lipid. In addition, only treatment with DHA-H prevented the abnormal climbing behavior and enhanced the lifespan of these transgenic flies. These benefits of DHA-H were confirmed in the well characterized transgenic PS1/APP mouse model of familial AD (5xFAD mice), mice that develop defects in spatial learning and in memory, as well as behavioral deficits. Hence, it appears that the modulation of brain lipid composition by DHA-H could have remedial effects on AD associated neurodegeneration.

The objective of the 9-month study was to evaluate safety of DHA-EE administered to beagle dogs at dose levels 150, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg bw/day by oral gavage and to determine reversibility of any findings after a 2-month recovery period. DHA-EE was well tolerated at all doses. There were observations of dry flaky skin with occasional reddened areas at doses ≥1000 mg/kg bw/day. These findings lacked any microscopic correlate and were no longer present after the recovery period. There were no toxicologically relevant findings in body weights, body weight gains, food consumption, ophthalmological examinations, and ECG measurements. Test article-related changes in hematology parameters were limited to decreases in reticulocyte count in the high-dose males and considered non-adverse. In clinical chemistry parameters, dose-related decreases in cholesterol and triglycerides levels were observed at all doses in males and females and attributed to the known lipid-lowering effects of DHA. There were no effects on other clinical chemistry, urinalysis or coagulation parameters. There were no abnormal histopathology findings attributed to test article. The No-Observable-Adverse-Effect Level of DHA-EE was established at 2000 mg/kg bw/day for both genders.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p></html>
